https://openalex.org/W2130323165,"α-Synuclein is a highly conserved presynaptic protein of unknown function. A mutation in the protein has been causally linked to Parkinson's disease in humans, and the normal protein is an abundant component of the intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) characteristic of the disease. α-Synuclein is also the precursor to an intrinsic component of extracellular plaques in Alzheimer's disease. The α-synuclein sequence is largely composed of degenerate 11-residue repeats reminiscent of the amphipathic α-helical domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins. We hypothesized that α-synuclein should associate with phospholipid bilayers and that this lipid association should stabilize an α-helical secondary structure in the protein. We report that α-synuclein binds to small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles containing acidic phospholipids, but not to vesicles with a net neutral charge. We further show that the protein associates preferentially with vesicles of smaller diameter (20–25 nm) as opposed to larger (∼125 nm) vesicles. Lipid binding is accompanied by an increase in α-helicity from 3% to approximately 80%. These observations are consistent with a role in vesicle function at the presynaptic terminal. α-Synuclein is a highly conserved presynaptic protein of unknown function.

Our studies in songbird brain resulted in the identification of a presynaptic protein, which we called synelfin, whose expression is regulated in the avian song control circuit during the critical period for song learning (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this protein might play an important role in the modulation of synaptic plasticity, and have focused on determining its normal cellular and biochemical function. Independent evidence has emerged that implicates this protein in human neurodegenerative disease. Ueda et al. (2Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D. Kondo J. Ihara Y.

More recently, Polymeropoulos et al.(3Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehijia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M. Duvoisin R.C. Di Iorio G. Golbe L.I. Nussbaum R.L. Science. 1997; 276: 2045-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (6785) Google Scholar) described a mutation in the identical protein α-synuclein, which apparently causes a hereditary form of Parkinson's disease. This neurodegenerative disease is also characterized by the abnormal deposition of cellular material, in this case the intracellular inclusions known as Lewy bodies (4Okazaki H. Lipkin L.E. Aronson S.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1961; 20: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and these structures are also immunopositive for α-synuclein (5Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M.-Y. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (6342) Google Scholar). Synelfin/α-synuclein/NACP (which we will henceforth refer to as α-synuclein) is a small, soluble protein of 140–143 amino acids which is highly enriched in presynaptic nerve terminals (1George J.M.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). The mechanism of its localization is unclear, however, because unlike most presynaptic proteins, α-synuclein is not tightly associated with either the synaptic vesicle or the synaptic plasma membrane (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The α-synuclein sequence has been extremely well conserved in evolution (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Maroteaux L. Scheller R.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1991; 11: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 9Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), implying functional constraints on its three-dimensional structure. Paradoxically, its conformation in solution appears to be largely random, as estimated from circular dichroism measurements (10Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). The most notable feature of the sequence is a recurring 11-residue periodicity, which is consistent with the capacity to fold into an amphipathic α-helix (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). When projected onto a helical wheel (11Schiffer A. Edmundson A.B. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar), several of the α-synuclein 11-mers display a distinctive distribution of polar and nonpolar residues to opposite faces of the helix, which conforms very well to the consensus class A2 amphipathic α-helix, found in the lipid-binding domains of the exchangeable apolipoproteins A-II, C-I, C-II, and C-III (12Segrest J. De Loof H. Dohlman J. Brouillette C. Anantharamaiah G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 8: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 13Segrest J. Jones M. De Loof H. Brouillette C. Venkatachalapathi Y. Anantharamaiah G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Observation of this structural motif led us to hypothesize that: 1) α-synuclein would have the capacity to associate with phospholipid membranes, and 2) membrane association would be dependent upon an α-helical secondary structure. Here we show data in support of both of these hypotheses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to the exchangeable apolipoproteins, α-synuclein binds exclusively to acidic phospholipids and preferentially to vesicles with smaller diameters. These observations suggest that the secondary structure of α-synuclein might be sufficient to target it to a particular subset of vesicles in the presynaptic terminal, perhaps facilitating selective regulation of some aspect of vesicle function. Bovine brain phospholipid extract (Folch extract 1) and egg ovalbumin were purchased from Sigma (+99% grade). 1-Palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), and liver phosphatidylinositol (PI) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). All other reagents were analytical grade. The canary α-synuclein cDNA was subcloned into the plasmid pET28a (Novagen), which directs expression in Escherichia coli via an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter. Purification of α-synuclein was based on a modification of Weinreb et al. (10Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), who documented the heat stability of the protein; briefly, cell lysates are boiled, and the soluble fraction is precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The pellet is resuspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 9.0, loaded onto a Poros HQ column (Perseptive Biosystems), and eluted with 0–1 m NaCl. α-Synuclein containing fractions are pooled and exchanged into sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0, loaded onto a Poros HS column (Perseptive Biosystems), and eluted with 0–1 m NaCl. α-Synuclein fractions are finally loaded onto a gel exclusion column (Superose 6, Pharmacia) to confirm purity and achieve final buffer exchange. SUV of various lipid compositions were prepared by the sonication technique of Barenholz et al.(14Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). The SUV were reisolated by ultracentrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor for 2 h at 25 °C and exhibited hydrodynamic diameters of 25 ± 5 nm as estimated by gel filtration chromatography (15Davidson W.S.

LUV were prepared as described by Hope et al. (16Hope M.J. Nayar R. Mayer L.D. Cullis P.R. Gregoriadis G. Liposome Technology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 123-139Google Scholar). Briefly, phospholipid multilamellar liposomes in buffer were placed into an extrusion device (Lipex Biomembranes Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada) which passed the mixture through polycarbonate filters of 100-nm pore size under pressures of 100–500 p.s.i. This procedure routinely produced unilamellar vesicles with hydrodynamic diameters of 125 ± 30 nm. SUV or LUV preparations in Tris buffer were mixed with α-synuclein to determine the affinity of α-synuclein for lipid surfaces of varying curvature. The vesicles and α-synuclein at a 20:1 mass ratio of phospholipid to α-synuclein were incubated in Tris buffer for 2–24 h at 25 °C. The resulting complexes were separated from unreacted lipid and protein on a calibrated Superose 6 (10 mm × 30 cm) gel filtration column (Pharmacia) eluted at 0.5 ml/min with Tris buffer. The protein content of the fractions was determined using the Markwell modification of the Lowry protein assay (17Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Biever L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5356) Google Scholar) while phospholipids were determined as inorganic phosphorus by the method of Sokoloff and Rothblat (18Sokoloff L. Rothblat G.H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In some experiments, the fractions corresponding to lipid-free protein, SUV and any multilamellar vesicles were pooled and analyzed by immunoblotting with α-synuclein monoclonal H3C, as described in Ref.1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar. The structural predictions based on the primary sequence of canary α-synuclein (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) were determined using programs ANTHEPROT (19Geourjon C. Deleage G. Comp. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 87-91PubMed Google Scholar) and the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis program (Genetics Computer Group) running on an IBM PC. Three algorithms, the Levin homologue method (20Levin J.M. Garnier J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 955: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the GOR 1 prediction method (21Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robeson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar), and the Chou-Fasman prediction method (22Chou P. Fasman G. Adv. Enzymol. 1978; 47: 45-148PubMed Google Scholar) were used for the sequence analysis because of their distinct prediction strategies. Consensus predictions were obtained from the results of all three methods by manual comparison of the predictions for each amino acid in the sequence (see the legend to Fig. 5 for more detail). For more information on the application of these established prediction methods to lipid-binding proteins, see Ref. 23Nolte R.T. Atkinson D. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1221-1239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar. The average secondary structure contents of lipid-free and lipid-bound α-synuclein were determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were taken at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette containing the sample at concentrations of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml of protein in 20 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8.0, without NaCl. The spectra were corrected for buffer and vesicle contributions as appropriate. The percent α-helix was determined from the molar ellipticities at 222 nm (42Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar) as well as by computer fitting to a library of CD spectra from proteins of known structure using the learning neural network program K2D which is based on the algorithm published by Andrade et al. (24Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The identification of several predicted class A2 amphipathic α-helices in the α-synuclein sequence suggested that α-synuclein might exhibit traits that are characteristic of the plasma apolipoproteins. Experiments showed that recombinant α-synuclein could not clear multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes, whereas apoA-I readily cleared them into small disc-shaped particles (data not shown). Furthermore, α-synuclein did not yield protein-lipid complexes using the sodium cholate method of reconstituted high density lipoprotein preparation commonly used with apoA-I (data not shown). Finally, studies using the chemical cross-linking agent BS3 failed to demonstrate self-association of α-synuclein when free in solution (not shown), a common observation with apolipoproteins. Taken together, these results indicate that despite similarities in predicted structure, α-synuclein does not possess the critical properties of apolipoproteins. However, numerous data document a tendency of α-synuclein to colocalize with synaptic vesicles in vivo (6Withers G. George J. Banker G. Clayton D.F. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 25Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Irizarry M.C.

Neurol. 1996; 55: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the presence of predicted lipid-binding helices suggests a lipid association. We decided to try SUV, which are relatively homogeneous, can be analyzed by gel exclusion chromatography, have sizes in the range of synaptic vesicles, and are compatible with circular dichroism as a means of estimating protein secondary structure. SUV were prepared from a commercially available brain phospholipid extract (Folch fraction I, Sigma) or synthetic POPC, and incubated with recombinant α-synuclein for 2–24 h at room temperature. The incubation mixture was then separated into various size components by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1). The resulting fractions were analyzed for protein and phospholipid content. The phospholipid profile from the column runs routinely showed two size populations. The earlier peak (fractions 17–19) was due to large multilamellar vesicles (MLV), whereas the later peak (centered around fraction 25) was due to SUV that were about 20–25 nm in diameter (15Davidson W.S. Rodrigueza W.V. Lund-Katz S. Johnson W.J. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17106-17113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). 70% of the α-synuclein that was incubated with brain extract vesicles remained associated with the SUV while the remainder eluted at a volume that was characteristic of the free protein. No α-synuclein was found in the MLV fractions (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, α-synuclein did not associate with the synthetic POPC SUV; 100% of the protein eluted in the lipid-free form. Control incubations were performed using egg ovalbumin which has no known lipid surface activity (Fig. 1, B and D). Ovalbumin did not associate with either type of vesicle, indicating that the association of α-synuclein with the brain extract vesicles shown in Fig. 1 A was not due to nonspecific association or trapping of the protein molecules within the vesicles. Lot analysis indicated that Sigma brain extract I contained 50–55% phosphatidylserine (PS), 10–12% PI, and 10% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), with 23–30% unknown phospholipids. Both PS and PI have a net negative charge compared with PE and PC, which have no net charge. To determine if the presence of the acidic lipids was responsible for the preferential binding of α-synuclein to BE1 vesicles versusPOPC vesicles, we performed a series of incubations using vesicles composed of 1:1 (w/w) mixtures of purified phospholipids. The incubations were performed exactly as those in Fig. 1. After separation on the column, the fractions corresponding to MLV, SUV, and lipid-free protein peaks were pooled. Equal fractions of each of the pooled peaks were run on an SDS gel and then immunoblotted with the H3C monoclonal antibody to the C terminus of α-synuclein (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In the absence of phospholipid, all of the α-synuclein appeared in the lipid-free fraction as expected. α-Synuclein did not bind to SUV or MLV composed of PC only, nor did it bind to a 1:1 mixture of PC and PE. However, when acidic lipids such as PS, phosphatidic acid (PA), and PI were mixed with either PC or PE, significant amounts of α-synuclein eluted in the SUV fractions but not in the MLV fractions. In the cases of the PA and PI containing vesicles, close to 100% of the α-synuclein was found in the SUV fractions whereas in the case of the PS containing vesicles 10–15% of the α-synuclein remained in the lipid-free fractions. The α-synuclein-vesicle complexes were found to be stable for at least 2 weeks at room temperature. Separate experiments were performed to determine the relative amount of acidic lipid to PC required for efficient α-synuclein binding to SUV. Acidic lipid concentrations of 30–50% of the vesicle weight were required to approach 100% binding under these conditions (data not shown). As the acidic lipid content was reduced to 20% or less, increasing amounts of α-synuclein appeared in the lipid-free form. The incubation with the PI-containing vesicles appeared to produce covalently linked oligomers of α-synuclein when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The cause of this is not clear, although it is possible that products of lipid peroxidation may be responsible for protein cross-linking. The PI used in these experiments was purified from bovine liver whereas the other lipids were synthetic, monounsaturated lipids that are resistant to lipid oxidation. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that α-synuclein can bind to SUV which contain negatively charged phospholipids. These data suggested a greater affinity for the SUV versus the MLV, but since the larger vesicles are multilamellar (with a smaller proportion of lipid accessible for surface binding) this observation was inconclusive. To determine whether α-synuclein has a similar affinity for more planar, less curved lipid surfaces, the binding of α-synuclein to LUV was compared with that of the SUV. We chose lipid compositions of either PC/PA (1:1) or PC alone, since these gave the most and least α-synuclein binding, respectively, in the SUV experiments. The LUV had hydrodynamic diameters of 125 ± 30 nm, whereas the SUV measured 20–25 nm. The results are shown in Table I. α-Synuclein did not bind to vesicles that contained only PC, regardless of size. In the case of the PC/PA vesicles, binding to the LUV was less than to the SUV in incubations with identical input amounts of protein and phospholipid. This result indicate that α-synuclein has a higher affinity for smaller vesicles with highly curved surfaces but will still bind more planar surfaces as long as acidic phospholipids are present.Table IComparison of α-synuclein binding to unilamellar phospholipid vesicles of different sizeVesicle composition1-aValues in this table are derived from two independent experiments done in triplicate (n = 6).Binding to SUV (≈25 nm diameter)Binding bcto LUV (≈125 nm diameter)μg α-synuclein/mg PLPC/PA 1:1 (w/w)120 ± 1040 ± 20PC only2 ± 2>11-a Values in this table are derived from two independent experiments done in triplicate (n = 6). Open table in a new tab The observed requirement for acidic phospholipids suggests that ionic interactions may occur between the protein and the lipid surface. To determine the importance of such interactions, α-synuclein was incubated with PC/PA vesicles under conditions of increasing NaCl concentration. Fig. 3 shows a plot of the SUV data. The amount of α-synuclein binding decreased somewhat with increasing ionic strength, but binding was not abolished even at 750 mm NaCl. This result suggests that ionic interactions play a role in the surface binding process, but the fact that binding could not be further inhibited indicates that additional forces must also help stabilize the protein-lipid interaction. Circular dichroism spectroscopy was used to determine the effects of lipid binding on the secondary structure of α-synuclein. The spectrum of lipid-free α-synuclein is shown in Fig. 4 A. The prominent minimum ellipticity at 200 nm was characteristic of a high percentage of random coil. Table II lists the predicted secondary structure compositions based on the CD spectrum from 200 to 241 nm. The data indicate that lipid-free α-synuclein is highly unstructured in solution. This is in strong agreement with the results of Weinreb et al. (10Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar) for human α-synuclein. Upon lipid binding, α-synuclein undergoes a striking change in conformation (Fig. 4 A, Table II), shifting to a highly α-helical conformation as evidenced by the characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm. The helical character of the protein increased from less than 3% to greater than 71% α-helix when bound to lipid. A similar change in conformation was observed when α-synuclein bound to PC/PS vesicles (Fig. 4 B), although the helical content was not as high as in the case of the PC/PA vesicles. This difference is due to the spectral contribution of lipid-free α-synuclein, which was present only in the PC/PS incubations (see Fig. 2). The incubation of α-synuclein with PC-only vesicles resulted in a CD spectrum that resembled lipid-free α-synuclein, confirming that α-synuclein did not bind to these vesicles. The secondary structure content of α-synuclein bound to PC/PA vesicles was also measured under conditions of increasing ionic strength. Table III shows that as the NaCl concentration was increased, the degree of α-helix content decreased with a corresponding increase in the estimated amount of random coil content. These changes in structure generally correlated with the decreases in α-synuclein binding shown in Fig. 3. In a single experiment with a small amount of recombinant human NACP/α-synuclein (a kind gift of Peter Lansbury), we observed a qualitatively similar increase in α-helical content when the protein associated with PC/PA vesicles (data not shown).Table IICircular dichroism evaluation of the secondary structure of recombinant human α-synuclein in the lipid-free state and bound to SUVs of varying compositionSample2-aValues in this table are derived from three independent experiments each done in triplicate (n = 9).α-Helix content from ellipticity at 222 nm2-bDetermined from molar ellipticities at 222 nm by the method of Chen et al.

Open table in a new tab To determine the regions of α-synuclein that undergo lipid-induced structural changes, we first performed computer-generated secondary structure predictions using the primary sequence of the protein. Three structural prediction algorithms (see “Methods”) varied in their estimates of overall secondary structure (not shown), with consensus values of 56% α-helix, 10% β-sheet, 0% turn, 27% random coil, and 7% undetermined. These values differ significantly from estimates based on circular dichroism measurements in either the presence or absence of vesicles (Table II), probably because the algorithms do not adequately model the stabilization of secondary structure by associated lipid, which appears to be critical in the case of α-synuclein. For this reason, a modelling strategy was applied which was originally developed for analysis of the exchangeable apolipoproteins (13Segrest J. Jones M. De Loof H. Brouillette C. Venkatachalapathi Y. Anantharamaiah G. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 141-166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like the apolipoproteins, much of the α-synuclein sequence is composed of repetitions of a degenerate 11-mer sequence which can form an amphipathic α-helix with a conserved arrangement of acidic, basic, and hydrophobic residues (1George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). We subjected the entire α-synuclein sequence to helical wheel analysis, and identified 5 potential amphipathic α-helices which encompass all of the 11-mer repeats and some adjacent amino acid residues; these are illustrated in Fig. 5. Helices 1–4 (residues 1–60) conform to the class A2consensus (see “Discussion”), distinguished by clustered basic residues at the polar/nonpolar interface and positioned ± 100° from the center of the nonpolar face; a preponderance of lysine relative to arginine among these basic residues; and several glutamate r"

To elucidate the mechanisms involved in this apoptosis, we studied the apoptosis-inducing activity in lipid fractions of oxLDL and the roles of two common mechanisms, ceramide generation and the activation of caspases, in apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with oxLDL. We also studied the effects of antioxidants and cholesterol. oxLDL induced endothelial apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. Apoptosis-inducing activity was recovered in the neutral lipid fraction of oxLDL. Various oxysterols in this fraction induced endothelial apoptosis. Neither the phospholipid fraction nor its component lysophosphatidylcholine induced apoptosis. oxLDL induced ceramide accumulation temporarily at 15 min in a dose-dependent fashion. Two inhibitors of acid sphinogomyelinase inhibited both the increase in ceramide and the apoptosis induced by oxLDL. Furthermore, a membrane-permeable ceramide (C2-ceramide) induced endothelial apoptosis. These findings demonstrated that ceramide generation by acid sphingomyelinase is indispensable for the endothelial apoptosis induced by oxLDL. Inhibitors of both caspase-1 and caspase-3 inhibited the apoptosis, suggesting that oxLDL induced apoptosis by activating these cysteine proteases. The antioxidants butylated hydroxytoluene and superoxide dismutase but not catalase inhibited the apoptosis induced by oxLDL or 25-hydroxycholesterol. This suggests not only that superoxide plays an important role but also that a critical interaction between oxLDL and the cell takes place on the outer surface of the membrane, because superoxide dismutase is not membrane-permeable. Exogenous cholesterol also inhibited the apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that neutral lipids in oxLDL induce endothelial apoptosis by activating membrane sphingomyelinase in a superoxide-dependent manner, as well as by activating caspases.

Horie S. Kazama M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8458-8465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These changes consequently trigger a series of cellular responses in the arterial wall that result in the formation of atheromatous lesions. oxLDL also affects the later stage of atherosclerosis by its toxicity. oxLDL and its lipid components cause the release of lactic dehydrogenase from cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts (6Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and decrease the number of these cells (6Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cytotoxicity of oxLDL is one of the factors that make atheromatous plaques unstable and prone to rupture (23Bjorkerud S. Bjorkerud B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the cytotoxicity of oxLDL has been partly attributed to induction of apoptosis. oxLDL induces both the morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis in cultured smooth muscle cells (24Bjorkerud B.

The apoptosis of vascular cells plays a role in both the progression and the regression of atherosclerotic lesions (23Bjorkerud S. Bjorkerud B. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar, 29Isner J.M. Kearney M. Bortman S. Passeri J. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2703-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 30Han D.K.M.

Different agents, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, ionizing radiation, UV radiation, hydrogen peroxide (32de Bono D.P. Yang W.D. Atherosclerosis. 1995; 114: 235-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), high glucose (33Baumgartner-Parzer S.M. Wagner L. Pettermann M. Grillari J. Gessl A. Waldhausl W. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and growth factor deprivation (34Araki S. Shimada Y. Kaji K. Hayashi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 1194-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), induce apoptosis in many cell types by both unique and common pathways (35Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C.

For example, Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor family members transduce the signal of apoptosis through death domain-containing molecules, such as FADD/MORT1 (37Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar), whereas many other apoptosis-inducing agents do not use molecules with a death domain. On the other hand, almost all known apoptosis-inducing agents share the activation of caspases (formerly called ICE family proteases) (35Hale A.J. Smith C.A. Sutherland L.C. Stoneman V.E.A. Longthorne V.L. Culhane A.C. Williams G.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 36Fraser A. Evan G.

Typically, caspase-1 (ICE) activates caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain/YAMA), which then cleaves death substrates such as PARP and lamins (37Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4559) Google Scholar). Ceramide accumulation has been proposed to be a common pathway of apoptosis; most apoptosis-inducing agents induce an accumulation of intrinsic ceramide and a concomitant decrease in sphingomyelin, a precursor of ceramide; C2-C8ceramides, which are membrane-permeable synthetic analogues of ceramide, activate caspases and induce apoptosis in many cells (35Hale A.J.

However, some of the increase in ceramide has been suggested to be a result rather than a cause of cell death (40Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 41Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the endothelial apoptosis induced by oxLDL. We found that ceramide generation, as well as caspase activation, is indispensable for the endothelial apoptosis induced by oxLDL and that some unique mechanisms are also involved in this process. The inhibitor for caspase-3 (CPP32/apopain), ac-DEVD-CHO, and the inhibitor for caspase-1 (interleukin-1β-converting enzyme), ac-YVAD-CHO, were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Cholesterol (5-cholesten-3β-ol), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholesten-3β,7β-diol), 25-hydroxycholesterol (5-cholesten-3β,25-diol), cholesterol-5α,6α-epoxide (5α,6α-epoxycholestan-3β-ol), 3β,5α,6β-trihydroxycholestane (cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol),l-lysophosphatidyl-choline palmitoyl (lysoPC), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (EC 1.15.1.1; bovine erythrocytes), and catalase (EC 1.11.1.6; bovine liver) were purchased from Sigma, and 7-keto-cholesterol (5-cholesten-3β-ol-7-one) was from Makor Chemical Ltd. (Jerusalem, Israel). C2-ceramide (N-acetylsphingosine) was from BIOMOL Research Laboratory (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (42Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6012) Google Scholar) were seeded at a density of 5 × 104/cm2and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Pepro Tech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for 24 h before the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 10 ng/ml bFGF, and various concentrations of oxLDL. The number of cells in this confluent culture did not change significantly in the serum-free medium for the next 48 h unless oxLDL was added. The cells were used for the experiments between passages 2 and 7. LDL (1.019 < d< 1.063) was prepared from normal human serum by sequential ultracentrifugation as described previously (43Havel R. Eder H. Braigon J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 39: 1345-1363Crossref Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Fifteen ml of DMEM was mixed with LDL (500 μg/ml) and Cu(II) sulfate (20 μm), and incubated with a confluent culture of HUVECs in a 15-cm dish at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity for 48 h. The medium was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min, sterilized with a 0.45 μm Millipore filter, and used as oxLDL. The incubation of LDL in DMEM without either HUVECs or Cu(II) sulfate did not cause significant oxidation of LDL. Acetylated LDL was prepared as reported previously (44Brown M. Goldstein J. Krieger M. Ho Y. Anderson R. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 597-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out under sterile conditions. The endotoxin was measured by a radioimmunoassay (Endospec SP test, Seikagaku-kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) and was under the detection limit in all native and oxLDL preparations. The oxidation of LDL was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis (Universal gel, Ciba Corning Diagnostic Corp., Alameda, CA) and by the measurement of thiobarbituric acid reacting substance (6Morel D.W. DiCorleto P.E. Chisolm G.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1984; 4: 357-364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). oxLDL had a thiobarbituric acid reacting substance value of 23.2 nmol of malondialdehyde/mg of protein (the mean ± S.E. of four separate preparations), whereas native and acetylated LDL each had no detectable thiobarbituric acid reacting substance. The oxLDL and acetylated LDL had 2–3-fold higherRf values on agarose gel electrophoresis compared with the native LDL. Gas chromatography (45Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. Lipids. 1993; 28: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) revealed that a typical preparation of ox LDL contained 4.0 μg of 7α-hydroxycholesterol/mg of LDL protein, 13.1 μg of epoxide/mg of LDL protein, 14.9 μg of 7-keto-cholesterol/mg of LDL protein, and 1.1 mg of unidentified oxycholesterol/mg of LDL protein. HUVECs were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in gelatin-coated 8-well chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) and cultured for 24 h before the medium was changed to DMEM containing 0.1% BSA, 10 ng/ml bFGF, and the indicated concentration of oxLDL. The cells were then cultured in the presence of oxLDL for the indicated periods, followed by fixation in 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and staining with a solution of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 500 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 10 min at room temperature (46Shimokado K. Umezawa K. Ogata J. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The number of apoptotic cells was counted in nine high power fields under a fluorescent microscope (approximately 1000–2000 cells/well). The percentage of apoptotic cells was calculated as the number of apoptotic cells/number of total cells × 100%. Each experiment was conducted in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Total lipid was extracted from oxLDL with chloroform/methanol and resolved by TLC (Silica gel 60, Merk, Darmstadt, Germany) using heptane/isopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4) as the developing solvent. Neutral lipids and phospholipids were extracted from the TLC with chloroform/methanol (1:1). The cellular ceramide content was measured by an Escherichia coli diacylgylcerol kinase assay (47Van Veldhoben P.P. Bishop W., R. Yurivich D., A. Bell R., M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 21-30PubMed Google Scholar, 48Masamune A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, total lipids were extracted from HUVECs (2 × 106 cells) by chloroform/methanol (1:1) and dried under N2 gas. The lipid was solubilized by sonication for 2 min into 20 μl of aqueous 7.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Dojindo), 5 mm cardiolipin (Sigma), and 1 mmdiethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). The solubilized lipid was mixed with 20 μl of reaction buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmEGTA, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0), 10 μl of 1 mg/mlE. coli diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem), 20 μl of 10 mm ATP (Sigma), and 5 μl of [-32P]ATP (111 TBq/mmol, DuPont). The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 40 min and then was stopped by the addition of 1 ml chloroform/methanol/1 n HCl (100:100:1, v/v), 340 μl of buffered saline solution, and 60 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The lower organic phase was dried under N2. Labeled ceramide was resolved by TLC using chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (10:4:2:2:1, v/v) as the developing solvent. The autoradiogram was analyzed by a Fuji Bas 2000 Bioimaging analyzer, and the ceramide content was determined with a standard curve of 0–1.7 nmol of ceramides (type III, Sigma). The ceramide content was standardized with total cellular phospholipid determined by a commercial kit (Wako Phospholipid Test, Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). Statistical analysis was conducted with Student's t test. Differences were considered significant when probability values less than 5% were obtained. oxLDL induced the apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). oxLDL induced significant apoptosis in HUVECs as early as at 12 h of incubation, and the number of apoptotic cells increased up until 48 h of incubation (Figs. 1 and2). Twelve to 18% of the HUVECs became apoptotic after 48 h incubation with 25 μg of protein/ml of oxLDL. This value is approximately the same as that obtained with the deprivation of both serum and bFGF (Fig. 2 A). At higher concentrations of oxLDL, the percentage of apoptotic cells decreased (Fig. 2 B), as did the total cell number (data not shown). After 72 h, the HUVECs became apoptotic regardless of the presence or absence of oxLDL, probably due to serum starvation, and the effect of oxLDL became less prominent (data not shown). Incubation with native LDL or acetylated LDL did not induce apoptosis beyond the control level (less than 5% of total cells) (data not shown). These findings indicated that oxLDL induces apoptosis in cultured human endothelial cells.Figure 2Time- and dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in HUVECs by oxLDL. A, time dependence. HUVECs were seeded as described in the legend to Fig. 1, and cultured in the presence (▪) or absence (▴) of oxLDL (25 μg of protein/ml) for the indicated periods. As a positive control (○), cells were cultured in the absence of bFGF. The number of apoptotic cells was counted in nine high power fields under a fluorescent microscope. Each point represents the mean ± S.E. of quintuple samples for the negative control and oxLDL groups and of quadruplicate samples for the positive control. B, dose dependence.

To examine whether the apoptotic activity of oxLDL is also due to the lipid fractions, oxLDL was extracted with organic solvent, and neutral lipids and phospholipids were separated by TLC. All of the apoptosis-inducing activity of oxLDL was recovered in the total lipid fraction (Table I). More than 90% of the activity was recovered in the neutral lipid fraction, and no significant activity was recovered in the phospholipid fraction. Gas chromatography revealed that the major components of the neutral lipid fraction generated in oxLDL were a series of oxysterols, such as 7-ketocholesterol and 7-hydroxycholesterol (see preparation of modified LDL under “Experimental Procedures”). We therefore investigated the apoptosis-inducing activity of various oxysterols found in oxLDL. All oxysterols examined induced apoptosis, to various degrees; significant apoptosis was induced by 5 μg/ml 7-keto-cholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or triol and by 20 μg/ml 7-hydroxycholesterol or epoxide (Table II). Oxysterol tended to induce apoptosis to a greater degree compared with oxLDL. Cholesterol did not induce apoptosis at 20 μg/ml. LysoPC did not induce significant endothelial apoptosis (Table II). These data suggest that neutral lipids, such as oxysterols, are responsible for the apoptosis-inducing activity of oxLDL.Table IApoptosis-inducing activity of various lipid fractions of oxLDLFractionApoptosis (% of total cells)Apoptosis (% of control)Control4.3 ± 0.60oxLDL16.0 ± 1.4100Total lipids17.4 ± 1.3120Neutral lipids14.8 ± 0.493Phospholipids6.0 ± 0.515 Open table in a new tab Table IIOxysterols induce apoptosis in HUVECsSterolConcentrationApoptosisS.E.P versuscontrolμg/ml% of total cellsControl2.450.27Cholesterol5.02.380.54NS20.02.450.33NS7β-OH-0.52.490.51NS chloesterol5.02.710.63NS20.09.742.63<0.017-Keto-0.56.040.90<0.02 chlolesterol1.07.221.22<0.025.06.811.33<0.0120.076.314.0<0.001Epoxide0.52.010.41NS5.01.790.37NS20.08.792.45<0.0525-OH-0.53.600.60NS cholesterol1.04.230.18<0.0012.56.550.47<0.0015.020.74.52<0.00520.063.77.70<0.001Triol0.52.270.37NS5.023.79.17<0.0520.085.71.47<0.001LysoPC5.02.44.6NS Open table in a new tab Although ceramide has been implicated in the apoptosis induced by a variety of agents, its precise role is still controversial (35Hale A.J.

Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether ceramide was involved in oxLDL-induced apoptosis. First, we examined whether oxLDL affected the cellular ceramide content. Ceramides were detected as two major spots on TLC, as reported previously (Fig. 3 A) (48Masamune A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). oxLDL (0–50 μg/ml) increased the cellular ceramide transiently at 15 min in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3). After 24 h of oxLDL treatment, the cellular ceramide increased again to a similar extent (data not shown). An oxysterol, 7-keto-cholesterol (5 μg/ml), also stimulated ceramide generation at 15 min (3.2-fold increase; average of two independent experiments). Second, we studied whether the inhibition of ceramide generation prevented endothelial apoptosis. Two different inhibitors of sphingomyelinase, desipramine and chlorpromazine (51Masson M. Spezzatti B. Chapman J. Battisti C. Baumann N. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), inhibited the oxLDL-induced apoptosis completely (Fig. 4 A). At the same concentration, these inhibitors inhibited the ceramide generation induced by oxLDL (Fig. 4 B). Third, we studied whether exogenous ceramide induced apoptosis in our experimental conditions. In accordance with a previous report with exogenous C6-ceramide (52Slowik M.R. De Luca L.G. Min W. Pober J.S. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 736-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), C2-ceramide, a membrane-permeable form of ceramide, induced endothelial apoptosis (Table III). These findings demonstrated that the increase in cellular ceramide is indispensable for the induction of endothelial apoptosis by oxLDL.Figure 4Effect of sphingomyelinase inhibitors on ceramide generation and apoptosis. A sphingomyelinase inhibitor was added to the culture 22 h after seeding. After 2 h, the medium was changed to DMEM supplemented with 0.1% BSA, 10 ng/ml bFGF, oxLDL (25 μg of protein/ml), and the inhibitor. The percentage of apoptotic cells (A) was determined after 48 h, and ceramide content (B) was determined at 15 min.

We have previously reported that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induces the activation of Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways through glycoprotein (gp) 130 in cardiac myocytes. However, whether PI 3-kinase is involved in regulation of gp130 signaling and the activation mechanisms by which it associates with other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins remain unknown. We found that LIF induced the activation of PI 3-kinase in cardiac myocytes. Moreover, JAK1 binds to PI 3-kinase, and LIF stimulation increases the PI 3-kinase activity in JAK1 immunoprecipitates. Activation of MAP kinase and protein kinase B by LIF was attenuated by wortmannin. LIF-induced p70 S6 kinase activation, protein synthesis, and c-fos mRNA expression were inhibited by wortmannin and rapamycin. Both inhibitors failed to appreciably affect the phosphorylation of STAT3. In conclusion, PI 3-kinase is activated with LIF in cardiac myocytes, and JAK1 is found to associate with this enzyme.

We have recently demonstrated that JAK signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways are present at downstream of gp130 in cardiac myocytes and are rapidly activated by LIF both in vivo and in vitro (12Kunisada K.

Activation of cell proliferation by several different cytokines has been shown to correlate with the intracellular activation of common protein kinase cascades. This may be explained by the functional pleiotropy and redundancy of cytokine receptor systems (13Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is very intriguing that growth factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor and angiotensin II) and cytokines work through the JAK/Tyk and MAP kinases and lead to the activation of the same or different sets of signal transduction pathways. It is generally accepted that the tyrosine kinases of growth factor receptors and oncogene products specifically associate with phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (14Cantley L.C. Auger K.R.

These products of PI 3-kinase act on multiple downstream effectors that interact with Src homology-2 (SH2) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases. Recent studies revealed that PI 3-kinase plays an important role in the activation of p70 S6 kinase (18Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and the prevention of apoptosis (23Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of PI 3-kinase in LIF-induced hypertrophic and cytoprotective signals in cardiac myocytes. A specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, wortmannin, inhibited the LIF-induced activation of MAP kinase, protein kinase B (PKB), p70 S6 kinase, protein synthesis, and c-fos mRNA expression in cardiac myocytes. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that JAK1 protein kinase may be the protein associated with PI 3-kinase after LIF stimulation, although wortmannin did not affect the phosphorylation of STAT3. Therefore, our study suggests that maximal stimulation of the protein kinase cascade by LIF requires the activation of PI 3-kinase, which may be an important mediator of LIF-induced signal transduction in cardiac myocytes. Recombinant mouse LIF, antibody to PI 3-kinase, PKB, anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10), Crosstide (substrate peptide for PKB), and p70 S6 kinase kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Antibodies to JAK1, p70 S6 kinase, and STAT3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc, Santa Cruz, CA. The MAP kinase assay kit, [γ-32P]ATP, protein A/G-Sepharose, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system were purchased from Amersham International plc., Oakville, Ontario, Canada. [3H]Leucine was obtained from ICN. Wortmannin, rapamycin, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate were purchased from Sigma. Wortmannin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to 1 mmstocks, stored at −20 °C, and diluted in medium immediately before use. Rapamycin was dissolved as stock solution in ethanol. PD098059 were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA. Phosphatidylinositol was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL. Medium-199 (M-199; Flow Laboratories, Inc.) and newborn bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for cell culture. All other chemicals were reagents of molecular biology grade and were obtained from standard commercial sources. Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were prepared from the ventricles of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats (Nippon Dobutsu, Japan) as described previously (24Yamauchi-Takihara K. Ihara Y. Ogata A. Yoshizaki K. Azuma J. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1520-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). After an enzymatic dissociation, the cells were preplated for 1 h to selectively enrich for cardiac myocytes. The resultant suspension of myocytes were plated onto 35- or 60-mm culture dishes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2 and cultured in M-199 supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum and 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine. The medium was changed to M-199 and 10% newborn bovine serum 24 h after seeding. We obtained >90% myocytes in cultures prepared with this procedure. Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C and were generally used for the experiments 4 days after seeding. The medium was changed to M-199 24 h before the experiments. Cardiac myocytes seeded in 24-well plates were stimulated with LIF (103 units/ml) in serum-free medium containing 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine. After 24 h, the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 30 min with cold 5% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate protein. The cells were then washed once with trichloroacetic acid and three times in tap water. The radioactivity incorporated into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction was measured by liquid scintillation counting after solubilization in 0.1 m NaOH. The results were expressed as counts per minute per dish. Reactions and lipid extraction were essentially performed according to the method of Whitman et al. (25Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B.

The immunoprecipitates were subjected to the assay in a 50-μl reaction mixture (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 120 μm adenosine, 50 μm ATP). Phosphatidylinositol sonicated in chloroform was added to the reaction at a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and vortexed before incubation at 30 °C for 10 min. Wortmannin was added to the pellet in various concentrations and samples were preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Phospholipids were immediately extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v). Equal volume aliquots from the bottom organic phase were spotted onto thin layer chromatography (TLC) Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck), developing solvent for 2 h, and visualized by autoradiography. Assays of MAP kinase activity were performed as described previously (27Ferby I.M. Waga I. Sakanaka C. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30485-30488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were lysed at 4 °C in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min. The concentrations of total protein in the supernatant were measured using protein assay system (Bio-Rad). Total cell lysates (1 μg of protein/reaction) were incubated in 0.7 mg/ml synthetic peptide substrate containing the phosphorylation sequence PLS/TP in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP). The reactions were initiated by adding 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP to the mixture. After a 30-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of stop solution. Aliquots of the supernatants (30 μl) were spotted onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman International Ltd.), washed twice with 60 mm H3PO4 for 2 min, and twice with distilled water for 2 min, dried, and counted by the Cerenkov technique. Cardiac myocytes were harvested with 200 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The extracted proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Co.). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoblots were incubated with antibody at 1:500 dilution (for p70 S6 kinase), 1:2500 dilution (for STAT3) for 1 h followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000 dilution) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed on ice in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations for STAT3 were performed as described previously (12Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). After 20 min, lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm, and the postnuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with 0.3 μg/ml p70 S6 kinase antiserum for 2 h before addition of 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (20 mmMOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mmdithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm S6 kinase substrate peptide (AKRRRLSSLRA) and 2 μm protein kinase inhibitor peptide. The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 40 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2 mixture and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP mixture. After a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, 20 μl of the reaction was spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper and washed twice in 0.75% phosphoric acid and twice in acetone. The dried papers were placed in 5 ml of scintillant and counted by the Cerenkov technique. PKB kinase assay was performed according to the method previously described by Cross et al. (28Cross D.A.E.

To immunoprecipitate endogenous PKB, 1 μg of anti-PKB antibody coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads were used. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, twice in washing buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.03% (w/v) Brij-35, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol), and once in kinase assay buffer. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay, buffer containing 30 μm Crosstide, and 17 μmprotein kinase A inhibitor peptide. The kinase reaction was processed as for p70 S6 kinase assays, and the radioactivity associated to the P-81 phosphocellulose paper was counted. Isolation of total cellular RNA was performed by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). Northern blot was performed as described previously (24Yamauchi-Takihara K. Ihara Y. Ogata A. Yoshizaki K. Azuma J.

The relative amounts of specific mRNA were visualized by autoradiography. The hybridization signals of mRNA were normalized to those of human β-actin mRNA. Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's t test as appropriate. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. Several cell line studies indicated that PI 3-kinase plays an important role in the cellular responses to various cytokines (15Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M. Harris A.N. Knowlton K.U. Glembotski C.C.

To investigate the involvement of PI 3-kinase in gp130 signaling, we examined PI 3-kinase activity in cultured cardiac myocytes after LIF (103 units/ml) stimulation. We found that treatment of cardiac myocytes with LIF caused a substantial increase in the PI 3-kinase activity that immunoprecipitated with either anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-PI 3-kinase antibody (Fig. 1 A, upper panel). The kinase activity presented a rapid increase at 10 min and declined at 60 min in both immunoprecipitates. Subsequent Western blot analysis with anti-PI 3-kinase antibody were performed to verify the same amount of p85 in all samples (Fig. 1 A, middle panel). Quantitation of PI 3-kinase activity obtained by densitometric analysis of autoradiograms were summarized in the lower panel. To determine whether PI 3-kinase is a critical functional component of LIF-initiated signaling, we used the PI 3-kinase specific inhibitor, wortmannin, in this system to confirm the specificity of this activity to PI 3-kinase (31Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 min of LIF stimulation, cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated by anti-PI 3-kinase antibody and wortmannin was added to the pellet at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 1 B. Wortmannin reduced the LIF-induced activation of PI 3-kinase to 50% of the maximum at a concentration of 1 nmand completely abrogated the activity at a concentration of 100 nm. We next examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase after 10 min of LIF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 2 (upper panel), stimulation of cardiac myocytes with LIF markedly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. Similar amounts of protein were detected with anti-PI 3-kinase antibodies, showing that equivalent amounts of p85 were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2, lower panel). To examine whether p70 S6 kinase is activated by LIF, p70 S6 kinase mobility shift and immunocomplex assays were performed. Fig. 3 (upper panel) shows a time course of p70 S6 kinase activation after LIF stimulation. Treatment of the cells with LIF for 15 min caused a large increase in the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (αI and αII), which was accompanied by the slowest migration in electrophoretic mobility. Western blot analysis with anti-JAK1 antibody was used to normalize the levels of p70 S6 kinase in all samples (Fig. 3, middle panel). To further analyze the changes in the phosphorylation state of p70 S6 kinase, immunocomplex assay was performed with S6 peptide used as a substrate. The kinase assay was performed after immunoprecipitation with an anti-p70 S6 kinase antibody to eliminate other kinases that phosphorylate p70 S6 kinase. We confirmed that LIF activates p70 S6 kinase, which results in a 2.8-fold increase in phosphorylation of the S6 peptide at 15 min (Fig. 3, lower panel). We next examined the effects of rapamycin on LIF-induced p70 S6 kinase activation. Cardiac myocytes were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of rapamycin for 30 min, and p70 S6 kinase mobility shift assays were performed after 15 min of LIF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4 A(upper panel), p70 S6 kinase was rapidly dephosphorylated in the presence of 3 ng/ml rapamycin, and the inhibitory effects occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Several studies using the selective inhibitor wortmannin indicated that PI 3-kinase acts upstream of p70 S6 kinase in a signaling cascade induced by a number of tyrosine kinase receptors (18Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 32Wilson M. Burt A.R. Milligan G. Anderson N.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To support our hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is coupled to the p70 S6 kinase signaling cascade in cardiac myocytes, we used wortmannin in the assay. Pretreatment of cardiac myocytes with 100 nm wortmannin for 15 min led to complete inactivation of p70 S6 kinase (Fig. 4 A, upper panel, lane 3). This inhibitory effect of wortmannin occurred in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B, upper panel, lanes 4–6). Subsequent Western blot analysis with anti-JAK1 antibody were performed to verify the same amount of p70 S6 kinase in all samples (Fig. 4, A and B, middle panel). These results correlated well with inactivation of kinase activities (Fig. 4,A and B, lower panel). We showed that LIF treatment caused a 2.1-fold increase in [3H]leucine incorporation over 24 h (Fig. 5,lane 4). We next tested the effects of wortmannin and rapamycin on protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5, wortmannin (100 nm) and rapamycin (3 ng/ml) do not simply suppress the basal level of [3H]leucine incorporation (lanes 2 and 3, respectively) but specifically inhibit LIF-stimulated protein synthesis. Preincubation with wortmannin for 15 min completely inhibited LIF-stimulated increase in [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 5, lane 5). To determine whether the increase in protein synthesis was mediated via p70 S6 kinase, cardiac myocytes were preincubated with rapamycin for 30 min before LIF stimulation. Rapamycin significantly suppressed LIF-induced [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 5, lane 6). To investigate the involvement of PI 3-kinase in LIF induced MAP kinase activation in cardiac myocytes, we examined the effects of wortmannin on MAP kinase activity. MAP kinase activity was not affected by wortmannin nor rapamycin in the vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 6, lanes 2 and 3). It was significantly augmented 5 min after LIF stimulation (Fig. 6,lane 4). When cardiac myocytes were pretreated with wortmannin at a dose of 100 nm for 15 min, activation of MAP kinase induced by LIF was inhibited by 50% as compared with the kinase activity without pretreatment (Fig. 6, lane 5). We next examined whether rapamycin and PKC down-regulation would influence the activation of MAP kinase induced by LIF. The cells were pretreated with 3 ng/ml rapamycin for 30 min and 5 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h, respectively, before LIF stimulation. Activation of MAP kinase achieved with LIF was affected neither by rapamycin nor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pretreatment (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7). We have previously reported that LIF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2 within 15 min in cardiac myocytes (12Kunisada K. Hirota H. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Tani Y. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2626-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible relationship between JAK protein kinase and PI 3-kinase. Cell lysates from cardiac myocytes were immunoprecipitated with antibody to JAK1 and analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody to the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase. We showed that PI 3-kinase was co-immunoprecipitated, but there was no significant increase in the amount of PI 3-kinase protein after 15 min LIF stimulation (Fig. 7 A). These results indicate that these associations do not directly enhance the kinase activity induced by LIF. The specificity of the antibody used for immunoblotting was verified by preincubation of the antibody with an excess amount of peptide antigen, which eliminated the signal (Fig. 7 A, preabsorbed). The immunoblots were reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-JAK1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7 B, tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1 immunoprecipitates was only observed after LIF stimulation (upper panels). We also confirmed that the same amount of proteins were immunoprecipitated in each sample (Fig. 7 B, lower panels). To investigate whether the PI 3-kinase which co-immunoprecipitated with JAK1 remains active, anti-JAK1 immunoprecipitates were analyzed for PI 3-kinase activity. We observed that LIF stimulation induced increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with JAK1, which completely inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 7 C). We next examined the involvement of PI 3-kinase, p70 S6 kinase, MAP kinase in the downstream signaling events of JAKs by studying the status of STAT3 activation under the conditions of wortmannin, rapamycin, and MEK inhibitor PD098059 pretreatment. As shown in Fig. 8 A, LIF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 within 5 min in cardiac myocytes. But interestingly, neither wortmannin nor rapamycin affected the LIF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation STAT3. In addition, there was a discernible reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT3α, which is phosphorylated on serine after 10 min LIF stimulation, and then declined to basal level at 60 min (Fig. 8 B, lanes 2 a"
https://openalex.org/W2107564406,"Our laboratory has reported that two major noncollagenous dentin proteins, dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein, are specific cleavage products of a larger precursor protein termed dentin sialophosphoprotein (MacDougall, M., Simmons, D., Luan, X., Nydegger, J., Feng, J. Q., and Gu, T. T. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272:835–842). To confirm our single gene hypothesis and initiate in vitropromoter studies, we have characterized the structural organization of the mouse dentin sialophosphoprotein gene. This gene has a transcription unit of ∼9.4 kilobase pairs and is organized into 5 exons and 4 introns. Exon 1 contains a noncoding 5′ sequence, and exon 2 contains the transcriptional start site, signal peptide, and first two amino acids of the NH2 terminus. Exons 3 and 4 contain coding information for 29 and 314 amino acids, respectively. The remainder of the coding information and the untranslated 3′ region are contained in exon 5. Chromosomal mapping localized the gene to mouse chromosome 5q21 in close proximity to other dentin/bone matrix genes. Computer analysis of the promoter proximal 1.6-kilobase pair sequence revealed a number of potentially important cis-regulatory sequences; these include the recognition elements of AP-1, AP-2, Msx-1, serum response elements, SP-1, and TCF-1. In vitro studies showed that the DSPP promoter is active in an odontoblast cell line, MO6-G3, with basal activity mapped to −95 bp. Two potential enhancer and suppresser elements were identified in the regions between −1447 and −791 bp and −791 and −95 bp, respectively. The structural organization of the dentin sialophosphoprotein gene confirms our finding that both dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein are encoded by a single gene with a continuous open reading frame.

The dentin extracellular matrix (DECM) 1The abbreviations used are: DECM, dentin extracellular matrix; DMP1, dentin matrix protein 1; DPP, dentin phosphoprotein; DSP, dentin sialoprotein; DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SPP1, secreted phosphoprotein 1; LUC, luciferase; bp, base pair; kbp, kilobase pair. is the result of the cytodifferentiation of cranial neural crest-derived ectomesenchymal cells that line the tooth pulp chamber into highly specialized cells termed odontoblasts. These odontoblasts express specific genes products which form the collagenous DECM. This matrix consists of mostly type I (∼86%), type I trimer, type III, type V, and type VI collagens and several noncollagenous proteins also found in bone extracellular matrix, such as osteonectin (OSN, also known as SPARC), osteocalcin, osteopontin (OPN, also known as SSP1), bone sialoprotein, and dentin matrix protein 1 (Dmp-1) (1Linde A.

However, two DECM proteins, dentin sialoprotein (DSP) and dentin phosphoprotein (DPP, also known as phosphophoryn), have been shown to be tooth specific (for review Ref.1Linde A. Goldberg M. Crit.

These noncollagenous DECM proteins are believed to be essential for initiation and control of mineralization in the transition of predentin to dentin. DSP was first identified as a 95-kDa glycoprotein (11Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Linde A. Coll. Relat. Res. 1981; 1: 187-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with a high carbohydrate (30%) and sialic acid (10%) content accounting for 5–8% of the DECM proteins. This protein has an overall resemblance to other sialoproteins like bone sialoprotein and shares limited NH2-terminal sequence homology with other acidic phosphoproteins, OPN, Dmp-1, and bone acidic glycoprotein-75. A rat full-length cDNA DSP clone (1.2 kbp) has been reported coding for a 366-residue secreted protein with a 17-amino acid signal peptide. The calculated amino acid composition for the predicted protein was extremely close to that determined for the matrix isolated protein (5Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, two different sized genomic rat DSP clones have been isolated with one being fully characterized (5Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3698-3702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Ritchie H. Pinero G.L. Hou H. Butler W.T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two DSP polypeptide bands were identified by Western blot with a polyclonal DSP antibody, suggesting that more than a single DSP protein may exist (2Butler W.T. Ritchie H.H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar). DPP is the major noncollagenous dentin matrix protein which is strongly associated with the mineralization of dentin. In vivo (13Weinstock M. Leblond C.P. J. Cell Biol. 1973; 56: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and in vitro (14Dimuzio M.T. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6845-6852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Munksgaard E.C. Richardson W.S. Butler W.T. Arch. Oral Biol. 1978; 23: 583-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) data have shown that DPP is expressed by the odontoblasts and preameloblasts. After secretion, DPP is confined to the mineralized dentin layer of the matrix (3MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Gorter de Vries I. Wisse E. Arch. Oral. Biol. 1989; 31: 57-66Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Molecular masses of DPP in numerous species have been reported: 155 kDa in bovines (7Stetler-Stevenson W. Veis A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4326-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), 72 kDa in mice (3MacDougall M. Zeichner-David M. Slavkin H.C. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and 90–95 kDa in rats (10Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Cothran W.C. Linde A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Sabsay B. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Lechner J.H. Veis A. Biochem J. 1991; 276: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The number of DPP proteins within the DECM has also varied with multiple forms being reported for rats (2Butler W.T. Ritchie H.H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar, 10Butler W.T. Bhown M. Dimuzio M.T. Cothran W.C. Linde A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 178-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although the exact molecular size and number of DPPs is unclear, conserved high levels of aspartic acid (30–40%) and phosphoserine (38–50%) in all reported species suggest a function related to dentin mineralization. It is believed that DPP is a nucleator or modulator of hydroxyapatite crystal formation (1Linde A. Goldberg M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1993; 4: 679-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Recently, our laboratory has reported the identification and characterization of a mouse 4.4-kbp cDNA clone which is homologous to DSP on its 5′ region and to DPP on its 3′ terminal with a single continuous open reading frame (18MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We named this gene dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) and mapped it to human chromosome 4 which contains the gene loci for the dentin diseases dentinogenesis imperfecta type II and dentin dysplasia type II. We proposed that DPP and DSP represent specific cleavage products of a large chimeric precursor protein which is processed. In contrast, Ritchie and Wang (19Ritchie H.H. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have identified an additional open reading frame for rat DPP in a partial 2.0-kbp PCR-generated DSP cDNA clone. These authors suggest that the presence of both DSP and DPP was possibly due to an artifact generated by reverse transcription-PCR or cloning, or caused by a bicistronic gene. In addition, a partial COOH-terminal rat phosphophoryn (DPP) cDNA clone has been reported at the amino acid level only, named dentin matrix protein 2 (Dmp2), which has high homology to the COOH terminus of both the mouse DSPP and rat DPP deduced amino acid sequences (20George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Little is known regarding the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in DSPP gene expression and the nature of the extrinsic or intrinsic factors that regulate it. With the objective of clarifying the single gene hypothesis, deciphering the basic structural organization, and regulation of the DSPPgene, we isolated mouse DSPP genomic clones. A 19-kbp clone containing the entire mouse DSPP gene was characterized in detail. Furthermore, we localized the transcriptional start site by a primer extension assay and determined the mouse chromosomal location by genetic mapping. Computer analysis was performed on the upstream DSPP promoter region to identify a number of potential regulatorycis-acting elements. Finally, the promoter activity of various constructs was assayed in vitro using an odontoblast cell line previously shown to express both DSP and DPP, with basal promoter activity mapped to −95 bp. Our data confirm that DPP and DSP are encoded by a single gene with a continuous open reading frame. A mouse genomic lambda Fix II 129/SVJ library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened using a mouse DSPP full length (4.4-kbp) clone or a partial PCR-generated DSPP611–1089 cDNA which was directionally subcloned into pGEM-5Z+ (Promega, Madison, WI). The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit from Boehringer Mannheim according to supplier's instructions. Plaque lift filters were hybridized overnight in hybridization buffer containing 6 ×SSC (1 ×SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm, 10 μg/ml poly(A)+, and 10 μg/ml tRNA at 68 °C. The filters were washed at 55 °C for 20 min, twice in 2 ×SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer, and once in 0.5 ×SSC, 0.1% SDS buffer. The isolated phage DNA clones were mapped by restriction enzyme analysis according to standard procedures (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA inserts from positive DSPP clones were cut with restriction enzymes (EcoRI, SacI,BamHI, XhoI, and XmnI), and fragments were subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene). The DNA sequence in both directions was determined with an ABI automatic sequencer model 372 (Applied Biosystems). Protein consensus sequences and DNA sequence alignment diagonal matrix plots were determined using MacVector 6.0 software (Kodak, Rochester, NY). The percentage of DNA sequence homology was determined using GenePro 6.1 software (Riverside Scientific Enterprises, Beinbridge Island, WA). The transcriptional start site was mapped by primer extension using a synthetic oligonucleotide, DSPP54–375′-CGAGGG GACTTTGAAAAT-3′ (Primer 2, Fig. 2 C), in the exon 1 sequence. Total RNA was isolated from the odontoblast cell line, previously shown to express DSPP (both DSP and DPP) (22MacDougall M. Thiemann F. Ta H. Hsu P. Chen L.S. Snead M. Connect.

The primer extension assay was carried out using the primer extension kit from Promega according to instructions with annealing reactions carried out at 55 °C. Resulting products were electrophoresed on a 8% denaturing urea polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. The primer DNA sequences were used for size markers.Figure 2DNA sequence of the mouse DSPPgene and 5′ promoter region.

D5Mit9 (Chr 5 DNA marker, MIT-9) was typed using the primers and conditions described by Dietrich et al. (27Dietrich W. Katz H. Lincoln S.E. Shin H.-S. Friedman J. Dracopoli N.C. Lander E.S. Genetics. 1992; 131: 423-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The partial DSPP cDNA probe was labeled as described previously. Linkage was determined using the program LOCUS designed by C. E. Buckler (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The percent recombination and standard errors were determined according to the method of Green (28Green E.L. Genetics and Probability in Animal Breeding Experiments. Oxford University Press, New York1981Crossref Google Scholar), and the gene order was determined by minimizing recombinants. Since no appropriate restriction enzyme sites existed within exon 1 of the mouseDSPP gene, a PCR-amplified product, corresponding to the sequence between nucleotides −1447 and +54 of exon 1, was generated with a set of synthesized primers: DSPP 1-S−1447–1430 (5′-GAATTCTAGGACAAGCAG-3′), and DSPP 2-AS37–54 (5′-CGAGGGGACTT TGAAAAT-3′). The PCR reaction was 3 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle, 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 35 cycles followed by 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified 1.5-kbp fragment was first cloned into the pCRII vector using TA cloning kit (InVitrogen, San Diego, CA) and then released with HindIII on the 3′ side and various restriction enzymes on the 5′ side to produce the 5 different constructs, and recloned into pGL3 luciferase (LUC) basic expression vector (Promega). Correct orientation of the all inserts with respect to the pGL3 LUC vector was verified by DNA sequencing. The pGL3 LUC−1447-+54-kbp plasmid consisted of pGL3 LUC vector with a 1.5-kbp EcoRI and HindIII fragment of the DSPP gene. The pGL3LUC−1243-+54 plasmid was similarly generated from a 1.3-kbpBglII and HindIII fragment, the pGL3LUC−791-+54 plasmid from an 845-bp XhoI and HindIII fragment, the pGL3LUC−510-+54 plasmid from a 650-bp XmnI and HindIII fragment, and the pGL3LUC−95-+54-bp plasmid from a 149-bp BamHI and HindIII fragment. All the various plasmid constructs contained part of the exon 1 noncoding region. An established odontoblast cell line MO6-G3 (20George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A.

After electroporation (320 V; capacitance, 960 mFD), the cells were divided into aliquots, replated in a 6-well plate, and cultured for 72 h in α-minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.)(29Feng J.Q. Chen D. Cooney A.J. Tsai M.-J. Harris M.A. Tsai S.Y. Feng M. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28364-28373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were assayed for dual luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's procedure (Promega). In this dual luciferase system, DSPP promoter fragments were linked to the firefly luciferase gene while the co-transfected renilla luciferase gene was driven by the SV40 promoter. The second reporter gene provided an internal control by which each value within an experimental set could be normalized. Since both enzymes used different substrates, dual luciferase measurements were performed using TD-20/20 (Promega) in a single tube, with firefly luciferase assayed first followed by renilla luciferase. The promoter activity was reflected by the ratio of firefly/renilla luciferase for each construct. Seven clones were isolated from 2 × 106 plaques of mouse 129/SVJ genomic library using mouse DSPP cDNA probes (18MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). These overlapping clones spanned 35 kbp of the Dspp locus (Fig. 1). One 19-kbp clone (λ1) contained 5 exons, 4 introns, and ∼1.6-kbp 5′- and ∼8-kbp 3′-flanking regions. This clone was utilized for the characterization of the DSPPgene. A diagram of the λ1 clone with exon organization is shown in Fig. 1. The ∼9.4-kbp transcription unit and ∼1.6 kbp of the 5′-flanking region were sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of mouse DSPP and deduced amino acid sequence of coding exons (934 residues) are shown in Fig. 2 A. Full DNA sequence of the intron regions can be found in the Genbank/EMBL Data Bank submission. DNA sequence of the coding and untranslated regions of DSPP are identical with those of the mouse DSPP cDNA except for a single T initially reported as a G in the cDNA sequence at nucleotide 2888 (18MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). This nucleotide change results in the shortening of the coding region by 6 amino acids (18MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the DNA sequence of 1628 bp of the 5′-flanking region and candidate DNA response elements located upstream of the first exon. Oligonucleotide primers used in the primer extension experiments and promoter constructs are also indicated in Fig. 2. As shown in Table I, the conserved 5′-dinucleotide sequence GT is contained in all four introns of mouse DSPP gene. All AG− consensus dinucleotide sequences on 5′ donor regions are conserved except in exon 2 which has the sequence CG. These dinucleotide sequences are putative splice sites implicated in the primary transcript splicing (30Breathnch R. Benoist D. O'Hare K. Gannon F. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab Primer extension analysis was performed to map the mouse DSPP gene transcription start site. Total RNA from a stable, previously characterized mouse odontoblast cell line, MO6-G3, and a DSPP 254–37 primer (Fig. 2 B) corresponding to nucleotides in exon 1 were used for this assay. As shown in Fig. 3, a clear extended fragment was obtained with the odontoblast-derived RNA but not with tRNA. Based on this 54-bp extended band, the size of exon 1 is estimated as 67 bp which is in agreement with the size of the longest mouse DSPP cDNA clone isolated (18MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). DNA sequence homology diagonal plots between the mouse DSPP gene, rat DSP cDNA (5Ritchie H.H. Hou H. Veis A. Butler W.T. J. Biol.

Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and rat DPP cDNA (19Ritchie H.H. Wang L.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21695-21698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using MacVector software are shown in Fig. 4. These data show (Fig. 4, A and B) diagonal lines as expected when sequences are aligned throughout the sequence. It is clear that the DNA sequence of rat DSP clone is homologous (>80%) to mouseDSPP gene exons 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the most 5′-portion of exon 5 (Fig. 4, A and C). The rat DPP is similar (∼70% homology) to the remainder of the mouse DSPP gene exon 5 (Fig. 4, B and C). In the plot against the rat DPP clone (Fig. 4 B), numerous diagonal lines occur off the central line, appearing as a black box, due to the region of extensive internal homology (repetitive serine-aspartic acid region) within DPP. These data confirm that DSP and DPP are encoded from a single gene. The mouse locus Dspp was mapped using a 479 bp cDNA fragment as a hybridization probe to type DNAs from two sets of genetic crosses. HpaI digestion generated fragments of 25 kbp in NFS/N and C58/J and 14.5 kbp inM. m. musculus. HindIII digestion produced fragments of 7.4 kbp in NFS/N and C58/J and 7.0 in M. spretus.Inheritance of the polymorphic fragments was followed in the progeny of both crosses and compared with that of >1000 markers previously typed and mapped. Dspp was linked to markers on chromosome 5 and mapped between Afp and Pdeb as shown in Fig. 5. In the Afp-Dspp interval, 13 recombinants were identified of which 11 were also typed for D9Mit9. Only 2 of these recombinants were recombinant with Dspp, suggesting the D5Mit9can be placed 1.4 cM proximal to Dspp. The closest linkage was observed between Dspp and Ibsp with no recombinants identified in 159 mice, and between Dspp and Spp1 with no recombinants in 103 mice, indicating that at the upper limit of the 95% confidence level, Dspp is within 1.87 cM of Ibsp and 2.87 cM of Spp1. The mouseDSPP gene contains no TATA box in the region adjacent to the transcription start site but does contain a GC-rich stretch of 22 nucleotides that lies between −143 and −165 (Fig. 2 B). A perfect SP1 binding site GGGCG is located in this region. It is believed that genes lacking the TATA box may rely on these GC-rich sites and that proteins bound to them to initiate transcription. There are six potential binding sites for the Msx-1 homeobox gene. Recent data have shown that Msx-1 is essential for tooth development, since the gene knockout results in an arrest of molar development (31Satokata I. Maas R. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both Msx-1 (32Janknecht R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4219-4224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and the DSPP contain four TCF-1 binding sites, suggesting potential regulation by members of the ets family of transcriptional factors (33Kuzuoka M. Takahashi T. Guron C. Raghow R. Genomics. 1994; 21: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Four potential serum response elements in the promoter region may indicate possible regulation of DSPPby growth factors identified in serum, such as platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor. An established mouse odontoblast cell line was selected for analysis of mouse DSPP promoter activity, since both DSP and DPP have been shown at the transcriptional and translational levels to be expressed by odontoblasts using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry (22MacDougall M. Thiemann F. Ta H. Hsu P. Chen L.S. Snead M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 33: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 72 h of transfection with the five DSPP-luciferase reporter gene constructs (Fig. 5 A), the cells were harvested and the luciferase activity was determined. As indicated in Fig. 5 B, pGL3−791-+54 plasmid had the lowest luciferase activity while pGL3−95-+54 plasmid had the highest activity. This initial analysis of the promoter activity suggests that potential transcriptional or translational enhancers exist in the region between −1447 and −791. Also, the data suggest that potential suppressor elements are located in the region between −791 and −95 bp, since the promoter activity is increased more than 2-fold after removal of this region. In addition, strong promoter activity of the −95-bp fragment indicates that this fragment may contain the basal control elements for expression of DSPP. In this st"

The level of the active GTP-bound form is regulated by its own GDI, GEF, and GAP. The interconversion between the GTP-bound and GDP-bound forms allows Rho to act as a molecular switch that regulates intercellular signaling pathways. Rho is implicated in the cytoskeletal responses to extracellular signals including lysophosphatidic acid and certain growth factors, which result in the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion (5Machesky L.M.

These proteins contain the MBS made up of myosin phosphatase and a novel serine/threonine kinase, Rho-kinase, that has been shown to phosphorylate MBS to inactivate myosin phosphatase and also to phosphorylate the MLC. Accumulation of phosphorylated MLC induces a conformational change in myosin II that increases its interaction with actin and enables the formation of myosin filaments (12Tan J.L. Ravid S.

Rho has two related small GTPases, Rac and Cdc42, that are also involved in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, whereas the cell morphological effects induced by these GTPases are clearly different in appearance. Rac regulates lamellipodium formation and membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 regulates filopodium formation. Rac is also known to be involved in the activation of NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. Rac has two mammalian isoforms, Rac1 and Rac2, that exhibit a high sequence homology with 90% identities. Rac and Cdc42 also share a significant homology with 68% identities and, actually, bind to some common target proteins for activation. Rho, however, exhibits a relatively low similarity to those GTPases, an approximately 45% identity with both Rac and Cdc42. These differences in similarity are thought to be essential for the activation of several downstream target proteins of each small GTPase, although we do not yet understand the molecular basis of the specificities. Based on these differences, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC are hereafter referred to as the RhoA subfamily, and Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42 as the Rac1 subfamily. The Rho-binding domains of the target proteins consist of less than 100 residues and have been classified into at least two motifs (9Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Fukuta Y. Nakafuku M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The class 1 of the Rho-binding motif is characterized as a polybasic region followed by a leucine-zipper-like motif and is found in PKN, Rhophilin, Rhotekin, and MBS. Rho-kinase and Citron make up another class of the Rho-binding motif, the class 2, that has a putative coiled-coil motif located at the C terminus of the segment that is similar to myosin rod. It is of considerable interest that these sequences of the Rho-binding domains have no similarity to the binding domain of an activated Cdc42Hs-associated kinase (ACK) (22Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), a p21(Cdc42/Rac1)-activated protein kinase (PAK) (23Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), or the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (24Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Rho and the related small GTPases are the most common targets for bacterial toxins and are of major importance for the entry of bacteria into mammalian host cells. It is well known that various bacterial toxins can modify Rho by ADP-ribosylation, -glucosylation, and -deamidation. These toxins are classified into three families, C3-like exoenzymes such as Clostridium botulinum C3 ADP-ribosyltransferase, large clostridial cytotoxins such asClostridium difficile toxins A, and Rho-activating toxins such as Escherichia coli CNFs (25Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The C3-like exoenzymes act on members of the RhoA subfamily, but most of the large clostridial cytotoxins inactivate all members of the Rho family. The Rho-activating toxins activate members of the RhoA subfamily and Cdc42. No activity for Ras, Rap, and Ran has been reported for the bacterial toxins of these three families, but Clostridium sordelli HT, one of the large clostridial cytotoxins, is known to inactivate Ras and Rap. There is no interpretation for these emerging differences in the specificity of the small GTPases. Hence, it becomes essential to examine the three-dimensional structures of Rho to understand how their interactions with the target proteins control the various signaling processes and how the modifications by bacterial toxins change the activities of their target GTPases for bacterial invasion. We report here the crystal structure of recombinant human RhoA, which is dominantly activated with substitution of Gly14 by valine (RhoAV14), complexed with GTP analogue, GTPγS, and we compare it with the structures of H-Ras and other related GTPases. The cloning, expression, and purification of the dominantly active form of recombinant human RhoAV14 complexed with GTPγS and Mg2+ were carried out according to the methods described previously (8Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okada K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 9Matsui T.

The resulting active sample, used in this study, is verified with MALDI-TOF MS (JMS-ELITE, PerSeptive Inc.) and N-terminal analysis (M492, Applied Biosystems). The protein is truncated at Ala181 and has one additional serine residue at the N terminus. Crystals were obtained at 4 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method from solutions containing 10 mg/ml GTPγS-RhoAV14, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, 10% PEG8000, 7.5% 1,4-dioxane equilibrated against 100 mmconcentration of the same buffer containing 20% PEG8000 and 15% 1,4-dioxane. Plate-like crystals (Form A) grew within a few days and were found to diffract up to 2.4 Å resolution. The crystals belong to space group P21212 (a = 62.02 Å, b = 74.78 Å,c = 50.52 Å), with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Hexagonal crystals (Form B) also were obtained from solutions containing 10 mg/ml GTPγS-RhoAV14, 50 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 4.6, 10% 2-propanol equilibrated against 100 mm of the same buffer containing 20% 2-propanol. Crystals had hexagonal or trigonal lattice parameters with a rather longc axis (a = b = 60.80 Å,c = 214.56 Å) and diffracted at 3.0 Å. The structural analysis was performed using Form A. Intensity data were collected at 10 °C using an R-AXIS IIc imaging plate detector with CuKα x-rays generated by a rotating anode RU-300H (RIGAKU, Japan). The diffraction data were processed with PROCESS (RIGAKU). A summary of the data processing statistics are given in Table I. The initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (26Navara J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) using a search model based on the structure of human H-Ras (Protein Data Bank code 5P21, Brookhaven National Laboratory), with which RhoA shares a 27.5% identity. Several searches with a polyalanine model using different ranges of intensity data and integration radii resulted in a unique solution. Rigid body refinements of the searched model were performed with X-PLOR (27Brunger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The model obtained was divided into the secondary structure elements, and again, rigid body refinements were performed, followed by solvent flattening/histogram matching with the program DM (28Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Four regions of insertions and deletions were inspected on the resulting 2Fo-Fc map that was generated with the program O (29Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The structure was built and refined through alternating cycles using the programs O and X-PLOR, respectively.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsIntensity data processing of RhoAV14 crystalsRefinement statisticsResolution2.4 ÅRcryst1-cRcryst = 100 × ∑‖Fo (h) − Fc (h) ‖/∑ Fo (h), where Fo (h) and Fc (h) are observed and calculated reflections.19.5%Rmerge1-aRmerge = 100 × ∑‖I(h) − 〈I(h)〉‖/∑I(h), where 〈I(h)〉 is the mean intensity for reflection h.8.75% (26.7%)1-bBrackets are quantities calculated in the highest resolution bin at 2.5–2.4 Å.Rfree1-dRfree is Rcryst which was calculated using 10% of the data, chosen randomly and omitted from the subsequent molecular replacement and structure refinement.26.8%Number of measurements61,579R.m.s. bond lengths0.010 ÅNumber of independent reflections8,683R.m.s. bond angles1.314°Completeness89.3% (74.8%)1-bBrackets are quantities calculated in the highest resolution bin at 2.5–2.4 Å.R.m.s. dihedral angles22.368°Mean〈I/ς(I)〉7.91 (2.04)1-bBrackets are quantities calculated in the highest resolution bin at 2.5–2.4 Å.R.m.s.

Open table in a new tab Three regions were poorly defined in the resulting map. The first is at the loop and β-strand residues, Asp28-Gly50, which contain the switch I region connected to strand B2, and the second is at the residues of the switch II region. All residues in these regions were rebuilt on their omit maps. Structures of these parts were found to have large displacements from those of H-Ras (see text). The last is at the inserted residues, Glu125-Glu137, which is specific for members of the Rho-family. After several cycles of refinements incorporating solvent water molecules located at regions other than the inserted residues, we defined the residues forming a short 310-helix connected to an α-helix. The GTPγS molecule and the Mg2+ ion were identified unequivocally by their appearance in 2Fo-Fc maps. The γ-sulfur atom of GTPγS was also identified by its appearance in Fo-Fcmaps and its standard sulfur-phosphorus bond distance (1.9 Å), which is longer than the nonbridging oxygen-phosphorus bond (1.5 Å). Three N-terminal residues have uninterpretable densities implying complex disorder. The structure consists of one RhoAV14 molecule of 178 residues, one GTPγS, one Mg2+ ion, and 38 water molecules. The side chains of Arg5, Glu54, Arg68, and His126 are poorly defined in the current structure. There are no residues in disallowed regions as defined in PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). A summary of the refinement statistics is given in Table I. The structure was inspected using the program QUANTA (Molecular Simulators Inc). The major features of the fold, consisting of a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by helices connected with loops, are basically conserved as found in H-Ras (31Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M.

The β-sheet is formed by the anti-parallel association of two extended β-strands (B2 and B3) and the parallel association of five extended β-strands (B3, B1, B4–B6). RhoAV14 contains five α-helices (A1, A3, A3′, A4, and A5) and three 310-helices (H1–H3). There are three insertion and one deletion sites, which are common in the members of the Rho family, as can be seen from the sequence and secondary structure element alignment of RhoA and H-Ras (Fig. 2). The 13-residue insertion (Asp124-Gln136) is located at the loop between strand B5 and helix A4. Excluding the deletion and insertion residues, the Cα-carbon atoms of RhoAV14 and the corresponding dominantly activated H-RasV12, which is complexed with GTP (37Krengel U. Schlichting L. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), superimpose with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.68 Å for 163 common Cα-carbon atoms. This superposition yields an r.m.s. deviation of 0.87 Å for the atoms of the guanine nucleotide. Segments that involve major differences are located at the switch I and II regions and part of the antiparallel β-sheet, consisting of the C-terminal half of strand B2 and the N-terminal half of strand B3, in addition to the insertion and deletion sites described above (Fig. 3 A). Recently, Wei et al. have reported the crystal structure of RhoA bound to GDP (38Wei Y. Zhang Y. Derewenda U. Liu X. Minor W. Nakamoto R.K. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Derewenda Z.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Compared with this RhoA-GDP structure, the significant conformational changes were found to be localized in the switch I and II regions (Fig. 3 B), as described for H-Ras (31Milburn M.V. Tong L. de Vos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 39Tong L. de Vos A.M. Milburn M.V. Kim S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Excluding these regions, the Cα-carbon atoms of RhoAV14-GTPγS and RhoA-GDP superimpose with a r.m.s. deviation of 0.48 Å. The nonhydrolyzable nucleotide GTPγS binds to the protein with a Mg2+ ion that has a typical octahedral coordination sphere (Fig. 4).Figure 2Sequence alignment of human RhoA with the related human GTPases. Conserved residues are highlighted inyellow for the RhoA subfamily (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC), inred for the Rac1 subfamily (Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42), inblue for the Rho family, in light green for the Ras family (K-Ras, N-Ras, and H-Ras) and in gray for all members. The secondary structure elements of RhoAV14-GTPγS and H-RasV12-GTP complexes are indicated at the top and below the aligned sequences, respectively. The α-helices (A1-A5) are ingreen, the extended β (B1-B6) are in green, and the 310-helices (H1-H3) are in blue. Three functional regions of RhoA are also indicated with marks for the residues that participate in interactions with GTPγS (circles) and the Mg2+ ion (rectangles). The dominantly active mutation of glycine to valine is indicated by a star. The sequences are taken from SwissProt.

Segments displaying large displacements are highlighted inred for RhoAV14 and yellow for H-RasV12. These include switch I (residues 27–36 for RhoA), the anti-parallel β-sheet formed by strands B2 and B3 (residues 43–53), and switch II (residues 59–78). The 13-residue insertion (residues 122–137), forming helix A3′, and the segments helix A3 (residues 90–106), L7 (residues 107–110), and L9 (residues 151–154), which have insertion or deletion to produce large displacements, are in blue for RhoAV14.

The residues whose main chains participate in the hydrogen bonding are represented byrectangles, and the residues whose side chains participate in the hydrogen bonding are represented by ovals. The coordination bonds to the Mg2+ ion are indicated byarrows. The possible hydrogen bond between Gln63and Wat-3 has a longer distance (3.8 Å). The hydrogen bonds observed in the current structure but not in H-Ras are highlighted inred.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The N-terminal segment (Glu125-Lys133) of the 13-residue insertion forms an α-helix designated as A3′, which is followed by an extended loop. A short 310-helix, designated as H3 (Fig. 1), is induced at the segment flanking the N terminus of this insertion, with large displacements of Arg122 and Asn123 from those of H-RasV12 (3.0 Å and 6.1 Å, respectively). Compared with RhoA-GDP, however, no significant conformational change exists in the 13-residue insertion and its N-terminal flanking regions. This folding seems to be basically similar to that of Rac1 complexed with GMP-PNP (36Hirshberg M. Stockley R.W. Dodson G. Webb M.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) but shows many differences in details. It is notable that the sequences of this region of members in the RhoA subfamily is rather different from those of the Rac1 subfamily. Among the key residues in stabilization of helices H3 and A3′ (Fig. 5 A), Arg122 and Asp124 are conserved in the Rho family but Arg128, Glu137, and Lys140 are variant in the Rac1 subfamily. No water molecule is found to be involved in the structural stabilization of the RhoA insertion region, though Rac1 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond between the main chains. The conserved residues Leu131 and Pro138 of helix A3′ form a hydrophobic patch with Thr127 and Pro89, which are also conserved or conservatively replaced in the Rho family. Rac1 adds Ile126(Arg128 of RhoA) to the hydrophobic patch.Figure 5Various parts of RhoAV14-GTPγS. A, the 13-residue insertion subdomain of RhoAV14.

https://openalex.org/W2036387557,"Collagenase-3 (MMP-13) is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) originally identified in breast carcinomas which is also produced at significant levels during fetal ossification and in arthritic processes. In this work, we have found that transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), a growth factor widely assumed to be inhibitory for MMPs, strongly induces collagenase-3 expression in human KMST fibroblasts. In contrast, this growth factor down-regulated the expression in these cells of collagenase-1 (MMP-1), an enzyme highly related to collagenase-3 in terms of structure and enzymatic properties. The positive effect of TGF-β1 on collagenase-3 expression was dose- and time-dependent, but independent of the effects of this growth factor on cell proliferation rate. Analysis of the signal transduction mechanisms underlying the up-regulating effect of TGF-β1 on collagenase-3 expression demonstrated that this growth factor acts through a signaling pathway involving protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase activities. Functional analysis of the collagenase-3 gene promoter region revealed that the inductive effect of TGF-β1 is partially mediated by an AP-1 site. Comparative analysis with the promoter region of the collagenase-1 gene which contains an AP-1 site at equivalent position, confirmed that TGF-β1 did not have any effect on CAT activity levels of this promoter. Finally, by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antibody supershift analysis, we propose that c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD may play major roles in the collagenase-3 activation by TGF-β1 in human fibroblasts.

Biochemical characterization of recombinant human collagenase-3 has revealed that it degrades very efficiently the native helix of fibrillar collagens with preferential activity on type II collagen (15Knäuper V.

Consequently, the three human collagenases characterized to date show distinct substrate specificities strongly suggesting that they have evolved as specialized enzymes to degrade tissues with different collagen composition. In addition to its degrading activity on fibrillar collagens, further analysis of the substrate specificity of collagenase-3 has revealed that this enzyme may also act as a potent gelatinase thus contributing to further degrade the initial cleavage products of collagenolysis to small fragments suitable for subsequent metabolism (15Knäuper V.

At present, very little information is available on the mechanisms controlling collagenase-3 expression in both normal and pathological conditions. Thus, although several groups have reported that human collagenase-3 gene expression can be induced by IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α in chondrocytes from normal and osteoarthritic cartilage (22Mitchell P.G. Magna H.A. Reeves L.M. Lopresti-Morrow L.L. Yocum S.A. Rosner P.J. Geoghegan K.F. Hambor J.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 23Reboul P. Pelletier J.P.

In this regard, and based on in situ hybridization experiments and on co-cultures of fibroblast and epithelial breast cancer cells, we have recently proposed that collagenase-3 is predominantly expressed within fibroblasts adjacent to the invasive tumor cells in response to diffusible factors released from the breast cancer cells (28Urı́a J.A. Stahle-Bäckdahl M. Seiki M. Fueyo A. López-Otı́n C. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4882-4888PubMed Google Scholar). A preliminary search of putative factors with ability to induce collagenase-3 expression in human fibroblasts revealed that only IL-1 and TPA were able to up-regulate the expression of this gene in KMST fibroblastic cells. By contrast, a series of cytokines and growth factors factors including aFGF, bFGF, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, and TGF-α, previously found to play important roles in up-regulating expression of other MMPs, did not show any effect on collagenase-3 expression by human fibroblasts. Since these findings strongly suggested that the mechanisms regulating collagenase-3 expression could be distinct to those operating in the control of other MMPs, we have extended our preliminary search for factors that could act as mediators of collagenase-3 expression in breast carcinomas. In this work, we show that TGF-β, a growth factor widely assumed to be inhibitory for MMPs like collagenase-1, strongly up-regulates collagenase-3 expression in KMST fibroblasts. We also analyze the mechanisms mediating this induction with the finding that this growth factor acts through a signaling pathway involving tyrosine kinase and protein kinase C activities. Finally, we perform a functional characterization of the promoter region of the collagenase-3 gene looking for the putative elements with ability to mediate the induction of this gene by TGF-β.DISCUSSIONIn this work we have shown that expression of human collagenase-3, a matrix metalloproteinase produced by breast carcinomas and arthritic cartilage, is induced by TGF-β1 in cultured human fibroblasts. This up-regulatory effect of TGF-β1 on the production of a potent proteolytic enzyme like collagenase-3 is in marked contrast with the widely assumed role of this growth factor as an inducer of anabolic responses in mesenchymal cells. In fact, TGF-β has been implicated in the induction of connective tissue formation by stimulating the synthesis of several extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin, thrombospondin, and types I and III collagen (35Ignotz R.A.

In addition, TGF-β suppresses the overall degrading activity on these matrix components through a concerted dual action involving the reduction in the production of a wide diversity of proteolytic enzymes including MMPs (53Edwards D.R.

The ability of TGF-β family members to induce collagenase-3 expression is not exclusive of fibroblasts, since a recent report has shown that TGF-β2 up-regulates its expression in transformed keratinocytes (59Johansson N. Westermarck J. Leppä S. Häkkinen L. Koivisto L. López-Otı́n C. Peltonen J. Heino J. Kähäri V.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, another recent report has shown that TGF-β1 inhibits collagenase-3 expression in osteoblast cultures (60Rydziel S. Varghese S. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), suggesting that the effects of these growth factors are markedly dependent of the cell type. Nevertheless, the ability of TGF-β to stimulate the production of a proteolytic enzyme by human fibroblastic cells is not unprecedented, since Overall et al. (58Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1860-1869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14064-14071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that levels of gelatinase A (MMP-2) are increased in gingival fibroblasts, although the magnitude of this up-regulating effect is lesser than that observed in the present work for collagenase-3. The possibility that collagenase-3 and gelatinase A are coordinately regulated in fibroblasts is of interest in light of recent findings demonstrating that both enzymes form part of an activation cascade which can generate the extracellular collagenolytic activity requested for the connective tissue degradation occurring in both normal and pathological conditions (62Knäuper V. Will H. López-Otı́n C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17124-17131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In this context, it is specially noteworthy that collagenase-1 (MMP-1), despite sharing with collagenase-3 its unique ability to initiate degradation of the native helix of fibrillar collagens, shows a completely opposite response to TGF-β1 treatment. In fact, and as a consequence of the structural complexity of the extracellular matrix and basement membranes which must be proteolytically degraded by MMPs, these enzymes are often coregulated by the same cells in response to the same stimuli. In the case of collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 production by human fibroblasts, this statement seems to be true for cytokines like IL-1α and IL-1β and for tumor promoters like TPA, all of them displaying a marked up-regulatory effect on both MMP genes (Fig. 1). However, their divergent responses to TGF-β1 clearly indicate that in addition to common regulatory elements, these genes have distinct transcriptional elements that determine their specific expression patterns. Functional studies of the promoter region of the collagenase-3 gene performed in this work have shown that the AP-1 site present in its 5′-flanking region is responsible, at least in part, for the TGF-β1 mediated induction of this gene. AP-1 sites have also been reported to mediate the response to this growth factor of other genes such as type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (63Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), osteocalcin (64Banerjee C. Stein J.L. Van Wijnen A.J. Frenkel B. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), retinoic acid and retinoid X receptors (65Chen Y. Takeshita A. Ozaki S. Kitanor S. Hanazawa S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31602-31606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), as well as the autoinduction of the TGF-β1 gene itself (66Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the extent of stimulation of collagenase-3 gene expression by TGF-β1, as detected by Northern blot, was higher than the induction of promoter activity observed in transient cell transfection experiments with AP-1 containing constructs. Similar observations have been previously reported during the functional analysis of AP-1 sites present in other MMP genes (67Gaire M. Magbanua Z. McDonnell S. McNeill L. Lovett D.H. Matrisian L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2032-2040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,68Benbow U. Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems likely that this AP-1 site present in the collagenase-3 gene is necessary but not sufficient for mediating its response to TGF-β1 in human fibroblasts. The participation of additional elements which could be located further upstream in the 5′-flanking region of the collagenase-3 gene could contribute to explain the differences observed between data derived from Northern blot analysis and those from determination of relative CAT activity of reporter gene constructs. In addition, it is remarkable that other MMP genes, including collagenase-1, which are down-regulated by TGF-β, also contain AP-1 consensus sequences at approximately the same position as that present in the collagenase-3 gene (Fig. 7), thus supporting the idea that sequences other than AP-1 influence the responsiveness of the different MMP genes to this growth factor. Finally, it is also likely that TGF-β1, in addition to activating the collagenase-3 promoter, may increase the expression of this gene by post-transcriptional mechanisms such as stabilization of the corresponding mRNAs, which have been previously described to operate in the case of the collagenase-1 gene (69Vincenti M.P. Coon C.I. Lee O. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4818-4827Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).In an attempt to determine the molecular basis of the somewhat paradoxical effect of TGF-β1 on collagenase-3 expression in human fibroblasts, we have further investigated the mechanistic aspects underlying this up-regulatory effect. In this work, and by using a series of specific inhibitors for different signaling pathways, we have found that the TGF-β1 action on collagenase-3 is mediated by PKC and tyrosine kinase signal transduction pathways. Since TGF-β receptors are Ser/Thr kinases, it is tempting to speculate that the activity affected by PKC inhibitors could be that intrinsic to the TGF-β receptors themselves. However, the observation that TGFβ-RI and -RII autophosphorylation is not affected by PKC inhibitors (70Miettinen P.J. Ebner R. López A.R. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2021-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar) suggests that additional kinase activities acting downstream from the TGF-β receptor are involved in mediating the induction of collagenase-3 by TGF-β1. In addition, we have tried to correlate the TGF-β1 positive effect on collagenase-3 expression with some of the pleiotropic effects elicited by this multifunctional growth factor. It is well known that TGF-β displays a wide variety of actions even in the same cell type, depending on a number of factors including the specific target, conditions of cell culture, and presence of other growth regulators. Consistent with this, the observation that collagenase-3 induction by TGF-β1 in fibroblasts is accompanied by a weak stimulation of cell growth, together with data showing that in HaCaT keratinocytes TGF-β mediated up-regulation of this enzyme is accompanied by a potent inhibition of cell growth, 2J. A. Urı́a and C. López-Otı́n, unpublished results. strongly suggest that induction of collagenase-3 by this growth factor is independent of its effects on cell proliferation.Finally, in this work we have examined the possibility that cell specific induction of distinct members of the Fos/Jun family of transcription factors is responsible for the divergent regulation of collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 genes by TGF-β1 in human fibroblasts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and antibody supershift analysis revealed that c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunD are found in complexes formed with nuclear extracts prepared from KMST cells treated with TGF-β1. Analysis of the pattern of expression of these Fos/Jun proto-oncogenes in KMST cells treated with TGF-β1 confirmed that collagenase-3 induction is preceded by an increase in levels of expression of c-Fos and JunD. According to these results, it is conceivable that the induction of high levels of c-Fos and JunD favors the formation of specific complexes which bind and transactivate the collagenase-3 promoter, thus resulting in the observed up-regulation of this gene. Nevertheless, the participation of c-Jun in the process, after post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation induced by TGF-β such as phosphorylation mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (47Wang W. Zhou G. Hu M.C.-T. Yao Z. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22771-22775Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), cannot be ruled out. In this regard, it is well known that the preferential binding to AP-1 sites exhibited by different Fos/Jun proteins is dependent upon specific flanking and core nucleotide sequences, thus allowing fine regulation of expression of the diverse AP-1 driven genes. c-Jun and c-Fos have been proposed to be fundamental intermediates for collagenase-1 and stromelysin-1 gene activation by tumor necrosis factor-α in fibroblasts, and by TGF-β in keratinocytes, whereas inhibitory effects have been reported to be mediated by transient elevation of JunB (42Mauviel A. Chen Y.Q. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 822-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 45Mauviel A. Chung K.-Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, in KMST cells, TGF-β had little if any effect on the expression of c-Jun or JunB, thus indicating that at least in these cells, other mechanisms should be involved in TGF-β1 elicited down-regulation of collagenase-1.In summary, we have provided evidence that TGF-β dissociates production of collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 by human fibroblasts. The opposite response of both enzymes to TGF-β1 in KMST cells makes them an appropriate model system for studying the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of these two highly related enzymes in terms of structure and enzymatic properties, but displaying marked differences in their pattern of tissue expression. Further studies will be also required to evaluate the putative role of TGF-β1 as anin vivo inducer of human collagenase-3 in those conditions in which this enzyme has been found at high levels, including breast carcinomas and arthritic processes.

These enzymes play a major role in normal tissue remodeling processes such as embryonic development, bone growth, and resorption, ovulation, uterine involution, and wound healing (1Woessner J.F.

Recombinant actin-binding domain (residues 2–269) binds actin filaments with a Kd of 1 μm at 25 °C, 20 times stronger than actin-binding domain produced by thermolysin digestion of native α-actinin (residues 25–257). Between 8 and 25 °C the rate constants for recombinant actin-binding domain to bind to (0.8–2.7 μm−1 s−1) and dissociate from (0.2–2.4 s−1) actin filaments depend on temperature. At 8 °C actin filaments cross-linked with α-actinin are stiff and nearly solid, whereas at 25 °C the mechanical properties approach those of actin filaments alone. In these experiments, high actin concentrations kept most of the α-actinin bound to actin and temperature varied a single parameter, cross-linker dynamics, because the mechanical properties of pure actin filaments (a viscoelastic gel) or biotinylated actin filaments cross-linked irreversibly by avidin (a stiff viscoelastic solid) depend little on temperature. These results show that the rate of exchange of dynamic cross-links between actin filaments is an important determinant of the mechanical properties of the networks.

These results show that the rate of exchange of dynamic cross-links between actin filaments is an important determinant of the mechanical properties of the networks. Cytoplasm is viscoelastic, so that it can either deform or rebound in response to force (1Bray D. Heath J. Moss D. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1986; 4: 71-88Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Elson E.L. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 397-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Deformation is essential for cellular movement, whereas elastic responses allow cells to maintain their shapes. Scientists have appreciated this duality of cytoplasm for more than 100 years (see Ref. 3Pollard T.D. J. Supramol. Struct. 1976; 5: 317-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar for a review of early work). To explain these complicated properties, Frey-Wyssling (4Frey-Wyssling A. Submicroscopic Morphology of Protoplasm and Its Derivatives. Elsevier, New York1948Google Scholar) proposed that cytoplasm consists of a network of long thin filaments held together by dynamic cross-links that can resist rapid deformation but allow slow deformation in response to sustained force. He did not know the molecular nature of the filaments or cross-links, because his suggestion, originally made in the late 1930s, predated the discovery of actin in muscle (5Straub Y. Feuer G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1950; 4: 455-470Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and nonmuscle cells (6Hatano S. Oosawa F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Later Pollard and Ito (7Pollard T.D. Ito S J. Cell Biol. 1970; 46: 267-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) identified actin filaments as major contributors to the cytoplasmic gel, and Sato et al. (8Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) found that the mechanical properties of actin filament networks cross-linked withAcanthamoeba α-actinin depend on the rate of deformation. At low rates of deformation, a network containing α-actinin is no stiffer than the actin filaments alone, but at high rates of deformation, the network is far stiffer than actin alone. They postulated that amoeba α-actinin forms dynamic cross-links between actin filaments and suggested that the Frey-Wyssling model might explain the ability of cells to resist rapid deformation but change shape in response to a slowly imposed force. This hypothesis raised the question of whether dynamic cross-linkers are a general feature of actin filament networks. Janmey et al. (9Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) reported that actin-binding protein (ABP-280) 1The abbreviations used are: ABP, actin-binding protein; ABD, actin-binding domain; rABD, recombinant ABD. from a human smooth muscle tumor is not a dynamic cross-linker. ABP/actin gels have a higher elastic modulus than gels of actin filaments alone at all frequencies tested, similar to biotin-labeled actin filaments cross-linked irreversibly by avidin (10Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Much lower concentrations of ABP than amoeba α-actinin were needed to affect the modulus of actin gels. They argued that if cytoplasmic actin filaments were cross-linked by proteins like ABP-280, then rearrangement of cross-links could not account for the properties of cytoplasm. This work emphasized the need to explore the effects of cross-linkers with a range of affinities for actin. The affinity of macrophage and smooth muscle ABP-280 for actin is about 1 μm (11Hartwig J.H. Stossel T.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 563-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Gorlin J.B.

Biotin-actin/avidin gels are a viscoelastic solid at all frequencies, and concentrations of avidin >0.03 μm do not increase the stiffness. At 0.03 μm smooth muscle α-actinin increased the complex modulus 10-fold less than biotin/avidin. At higher concentrations, smooth muscle α-actinin makes bundles of actin filaments that behave like a viscoelastic fluid (14Meyer R.K. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 16Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys.

High concentrations of amoeba α-actinin are required to increase the stiffness, and the complex modulus depends dramatically on frequency. The current work investigates actin filament cross-linking by α-actinin in more detail to determine the effect of cross-linker dynamics on the mechanical properties in a system with only one variable, the temperature. We used chicken smooth muscle α-actinin, because temperature affects its affinity for actin filaments (17Holmes G.R. Goll D.E. Suzuki A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 253: 240-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Previous studies examined the effect of temperature of gels of actin and α-actinin (19Grazi E. Cuneo P. Magri E. Schwienbacher C. Trombetta G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8896-8901Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 20Grazi E. Trombetta G. Magri E. Cuneo P. Schwienbacher C. Biochem.

Rev. 1996; 54: 1802-1810Google Scholar), but this is the first to correlate rheological measurements and binding rate constants on the same preparations of proteins. α-Actinins consist of two identical polypeptides of 103 kDa with an N-terminal 30-kDa actin-binding domain, a tail with triple helical repeats, and two C-terminal EF hands (22Critchley D.R. Kreis T. Vale R. α-Actinins: Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 22-23Google Scholar). The rod-shaped tails associate to form an anti-parallel dimer with an actin filament-binding site on each end. The bivalent protein cross-links actin filament into three-dimensional gels or bundles depending upon the conditions (16Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We used the monovalent actin-binding domain (ABD) for our kinetic analysis to avoid complications arising from two binding sites. We assume that the properties of isolated ABD are the same as the heads of bivalent α-actinin molecules. We initiated these experiments with ABD produced from chicken smooth muscle α-actinin by proteolytic digestion (14Meyer R.K. Aebi U. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) but found that this fragment differs in size and affinity for actin compared with full-length recombinant ABD, which also provides a convenient fluorescence change when it binds actin filaments (18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We show that actin filament networks cross-linked by α-actinin differ fundamentally from biotin-actin/avidin gels. Biotin-actin/avidin gels are viscoelastic solid at all frequencies and temperatures tested. α-Actinin/actin gels are less stiff, and the stiffness varies with temperature, because cross-linker dynamics depend on the temperature. Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle (23Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) using Sephacryl S-300 instead of Sephadex G-150 for gel filtration. α-Actinin was purified from chicken smooth muscle (25Craig S.W. Lancashire C.L. Cooper J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both actin and α-actinin were stored by dialysis against daily changes of Buffer G (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm NaN3) and used within 5 days of purification. Lyophilized avidin (Pierce) was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in Buffer G. Actin was labeled with biotin as described by Wachsstock et al. (15Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and Janmey et al. (9Janmey P.A. Hvidt S. Lamb J. Stossel T.P. Nature. 1990; 345: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) by reacting polymerized actin with a 7-fold molar excess of iodoacetyl-N′-biotinhexenediamine (from a 40 mm stock in dimethylformamide). After purification by pelleting, depolymerization, and gel filtration, the extent of biotinylation was measured by the displacement of 2-[4′-hydroxyazobenzene] benzoic acid from avidin with a kit from Pierce. The actin was approximately 30% biotinylated. This actin was diluted to 2% biotinylated actin with unlabeled actin for the experiments. The ABD of chicken smooth muscle α-actinin was cleaved from the tails by digestion with thermolysin coupled to agarose beads (Sigma) and purified according to Wachsstock et al. (15Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), a modification of the method of Pavalko and Burridge (26Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The thermolysin beads were filtered out and the soluble pABD was recovered in the void volume of a 5-ml Econo-Q column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Buffer G. The column retains the 53-kDa rod domain. Dr. Wolfgang Fischer of The Salk Institute for Biological Studies determined the N-terminal sequence of this pABD by automated Edman degradation and determined its mass by mass spectrometry. Dr. D. R. Critchley (University of Leicester, UK) kindly provided anNcoI-HincII restriction enzyme fragment encoding the ABD of chicken smooth muscle α-actinin (residues 2–269, residue 1 = initiator met) cloned into expression vector pMW 172 (27Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recombinant ABD (rABD) was expressed in the BL21.de3 strain ofEscherichia coli and purified by modifications of method Kuhlman et al. (18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were sonicated in 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, at 25 °C) and clarified. The supernatant was dialyzed against Buffer T (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol) for 3 h. rABD was eluted with 60 mm NaCl from a 2 × 16-cm DE-52 fast flow anion exchange column (Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK) equilibrated with Buffer T. After precipitation with 60% ammonium sulfate, rABD was resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer G and chromatographed on a 1 × 100-cm column of Sephadex G-75. The rABD peak was run on a MonoQ column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with Buffer G and eluted with a linear gradient of 10–500 mm NaCl. The concentration of ABD was determined by absorbance using the extinction coefficient A280 = 23.8 μm·cm−1 (27Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or by the Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) method standardized with bovine serum albumin. The rate constant (kobs) for rABD binding to actin filaments was measured from the time course of the decrease in the intrinsic fluorescence after mixing equal volumes of the ABD and actin (18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the stopped flow instrument described by Sinard and Pollard (29Sinard J.H. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3654-3660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 289 nm with a short pass filter (Oriel, Stratford, CT), and emission was monitored using a 330-nm-long pass filter (Oriel, Stratford, CT). A thermocirculator controlled the temperature of the sample and the observation cell. Actin in Buffer G was polymerized for >2 h by adding one-tenth volume of 10× KME buffer (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). ABD was made up in the same buffer. Prior to loading the stopped flow syringes, proteins were diluted to desired concentrations with Buffer F (2 mm Tris, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.3 mm NaN3). After rapid mixing (dead time, 3 ms), we collected 500 data points at a sampling interval of 0.1 or 1 ms. Transients were fitted to single exponentials. Association rate constants (k+) were determined from the dependence of kobs on rABD concentration. rABD concentrations were at least 4-fold higher than actin. Rate constants for ABD dissociation from actin filaments were determined from the time course of the increase in intrinsic fluorescence after diluting the complex at least 20-fold with Buffer F. Measurements were made in a Photon Technology International Alphascan fluorescence spectrophotometer (Brunswick, NJ). The samples were diluted two ways: 1) syringe injection of 5 μl of complex into 3 ml of Buffer F in a 1 × 1-cm cuvette rapidly stirred with a magnetic stirring bar or 2) using a hand-driven model SFA-12 Rapid Kinetics Stopped Flow Accessory (Hi-Tech Scientific Ltd., Salisbury, UK) with a dead time of about 20 ms. The temperature of the sample handling system was maintained with circulating water. Actin and ABD were copolymerized by adding one-tenth volume of concentrated polymerized buffer 10× KME for at least 2 h. The time course was fitted with a single exponential. Various concentrations of actin with a fixed concentration of ABD were polymerized for 1 h at room temperature in 1× KME buffer and then centrifuged 200,000 × g for 40 min at 25 °C. The supernatants were concentrated by precipitation with chloroform/methanol, and the proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in SDS. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the gel was digitized using the program Adobe PhotoShop 3.0, and the integrated densities of the ABD bands were measured with the program NIH Image 1.6. These densities were converted to concentrations using ABD standards on the same gel, and the binding isotherm was determined by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to a hyperbola. The rheological measurements were made with a parallel plate Rheometrics RFS II rheometer (Rheometrics Inc., NJ) in the small amplitude (strain, ≤2%) forced oscillation mode (30Sato M. Leimbach G. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8585-8592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Monomeric actin was mixed with one-tenth volume of 10× KME polymerization buffer and immediately placed between the metal plates of the rheometer to polymerize at desired temperature. The plates were sealed with mineral oil (Sigma) to prevent sample dehydration. Measurements of G′ and G“ were made every 30 s using time sweep mode to observe the gel formation. AfterG′ and G” reached a plateau, frequency sweep mode was used to measure the rheological parameters: the magnitude of complex modulus ‖G*‖, where ‖G*‖ = (G′ 2 + G“ 2)1/2; and the phase shift δ, where δ = ταν−1(G”/G′) (31Ferry J.D. Viscoelastic Properties of Polymers. John Wiley & Sons, New York1980Google Scholar). A solid has a phase shift of 0. A viscous liquid has phase shift of 1.6 radians. Relaxation experiments measured stress relaxation (τ(t)) after a step input strain (γo) as a function of time. The relaxation modulus G(t) = τ(t)/γo. Unlike a dynamic mechanical assay, a stress relaxation assay does not require deformation of the actin network after the initial strain. Both recombinant and proteolytic ABD preparations bind actin filaments in pelleting experiments (Fig. 1), but the affinities for actin filaments differ by an order of magnitude (Table I). At room temperature, the Kd values are 1.6 μm for rABD and 20 μm for pABD. This establishes that the wide range of affinities reported in the literature (Table I) are due to the methods of preparation and not differences in the assays.Table IRate and equilibrium constants for chicken smooth muscle α-actinin binding skeletal muscle actin filamentsTemperaturek+k−KdMethodReference°Cμm−1 s−1s −1μmRecombinant actin-binding domain80.80.2 ± 0.040.3SF/fluorescenceCurrent work 151.40.8 ± 0.040.6SF/fluorescenceCurrent work 252.72.4 ± 0.10.9SF/fluorescenceCurrent work50.20.5NDSF/fluorescence18Kuhlman P.A.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar Open table in a new tab Although both ABDs bind actin filaments, the intrinsic fluorescence of the complexes differs. Under a variety of conditions the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of mixtures of pABD and actin filaments is the same as the sum of the fluorescence of the separate proteins. On the other hand, we confirmed that mixtures of rABD and actin filaments have at least 5% lower intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence than the sum of the individual proteins (18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This fluorescence change makes rABD useful for kinetic analysis of the binding reaction. The two ABD preparations also differ in primary structure. Proteolytic ABD has a higher mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr 27 kDa) than the rABD (Mr 32 kDa). By Edman degradation the N-terminal sequence of pABD is LLDPAXEKQQRKXFXA, identical to residues 25–40 (initiator M = 1) coded by the cDNA clone (32Baron M.D. Davison M.D. Jones P. Critchley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17623-17629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By mass spectroscopy, the monoisotopic mass of pABD is 26,532, so its C terminus is Glu257. Recombinant ABD consists of residues 2–269 (27Way M. Pope B. Weeds A.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), including Trp20, which may contribute to the fluorescence change associated with actin filament binding. We followed the binding of rABD to actin filaments under pseudo-first order conditions with a molar excess of rABD over polymerized actin subunits. Following rapid mixing in the stopped flow instrument, rABD binds to actin filaments accompanied by a quench in tryptophan fluorescence that follows an exponential time course (Fig. 2 A), as first reported by Kuhlman et al. (18Kuhlman P.A. Ellis J. Critchley D.R. Bagshaw C.R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The pseudo-first order rate constant of the fluorescence change depends linearly on rABD concentration up to a rate of at least 80 s−1 (Fig. 2 B). A simple model for the reaction is a bimolecular binding event followed by a first order change in fluorescence.ABD+actin⇔ABD­actin⇔*ABD­actinReaction 1 The absence of curvature in the plots of kobs versus rABD shows that the fluorescence change is much faster than binding under our conditions (>80 s−1). The slopes of these plots at three temperatures give the apparent second order association rate constants (k+) (Table I). We measured the dissociation of rABD from actin filaments after dilution of the complex. Dissociation is accompanied by an increase in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3). These data are noisy due to the very low concentrations of protein after dilution but could be fit with a single exponential. The dissociation rate constants are more temperature-dependent than the association rate constants (Table I). The dissociation equilibrium constants (Kd) are calculated from the ratio of the rate constants (Table I). Actin filament networks are viscoelastic materials with mechanical properties that are strongly influenced by cross-linking proteins. This study addresses the hypothesis (8Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Wachsstock D.H. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that the rate of cross-linker dissociation is a major determinant of the mechanical properties of actin gels. The particular test was to use temperature to vary the dissociation rate constant of the well characterized cross-linker smooth muscle α-actinin and to measure how this single parameter influences the mechanical properties of a cross-linked actin gel, under conditions where network is isotropic and the actin concentration is high enough that most α-actinin is bound at all temperatures. First we determined how temperature influences the mechanical properties of actin filaments alone and irreversibly cross-linked actin filaments. We used avidin to cross-link actin filaments containing a few subunits carrying biotin, a high affinity ligand for tetravalent avidin (9 14). The earlier work showed that such tightly cross-linked actin filaments form a stiff, solid gel independent of the rate of deformation. The Kd for avidin and biotin is 10−15m (10Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 184: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). Assumingk+ = 108m−1 s−1,k− is about 10−7 s−1, a negligible rate in the laboratory or cellular context. Over a wide range of deformation frequencies, networks of biotinylated-actin filaments (Fig. 4) have the same mechanical properties as filaments of unmodified actin (Fig. 5). The complex modulus (‖G*‖) measures stiffness, and phase shift (δ) measures whether the material behaves like a solid (δ = 0), a liquid (δ = 1.6 radians), or in between like many viscoelastic materials. These mechanical properties of actin and biotin-actin filaments vary by less than 10% with temperatures over the range of 8–40 °C, confirming the observations of Sato et al. (8Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) on actin.Figure 5The dependence of the mechanical properties of actin filaments cross-linked with smooth muscle α-actinin on temperature and the frequency of deformation.

B, phase shift (δ).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Biotin-actin filaments cross-linked irreversibly by avidin are very stiff (Fig. 4 A) with a phase shift close to zero, like a solid (Fig. 4 B). The mechanical properties of these irreversibly cross-linked actin filament gels are independent of temperature in the range of 8–40 °C (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus the mechanical properties of the filaments themselves are not sensitive to temperature in this range. In contrast to either filaments of pure actin or irreversibly cross-linked actin filaments, the mechanical properties of actin filament networks cross-linked by chicken smooth muscle α-actinin depend strongly on temperature (Figs. 5and 6 A). At 8 °C the networks are stiff and nearly solid. At 25 °C the networks approach the properties of actin alone. The mechanical properties of actin filaments cross-linked with amoeba α-actinin depend on temperature in a similar way (8Sato M. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Nature. 1987; 325: 828-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A relaxation experiment (Fig. 6 B) confirmed these properties. G(t) of actin filament networks relaxes much more quickly than networks of actin filaments cross-linked by α-actinin. At long times (104 s) the plateau modulus of actin filaments alone is independent of temperature and much lower than actin filaments cross-linked by α-actinin. The plateau modulus of cross-linked filaments depends on temperature. The difference is particularly striking at 8 °C, where G is higher by a factor of 100. Thus α-actinin cross-links account for most of the elastic modulus, and the contribution of entangled filaments is negligible. This and previous work (14Meyer R.K. Aebi U. J.

In previous work on pABD of smooth muscle α-actinin, it was assumed that thermolysin simply cleaves the ABD from the α-helical tail (14Meyer R.K. Aebi U. J.

Activation involves the transfer of cytosolic subunits designated p47PHOX and p67PHOX to the plasma membrane, where they associate with a flavocytochrome known as cytochrome b558 to assemble the active oxidase (2Heyworth P.G.

During oxidase activation in whole cells, p47PHOX becomes phosphorylated on numerous serine residues that lie between Ser303 and Ser379 in the C-terminal quarter of this 390-residue molecule (3Hayakawa T.

The present report is concerned with the phosphorylation of p47PHOX Ser303 and Ser304 in relation to the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase. The mutants p47PHOX S303A/S304A, S303D/S304D, S303E/S304E, and S315A/S320A were constructed by single strand mutagenesis of the p47PHOX cDNA as described previously (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was performed on cDNA cloned into pBluescript II KS+. The mutated cDNAs were then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector EBOpLPP. Mutations that altered the sequence of the protein were accompanied by silent mutations of nearby restriction sites, introduced to aid in screening. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing in the departmental facility. The S303K/S304K, S303A/S304E, and S303E/S304A mutations were constructed by a PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; WT, wild-type; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus. strategy. In each case, the 5′ end of the “forward” primer spanned a unique NarI site 16 bases upstream of the 303 codon, the appropriately altered 303 and 304 codons, and 18 additional bases of native downstream sequence. A 19-base “reverse” primer that spanned an NaeI site about 180 base pairs downstream from the 304 codon was used for all three PCR mutagenesis reactions. PCR was performed with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using the wild-type p47PHOX cDNA as template. The PCR products were isolated from agarose gels using QIAEXII (Qiagen) and digested withNarI and NaeI. The resulting fragments were ligated into the NarI and NaeI sites of the p47PHOX S303A/S304A plasmid, a procedure that introduced the desired mutation into the product and destroyed a BssHII site that was introduced during the construction of the p47PHOX S303A/S304A cDNA. All PCR mutations were confirmed and the constructs documented to be error-free by sequencing across the fullNarI-NaeI span.

Open table in a new tab EBV-transformed p47PHOX-deficient B lymphocytes were co-transfected with SV40 plus wild-type or mutant p47PHOX expression vectors as indicated, and expanded under hygromycin selection as described previously (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), except that the p47PHOX-deficient cells were maintained at 0.5–1.0 × 106/ml before transfection and 106 cells/ml after transfection. Transfected cells were assayed only when fewer than 10% of the cells took up trypan blue. The cell line used for these experiments contained an uncharacterized mutation in the p47PHOX gene that prevented the expression of p47PHOX. Leukocyte NADPH oxidase activity was measured by chemiluminescence. Assays using whole cells were carried out as described elsewhere (11Thrasher A. Chetty M. Casimir C. Segal A.W. Blood. 1992; 80: 1125-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that 4 × 106 cells and 10 IU of horseradish peroxidase were used in a final volume of 0.35 ml. The cell suspensions were placed in a 96-well microplate, warmed to 37 °C, then activated at the same temperature with phorbol myristate acetate (1 μg/ml). Chemiluminescence was then measured at 1-min intervals using a Luminoskan luminometer (Labsystems Research, Finland) at 37 °C. For measurement of leukocyte NADPH oxidase activity in a cell-free system, reaction mixtures contained 1.6 × 106 cell equivalents of neutrophil membranes, 9 × 106 cell equivalents of B lymphocyte cytosol, 1 mm luminol, 5 IU of horseradish peroxidase, 90 μm SDS, 160 μmNADPH, and Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.5 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2, with or without 50 IU of superoxide dismutase, in final volume of 1 ml. Cytosol was prepared by sonicating a suspension of lymphoblasts in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for three 10-s intervals at 4 °C, then removing particles by centrifugation for 15 min at the same temperature in an Eppendorf Microfuge. Initially, the assay mixture contained all the components except SDS and NADPH. The oxidase was then activated by adding SDS and incubating for 1 min at room temperature. O·̄2production was then initiated with NADPH, and chemiluminescence was measured at successive 10-s interval using a Luminoskan luminometer at room temperature. The expression of p47PHOX in the transfected cells and the translocation of p47PHOX from cytosol to membranes was determined by immunoblotting (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fractions were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels using the Laemmli buffer system. The separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, which was blocked with Blotto and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of an antibody against the C-terminal decapeptide of WT p47PHOX. In measurements of p47PHOX expression in whole cells, p47PHOX on the immunoblots was visualized with alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies followed by visualization with the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium detection system (12Park J.-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression was measured by densitometry with a Zeinieh laser scanner, determining relative quantities of p47PHOX from peak heights. In the translocation experiments, peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance; DuPont, Boston, MA) were used for the visualization of p47PHOX. In prior studies, we have shown that the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase in neutrophils and EBV-transformed B lymphocytes is accompanied by the phosphorylation of serines 303 and 304 in the cytosolic oxidase component p47PHOX (7el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the possibility that the phosphorylation of these serines is involved in oxidase activation, we reported that the conversion of either Ser303 or Ser304 to alanine resulted in a >50% decrease in O·̄2 production by EBV-transformed lymphocytes expressing the mutant p47PHOX proteins (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For the individual serines these decreases were not statistically significant (p > 0.05), but a level of significance of p < 0.004 was achieved when the results were reanalyzed under the hypothesis that the loss of either one of these serines resulted in a decrease in O·̄2 production (Wilcoxon rank sum test). This analysis suggested that the phosphorylation of at least one of these serines was necessary for oxidase activation in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes. To test this possibility, O·̄2 production was measured in p47PHOX-deficient EBV-transformed B lymphocytes expressing p47PHOX with a number of double mutations at positions Ser303 and Ser304. Time courses for O·̄2production by untransformed B lymphocytes and by cells expressing wild-type or mutant forms of p47PHOX are illustrated in Fig. 1; peak chemiluminescence values for the same cells are shown in Fig. 2. Inspection of the results obtained with the mutant in which serines 303 and 304 were converted to alanines showed that O·̄2 production was nearly abolished by these mutations, supporting the idea that the phosphorylation of at least one of these serines is required for oxidase activation. A second double Ser → Ala mutant, p47PHOX S310A/S315A, was fully active, indicating that the mere replacement with alanines of 2 serines in the region of the phosphorylation targets was not enough to abolish the activity of p47PHOX.Figure 2Oxidase activity of phorbol-activated p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing WT and mutant forms of recombinant p47PHOX. Experiments were carried out as described in the text. The results represent peak luminescence by transfected p47PHOX-deficient B cells expressing different forms of p47PHOX. The results are expressed as % of WT control, and are presented as the mean ± 1 S.D. of three or more separate sets of transfections. Peak chemiluminescence for cells expressing the WT protein was 6.2 ± 0.4 Luminoskan units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Further support for this idea was obtained when these two serines were replaced, not with alanines, but with negatively charged residues. One of the effects of serine phosphorylation is the introduction of negative charge in a region of a polypeptide that was originally uncharged. Negative charge can also be introduced by replacing a serine with an aspartate or glutamate residue, and in fact studies on other proteins activated by serine phosphorylation have shown that the replacement of a phosphorylated serine with an aspartate residue can have the same functional consequences as the phosphorylation of that serine (13Hurley J.H. Dean A.M. Sohl J.L. Koshland Jr., D.E. Stroud R.M. Science. 1990; 249: 1012-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether the introduction of negative charge in the vicinity of p47PHOX Ser303-Ser304 had the same effect on oxidase activity as the phosphorylation of serines 303 and 304, we measured O·̄2 production in EBV-transformed B lymphocytes expressing the p47PHOX double mutants S303D/S304D and S303E/S304E. The results showed that, in contrast to the double p47PHOX mutant S303A/S304A, the glutamate mutant was able to support O·̄2production. In cells that expressed p47PHOX S303E/S304E, oxidase activation (Fig. 1) and maximum rates of O·̄2 production (Fig. 2) were both similar to their counterparts in cells transfected with WT p47PHOX. On the other hand, the results obtained with the cells transfected with p47PHOX S303D/S304D were equivocal, not an unexpected outcome given that in steric terms, p47PHOX S303S/S304S-OPO3= is much more similar to p47PHOX S303E/S304E than to p47PHOX S303D/S304D. Replacement of one of the two serines with glutamate and the other with alanine led to p47PHOX mutants that supported O·̄2production to the extent of about 25% of wild-type levels, a finding consistent with earlier work showing that mutants in which one of the two serines was replaced by alanine and the other was left alone were able to support O·̄2 production, but at reduced levels (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the inability of cells transfected with the S303A/S304A mutant to generate O·̄2 is that the EBV-transformed p47PHOX-deficient B cells were unable to express p47PHOX S303A/S304A, the mutant that failed to support O·̄2 production. The findings presented in Fig. 3 and Table II, however, show that all the mutant forms of p47PHOX examined in these experiments were expressed to approximately the same extent as the WT protein. The inability of p47PHOX S303A/S304A to support O·̄2 production therefore could not be attributed to a failure of expression by the transfected cells. A second possible explanation is that, although fully expressed, p47PHOX S303A/S304A could not fold into a native conformation, and was therefore unable to participate in the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase. To investigate this possibility, we examined the ability of the mutant forms of p47PHOX to support O·̄2 production in a cell-free system in which activation was accomplished by an anionic detergent (in this case, SDS), not phosphorylation. Fig. 4 shows that there was little difference in O·̄2 production among cell-free systems containing the various forms of p47PHOX. In particular, the cell-free system that contained p47PHOX S303A/S304A produced O·̄2 at the same rate as the system that contained WT p47PHOX. Therefore the conformation of p47PHOX S303A/S304A was sufficiently similar to the native conformation that the mutant protein functioned normally in the cell-free oxidase activating system, even though it was inactive in whole cells.Table IIExpression of p47PHOX mutants in transfected p47PHOX-deficient B lymphocytes relative to the expression of the wild-type proteinp47PHOXExpression% wild typenWT1006S303A/S304A94.7 ± 4.76S303D/S304D82.8 ± 9.26S303E/S304E72.9 ± 13.54S310A/S315A89.9 ± 5.23S303A/S304E84.6 ± 4.92S303E/S304A92.7 ± 7.82S303K/S304K97.3 ± 6.42 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Oxidase activity in a cell-free oxidase activating system containing WT and mutant forms of recombinant p47PHOX. Assays were carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” Results shown are the differences between luminescence values measured in the absence and presence of 50 units of superoxide dismutase; the latter values never exceeded 5% of the former. The results were calculated from the peak luminescence values observed with each form of p47PHOX, and are shown as % of WT control (mean ± range of duplicate experiments). Control values were 24.5 ± 3.4 Luminoskan units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase is accompanied by the translocation of the oxidase components p47PHOX and p67PHOX from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where they associate with the flavocytochrome b558 (2Heyworth P.G. Curnutte J.T. Nauseef W.M. Volpp B.D. Pearson D.W. Rosen H. Clark R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 14Rotrosen D. Kleinberg M.E. Nunoi H. Leto T. Gallin J.I. Malech H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8745-8750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This association is thought to result at least in part from the appearance of a membrane-binding site on p47PHOX when the oxidase is activated (12Park J.-W. Ma M. Ruedi J.M. Smith R.M. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17327-17332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Nakanishi A. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Fujinawa T. Kikuchi H. Kanegasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19072-19074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We found that when p47PHOX-deficient cells expressing the double mutants p47PHOX S303A/S304A, p47PHOX S303D/S304D, or p47PHOX S303E/S304E were activated with phorbol ester, the mutant p47PHOX polypeptides were transferred to the plasma membrane as efficiently as the WT protein (Fig. 5). The finding that p47PHOX S303A/S304A translocates normally suggests that a negative electrostatic potential in the vicinity of residues 303–304 is not needed for the binding of p47PHOX to the flavocytochrome, although it is required for the enzyme to express its catalytic activity. Besides adding local negative charge to p47PHOX, the phosphorylation of serines 303 and 304 causes a large increase in the polarity of the polypeptide in the vicinity of those residues. To determine whether the effect of phosphorylation on oxidase activity was due to the negative electrostatic potential or the increase in polarity, we examined the activity of the mutant p47PHOX S303K/S304K, in which residues 303 and 304 carry positive, not negative, charges. The translocation of this mutant was normal (Fig. 6), and its activity was normal as well, somewhat to our surprise (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore the function of the Ser303 and Ser304phosphates in the activation of the oxidase must be related to more than simply the acquisition of negative charge by the serine 303–304 region of p47PHOX. In an earlier study of 11 p47PHOX mutants containing an alanine instead of a serine at a single potential phosphorylation site, we found that all but p47PHOX S379A were active when expressed in EBV-transformed p47PHOX-deficient B cells (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, apart from serine 379, no single phosphorylation site appeared to be essential for oxidase activation. As to Ser379, its state of phosphorylation in the activated oxidase is unclear: it became phosphorylated only to a very limited extent when neutrophils were activated, and p47PHOX S379D was no more active than p47PHOX S379A in the p47PHOX-deficient cells. 2L. P. Faust and B. M. Babior, unpublished observation. Consequently, it was not possible to be absolutely certain from those results whether or not the phosphorylation of p47PHOX, either at Ser379 or at any other potential phosphorylation site, was required for the activation of the oxidase. Unlike Ser379, serines 303 and 304 are extensively phosphorylated during oxidase activation (7el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9El Benna J. Faust L.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In earlier work, we found that the oxidase could still be activated if either serines 303 or 304 were converted to alanine (8Faust L.P. El Benna J. Babior B.M. Chanock S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1499-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The present results, however, show that if both of these serines are converted to alanine, the activation of the oxidase is almost completely abolished. These findings provide direct evidence that the phosphorylation of at least one of the serines of p47PHOX, specifically, serines 303 or 304, is necessary for the activation of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase. Our results support similar conclusions drawn from earlier studies showing that p47PHOX is phosphorylated when the oxidase is activated by a variety of stimuli (3Hayakawa T. Suzuki K. Suzuki S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11035-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The effect of the serine-to-alanine mutations is to substitute methyl groups for two of the hydroxymethyl groups known to be phosphorylated during oxidase activation in whole cells (7el Benna J. Faust L.P. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23431-23436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion of these serines to alanines destroyed the activity of p47PHOX. In contrast, the conversion of the same serines to glutamate, a mutation that substituted negatively charged carboxymethyl groups for the two hydroxymethyl groups, gave rise to mutant protein with considerable activity. Since the phosphorylation of other serines in p47PHOX was unaffected by the elimination of serines 303 and 304 (9El Benna J. Faust L.P. Johnson J.L. Babior B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6374-6378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), the simplest explanation for all these findings is that oxidase activation in whole cells requires a negative electrostatic potential in the vicinity of serines 303 and 304 of p47PHOX, and that this potential is generated through the phosphorylation of one or both of those serines. The results with the S303K/S304K mutant, however, indicate that the acquisition of a negative electrostatic potential is not a sufficient explanation. They suggest instead that the purpose of the phosphorylation of Ser303 and Ser304 may be to change the polarity of the protein in the neighborhood of those serines. Alternatively, they may indicate that the phosphates are there to bind divalent metals such as Mg2+, an action that would confer on the serine 303–304 region a net positive charge similar to that in the S303K/S304K mutant. How can these local effects promote the activity of the leukocyte NADPH oxidase? Because the mutants all translocate normally, it is clear that phosphorylation at Ser303-Ser304 is not an obligatory precursor of translocation. In principle, then, phosphorylation at these positions can take place either before or after the translocation of p47PHOX to the membrane. Earlier evidence showing that the final 1 or 2 phosphorylations take place after translocation (6Rotrosen D. Leto T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19910-19915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that at least some p47PHOX is phosphorylated after it is transferred from the cytosol to the membrane. It seems likely that the phosphorylation of Ser303 and Ser304 converts the membrane-bound subunit into a form that is able to render the oxidase catalytically active."
https://openalex.org/W2082557856,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeSgs1 protein is a member of a family of DNA helicases that include the Escherichia coli RecQ protein and the products of human Bloom's syndrome and Werner's syndrome genes. To study the enzymatic characteristics of the protein, a recombinant Sgs1 fragment (amino acids 400–1268 of the 1447-amino acid full-length protein) was overexpressed in yeast and purified to near homogeneity. The purified protein exhibits an ATPase activity in the presence of single- or double-stranded DNA. In the presence of ATP or dATP, unwinding of duplex DNA or a DNA-RNA heteroduplex by the recombinant Sgs1 fragment was readily observed. Similar to the E. coli RecQ helicase, displacement of the DNA strand occurs in the 3′ to 5′ direction with respect to the single-stranded DNA flanking the duplex. The efficiency of unwinding was found to correlate inversely with the length of the duplex region and was enhanced by the presence of E. colisingle-stranded DNA-binding protein. In addition, the recombinant Sgs1 fragment was found to bind more tightly to a forked DNA substrate than to either single- or double-stranded DNA.

The SGS1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiaewas identified in a search for extragenic suppressors of the slow growth phenotype of cells deficient in DNA topoisomerase III, the product of the TOP3 gene (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, whereas null mutations in SGS1 suppress the growth defect oftop3 mutants, they significantly reduce the growth rate oftop1 mutants lacking a functional DNA topoisomerase I (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romeo A.M. Sternglanz R.

Based on the results of two-hybrid screens in yeast (4Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar), it was suggested that Sgs1 protein interacted directly with DNA topoisomerase III (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) and perhaps DNA topoisomerase II as well (5Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Yeastsgs1 mutants show increased genome instability; the rate of mitotic recombination between homologous sequences is elevated (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 5Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D.

Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and chromosome missegregation occurs more frequently during mitosis and meiosis (5Watt P.M. Louis E.J. Borts R.H. Hickson I.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 253-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 6Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J. Genetics. 1996; 144: 935-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These characteristics are reminiscent of those of yeast top3 mutants lacking DNA topoisomerase III; in addition to a slow growth phenotype, top3 mutants show an elevated frequency of recombination between repetitive sequences and are defective in sporulation (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 7Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The hyper-rec phenotype oftop3 mutants is also suppressed by mutations inSGS1 (1Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The sequence of the Sgs1 protein suggests that it possesses a central region homologous to the Escherichia coli RecQ helicase (8Nakayama K. Irino N. Nakayama H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 200: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar,9Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and a helicase activity was detected in a rabbit reticulocyte coupled transcription/translation system expressing the Sgs1 protein (2Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romeo A.M. Sternglanz R. Science. 1996; 383: 678-679Google Scholar). The plausible association between the yeast Sgs1 helicase and DNA topoisomerase III, a member of the type IA subfamily of DNA topoisomerases that also includes E. coli DNA topoisomerases I and III, is reminiscent of an enzyme termed “reverse gyrase,” which was previously found only in thermophilic organisms (for a review, see Ref. 10Duguet M. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 9. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 84-114Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase catalyzes positive supercoiling of DNA, and its sequence suggests that it possesses both a DNA helicase and a type IA DNA topoisomerase (Refs. 11Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5255-5263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; for the classification of DNA topoisomerases, see Ref. 14Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). In the case of the Sulfolobus acidocaldarius enzyme, the putative helicase and the topoisomerase activity are present on the same polypeptide (11Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The association between these activities in a single enzyme led to the proposal that the enzyme acts by using its helicase activity to unwind DNA, generating both positive and negative supercoils; removal of the negative supercoils by the topoisomerase activity then results in a net accumulation of positive supercoils (11Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently, several additional homologues of the E. coli RecQ and yeast Sgs1 protein have been discovered. These include the products of the human Bloom's syndrome and Werner's syndrome genes (BLM and WRN, respectively) (15Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.-Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 16Yu C.-E. Oshima J. Fu Y.-H. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Nakura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D. Science. 1996; 272: 258-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Although the clinical features of the two diseases are rather different, patients of both syndromes exhibit chromosome instability and a predisposition to cancer (for reviews, see Refs. 17Ellis N.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar and 18Lombard D.B. Guarente L. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 283-286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). BLM and WRN proteins are similar to Sgs1 protein in size and share limited sequence homology outside of the central helicase domain, suggesting that these RecQ-type proteins might be functionally related. ASchizosaccharomyces pombe homologue of SGS1, termed rqh1 +, was also reported recently (19Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Similar to SGS1 of the budding yeast,rqh1 + has been shown to suppress recombination, especially during S phase arrest (19Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the E. coli RecQ protein has also been shown to suppress illegitimate recombination (20Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J.-I. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As a first step in studying the mechanistic and functional aspects of the Sgs1 protein, we have purified a truncated form of it containing the helicase domain. We report here the DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities of the purified protein. The regions of the SGS1 gene encoding the N- and C-terminal segments of the protein were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; Ssb, ssDNA-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-[γ-thio]triphosphate; HA, a flu virus hemagglutinin epitope with the amino acid sequence YPYDVP. from pRS414-SGS1 (a gift from Dr. R. Sternglanz, State University of New York at Stony Brook). The N-terminal coding segment was amplified using the VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs) and a pair of oligodeoxynucleotides RB1 (5′-GAGTCTACGGGATCCGTAACCATGGTGACGAAGCCGTC-3′) and RB4 (5′-GGGGATCAAGCTTGCGGCAGTGTACGAGAGC-3′). The sequence of RB1 was designed to place a BamHI site GGATCC (underlined) six base pairs upstream of the ATG initiation codon of SGS1, so that the final construct could be moved into a plasmid previously constructed for the overexpression of several proteins in yeast. The sequence of RB4 was designed to add a HindIII site AAGCTT (underlined) to the end of the N-terminal segment for the convenience of cloning. The C-terminal coding segment of SGS1 was similarly amplified using the primers RB2 and RB5 (5′-GGGGCATAAGCTTCGGCCACGATAGCAGATCT-3′ and 5′-GCTGGACTAGCTCGAGCCTTTCTTCCTCTGTAGTGACC-3′, respectively). RB5 was designed to link the C-terminal codons ofSGS1 to the sequence 5′-CTCGAGGGGTA(CAC)6TAG-3′ in an expression vector pG1TT, via the XhoI site CTCGAG (underlined in both sequences), so that a stretch of six histidines would be added to the C terminus of Sgs1 protein. The expression vector pG1TT 2R. Hanai and J. C. Wang, unpublished results. is a derivative of YEpTOP2-PGAL1, a plasmid originally constructed for the overexpression of yeast DNA topoisomerase II from the inducible GAL1 gene promoter (21Worland S.T. Wang S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal PCR product was cloned between the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of pBluescript (Stratagene) to give pRB104. The C-terminal PCR product was then introduced between the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites of pRB104 to give pRB111. The segment in pRB111 between the AflII site in the N-terminal coding region ofSGS1 and the NarI site in the C-terminal coding region of SGS1 was then replaced by the AflII toNarI fragment from pRS414-SGS1. DNA sequencing confirmed that the resulting plasmid, pRB121, contained the correct wild-typeSGS1 coding region. The BamHI to XhoI segment of pRB121 was placed between the same sites in pG1TT for the expression of full-length Sgs1 protein with a hexahistidine tag at its C terminus. Several constructs expressing truncated SGS1 fragments were derived from pRB121 and tested for overexpression of the encoded proteins. The one used in the work reported here, which expresses a recombinant Sgs1 protein comprised of amino acids 400–1268 of the protein, was produced from pRB121 by PCR through the use of the primer pair RB8 (5′-GAGTCTACGGCGCGCCCGGATGTCGAAAGAG-3′) and RB11 (5′-GCTGGACTACTCGAGCCGAGCGTAAATCGCT-3′). In the PCR product, codons 400–1268 of yeast SGS1 were placed between a BssHII and a XhoI restriction site (underlined) in the primer sequences. The BssHII to XhoI segment was then inserted into pG1TT. The final product, pRB222, is expected to express a recombinant protein MSTDPVYPYDVP-Sgs1-(400–1268)-RRAVH6. Among the extra 12 amino acids at its N terminus, the first six are derived from the N terminus of yeast DNA topoisomerase II and the remaining six comprise the flu virus hemagglutinin epitope (HA), which was introduced into the recombinant protein to facilitate its detection by immunoblotting with a commercially available monoclonal antibody. The hexahistidine tag at the C terminus was added to facilitate the purification of the recombinant protein. pRB222 was first transformed into a protease-deficient yeast strain BCY123 (Ref.22Caron P.R. Watt P. Wang J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar; strain was originally obtained from Dr. R. Kornberg's laboratory, Stanford University). A colony was picked and grown overnight in minimal medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose. This culture was used to inoculate 100 ml of uracil-minus minimal medium lacking glucose. After reaching saturation, the culture was diluted 100-fold into yeast YEP medium supplemented with 2% (w/v) lactic acid and 3% (v/v) glycerol and placed on a platform orbital shaker (New Brunswick) in a 30 °C chamber. When a cell density of approximately 5 × 106 cells/ml was reached, the GAL1 promoter was induced by the addition of galactose to 2% (w/v). Expression of the recombinant protein was allowed to continue for a further 8 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C and 5000 revolutions/min, washed, and then resuspended in an equal volume of buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol) plus 150 mm NaCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm; leupeptin and pepstatin, 2 μg/ml each; benzamidine, 20 μg/ml). Triton X-100 was added to 0.1%, and the cells were lysed by the addition of an equal volume of acid-washed glass beads (Sigma 425–600 μm) and blending in a Bead-beater (Biospec Products). In some preparations, lysis was done by vortexing the mixture vigorously (21Worland S.T. Wang S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell extract was separated from the glass beads and other sediments by decantation, and the beads were washed twice in buffer A. The cell extract and washes were combined and clarified by centrifugation. The crude lysate was loaded directly onto a 60-ml DEAE column equilibrated in buffer A. After washing the column with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted in buffer A plus 300 mmNaCl. The eluate was then applied directly to a 30-ml heparin column equilibrated with buffer A plus 300 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted with a 300-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0.3–1m) in buffer A or, in some preparations, by a 1m NaCl step elution. Fractions containing the truncated Sgs1 protein were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Pooled fractions were diluted with buffer A to a concentration equal to buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl, and imidazole was added to 5 mm. The partially purified protein solution was then mixed with nickel-agarose beads (His-Bind resin, Novagen) to allow the binding of the hexahistidine-tagged protein to the beads. The beads were then washed several times in buffer A containing 0.5 mNaCl and 5 mm imidazole. After a final wash step with buffer A plus 0.5 m NaCl and 23 mm imidazole, the recombinant Sgs1 fragment was eluted in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl and 200 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against a storage buffer (20 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 40% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The final yield of the protein, estimated by the use of a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin solutions as standards, was between 1 and 2.5 mg for several preparations. DNA oligomers (GENEMED) were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis when necessary. The RNA oligomer was purchased from Dalton Chemical Laboratories. Synthetic DNA substrates were prepared from three oligonucleotides 5′-GCCGTGATCACCAATGCAGATTGACGAACCTTTGCCCACGT-3′ (oligonucleotide 1), 5′-GACGTGGGCAAAGGTTCGTCAATGGACTGACAGCTGCATGG-3′ (oligonucleotide 2), and 5′-GCCATGCAGCTGTCAGTCCATTGACGAACCTTTGCCCACGT-3′ (oligonucleotide 3). Oligonucleotides 2 and 3 were annealed to form the 40-base pair double-stranded DNA substrate with a one nucleotide overhang at the 5′-ends, and oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were annealed to form the forked DNA substrate with a double-stranded segment with single-stranded tails at one end (complementary regions in oligonucleotides 1 and 2 are underlined). In each case, oligonucleotide 2 was32P-labeled at its 5′-end, using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotide 2 was also used alone as the single-stranded DNA substrate. DNA substrates for testing helicase activity were constructed by the annealing of a complementary DNA strand with single-stranded φX174 virion DNA. Short strands 26, 52, and 66 nucleotides in length were obtained by synthesis and were labeled at their 5′-ends by treatment with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP or at the 3′-ends by treatment with terminal transferase and α-32P-labeled 3′-dATP. The 52- and 66-mers were complementary to φX174 at nucleotides 130–181 and 5357–36, respectively, and the sequence of the 26-mer DNA was the same as oligonucleotide 9 in Whitby et al. (24Whitby M.C. Vincent S.D. Lloyd R.G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5220-5228Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Longer strands were derived from the 140-base pair AvaII–DraIII and the 558-base pair StuI–AvaII restriction fragments of the double-stranded replicative form of φX174. These fragments were 32P-labeled at their 5′-ends and purified on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. The electroeluted fragments were then denatured and annealed with φX174 virion DNA. Conditions for DNA annealing and purification of the products were described previously (23Tsaneva I.R. Muller B. West S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Single-stranded φX174 virion DNA and supercoiled φX174 replicative form DNA were purchased from New England Biolabs. Relaxation of supercoiled φX174 DNA by vaccinia virus topoisomerase was carried out at 37 °C in 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA. The relaxed DNA was phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated before use. Reactions (20 μl each) were carried out in ATPase buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 30 °C. Each reaction contained 25 nCi of [γ-32P]ATP and the amounts of recombinant Sgs1 protein and DNA specified under “Results.” Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 0.5m EDTA to each, and 1 μl of each reaction was spotted onto CEL 300 PEI/UV254 thin layer chromatography plates (Sigma). The plates were developed in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl, and the amount of ATP hydrolyzed in the reaction mixture was evaluated from the dried plates using a phosphor imager (Fuji). Reactions (20 μl each) contained annealed substrate DNA and were carried out as for the ATPase assay, except 2 mm unlabeled ATP was used. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of a stop buffer (0.5% proteinase K, 100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Products were analyzed either by electrophoresis in 1% agarose (in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) or polyacrylamide (in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA). Agarose gels were dried on Whatman DE81 paper, and polyacrylamide gels were dried on Whatman 3MM paper. The dried gels were analyzed using a phosphor imager (Fuji). DNA concentrations refer to that of the φX174 virion DNA in nucleotides. The E. coli single-stranded DNA binding protein (Ssb) used in some of the helicase assays was purchased from Promega. To examine the binding of the recombinant Sgs1 fragment to either single-stranded or supercoiled replicative form φX174 DNA, the indicated amounts of protein and DNA were incubated in 20 μl of DNA binding buffer (20 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min, and the DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA. DNA and DNA-protein complexes were visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To compare the binding of Sgs1 with single-stranded, double-stranded, or forked DNA, binding reactions (20 μl) containing32P-labeled DNA (0.1 μm) and recombinant Sgs1 were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min in the DNA binding buffer. Products were assayed by electrophoresis in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA. Gels were dried, and the DNA was visualized using a phosphor imager (Fuji). Initial attempts to purify full-length Sgs1 protein were unsuccessful because of the insolubility of the protein when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae. To circumvent this problem, three plasmids were constructed for the overexpression of truncated proteins from an inducible yeast GAL1 gene promoter. One plasmid was designed for expressing amino acid residues 1–1119, a second for amino acids 400–1268, and a third for amino acids 400–1447. Cells bearing the construct for the expression of Sgs1-(1–1119) yielded an insoluble protein that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Expression of the other truncations yielded soluble products that migrated with apparent molecular masses of 125 and 140 kDa, respectively, with the solubility of Sgs1-(400–1268) substantially higher than that of Sgs1-(400–1447). Because of its higher solubility, the Sgs1-(400–1268) fragment was chosen for further studies. In the plasmid constructed for the expression of this fragment, pRB222, codons for MSTDPVYPYDVP-(amino acids 400–1268 of Sgs1)-RRAVH6 were placed downstream of a plasmid-borne inducible promoter of the yeast GAL1 gene. Codons for two peptide motifs, a hexapeptide epitope YPYDVP of flu virus HA and a stretch of six histidines, were added to the 5′- and 3′-end of the SGS1 sequence, respectively, to facilitate the detection and purification of the recombinant protein product (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Cells of a protease-deficient S. cerevisiae strain were transformed with pRB222. Pilot experiments showed that when the transformed cells were grown and induced with galactose, a 125-kDa protein was overexpressed (Fig. 1 C, lane b). Immunoblotting with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody confirmed that the overexpressed protein was the desired product (data not shown). Large scale preparations of the recombinant protein were then carried out, and the protein was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 C,lanes c–h). The purified recombinant Sgs1 fragment was tested for its ability to hydrolyze ATP in the presence and absence of DNA. As shown in Fig. 2, a DNA-dependent ATPase activity was readily detected. This activity co-purified with the peak of the recombinant Sgs1 protein when eluted from a heparin column (data not shown). Hydrolysis of ATP was equally efficient in the presence of several different DNA cofactors, including either single- or double-stranded DNA (Fig. 2). In contrast, for the E. coliRecQ ATPase, it was previously shown that single-stranded DNA was a much more effective cofactor than double-stranded DNA (9Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The slope of the beginning part of the plot shown in Fig. 2 corresponds to a rate of hydrolysis of approximately 10 ATP/s Sgs1 monomers. The DNA binding activity of the purified recombinant protein was investigated using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3). The Sgs1 fragment was found to bind single-stranded circular φX174 DNA (ssDNA), since the presence of increasing amounts of the protein progressively reduced the gel electrophoretic mobility of the DNA (Fig. 3, lanes a–f). Binding of the protein to supercoiled φX174 appeared to be less efficient, and retardation of the DNA was observed only at the highest concentration of the recombinant protein used (lane l). The stable binding of the Sgs1 fragment to ssDNA did not require Mg(II) or nucleotide cofactors (data not shown). To test the possibility that binding to the single-stranded DNA might be facilitated by secondary structures within it, Sgs1 binding to a synthetic duplex DNA with single-stranded tails at one end (the forked DNA substrate) was examined. The forked DNA was prepared by the annealing of two partially complementary oligonucleotides, 41 nucleotides in length. It was found that incubation of32P-labeled forked DNA with the Sgs1 fragment resulted in the formation of a stable protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4, lanes k–o), as detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under the same conditions, only very weak binding to either a single-stranded oligonucleotide (lanes a–e) or duplex DNA (lanes f–j) was observed. To test for DNA helicase activity of the recombinant protein, we examined whether it could displace a 52-nucleotide 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotide from single-stranded circular φX174 DNA. The Sgs1 fragment was found to effect the dissociation of the oligonucleotide from the single-stranded DNA ring in the presence of ATP and Mg(II) (Fig. 5, lanes c–g, and lanes h and i). Optimal activity occurred at a molar ratio of ATP to Mg(II) of 1:1 (data not shown). No activity was observed when ATP was replaced by the presumably nonhydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS (lane k). Furthermore, in the presence of 2 mm ATP, the addition of 1 mmATPγS to the reaction was found to significantly inhibit the unwinding activity (lane l). ATP could be replaced by dATP (lane m), but other common nucleotide triphosphates (e.g. GTP, TTP, and UTP) could not support DNA unwinding by the Sgs1 fragment (data not shown). These cofactor requirements are similar to those observed in the RecQ-mediated unwinding of DNA (9Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Similar to the case of E. coli RecQ, the addition of Zn(II), but not Mn(II) or Ca(II), significantly inhibited the unwinding reaction (9Umezu K. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5363-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). A time course of the Sgs1-mediated strand displacement reaction is shown in Fig. 6. Over 50% of the labeled fragment was displaced within 5 min, and the reaction was close to completion within 10 min. The DNA unwinding activity was very sensitive to the salt concentration (NaCl or potassium acetate) in the reaction buffer. There was a 50% decrease in the unwinding activity at a salt concentration between 30 and 40 mm; at 100 mmsalt, the helicase activity was less than 10% of that seen in the low salt assay mixture (data not shown). The recombinant Sgs1 fragment was also tested for its ability to unwind a DNA-RNA hybrid. A 26-nucleotide 32P-labeled RNA or DNA oligomer was annealed to φX174 virion DNA and incubated with the recombinant Sgs1 fragment in the presence of Mg(II) and ATP. Displacement of the oligoribonucleotide by the protein occurred with an efficiency similar to that of the oligodeoxynucleotide (data not shown). Like the DNA-DNA helicase activity, unwinding of the DNA-RNA hybrid was driven by the hydrolysis of ATP or dATP but not the other common nucleoside triphosphates (data not shown). To determine the polarity of the helicase activity, the DNA substrates shown in Fig. 7 A were used. These substrates were made by first annealing a 5′- or 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotide (66 nucleotides in length) with φX174 ssDNA. The duplex region of each was then cut by PstI restriction endonuclease to yield a linear ssDNA with either a labeled complementary 40-mer or a labeled 26-mer bound to one of its ends. The recombinant Sgs1 fragment was found to efficiently displace the 5′-labeled 40-mer (substrate I; Fig. 7 B). In contrast, unwinding and dissociation of the 3′-labeled 26-mer by the protein was much less efficient (substrate II; Fig. 7 B). The annealed 26-mer was not refractory to unwinding because of its sequence, since the original 66-mer was displaced with an efficiency close to that of the 40-mer (data no"

The central issue is whether PHF formation itself causes or accelerates the neuronal perikaryal and neuritic degeneration or whether they are simply the consequence of preceding degeneration. We sought to address the issue in part by characterizing the PHF-associated molecules and thus raised a number of monoclonal antibodies to neurofibrillary tangles. One monoclonal antibody, 3F4, strongly reacted with neurofibrillary tangles and some plaque neurites but few neuropil threads. This monoclonal antibody labeled a 65-kDa protein, but not tau or ubiquitin, on a Western blot of human brain extract and immunoprecipitated the same protein. The peptides released from the purified 65-kDa protein had the same sequences as those of a newly identified protein, human collapsin response mediator protein-2. Incorporation into neurofibrillary tangles may deplete soluble, cytosolic human collapsin response mediator protein-2 and lead to abnormal neuritic and/or axonal outgrowth of the tangle-bearing neuron, thus accelerating the neuritic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.

Paired helical filaments (PHF) 1The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filaments; AD, Alzheimer's disease; API, A. lyticusprotease I; CRMP, collapsin response mediator protein; hCRMP, human CRMP; NFT, neurofibrillary tangles; PVDF, polyvinylidenedifluoride; TS, Tris saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filaments; AD, Alzheimer's disease; API, A. lyticusprotease I; CRMP, collapsin response mediator protein; hCRMP, human CRMP; NFT, neurofibrillary tangles; PVDF, polyvinylidenedifluoride; TS, Tris saline; mAb, monoclonal antibody; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. are unit fibrils of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in neuronal perikarya that often surround the nucleus and run into the proximal portion of apical dendrites. Much smaller bundles of PHF or individual fibrils are also found mostly in dendrites as neuropil threads (curly fibers) and in a fraction of dystrophic neurites surrounding senile plaques (senile plaque neurites or dystrophic neurites); all of these constitute one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Accumulating evidence suggests that senile plaque neurites are derived mainly from axon terminals (1Probst A. Bron V.B. Ulrich J. Brain Res. 1983; 268: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2Masliah E. Mallory M. Hansen L. Alford M. DeTeresa R. Terry R.D. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 142: 871-882PubMed Google Scholar), whereas neuropil threads are derived largely from dendrites (3Braak H. Braak E. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurol. 1988; 14: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 4Ihara Y. Brain Res. 1988; 459: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 5Yamaguchi H. Nakazato Y. Shoji M. Ihara Y.

Neurol. 1992; 51: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In either case, PHF are always associated with degenerating neuronal perikarya and their processes. The current central issue therefore is whether PHF formation itself causes the neuronal perikaryal and neuritic degeneration or whether they are simply the consequence of preceding degeneration. One approach to the issue is complete characterization of hyperphosphorylated tau (PHF-tau), a building block of PHF (7Lee V.M.-Y. Balin B.J. Otovus Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q. Science. 1991; 251: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). In contrast to normal tau that promotes tubulin assembly into microtubules, PHF-tau is assembly-incompetent (8Bramblett G.T. Goedert M. Jakes R. Merrick S.E. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1089-1099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 9Yoshida H. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 81: 1183-1186Crossref Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and may destabilize microtubules. In fact, some investigators claim that PHF-tau even induces disassembly of microtubules (10Alonso A.D.C. Zaidi T. Grundke-Iqbal I. Iqbal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5562-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). This may be seemingly consistent with the morphological observations made to date: if PHF are present in a given affected neuronal process, there are no normal cytoskeletons including microtubules and neurofilaments (11Perry G. Kawai M. Tabaton M. Ororato M. Mulvihill P. Richey P. Morandi A. Connolly J.A. Gambetti P. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Iwatsubo T. Hasegawa M. Ezaki Y. Ihara Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 277-282PubMed Google Scholar). However, the weak point of the hypothesis is that there is no definitive evidence for the presence of cytosolic PHF-tau that should destabilize microtubules; PHF-tau is always recovered in the detergent-insoluble fraction. This may be because cytosolic PHF-tau is rapidly dephosphorylated during the post mortem (13Matsuo E.S. Shin R.-W. Billingsley M.L. Van deVoorde A. O'Connor M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.-Y. Neuron. 1994; 13: 989-1002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). We took a different approach to the issue: to search for a particular PHF-associated molecule that should provide insight into the microenvironmental alterations in NFT-bearing neurons (14Hasegawa M. Arai T. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 15Morishima-Kawashima M. Arai T. Ogawara M. Takio K. Titani K. Saitoh T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. Brain Res. 1991; 554: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For this purpose we raised a number of monoclonal antibodies against crude PHF and determined whether as yet unidentified molecules are associated with PHF. We obtained one monoclonal antibody (mAb), 3F4, which did not label tau but a 65-kDa protein in the soluble fraction of human brain. Sequencing and mass spectrometric analyses of the 65-kDa protein revealed that it is human collapsin response mediator protein-2 (hCRMP-2), a human homologue of CRMP-62 that was originally identified in chick brain (16Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). The protein is assumed to be involved in mediating an intracellular response to collapsin through a signal transduction cascade involving G protein (17Igarashi M. Strittmatter S.M. Vartanian T. Fishman M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and has significant homology with a product of unc-33, the mutation of which results in abnormal outgrowth of axons, leading to the severe incoordination ofCaenorhabditis elegans (18Hedgecock E.M.

Unless otherwise indicated, all reagents were obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Trizma base, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, alkaline phosphatase (Escherichia coli, type III), Nonidet P-40, and polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 were obtained from Sigma. Culture medium and supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Antipain, pepstatin, and leupeptin were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). The Affi-gel Hz Immunoaffinity kit, protein assay kit, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody were obtained from Bio-Rad. Frozen AD cortices were homogenized in 10 volumes of Tris-saline (TS; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15m NaCl) containing 0.32 m sucrose, 0.5m NaCl, and protease inhibitors (1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/mlN α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, for 30 min at 4 °C in a refrigerated centrifuge (himac CR 20B2, Hitachi, Ibaraki, Japan). The obtained supernatant was supplemented with Sarkosyl powder to final concentration of 1% and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 543,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant pellets (Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction; Sarkosyl PHF) were suspended in TS buffer, and the densities of the suspensions were adjusted to 1.3 g/ml by addition of CsCl. CsCl-isopycnic density gradient centrifugation was performed on a TLN100 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) at 365,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. This centrifugation gave a density gradient from 1.23 to 1.37 g/ml. Fractions (0.5 ml) were removed with a 1-ml syringe from the top to the bottom of the tube (fractions 1–8), and after dilution with 2 volumes of TS, each fraction was centrifuged at 543,000 × g, for 30 min at 4 °C. Each of the pellets was solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidenedifluoride (PVDF; Immobilon, Nihon Millipore Ltd, Yonezawa, Japan) membrane and subjected to Western blotting with Alz50, AT8, C5, or 3F4 (see below). Monoclonal antibodies were raised against the high density (“heavy”) PHF fraction (fraction 3). 20 μg of the heavy PHF fraction in Freund's complete adjuvant containing 0.1% Sarkosyl was injected into the footpads of BALB/C mice. These mice were boosted with another 20 μg of immunogen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant containing 0.1% Sarkosyl on days 4, 7, and 12. On day 14, regional lymph nodes were removed, and the cells were fused with myeloma cells (line PAI, a gift of Dr. T. Arai) using polyethylene glycol 4000 (Merck). After the selection by resistance to hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium in RPMI 1640 medium, the hybridoma cells of interest were selected by the staining of isolated tangles and then cloned. Seven peptides synthesized according to the sequence of hCRMP-2 (Ref.16Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar; see Fig. 6) were conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin at their carboxyl termini, except for one peptide A661 (see Fig. 6). Each New Zealand White rabbit was immunized with 1 mg of each of the peptides in Freund's complete adjuvant containing 0.1% SDS and boosted with 0.5 mg of each peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant containing 0.1% SDS four to five times at 2-week intervals 4 weeks following the first immunization. Titers of the antisera were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in which a plate was coated with 1 μg/ml of each (unconjugated) peptide. Other antibodies used for this study were AT8 (epitope: phosphorylated Ser-202/Thr-205; Ref. 21Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 189: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar; the numbering follows that of the 441-residue isoform of human tau), C5 (phosphorylated Ser-396; Ref. 22Hasegawa M. Watanabe A.

Res. 1997; 48: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and anti-tau (residues 68–73 and 103–130 of human tau; Ref. 26Ihara Y. Kondo J. Miura R. Nakagawa Y. Mori H. Honda T. Gerontology. 1990; 35: 15-24Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). AT8 was obtained from Innogenetics (Zwijndrecht, Belgium), and Alz50 was a gift of Dr. Peter Davies. Immunocytochemical staining was performed using isolated tangles, paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm), or vibratome sections (50 μm). Isolated tangles were prepared from AD cortices, as described previously (27Ihara Y. Abraham C. Selkoe D.S. Nature. 1983; 304: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). For preparation of vibratome sections, a small block from an AD temporal cortex was fixed in phosphate-buffered 4% formaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. Each specimen, after blocking with 4% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline, was immunostained with each antibody appropriately diluted in 10% calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline by the avidin-biotin method using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Small pieces from AD cortex were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. 50-μm-thick vibratome sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum for 12 h, followed by incubation with 3F4 at 4 °C for 24 h. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the sections were incubated with horse anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 12 h, followed by exposure to diaminobenzidine/H2O2 for 2 min. The floated sections were postfixed with 1% OsO4 for 1 h and embedded in epoxy resin. The specimens without heavy metal staining were examined in a JOEL1200EX electron microscope at 90 kV. The TS-soluble fraction from human brain was concentrated by ammonium sulfate fractionation (33–50% saturated) and mixed with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The supernatant unbound to protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was incubated with 3F4 or anti-tau at 4 °C overnight, and a 110volume of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was added to each mixture. The precipitates were washed with RIPA buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) three times and were boiled for 5 min in Laemmli's sample buffer. Equal amounts of aliquots were run on a 10% acrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting with 3F4 or anti-tau. 1 ml of ascites was obtained by intraperitoneal administration of 3F4 hybridoma to pristane-primed mice and was loaded on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. The purified antibodies were oxidized in 25 mg/1.2 ml of NaIO4for 1 h at room temperature and were conjugated to 2 ml of Affi-Gel Hz at room temperature for 16 h. After replacing the buffer with TS containing protease inhibitors, the conjugated resin was packed in a column (3F4 column). The TS-soluble fraction prepared from human brain was applied to the 3F4 column, which was extensively washed with TS. The 3F4 antigen was eluted from the column with 1.0m MgCl2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 (28Sato-Yoshitake R. Shiomura Y. Miyasaka H. Hirokawa N. Neuron. 1989; 3: 229-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The purified fractions were dialyzed against TS and used for subsequent experiments. The immunoaffinity-purified antigen was electrotransferred to PVDF membrane after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The major band was excised from the membrane and blocked with 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone-40 in methanol (29Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherto D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), followed by digestion with API (Achromobacter lyticusprotease I, a gift of Dr. K. Takio) in a 1:50 enzyme-substrate ratio at 37 °C overnight (22Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The digest was separated by reverse-phase HPLC (Hewlett-Packard model 1090M, Waldbronn, Germany) on a Superspher Select B column (2 × 119 mm, Merck) with a linear gradient of 0–48% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 24 min at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The peptides represented by numbered peaks in the profile (see Fig. 6) were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer (Foster, CA) and were also subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Voyager, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Based on the obtained amino acid sequences and mass numbers, we searched data bases for a particular protein containing these sequences. The specimens consisted of the temporal or frontal cortices from 37 control cases (59–99 years of age) and 24 AD cases (63–87 years of age). AD was both clinically and pathologically diagnosed; the criteria met A2 according to the criteria established by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's and Related Disorders Association (30Tierney M.C. Fisher H. Lewis A.J. Neurology. 1988; 38: 356-364Crossref Google Scholar), and AD cases here were classified as type C defined by the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (31Mirra S.S. Heyman A. Mckee D. Neurology. 1991; 42: 1681-1688Google Scholar). Aliquots of TS-soluble fraction from the temporal or frontal cortices of the above cases were run on a 10% SDS gel and subjected to Western blotting with 3F4 using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensity of the 65-kDa band was quantitated using one specimen as a standard with a model GS-700 imaging densitometer on Molecular Analyst® Software (Bio-Rad). In this experiment, 2, 5, 10, and 15 μl of aliquots of the ammonium sulfate (33–50%)-concentrated fraction from the authentic specimen were used as a standard. One arbitrary unit is defined as the ECL signal resulting from use of 5 μl of the specimen. The standard was linear in this range (2–15 μl of the standard aliquots). Each TS-soluble specimen was diluted 1:5, 1:3, 2:3, or 1:1 and subjected to Western blotting in conjugation with the standard specimens. Rat brains at embryonic days 13 and 19, postnatal day 1, and postnatal weeks 1, 2, 4, and 10 and several organs apart from brain, including heart, thymus, spleen, liver, and kidney were homogenized in 4 volumes of TS buffer containing protease inhibitors. After high speed centrifugation at 543,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were obtained, and small aliquots (20 μg of protein) of them were subjected to Western blotting. Alkaline phosphatase treatment was performed with alkaline phosphatase (10 units/ml) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, containing protease inhibitors with or without 0.1 m sodium phosphate at 37 °C for 2 h. After the treatment, the reaction mixture was concentrated by ammonium sulfate fractionation (33–50%) and was subjected to Western blotting. Protein assay was performed using bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) or Bio-Rad protein assay kit using bovine serum albumin as a standard. It was previously shown that two distinct PHF fractions were separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (32Ksiezak-Reding H. Morgan K. Dickson D.W. Brain Res. 1994; 649: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Ksiezak-Reding H. Wall J.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). One fraction consisted mostly of short and nonaggregated PHF, the majority of which are readily soluble in SDS, and the other contained primarily aggregated PHF in bundles, which are less soluble in SDS. We similarly fractionated crude PHF (Sarkosyl-PHF) by CsCl isopycnic density gradient centrifugation and obtained two distinct PHF fractions; one is “light” PHF in fraction 1 at a density of 1.23 g/ml, and the other is heavy PHF in fraction 3 at a density of 1.3 g/ml (Fig. 1). Because most proteins were recovered in fraction 1, the heavy PHF fraction was very pure (Fig. 1 A). These fractions were tested for their reactivities to several well characterized monoclonal antibodies, Alz50 (epitope: residues 1–10; Ref. 23Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 126: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, see also Refs. 24Carmel G. Mager E.M. Binder L.I. Kuret J. J. Biol.

Res. 1997; 48: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), AT8 (phosphorylated Ser-202/Thr-205; Ref. 21Goedert M. Jakes R. Vanmechelen E. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 189: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and C5 (phosphorylated Ser-396; Ref. 22Hasegawa M. Watanabe A. Takio K. Suzuki M. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2068-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Light PHF are characterized by loss of Alz50 immunoreactivity and smear staining especially with C5 (Fig. 1,B and C). In contrast, heavy PHF are characterized by much less extents of smears and by the presence of discrete, often triplet, bands exhibiting Alz50 reactivity on Western blots (Fig. 1 B). Thus heavy PHF are exclusively composed of hyperphosphorylated full-length tau, whereas light PHF are composed of more processed tau (data not shown). These results indicate that heavy PHF are less processed and so can be regarded as “younger” ones. We used heavy PHF as an immunogen to raise monoclonal antibodies because they are pure to a much greater extent than light PHF. Primary screening for positive clones was based on the staining of isolated (nondenaturing) tangles (27Ihara Y. Abraham C. Selkoe D.S. Nature. 1983; 304: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and the secondary screening was based on the reactivities of hybridoma media with fetal rat tau, which is known to be highly phosphorylated at sites similar to those phosphorylated in PHF-tau (34Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Morishima-Kawashima M.

Although most positive clones reacted with phosphorylated tau or microtubule-associated protein 1B, one mAb, 3F4, was found to have no reactivity with phosphorylated tau on the Western blot. On the tissue section, 3F4 intensely reacted with NFT and occasionally with senile plaque neurites but very slightly with neuropil threads, whereas AT8 reacted with NFT, senile plaque neurites, and innumerable neuropil threads (Figs.2, A and B). By comparing tau- and 3F4-stained serial sections, we thought that most of intracellular tangles appear to be labeled by 3F4. Immunoelectron microscopy showed that 3F4 decorates twisted (PHF-like) and straight tubules in perikaryal tangles (Fig. 2 C). We analyzed human brain extract for the presence of the 3F4 antigen by Western blotting. TS-soluble and Sarkosyl-insoluble fractions were prepared from aged control and AD brains. mAb3F4 labeled a major band at 65 kDa on the blot of the TS-soluble fraction from both control (Fig. 3, left) and AD brains (see Fig. 8 A) and weakly stained a smear on the blot of Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction only from AD brains (data not shown; see also Fig. 1 D). On the other hand, tau was detected on the Western blots of TS-soluble fractions from both control (Fig. 3,left) and AD brains, whereas tau with a slower mobility on the blot (PHF-tau) was found in the Sarkosyl-insoluble fraction only from AD brain (data not shown). These observations indicate that the 3F4 antigen is normally recovered in the soluble fraction from control and AD brains, and a substantial fraction of it is insoluble in AD brain, presumably due to its tight association with PHF. When CsCl centrifugation-separated fractions were probed with 3F4 on Western blots, no discrete bands but ill defined bands or smears were observed; fraction 1 showed a much stronger immunoreactivity than fraction 3 (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the 3F4 antigen was abundant in fraction 1, although the heavy PHF in fraction 3 were used for immunization.Figure 8The levels of 3F4 antigen in control and AD brains. Equal amounts of TS-soluble fractions from control and AD brains were subjected to Western blotting with 3F4 using an ECL system (A). The relative intensity of the 65-kDa band was quantitated using a model GS-700 imaging densitometer with Molecular Analyst® Software (Bio-Rad). The levels of the 65-kDa protein in TS-soluble fractions from 20 AD and 15 control cases were plotted (B). The mean levels are statistically significant between control and AD brains (p < 0.005, two-tailed Student's t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further characterize the 3F4 antigen, we immunoprecipitated the antigen with 3F4 using the TS-soluble fraction from human control aged brain. mAb3F4 precipitated the 65-kDa protein that is labeled with 3F4 but not with anti-tau, whereas anti-tau precipitated tau that is labeled with anti-tau but not with 3F4 (Fig. 4 A). This result clearly indicates that the 65-kDa protein is distinct from tau. In addition, the 65-kDa protein was heat- and acid-labile and did not bind to the phosphocellulose column, properties incompatible with those of tau (data not shown). Previous studies showed that several phosphorylation-dependent antibodies labeled NFT, and phosphorylated species may be characteristic of NFT-associated proteins (14Hasegawa M. Arai T. Ihara Y. Neuron. 1990; 4: 909-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined the effect of alkaline phosphatase treatment on 3F4 immunoreactivity. The 65-kDa protein immunoaffinity-purified from the human brain soluble fraction (see below) was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase. After the treatment, the 3F4-reactive band migrated faster on the gel (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the 65-kDa protein is a phosphoprotein and mAb3F4 is a phosphorylation-independent antibody. To obtain more information about the 65-kDa protein, we investigated its expression levels in rat brains at various ages and in various organs apart from the brain. First, we determined its expression in brain during development from embryonic day 13 to postnatal week 10. The 65-kDa protein was detectable from embryonic day 19, reaching a peak at postnatal weeks 1–2, and became barely detectable at postnatal week 10 (Fig. 5 A). Initially the 3F4-reactive protein appeared as doublets at embryonic day 19 and postnatal day 1, and the upper band predominated the lower one, disappearing at postnatal week 1 (Fig. 5 A). We next determined the level of expression of the 3F4 antigen in various organs from rat at postnatal week 2, when the 3F4 antigen expression in the brain had peaked. TS-soluble fractions from various organs including the brain, heart, thymus, spleen, liver, and kidney, were subjected to Western blotting with 3F4. The 65-kDa protein was found only in brain (Fig. 5 B). These results indicate that the 65-kDa protein is brain-specific and its expression level is high during neonatal periods. We purified the 65-kDa protein by immunoaffinity chromatography (see above). Unexpectedly, two major bands at 65 and 60 kDa, roughly at the same stoichiometry, were observed upon CBB staining of the Western blot, but only the upper band was 3F4-reactive (Fig. 4 B). The 3F4-reactive band was carefully excised and digested with API. The digest was separated by reverse-phase HPLC. Peptides represented by numbered peaks in the profile (Fig. 6) were subjected to protein sequencing on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (PerSeptive). Five peaks provided five distinct amino acid sequences (Fig. 6) and corresponding mass numbers (data not shown). All of the obtained sequences and mass numbers were found in the sequence of a newly identified protein, hCRMP-2, a human homologue of chick CRMP-62 (16Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). We similarly analyzed the peptides released from a digest of the protein represented by the lower (3F4-nonreactive) band for their mass numbers. Most interestingly, the HPLC profile for API peptides from this protein was very similar to that from the upper (3F4-reac"

We are studying ER-associated degradation using a truncated variant of the rough ER-specific type I transmembrane glycoprotein, ribophorin I. The truncated polypeptide (RI332) consists of only the 332 amino-terminal amino acids of the protein corresponding to most of its luminal domain and, in contrast to the long-lived endogenous ribophorin I, is rapidly degraded.Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the destruction of the truncated ribophorin I. Thus, when RI332that itself appears to be a substrate for ubiquitination was expressed in a mutant hamster cell line harboring a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 affecting ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, the protein is dramatically stabilized at the restrictive temperature. Moreover, inhibitors of proteasome function effectively block the degradation of RI332. Cell fractionation experiments indicate that RI332 accumulates in the cytosol when degradation is prevented by proteasome inhibitors but remains associated with the lumen of the ER under ubiquitination-deficient conditions, suggesting that the release of the protein into the cytosol is ubiquitination-dependent. Accordingly, when ubiquitination is impaired, a considerable amount of RI332 binds to the ER chaperone calnexin and to the Sec61 complex that could effect retro-translocation of the polypeptide to the cytosol. Before proteolysis of RI332, its N-linked oligosaccharide is cleaved in two distinct steps, the first of which might occur when the protein is still associated with the ER, as the trimmed glycoprotein intermediate efficiently interacts with calnexin and Sec61.From our data we conclude that the steps that lead a newly synthesized luminal ER glycoprotein to degradation by the proteasome are tightly coupled and that especially ubiquitination plays a crucial role in the retro-translocation of the substrate protein for proteolysis to the cytosol.

Most proteins of the endomembrane system as well as plasma membrane and secretory proteins are synthesized on polysomes bound to the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum. During and shortly after their synthesis, the ectodomains of these polypeptides assume their three-dimensional conformation in the lumen of the ER, 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALLN,N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin; BFA, brefeldin A; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CPY*, a mutant form of carboxypeptidase Y; endo H, endoglycosidase H; leupeptin, acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-argininal; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RI332, a truncated form of ribophorin I containing its 332 NH2-terminal amino acids; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell antigen receptor; TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TPCK,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; ZLLL, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; ZLLNva, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norvalinal. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ALLN,N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; α1-AT, α1-antitrypsin; BFA, brefeldin A; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CPY*, a mutant form of carboxypeptidase Y; endo H, endoglycosidase H; leupeptin, acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-argininal; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; RI332, a truncated form of ribophorin I containing its 332 NH2-terminal amino acids; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; TCR, T cell antigen receptor; TLCK,N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone; TPCK,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; ZLLL, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal; ZLLNva, carbobenzoxy-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norvalinal. and the proteins may then also become part of oligomeric complexes. The ER houses an efficient “quality control system” to ensure that transport out of this organelle is limited to properly folded and assembled proteins (1Rose J.K. Doms R.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,2Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 227-307Crossref Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Proteins that fail to assume their correct final conformation in the lumen of the ER, in most cases, do not stably remain in this compartment, rather they are degraded by a proteolytic system (3Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar,4Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin.

An increasing number of diseases characterized by an “ER storage phenotype” results from impaired quality control of the ER (5Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). For instance, it has been observed that in most cases of cystic fibrosis, mutated forms of the transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) are not expressed at the cell membrane but are retained and degraded in the ER or a related compartment (6Jensen T.J.

Similarly, α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency patients with the Z mutation in α1-AT accumulate the mutant protein in the ER of hepatocytes (8Le A. Graham K.S. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar, 11Esser V. Russell D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 21376-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are also related to impaired transport out of the ER. The process, and possibly the mechanism(s) involved, of ER-associated degradation appears to be highly conserved in eukaryotes, as this phenomenon has also been observed in yeast (13Finger A. Knop M. Wolf D.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14McCracken A.A. Kruse K.B. Mol. Biol.

In several cases it has been shown that substrate proteins for ER-associated degradation interact with chaperones present in the ER, which thus might be involved in the quality control process that leads to targeting of those proteins for degradation. For instance, the binding of CFTR (16Pind S. Riordan J.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12784-12788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the PiZ variant of α1-AT (9Qu D.

Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7514-7519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to calnexin, a chaperone that recognizes glycoproteins in their mono-glucosylated forms in the ER (18Bergeron J.J.M. Brenner M.B. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 123-128Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 19Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), has clearly been demonstrated. Furthermore, BiP that has been shown to bind to a variety of folding intermediates in the lumen of the ER could also represent a candidate protein that interacts with misfolded polypeptides that eventually are delivered for proteolysis. In fact, it appears that the time of interaction of a substrate protein with BiP correlates with its half-life (20Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Leitzgen K. Knittler M.R. Haas I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3117-3123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The major pathways of protein degradation in the eukaryotic cell include lysosomal proteolysis, ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal proteolysis, ubiquitin-independent proteasomal proteolysis, and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal proteolysis (22Dice J.F. FASEB J. 1987; 1: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 23Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 24Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar). The latter plays a pivotal role in the rapid turnover of abnormal proteins and in the regulation of the steady state of a variety of proteins that include cyclins, kinases, tumor suppressors, and transcriptional regulators (23Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar, 24Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar, 25Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). In this case, ubiquitin, a small polypeptide of 76 amino acids, is activated by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in a reaction that requires ATP hydrolysis. The activated ubiquitin molecule is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) that catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the COOH-terminal glycine of ubiquitin and the ε-amino group of a lysine residue on target proteins. The mono-ubiquitinated substrates then undergo further ubiquitinations via the lysine residue at position 48 of ubiquitin, leading to the formation of multi-ubiquitin chains that target proteins to degradation by the 26 S proteasome (23Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar,24Smith S.E. Koegl M. Jentsch S. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 437-446PubMed Google Scholar). In recent years it has become clear that soluble and integral membrane proteins that have been targeted to the ER are, in fact, degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. By using a genetic approach, Hilleret al. (26Hiller M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) provided evidence that the degradation of a variant of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY*) that is retained in the ER of yeast depends on the activity of Ubc6p, an ER-bound ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, as well as functional proteasomes. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that retrograde transport of CPY* from the ER to the cytosol depends on ubiquitination, in which a complex is involved that consists of the two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ubc6p and Ubc7p, and Cue1p, an ER transmembrane protein required for the recruitment of Ubc7p to the ER membrane (27Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Moreover, Wiertz et al. (28Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) observed an interaction between MHC class I heavy chain molecules and Sec 61, suggesting that retrograde transport of substrate proteins to the cytosol may occur through the translocation channel. This view was strengthened by the recent finding that certain mutant yeast Sec61 alleles are defective in the export out of the ER of substrate proteins for degradation (29Pilon M. Schekman R. Römisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 30Plemper R.K. Böhmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H. Nature. 1997; 388: 891-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). We are studying ER-associated degradation using a COOH-terminally truncated variant of ribophorin I, a type I ER transmembrane glycoprotein that is a component of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (31Crimaudo C. Hortsch M. Gausepohl H. Meyer D.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Harnik-Ort V. Prakasch K. Marcantonio E. Colman D.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D.

Cell. 1992; 69: 55-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). When the mutant protein, RI332, that contains only the NH2-terminal 332 amino acids of the luminal domain of ribophorin I is expressed in permanent transformants of HeLa cells, it is rapidly degraded by a non-lysosomal pathway with biphasic kinetics. The first phase of degradation is characterized by a half-life of about 1 h and is followed, after approximately 45 min, by a second phase of 3-fold accelerated degradation. In contrast, endogenous ribophorin I is very stable and has a half-life of more than 24 h (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 35Ivessa N.E. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Tsao Y.-S. Takatsuki A. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 949-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Here we show that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the degradation of RI332 and that, in fact, release to the cytosol of the substrate protein for degradation and ubiquitination are tightly coupled.

The transfected E36-RI332 and ts20-RI332 cell cultures were grown in 35-mm dishes near to confluence (5–8 × 105 cells per dish). For pulse-chase experiments at the restrictive temperature, the cells were preincubated at 41 °C for 2 h. For treatments with proteasome inhibitors, the cells were pretreated at 30 or at 41 °C with ALLN (80 μm), ZLLNva (40 μm), or ZLLL (50 μm) for 90 min in complete medium and for another 30-min period in serum- and methionine-free RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were labeled in serum- and methionine-free medium containing [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml) for 10 min at the indicated temperatures. Subsequent chase incubations were carried out in complete medium supplemented with methionine (5 mm). Cells were lysed with 300 μl of an SDS-containing buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, and a mixture of the following protease inhibitors: 1.7 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/mll-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucine, 5 mm PMSF), and after sonication and boiling of the cell lysate, 1 ml of wash buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1.25% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors as above) was added. Immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-ribophorin I antiserum (4 μl/ml lysate) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 8% gels, unless noted otherwise, and fluorography, as reported previously (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When necessary, immunoprecipitates were treated with endo H, as described (43Rosenfeld M.G. Marcantonio E.E. Hakimi J. Ort V.M. Atkinson P.H. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Quantitations of immunoprecipitations were performed by scanning densitometry using the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). ts20-RI332 cells were grown on coverslips for 36 h at 30 °C. After pretreatment of the cells at the appropriate temperature conditions, followed by an incubation in the absence or presence of BFA (5 μg/ml) for 30 min, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 3.5 min and then subjected to immunofluorescence staining, as described previously (44Ivessa N.E.

The monoclonal CTR433 mouse antibody was used as a marker for the medial Golgi cisternae (39Jasmin B.J. Cartaud J. Bornens M. Changeux J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7218-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and applied at a dilution of 1:2 in blocking medium (1% non-fat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline). The secondary affinity purified, Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2 antibody fragments were used at a dilution of 1:40 in the same medium. After mounting, the staining was visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 photomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with epifluorescence optics and photographed using Kodak TMAX-400 ASA film. E36-RI332 cells were grown in a 6-cm dish near to confluence (1.5–2 × 106cells). The cells were pretreated and further incubated during the experiment with ZLLL, and then pulse labeling was done for 30 min, followed by a chase incubation of 10 min under the conditions described above. A cell lysate was prepared with 600 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, protease inhibitors) in the presence of NEM (5 mm), which was also included during all subsequent manipulations to inhibit potent isopeptidase activities that may affect the detection of multi-ubiquitinated proteins (45Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). After sonication and boiling of the lysate, 2 ml of wash buffer (25 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 1.25% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors) were added. Two 20% aliquots of the total lysate were used for anti-ribophorin I immunoprecipitations under the conditions described above, except that the SDS concentration was maintained at 0.2%. Two aliquots, 10 and 50% of the total lysate, were used for anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitations (10 μl antiserum/ml lysate). Immunocomplexes were recovered as described previously (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates from one of the 20% aliquots of the anti-ribophorin I samples and the 10% aliquot of the anti-ubiquitin samples were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. For the others, the material was eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling for 5 min in a buffer containing 0.2% SDS, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors, and 5 mm NEM. These eluates were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitations in the presence of 0.2% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and 5 mm NEM using anti-ubiquitin and anti-ribophorin I antisera, respectively, before analysis as described (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E36-RI332 and ts20-RI332 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. The cells, treated at 30 and 41 °C, respectively, in the absence or presence of ZLLL, were subjected to metabolic labeling for 2 h followed by chase incubations. The preparation of the cell lysates (2.6 ml total volume) and the immunoprecipitations with the anti-calnexin (10 μl/350 μl of lysate) and anti-ribophorin I antibodies were performed in the presence of 1% CHAPS, as described previously (41Ou W.-J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were either analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE as described (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by boiling for 5 min in a buffer containing 2% SDS, 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. The eluates were subjected to a second round of immunoprecipitations using anti-ribophorin I and anti-calnexin antibodies, respectively, before analysis as described (34Tsao Y.-S. Ivessa N.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. Kreibich G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ts20-RI332 cells, grown in 6-cm dishes, were left untreated or treated with ZLLL at 30 °C or incubated at 41 °C. The cells were labeled for 30 min, incubated in chase medium, and lysed (2.6 ml total volume). The co-immunoprecipitations with anti-Sec61β (2.5 μl/850 μl of lysate) and anti-ribophorin I antibodies were carried out as described above for the anti-calnexin immunoprecipitations, except that no NaCl was included in the lysis and wash buffers and that the immunoprecipitates were analyzed on Tricine gels as described (46Gallagher S.R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 10.2.1-10.2.35Google Scholar). E36-RI332 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes near to confluence (approximately 5 × 106 cells per dish). The cells were left untreated or pretreated with ZLLL at 30 °C for 90 min in complete medium and for another 30-min period in serum- and methionine-free medium in the absence or presence of the inhibitor. Similarly, ts20-RI332 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and incubated at 30 or 41 °C. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (250 μCi/ml) for 30 min and then incubated in chase medium for 10 min or 1 h in the continued absence or presence of the proteasome inhibitor and at the appropriate temperature. Cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer in the presence of an isotonic buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). The lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells and cell debris. The protein concentrations of the 1000 ×g supernatants were determined (47Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and equal amounts of protein in each supernatant were subjected to a 100,000 ×g ultracentrifugation. The 100,000 × gsupernatants were adjusted to a final concentration of 25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 0.6% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors as above and used for anti-ribophorin I and anti-PDI (6 μl/sample) immunoprecipitations, respectively. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). Two equal aliquots of the resuspend"

Here we report a novel feature induced by TNF, namely translocation of mitochondria from a dispersed distribution to a perinuclear cluster. Mitochondrial translocation correlated with sensitivity to the cell death-inducing activity of TNF and was mediated by the 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R55), but not by Fas, indicating that the signaling pathway requires a TNF-R55-specific but death domain-independent signal. Indeed, using L929 cells that express mutant TNF-R55, we showed that the membrane-proximal region of TNF-R55 was essential for signaling to mitochondrial translocation. In the absence of translocation, the cell death response was markedly delayed, pointing to a cooperative effect on cell death. Translocation of mitochondria, although dependent on the microtubules, was not imposed by the latter and was equally induced by TNF-independent immunoinhibition of the motor protein kinesin. Additionally, immunoinhibition with antibody directed against the tail domain of kinesin synergized with TNF-induced cell death. Based on this functional mimicry, we propose that a TNF-R55 membrane-proximal region-dependent signal impedes mitochondria-associated kinesin, resulting in cooperation with the TNF-R55 death domain-induced cytotoxic response and causing the observed clustering of mitochondria.

Mitochondria are the energy-providing organelles in eukaryotic cells. However, accumulating evidence shows that these organelles also have an active function in cell death.

A causative link between ΔΨm and nuclear apoptosis is supported by the release of a caspase-like, apoptosis-inducing factor from the mitochondrial intermembrane space after permeability transition, a condition leading to ΔΨm disruption (3Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). In addition to apoptosis-inducing factor, cytochrome c induces apoptosis in a cell-free system in the presence of dATP and cytosolic extracts (4Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4448) Google Scholar). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria is independent of permeability transition and ΔΨm disruption, suggesting a possible role in apoptosis in cell types that do not exhibit disruption of ΔΨm (5Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4267) Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Liu X. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J. Peng T.-I. Jones D.P. Wang X. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Moreover, Bcl-2 prevents release of apoptosis-inducing factor and cytochromec from the mitochondria (3Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Marchetti P. Macho A. Daugas E. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 5Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), and Bcl-xLinhibits the accumulation of cytochrome c in the cytosol during apoptosis possibly by binding to it and thus blocking its availability (7Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Schofield L. Israels S. Roncinske R. Yoshida K. Bharti A. Yuan Z.-M. Saxena S. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, the antiapoptotic role of Bcl-2 and family members could be based on counteracting mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent release of apoptogenic factors. Mitochondrial dysfunction also plays a crucial role in cell types that exhibit necrosis-like cell death after activation of their death program. Disruption of plasma membrane integrity by the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) represents an irreversible commitment to cell death in the murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929 (8Grooten J.

Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and depends on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the mitochondria (9Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C.

A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Also, in drug-resistant leukemia cells, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by TNF is, at least partially, responsible for cytotoxicity (12Jia L. Kelsey S.M. Grahn M.F. Jiang X.R. Newland A.C. Blood. 1996; 87: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while in human ovarian carcinoma cell lines there is evidence for an involvement of mitochondrial ROS in TNF-mediated cell death (13Uslu R. Bonavida B. Cancer. 1996; 77: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The 55-kDa TNF receptor (TNF-R55) and Fas (APO-1 or CD95), both members of the TNF receptor family, can trigger the cell death program of several cell types. Additionally, TNF-R55 mediates gene induction by activation of the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the transcription factors AP-1 and ATF-2 (14Beyaert R. Fiers W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) and triggers phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cascades by activation of p38/RK mitogen-activated protein kinase (15Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The clustered intracellular domains of TNF-R55 bind, directly or indirectly, a variety of signaling molecules responsible for the multiple signals emanating from the activated receptor. Evidence for the role of TNF-R55-associated (but also of Fas-associated) proteins in the cytocidal function of both receptors emerged from the identification of the so-called “death domain” (DD) located in the C-terminal region of the intracellular part of the receptors (16Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar, 17Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1627-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The DD mediates protein-protein interactions of the receptor with other DD-containing proteins that act as initiating centers for different signaling cascades (18Varfolomeev E.E. Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thus, Fas-associated, recruited directly by Fas (19Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M.

Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar), links the receptors to caspase-8 and the cell death program (22Enari M. Talanian R.V. Wong W.W. Nagata S. Nature. 1996; 380: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 23Greidinger E.L. Miller D.K. Yamin T.T. Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Also, receptor-interacting protein binds to TNF receptor-associated DD and may be involved in binding and/or function of TRAF2 (18Varfolomeev E.E. Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Wallach D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1271-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 24Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). Although it seems that the DD of TNF-R55 elicits most of the known TNF-induced phenomena, there is accumulating evidence for a role of the membrane-proximal region of the intracellular part of the receptor. Induction of nitric-oxide synthase requires this region in addition to the DD (16Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Activation of c-Raf-1 kinase and phospholipase A2 occurs through the membrane-proximal half of TNF-R55 (25Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 26Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R. Neuloh M. Herrmann F. Krönke M. Brach M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1156-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the activation of membrane-associated neutral sphingomyelinase is linked to this region by the protein FAN (27Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegmann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Krönke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), while also phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase can interact with TNF-R55 through its juxtamembrane region (28Castellino A.M. Parker G.J. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5861-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a novel activity of TNF, namely the induction of an altered spatial distribution of mitochondria in TNF-sensitive cells. This translocation of mitochondria depends on a signal from the membrane-proximal region of TNF-R55 and thus represents a novel function of this region. The driving force of this translocation was not the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, but rather a loss of outward directed movement of mitochondria caused by an impaired activity of the molecular motor kinesin. Functional studies as well as the kinetics of mitochondrial translocation and its correlation with the death-inducing activity of TNF, but not with gene induction, implicate this response and its apparent molecular counterpart, namely inactivation of mitochondria-associated kinesin, in the cell death response.

All cell lines were mycoplasma-free as judged from an enzyme immunoassay (Boehringer Mannheim). Murine TNF (mTNF) was produced inEscherichia coli and purified to at least 99% homogeneity in our laboratory. It had a specific activity of 1.9 × 108 IU/mg of protein (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK), contained 4 ng of endotoxin/mg of protein, and was used at 1000 IU/ml. Propidium iodide (PI), cycloheximide (CHX), H2O2, menadione,tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and nocodazole (all from Sigma) were used at final concentrations of 30 μm, 50 μg/ml, 2.5 mm, 1 mm, 2.5 mm, and 10 μm, respectively. Rhodamine 123 (R123), MitoTracker CMTMRos, and paclitaxel (all from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used at final concentrations of 1 μm. Staurosporine (Boehringer Mannheim) was used at 10 μm. SUK4 antibody (Ab) and SUK5 Ab were purified by means of a Protein G column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) from ascites fluid and culture supernatant, respectively. Ab labeling with Cy5 fluorochrome was performed using an Ab labeling kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded in chambered coverslips (2 cm2, 105 cells/well) and preincubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Mitochondria were stained with R123 or MitoTracker CMTMRos for 30 min at 37 °C before analysis. L929 cells and L929-derived cells were washed three times with Hepes-buffered MEM, supplemented with the same additives as Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MEM-Hepes), to remove excess R123 or MitoTracker CMTMRos and kept in MEM-Hepes. MEM-Hepes was preferred over Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium because of the CO2independence and the fluorescent background problems generated by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium during the measurements. The distribution of mitochondria was analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope. R123 and MitoTracker CMTMRos were excited and detected as shown in Table I. The time point at which TNF was added is referred to as 0 h. At regular times after TNF administration, fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images from four randomly chosen microscopic fields, each containing approximately 50 cells, were recorded. Translocation was represented as the percentage of viable cells exhibiting the clustered mitochondrial distribution.Table ISpectral properties of fluorochromes usedFluorochromeExcitation wavelengthEmission filtersnmnmFITC488BP 515–525PI488LP 610R123488BP 515–525CMTMRos543BP 570Cy5633LP 665 Open table in a new tab Apoptosis induced by TNF and anti-human Fas mAb (500 ng/ml; ImmunoTech, Alston, MA) in U937 cells was quantified in a flow cytometric assay based on DNA degradation using PI. After intercalation in DNA, PI generates a fluorescent emission light, the intensity of which correlates with the amount of DNA. In viable, permeabilized cells, this results in fluorescence intensity peaks corresponding to the G1 (2n), S and G2/M (4n) phases of the cell cycle. Cells dying by apoptosis contain degraded DNA, resulting in hypoploidy and hence reduced PI fluorescence. U937 cells were permeabilized by freezing/thawing in the presence of PI. The number of hypoploid cells was determined with an Epics 753 flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL), using the same excitation and emission wavelengths as in CLSM (Table I), as a measure for TNF-induced apoptosis. Cell death of L929 and L929-derived cell lines was measured by quantification of PI-positive cells by CLSM and was induced by incubation with either TNF in L929, TNF and CHX in L929r2, htr-1 mAb (100 ng/ml; a gift of Dr. M. Brockhaus, F. Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland), or anti-mTNF-R55 (500 ng/ml; Genzyme Corporation, Boston, MA) in L929hR55wt and L929hR55ΔMPR, and anti-human Fas mAb (500 ng/ml) in L929hFas cells. Cell death is presented as the percentage of PI-positive cells in the whole cell population. Dihydrorhodamine 123 was added to suspension cultures at the same time as TNF. Cell samples were taken at regular time intervals and analyzed on an Epics 753 flow cytometer. R123 fluorescence resulting from dihydrorhodamine 123 oxidation was excited and detected (Table I). 3000 viable cells were measured per sample. Cell debris and multicell aggregates were gated out electronically. The variation observed in ROS measurements was <10%. The presence of IL-6 bioactivity in the culture supernatant of 3 × 105cells/ml was determined after 5 h of TNF stimulation, using the proliferative response of the IL-6-responsive murine plasmacytoma cell line 7TD1 (31Van Snick J. Cayphas S. Vink A. Uyttenhove C. Coulie P.G. Rubira M.R. Simpson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9679-9683Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). L929 cells were grown on glass coverslips. Where necessary, MitoTracker CMTMRos was added to the culture medium for 30 min to stain mitochondria before fixation. Coverslips, fixed at −20 °C with methanol, were stained for MTs by incubation with 10-fold diluted rat anti-tubulin hybridoma YOL1/34 supernatant (Harlan Sera-Lab, Crawley Down, UK) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and a 30-min incubation with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG Ab (1:100; Harlan Sera-Lab). Staining of the kinesin heavy chain (KHC) was performed by incubation of coverslips with 10 μg/ml Cy5-labeled SUK4 mAb. Coverslips were mounted in VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope, typically with a scanning time of 1 s and 8× line averaging. The excitation wavelengths and emission filters used for the different fluorochromes are shown in Table I. Syringe loading of L929 cells with mAb was performed as described previously (32Clarke M.S.F. McNeil P.L. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 533-541PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, L929 cells were harvested from adherent, subconfluent cultures by treatment with enzyme-free cell dissociation solution (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). 5 × 105 cells were transferred to a 1.5-ml reaction tube in a volume of 0.1 ml of medium. mAb was added to a final concentration of 0.48 mg/ml, with an unlabeled/fluorescent labeled ratio of 15:1, followed by the addition of Pluronic F-68 (Sigma; 2% (v/v)). This solution was transferred 20 times through a 30-G injection needle. Excess Ab and pluronic F-68 were washed away, and the cells were seeded in chambered coverslips for CLSM analysis. The cells were allowed to recover for 12 h before the experiment. There was typically 10% cell death resulting from loading; dead cells were removed by washing after the recovery period. Loaded cells were identified by the presence of fluorescence in the cytosol and represented typically 50–60% of the total cell population. L929hR55wt and L929hR55ΔMPR cells were harvested from adherent, subconfluent cultures by treatment with enzyme-free cell dissociation solution. 106 cells were incubated for 1 h with the primary Ab,viz. htr-9 (200 ng; a gift of Dr. M. Brockhaus), in the case of hTNF-R55 or anti-mTNF-R55 mAb (200 ng). FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig or goat anti-hamster Ig (both from Harlan Sera-Lab) were used as secondary Ab. FITC fluorescence intensity was analyzed on an Epics 753 flow cytometer. Activation of NF-κB was measured in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Subconfluent monolayers of L929r2 cells were treated with TNF for 1 h. Nuclear protein and binding reactions were performed as described previously (33Patestos N.P. Haegeman G. Vandevoorde V. Fiers W. Biochimie. 1993; 75: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). L929 cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS and various protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 10 μm Pefabloc (Pentapharm, Basel, Switzerland), 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmNaF, aprotinin (100 times diluted), 1 mmNaVO3). 100 μg of protein was separated on a 7.5% SDS gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, and processed for ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary Ab, SUK4 mAb, or irrelevant mAb (mouse anti-hamster IgG mAb; PharMingen, San Diego, CA) was used at 500 ng/ml. TNF treatment of the murine fibrosarcoma cell line L929 results in cell death by an atypical, necrosis-like process, which is characterized by cell swelling, disruption of plasma membrane integrity, and subsequently cellular collapse (8Grooten J. Goossens V. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial dysfunction is crucial in this TNF-induced cytotoxic process; ROS are formed in the mitochondria, and interference with the generation or scavenging of these ROS arrests cell death (9Schulze-Osthoff K.

A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Using CLSM, we observed that within 1 h of treatment of L929 cells with TNF the spatial distribution of mitochondria evolved in the majority of the cells from an originally scattered, bipolar or nearly symmetric distribution to an asymmetric, clustered distribution (Fig. 1). Analysis of the kinetics of this mitochondrial translocation revealed that the response preceded mitochondrial ROS production and subsequent cell death by several hours (Fig. 2 A). For these experiments, the mitochondria-specific dye R123 was preferred because preliminary experiments had shown that this dye did not interfere with cell viability or responsiveness to TNF. However, since the specificity of R123 derives from its ΔΨm-dependent accumulation in the mitochondria, a disruption of ΔΨmin a fraction of the mitochondria could be perceived as a translocation. Yet, revealing the spatial distribution of mitochondria with MitoTracker, a mitochondria-specific dye that is retained in the mitochondria by the thiol reactivity of its chloromethyl moiety (34Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), yielded an altered distribution identical to the one observed after treatment with TNF (data not shown). Consequently, the modified distribution of R123 and MitoTracker fluorescence in TNF-treated L929 cells reflects the modified spatial distribution of mitochondria and not a loss of ΔΨm in a fraction of the organelles.Figure 2TNF-induced translocation of mitochondria precedes cell death. A, the increment of cells exhibiting translocated mitochondria (line), of dead cells (bar) and of ROS production (inset) was measured following the addition of TNF. Translocation was analyzed by CLSM in approximately 150–200 cells using the mitochondria-specific probe R123. Cell death was quantified simultaneously by PI uptake. The production of mitochondrial ROS was measured in a parallel flow-cytometric assay as described previously (11Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) using the ROS-sensitive probe dihydrorhodamine 123 and is expressed as the increment in fluorescence relative to untreated cells. The data shown are representative of five experiments (n = 5). B, U937 cells. Similarly to L929 cells, TNF-induced translocation of mitochondria (line) was analyzed by CLSM (n = 5). The percentage of dead cells (bar) was obtained by flow cytometry based on the number of cells exhibiting hypoploidy (n = 5). C, cell death was induced in L929 cells by treatment with either TNF or the cytotoxic agent menadione (Men), tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), H2O2, or staurosporine (STS). After 4 h of treatment, the occurrence of mitochondrial translocation (lower half) and cell death (upper half) was analyzed as described above (n = 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to L929, cell death induced by TNF in the human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 is accompanied by plasma membrane blebbing, DNA degradation, and subsequent formation of apoptotic bodies (data not shown), features characteristic of apoptosis. To verify whether also in these cells mitochondria converge in response to treatment with TNF, TNF-treated U937 cells were stained with R123 and analyzed by CLSM. As shown in Fig. 2 B, cells exhibiting a clustered spatial distribution of mitochondria became apparent within 1 h of TNF treatment, preceding the onset of the apoptotic response by several hours. Clearly, translocation of mitochondria occurs independently of the mechanism of cell death, viz. necrosis-like or apoptotic, and is an early feature relative to the implementation of the cell death program. Cell death is accompanied by morphological changes that occur independently of the type of signal triggering the process. Since the observed translocation of mitochondria could be such a phenomenon, we induced cell death in L929 cells by administration of the cytotoxic agent menadione, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, H2O2, or staurosporine, after which the distribution of mitochondria was analyzed (Fig. 2 C). Despite clear cytotoxicity, no changes in the spatial distribution of mitochondria were observed. This negative result clearly demonstrates that induction of mitochondrial translocation is an intrinsic feature of the TNF signal transduction pathway. To establish the relationship between the observed clustering of mitochondria and the cytocidal versusnoncytocidal activities of TNF, we studied the occurrence of mitochondrial translocation, cell death, activation of NF-κB, and gene induction in the L929 variant L929r2 (29Vanhaesebroeck B. Van Bladel S. Lenaerts A. Suffys P. Beyaert R. Lucas R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 2469-2477PubMed Google Scholar). L929r2 cells are resistant to the cytocidal activity of TNF but retain responsiveness to its noncytocidal activities exemplified by activation of NF-κB and subsequent expression of IL-6. However, the addition of the RNA or protein synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D or CHX, respectively, fully restores the cytocidal response to TNF. As shown in Fig. 3 A, mitochondria converged after TNF tre"
https://openalex.org/W2112029698,"Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) has been shown to be a multifunctional enzyme catalyzing the formation of disulfide bonds, as well as being a component of the enzymes prolyl 4-hydroxylase (P4-H) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. It has also been proposed to function as a molecular chaperone during the refolding of denatured proteins in vitro. To investigate the role of this multifunctional protein within a cellular context, we have established a semi-permeabilized cell system that reconstitutes the synthesis, folding, modification, and assembly of procollagen as they would occur in the cell. We demonstrate here that P4-H associates transiently with the triple helical domain during the assembly of procollagen. The release of P4-H from the triple helical domain coincides with assembly into a thermally stable triple helix. However, if triple helix formation is prevented, P4-H remains associated, suggesting a role for this enzyme in preventing aggregation of this domain. We also show that PDI associates independently with the C-propeptide of monomeric procollagen chains prior to trimer formation, indicating a role for this protein in coordinating the assembly of heterotrimeric molecules. This demonstrates that PDI has multiple functions in the folding of the same protein, that is, as a catalyst for disulfide bond formation, as a subunit of P4-H during proline hydroxylation, and independently as a molecular chaperone during chain assembly.

Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, PDI has been proposed to act as a molecular chaperone by binding to unfolded proteins, thereby preventing aggregation (5Cai H. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quan H. Fan G. Wang C. J. Biol.

This proposal is based on the observation that PDI assists in the refolding of certain denatured proteins in vitro, but this activity appears to be substrate specific, with no activity or even negative (antichaperone) activity being observed with some protein substrates (9Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

PDI also has been shown to interact with newly synthesized proteins (12Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Zimmerman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and with cysteine mutants of human lysozyme (14Otsu M. Omura F. Yoshimori T. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6874-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether this interaction reflects chaperone activity or the binding of PDI to its substrate during disulfide bond formation still needs to be determined.PDI is clearly a key cellular folding enzyme that is important for the maturation of several secreted and membrane associated proteins. This is particularly true for the folding and maturation of procollagen, where PDI is involved in a number of key stages. As the polypeptide chain is translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, intrachain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide and C-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). Chains then associate via the C-propeptides to form homo- or heterotrimeric molecules. This allows the triple helical domain to form a nucleation point at its C-terminal end, ensuring correct alignment of the chains. The triple helix then folds in a C- to N-direction, with the N-propeptides finally associating and in some cases forming interchain disulfide bonds (16Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PDI participates during proline hydroxylation as a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and also catalyzes the formation of both intra- (17Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and interchain disulfide bonds (18Koivu J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6159-6164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Most of our understanding of how procollagen folds and assembles within the cell has come from studies of cells grown in culture, particularly either skin or tendon fibroblasts. Although this approach has provided us with a clear outline of the intracellular folding and assembly of procollagen, it does not lend itself to a more detailed analysis of the molecular recognition events occurring during assembly. To facilitate these studies, a semi-permeabilized cell system has been developed that reconstitutes the initial stages in the assembly and modification of procollagen as they would occur in an intact cell (19Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Using this system, the translocation, disulfide bond formation, and assembly of procollagen into a correctly aligned triple helical molecule has been reconstituted, in a system that mimics the processes as they would occur within an intact cell (20Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these studies to investigate the role of PDI in the folding and assembly of procollagen. We have demonstrated that this protein not only participates in disulfide bond formation and proline hydroxylation but also acts as a molecular chaperone interacting specifically and independently with procollagen chains that remain monomeric, thereby preventing premature assembly or aggregation.DISCUSSIONThe biosynthesis of multisubunit proteins entering the secretory pathway is regulated at the ER, where the individual subunits are synthesized and their assembly is coordinated. This regulation ensures that unassembled subunits are prevented from being transported out of the ER and are either degraded or maintained in an assembly competent state by interacting with ER resident proteins (31Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this “quality control” appears to involve the binding of unassembled subunits to a variety of ER proteins until assembly occurs. The assembled complex is then released and can be transported from the ER. Such a mechanism has been likened to affinity chromatography, with the “matrix” being the resident proteins in the ER and the selective interactions occurring via oligosaccharide side chains (32Ware F.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), hydrophobic regions in the protein (33Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of free thiol residues (34Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or with specific molecular chaperones (35Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This study has demonstrated that protein-disulfide isomerase also plays a role in this regulation by binding to procollagen chains either as a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase or independently.The procollagen trimer is folded and assembled through a series of distinct intermediates; the coordination of this assembly is crucial to produce a correctly folded, thermally stable triple helical molecule. One consequence of the sequence of events occurring during procollagen folding is that the individual chains have to be maintained in a soluble form prior to assembly occurring. The triple helical domain is inherently insoluble and must be prevented from self-association for several minutes, (37Bruckner P. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) because the chains associate at their C-propeptides and the triple helical domain folds in the C to N direction (16Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We show here that P4-H plays a key role in ensuring that the triple helical domain remains soluble by binding to unhydroxylated chains. The binding of P4-H to its substrate in the absence of the co-factors iron and ascorbate has been shown previously using purified proteins (38Juva K. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6486-6492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that this interaction also occurs during biosynthesis within the ER provides convincing evidence that enzymes involved in posttranslational modification can under certain circumstances also play a crucial role in maintaining polypeptides in an assembly competent state. That P4-H can also bind to hydroxylated chains provides a clue to how procollagen chains hydroxylated at the N-terminal end of the triple helical domain are prevented from associating prior to folding and association of the C-propeptides. Interestingly, mutant procollagen chains, which contain a deletion in their triple helical domain and which form trimers with wild type chains, have also been shown to form a stable interaction with P4H (30Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a stable interaction has been suggested to prevent secretion of these molecules by retention in the ER.Monomeric procollagen chains that are destined to be incorporated into heterotrimers also need to remain soluble and be prevented from nonpermissive associations prior to assembly. When we expressed the type I proα-chains individually, we observed an interaction of the C-propeptides of these chains with PDI. The proα1 chain of type I procollagen has previously been shown to be able to form homotrimers at a low efficiency (39Uitto J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This was also the case here, with the majority of the synthesized chains remaining monomeric. The proα1 chain of type III efficiently form homotrimers and, significantly, did not interact with PDI at its C-propeptide. However, when this chain was altered to prevent association by changing its recognition site to that of the proα2-chain of type I, an interaction with PDI could be detected. We and others have previously shown that point mutations within the C-propeptide can cause misfolding of this domain (21Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24354-24360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to binding to ER proteins, such as immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) (40Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cases, the proα-chains were unable to form correct intrachain disulfide bonds and migrated as a diffuse smear when separated under nonreducing conditions. The proα-chain we have constructed here with an altered recognition site was able to form intrachain disulfide bonds. The polypeptide synthesized migrated as a sharp band when separated under nonreducing conditions, which co-migrated with the wild type protein. This indicates that the C-propeptide folded correctly but was unable to assemble due to its altered recognition site. These results clearly demonstrate that PDI plays a crucial role in binding to the C-propeptide, thereby coordinating heterotrimer assembly.A growing body of evidence is accumulating that suggests a key role for the collagen binding protein HSP47 in the biosynthesis of procollagen (36Nagata K.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that procollagen within the ER is associated with HSP47 (41Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and can dissociate upon transport to the Golgi apparatus (42Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It has been reported that HSP47 binds to the N-propeptide of type I procollagen (43Hu G. Gura T. Sabay B. Sauk J. Dixit S.N. Veis A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1995; 59: 350-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), yet other workers have also reported binding to the triple helical domain (42Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Yokota S.-I. Hosokawa N Nagata K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). During our studies, we were unable to immunoprecipitate our procollagen constructs with anti-HSP47 antibodies after cross-linking. It could be that our shortened triple helical domains do not contain the binding site for this molecule or could simply reflect inefficient cross-linking. The folding and assembly of procollagen is a complex process and may require a number of different chaperone proteins to ensure efficient folding, assembly, and intracellular transport. There is also likely to be redundancy in the involvement of accessory proteins, as has been illustrated by the successful expression and assembly of procollagen in insect cells (44Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which are unlikely to contain HSP47. Clearly, PDI, P4H, and HSP47 may have overlapping functions as molecular chaperones during procollagen biosynthesis. The interactions described here provide the first direct evidence for a chaperone role for PDI (and P4-H) during assembly of procollagen chains by preventing their premature and hence nonproductive interaction. The interaction of procollagen intermediates with PDI may also, by virtue of its KDEL-retention sequence, provide a mechanism for retention of non-triple helical procollagen chains. Protein-disulfide isomerase is now firmly established as a multifunctional protein that both catalyzes the formation of disulfide bonds and acts as a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (1Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar).

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9728-9735Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In this respect, its function is independent of disulfide isomerase activity (4Vuori K. Pihlajaniemi T. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4213-4218Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, PDI has been proposed to act as a molecular chaperone by binding to unfolded proteins, thereby preventing aggregation (5Cai H. Wang C.-C. Tsou C.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24550-24552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Quan H. Fan G. Wang C. J. Biol.

This proposal is based on the observation that PDI assists in the refolding of certain denatured proteins in vitro, but this activity appears to be substrate specific, with no activity or even negative (antichaperone) activity being observed with some protein substrates (9Lilie H. McLaughlin S. Freedman R. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14290-14296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Puig A. Gilbert H.F. J. Biol.

PDI also has been shown to interact with newly synthesized proteins (12Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Zimmerman R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and with cysteine mutants of human lysozyme (14Otsu M. Omura F. Yoshimori T. Kikuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6874-6877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but whether this interaction reflects chaperone activity or the binding of PDI to its substrate during disulfide bond formation still needs to be determined. PDI is clearly a key cellular folding enzyme that is important for the maturation of several secreted and membrane associated proteins. This is particularly true for the folding and maturation of procollagen, where PDI is involved in a number of key stages. As the polypeptide chain is translocated across the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, intrachain disulfide bonds are formed within the N-propeptide and C-propeptide, and hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues occurs within the triple helical domain (15Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modification of Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). Chains then associate via the C-propeptides to form homo- or heterotrimeric molecules. This allows the triple helical domain to form a nucleation point at its C-terminal end, ensuring correct alignment of the chains. The triple helix then folds in a C- to N-direction, with the N-propeptides finally associating and in some cases forming interchain disulfide bonds (16Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). PDI participates during proline hydroxylation as a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase and also catalyzes the formation of both intra- (17Bulleid N.J. Freedman R.B. Nature. 1988; 335: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and interchain disulfide bonds (18Koivu J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6159-6164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of our understanding of how procollagen folds and assembles within the cell has come from studies of cells grown in culture, particularly either skin or tendon fibroblasts. Although this approach has provided us with a clear outline of the intracellular folding and assembly of procollagen, it does not lend itself to a more detailed analysis of the molecular recognition events occurring during assembly. To facilitate these studies, a semi-permeabilized cell system has been developed that reconstitutes the initial stages in the assembly and modification of procollagen as they would occur in an intact cell (19Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Using this system, the translocation, disulfide bond formation, and assembly of procollagen into a correctly aligned triple helical molecule has been reconstituted, in a system that mimics the processes as they would occur within an intact cell (20Bulleid N.J. Wilson R. Lees J.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, we have extended these studies to investigate the role of PDI in the folding and assembly of procollagen. We have demonstrated that this protein not only participates in disulfide bond formation and proline hydroxylation but also acts as a molecular chaperone interacting specifically and independently with procollagen chains that remain monomeric, thereby preventing premature assembly or aggregation. DISCUSSIONThe biosynthesis of multisubunit proteins entering the secretory pathway is regulated at the ER, where the individual subunits are synthesized and their assembly is coordinated. This regulation ensures that unassembled subunits are prevented from being transported out of the ER and are either degraded or maintained in an assembly competent state by interacting with ER resident proteins (31Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying this “quality control” appears to involve the binding of unassembled subunits to a variety of ER proteins until assembly occurs. The assembled complex is then released and can be transported from the ER. Such a mechanism has been likened to affinity chromatography, with the “matrix” being the resident proteins in the ER and the selective interactions occurring via oligosaccharide side chains (32Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), hydrophobic regions in the protein (33Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), of free thiol residues (34Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or with specific molecular chaperones (35Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 36Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This study has demonstrated that protein-disulfide isomerase also plays a role in this regulation by binding to procollagen chains either as a subunit of prolyl 4-hydroxylase or independently.The procollagen trimer is folded and assembled through a series of distinct intermediates; the coordination of this assembly is crucial to produce a correctly folded, thermally stable triple helical molecule. One consequence of the sequence of events occurring during procollagen folding is that the individual chains have to be maintained in a soluble form prior to assembly occurring. The triple helical domain is inherently insoluble and must be prevented from self-association for several minutes, (37Bruckner P. Eikenberry E.F. Prockop D.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 118: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) because the chains associate at their C-propeptides and the triple helical domain folds in the C to N direction (16Engel J. Prockop D.J. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 137-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We show here that P4-H plays a key role in ensuring that the triple helical domain remains soluble by binding to unhydroxylated chains. The binding of P4-H to its substrate in the absence of the co-factors iron and ascorbate has been shown previously using purified proteins (38Juva K. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6486-6492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that this interaction also occurs during biosynthesis within the ER provides convincing evidence that enzymes involved in posttranslational modification can under certain circumstances also play a crucial role in maintaining polypeptides in an assembly competent state. That P4-H can also bind to hydroxylated chains provides a clue to how procollagen chains hydroxylated at the N-terminal end of the triple helical domain are prevented from associating prior to folding and association of the C-propeptides. Interestingly, mutant procollagen chains, which contain a deletion in their triple helical domain and which form trimers with wild type chains, have also been shown to form a stable interaction with P4H (30Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7751-7757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a stable interaction has been suggested to prevent secretion of these molecules by retention in the ER.Monomeric procollagen chains that are destined to be incorporated into heterotrimers also need to remain soluble and be prevented from nonpermissive associations prior to assembly. When we expressed the type I proα-chains individually, we observed an interaction of the C-propeptides of these chains with PDI. The proα1 chain of type I procollagen has previously been shown to be able to form homotrimers at a low efficiency (39Uitto J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This was also the case here, with the majority of the synthesized chains remaining monomeric. The proα1 chain of type III efficiently form homotrimers and, significantly, did not interact with PDI at its C-propeptide. However, when this chain was altered to prevent association by changing its recognition site to that of the proα2-chain of type I, an interaction with PDI could be detected. We and others have previously shown that point mutations within the C-propeptide can cause misfolding of this domain (21Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24354-24360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which leads to binding to ER proteins, such as immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP) (40Chessler S.D. Byers P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18226-18233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in these cases, the proα-chains were unable to form correct intrachain disulfide bonds and migrated as a diffuse smear when separated under nonreducing conditions. The proα-chain we have constructed here with an altered recognition site was able to form intrachain disulfide bonds. The polypeptide synthesized migrated as a sharp band when separated under nonreducing conditions, which co-migrated with the wild type protein. This indicates that the C-propeptide folded correctly but was unable to assemble due to its altered recognition site. These results clearly demonstrate that PDI plays a crucial role in binding to the C-propeptide, thereby coordinating heterotrimer assembly.A growing body of evidence is accumulating that suggests a key role for the collagen binding protein HSP47 in the biosynthesis of procollagen (36Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 23-26Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that procollagen within the ER is associated with HSP47 (41Nakai A. Satoh M. Hirayoshi K. Nagata K. J.

In vivo, the capping reactions occur cotranscriptionally, i.e. the substrates for the capping enzymes are nascent RNA chains engaged within RNA polymerase II (pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid.elongation complexes. There must exist a mechanism to target cap formation in vivo to transcripts made by pol II, because the capping enzymes have no inherent specificity for modifying pre-mRNAs in vitro. We and others (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L.

A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) have suggested that targeting is achieved through direct physical interaction of one or more components of the capping apparatus with the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of pol II. This model is supported by the finding that recombinant yeast guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase proteins bind specifically and independently to the phosphorylated CTD in vitro (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Are such direct protein-protein interactions conserved in higher eukaryotes? Does the triphosphatase component of the capping apparatus also interact with the CTD? We know that the physical and functional organizations of the triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase components of the capping apparatus have diverged in fungi versus metazoans. The guanylyltransferases of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ceg1; 459 amino acids), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Pce1; 402 amino acids), and Candida albicans (Cgt1; 449 amino acids) are monofunctional polypeptides that cap diphosphate-terminated RNAs (5Shibagaki Y.

Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transfer of GMP from GTP to the 5′ diphosphate terminus of RNA occurs in a two-stage reaction involving a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate (8Shuman S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The GMP is linked to the enzyme through a phosphoamide (P–N) bond to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue within a conserved motif, KXDG, found in all known cellular and DNA virus-encoded capping enzymes (9Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The fungal guanylyltransferases display ∼38% amino acid sequence identity overall. They are also functionally homologous, insofar asPCE1 and CGT1 can complement lethalceg1 mutations in S. cerevisiae (6Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 7Yamada-Okabe T. Shimmi O. Doi R. Mizumoto K. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). TheS. cerevisiae RNA triphosphatase is a 549-amino acid polypeptide encoded by the CET1 gene (10Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The Ceg1 and Cet1 polypeptides interact in vivo and in vitro. Metazoan capping enzymes are bifunctional polypeptides with triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase activities (11Yagi Y. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 12Yagi Y. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4695-4698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yagiet al. (12Yagi Y. Mizumoto K. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4695-4698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domain fragments of the Artemia salina capping enzyme by partial proteolysis with trypsin. However, it was not clear from this work whether the functional domains overlapped structurally. The first metazoan-capping enzyme gene was isolated recently fromCaenorhabditis elegans (13Takagi T. Moore C. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The 573-amino acid nematode protein consists of a carboxyl-terminal domain homologous to yeast Ceg1 and an amino-terminal domain that has strong similarity to the superfamily of protein phosphatases that act via a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate. We recently isolated a mouse cDNA encoding the mammalian homologue of the C. elegans capping enzyme (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The 597-amino acid mouse capping enzyme (Mce1) also consists of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. Here, we report that Mce1 is functionalin vitro and in vivo. An autonomous RNA triphosphatase domain (amino acids 1–210) and an autonomous guanylyltransferase domain (amino acids 211–597) have been purified and characterized. We found that the guanylyltransferase domainper se binds to the pol II CTD and that this interaction requires CTD phosphorylation. The triphosphatase domain of mouse capping enzyme does not bind to the CTD. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between guanylyltransferase and the CTD is conserved from yeast to mammals and provides a general mechanism for targeting caps to nascent pol II transcripts in vivo. The MCE1 cDNA was cloned into a customized yeast expression vector, pYX1-His, a derivative of pYX132 (CEN TRP1) in which six consecutive histidine codons and a unique NdeI site are inserted between the NcoI and BamHI sites of pYX132 (pYX-132 was purchased from Novagen). The DNA insert of the resulting plasmid pYX1-MCE1 extended from the Mce1 translation start codon to anXhoI site located in the 3′ UTR. pYX1-MCE1 encodes the full-length 597-amino acid Mce1 polypeptide fused in-frame with an amino-terminal 12-amino acid leader peptide (MGSHHHHHHSGH). MCE1 expression in this plasmid was under the control of a constitutive yeast TPI promoter. Amino-terminal deletion mutants of MCE1 were constructed by PCR amplification with mutagenic primers that introduced an NdeI restriction site and a methionine codon in lieu of the codons for Ser-210 or Gln-259 or an NdeI site at Met-276. The PCR products were digested withNdeI and BglII and then inserted into pYX1-MCE1 so as to replace a 1.0-kilobase pair NdeI-BglII fragment of the wild type MCE1 gene with restriction fragments encoding deleted Mce1 polypeptides. The mutated genes were named according to the amino acid coordinates of their polypeptide products, i.e. MCE1(211–597), MCE1(260–597), and MCE1(276–597). Alanine-substitution mutations (C126A and K294A) in MCE1 were programmed by synthetic oligonucleotides using the two-stage overlap extension method (15Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). pYX1-MCE1 served as the template for the first round of amplification. The second-stage PCR products of the C126A and K294A reactions were digested with NdeI and BglII orNdeI and HindIII, respectively, and then ligated into the corresponding sites in pYX1-MCE1 in place of the wild type fragments. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed in every case by dideoxy sequencing. We sequenced the entire restriction fragment insert in each pXY1 plasmid to exclude the introduction of unwanted mutations. A CEN TRP1 vector, pYX1-CEG1, encoding yeast Ceg1 under the control of a TPI promoter, was constructed by inserting an NcoI-HindIII fragment of plasmid pGYCE-360 (16Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) into pYX132. Strain YBS2 (MAT a ura3 trp1 lys2 leu2 ceg1::hisGpGYCE-360), which is deleted at the chromosomal CEG1 locus, is viable when it maintains an extrachromosomal copy of CEG1on a CEN URA3 plasmid (pGYCE-360) (16Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4328-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). YBS2 was transformed with pXY1-based plasmids bearing wild type and mutant alleles ofMCE1. Trp+ transformants were selected on medium lacking tryptophan. Individual colonies were patched on medium lacking tryptophan. Cells from single patches were then streaked on medium containing 0.75 mg/ml of 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA). The plates were incubated at 30 °C. Mutations scored as lethal were those that did not support colony formation after 7 days. Individual colonies of the viable MCE1 alleles were picked from the 5-FOA plate and patched to plates lacking tryptophan. All 5-FOA survivors were confirmed to be Ura−. NdeI-XhoI fragments of pYX1-MCE1, pYX1-MCE1(211–597), pYX1-MCE1(260–597), and pYX1-MCE1(276–597) were inserted into to the T7-based expression plasmid pET16b (Novagen). The carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant MCE1(1–210) was constructed by PCR amplification from an MCE1 template with an antisense primer that introduced a translation stop at codon 211 and a flanking XhoI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with NdeI and XhoI and inserted into pET16b. A 25-ml culture of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-MCE1 was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the A600 reached 0.5. The culture was adjusted to 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and incubation was continued at 17 °C for 17 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was stored at −80 °C. All subsequent procedures were performed at 4 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, 10% sucrose). Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml; the suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min and then sonicated for 30 s. Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.1%, and sonication was repeated to reduce the viscosity of the lysate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 45 min at 18,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The soluble extract was applied to a 0.5-ml column of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The column was washed with the same buffer and then eluted step-wise with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1m NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The polypeptide compositions of the column fractions were monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The recombinant Mce1 polypeptide was retained on the column and recovered in the 200 and 500 mm imidazole eluates. These two fractions were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Triton X-100). 500-ml cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pET-MCE1(1–210) or pET-MCE1(211–597) were grown at 37 °C until the A600 reached 0.5. The cultures were adjusted to 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C. Thawed bacteria were resuspended in 25 ml of Buffer A. Soluble lysates were prepared as described in the preceding section and then applied to 4-ml columns of Ni-NTA-agarose, which were eluted step-wise with 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mm imidazole. The Mce1(1–210) and Mce1(211–597) polypeptides were retained on the Ni-NTA-agarose columns and recovered in the 200 and 500 mmimidazole eluates. The preparations were dialyzed against Buffer C. Enzyme fractions were stored at −80 °C and thawed on ice just prior to use. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad dye binding assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots (200 μl) of the dialyzed Ni-agarose preparations of Mce1, Mce1(1–210), and Mce1(211–597) were applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradients containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected from the bottom of the tube. Marker proteins catalase, bovine serum albumin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and cytochrome C were sedimented in a parallel gradient. Standard reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmDTT, 5 mm MgCl2, [α32P]GTP as specified, and enzyme were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were halted by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1%. The samples were electrophoresed through a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Enzyme-[32P]GMP complexes were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the dried gel and was quantitated by scanning the gel with a FUJIX BAS1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. RNA triphosphatase activity was assayed by liberation of 32Pi from γ-32P-labeled triphosphate-terminated poly(A) (17Shuman S. Surks M. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11588-11598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm DTT, 10 pmol (of triphosphate termini) of [γ-32P]poly(A), and enzyme as specified were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions was halted by addition of 1 μl of 12 n formic acid. Aliquots of the mixtures were applied to a polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC plate that was developed with 0.75 m potassium phosphate (pH 4.3). The release of 32Pi from [γ-32P]poly(A) was quantitated by scanning the TLC plate with a FUJIX BAS1000 Bio-Imaging Analyzer. Recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-CTD, consisting of glutathione-S-transferase fused to the first 15 tandem heptad repeats from the mouse pol II CTD (consensus sequence YSPTSPS), was purified and coupled to glutathione agarose as described (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). GST-CTD was phosphorylated in vitro by incubation with HeLa cell extract and ATP (2McCracken S. Fong N. Rosonina E. Yankulov K. Brothers G. Siderovski D. Hessel A. Foster S. Shuman S. Bentley D.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3306-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation reaction resulted in the addition of approximately 3 phosphates per molecule of GST-CTD. The GST-CTD-PO4 polypeptide was adsorbed to glutathione agarose and the resin was washed with buffer containing 1 m NaCl prior to use in affinity chromatography. The GST-CTD and GST-CTD-PO4 resins contained 3.0 mg of fusion protein per ml of agarose. Affinity chromatography was performed by mixing 25 μl of GST-CTD or GST-CTD-PO4 resins with 180–200-μl samples of Mce1 proteins in binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5 μm microcystine, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. After mixing for 1 h at 4 °C, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. The resins were washed three or four times with 400–500 μl of binding buffer, and then the bound material was eluted with 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.9 m NaCl. Aliquots of the input sample and the 0.9 m NaCl eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. We have isolated a mouse cDNA that encodes Mce1, a putative mRNA capping enzyme (GenBankTM accession no. AF034568). The size of the Mce1 polypeptide (597-amino acids; 68 kDa) agrees with the size of the 68-kDa enzyme-GMP complex formed by the capping enzyme isolated from mouse cell extracts (18Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7237-7245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of Mce1 suggests that it is a bifunctional enzyme consisting of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase domain. In this respect, it resembles the C. elegans capping enzyme (13Takagi T. Moore C. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), to which it displays 43% sequence identity. The carboxyl-terminal portion of Mce1 contains the defining sequence motifs of the covalent nucleotidyl transferase superfamily (9Shuman S. Schwer B. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), including theK XDGXR sequence that constitutes the active site. The lysine side chain within this motif (Lys-294 in Mce1) reacts with GTP to form a covalent enzyme-GMP intermediate. The amino-terminal portion of Mce1 contains the (I/V)HC XAGXGR(S/T)G signature motif of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase/protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme family. These proteins catalyze phosphoryl transfer from a protein phosphomonoester substrate to the thiol of a cysteine on the enzyme to form a covalent phosphocysteine intermediate, which is then attacked by water to liberate phosphate (19Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The cysteine within the signature motif is the active site of phosphoryl transfer and is thus essential for reaction chemistry. Cys-126 is predicted to be the active site of phosphoryl transfer by Mce1. The biochemical properties of the mammalian capping enzyme were examined after expressing Mce1 and its component domains in bacteria. First, the full-length MCE1 coding sequence was inserted into an inducible T7 RNA polymerase-based pET vector such that a histidine-rich amino-terminal leader (His-tag) was fused to the 597-amino acid Mce1 polypeptide. The pET-Mce1 plasmid was introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain that contains the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of a lacUV5 promoter. A 68-kDa polypeptide corresponding to His-tagged Mce1 was detected by SDS-PAGE in whole-cell and soluble lysates of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacteria (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). To assay guanylyltransferase activity of the expressed Mce1 protein, we incubated soluble protein from induced bacteria in the presence of [α-32P]GTP and a divalent cation. This resulted in the formation of a 32P-labeled nucleotidyl-protein adduct that migrated as a 68-kDa species during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). Three other polypeptides in the range of 45–55 kDa were labeled with GMP to a lesser extent. We detected no label transfer from GTP to polypeptides of these sizes in extracts prepared from bacteria that lacked the MCE1 gene (not shown). Purification of the His-tagged 68-kDa Mce1 guanylyltransferase was achieved by adsorption to Ni-agarose and elution with 200–500 mm imidazole (Fig. 1 A). The imidazole eluate fractions were highly enriched with respect to Mce1, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A, left panel). Note that the lower molecular weight polypeptides with guanylyltransferase activity were recovered in the Ni-agarose flow-through and wash fractions (Fig. 1 A, right panel), which suggested that these were proteolytic fragments of Mce1 that lacked the amino-terminal His-tag. The Ni-agarose Mce1 preparation was centrifuged through a 15–30% glycerol gradient. The fractions were assayed for enzyme-GMP complex formation and for RNA triphosphatase. The latter activity was detected by the release of 32Pi from γ32P-labeled poly(A). A single peak of guanylyltransferase activity was coincident with the RNA triphosphatase activity profile (Fig. 2 A). Mce1 sedimented at 3.9 S relative to marker proteins centrifuged in a parallel gradient. We surmise from this experiment that recombinant Mce1 is a bifunctional monomeric enzyme. To evaluate whether the carboxyl-terminal portion of Mce1 constituted an autonomous functional guanylyltransferase domain, we expressed the protein segment from residues 211–597 as a His-tagged fusion protein. The choice of residue 211 as a domain breakpoint was based on its location 84 amino acids from the putative Mce1 active site Lys-294; the active site lysine of the monofunctionalChlorella virus guanylyltransferase is located 82 amino acids from its amino terminus (20Ho C.K. Van Etten J.L. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6658-6664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hakansson K. Doherty A.J. Shuman S. Wigley D.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We found that isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacteria accumulated substantial amounts of a soluble 46-kDa polypeptide corresponding to Mce1(211–597), which reacted with [α-32P]GTP to form a 47-kDa radiolabeled enzyme-GMP adduct (Fig. 1 B). Mce1(211–597) adsorbed to Ni-agarose and was eluted at 200–500 mm imidazole (Fig. 1 B). Mce1(211–597) sedimented as a discrete 2.8 S peak during glycerol gradient centrifugation (Fig. 2 B). We surmise that Mce1 the guanylyltransferase component is a monomer in solution. Induced expression of the amino-terminal portion of Mce1 from residues 1–210 as a His-tagged fusion protein resulted in the accumulation of a soluble 28-kDa polypeptide that could be adsorbed to Ni-agarose and eluted with 200–500 mm imidazole (Fig. 3 A). Mce1(1–210) was recovered in nearly homogeneous form at this stage. The Ni-agarose preparation was highly active as an RNA triphosphatase (see below). As one might expect, Mce1(1–210) was incapable of forming a covalent adduct with [α-32P]GTP (not shown). Mce1(1–210) sedimented in a glycerol gradient as a discrete peak of 2.5S (Fig. 3 B). The RNA triphosphatase activity profile coincided with the abundance of the 28-kDa Mce1(1–210) polypeptide. We conclude from these experiments that the mammalian capping enzyme is composed of autonomous nonoverlapping triphosphatase and guanylyltransferase domains. The standard RNA triphosphatase reaction contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 μm γ32P-labeled poly(A). The extent of γ-phosphate hydrolysis during a 15-min incubation at 37 °C was proportional to input Mce1(1–210) (Fig. 4 A). In the linear range of enzyme dependence, 1 pmol of 32Pi was released per fmol of protein. The specific activity of the Ni-agarose preparation was 37 units/μg. (One unit of enzyme releases 1 nmol of32Pi from γ32P poly(A) in 15 min.) A kinetic analysis showed that the initial rate of Pirelease was proportional to enzyme concentration (Fig. 4 B). Mce1(1–210) hydrolyzed 1.2–2 molecules of Pi/enzyme/s at steady state. RNA triphosphatase activity was optimal in 50 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.0–7.5; the extents of γ-phosphate release at pH 6.0 and pH 9.5 were 70 and 35%, respectively, of the activity seen at pH 7.5 (not shown). Activity was optimal in the absence of a divalent cation and was unaffected by EDTA. Inclusion of divalent cations elicited a concentration-dependent inhibition of RNA triphosphatase activity (Fig. 4 C). 75% inhibition was observed at 0.5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2. Mce1(1–210) did not catalyze release of32Pi from [γ-32P]ATP (not shown). Formation of the covalent enzyme-GMP complex by Mce1(211–597) was dependent on the concentration of GTP from 0.01 to 2 μm (Fig. 5 A). The yield of guanylated enzyme plateaued at 5–10 μm GTP; we estimated that at least 30% of the enzyme molecules were labeled with GMP in vitro. (It has been our experience that a significant fraction of any recombinant guanylyltransferase purified from bacteria is already guanylylated and thus cannot be labeled during the in vitroreaction.) Enzyme-GMP complex formation was strictly dependent on a divalent cation cofactor. Either magnesium or manganese sufficed; activity was optimal at 1–2 mm MnCl2 or 5–10 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 5 B). The rate of enzyme-guanylate formation was slightly greater in the presence of manganese versus magnesium (Fig. 5 C). The Ni-agarose preparation of Mce1(211–597) displayed trace levels of RNA triphosphatase activity. The specific activity (0.02 units/μg of protein) was 0.05% that of Mce1(1–210). The residual triphosphatase was resolved from the guanylyltransferase activity during glycerol gradient sedimentation of Mce1(211–597), suggesting that this phosphatase was an E. coli contaminant. We surmise that the guanylyltransferase domain of Mce1 has no triphosphatase activityper se. To confirm that the Mce1 domains actually catalyzed cap formation on triphosphate RNA ends, we incubated Mce1(1–210) and Mce1(211–597) together with unlabeled triphosphate-terminated poly(A) in the presence of [α-32P]GTP and 0.1 mm MnCl2. The RNA was recovered free of GTP by several rounds of TCA precipitation, and then deproteinized and ethanol precipitated. Digestion of the labeled RNA with nuclease P1 liberated a single labeled species that migrated during PEI cellulose thin layer chromatography with GpppA (not shown). To test whether the mouse capping enzyme was functional in vivo, we examined the ability of the wild type full-length MCE1 cDNA to complement aceg1 null mutation by using the plasmid shuffle technique (6Shuman S. Liu Y. Schwer B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12046-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Schwer B. Shuman S. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S.

The MCE1 plasmid was introduced into YBS2, a yeast strain in which the chromosomal CEG1locus is deleted and that is dependent for growth on maintenance of an extrachromosomal copy of CEG1 on a CEN URA3plasmid. Trp+ transformants were plated on medium containing 5-FOA to select against retention of the wild type CEG1 gene. Cells bearing the TRP1 MCE1 plasmid grew readily on 5-FOA, whereas cells containing the TRP1 vector plasmid were incapable of growth on 5-FOA. A mutated allele, MCE1-K294A, in which the active site nucleophile of the guanylyltransferase Lys-294 was substituted by alanine, was"

One of the putative cell-matrix adhesion molecules present in the HD is the 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen (BP180), also termed type XVII collagen. In our previous study, using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1337, we have detected a 120-kDa collagenase-sensitive polypeptide in the HD fraction (Uematsu, J. and Owaribe, K. (1993)Cell Struct. Funct. 18, 588 (abstr.)). The present study was undertaken to assess the relation of the 120-kDa polypeptide to this BP180. Immunofluorescence microscopy of bovine skin revealed the basement membrane zone of skin to be stained clearly with mAb 1337, whereas the lateral surfaces of basal cells, which were decorated by typical antibodies against BP180, were not. The antibody did not detect HDs in cultured cells but rather in the culture medium. These results indicate a localization of mAb 1337 antigen distinct from BP180. However, the same polypeptide was also recognized by monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular but not the cytoplasmic part of BP180, and found to react with a polyclonal antibody against the non-collagenous 16A domain of BP180. Therefore, the polypeptide was identified as an extracellular fragment of BP180. mAb 1337 immunoprecipitated the 120-kDa fragment from the medium, but not the 180-kDa molecule of BP180 extracted from cultured cells, indicating that the antibody specifically recognizes the fragment. The mAb 1337 apparently recognizes a unique epitope that is exposed or formed by the cleavage. Hence, the staining pattern observed for bovine skin demonstrated the presence of the 120-kDa extracellular fragment. Rotary shadow electron microscopy of affinity-purified 120-kDa fragments demonstrated that they have the unique molecular shape consisting of a central rod and a flexible tail, without the globular head that is present in the BP180 molecule. From these results, we conclude that mAb 1337 shows unique epitope specificity, recognizing only the 120-kDa extracellular fragment of BP180, which is constitutively cleaved on the cell surface as a 120-kDa fragment both in in vivo and in vitro.

Hemidesmosomes, including anchoring filaments and fibrils, are adhesion complexes mediating firm attachment of epithelial basal cells to the underlying basement membrane, thereby mechanically linking the cytoplasmic keratin filament network to collagen fibrils and other extracellular matrix components of the connective tissue (1Garrod D.

In the past decade, several hemidesmosomal constituents have been identified and it has been possible to elucidate the cellular regulation of hemidesmosomes at the molecular level. In the process of epidermal organization and differentiation, cells dynamically regulate their hemidesmosomes during attachment to and detachment from the basement membrane. In most cases, this involves new formation of hemidesmosomes, but, during cell movement in wound healing and differentiation in stratification, hemidesmosomes must become detached from the basement membrane, with separation of hemidesmosomal transmembrane proteins from their ligands being an important step. However, the underlying mechanism is still poorly understood. There are at least three hemidesmosomal transmembrane polypeptides,i.e. integrin α6 and β4 subunits (4Stepp M.A. Spurr-Michaud S.

Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have shown that integrin α6 subunit interacts with BP180. On the other hand, Borradori et al. (19Borradori L. Koch P.J.

These results suggest that the α6β4 complex plays a major role in epidermal cell-basement membrane adhesion. BP180, a 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigen, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a collagenous carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain and a noncollagenous amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain (7Giudice G.J.

The extracellular domain is interrupted by non-triple-helical sequences, consisting of 15 separate triple-helical stretches in the human form and 13 in the mouse. Autoantibodies to BP180 are thought to play a crucial role in skin blistering in patients with bullous pemphigoid, herpes gestationis, and cicatricial pemphigoid (22Stanley J.R. Adv.

However, while these results suggest an important role for BP180 in cell to extracellular matrix adhesion, in contrast to integrin α6β4, our understanding of the molecular biology of BP180 is quite limited, and even its ligand(s) is unknown. In our preliminary studies, we have detected a novel 120-kDa hemidesmosomal component, specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BMZ, basement membrane zone; LAD, linear IgA bullous dermatosis; HD, hemidesmosome. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; BMZ, basement membrane zone; LAD, linear IgA bullous dermatosis; HD, hemidesmosome. termed 1337 (30Uematsu J. Owaribe K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18 (abstr.): 588Google Scholar). The component was found to be present primarily in stratified epithelia by immunofluorescence microscopy. The fact that it was lost by collagenase treatment, suggesting a collagen nature is the rationale for the present examination of the relationship between the 120-kDa polypeptide and BP180. We present evidence here that the 120-kDa polypeptide is indeed derived from BP180 and that, both in tissue and in culture, cells can sever this extracellular portion of the molecule from their surfaces. The biological and clinical significance of this finding is also considered. Mouse mAbs against hemidesmosomal proteins were prepared by immunizing mice with the hemidesmosome fraction isolated from bovine corneal epithelial cells, as described previously (31Owaribe K. Nishizawa Y. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). mAb 233, mAb 1D1, mAb D20, and mAb R223 are against the extracellular part, and mAb 1A8c and mAb 1A6 are against the cytoplasmic part of BP180 (Fig. 1) (21Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 113: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Epitopes of mAb 233 and mAb 1D1 are mapped on the carboxyl-terminal half, and that of mAb D20 is mapped on the amino-terminal half of the extracellular part. 2Y. Hirako and K. Owaribe, unpublished data. mAb 1E5 binds specifically to BP230. mAb 855, mAb 310, and mAb 617 target the extracellular part and mAb 1A3 targets the cytoplasmic part of the integrin β4 subunit. For immunofluorescence microscopy, hybridoma supernatants of each mAb were diluted to 50 times their antibody titers, i.e. 50-fold the critical concentration to detect the antigen in skin basement membrane zone (BMZ) by immunofluorescence microscopy. Purified ascites fluid of mAb 233 was biotinylated for some experiments. The purified immunoglobulin fraction of mAb 233 was mixed with sulfosuccinimidobiotin in 0.1 m HEPES buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm NaCl to a biotin/mAb 233 molar ratio of 20. After incubation for 60 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the fraction containing biotinylated antibody was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Mouse polyclonal anti-NC16A antibody was prepared by immunizing a mouse with the human NC16A domain fused with glutathioneS-transferase (32Matsumura K. Amagai M. Nishikawa T. Hashimoto T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1996; 288: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). BMGE+H and BMGE−H cells, mammary gland epithelial cell lines derived from a lactating bovine udder, were the kind gift of Dr. W. W. Franke of the German Cancer Research Center (Heidelberg, Germany) (33Schmid E. Schiller D.L. Grund C. Stadler J. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The DJM-1 cell is an isolated cell line from human skin squamous cell carcinoma (34Kitajima Y. Inoue S. Nagao S. Nagata K. Yaoita H. Nozawa Y. Cancer Res. 1988; 98: 964-970Google Scholar). A431 cells of an epidermal cell carcinoma cell line derived from human vulva were obtained from the Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). Cell culture conditions were as described previously (35Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared tissues were snap-frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen. Sections from frozen specimens were cut at 5–6 μm with a cryostat, mounted on glass slides, air-dried, and fixed in 100% acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. In some cases the sections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 or 1.5 m KCl in phosphate-buffered saline before fixation. Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with acetone. These fixed sections and cells were processed for immunofluorescence staining as described previously (35Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from dishes, and homogenized on ice in a lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. After extraction for 30 min on ice, cells were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant supernatants were collected as cytosolic fractions. Then residual pellets were resuspended and extracted in a low salt buffer solution (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing nonionic detergent 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and were centrifuged to yield Triton X-100-soluble membrane-bound (supernatant) and Triton X-100-insoluble (pellet) fractions. Cytoskeletal fractions were recovered from pellets by resuspension of Triton X-100-insoluble fractions in a high salt buffer solution (1.5 m KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Conditioned medium collected from 3-day cultures was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min to remove unattached cells and 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm N-ethylmaleimide were added. Proteins were precipitated by the addition of saturated ammonium sulfate solution (half the volume of the medium). Precipitates were resuspended in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA as the medium fractions. In some experiments, the spent medium was precipitated first with 50% ammonium sulfate for concentration, and subsequently the precipitant dissolved in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA was precipitated with 33% ammonium sulfate. For immunoprecipitation, the resuspension buffer for the medium fractions was changed to a low salt buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, to equalize the buffer conditions for the Triton X-100-soluble membrane-bound fractions. Hemidesmosomes were isolated from bovine corneal epithelial cells, as described previously (31Owaribe K. Nishizawa Y. Franke W.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Amano Pharmaceutical, Nagoya, Japan) was added at 50 Mandle units/ml final concentration to the HD fraction isolated from corneas of 30 bovine eyes. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C, the enzymatic reaction was stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer. SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli with a slight modification (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using SDS-PAGE and subsequent electrophoretic transfer onto nitrocellulose sheets using a semidry system as described previously (37Hieda Y. Nishizawa Y. Uematsu J. Owaribe K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 12 ml of Triton X-100-soluble fraction and 1.2 ml of medium fraction were prepared from three 15-cm dishes of BMGE+H cells as described above. The prepared fractions were divided into four aliquots. Each aliquot was supplemented with 3 ml of hybridoma supernatant, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, mixed with 400 μl of second antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (American Qualex International Inc., La Mirada, CA), and incubated for an additional 1 h. The agarose beads were washed with the same washing buffers used for the immunoblotting. After removal of the supernatant by centrifugation, aliquots were added to 150 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerin). The agarose beads were then suspended and boiled for 2 min. After the addition of β-mercaptoethanol, the polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose sheets. The sheets were incubated with 1% BSA in TBS (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Tween-TBS) and subsequently with biotinylated mAb 233 for 90 min. After washing with Tween-TBS, they were incubated with alkaline phosphatase-labeled avidin for 60 min, followed by visualization with nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Ascites fluid of mAb 233 and mAb 1A8c were purified with an Ampure™ PA kit (Amersham, Tokyo, Japan) and the immunoglobulin fractions were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). The Triton X-100-soluble membrane-bound fraction of DJM-1 cells prepared from 10 dishes (15 cm diameter) was applied to an mAb 1A8c immunoaffinity column (2 ml) and washed with a washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.6 mNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1% Triton X-100). The medium fraction prepared from 500 ml of conditioned cultured medium of DJM-1 cells was applied to an mAb 233 immunoaffinity column (2 ml) and washed with a washing buffer (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). Bound antigens were eluted with 3 m NaSCN containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and the eluted fractions were dialyzed against a low salt buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The purity of the eluted fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE using silver staining and immunoblotting. Affinity-purified samples were mixed with 50% glycerol, and samples were sprayed, using an air brush, onto freshly cleaved mica. The droplets on the mica were dried at room temperature in a vacuum at 10−8 mmHg in newly developed freeze-etch equipment (Hitachi HR7000) for 10 min. Dried specimens were rotary-shadowed with platinum using an electron gun positioned at 2.5° to the mica surface, and then coated with a film of carbon generated by an electron gun positioned at 90° to the mica surface. The replica was floated on distilled water and collected on a grid covered with Formvar film. The specimens were examined with a JEM 100CX electron microscope. The mAb 1337 is a monoclonal antibody obtained by immunizing a mouse with the HD fraction, and stained BMZ of bovine epidermis in immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis of the HD fraction showed that the antibody recognized a 120-kDa polypeptide as described previously in our preliminary report (Fig. 2) (30Uematsu J. Owaribe K. Cell Struct. Funct. 1993; 18 (abstr.): 588Google Scholar). To confirm the previous results and further characterize the antigen, the HD fraction was treated with collagenase and examined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2). The 120-kDa band was completely lost by collagenase digestion as reported previously, showing that the polypeptide has a collagenous domain(s) as BP180 do. Hence, we investigated the 120-kDa polypeptide with special reference to BP180, a hemidesmosomal transmembrane collagen. As shown in Fig. 2, immunoblotting with mAbs against extracellular parts of BP180 showed the electrophoretic mobility of the antigen to be equal to that of the smallest polypeptide among a group of proteolytic fragments appearing in the HD fraction. On two-dimensional SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting, the antigen and the BP180 fragment showed an identical spot (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that mAb 1337 recognizes primarily the 120-kDa fragment of BP180 on immunoblotting. To examine whether the mAb 1337 specifically recognizes the 120-kDa fragment of BP180 by immunofluorescence microscopy, the staining pattern of mAb 1337 was compared with those of mAbs against BP180. The titers among the mAbs were equalized to allow comparative observations. The mAb 1337 clearly stained the BMZ of bovine skin, as did the other mAbs to BP180, but, in contrast, not the lateral surfaces of the basal cells (Fig. 3,A–D). Thus, mAb 1337 did not recognize Triton X-100-soluble BP180, which is free from the cytoskeleton and not incorporated into HDs (35Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy of BMGE+H cells and primary cultured bovine conjunctival epithelial cells (data not shown) showed that mAb 1337 did not detect HDs (Fig. 4), pointing to a lack of binding to insoluble BP180. These results are quite different from those with other typical anti-BP180 mAbs, and suggest that mAb 1337 does not recognize intact BP180 in either soluble or insoluble states. Therefore, its staining pattern observed in bovine skin indicates the presence of the 120-kDa fragment. When frozen sections of bovine skin were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 or 1.5 m KCl and stained with mAb 1337, the immunofluorescent staining was essentially the same as in control sections, showing that the 120-kDa fragments are largely insolubilized in the tissue (Fig. 3, E–H).Figure 4Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells. BMGE+H cells were stained with mAb 1337 (A) and mAb 233 (B). Phase contrast images of A and B, respectively, are illustrated in C and D. HDs recognized by mAb 233 (B) were not detected by mAb 1337 (A). Bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Immunofluorescence microscopy with mAb 1337 showed the antigenic fragment to be lacking or present at only a very low level on BMGE+H cells (Fig. 4). If the fragment does not have a transmembrane domain nor cytoplasmic part, diffusion into the culture medium would be expected. To examine this possibility, spent media from BMGE+H cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using mAb 1D1, a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular part of BP180, and a specific band of 120 kDa was detected (Fig. 5 A). This polypeptide was concentrated in the fraction precipitated with 33% ammonium sulfate, and was also recognized by mAb 1337 and mAb 233, but not by mAb 1A8c, which recognizes the cytoplasmic part of BP180 (Fig. 5 A). The electrophoretic mobility of the 120-kDa polypeptide proved equal to that of the fragment from the HD fraction. Therefore, the polypeptide in the spent medium was concluded to be the 120-kDa fragment of the HD fraction. The 120-kDa polypeptide appeared prone to degradation to a 100-kDa polypeptide when the spent medium was precipitated first with 50% ammonium sulfate for concentration, and consequently the precipitant dissolved in TBS containing 1 mm EDTA was precipitated with 33% ammonium sulfate. The 100-kDa polypeptide was recognized by mAb 1337 and 233, but not by mAb 1D1, the epitope of which appeared to be removed (Fig. 5 B). In accordance with these results, no polypeptide was recognized in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction by immunoblot analysis with mAb 1337 (Fig. 6). Both mAb 233 and 1D1 recognized the 120-kDa polypeptide of the medium fraction as well as the 180-kDa polypeptide in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, while mAb 1A8c did not recognize the 120-kDa polypeptide. The molar ratio of the 120-kDa polypeptide, Triton X-100-soluble BP180, and Triton X-100-insoluble BP180 was roughly 1:6:3 in BMGE+H cells. The approximately 60-kDa component recognized by mAb 1A8c should be noted (Fig. 6 E). This 60-kDa polypeptide was not recognized by either mAb 233 or 1D1, and its apparent molecular mass and specific recognition by mAb 1A8c indicate that it mainly comprises the cytoplasmic part of BP180. Since the 60-kDa polypeptide was not detected in the cytosolic fraction but in both Triton X-100-soluble membrane-bound and insoluble fractions, it would appear to have a transmembrane domain. On the other hand, the soluble form of BP230, a hemidesmosomal plaque component, was detected in the cytosolic fraction but not in Triton X-100-soluble membrane-bound fraction (Fig. 6 F). It is reasonable to assume that the 60-kDa polypeptide is the fragment that remains after cleavage of the 120-kDa extracellular part from BP180. Therefore, considering the apparent molecular mass of the two fragments, the cleavage site(s) is probably on the extracellular side near the cell membrane. Trimer formation by the 120-kDa fragment was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 7). When the membrane-bound fraction in SDS-PAGE sample solution was not boiled, a 600-kDa component was detected for BP180. The apparent molecular mass is equal to that of the chemically cross-linked trimers of BP180 described previously (35Hirako Y. Usukura J. Nishizawa Y. Owaribe K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13739-13745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the non-boiled condition, BP180 molecules exist in a trimer form, probably due to the collagen links. In the non-boiled condition, the 120-kDa fragment in the medium fraction was detected as a 350-kDa component. Since this molecular mass is consistent with a trimer of the fragment, it is concluded that the fragment exists as trimer form. mAb 1337 recognized the fragment in both monomer and trimer forms, but did not recognize the intact 180-kDa polypeptide. The immunoreactivity of mAb 1337 against the 120-kDa fragment and the intact BP180 molecule in their native soluble forms was examined by immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitants were also analyzed by immunoblotting with mAb 233. While mAb 233 precipitated both the intact molecule and the fragment, mAb 1337 precipitated o"

Because the daily variation in SGLT1 activity is established by the feeding schedule (whether ad libitum or imposed) and persists in the absence of food, this variation has been described as anticipatory. To delineate the mechanisms regulating SGLT1, its expression was examined in rats maintained in a 12-h photoperiod with free access to chow. SGLT1 mRNA levels varied significantly, with the maximum abundance occurring near the onset of dark and the minimum near the onset of light. The SGLT1 transcription rate was 7-fold higher in the morning (1000–1100 h) than in the afternoon (1600–1700 h). An element for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) was identified in the SGLT1 promoter that formed different complexes with small intestinal nuclear extracts, depending on the time when the source animal was killed. Serological tests indicated that HNF-1α was present in complexes throughout the day, while HNF-1β binding exhibited circadian periodicity. We propose that exchange of HNF-1 dimerization partners contributes to circadian changes in SGLT1 transcription. Because SGLT1 mRNA levels also varied in rhesus monkeys (offset by approximately one-half day from rats), a similar mechanism appears to be present in primates.

The central role of glucose in cellular metabolism has led to the evolution of two gene families of eukaryotic glucose transporters, each with a specific cell and tissue expression pattern to subserve its particular functions (for review, see Hediger and Rhoads (1Hediger M.A. Rhoads D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 993-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar)).

Facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs), which permit passive movement of glucose across plasma membranes down its concentration gradient, are generally expressed on serosal (basolateral) surfaces to release absorbed glucose into the bloodstream. Identification of several glucose transporters by cDNA cloning over the last several years has permitted characterization of the expression pattern and regulatory behavior of the individual glucose transporters. The high affinity SGLT1 is expressed in the apical membranes of the renal proximal tubule and the intestinal mucosa to (re)absorb glucose, which is released into the bloodstream via basolaterally expressed GLUT2- and GLUT1-facilitated glucose transporters (3Fukumoto H. Seino S. Imura H. Seino Y. Eddy R.L. Fukushima Y. Byers M.B. Shows T.B. Bell G.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Davidson N.O.

The intestine also expresses GLUT5 (7Kayano T. Burant C.F. Fukumoto H. Gould G.W. Fan Y.-S. Eddy R.L. Byers M.G. Shows T.B. Seino S. Bell G.I. J. Biol.

Intestinal glucose transporter expression in rodents exhibits circadian periodicity, induction by carbohydrate intake, and dysregulation in experimental diabetes. Glucose uptake activity in rats fed ad libitum peaks late in the dark phase (8Fisher R.B. Gardner M.L.G. J. Physiol. 1976; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or early in the light phase (9Stevenson N.R. Ferrigni R. Parnicky K. Day S. Fierstein J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 406: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and depends on the imposed feeding schedule rather than the light cycle (8Fisher R.B. Gardner M.L.G. J. Physiol. 1976; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Stevenson N.R. Fierstein J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 230: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Because the food consumption pattern in rats fedad libitum is established by the light cycle (11Siegel P.S. J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1961; 54: 294-301Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the circadian rhythmicity of glucose transport activity is “cued by feeding” (10Stevenson N.R. Fierstein J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1976; 230: 731-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) rather than the result of an inherent oscillatory behavior of the small intestine. Persistence of this periodicity in animals deprived of food has led to concept that this behavior is anticipatory, i.e. dependent on prior rather than current food intake (12Saito M. Murakami E. Nishida T. Fujisawa Y. Suda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recent demonstration of diurnal periodicities in the mRNA levels of SGLT1, GLUT2, and GLUT5 (13Corpe C.P. Burant C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G211-G216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that transcriptional changes may underlie this anticipation, but this hypothesis is as yet untested. Responsiveness of intestinal glucose transporter expression to carbohydrate intake has been explored by Ferraris et al. (14Ferraris R.P. Villenas S.A. Diamond J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1060-G1068PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ferraris R.P. Villenas S.A. Diamond J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1069-G1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ferraris R.P. Villenas S.A.

A. 1993; 90: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These authors reported that long term adaptation of mice to a high carbohydrate diet resulted in significantly more intestinal glucose transporters as assayed by the binding of phloridzin (a specific inhibitor of Na+/glucose cotransporters) (14Ferraris R.P. Villenas S.A. Diamond J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1060-G1068PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, from the kinetics of change in phloridzin binding along the crypt-villus axis in response to shifting from a no carbohydrate to a high carbohydrate diet (or vice versa), these authors proposed that enterocytes can alter glucose transporter expression only in response to carbohydrate availability as they exit the crypt (15Ferraris R.P. Villenas S.A. Diamond J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: G1069-G1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ferraris R.P. Diamond J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5868-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, whether changes occurred at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level was not addressed. Moreover, the modulation of SGLT1 expression in the absence of dietary shifts was not examined. In rats, a shift from a no carbohydrate to a high carbohydrate diet resulted in increased SGLT1 transcription over a 5-day period (18Miyamoto K.-i. Hase K. Takagi T. Fujii T. Taketani Y. Minami H. Oka T. Nakabou Y. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), but only one time point per day was examined. Finally, the up-regulation of the glucose transporter expression in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (19Karasov W.H. Diamond J.M. Johnson L.R. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract. 2. Raven Press, New York1987: 1489-1497Google Scholar) appears to be due to a premature induction of SGLT1 mRNA and protein along the crypt-villus axis (20Burant C.F. Flink S. DePaoli A.M. Chen J. Lee W.-S. Hediger M.A. Buse J.B. Chang E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying this induction are not known. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying SGLT1 regulation, we began by examining the influence of nutritional status (dietary carbohydrate content and fasting-refeeding) on intestinal SGLT1 mRNA levels. Remarkably, a distinct circadian rhythmicity in SGLT1 mRNA levels and transcription were observed in the absence of dietary manipulation. These findings place a specific interpretation on the anticipatory expression of digestive functions (12Saito M. Murakami E. Nishida T. Fujisawa Y. Suda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these data suggest that dietary influences regulating the SGLT1 gene and its pathological dysregulation are more complex than previously appreciated. 32P-Labeled nucleotides were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Antiserum recognizing all three rat C/EBP isoforms was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Rats were maintained in accordance with the NIHGuide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were housed in wire-bottomed cages within an AAALAC-accredited animal facility under an approved research protocol. The room was maintained at 21–22 °C with a 12-h photoperiod (0700–1900 h). Six-week-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (Taconic Farms, Taconic, NY) were adapted to the animal facility for at least 5 days prior to the initiation of any study. Animals were allowed ad libitumaccess to water and standard laboratory chow (Rodent Laboratory Chow, Purina 5001) throughout each study. Duodenal biopsies were obtained from three young adult female rhesus monkeys housed at the New England Regional Primate Research Center (Southborough, MA) under a protocol approved by Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. Monkeys were fasted for 12 h prior to biopsy under light general anesthesia (Telazol, 7.5 mg/kg). Five to six biopsies were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and later combined for extraction of RNA (see below). The following cDNA probes were used for Northern blot and transcription rate analyses: rat SGLT1 (21Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human SGLT1 (22Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), rat GLUT2 (23Thorens B. Sarkar H.K. Kaback H.R. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1988; 55: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), rat GLUT5 (24Rand E.B. DePaoli A.M. Davidson N.O. Bell G.I. Burant C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G1169-G1176PubMed Google Scholar), rat sucrase-isomaltase (25Traber P.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), rat liver-type pyruvate kinase (26Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8679-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), human c-myc (provided by E. Schmidt, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA), and rat α-tubulin (provided by A. Rustgi, Massachusetts General Hospital). Probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using MegaPrime (Amersham Corp.). For nuclear run-on transcription assay, plasmids were linearized and immobilized on Hybond-N membrane. pBSK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a negative control. For genomic cloning, a 127-ntBstXI fragment from the rat SGLT1 cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. U03120) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using MegaPrime and a synthetic nonamer complementary to the 3′-terminus of the upper strand instead of the random primers included in the kit. Under anesthesia, jejunums were removed, flushed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and everted, and the mucosa was scraped. One portion of mucosa was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen for later extraction of RNA (27Cathala G. Savouret J.-F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA (N. Y.). 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), while the other was used to prepare postnuclear membranes (see below). Equal amounts (20 μg) of RNA were loaded per lane on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels. After electrophoresis, the RNA integrity was confirmed by ethidium bromide staining, and the RNA was transferred to Hybond-N filters (Amersham Corp.). Following hybridization in Rapid-Hybe buffer (Amersham Corp.), blots were washed three times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) for 10 min at room temperature, once in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, three times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C, and exposed on Kodak XAR-5 film at −80 °C with double intensifying screens. To detect different mRNAs, probes were stripped from filters by boiling in 0.1% SDS. Filters were successfully probed four times without loss of sensitivity. Densitometry was performed using NIH Image software. Postnuclear membranes were prepared from isolated intestinal mucosal cells (see below) according to the method described by Burant et al. (20Burant C.F. Flink S. DePaoli A.M. Chen J. Lee W.-S. Hediger M.A. Buse J.B. Chang E.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of membrane protein (10 μg) as estimated by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12% gel), and electrophoretically transferred to PVDF-Plus membrane filter (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA). SGLT1 protein was detected using a 1:7000 dilution of antiserum raised against the rabbit SGLT1 peptide sequence (amino acids 604–615) (28Hirayama B.A. Wong H.C. Smith C.D. Hagenbuch B.A. Hediger M.A. Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C296-C304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the Western LightTM chemiluminescence detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Mucosal cells were isolated from intestinal villi at 4 °C (29Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The three villus tip fractions (V1, V2, and V3) following the first wash (Vw) were combined and recovered by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 × g. Cells were lysed on ice in 15 ml of lysis buffer (Tris-Cl, 10 mm, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) with 10 gentle strokes in a Dounce homogenizer using the loose (B) pestle. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 500 × g, carefully suspended in 1 volume of storage buffer (Tris-Cl, 50 mm, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 40% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA), and stored at −80 °C in 200-μl aliquots. Transcription rate assays were performed by a modification of the method of Greenberg (30Greenberg M.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1990: 4.10.1-4.10.9Google Scholar). Following quantitation of incorporation, an equal number of disintegrations/min from each sample were precipitated for 30 min with 0.4 m LiCl and 2 volumes of ethanol at −80 °C, then recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The RNA samples were dissolved in 1.0 ml of Rapid-Hybe buffer, transferred to siliconized glass scintillation vials containing the filter-bound plasmids (5 μg each), and hybridized for 20 h at 65 °C. Following washing, the filters were exposed to ReflectionTM film (NEN Life Science Products). Extracts were prepared from isolated small intestinal epithelial cell nuclei by a modification of the method of Dignam et al. (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9144) Google Scholar). Extraction was performed with 2 volumes of buffer C (25 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.4m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) containing 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and antipain. Debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 15 min, dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Na-Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) for 3–4 h, and centrifuged again prior to storage at −80 °C. A rat genomic library (500,000 plaques; CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the SGLT1 BstXI fragment using protocols provided by the supplier. Of approximately 20 positive clones identified, sequence analysis (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) indicated that clone λ-H2 contained a 17-kb insert that included Exon 1. EMSAs were performed using a modification of the method of Bernards (32Bernards R. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions with 10 μg of protein, 125 ng of salmon testis DNA (Sigma), and 10,000 cpm double-stranded oligonucleotide probe were prepared on ice, incubated at room temperature for 15 min, and electrophoresed for 45 min in a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in a MiniProtean II gel electrophoresis apparatus (Bio-Rad). Binding buffer consisted of Na-Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. Electrophoresis buffer was 0.5× TBE (1× TBE is 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, pH 8.3, and 2 mm EDTA). The probe was prepared by annealing complementary synthetic oligonucleotides, 32P-end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and purified by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Antisera to HNF-1 isoforms α and β were provided by Dr. G. R. Crabtree (33Courtois G. Morgan J.G. Campbell L.A. Fourel G. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1987; 238: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and 0.5 μl was added to each indicated binding reaction. To examine the regulation of the SGLT1 gene, we initially tested two protocols to assess the influence of dietary carbohydrate on intestinal SGLT1 mRNA abundance: varying the carbohydrate content in the chow and fasting/refeeding. While both interventions altered mRNA levels, temporal changes in mRNA abundance in control animals were clearly greater than those induced by experimental manipulations. Furthermore, these changes were reproducible from day to day, following a circadian periodicity. To examine the basis for the rhythmicity in SGLT1 mRNA levels occurring in animals maintained under standard conditions (12-h photoperiod with free access to food and water), we conducted the experiments described below. For rats, both activity and food consumption are greater during the night than the day. Thus, the observed changes in SGLT1 expression are likely in response to the feeding pattern established by the photoperiod and not intrinsic clock signals per se. To follow the abundance of intestinal SGLT1 mRNA over the course of a day, Northern blots were prepared from RNA extracted from jejunal mucosal scrapings of rats killed at 6-h intervals. In a typical experiment (Fig. 1 A), significantly more SGLT1 mRNA was present in the jejunal mucosa of rats killed at 1600 and 2200 h than those killed at the other times. In six sets of animals examined (age range, 7–9 weeks), densitometry indicated that the level at 2200 h was 3.7 ± 0.1 times (p< 0.001) greater than at 0400 h (Fig. 1 C). Sucrase-isomaltase and liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) showed similar circadian variations (Fig. 1 A). In another experiment in which rats were sacrificed at 3-h intervals around the beginning of the dark phase, the peak SGLT1 mRNA level occurred at 1900 h, the time of lights out (not shown). Western blotting revealed that SGLT1 protein levels were higher at both 1600 and 2200 h, consistent with the increased mRNA levels at those times. (Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, the increased transporter activity observed by other investigators (8Fisher R.B. Gardner M.L.G. J. Physiol. 1976; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Stevenson N.R.

Acta. 1975; 406: 131-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) appears to be due to increased SGLT1 protein synthesis from the increased mRNA levels. The intestinal expression as determined by Northern blotting of several other carbohydrate responsive genes, GLUT2,GLUT5, and lactase-phloridzin hydrolase, exhibited similar behavior (not shown). These genes also varied in the ileum, but to a lesser extent. The mRNA levels of glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (not shown), as well as that for α-tubulin (Fig. 1 A), were constant. Also shown is that the mRNA level for c-myc, a marker of cell proliferation, does not change in intestinal mucosal cells over the course of the day (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether the SGLT1 mRNA level also changes in primates, RNA was extracted from duodenal biopsies of rhesus monkeys obtained at either 0900 or 2000 h (taken 2 weeks apart). In the analysis of the monkey shown, the SGLT1 mRNA level was over 5-fold higher in the morning than in the evening (Fig. 1 D). Monkeys express two SGLT1 mRNA species, probably corresponding to the 4.8- and 2.6-kb species found in humans (22Hediger M.A. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5748-5752Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Two additional monkeys exhibited identical behavior (densitometric differences were 5.5-, 4.7-, and 6.1-fold higher in the morning for the three monkeys). Thus, a daily rhythmicity of SGLT1 mRNA levels appears to be a general phenomenon, with its occurrence in the diurnal primate shifted approximately half a day from that found in the nocturnal rat. To assess the involvement of transcription in the SGLT1 mRNA periodicity, nuclei were isolated from rat jejunal mucosal cells for a transcription rate assay. Cells can be sequentially eluted from the intestinal mucosa along the villus-crypt axis by incubating the intestine in buffer containing a chelating agent to remove divalent cations (34Weiser M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 2536-2541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To optimize preservation of transcriptional activity of nuclei during isolation, a low temperature modification employing citrate as the chelator in place of EDTA was used (29Flint N. Cove F.L. Evans G.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In nuclei isolated from combined villus tip enterocytes prepared by this method, SGLT1 transcription was several times higher in nuclei from enterocytes obtained at 1100 versus 1630 h (Fig. 2 A). As expected, the α-tubulin signal was similar at both times. In four experiments, the SGLT1 signal estimated densitometrically (normalized to the α-tubulin signal) was 6.4 ± 1.0 times greater between 1000 and 1100 h than between 1600 and 1700 h (p < 0.007, 2-tailedt test). A GLUT2 signal was not detected at either time examined while that of GLUT5 appeared similar at both times (Fig. 2 A). These data indicate that the SGLT1 transcription rate is not constant, but also exhibits periodicity. In a study in which nuclei were isolated at 6-h intervals, the marked increase in SGLT1 transcription was observed only at 1000 h, but not at the other times examined (Fig. 2 B). A modest signal was also detected for Sucrase and GLUT2 at 1000 h, but not at the other times. The rates of transcription of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and α-tubulin were constant. The temporal change in the SGLT1 transcription rate suggested that the SGLT1promoter contains one or more elements responsible for its periodic activity. To obtain information on the rat SGLT1 promoter, a genomic library was probed with a 5′-terminal BstXI restriction fragment from the rat cDNA (21Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the positive clones contained a 6-kb BamHI fragment that included the first exon and approximately 1 kb of 5′-flanking sequence of the ratSGLT1 gene. A restriction map of the upstream 2.3 kb of this fragment and the sequence of the first 971 nt are shown in Fig. 3. The first exon-intron boundary occurs within the same codon as in humans (35Turk E. Martı́n M.G. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15204-15209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 300 nt upstream of the TATA box show 70% identity to the same region in the human gene (35Turk E. Martı́n M.G. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15204-15209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The putative mRNA start site (by homology to the human sequence) is 30 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. The reported sequence of the rat SGLT1 cDNA clone (21Lee W.-S. Kanai Y. Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12032-12039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained 69 bp upstream of the TATA box (nt 867 in Fig. 3 B). It is not clear whether these additional nucleotides arose from a cryptic upstream start site or were merely part of an aberrant transcript. Analysis of the sequence for transcription factor binding sites (Wisconsin Package, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) using the Tfdsites data base (36Ghosh D. Nuceic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1749-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of potential sites for MLTF/USF (major late transcription factor/upstream stimulatory factor) and HNF-1 (hepatocyte nuclear factor 1) (Fig. 3 B). Of note, the presence of the HNF-1 and the MLTF/USF sites is reminiscent of the carbohydrate response element found in liver-type pyruvate kinase, which in addition to these two sites also contains closely linked sites for NF1 and HNF-4 (37Vaulont S. Puzenat N. Levrat F. Cognet M. Kahn A. Raymondjean M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These latter two sites may be responsible for the largely liver expression of this gene. However, liver type pyruvate kinase is also expressed as a minor pyruvate kinase isoform in the small intestine, but it shows a similar diet responsiveness in both tissues (38Ogier H. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Vaulont S. Reach G. Kahn A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The observed circadian changes in SGLT1 transcription suggest the presence of concomitant circadian changes in the abundance or activity of transcription factor(s). Because the carbohydrate response element in the liver type pyruvate kinase gene is important in its regulation, we reasoned that the analogous region in the SGLT1 gene might account for its circadian periodicity. In preliminary experiments, EMSAs using a 53-bp probe containing both the MLTF/USF and the HNF-1 binding sites (Fig. 3 B; nt 878–930), two different complexes were formed depending on the time intestinal mucosal cells were isolated as sources of nuclear extracts (not shown). Competition assays with a series of overlapping 21-mers indicated that the 3′-terminus (Fig. 3 B; nt 910–930), which included the putative HNF-1 element, contained the element(s) able to form the two different complexes (not shown). Further experiments were performed with the 21-bp probe containing the HNF-1 site, referred to as the HNF probe. When the HNF probe was end-labeled, temporally dependent binding was also observed, a more rapidly migrating AM complex at 1000 h and again at 0400 h and a slower and broader PM complex at 1600 and 2200 h (Fig. 4 A, left). Inclusion of a 500-fold excess of unlabeled competitor reduced the signal obtained for either complex to below detectable levels (Fig. 4 A, right"

Here we report that cAMP-mediated attenuation of the transcription of T helper-1-specific cytokine genes in human medullary thymocytes correlates with the induction of the cAMP-mediated transcriptional repressor ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor). We show that ICER binds specifically to several NFAT/AP-1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells/activating protein-1) composite DNA sites essential for the activation of the interleukin (IL)-2 promoter as well as to a homologous DNA motif present in the proximal segment of the interferon-γ promoter. In the presence of the minimal NFAT DNA-binding domain, which is sufficient for both DNA binding and AP-1 complex formation, ICER and NFAT form NFAT/ICER ternary complexes on several NFAT/AP-1 DNA composite sites previously identified as essential for the expression of the immunoregulatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α. In extracts prepared from human medullary thymocytes treated with forskolin and ionomycin, these composite sites bind endogenously expressed ICER either singly or in complexes. Moreover, in Jurkat cells, ectopically expressed ICER represses transcription from NFAT-mediated, phorbol ester/ionophore-activated IL-2, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor-α promoters. We present evidence that ICER interactions with NFAT/AP-1 composite DNA sites correlate with its ability to repress transcription.

These findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved in cAMP-mediated transcriptional attenuation of cytokine expression. It is well established that cAMP signaling is inhibitory to T cell proliferation and effector functions. In particular, cAMP inhibits the expression of T helper-1 cytokine genes (1Munoz E. Zubiaga A.M. Merrow M. Sauter N.P. Huber B.T. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 2Novak T.J. Rothenberg E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Earlier reported studies of fibroblasts showed that elevated levels of intracellular cAMP inhibit upstream signal transduction pathways involved in cell growth and differentiation (4Burgering B.M.

Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). In contrast to fibroblasts, in which elevated levels of intracellular cAMP inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases involved in the signal transduction of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, T cell extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 are insensitive to elevated levels of intracellular cAMP (6Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18094-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Moreover, the cAMP-mediated inhibition of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in T cells shows delayed kinetics, an observation that correlates with the induction of the cAMP-inducible early repressor ICER 1The abbreviations used are: ICER, inducible cAMP early repressor; AP-1, activating protein 1; bZIP, basic region/leucine zipper; CRE, cAMP-response element; CREB, CRE-binding protein; CREM, CRE modulator protein; GM-CSF, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor; IFNγ, interferon-γ; IL, interleukin, NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T cells; NFAT DBD; DNA binding domain of NFAT; PMA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; CD28RE, CD28-responsive element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.

In addition, overexpression of NFAT achieved by transfection of NFAT-encoding cDNAs to lymphoma cells abrogates the sensitivity of cAMP-mediated inhibition of IL-2 gene expression (8Tsuruta L.

Koyano-Nakagawa N. Arai N. Arai K. Yokota T. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5255-5264PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, phosphorylation of amino-terminal serines of NFAT by protein kinase A does not prevent calcineurin-mediated translocation of NFAT to the nucleus, despite its ability to prevent IL-2 gene expression (10Beals C.R. Sheridan C.M. Turck C.W. Gardner P. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1930-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 11Masuda E.S. Liu J. Imamura R. Imai S.-I. Arai K.-I. Arao N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The notion that a newly synthesized transcriptional repressor rather than inhibition of upstream signal transduction pathways could be involved in the cAMP-mediated transcriptional attenuation of T helper-1 cytokine expression was further strengthened by the reported alleviation of cAMP-mediated inhibition of IL-2 expression in the presence of inhibitors of both RNA and protein synthesis (6Hsueh Y.-P. Lai M.-Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18094-18098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). ICER is a transcriptional repressor that appears to serve as a generalized negative regulator of the CREB and CREM families of transcription factors as well as other related bZIP family members (12Hoeffler J.P. Meyer T.E. Yun Y. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1430-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 13Meyer T.E. Habener J.F. Endocr.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 7: 133-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ICER isoforms represent a unique cAMP-inducible CREM subfamily of transcription factors containing cAMP-response elements within an internal P2 promoter. Because of autoregulation of the cAMP-inducible P2 promoter, the expression of ICER can be intrinsically rhythmical. The rhythmical expression of ICER was first described in the pineal gland and in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (16Stehle J.H. Foulkes N.S. Molina C.A. Simmoneaux V. Pevet P. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1993; 365: 314-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar,17Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). However, the P2 promoter of ICER is also inducible in organs other than the pineal and hypothalamic-pituitary gonadal axis such as in specific subsets of T lymphocytes including human medullary thymocytes (7Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the Jurkat T cell line ectopically expressed ICER can substitute for the inhibitory effects of cAMP on the transcriptional attenuation of IL-2 promoter activity (7Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The NFAT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) and AP-1 (activating protein 1) represent two major transcription factor families implicated in the transcription of the IL-2 promoter in proliferating T lymphocytes (18Nolan G.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 795-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 20Crabtree G.R. Clipstone N.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 1045-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). To address the possible mechanism by which ICER down-regulates IL-2 gene expression, we examined the binding of bacterially expressed ICER to all five NFAT motifs of the IL-2 promoter reported to be essential for the full induction of the IL-2 gene (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) either alone or in the presence of the minimal DNA-binding domain of NFAT (NFAT DBD). The highest affinity of ICER binding was found on a CD28-responsive element (CD28RE; −160 NFAT/AP-1 composite site) and −90 site, which is the motif in the IL-2 promoter that has striking sequence homology with the conserved proximal region (base pairs −73 to −48) of both the human and mouse promoters of the IFNγ genes (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 22Penix L.A. Sweetser M.T. Weaver W.M. Hoeffler J.P. Kerppola T.K. Wilson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31964-31972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, certain NFAT/AP-1 composite sites that reside within the IL-4, GM-CSF, and TNF-α promoters resemble those located within the IL-2 promoter (23Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6397-6405PubMed Google Scholar, 24Cockerill P.N. Shannon M.F. Bert A.G. Ryan G.R. Vadas M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It is believed that the mechanism underlying the actions of NFAT requires the binding of NFAT and/or NFAT/AP-1 to the NFAT/AP-1 composite binding motifs as ternary complexes (18Nolan G.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 795-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These complexes are believed to be essential for the transcriptional expression of immunoregulatory cytokines during T cell proliferation, such as IL-2, IL-4, GM-CSF, and TNF-α (19Rao A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 274-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ICER binds to these NFAT/AP-1 composite DNA sites in vitro, either directly or indirectly via complex formation with the rel homology region of NFAT (NFAT DBD). Furthermore, we detect the induction of ICER-immunoreactive complexes in extracts prepared from human medullary thymocytes treated with forskolin and ionomycin. Ectopically expressed ICER represses transcription from the IL-2, GM-CSF, and TNF-α promoters activated by ionomycin and phorbol ester, suggesting that the induction of ICER in response to cAMP may be responsible for the observed cAMP-mediated transcriptional attenuation of T helper-1 cytokine responses. Human thymus glands were obtained from children (ages 3 months to 4 years) undergoing corrective cardiac surgery. Thymocytes were fractionated over discontinuous Percoll gradients (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (28Pereira P. Larsson E.L. Forni L. Bandeira A. Coutinho A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7691-7695Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells with densities of 1.060 < o < 1.070 and p > 1.070 were collected and classified into large (significantly enriched for medullary thymocytes) and small (cortical) thymocytes according to an established protocol (7Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Separated human thymocytes were maintained in short term cultures in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin, and treated as indicated. RNA extraction was performed as described (Qiagen). RNA probes hCK1 and hCK3 were purchased from Pharmingen and labeled with [α-32P]CTP using reagents from an RNA probe kit (Ambion). These probes were used for RNase protection studies according to the protocol provided by Ambion (RPAII ribonuclease protection assay kit). Separation of whole cell proteins (50 μg) was carried out by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) for 2 h at 40 mA in Tris/glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS) at room temperature. The proteins were electrotransferred (0.4 A) overnight at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris/glycine buffer with 12% methanol on Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) for 1 h with gentle agitation at room temperature. For immunological detection, the same solution without dry milk but containing the ICER or CREM-specific antiserum (CS4) diluted 1:10,000 was agitated for 1 h, followed by three washes, with subsequent incubation with horseradish peroxidase conjugated to a secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:5000 for 1 h, followed by nine washes, and finally developed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human ICER II cDNA was subcloned into the pGEXKG vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and expressed in bacteria as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The pGSTagCREB construct was described previously (29Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). Purifications of both ICER and CREB were carried out with minor modifications according to the protocol previously established for CREB (29Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). NFATpXS-(1–187), encompassing the minimal DNA-biding domain of NFATp (gift from Dr. A. Rao), was expressed in bacteria as a hexahistidine-tagged protein and purified as reported previously (30Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol.

Whole cell extracts were prepared by high salt extraction using 50 mmHepes, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as described previously (30Jain J.

Binding reactions were performed in a 15-μl reaction volume containing 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC) as an unspecific competitor and recombinant proteins or whole cells extracts as indicated. 32P-Labeled oligonucleotides and, where indicated, unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides in excess were added and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were run on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE at 200 V for 2 h following a 2-h prerun at 4 °C. The dried gels were exposed for autoradiography overnight.

Lowercase letters indicate overhangs forSpeI/XbaI recognition sites (IL-2) orBamHI/BglII recognition sites (GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-α). As competitors, the following oligonucleotides were used: nf (mouse IL-4 NFAT, positions −69 to −79), 5′-ATAAAATTTTCCAATGTAAA-3′; ap (human metallothionein IIA AP-1 site, positions −114 to −88), 5′-GAGCCGCAAGTG ACTCAGCGCGGGGCG-3′; and cre (mouse c-fosgene oligonucleotide, surrounding CRE site in position −60) 5′-gatccCAGTTCCGCCCAGTGACGTAGGAAGTCCATCa-3′.

GST-ICER (GST-CREB) Sepharose beads prepared as described above were diluted 1:10 in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na3 (PO4)2, 10 mm NaF, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm leupeptin, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, and recombinant protein(s) were added to a final volume of 250 μl and incubated at 4 °C on a nutator for 1.5 h. The beads were then washed three times with the same buffer, resuspended directly in Laemmli buffer, and loaded on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Retained NFAT DBD protein was visualized by Western blotting described below using R59 anti-NFAT DBD antiserum. Transfection assays were performed by the DEAE-dextran technique. Typically, 107 Jurkat cells were transfected with 2 μg of the reporter and the same amount of ICER expression vector and treated 18 h posttransfection with phorbol ester (10−5 mg/ml) and ionomycin (1 μg/ml) for 48 h. Luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays and quantification methods are described elsewhere (Promega; Ref. 33Phillippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4877-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The percentage of conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Under the experimental conditions used, human medullary thymocytes exhibited the characteristics of naive T helper-0 and T helper-1 cells with predominant IL-2 and IFNγ expression documented by RNase protection used for the evaluation of mRNA levels of multiple cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-14, IL-15, interferon-β, IFNγ, human migration inhibitory factor, TNF-α, TNF-β, Ltβ, and transforming growth factors β1, β2, and β3) (Fig. 1). Stimulation of medullary thymocytes with a combination of phorbol ester and ionomycin significantly induced the synthesis of mRNAs encoding IL-2, IFNγ and to a lesser extent also TNF-α and Ltβ (Fig. 1 A, lane 4; Fig. 1 B, lane 4). At the same time, cotreatment with forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP reduced the cellular mRNA levels of IL-2, IFNγ, TNF-α, and Ltβ (Fig. 1 A, lanes 5 and 6; Fig. 1 B, lanes 5 and 6). We propose that at least part of this transcriptional attenuation is based on cAMP-mediated expression of the transcriptional repressor ICER and a subsequent blockade of NFAT/AP-1 composite DNA sites essential for T helper-1 cytokine expression. The inhibition by ICER may occur either directly through binding to the DNA element or indirectly via protein-protein interactions such as to the rel homology domain of NFAT (NFAT DBD). To test the proposed mechanism involved, we first sought evidence for the presence of ICER protein in human medullary thymocytes after forskolin treatment to explore whether ICER may interact with important NFAT/AP-1 enhancer motifs of the IL-2 and IFNγ promoters. Western immunoblotting analysis using an ICER-specific antiserum (7Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) confirmed that ICER protein is indeed detectable in human medullary thymocytes but is absent in cortical thymocytes after 3 h of forskolin treatment (Fig. 1 C). This finding is in agreement with the previously observed delayed appearance of ICER mRNA in medullary thymocytes after their exposure to forskolin and its subsequent deinduction (7Bodor J. Spetz A.-L. Strominger J.L. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3536-3541Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the cAMP-mediated inhibition of cytokine expression may occur in a stage-specific manner in cells of T cell lineage. To further address the possible mechanism by which ICER down-regulates IL-2 gene expression, we examined the binding of bacterially expressed ICER to all five NFAT motifs of the IL-2 promoter reported to be essential for the full induction of the IL-2 gene (21Penix L. Weaver W.M. Pang Y. Young H.A. Wilson C.B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1483-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). Four out of five NFAT sites in positions −90, −135, −160, and −280 were previously characterized as NFAT/AP-1 composite sites due to their inherent ability to bind to the NFAT/AP-1 complex in a cooperative fashion (34Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The fifth NFAT site in the most proximal position, NFAT −45, does not bind to the NFAT/AP-1 complex and was determined to be exclusively an NFAT binding site (34Rooney J.W. Sun Y.L. Glimcher L.H. Hoey T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6299-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed ICER, as well as ICER expressed in COS cells (data not shown), binds to all five NFAT sites, although to different extents (Fig. 2 B). The strongest binding was observed to the NFAT/AP-1 composite sites in positions −90 and −160, an intermediate binding to the −135 NFAT/AP-1 composite site, and weak binding to the most proximal and distal NFAT and NFAT/AP-1 sites in positions −45 and −280, respectively. The binding specificity of recombinant ICER was evaluated using a CREM-specific antiserum (CS4) that “supershifts” ICER bound to specific oligonucleotides containing individually the five DNA motifs, leaving nonspecific binding unaffected (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–10) as well as by using control oligonucleotide encompassing the first 21-base pair repeat (H21) of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I long terminal repeat promoter containing the CRE-like motif (35Bodor J. Walker W. Flemington E. Spetz A.L. Habener J.F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B, lanes 11 and 12). To better understand the role of the interactions of ICER with NFAT/AP-1 composite DNA motifs, we examined the effectiveness of ICER binding to the DNA motifs in the presence of NFAT DBD. This domain of NFAT, which has the highest degree of conservation among NFAT family members (36Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), is both necessary and sufficient for DNA binding as well as to associate AP-1 with NFAT (30Jain J. Burgeon E. Badalian T.M. Hogan P.G. Rao A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4138-4145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). All NFAT motifs on the IL-2 promoter examined, with the exception of the NFAT/AP-1 composite site in position −90, bound NFAT efficiently (Fig. 2 C). The most pronounced ability of NFAT to associate with ICER was observed on the sites with the highest DNA binding efficiencies to both proteins, particularly at site position −160 (CD28RE), and to a lesser extent to the NFAT site in position −45. Interestingly, this NFAT −45 site tends to show a stronger binding of ICER to NFAT in the NFAT/ICER complex compared with ICER by itself (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3). Because the NFAT −45 of the IL-2 promoter is the only one of the five sites examined without an adjacent AP-1 site, the finding that this site can form an NFAT/ICER complex suggests that ICER itself may tether to NFAT by a protein-protein interaction in addition to a protein-DNA action. To examine whether or not ICER and NFAT may directly interact in the absence of DNA, GST pull-down assays were performed using a GST-ICER fusion protein linked to a Sepharose matrix in the presence of a truncated NFAT consisting of the NFAT DBD (Fig. 3, lane 1). GST-ICER formed a complex with NFAT DBD as demonstrated by retention of NFAT DBD. Interestingly, GST-CREB failed to associate with NFAT DBD under the same conditions (Fig. 3, lane 10). To examine the specificity of both components in the NFAT/ICER ternary complex found on the CD28RE (−160 motif) of the IL-2 promoter, we used both CREM-specific antiserum (CS4) and antiserum raised against the minimal DNA-binding domain of NFAT (R59). Both antisera either prevented or reduced the amount of the NFAT/ICER complex (Fig. 2 D,lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides containing NFAT (nf oligonucleotide spanning mouse IL-4 NFAT, positions −69 to −79) or the AP-1 motif (ap oligonucleotide spanning the human metallothionein IIA AP-1 site, positions −114 to −88) eliminated the NFAT/ICER complex (Fig. 2 D, lanes 6 and 7, respectively), suggesting that both ICER and NFAT are essential components of the observed complex. Analogous experiments performed with the NFAT DBD and truncated forms of Fos and Jun confirmed in vitro that both NFAT/AP-1 and NFAT/ICER complexes could exist in the context of the CD28RE (−160 NFAT/AP-1 composite site; Fig. 2 D, lanes 8–14). Interestingly, in the presence of NFAT DBD, the majority of ICER protein was retained in the complex with NFAT DBD, although NFAT/ICER and NFAT/AP-1 complexes appear to show unequal binding affinities to different NFAT/AP-1 motifs. For example, the −280 motif of the IL-2 promoter, known from NFAT studies as the principal site for binding of the NFAT/AP-1 complex, binds NFAT/AP-1 complexes effectively (32Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 37Jain J. Valge-Archer V.E. Rao A. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1240-1250PubMed Google Scholar), showing little or no detectable formation of an NFAT/ICER complex (Fig. 2 C, lanes 13–15). In contrast, the CD28RE (−160 NFAT/AP-1 composite site) of human IL-2 promoter creates a ternary NFAT/ICER complex with an equal or slightly higher efficiency than the NFAT/AP-1 complex (Fig. 2 D). Unlike the CD28RE (−160 motif), which shows equally high affinity for both ICER and NFAT, the NFAT/AP-1 motif of the IL-2 promoter in position −90, which has striking homology to the conserved proximal element of the INFγ promoter, does not interact with NFAT DBD (Fig. 4). Studies performed on the conserved proximal motifs of both human and mouse IFNγ promoters demonstrated high affinity ICER binding and a lack of NFAT binding or NFAT/ICER complex formation in the presence of NFAT/DBD (Fig. 4), a situation similar to that observed on the homologous −90 motif of the IL-2 promoter (Fig. 2). NFAT/AP-1 binding sites have been shown previously to be essential for the efficient activation of the GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-α promoters. Therefore, we examined the binding to these sites of ICER and NFAT, both as purified recombinant proteins and in extracts prepared from human medullary thymocytes treated with forskolin and ionomycin (Fig. 5). These studies demonstrated that ICER can bind either by itself or in complexes with NFAT DBD to these composite sites in the promoters of the GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNF-α promoters, similar to the experiments using the binding site motifs of the IL-2 and IFNγ promoters. The GM-420 DNA motif s"
https://openalex.org/W2046031514,"Protein sequence analysis of the cloned sialyltransferase gene family has revealed the presence of two conserved protein motifs in the middle of the lumenal catalytic domain, termed L-sialylmotif and S-sialylmotif. In our previous study (Datta, A. K., and Paulson, J. C. (1995) J. Biol. Chem.270, 1497–1500) the larger L-sialylmotif of ST6Gal I was analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis, which provided evidence that it participates in the binding of the CMP-NeuAc, a common donor substrate for all the sialyltransferases. However, none of the mutants tested in this motif had any significant effect on their binding affinities toward the acceptor substrate asialo α1-acid glycoprotein. In this study, we have investigated the role of the S-sialylmotif of the same enzyme ST6Gal I. In total, nine mutants have been constructed by changing the conserved amino acids of this motif to mostly alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Kinetic analysis for the mutants which retained sialyltransferase activity showed that the mutations in the S-sialylmotif caused a change ofKm values for both the donor and the acceptor substrates. Our results indicated that this motif participates in the binding of both the substrates. A sequence homology search also supported this finding, which showed that the downstream amino acid sequence of the S-sialylmotif is conserved for each subgroup of this enzyme family, indicating its association with the acceptor substrate.

The transfer of sialic acid from its nucleotide donor CMP-Sia 1The abbreviations used are: CMP-Sia, CMP-sialic acid; ASGP, asialo α1-acid glycoprotein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CMP-NeuAc, CMP-neuraminic acid; nt, nucleotide(s). to the nonreducing terminus of oligosaccharyl structures of various glycoproteins and glycolipids is mediated by sialyltransferases, a group of about 15 enzymes belonging to the family of glycosyltransferases (1Paulson J.C. Colley J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17615-17618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the first three sialyltransferases, namely ST6Gal I (see Ref. 2Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar for nomenclature), ST3Gal I (3Gillespie W. Kelm S. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21004-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ST3Gal III (4Wen D.X. Livingston B.D. Medzihradszky K.F. Kelm S. Burlingame A.L. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21011-21019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and analysis of their protein sequences deduced from the respective cDNAs revealed that all of these gene products have the type II membrane protein topology common among all the members of the glycosyltransferases examined to date. This topology is characterized by the presence of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, an uncleavable hydrophobic signal-anchor sequence that serves as the membrane-spanning domain, a proteolytically sensitive “stem” region, and a large catalytic domain that projects into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. In contrast to other glycosyltransferases, however, the sequences derived from the sialyltransferase gene family revealed the presence of two conserved protein motifs in the lumenal catalytic domain, termed as L- and S-sialylmotifs, consisting of about 48 and 23 amino acids, respectively (5Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11504-11507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 7Kurosawa N. Kojima N. Inoue M. Hamamoto T. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19048-19053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This unique feature was exploited to clone new genes of this family by a PCR-based strategy using degenerated primers designed based on the invariant amino acids present at either end of these two motifs. This strategy was highly successful in cloning nine additional sialyltransferases (5Livingston B.D. Paulson J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29366-29371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The cloning of these new genes by PCR confirmed that the presence of sialylmotifs in any new gene is, in fact, the “cardinal” feature of the sialyltransferase gene family. By now, in total 13 genes have been cloned (2Tsuji S. Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: v-viiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of their protein sequences revealed that each of these enzymes shares this common structural feature: the presence of L-sialylmotif and S-sialylmotif. Comparison among the members showed that the larger L-sialylmotif consisting of 48–49 amino acids in the center of each molecule exhibits >70% identity among homologous groups, 40–60% among heterologous groups, and has eight invariant amino acids including one invariant cysteine. The S-sialylmotif, on the other hand, has two invariant amino acids in a stretch of 23 residues. Interestingly, one of these is also cysteine. These two cysteines are predicted to be involved in disulfide linkage formation (6Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 2-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Such a unique feature of the presence of these two sialylmotifs in all the cloned sialyltransferases suggests that these motifs might contribute to a structural feature related to the common function of these enzymes. For example, each enzyme transfers sialic acid from the common donor substrate, CMP-NeuAc, to an oligosaccharide acceptor substrate. Thus, these motifs could form part of the binding sites for either the donor or acceptor substrates, or both. Nevertheless, their role in the formation of a specific conformation required for its enzymatic activity may not be ruled out. Previously, we examined the role of the L-sialylmotif using site-specific mutants of the enzyme ST6Gal I (EC 2.4.99.1) as a model. This enzyme, which forms the Neu5Acα2,6Galβ1, 4GlcNAc sequence common to many Asn-linked oligosaccharides, was cloned from rat liver (15Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that the alanine mutation of some of the invariant amino acids in the L-sialylmotif of this enzyme resulted in an increased Km toward the donor substrate CMP-NeuAc without significant effect on the acceptor binding affinity, suggesting that this motif contributes to the binding of the common donor substrate (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 34: 157-165Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the role of the S-sialylmotif of the same enzyme ST6Gal I and show that the single point mutation of its conserved amino acids affected the Km values of the mutant enzymes for both the donor and acceptor substrates. The single point mutants were constructed following the megaprimer method described earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the ST6Gal I (GenBank accession no. M18769), previously subcloned in pBluescript KS+ plasmid (19Lee E.U. Roth J. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13848-13855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template. The nomenclature for the mutant sialyltransferases has been assigned the number that reflects the amino acid residue number for which alanine has been substituted; e.g. for P318A, proline 318 is replaced by alanine. The mutagenic antisense oligonucleotides (the substituted nucleotides are underlined) used for construction of the corresponding cDNAs were as follows (5′-3′): P318A, GCCGGAGGATGCGGGATTTGGCTGA (nt 969–939); S319A, CCAGCATGCCGGAGGCTGGGGGATT (nt 970–946); S320A, CCAGCATGCCGGCGGATGGGGGATT (nt 970–946); G321A, GATACCCAGCATGGCGGAGGATGG (nt 975–952); C332A, CCTGGTCAGCCAGCGTCATC (nt 984–1003); V335A, CGTAAATATCTGCCTGGTCACAC (nt 1015–993); V335L, CGTAAATATCTAGCTGGTCACAC (nt 1015–993); E339A, GGGAGGAACGCGTAAATATCTA (nt 1025–1004); F340A, GGATGGGAGGGCCTCGTAAATA (nt 1029–1008). As described earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 18Datta A.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4530-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), in the first step of PCR, the 5′-end oligonucleotide primer, GCTCTAGAATTCCAATCCTCAGTTACCACAG (5′-3′, nt 214–236), and the mutant antisense oligonucleotide (25–50 pmol each) were used to introduce the desired mutation using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene); the conditions used were: 94 °C, 30 s; 56 °C, 1 min; 73 °C, 2 min for 20 cycles. The gel analysis showed the generation of a single band for about 780 base pairs depending on the position of the oligomer. This double-stranded DNA product from each reaction was purified using Geneclean II (Bio101, San Diego, CA) and used as a megaprimer in the second step of PCR. Our earlier results showed that the yield of the final desired product is improved by 5 cycles of linear amplification using only one primer, the megaprimer. The reaction mixture for the linear amplification contained 10 ng of template, 80 μm dNTPs in the 1 × Pfu DNA polymerase buffer and ∼50 ng of megaprimer (estimated from the agarose gel) and started with the addition of 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase following these conditions: 94 °C, 1 min; 73 °C, 3 min for 5 cycles. The 3′-end antisense oligonucleotide primer, CCAGGAGAGGATCCATAAAATGAC (5′-3′, nt 1270–1247), was then added, and the reaction was continued as follows: 94 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 1 min; 73 °C, 3 min for 20 cycles. The products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, which showed the generation of a major single band of 1.05 kilobases for the specific product. This band was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Geneclean to separate from the megaprimer. The gel-purified product for the mutants was digested with BstBI (at nt 824) and BspE1 (at nt 1194). The 370-base pair fragment containing the mutation was purified for each mutant and subcloned into a similarly digested and purified larger fragment of spST-2 (20Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) following a standard procedure (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was used to transform competent cells of Escherichia coli. The colonies were isolated, and the plasmids were obtained using Promega's plasmid miniprep kit (Promega). The mutation was confirmed by dideoxy double-stranded sequencing (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) of the entire fragment that has been subcloned, including the restriction sites used. For the analysis, the wild-type ST6Gal I and its mutants were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells as described earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells (1–2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish) were transfected using 2.0 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the supplier (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of transfected proteins was typically allowed to continue for 36–48 h post-transfection before harvesting the cells. The culture medium was then collected and concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration using micro-concentrators (MWCO 10; Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrated medium containing the soluble-expressed sialyltransferase was used directly for analysis of the enzymatic activity as described earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). These transfected cells were also used for radiolabeling of the expressed proteins. Transfection was repeated at least three times for each mutant with plasmid DNAs from different preparations. Metabolic labeling of cells using Trans 35S-Express protein label (NEN Life Science Products; 100 μCi/ml) was carried out essentially as described elsewhere (23Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Adler B. Browne J.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17619-17622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled medium from the transfected COS-1 cells was used for immunoprecipitation as follows: the radiolabeled medium (500 μl) was incubated with 10 μl of pre-immune rabbit serum for 20 min at room temperature. 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated with rotation at room temperature for 30 min. These were centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected. 10 μl of affinity-purified rabbit anti-rat ST6Gal I was added and incubated at 4 °C for overnight. 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The precipitated immune complex obtained by centrifugation was washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% SDS. Proteins were eluted from the pellet by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli gel sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The gel was then soaked for fixing once in 10% acetic acid, 30% ethanol for 40 min and then in Enlightning rapid autoradiography enhancer as instructed by the supplier (NEN Life Science Products) before exposed to Kodak Biomax-MR film at −80 °C. The Western blot, protein determination, sialyltransferase assay, and the enzyme assay for kinetic analysis were done as described earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For expression of the wild-type ST6Gal I and its mutants, the mammalian expression vector construct used was based on pSVL (Pharmacia), which contained the soluble form of the cDNA for rat ST6Gal I as mentioned earlier (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The mutants were derived from this expression vector of the wild-type enzyme spST-2, in which the N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, signal anchor domain, and the stem regions (first 71 amino acids) were replaced with a cleavable signal peptide of dog pancreas insulin (20Colley K.J. Lee E.U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7784-7793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, when the cDNAs for the wild-type ST6Gal I enzyme and its mutants were transfected into COS-1 cells, the proteins were expressed as a soluble form and were detected in the culture medium. For this experiment, we designed the single point mutants, changing the corresponding amino acids to alanine. A total of eight such mutants for the S-sialylmotif were constructed (Fig. 1). In addition, we also constructed mutant V335L by replacing Val335 with Leu. For rapid evaluation of the effect of mutation of the conserved amino acids, we used COS-1 because of its low endogenous sialyltransferase activity. Medium from COS-1 cells mock-transfected using only the vector (pSVL) showed typically less than 2% activity compared with that of expressed soluble sialyltransferases. Freshly grown COS-1 cells were transfected with the cDNAs for both wild-type ST6Gal I and its mutants. The expression of the desired sialyltransferase proteins were checked by immunoprecipitation of the metabolically labeled proteins. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-radiolabeled proteins using the anti-ST6Gal I sialyltransferase antibody, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicated that all mutant sialyltransferases were expressed and exhibited similar molecular weight to the wild-type sialyltransferase (Fig. 2). Their similar migration in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that there may not be a gross rearrangement in their native structure because of the introduced point mutation. To determine the enzymatic properties of the mutant sialyltransferases, media from the transfected cells were concentrated (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and used as a source of crude enzyme. By Western blot, we estimated the relative amount of proteins that is used for sialyltransferase activity. By comparative analysis, it was noted that, although the expression levels were apparently similar to that of the wild-type enzyme for S320A, G321A, V335A, V335L, E339A, and F340A, the enzyme activities obtained were 41, 75, 83, 79, 35, and 15%, respectively. On the other hand, although the protein expression for S319A and C332A seemed to be within 2–5-fold, the sialyltransferase activity measured was less than 5%. For P318A, the expression achieved was, however, very low, if any. Repeated experiments of transfection for the expression of P318A failed to achieve detectable expression levels for this mutant protein. This proline is conserved in most of the sialyltransferases cloned. Proline is known to confer unique conformational constraints on the peptide chain of many biologically important proteins. This conformational restriction seems to be important for the biological functions of these proteins, as has been evidenced by a site-directed mutagenesis study (for a review, see Ref. 25Vanhoop G. Goossens F. De Meester I. Hendriks D. Scharpe S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). It is possible that the alanine mutation of this Pro318 induces some conformational change of ST6Gal I that affected its expression. The mutants, which retained ST6Gal I sialyltransferase activity, were used for the comparative kinetic analysis. Analysis of the kinetics of the wild-type and each mutant sialyltransferase expressed in COS-1 cells was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” except for F340A, which had low activity and was not evaluated. TheKm values for each sialyltransferase were determined for the donor substrate, CMP-NeuAc, and the best glycoprotein acceptor substrate of the wild-type enzyme, asialo α1-acid glycoprotein (ASGP). This glycoprotein acceptor contains fiveN-linked oligosaccharides that are predominately bi- and tetra-antennary structures, each branch of which is terminated with the acceptor sequence Galβ1,4GlcNAc (26Yoshima H. Matsumoto A. Mizuochi T. Kawasaki T. Kobata A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8476-8484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data obtained for each of the enzymes produced Lineweaver-Burke plots with correlation coefficients of 0.95 or greater (e.g. Fig. 3). Table I summarizes the Km values obtained for both the substrates. This shows that the Km values for the donor substrate CMP-NeuAc were significantly altered, particularly for S320A and E339A with increases in Km (apparent) of about 6-fold. TheKm values for asialo α1-acid glycoprotein were also altered by about 2-fold for these two mutants. Interestingly, Val335 to Ala showed increased binding affinity toward the acceptor substrate (about 5-fold decreasedKm), which remained unchanged when mutated to Leu. Thus, the interaction of the enzyme with the acceptor substrate is more favored when Ala was introduced. The mutation of Gly321 to Ala, on the other hand, increased the Km values by about 3-fold for both the donor and the acceptor substrates. It is possible that this invariant amino acid is essential for the hydrogen bond formation through the interaction with the OH group of both the donor and the acceptor substrates. Therefore, even a conserved mutation of Gly to Ala affected the binding affinities for both the substrates.Table IKinetic constants for the wild-type ST6Gal I and its S-sialylmotif mutantsST6Gal I constructsApparent Km values1-aThe apparent Km values listed was the average of three experiments.

Open table in a new tab Cytidine analog CDP is known to be a potent inhibitor of sialyltransferases, exhibiting equilibrium dissociation constants similar to that of CMP-NeuAc (27Paulson J.C. Beranek W.E. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2356-2362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier, it was shown that the mutants of the L-sialylmotif, which had increased Km values toward the CMP-NeuAc, also had increased Ki for CDP compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, as expected (16Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To determine if this is also true for the mutants of S-sialylmotif, CDP was tested as a competitive inhibitor of CMP-NeuAc for mutant S320A as a representative (Fig. 4). The Ki for S320A was determined to be 50 μm, representing about a 10-fold increase over the wild-type enzyme (4.7 μm). This increase in Ki for CDP is comparable in magnitude with the increase in Km (which is about 6-fold) for CMP-NeuAc, suggesting that Ser320 participates in the binding of the common cytidine moiety in these two ligands. A protein sequence homology search among the cloned sialyltransferases showed that the downstream amino acid sequence of the S-sialylmotif is conserved for each subgroup of this enzyme family. For example, the sequence LYGFWPF is present in the members of the ST8Sia subfamily only. Similarly, conserved sequence could be identified for the members of the other subfamilies. This finding suggests that such a conserved sequence may confer the linkage specificity for the sialic acid transferred to the glycosyl moiety of the acceptor substrate. The family of glycosyltransferase enzymes transfers respective sugars from its activated nucleotide-sugar donor to various glycolipids and glycoproteins. By now, a considerable number of clones have been obtained for different members of this glycosyltransferase family (see Ref. 29Field M.C. Wainwright L.J. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar for a review) that include sialyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, and galactosyltransferases. Analysis of the deduced protein sequence indicated that all of these members have common structural features: the presence of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic protein domain, which is not essential for the catalytic activity, followed by about a 20-amino acid transmembrane domain that determines the retention signal sequence for these Golgi lumenal enzymes. Apart from the stem region, the rest of the protein that resides in the lumen confers the catalytic activity. There is evidence to support such a model. For example, ST6Gal I sialyltransferase, the subject of this study, transfers sialic acid from CMP-NeuAc to the Galβ1,4GlcNAc sequence common to many Asn-linked oligosaccharides (30Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13835-13844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Weinstein J. de Souza-e-Silva U. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13845-13853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of its protein sequence deduced from the cDNA cloned from rat liver (15Weinstein J. Lee E.U. McEntee K. Lai P.H. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17735-17743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the primary structure of this enzyme consists of a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1–9), a membrane anchor and signal sequence (amino acids 10–27), a stem region (amino acids 28–62), and a large lumenal catalytic domain (amino acids 63–403). This enzyme is found to be active even after truncation of 71 amino acids from its N-terminal that defines the cytosolic, transmembrane, and stem regions. Similarly, Macher and his colleagues (32Xu Z. Vo L. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have obtained evidence that 20% of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of two human α1,3/4 fucosyltransferases (FucT III and V) is not required for enzyme activity, whereas truncation of the C terminus of these enzymes results in their inactivation. Although these studies showed that the lumenal C-terminal part of these enzymes confers the catalytic activity, nothing has been known about the substrate binding sites until recently. Studies have been initiated by different groups to define the substrate binding sites of various members of this glycosyltransferase family using different techniques, including chemical and site-directed mutagenesis (32Xu Z.

This enzyme family has a unique structural feature that is not present in other members of the glycosyltransferases. Each of these enzymes shares the presence of two conserved protein domains termed sialylmotifs (see Ref. 17Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 34: 157-165Google Scholar). Because of this conserved nature, we have studied these sialylmotifs for their possible role in the catalytic activity of these enzymes using ST6Gal I as a model. Mutants have been constructed for"

However, the mechanism of extracellular matrix signaling is poorly defined. In mammary gland, the expression of milk protein genes is controlled by cross-talk between signals derived from the basement membrane protein, laminin, and the lactogenic hormone, prolactin. Signals from basement membrane are transduced by β1integrins and are required for prolactin to activate DNA binding of the milk protein gene transcription factor, Stat5. Here we show that basement membrane is necessary for tyrosine phosphorylation of the prolactin receptor and thus directly affects cytokine signaling and differentiation at the level of the plasma membrane. Prolactin does not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of its receptor, Jak2, or Stat5 in nondifferentiated breast epithelia cultured on collagen I, and we show that this is due to a vanadate-sensitive activity that inhibits the prolactin pathway. We suggest that protein-tyrosine phosphatases are novel targets for regulation by extracellular matrix and in mammary cells represent an additional control to the requirement of integrins for milk protein production.

Cell behavior is controlled by a network of signals derived from growth and differentiation factors as well as from the local cellular environment. These signals are interpreted by appropriate receptors and converted into intracellular pathways that modulate transcriptional or post-transcriptional events. Migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation are strongly influenced by cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BM, basement membrane; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; PrlR, prolactin receptor; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; BM, basement membrane; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; PrlR, prolactin receptor; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase.(1Giancotti G.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 691-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). For example, integrins determine the activity of both Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase mediated growth factor responses, and cell-ECM interactions contribute to cyclin activation thereby regulating cell cycle entry (2Assoian R.K.

Many signal transduction pathways, including those conveyed by ECM-integrin interactions are controlled by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (7Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Homeostasis of signaling requires negative regulation through protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (8Neel B.G. Tonks N.K.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and these enzymes are therefore of potential significance in the control of ECM signaling. In the breast, epithelial cell interactions with basement membrane (BM) control the prolactin-dependent expression of milk protein genes (10Streuli C.H. Ekblom P. Timpl R. The Laminins.

The molecular details of the prolactin signaling pathway were first described in the rat lymphoma cell line, Nb2, which requires prolactin for proliferation. Ligation of the prolactin receptor (PrlR) results in induction of the associated PTK activity, Jak2 (14Campbell G.S. Argetsinger L.S. Ihle J.N. Kelly P.A. Rillema J.A. Cartersu C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This leads to activation of Stat transcription factors that recognize specific DNA sequence motifs in the promoters of early response genes implicated in proliferation (17David M. Petricoin E.F.

Prolactin triggers differentiation through a similar pathway, and in cells transfected with PrlR, Stat5, and β-casein reporter vectors, prolactin induces transcription from the β-casein promoter via activation of endogenous Jak2 and ectopically expressed Stat5 (19Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Mammary epithelial cells are adherent and, in contrast to Nb2 cells which grow in suspension, require cell-BM interactions to propagate prolactin signals. Using primary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial cells, we recently demonstrated that BM contributes to prolactin-dependent transcription of milk protein genes by regulating the DNA binding activity of Stat5 (20Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B.A. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Only cells cultured on BM and stimulated with prolactin were able to induce Stat5 activity and produce milk proteins, whereas cells on collagen I did not respond to hormone because they showed no Stat5 activity or milk protein synthesis after prolonged culture with prolactin. These results showed that mammary cells exhibit a strong dependence on both prolactin and BM for Stat 5 DNA binding activity, and we argued that this provided a molecular mechanism to explain the regulation of milk protein gene transcription by the ECM (20Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B.A. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this paper we examine whether BM regulates Stat5 DNA binding activity directly or through a control on its upstream signaling components Jak2 and PrlR. In short term experiments where Stat5 activity was induced after 15 min of hormone treatment, we found that BM was required for prolactin signaling both at the level of its receptor as well as Jak2. Moreover, the lack of differentiation in mammary cells cultured on collagen I was additionally due to a vanadate-sensitive activity that inhibited phosphorylation of PrlR, Jak2, and Stat5. Thus, in the absence of correct ECM signals PTPs appear to inhibit cytokine-triggered second messengers, providing a novel paradigm for the mechanism of ECM signaling. Mammary epithelial cells were isolated from 14.5–18.5-day pregnant ICR mice and established in culture at a density of 2.5–5 × 105 cells/cm as described (21Pullan S. Streuli C.H. Harris A. Epithelial Cell Culture. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996: 97-121Google Scholar). Cells were plated on dishes coated with either collagen I or laminin-rich BM matrix (12Streuli C.H.

Ltd., Poole, UK) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Advanced Protein Products, Brierley Hill, UK), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Promega Corp., Southampton, UK), 1 mg/ml fetuin, 880 nm insulin, and 2.8 nm hydrocortisone. The cultures were washed extensively, and the medium was changed to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies Ltd., Paisley, Scotland) containing 880 nm insulin, 2.3 nm hydrocortisone) for a further 24–72 h before stimulating with 150 nm prolactin for the prescribed times. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and then extracted into lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mm pepstatin A, 10 mm leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 10 μm ammonium molybdate). After clearing the detergent-insoluble proteins by centrifugation, lysates from equal numbers of cells from the collagen I or BM cultures were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-prolactin receptor antibody 46 (22Dusanter Fourt I. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Houdebine L.M. Teyssot B. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or anti-Stat5a and anti-Stat5b antibodies (23Liu X.W. Robinson G.W. Hennighausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) followed by protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) before separation by 6.25% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Ltd., Watford, UK), phosphorylated proteins were revealed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham International plc, Little Chalfont, UK). Blots were stripped according to the Amersham protocol and reprobed with precipitating antibody. In some experiments where vanadate was used, sodium pervanadate was freshly prepared by mixing equal volumes of 20 mm sodium orthovanadate and 20 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 min at room temperature. 100 units catalase was added to destroy any unreacted hydrogen peroxide, and the sodium pervanadate was kept on ice. Cells were incubated in fresh medium for 2 h before changing to differentiation medium containing 25 μm sodium pervanadate for 45 or 120 min. 150 nm prolactin was added for specified times prior to harvesting. Primary cultures of mammary epithelial cells from pregnant ICR mice were harvested by trypsinization. Cell pellets were snap frozen in liquid N2, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described (24Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). The total protein concentration was estimated by the Pierce BCA protein assay (Pierce and Warriner (UK) Ltd., Chester, UK), and 4 μg extract was incubated with 0.5 ng of end-labeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (i.e. the Stat5 STM site, 5′-GATTCCGGGAACCGCGT; Ref. 25Burdon T.G. Demmer J. Clark A.J. Watson C.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) as described (26Welte T. Garimorth K. Philipp S. Doppler W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1091-1102PubMed Google Scholar) excluding the addition of single-stranded competitor oligodeoxynucleotide. The nuclear extract was added as the final component of the reaction. In supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with antibodies to Stat1 (M22), Stat 3 (C20), Stat5a (L20), or Stat5b (C17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) before addition of DNA. To determine the point of intersection of the BM stimulus with the prolactin cassette, we used a short term assay where the prolactin signaling proteins were rapidly activated in primary cultures of mouse mammary epithelial cells. In this assay, the transcription factor Stat5 was activated 15 min after hormone treatment in cells contacting a reconstituted BM but not in those on the stromal matrix, collagen I (Fig. 1, A and B). The extent of tyrosine phosphorylation in the prolactin signaling proteins was examined, and all the components were found to be phosphorylated in response to hormone in cells cultured on BM but not in cells on collagen (Fig. 1, C–F). In addition, prolactin treatment resulted in an apparent increase in the molecular weight of Stat5b (27Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, in adherent mammary cells, there is an ECM-specific component of prolactin signaling that acts at the level of the PrlR. Integrins are required for prolactin-dependent milk protein synthesis (13Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), indicating that the differentiation signal from BM positively influences the prolactin cassette (Fig. 1 G), either directly through receptor clustering (28Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) or indirectly through an additional pathway. The lack of signaling in mammary cells cultured on collagen I was not simply due to a delayed prolactin response, because Jak2 phosphorylation and Stat5 DNA binding activity were not detected in cells treated for up to 2 days with prolactin. 2G. M. Edwards and C. H. Streuli, unpublished data. However, in cultures on BM, we noted that the early signaling events were transient. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 (Fig. 2 A) and co-immunoprecipitated PrlR (Fig. 2, A and B) and of Stat5a and Stat5b (Fig. 2, C and D) as well as Stat5 DNA binding activity (Fig. 2 E) occurred rapidly before diminishing to basal levels within 60–120 min. To determine whether this down-regulation of the prolactin cassette shortly after its initial activation was controlled by a PTP activity (29Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar), mammary epithelial cells cultured on BM were incubated with low concentrations (25 μm) of the PTP inhibitor sodium pervanadate (30Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treating cells with prolactin for 120 min, Stat5a and Stat5b retained the maximum level of phosphorylation that had been achieved in vanadate-free cultures (Fig. 2, C and D). The protein levels remained constant throughout the experimental period, indicating that they were first phosphorylated in response to hormone but were subsequently dephosphorylated. Thus, the prolactin-induced phosphorylation of Jak2, PrlR, and Stat5 is transient, and once activated the pathway subsequently comes under negative control by a PTP that reduces the signal 30–60 min after initiation. We then asked whether the initial events leading to activation of Stat5 were also influenced by vanadate-sensitive mechanism. Mammary cells cultured on BM were treated with sodium pervanadate for 30 min and then incubated for an additional 15 min with or without prolactin. PTP inhibitor treatment led to hormone-independent activation of the prolactin signaling cassette including the phosphorylation of Jak2, PrlR, Stat5a, and Stat5b (Fig. 3 A) as well as the induction of Stat5 DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B), which was confirmed by supershift assays (Fig. 3 C). Prolactin triggers Jak-Stat signaling through receptor dimerization, which leads to phosphorylation of Jak2 (14Campbell G.S. Argetsinger L.S. Ihle J.N. Kelly P.A. Rillema J.A. Cartersu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 15Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14021-14026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rui H. Kirken R.A. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5364-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but our data now show that PTP inhibition also contributes to Jak2 activation. This suggests that a PTP and a kinase are normally functionally associated to suppress prolactin signaling, but this can be overcome by either the natural ligand, prolactin, or by artificial inhibitors of PTPs (Fig. 3 D). Although vanadate resulted in ligand-independent Stat5 DNA binding, milk proteins were not synthesized even in the presence of prolactin 3F. H. Wilford and C. H. Streuli, unpublished data. ; an additional PTP may therefore be required (31Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) for Stat5 to induce milk protein gene transcription (19Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), or alternatively, Stat1 and Stat3, which were also activated under these conditions (Fig. 3 C), may compete for Stat5 DNA binding sites. Our observation that PTPs may be involved with initial events of prolactin signaling suggested that PTPs might also be implicated in the lack of response to prolactin in mammary cells cultured on collagen I (Fig. 1). Cells on collagen were treated similarly with sodium pervanadate. Now hormone stimulation led to the phosphorylation of Jak2, PrlR, and Stat5 proteins (Fig. 4 A). Thus, in contrast to cells on BM, prolactin signaling is inhibited in cells on collagen I by a PTP that cannot be inactivated by the hormone alone. We noted that the pathway could not be stimulated fully by pervanadate in cells cultured on collagen I. Although Stat5b was tyrosine phosphorylated, it was only partially altered in molecular weight (Fig. 4 A), and no Stat5 DNA binding activity (Fig. 4 B) or milk protein synthesis3 was observed even in the presence of prolactin. This indicates that additional factors, for example cell geometry (32Roskelley C.D. Desprez P.Y. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12378-12382Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar,33Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar), contribute to differentiation. Together the data show that one role for BM in mammary differentiation is to regulate the PTP/PTK balance, thereby allowing prolactin to trigger its signaling cassette (Fig. 4 C). Two important conclusions can be derived from this study. First, one mechanism by which BM regulates milk protein gene transcription is by permitting prolactin to trigger the intracellular phosphorylation cascade, which leads to Stat5 transcription factor activation. Second, there is a vanadate-sensitive inhibition of prolactin signaling when mammary cells are cultured on collagen, indicating an involvement of PTPs in cell regulation by ECM. In earlier studies we demonstrated that Stat5 DNA binding activity could only be detected in mammary cells cultured on BM, not in cells on collagen (20Streuli C.H. Edwards G.M. Delcommenne M. Whitelaw C.B.A. Burdon T.G. Schindler C. Watson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21639-21644Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and therefore argued that the previously established role for BM on milk protein synthesis (12Streuli C.H. Schmidhauser C. Bailey N. Yurchenco P. Skubitz A.P.N. Roskelley C. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 34Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Aggeler J. Ram T.G. Bissell M.J. Development. 1989; 105: 223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was exerted at the level of transcription factor activation. We now show that BM signals interact with the prolactin pathway upstream of Stat5 at the plasma membrane. These results indicate that in adherent mammary epithelial cells, the prolactin pathway is not controlled simply by the presence of an endogenous cytokine as it is in hematopoietic cells (14Campbell G.S. Argetsinger L.S. Ihle J.N. Kelly P.A. Rillema J.A. Cartersu C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 15Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Sofer L. Ullrich A.

A. 1994; 91: 6850-6854Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but rather it is under positive regulation from both the cytokine and a specific type of ECM. Because β1 integrins are essential for milk protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells (13Streuli C.H. Bailey N. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1383-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), the BM-integrin interaction may result in the formation of a physical complex with PrlR signaling components as is the case with αvβ3 integrin and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (35Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), or alternatively there may be indirect cross-talk between integrin and cytokine receptors. It has been suggested that there is a hierarchical accumulation of many different components within an integrin signaling complex (36Yamada K.M. Geiger B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Indeed, adhesion complexes containing integrins and signaling proteins such as pp125FAK, pp60c-Src, phospholipase C-γ, Rho, Ras, and mitogen-activated protein kinase have been identified (28Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar,37Plopper G.E. McNamee H.P. Dike L.E. Bojanowski K. Ingber D.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and moreover integrins have been found to be associated with IRS-1 (38Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1994; 266: 1576-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), Shc (39Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (35Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A model has therefore emerged whereby integrins assemble appropriate signaling molecules into a complex, which can respond to growth factor and cytokine stimulation. This provides one potential mechanism for ECM involvement in proliferation, where growth factors and ECM cooperate to trigger the signaling cassettes that ultimately result in cyclin D-cdk4/6 and cyclin E-cdk2 complex activation (6Zhu X.Y. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar) and progression through the cell cycle (2Assoian R.K. Zhu X.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 35Schneller M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5600-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that ECM also controls cytokine-triggered pathways regulating differentiation. By analogy with the proliferation model, the differentiation signal from BM may arise from interactions within multiprotein signaling complexes containing both integrin and prolactin receptors, and one of our current goals is to determine whether this is the case. Regulation of homeostasis within the cell by PTKs is mediated by PTPs (8Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 9Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The involvement of PTPs in cell signaling pathways has frequently been assessed by the use of vanadate (30Posner B.I. Faure R. Burgess J.W. Bevan A.P. Lachance D. Zhang-Sun G. Fantus I.G. Ng J.B. Hall D.A. Lum B.S. Shaver A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4596-4604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Huyer G.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 42Sabe H. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), because there are virtually no inhibitory reagents currently available for specific members of the PTP family. Our results indicate that there are at least three vanadate-sensitive steps in prolactin signaling in mammary cells. First, the down-regulation of Stat5 phosphorylation 120 min after prolactin treatment was inhibited by vanadate. The PTP, SHP-1, inactivates the homologous erythropoietin signaling pathway by binding to the erythropoietin receptor shortly after initial activation (29Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In addition, SHP-1 binds tyrosine phosphorylated Stat5 after growth hormone activation and mediates its dephosphorylation (43Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus, our results may reflect a similar involvement of PTP in attenuating prolactin-triggered signaling in mammary cells. Second, the initial phosphorylation events in prolactin signaling were independent of ligand following short treatments with low concentrations of vanadate. Given that prolactin is currently perceived to activate its signaling pathway through the PTK, Jak2 (44Hynes N.E. Cella N. Wartmann M. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), our results suggest that Jak2 may normally be under negative regulation by a PTP. One action of prolactin-mediated ligation of its receptor may therefore be to alter the balance of a PTP-Jak2 cycle rather than merely activate the kinase. Third, in mammary cells cultured on collagen, vanadate enabled prolactin to trigger the early phosphorylation events in its signaling pathway. The implication is that in the absence of correct ECM signals, a PTP may inhibit cytokine-dependent signaling. This represents a novel aspect of ECM control on cell differentiation. We do not yet know the identity of the putative PTP(s) involved with ECM signaling in mammary cells or indeed whether the regulation is through PTP-interacting proteins such as signal-regulatory proteins (45Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 6887-6899Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 46Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, the results suggest that PTPs may contribute to selectivity of integrin responses for controlling differentiation. For example, the laminin-binding integrins α2β1, α3β1, and α6β1 are all expressed in mammary epithelial cells (47Delcommenne M. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26794-26801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) but α2β1 is preferentially used for interactions with collagen I, whereas α3β1 and α6β1 interact with laminin (48Howlett A.R. Bailey N. Damsky C. Petersen O.W. Bissell M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1945-1957PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a PTP might either be inactivated by a specific integrin-dependent cell interaction with BM, thereby promoting a phosphorylation cascade after ligand stimulation, or alternatively the PTP might not be recruited to BM-induced adhesion complexes. An analogous situation may arise in the control of ECM interactions on other aspects of cell phenotype. For example, growth factors are unable to induce proliferation and promote survival in cells cultured in suspension (2Assoian R.K. Zhu X.Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Meredith J.E. Winitz S. Lewis J.M. Hess S. Ren X.D. Renshaw M.W. Schwartz M.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because the inhibition of cell-ECM interactions in fibroblasts leads to increased PTP activity (49Maher P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11177-11181Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the inability to respond to soluble factors may be partly due to activation of PTPs. Early events in cell adhesion to ECM have been associated with altered tyrosine phosphorylation, which appears to be important for recruitment of cytoskeleton to adhesion complexes (7Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Altered phosphorylation following vanadate treatment may therefore influence cytoskeletal organization and thereby affect prolactin receptor dimerization or other receptor proximal kinases involved in prolactin signaling. However, immunofluorescent examination of the actin- and tubulin-based cytoskeleton in mammary cells indicated that there was no disruption of the cytoskeleton following short term treatment with vanadate. 4G. M. Edwards, G. Zoubiane, and C. H. Streuli, unpublished data. This contrasts with the action of cytochalasin D where the actin-containing structures in similar cultures were severely perturbed within 30 min. PTPs have previously been shown to be involved in the regulation of signaling by cytokines (31Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 29Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar) and may also participate in cell-cell communication (50Fuchs M. Muller T. Lerch M.M. Ullrich A. J. Biol.

We now propose that PTPs are targets for the ECM signals that regulate differentiation in mammary cells, possibly through direct interaction with proteins within adhesion complexes (53Serra Pages C.

Maassen J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our work offers a new paradigm to explain cell regulation by ECM, in which signals from correct integrin-ECM interactions positively influence cytokine-induced differentiation, whereas PTP-mediated inhibition of cytokine signaling occurs when cells are in an inappropriate ECM environment. We are grateful to Drs. Paul Clarke, David Garrod, Andrew Gilmore, and Martin Humphries for critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2052897173,"Two serologically distinct type I interferons (IFNs), designated ChIFN1 and ChIFN2, are known in the chicken. ChIFN1 is encoded by a family of 10 or more genes, whereas ChIFN2 is encoded by a single gene. We show here that ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 transcripts are both strongly induced by Newcastle disease virus in primary chicken macrophages. By contrast, oral administration of the imidazoquinoline S-28463, which selectively induces IFN-α in mammals, led to a rapid accumulation of ChIFN1 (but not ChIFN2) transcripts in adult chicken spleen and thymus. The 5′-upstream region of the ChIFN2gene contains a NF-κB consensus motif flanked by a sequence element that could serve as a binding site for transcription factor IRF-1, reminiscent of mammalian IFN-β promoters, and it mediated powerful virus inducibility in a duck fibroblast cell line when cloned in front of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene. The 5′-upstream region of the cloned ChIFN1 gene contains two putative binding sites for IRF-1, but lacks NF-κB-binding sites, and it did not respond well to virus in transfected cells. Thus, the promoters ofChIFN1 and ChIFN2 genes not only exhibited differential responses to nonviral inducers in vivo, but also differed in structure and response to virus in transfected cells.

Interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFNs, interferons; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: IFNs, interferons; NDV, Newcastle disease virus; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s). are cytokines that exhibit antiviral activity. IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-δ, IFN-ω, and IFN-τ, which all signal through the same cell-surface receptor complex, are collectively designated type I IFNs. IFN-γ, which employs a different receptor complex for signaling, is referred to as type II IFN. In probably all mammals, it is coded for by a single intron-containing gene whose expression is induced by antigens and mitogens (1Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar). A typical feature of type I IFN genes is that they lack introns (2De Mayer E.M. De Mayer-Guinard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω genes are induced in response to virus in many cell types (3Weissmann C. Weber H. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1986; 33: 251-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas IFN-δ and IFN-τ genes are induced in response to developmental signals in trophoblasts of pigs and ruminants, respectively (4Lefevre F. Boulay V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19760-19768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Leaman D.W. Roberts M. J. Interferon Res. 1992; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). IFN-α is encoded by a gene family in mammals (6Joklik W.K. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Virology. Raven Press, New York1990: 383-410Google Scholar), whereas IFN-β is encoded by a single gene in humans and several other species (2De Mayer E.M. De Mayer-Guinard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar), but by a small gene family in cattle (7Wilson V. Jeffreys A.J. Barrie P.A. Boseley P.G. Slocombe P.M. Easton A. Burke D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Based on amino acid comparisons, it was calculated that IFN-α and IFN-β have arisen by a gene duplication event that occurred at least 250 million years ago (2De Mayer E.M. De Mayer-Guinard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar), probably before the mammals-birds/reptiles divergence. Genes for IFN-ω are found in humans and several other mammals, but not, for example, in dog and rodents (8Roberts R.M. Liu L. Alexenko A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 287-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), indicating that IFN-ω is phylogenetically much younger than IFN-α and IFN-β. The IFN system of birds has only recently been characterized at the molecular level. A cDNA for a virus-induced chicken IFN was first described by Sekellick et al. (9Sekellick M.J. Ferrandino A.F. Hopkins D.A Marcus P.I. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein generated from this cDNA exhibited some biochemical features that are typical for type I IFN (10Schultz U. Kaspers B. Rinderle C. Sekellick M.J. Marcus P.I. Staeheli P. Eur. J.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA analysis revealed that the chicken contains several genes that code for two serologically distinct forms of type I IFN, designated ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). ChIFN1 is encoded by a family of 10 or more intronless genes, whereas ChIFN2 is encoded by a single gene that also lacks introns. The various ChIFN1 gene products are >98% identical, whereas ChIFN2 is only ∼57% identical to ChIFN1 (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

Although type I IFNs of chicken and mammals appear to have related structures, their primary sequences show <30% similarity. Consequently, it could not be decided on this basis which of the two chicken IFNs represents the avian equivalent of mammalian IFN-α and IFN-β. A cDNA for chicken IFN-γ has been cloned only recently (13Weining K.C. Schultz U. Münster U. Kaspers B. Staeheli P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2440-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 14Digby M.R. Lowenthal J.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that lead to transcriptional activation of mammalian IFN-α and IFN-β genes in response to virus have been studied in great detail, and the important regulatory sequences and transcription factors were characterized (15Ryals J. Dierks P. Ragg H. Weissmann C. Cell. 1985; 41: 497-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Kuhl D. de la Fuente J. Chaturvedi M. Parimoo S. Ryals J. Meyer F. Weissmann C.

The virus response elements in the promoters of the human IFN-α1 gene (18MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Buehler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner J. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the mouse IFN-α4 gene (19Au W.C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Google Scholar) have binding sites for IRF-1 and a virus-induced DNA-binding protein designated TG factor (18MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Buehler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner J. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or αF1-binding protein (20Au W.C. Su Y. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cooperation of these two factors seems to be required for efficient virus-mediated induction of IFN-α genes (18MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Buehler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner J. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 20Au W.C. Su Y. Raj N.B.K. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24032-24040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter of the human IFN-β gene contains two distinct positive and one negative regulatory domain (21Fan C.M. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Virus induction requires cooperative interaction between the two positive regulatory domains, which represent binding sites for IRF-1 or a related transcription factor and NF-κB, respectively (22Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Thus, although some aspects of the regulation of mammalian IFN-α and IFN-β genes are conserved, the selective binding of unique transcription factors seems to determine specificity. The involvement of either NF-κB or the TG factor appears to be responsible for the cell type-specific selective induction of IFN-α and IFN-β genes in response to different viruses. Some nonviral IFN inducers were reported to be effective in cells of various mammals (23Tomai M.A. Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Miller R.L. Myhre P.E. Reiter M.J. Wagner T.L. Tamulinas C.B. Beaurline J.M. Gerster J.F. Horton V.L. Antiviral Res. 1995; 28: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and chicken (24Karaca K. Sharma J.M. Tomai M.A. Miller R.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), of which the imidazoquinoline S-28463 is the most powerful agent known to date (23Tomai M.A. Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Miller R.L. Myhre P.E. Reiter M.J. Wagner T.L. Tamulinas C.B. Beaurline J.M. Gerster J.F. Horton V.L. Antiviral Res. 1995; 28: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Oral as well as parenteral applications of imidazoquinolines are effective in vivo (23Tomai M.A. Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Miller R.L. Myhre P.E. Reiter M.J. Wagner T.L. Tamulinas C.B. Beaurline J.M. Gerster J.F. Horton V.L. Antiviral Res. 1995; 28: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Imidazoquinolines were found to strongly induce the synthesis of IFN-α, but not IFN-β or IFN-ω, as evident from the fact that the antiviral activity induced by this drug could be neutralized very effectively with antisera against IFN-α (25Weeks C.E. Gibson S.J. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, monocytes are mainly responsible for IFN synthesis in response to imidazoquinolines (26Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Wagner T.L. Testerman T.L. Reiter M.J. Miller R.L. Tomai M.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). An antiviral activity was present in the serum and spleen cell supernatants of chickens treated with an imidazoquinoline that was neutralized by antiserum raised against recombinant ChIFN1 (24Karaca K. Sharma J.M. Tomai M.A. Miller R.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). No information is available on the signaling pathways leading to IFN gene activation in mammalian or avian cells after treatment with imidazoquinolines. In this study, we examined the expression of the ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 genes in response to viral and nonviral inducers and characterized their promoters. Both IFNs were induced equally well by virus in primary macrophages. However, preferential expression ofChIFN1 was observed in lymphoid organs of chickens treated with the imidazoquinoline S-28463, suggesting that this IFN represents the avian homolog of IFN-α. The presence of a NF-κB consensus motif in the promoter of the ChIFN2 (but not ChIFN1) gene further supports the concept that ChIFN2 is the avian homolog of mammalian IFN-β. The chicken fibroblast cell line CEC-32 (27Kaaden O.R. Lange S. Stiburek B. In Vitro (Rockville). 1982; 18: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the chicken macrophage cell line HD-11 (28Beug H. von Kirchbach A. Doederlein G. Conscience J.-F. Graf T. Cell. 1979; 18: 375-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and 2% chicken serum. The duck embryo cell line DEC141 (ATCC CCL141) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 5% chicken serum. Primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages were isolated from peripheral blood as described (29Peck R. Murthy K.K. Vainio O. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 4-5PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation, the lymphocytes in the interphase were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and plated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After 3 days of cultivation, the nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline. The adherent cells, most of which were macrophages, were induced with virus as described below. NDV (strain H53) was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Allantoic fluids harvested 2 days after virus inoculation usually contained ∼5 × 108 infectious units of virus/ml. For IFN induction experiments, virus stocks were diluted 10-fold in serum-free culture medium and treated with UV light as described (30Bazzigher L. Pavlovic J. Haller O. Staeheli P. Virology. 1992; 186: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). 10 ml of this material were used to infect the cells in a 90-mm dish. White Leghorn chickens were treated orally with 2 mg of S-28463/kg of body weight. 2 h after drug application, the animals were killed, and RNA was extracted from various organs. The ChIFN1 promoter constructs were generated by PCR from a plasmid that contained a 2.8-kbKpnI fragment of chromosomal chicken DNA that contained the 5′-noncoding region and the open reading frame of the ChIFN1-2 gene (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PCR was performed with an oligonucleotide primer corresponding to plasmid sequence and with primer 1 (5′-GACAGAGATCTGGTGGGACTCGCG-3′), which is complementary to nucleotides −13 to −1 of the ChIFN1-2 upstream sequence (see Fig. 3 A) and which contains a new BglII restriction site. An aliquot of the amplified product was digested withBglII, which also cuts in the plasmid multicloning site, and the resulting 1.8-kb fragment was cloned in the correct orientation upstream of the luciferase gene of the plasmid pGL-2basic, generating construct Δ-1.8kbChIFN1-2. Another aliquot of the same PCR product was digested with EcoRV and BglII, and the resulting 0.7-kb fragment was ligated between the SmaI and BglII sites of pGL-2basic, generating construct Δ-699ChIFN1-2. A 2.8-kb SacI fragment of the λ phage clone 1/4 (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) containing 2.6 kb of the 5′-noncoding region immediately upstream of the ChIFN2 open reading frame was used as template for PCR. PCR was performed with oligonucleotide primer 2 (5′-AGAGGAGCTCCTCCCACTCTGG-3′), which corresponds to nucleotides −687 to −676 (see Fig. 3 B) and which carries a newSacI restriction site, and primer 3 (5′-GACTTAGATCTAACCTTGGTGG-3′), which is complementary to nucleotides +60 to +71 and which carries a new BglII restriction site. To generate the Δ-687ChIFN2 promoter construct, the PCR product was digested with SacI and BglII and ligated between the SacI and BglII sites of pGL-2basic. For creating the Δ-149ChIFN2 construct, the PCR product was digested withRsaI, blunted, and digested with BglII, and the resulting 220-bp fragment was ligated between the SmaI and BglII sites of pGL-2basic. The same PCR product was digested with EcoRI, blunted, digested with BglII, and ligated between the SmaI and BglII sites of pGL-2basic, resulting in the construct Δ-60ChIFN2. A fragment obtained after PCR using primer 3 and primer 4 (5′-TAGACGAGCTCCAAGGGAATTCTC-3′), which corresponds to positions −65 to −53 of the ChIFN2 gene (see Fig. 3 B) and which carries a new SacI restriction site, was digested withSacI and BglII before the resulting 135-bp fragment was cloned between the SacI and BglII sites of pGL-2basic to generate construct Δ-65ChIFN2. To generate the DNA template for in vitro synthesis of RNA complementary to the ChIFN2 promoter region, the 220-bpRsaI-BglII fragment of the ChIFN2promoter described above was ligated between the SmaI and BglII sites of vector pSP72, generating construct pChIFN2-RPA. Total RNA from cultured cells was prepared by the acid/guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63084) Google Scholar). For extraction of total RNA from organs, the tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Frozen tissue (samples of 1 g) were thawed and homogenized in guanidium isothiocyanate buffer before RNA was extracted as described above. RNAs were separated by electrophoresis through 1.2% agarose gels containing 4% formaldehyde, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized to radiolabeled DNA probes as described above. For synthesis of radiolabeled antisense RNA, pChIFN2-RPA was linearized with XbaI and transcribed with T7 polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP. In vitro transcription and RNase treatment were carried out using the RiboQuant™ kit (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). The radiolabeled antisense RNA was hybridized overnight to 10 μg of total RNA at 56 °C. After RNase treatment, the sample was denatured and separated by electrophoresis through a denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel. The size of the protected RNA fragments was estimated using appropriate DNA length standards. DEC141 cells were plated in 6-well dishes and transfected with 5-μg samples of the various luciferase reporter constructs by the calcium phosphate method according to standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). At ∼30 h post-transfection, the cultures were infected with NDV for 6 or 15 h, before cell lysates were prepared, and the luciferase activity was determined by standard procedures (33Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). To determine whether the two previously described families of chicken type I IFN genes (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) could both be induced in response to virus infection, we exposed the fibroblast cell line CEC-32, primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages, and the macrophage cell line HD-11 to UV-inactivated NDV. Total RNA was extracted from the various cell cultures at 6 h post-infection and analyzed by Northern blotting for the presence of IFN transcripts. Under the high stringency washing conditions used, hybridization of ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 cDNA probes was mainly to their respective transcripts, and cross-hybridization was minimal (data not shown). High concentrations of ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 RNAs were present in the virus-induced primary macrophages (Fig. 1). By contrast, neither ChIFN1 nor ChIFN2 transcripts could be detected in the two permanent cell lines under these conditions. We further failed to detect ChIFN1 or ChIFN2 transcripts in NDV-treated primary chicken embryo cells (data not shown). Oral administration of the imidazoquinoline S-28463 induces IFN-α and other cytokines in mammals (23Tomai M.A. Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Miller R.L. Myhre P.E. Reiter M.J. Wagner T.L. Tamulinas C.B. Beaurline J.M. Gerster J.F. Horton V.L. Antiviral Res. 1995; 28: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether administration of this substance would induce both gene families that encode type I IFN in chickens. High levels of ChIFN1 transcripts were detected in the spleens and thymuses of two chickens treated for 2 h with 2 mg of S-28463/kg of body weight, whereas the corresponding organs of the untreated control chicken did not contain detectable amounts of this RNA (Fig. 2). ChIFN1 RNA was also found in the liver of one drug-treated animal, whereas a second treated animal and the control animal did not contain detectable amounts of ChIFN1 transcripts in this organ. The bursae of all three chickens lacked ChIFN1 RNA. A time course experiment showed that the response to S-28463 was very rapid and transient: ChIFN1 transcripts appeared in the spleens of treated animals within 1 h, reached a maximum after ∼2 h, and were no longer detectable at 4 h post drug application (data not shown). Interestingly, we failed to detect transcripts for ChIFN2 in the various organs of drug-treated chickens (Fig. 2), indicating that at least one member of the ChIFN1 gene family responded much better to stimulation with S-28463 than the ChIFN2 gene. Neither ChIFN1 nor ChIFN2 transcripts were detected in primary blood monocyte-derived macrophages that were treated with 3 μg/ml S-28463 for 3 or 6 h (data not shown). Since the IFN-α genes are selectively induced by imidazoquinolines in mammals (25Weeks C.E. Gibson S.J. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), this result suggested that the ChIFN1 genes, rather than the ChIFN2 gene, might represent the avian counterparts of mammalian IFN-α. To further study the regulation of the chicken IFN genes, we sequenced the upstream regions of one member of the ChIFN1 gene family (ChIFN1-2) (Fig. 3 A) and of the singleChIFN2 gene (Fig. 3 B). Both upstream sequences lacked classical TATA boxes and most other regulatory elements frequently found in promoters of mammalian genes. About 160 and 120 bp upstream of the beginning of the ChIFN1 open reading frame, we identified two sequence elements that might represent binding sites for transcription factor IRF-1 (Fig. 3 A and Ref. 34Miyamoto M. Fujita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), previously found to be part of the virus response elements of the mammalian IFN-α and IFN-β gene promoters (18MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Buehler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner J. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). About 130 bp upstream of the beginning of the ChIFN2 open reading frame, we identified a consensus binding motif for the transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 3 B), which plays a critical role in the virus response of mammalian IFN-β genes, but not IFN-α genes (22Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Immediately upstream of the putative NF-κB-binding site of the ChIFN2 promoter, we found a sequence element that resembles the binding site for mammalian transcription factors of the IRF family (Fig. 3 B). To test for promoter activity, the upstream regions of the ChIFN1-2 and ChIFN2 genes were cloned in the correct orientation in front of a promoterless luciferase reporter gene. The resulting constructs were then transfected into DEC141 cells, a permanent fibroblast duck cell line that readily synthesizes IFN in response to infection with NDV. 2U. Schultz, unpublished results. The DEC141 cells were incubated with UV-inactivated NDV for either 6 or 15 h before the cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity. A DNA fragment derived from the ChIFN1-2 gene that included the 699 nucleotides located immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon conferred significant but rather poor inducibility to virus in this system (see Fig. 5): its expression increased not more than 5-fold in response to virus infection. The performance of the ChIFN1promoter was not improved when a larger fragment was used that included ∼1.8 kb of upstream sequence (construct Δ-1.8kbChIFN1-2 in Fig. 5). By contrast, the ∼750 nucleotides located upstream of the ChIFN2 open reading frame conferred very strong inducibility to virus: the activity of this promoter was some 40-fold higher in NDV-infected cells than in uninfected control cells (see Fig. 5). It thus appeared that the upstream region of the ChIFN2 gene harbored a very potent virus response element. To characterize the ChIFN2 promoter in more detail, we first determined the transcriptional start site of this gene. An RNase protection experiment was performed with RNA from virus-induced primary chicken macrophages and radiolabeled in vitro synthesized antisense RNA derived from a DNA fragment carrying the ChIFN2 upstream region (see “Materials and Methods”). We found that ChIFN2 transcripts have heterogeneous 5′-ends (Fig. 4). From their lengths, we calculated that transcription from the ChIFN2 gene initiates at six major sites located 71, 67, 63, 47, 44, and 41 nucleotides upstream of the open reading frame, the most upstream of which was defined as position +1 (Figs. Fig. 3 B and 4). By determining the activity of constructs containing shortened fragments of the ChIFN2 upstream region, we tried to define the minimal promoter sequence capable of mediating strong virus inducibility to the luciferase reporter gene. A DNA fragment comprising the ChIFN2 sequences between positions −149 and +70 mediated full-scale virus inducibility (Fig. 5), indicating that it contained all major regulatory elements. Further truncations of this fragment at the 5′-end to position −60 (destroying the NF-κB and IRF motifs) and to position −65 (destroying the IRF motif, but sparing the NF-κB motif) abolished the virus response almost completely (Fig. 5). Based on coding sequence comparisons, it could previously not be decided which of the two serologically distinct type I IFNs of chickens was the true homolog of IFN-α, IFN-β, or IFN-ω (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was also unclear whether the ChIFN2 gene was inducible by virus or whether it would not respond to this stimulus, like IFN-τ of ruminants (5Leaman D.W. Roberts M. J. Interferon Res. 1992; 12: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and IFN-δ of pigs (4Lefevre F. Boulay V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19760-19768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that ChIFN2 is encoded by a single gene like human and murine IFN-β was not sufficient evidence for a final assignment, as IFN-β is encoded by a family of genes in bovines and other species (7Wilson V. Jeffreys A.J. Barrie P.A. Boseley P.G. Slocombe P.M. Easton A. Burke D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We now found that bothChIFN gene families are strongly induced by NDV in primary macrophages, indicating that they cannot be the chicken homologs of mammalian IFN-τ or IFN-δ. High levels of ChIFN1 (but not ChIFN2) transcripts were present in lymphoid organs of chickens treated with the imidazoquinoline S-28463. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, this drug induces an antiviral activity that can be neutralized almost completely with antiserum to IFN-α (25Weeks C.E. Gibson S.J. J. Interferon Res. 1994; 14: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Since such antisera are usually highly specific and do not cross-react with IFN-ω or IFN-β (35Adolf G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 1669-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it appears that imidazoquinolines selectively induce IFN-α. Our results therefore suggest that ChIFN1 is the chicken homolog of mammalian IFN-α. We further found that the promoter of the ChIFN2 gene contains a NF-κB consensus motif, whereas the ChIFN1 promoter lacks such a motif. This difference in promoter structure is reminiscent of mammalian IFN genes, where NF-κB motifs are exclusively found in IFN-β promoters (21Fan C.M. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence that ChIFN2 represents the avian IFN-β homolog, whereas ChIFN1 seems to be the homolog of mammalian IFN-α. This conclusion is compatible with phylogenetic analyses of mammalian type I IFN genes, which suggested that the gene duplication event that gave rise to IFN-α and IFN-β occurred before the mammals-birds/reptiles divergence (2De Mayer E.M. De Mayer-Guinard J. Interferons and Other Regulatory Cytokines. Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). The ChIFN2 promoter contains a NF-κB-binding site located some 60 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site, which is preceded by a sequence motif that resembles the binding site of mammalian transcription factors of the IRF family. A promoter fragment containing these putative regulatory elements was sufficient to mediate virus inducibility, whereas constructs lacking either the IRF motif or both motifs no longer responded to virus. NF-κB-binding sites are present at corresponding positions in the promoters of human and murine IFN-β genes, where they constitute the positive regulatory domain II (22Lenardo M.J. Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 287-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 36Garoufalis E. Kwan I. Lin R. Mustafa A. Pepin M. Rouston A. Lacoste J. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding sites for IRF-1 or related transcription factors (21Fan C.M. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) are present immediately upstream of the NF-κB site, where they constitute the positive regulatory domain I in human and murine IFN-β promoters. Taken together, these observations suggest that conserved signal pathways are responsible for the activation of the ChIFN2 and mammalian IFN-β promoters. A more refined analysis of the ChIFN2 promoter and binding studies with purified transcription factors are required to confirm this concept. Except for two IRF-binding sites, the promoter region of the clonedChIFN1 gene contains no sequence motifs with obvious similarity to virus response elements of mammalian IFN genes. Although, as stated above, the lack of a NF-κB site indicates that this gene is not homologous to mammalian IFN-β, we have no clear evidence that the promoter of this gene is organized like that of mammalian IFN-α genes. In particular, we failed to detect a binding motif for the TG factor (18MacDonald N.J. Kuhl D. Maguire D. Näf D. Gallant P. Goswamy A. Hug H. Buehler H. Chaturvedi M. de la Fuente J. Ruffner J. Meyer F. Weissmann C. Cell. 1990; 60: 767-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) or the αF1·B complex (19Au W.C. Raj N.B.K. Pine R. Pitha P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 20: 2877-2884Google Scholar). As our experiments showed that the isolated ChIFN1-2 promoter responded rather poorly to virus in transfected cells, it was formally possible that we cloned the 5′-upstream region of a poorly expressed member of the ChIFN1 gene family that lacks an important regulatory element. This seems unlikely because the promoter region of another gene of the ChIFN1 family (ChIFN1-1 (12Sick C. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7635-7639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) showed that the 400 nucleotides located upstream of the open reading frame were identical to the ChIFN1-2 sequence shown in Fig. 3 A, except for two nucleotide exchanges. In particular, the two putative IRF-binding sites were present at corresponding positions in both promoters. 3C. Sick, unpublished results. Thus, the poor activity of the cloned ChIFN1 promoters might instead be explained by assuming that the duck cell line used for the transfection experiments lacks a transcription factor required for effective regulation of the ChIFN1 genes. In the mammalian system, it is well known that the response of the IFN-α and IFN-β promoters to virus is not uniform, but rather varies considerably between cell lines (37Hiscott J. Cantell K. Weissmann C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3727-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Future experiments using other cell lines should allow optimal conditions to be defined for virus induction of the isolated ChIFN1 promoters. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells treated with S-28463, the monocyte population was found to be the principal producer of IFN-α (26Gibson S.J. Imbertson L.M. Wagner T.L. Testerman T.L. Reiter M.J. Miller R.L. Tomai M.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a previous study (24Karaca K. Sharma J.M. Tomai M.A. Miller R.L. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996; 16: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), spleen cells and blood lymphocytes from imidazoquinoline-treated chickens were found to secrete high amounts of IFN. In agreement with these results, we now found that ChIFN1 transcripts were abundantly present in the spleens and thymuses of drug-treated chickens. Since S-28463 failed to induce ChIFN transcripts in primary macrophages, it seems that IFN present in the serum of imidazoquinoline-treated chickens mainly originates from lymphoid organs. A surprising result of our study was that we failed to induce the chicken IFN genes by Newcastle disease virus in fibroblasts and in a macrophage cell line under conditions that strongly induced ChIFN1 and ChIFN2 transcripts in primary macrophages. Although the molecular basis for nonresponsiveness remains elusive, our findings might explain why efficient production of virus-induced chicken IFN in fibroblasts was successful in the hands of only a few experts after careful conditioning of the cell cultures (38Sekellick M.J. Marcus P.I. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 119: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 39Yoshida I. Marcus P. J. Interferon Res. 1990; 10: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The elaborate conditioning might have induced essential transcription factors that are not constitutively present in most chicken cells. Thus, in agreement with previous findings in the mammalian system (40Hoss A. Zwarthoff E.C. Zawatzky R. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 70: 575-589Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), our results suggest that primary macrophages are the most effective producers of virus-induced IFNs. Our principal finding that mammalian IFN-α and IFN-β probably have their true counterparts in birds supports previous notions (41Schumacher B. Bernasconi D. Schultz U. Staeheli P.

Adenosine influx was mediated by a single high affinity transporter (Km 0.26 ± 0.02 μm, Vmax 0.63 ± 0.18 pmol/107 cells s−1). Purine nucleosides, with the exception of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine), and dipyridamole inhibited adenosine influx (Ki 0.18–5.2 μm). Purine nucleobases and pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleobases had no effect on adenosine transport. This specificity of the transporter appears to be similar to the previously described P1 adenosine transporter in bloodstream forms of trypanosomes. Uptake of adenosine was Na+-independent, but ionophores reducing the membrane potential and/or the transmembrane proton gradient (monitored with the fluorescent probes bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid)-trimethine oxonol and 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester, respectively) inhibited adenosine transport. Similarly, an increase in extracellular pH from 7.3 to 8.0 reduced adenosine influx by 30%. A linear correlation was demonstrated between the rate of adenosine transport and the protonmotive force. Adenosine uptake was accompanied by a proton influx in base-loaded cells and was also shown to be electrogenic. These combined results indicate that transport of adenosine in T. brucei brucei procyclics is protonmotive force-driven and strongly suggest that the adenosine transporter functions as an H+ symporter.

Parasitic protozoa of the Trypanosoma brucei subgroup are the causative agents of African sleeping sickness in man and the related livestock disease, nagana. Parasitic protozoa, includingT. brucei brucei, are unable to synthesize their own purines (1Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), relying on the salvage of preformed purines from the host environment to satisfy their nucleotide requirements. Salvage consists of intracellular and extracellular metabolic events (2Gottlieb M. Gardiner P.R. Dwyer D.M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1986; 83: 63-69Google Scholar, 3Gbenle G.O. Dwyer D.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) plus the permeation of the substrate across the plasma membrane of the parasite. Whereas extensive studies of purine metabolism in the trypanosomatidae have been carried out (for review see Ref. 1Hammond D.J. Gutteridge W.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1984; 13: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the mode by which purines are taken up from the environment by T. brucei has received limited attention. The first report on the uptake of nucleosides by T. brucei appeared in 1980 (4James D.M. Born G.V.R. Parasitology. 1980; 81: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Adenosine uptake was suggested to occur in a manner consistent with two mechanisms, one with high affinity and the other with low affinity for adenosine. However, this study used relatively long incubation times (3 min at 37 °C) which did not correspond to initial rate conditions. More recently, rapid initial adenosine transport fluxes were determined over a period of 0–5 s in bloodstream forms of T. brucei at 25 °C (5Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Two high affinity adenosine transporters (P1 and P2) were identified with apparent Km values for adenosine influx of 0.15 and 0.59 μm, respectively (5Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The P1 system was selectively inhibited by inosine, whereas the P2 transporter was specifically blocked by adenine. Interestingly, one of these carriers (P2) appeared to transport melamino-phenylarsenicals, of which melarsoprol is a front-line drug in the treatment of late stage sleeping sickness (6Apted F.I.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1980; 11: 391-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Wery M. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1991; 4: 838-843Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, melarsen-resistant trypanosomes lacked a functional P2 adenosine transport system (5Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the mechanism of either P1 or P2 adenosine transport is unknown, and the substrate specificity of the two carriers was not fully characterized. During their life cycle, T. brucei live alternatively in the bloodstream of mammalian hosts and in the digestive tracts of tsetse flies. In contrast to the bloodstream forms of T. brucei, nothing is known regarding how nucleosides are transported by procyclic cultured forms, homologous to the insect midgut stage. Given the importance of purine transport to the parasite and the possible involvement of this process in drug uptake and resistance, there is a need for a thorough understanding of nucleoside transport in all forms of this organism. In the present study, a rapid inhibitor oil-stop technique was utilized to investigate adenosine transport in cultured procyclic T. brucei brucei. We show that procyclic forms ofT. brucei brucei possess a single adenosine transporter that apparently accepts only other purine nucleosides and appears to be similar to the P1 adenosine transporter in bloodstream forms ofT. brucei brucei. Moreover, we demonstrate that the adenosine transporter in procyclic forms is protonmotive force-driven. Procyclic forms of T. brucei brucei strain 427 were grown as described by Brun and Schönenberger (8Brun R. Schönenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) in SDM-79 medium. Cells at mid-logarithmic stage of growth were harvested and washed twice in assay buffer (33 mm Hepes, 98 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 0.3 mm CaCl2, 0.07 mmMgSO4, 5.8 mm NaH2PO4, 0.3 mm MgCl2, 23 mmNaHCO3 and 14 mm glucose, pH 7.3). Cells were resuspended in buffer to approximately 108 cells/ml. All measurements and dilutions were performed in assay buffer. Transport was measured by an adaptation of a rapid oil-stop method (9Jarvis S.M. Hammond J.R. Paterson A.R.P. Clanachan A.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). An oil layer was utilized for the separation of cells from incubation medium after transport was stopped by addition of a high concentration of ice-cold unlabeled permeant. The oil used had a density of 1.018 g/ml, composed by mixing 7 volumes of dibutylphthalate (1.043 g/ml) and 1 volume of mineral oil (0.84 g/ml). Assay mixtures were prepared in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Added first was 200 μl of oil upon which was layered 100 μl of transport medium containing 3H-nucleoside (10 μCi/ml). Transport was initiated by addition of 100 μl of procyclic T. brucei brucei cells (≈107). All transport assays were performed at 22 °C and in triplicate. Intervals of transport were terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold stop solution (assay buffer containing 4 mm unlabeled permeant), followed by immediate centrifugation for 30 s at 12,000 × g. To determine the amount of accumulated radioactivity associated with the cell pellet, oil and aqueous layers were removed by suction, and the inside of the tube was wiped with absorbent paper, and the pellet was dissolved in 0.5 m NaOH. Samples were then left overnight. Subsequently, 1 ml of scintillation fluid (Optiphase Hisafe III) was added, and samples were counted in a Beckman LS 6000 TA scintillation counter. Blank values (radioactivity that became associated with cells during uptake intervals of 0 s) were obtained by processing cell samples exposed simultaneously to3H-permeant and 4 mm unlabeled permeant. Where applicable, kinetic constants of influx (apparent Km and Vmax) and inhibition constants (IC50 values and apparent Ki) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of data using appropriate equations and the computer programs Enzfitter (Elsevier Biosoft) and Inplot (Graphpad Software). In inhibition studies, test compounds and [3H]adenosine or [3H]inosine were added to cells simultaneously, except metabolic inhibitors and ionophores that were preincubated with cells for 1–10 min before addition of [3H]adenosine. Stock solutions of metabolic inhibitors and ionophores were made in ethanol, and control studies performed in parallel confirmed that adenosine transport rates were not affected by the final concentration of ethanol (<2%). Transport rates were expressed per 107 cells, and the cell number in suspensions of T. brucei brucei was enumerated using a hemocytometer observed under phase contrast microscopy. The intracellular volume of procyclic forms of T. brucei bruceiwas determined from the distribution ratio at equilibrium of [3H]H2O with either [14C]sucrose or [14C]mannitol as the extracellular marker. Cells were mixed with the two isotopes for 0.5 min and then separated from the extracellular medium by directly centrifuging through the oil layer without the addition of cold stop as described above. Uptake rates as well as Km and Ki values are given ±S.E. unless otherwise indicated. To explore the metabolic fate of transported substrate, the inert oil layer was underlayered with 100 μl of 20% (w/v) perchloric acid. The assay was performed as described for the transport experiments, and cells were spun through the oil layer into the perchloric acid. Upper oil and aqueous layers were removed, and lysate was neutralized with 5 m KOH. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation (2 min, 12,000 × g), and aliquots of the supernatant were subjected to thin layer chromatographic analysis using 0.2-mm plastic sheets coated with silica gel (Merck) in a butan-1-ol, ethyl acetate, methanol, and ammonia (7:4:3:4) solvent system (Rf values of 0, 0.53, 0.63, 0.46, and 0.36 for ATP, adenosine, adenine, hypoxanthine, and inosine, respectively). Bands were located under UV light and scraped into vials for scintillation counting. Greater than 85% of the radioactivity loaded onto the TLC plates was recovered. To load procyclic T. brucei brucei with the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF, 1The abbreviations used are: BCECF/AM, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; bis-oxonol, bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol; pHo, extracellular pH; pHi, intracellular pH; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; DCCD,N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; NBMPR, nitrobenzylthioinosine; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide;Vm, membrane potential; PMF, protonmotive force; NMG+, N-methyl-d-glucamine. cells were washed twice in assay buffer, resuspended in the same buffer containing 5 μm BCECF/AM, and incubated at 25 °C for 1 h at a density of approximately 108 cells/ml. Cells were pelleted and washed twice with assay buffer to remove extracellular dye and resuspended at a final cell density of 108 cells/ml until used. A 3-ml aliquot of BCECF-loaded procyclic cells was transferred to a 1-cm square quartz cuvette and maintained at 25 °C. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B fluorimeter. Excitation (440 and 490 nm) and emission (530 nm) were set at 10-nm bandwidths. The 490 and 440 nm fluorescence intensity signals and the 490/440 ratio signals were continuously monitored. Calibration of intracellular pH (pHi) versus fluorescence was carried out using 20 μm nigericin in a K+-rich Ringers solution (20 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm Mes, and 5 mm Mops) at several different pH levels from 6.2–8.0 as described (10De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Intracellular fluorescence was predominantly localized in the parasite cytosol, as visualized by confocal microscopy. Membrane potential (Vm) was measured and calibrated using the fluorescent anionic probe bis-oxonol as described (10De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with excitation at 540 nm and emission recorded at 580 nm. Briefly, 100 μl of procyclic cells (107) or assay buffer were added to 2.9 ml of 0.1 μm bis-oxonol in assay buffer in a cuvette in the fluorimeter. Fluorescence was recorded, and the Vm was derived using the difference in intensity between the two traces, and a calibration curve was obtained by the method of Vieira et al. (11Vieira L. Slotki I. Cabantchik Z.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5299-5304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in the presence of gramicidin. For every trace where permeants or ionophores were added to cells, a similar trace was obtained in the absence of cells and subtracted as background. In addition, control traces were recorded adding assay buffer or ethanol (solvent for CCCP) instead of inhibitor. The protonmotive force (PMF) was calculated from Equation 1 (12Harold F.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 172-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).PMF=Vm−(2.3RT/F)(pHi−pHo)Equation 1 in which pHo is the extracellular pH. Intracellular measurements of ATP were determined using a bioluminescent assay, as described previously (10De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nucleosides, nucleobases, and ionophores were purchased from Sigma. [2,8,5′-3H]Adenosine (2.3 TBq/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. [3H]Inosine (1.4 TBq/mmol) was purchased from Moravek Biochemicals. [3H]H2O (925 MBq/g), [14C]sucrose (23.3 GBq/mmol),d-[1-14C]mannitol (2.11 GBq/mmol), and [3H]thymidine (3 TBq/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. BCECF and bis-oxonol were purchased from Calbiochem and Molecular Probes, respectively. Cell culture reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were analytical grade. Studies of nucleoside transport in suspended mammalian cells have utilized oil-stop methods that are capable of resolving time courses of uptake during the first few seconds of exposure of cells to permeant (13Paterson A.R.P. Harley E.R. Cass C.E. Methods Pharmacol. 1985; 6: 165-180Google Scholar). Two principal methods have been used. The first technique relies on the termination of uptake by simply centrifuging the cells through an oil layer (14Wohlhueter R.M. Marz R. Graff J.C. Plagemann P.G.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 20: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,15Harley E.R. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1289-1295PubMed Google Scholar). This process, when estimated in mammalian cells, takes approximately 2 s for the complete separation of cells from the extracellular radioactive permeant (14Wohlhueter R.M. Marz R. Graff J.C. Plagemann P.G.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 20: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Harley E.R. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1289-1295PubMed Google Scholar). This technique has been adopted by a variety of laboratories to determine initial transport rates of various molecules in parasites (5Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 16Hall S.T. Odgers G.A. Gero A.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 1993; 23: 1039-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Berger B.J. Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The second method uses the addition of excess buffer containing a transport inhibitor to block transport followed by centrifugation of cells under the oil layer (9Jarvis S.M. Hammond J.R. Paterson A.R.P. Clanachan A.S. Biochem. J. 1982; 208: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Harley E.R. Paterson A.R.P. Cass C.E. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1289-1295PubMed Google Scholar). Time courses of adenosine influx by T. brucei brucei procyclic cells using the two different stopping methods are shown in Fig. 1 A. Intervals of adenosine uptake were ended by (a) pelleting the cells under the oil layer or (b) addition of ice-cold 4 mm adenosine, followed immediately by centrifugation of cells through the oil layer. Adenosine uptake was rapid and linear for at least 20 s, and the slopes of uptake by both methods were identical. The lack of curvature in these plots would suggest initial transport rates are being measured. However, the intercept on the ordinate for the two time courses was markedly different. In the presence of 4 mm adenosine, the time course intercepted with the estimate of extracellular space. Without the addition of unlabeled adenosine, [3H]adenosine uptake appeared to continue during the centrifugation step and was equivalent to uptake over a 4-s period as evident from the intercept with the extracellular fluid of −4 s. Thus procyclic forms of T. brucei bruceitake considerably longer to pellet through the oil than the usual 2-s lag estimated for mammalian cells. In further experiments, addition of ice-cold excess permeant was used to terminate transport. Metabolism of 1 μm[3H]adenosine was monitored by TLC following an incubation period of 0, 5, and 10 s. After 5 s 7% of the recovered radioactivity was associated with adenosine with the majority of label (88%) recovered in the nucleotide fraction. After 10 s the label in the latter fraction had increased slightly to 92%. Based on the measured intracellular volume of T. brucei bruceiprocyclics (0.48 ± 0.02 μl per 107 cells; S.D.,n = 3), we calculate that the small amount of unmetabolized adenosine present did not exceed the concentration of that found extracellularly. The practical consequence of this rapid intracellular phosphorylation is that the transmembrane gradient of adenosine is maintained over the period of 10s of seconds and thus initial rates of transport in T. brucei brucei procyclics can be determined with an interval of 10 s (see Fig. 1 Aand Ref. 18Ogbunude P.O.J. Baer H.P. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Initial rates of adenosine transport were measured over the concentration range 0.05–5 μm for [3H]adenosine. Fig. 1 Bshows that adenosine influx was saturable and conformed to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km 0.19 ± 0.04 μm; Vmax 0.45 ± 0.02 pmol/107 cells s−1). The mean values from three separate experiments were 0.26 ± 0.02 μm and 0.63 ± 0.18 pmol/107 cells s−1 forKm and Vmax, respectively. The substrate specificity of adenosine transport in T. brucei brucei procyclic forms was studied by investigating the effect of a variety of compounds on the initial rates of adenosine influx. The inhibition profiles obtained with unlabeled adenosine, guanosine, and thymidine are shown in Fig. 2 A. Adenosine and guanosine totally inhibited [3H]adenosine influx in a monophasic manner with Hill slopes of 1.2 ± 0.4 and 0.94 ± 0.1, respectively. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that both nucleosides are permeants for the same carrier. The apparentKi value derived from this data for self-inhibition of adenosine influx was 0.25 ± 0.05 μm(n = 3), a value similar to the apparentKm estimate. In contrast, thymidine had no significant effect on adenosine influx by T. brucei bruceiprocyclics at concentrations up to 100 μm. In a parallel experiment, the flux of 1 μm [3H]thymidine (0.014 pmol/107 cells s−1) was determined to be 50-fold less than the corresponding rate of adenosine transport at the same concentration. The studies shown in Fig. 2 A were extended to a range of other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides. All purine nucleosides that were tested, with the notable exception of tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine), totally inhibited adenosine transport in a monophasic manner. 2′-Deoxyinosine, 2′-deoxyadenosine, inosine, and guanosine were all potent inhibitors with apparentKi values of less than 1 μm (Table I). To investigate further the kinetics of inhibition of adenosine influx, the effect of varying both the concentration of [3H]adenosine and the test nucleoside was examined. Fig. 3 shows the results of one such experiment with inosine where the data is plotted as 1/v versus I (Dixon plot). The plot is consistent with competitive inhibition and gave an apparent Ki value of 0.9 μm.Table IRank order of inhibitors of adenosine influx by procyclic T. brucei bruceiCompoundKi (μm) ± S.E.2′-Deoxyinosine0.18 ± 0.07Adenosine0.25 ± 0.052′-Deoxyadenosine0.37 ± 0.15Dipyridamole0.64 ± 0.03Inosine0.72 ± 0.11Guanosine0.94 ± 0.062-Chloroadenosine1.1 ± 0.02Formycin B1.1 ± 0.178-Azidoadenosine5.2 ± 0.07Tubercidin>100AdenineNICytidineNIHypoxanthineNIThymidineNIUracilNIUridineNINBMPRNI Open table in a new tab In contrast to the potent inhibition observed with purine nucleosides, pyrimidine nucleosides at concentrations as high as 100 μm failed to inhibit adenosine influx (Table I). Similarly, purine and pyrimidine nucleobases also had no effect on adenosine influx by T. brucei brucei. Nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) and dipyridamole, both inhibitors of the NBMPR-sensitive (es) mammalian facilitated-diffusion nucleoside carriers (13Paterson A.R.P. Harley E.R. Cass C.E. Methods Pharmacol. 1985; 6: 165-180Google Scholar, 14Wohlhueter R.M. Marz R. Graff J.C. Plagemann P.G.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 20: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 19Thorn J.A.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), had a differential effect on adenosine influx byT. brucei brucei procyclics. NBMPR had no effect on transport up to concentrations of 50 μm, approximately 50,000 times the apparent Ki value for inhibition of the es nucleoside transporter by NBMPR (13Paterson A.R.P. Harley E.R. Cass C.E. Methods Pharmacol. 1985; 6: 165-180Google Scholar, 14Wohlhueter R.M. Marz R. Graff J.C. Plagemann P.G.W.

Dipyridamole inhibited adenosine transport with a Ki of 0.64 ± 0.03 (n = 3) μm, a value several times higher than the effective concentration for inhibiting the mammalian es transporters but similar to the potency of dipyridamole to inhibit the NBMPR-insensitive (ei) nucleoside transporter in non-rat cells (13Paterson A.R.P.

Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, the Dixon plot of 1/(adenosine uptake rate) versus inosine concentration (Fig. 3) shows that inosine competitively inhibited adenosine transport with a Ki less than 1 μm. However, to demonstrate that inosine is actually transported by the adenosine carrier, the uptake of [3H]inosine in T. brucei brucei procyclics was studied. [3H]Inosine transport, at 50 nm, was rapid and linear for at least 60 s with a rate of 0.036 ± 0.003 pmol (107 cells)−1 s−1 (not shown). The concentration dependence of inosine influx was saturable and conformed to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Km 0.36 ± 0.04 μm;Vmax 0.40 ± 0.02 pmol(107cells)−1 s−1). Inosine uptake was inhibited by the purine nucleosides adenosine, guanosine, and 2′-deoxyinosine with Ki values of 0.15 ± 0.04, 0.21 ± 0.05, and 0.12 ± 0.02 μm, respectively (n = 3), but tubercidin had little effect except at high concentrations (>100 μm). Hill slopes for these inhibitors were all within 10% of −1, consistent with the presence of a single transporter. Purine bases (adenine), pyrimidine bases (uracil), and pyrimidine nucleosides (cytidine) had no effect on inosine uptake at concentrations up to 100 μm. Traces depicting the effects of adenosine, guanosine, tubercidin, and uracil on inosine transport are shown in Fig. 2 B. These results demonstrate that inosine is transported by the same carrier as adenosine. Two major classes of mammalian transporters exist as follows: equilibrative facilitated-diffusion nucleoside transporters and Na+/nucleoside cotransporters (13Paterson A.R.P. Harley E.R. Cass C.E.

To test whether adenosine uptake could be dependent on the sodium electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane, time courses of adenosine transport were compared in the presence and absence of sodium (sodium replaced by N-methyl-d-glucamine). The initial rate of adenosine influx in the presence ofN-methyl-d-glucamine was similar to that observed in the presence of sodium (92 ± 8% of the flux in the presence of Na+; mean ± S.E., n = 3) indicating a sodium-independent mechanism of transport. In many prokaryotic organisms a proton electrochemical gradient across membranes is the driving force behind the uptake of a variety of nutrients (21Harold F.M. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1977; 6: 83-149Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Craig J.E. Zhang Y. Gallagher M.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 23Okabe Y.

This gradient is composed of two components, the plasma membrane potential (Vm) and the pH gradient over the plasma membrane (ΔpH). To address whether a proton electrochemical gradient drives adenosine transport in T. brucei brucei procyclics, a series of experiments were conducted. In the first set of experiments, the proton gradient across the plasma membrane was modified by changing the extracellular pH (pHo), and the effects on adenosine transport were assessed. Consistent with a proton-driven system, a basic pHo significantly reduced adenosine uptake as compared with the control at pH 7.3 (36%,p < 0.001 at pH 8.0) (Fig. 4). However, an extracellular pH of 6.5 did not alter adenosine uptake rates (Table II). These effects of pHo on adenosine transport could be linked to similar effects on the protonmotive force (see Table II and below).Table IIEffects of ionophores, H+-ATPase inhibitors, and extracellular pH on adenosine transport and protonmotive forceInhibitor or pHoPITransportpHiVmPMFmin% controlmVmVNone1007.21 ± 0.03−86.4 ± 1.3−80.8 ± 2.2CCCP (5 μm)358 ± 4.26.93 ± 0.04−57.8 ± 3.9−36.0 ± 4.2CCCP (10 μm)341 ± 3.56.86 ± 0.06−48.9 ± 1.8−22.8 ± 3.7Nigericin (5 μm)383 ± 7.57.08 ± 0.02−77.2 ± 4.7−64.2 ± 4.9Nigericin (10 μm)370 ± 5.06.80 ± 0.05−70.0 ± 3.7−40.5 ± 4.8Nigericin (20 μm)338 ± 4.76.46 ± 0.08−78.8 ± 0.7−29.1 ± 4.8Gramicidin (1 μm)347 ± 137.33 ± 0.04−18.3 ± 5.1−20.1 ± 5.61NEM (1 mm)340 ± 5.66.48 ± 0.01−75.0 ± 3.5−26.8 ± 3.6DCCD (10 μm)396 ± 1.87.02 ± 0.04−91.0 ± 2.1−73.4 ± 3.2DCCD (100 μm)343 ± 3.66.20 ± 0.04−60.0 ± 7.9−19.8 ± 8.2pHo = 6.5594 ± 2.16.40 ± 0.03−89.8 ± 0.5−83.1 ± 1.8pHo = 8.0564 ± 1.67.12 ± 0.03−81.3 ± 3.0−29.4 ± 3.41 The effect of gramicidin on Vm may not have reached steady state levels at 3 min.

Analysis of C/EBPα mRNA and protein levels in various mammalian cells indicates that expression of this gene is controlled both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. We report here that C/EBPα translation is repressed in several cell lines by an evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF), which acts in cis to inhibit C/EBPα translation. Mutations that disrupt the uORF completely abolished translational repression of C/EBPα. The related c/ebpβ gene also contains an uORF that suppresses translation. The length of the spacer sequence between the uORF terminator and the ORF initiator codon (7 bases in allc/ebpα genes and 4 bases in c/ebpβhomologs) is precisely conserved. The effects of insertions, deletions, and base substitutions in the C/EBPα spacer showed that both the length and nucleotide sequence of the spacer are important for efficient translational repression. Our data indicate that the uORFs regulate translation of full-length C/EBPα and C/EBPβ and do not play a role in generating truncated forms of these proteins, as has been suggested by start site multiplicity models.

Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), has been a useful model for investigating the role of transcription factors in cellular differentiation. C/EBPα is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated cells such as hepatocytes and adipocytes, where it activates transcription of differentiation-specific target genes (reviewed in Refs. 2McKnight S.L. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 771-795Google Scholar and 3Johnson P. Williams S.C. Yaniv M. Tronche F. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 231-258Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrated that C/EBPα plays an essential role in the conversion of adipoblasts to mature adipocytes. For example, overexpression of C/EBPα antisense RNA in the preadipocytic cell line 3T3-F442A inhibited hormonally induced differentiation of these cells (4Samuelsson L. Stromberg K. Vikman K. Bjursell G. Enerback S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3787-3793Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, Lin and Lane (5Lin F.T. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) showed that expression of C/EBPα antisense RNA in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes prevents their conversion to adipocytes and the subsequent expression of fat-specific genes such asaP2, GLUT4, and SCD1. In the converse type of experiment, expression of an inducible C/EBPα-estrogen receptor fusion protein in 3T3-L1 adipoblasts resulted in estrogen-dependent cell growth arrest (6Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In addition, 3T3-L1 cells stably transfected with a C/EBPα expression vector exhibited reduced proliferative potential and displayed the differentiated adipocyte morphology at high frequency (7Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Forced expression of C/EBPα also promoted the adipogenic program in fibroblastic cell lines such as NIH 3T3, which normally are unable to differentiate into mature adipocytes (8Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 9Yeh W.C. Cao Z. Classon M. McKnight S.L.

Biol. 1997; 17: 1552-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that C/EBPα is a critical regulator of the adipogenic program and led to the proposal that C/EBPα plays a role in controlling the balance between cellular growth and differentiation (6Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In view of the important role of C/EBPα in cellular differentiation, the mechanisms that regulate the tissue specificity and developmental timing of C/EBPα expression are of considerable interest. Surveys of C/EBPα expression show that whereas C/EBPα transcripts are present at varying levels in many mammalian tissues and cell lines (Refs. 11Birkenmeier E.H. Gwynn B. Howard S. Jerry J. Gordon J.I. Landschulz W.H. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholarand 12Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F.

Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ovarian follicles (16Piontkewitz Y. Enerback S. Hedin L. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2327-2333Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and type II cells of the lung (17Li F. Rosenberg E. Smith C.I. Notarfrancesco K. Reisher S.R. Shuman H. Feinstein S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L241-L247PubMed Google Scholar). The disproportionate levels of C/EBPα mRNA and protein observed in certain cells indicates that post-transcriptional regulation plays a role in restricting C/EBPα expression. In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism underlying post-transcriptional control of C/EBPα expression. We demonstrate that C/EBPα translation is inhibited in transfected cell lines by a short, evolutionarily conserved upstream open reading frame (uORF) located 7 bases upstream of the C/EBPα ORF (18Calkhoven C.F. Geert A.B. Wijnholds J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). uORF-mediated repression was also observed for the related C/EBP family member C/EBPβ. The uORF repressed C/EBPα translation by acis-acting mechanism, and inhibition was overcome by mutations that inhibit translation of the uORF. Certain changes in the length and sequence of the uORF-ORF spacer region also caused translational derepression. Interestingly, we did not detect truncated C/EBPα and C/EBPβ isoforms in these experiments. These findings may necessitate a re-evaluation of models proposing that initiation at internal start sites produces truncated forms of C/EBP proteins (19Descombes P. Schibler U.

HeLa, 3T3-L1, and 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) in the presence of kanamycin, streptomycin, and penicillin. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells was performed as described previously (13Christy R.J. Yang V.W. Ntambi J.M. Geiman D.E. Landschulz W.H. Friedman A.D. Nakabeppu Y. Kelly T.J. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cultured as described (12Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). HeLa and 293 cells (30–40% confluent) were transiently transfected in 10-cm plates by a standard calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure (23Graham J.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6503) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with 7.5 μg of test plasmid, 7.5 μg of internal control plasmid, and 5 μg of carrier plasmid (pMEX) for a total of 20 μg of DNA/plate. The cells were incubated in precipitate for 18–24 h, washed twice with unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and then incubated in complete medium for an additional 18–24 h prior to harvesting. 293 cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of test plasmid, 2.5 μg of internal control plasmid, and 15 μg of pMEX plasmid. The cells were incubated in DNA precipitate for 12–15 h, washed twice with unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated in complete medium for an additional 12–15 h prior to harvesting. For the experiment of Fig. 7, 10-cm plates of HeLa cells were transfected using 2.5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of DMRIE-C reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier's recommendations. Duplicate plates were harvested after 48 h for protein and mRNA, respectively. For all transfection assays, at least two independent isolates of each recombinant plasmid were tested, and the transfections were repeated independently at least three times. For stably transfected HeLa cells, transfection conditions were identical to those described above, except that 20 μg of test plasmid were used in addition to 2.5 μg of the selectable marker (pMEX.neo). After ∼48 h, cells were split into fresh 10-cm plates and allowed to recover for an additional 48 h. Cells were then fed with complete medium supplemented with G418 (0.3–0.5 units/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.). Pools of ∼20–50 independent neor transfectants were obtained and analyzed. Plasmids used for constitutive expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were pMEX-C/EBPα and pMEX-CRP2 (hereafter denoted pMEX-C/EBPβ), respectively (12Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). C/EBPα expression plasmids containing wild-type and mutant 5′-leader regions were constructed as follows. PCR was used to introduce both a restriction site immediately upstream of the C/EBPα 5′-leader and mutations within the 5′-leader. PCR (30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 40 s and annealing/extension at 50 °C for 1 min, 20 s) was carried out using the Gene-Amp kit (Perkin-Elmer) under the conditions recommended by the supplier, except that 5% dimethyl sulfoxide was included to aid template denaturation. All PCR-derived fragments were sequenced using Sequenase T7 DNA polymerase and a 7-deaza-dGTP sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) to verify that no extraneous mutations were introduced. Wild-type and mutant 5′-leader constructs of C/EBPα were cloned using SphI (a site in the pMEX vector polylinker) at the 5′-end and NcoI, which overlaps the c/ebpα initiation codon, at the 3′-end. Oligonucleotides used to generate wild-type and mutant C/EBPα constructs were as follows: 5′-oligonucleotide for the wild type and all other mutants, 5′-GGATCCGCATGCATTCGCGACCCAAAG; wt 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGAGTTAG; uORF(ATG*) 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGAGTTAGAGTTCTCCCGGTGTGGCGAGCCTC; uORF(TAA*) 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGAGTTCGAGTTCTCCCG; ΔORF 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGAGGGCGAGCCTCGG; uORF-C/EBPα fusion 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGCGAGTTCTCCCGG; uORF Sp+10 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGGACGCCTGGGAGTTAGAGTTCTCC; uORF+Stu 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGGAGGCCTCCGAGTTAGAGTTCTCC; uORF Sp C*(−4) 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGTGAGTTAGAGTTCTCC; uORF Sp C*(−3→−5) 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGATTAGTTAGAGTTCTCC; uORF Sp+1 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGGAGTTAG; uORF Sp+2 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGGGAGTTAG; uORF Sp+3 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGGGGGAGTTAG; uORF Sp−1 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGGAGTTAG; uORF Sp−2 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGGAGTTAG; and uORF Sp−3 3′, 5′-GACTCCATGGAGTTAG. Wild-type and mutant C/EBPβ PCR products were cloned into pMEX-C/EBPβ using a SalI site in the pMEX polylinker at the 5′-end and an MscI site within the C/EBPβ open reading frame at the 3′-end. The PCR protocol described above was used to generate the wild-type and ATG2*-C/EBPβ constructs using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-oligonucleotide for both the wild type and ATG2*, 5′-GACGGCGTCGACTCCGAGCCGCGCACG; wt 3′, 5′- GTAACGTGGCCACTTCCATGGGTC; and ATG2* 3′, 5′-GTAACGTGGCCACTTCCATGGGTCTAAAGGCGGCGGGCGGCGGCGGGAGGTGTGCTGCGTC. The mutant constructs AUG1* and AUG1*/2* were made using the four-primer PCR mutagenesis procedure (24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar, 25Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6861) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides used to generate these C/EBPβ mutants were the following: ATG1* 5′: 5′-CGCGTTCACACACCGCCTG; and ATG1* 3′, 5′GGCGGTGTGTGAACGCG. For the ATG1* mutant, the first-round PCR primers were wt 5′ and ATG1* 3′ in one reaction and ATG1* 5′ and wt 3′ in another reaction. The resulting PCR products were then annealed and amplified in a second round of PCR. The ATG1*/2* mutant was generated identically to the ATG1* mutant, except that the ATG2* 3′-oligonucleotide was used in place of the wild-type 3′-oligonucleotide. The pMEX-uORF plasmid used in Fig. 5 (i.e. a C/EBPα construct containing the uORF and the 5′-leader, but lacking the C/EBPα ORF) was made by digesting wt uORF-C/EBPα withNcoI, removing most of the C/EBPα ORF. The 4.6-kilobase vector fragment was then isolated and religated to produce pMEX-uORF. The spacer +200 construct was made as follows. The uORF+Stu-C/EBPα-F construct was digested with StuI, and the linear vector fragment was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) to prevent religation. A 217-base pair fragment was obtained from an MspI digestion of the plasmid pBR322. The ends were made blunt using T4 DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and the fragment was ligated to the calf intestinal phosphatase-treated vector. Positive isolates were sequenced to identify plasmids with the insert in either orientation. FLAG-tagged constructs were generated as follows. First, the leucine zippers of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ were removed by digesting the constructs pMEX-C/EBP:GLZ and pMEX-CRP2:GLZ(26Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), in which the leucine zippers were replaced by the GCN4 zipper, with XhoI and HindIII. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the FLAG epitope was then ligated into the vector fragments. The sequence of the FLAG epitope double-stranded oligonucleotide was as follows (Sequence 1).5′­TC GAC GAG TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG TGA GGCA­3′ 3′­C CTG ATG TTC CTG CTG CTA CTG TTC ACT CCGTTCGA­5′Sequence 1 Total cellular RNA was isolated from transfected cells using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST, Inc.) or Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (15 μg) was separated by electrophoresis using formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gels and then transferred to GeneScreen membrane (DuPont) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were hybridized overnight at 42 °C with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled DNA probes. The hybridization solution consisted of 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSPE (750 mm NaCl, 50 mmNaH2PO4·H2O, and 5 mmEDTA), 1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Kruhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1995Google Scholar). Following incubation, blots were washed with 0.1% SDS and 0.5× SSPE at 65 °C and then exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). DNA probes for analysis of RNA from transfected cells by Northern blotting were prepared by isolating the following fragments: c/ebpα, 350-base pair PstI-SacI fragment from the 3′-end of the coding region of the murine c/ebpα gene; FLAG, 170-base pair XhoI-HpaI fragment from pMEX-C/EBPα-F (contains the FLAG epitope and 3′-untranslated sequences from pMEX); β-actin, 2-kilobase HindIII fragment excised from the plasmid β2000 (28Cleveland D.W.

DNA fragments were labeled to high specific activity with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It II kit (Stratagene). Whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells directly in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (30Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Leeet al. (31Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), except that Buffer A also contained 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) and 5 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), and nuclear extracts were not dialyzed against Buffer D. Nuclear extracts from tissue samples were prepared according to the method of Gorskiet al. (32Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined either by the Bio-Rad protein assay or by estimating protein following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Samples were denatured in sample buffer at 85 °C and then electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207856) Google Scholar). Molecular weights of the proteins were determined by comparison to Rainbow molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) by electroblotting. Blots were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, for 2–6 h at room temperature. Blots were incubated with primary antibody for 4–16 h at room temperature. The antigen-antibody complex was visualized using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech enhanced chemiluminescence kit. Pan-CRP antiserum was used as described (26Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The FLAG epitope was detected using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.). Fig. 1 shows a survey of C/EBPα mRNA and protein expression in several mammalian cell lines and murine tissues. C/EBPα transcript levels were highest in liver and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, two cell types in which the C/EBPα protein is abundant. HeLa and HepG2 cells and kidney tissue contained lower but significant levels of C/EBPα mRNA, whereas they lacked detectable C/EBPα protein. Liver contained 5–10-fold more C/EBPα mRNA than kidney (Fig. 1 A), but at least 20-fold more C/EBPα protein, as estimated by serial dilution of the protein extract (Fig. 1 C). The difference in protein levels is a minimum estimate since the C/EBPα signal in kidney extracts was below the level of detection. This disparity between mRNA and protein levels suggests that a post-transcriptional mechanism contributes to the regulation of C/EBPα expression. A comparison of the 5′-leaders of rat, mouse, human (34Antonson P. Xanthopoulos K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), bovine (35Taniguchi Y. Sasaki Y. J. Anim. Sci. 1996; 74: 2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), chicken, and Xenopus laevis c/ebpαgenes revealed the presence of a short (5-amino acid) conserved ORF (Fig. 2 A) (18Calkhoven C.F. Geert A.B. Wijnholds J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4093Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This uORF is located precisely 7 nucleotides upstream of the C/EBPα initiation codon in all c/ebpα homologs. The evolutionary conservation of the uORF element and its location in the transcript suggest an important function in regulating C/EBPα expression. We suspected that the uORF might suppress translation of the C/EBPα ORF since many eukaryotic mRNAs lack upstream AUG codons, and the insertion of a single functional initiation codon upstream can severely inhibit translation from downstream AUG codons (reviewed in Refs.36Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 37Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 38Pantopoulos K. Johansson H.E. Hentze M.W. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

To investigate the potential role of the uORF in regulating C/EBPα translation, we constructed rat c/ebpα genes containing either wild-type or mutant uORF sequences (Fig. 2 B) and inserted these into the eukaryotic expression vector pMEX. The mutations included alterations of the uORF initiator (ATG*) and terminator (TAA*) sequences and precise deletion of the uORF (ΔuORF). The mutant genes were tested by transient transfection into HeLa cells, a cell line in which expression of the endogenous C/EBPα protein is repressed (Fig. 1). As an internal control, each construct was cotransfected with a constitutive C/EBPβ expression vector (pMEX-C/EBPβ). Transfected cell extracts were analyzed for C/EBPα and C/EBPβ expression by Western blotting using an antibody (pan-CRP) that recognizes both C/EBP proteins (26Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C (lane 3), a gene containing optimal translation initiation signals in place of the C/EBPα 5′-leader (pMEX-C/EBPα) was expressed at high levels in HeLa cells. In contrast, a construct bearing the wild-type 5′-leader (wt uORF-C/EBPα; lane 4) produced very low amounts of C/EBPα protein. However, the mutants uORF(ATG*) (lane 5) and ΔuORF (lane 7) exhibited high levels of C/EBPα expression, comparable to pMEX-C/EBPα, whereas the uORF termination codon mutant (uORF(TAA*); lane 6) did not express C/EBPα. The same set of mutations introduced into the murinec/ebpα gene gave identical results (data not shown). These findings indicate that translation of the uORF severely inhibits C/EBPα expression in HeLa cells. To test whether translation initiates at the uORF AUG codon, we generated a construct in which the uORF was fused in frame to the C/EBPα ORF. This vector expressed high levels of a protein that was slightly larger than C/EBPα (Fig. 2 C, lane 8). The fact that the fusion protein was strongly expressed from the uORF-ORF construct demonstrates that the uORF initiation codon is utilized efficiently in HeLa cells. Accordingly, the uORF initiation codon is in a favorable context for efficient initiation (40Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3612) Google Scholar) in all species examined (Fig. 2 A). Collectively, the data of Fig. 2 C are consistent with a mechanism in which translation of the uORF cistron represses initiation from the downstream C/EBPα AUG codon. Several other eukaryotic genes are also translationally repressed by uORFs (reviewed in Ref. 37Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), including the gene encoding the Saccharomyces cerevisiae bZIP protein GCN4 (41Hinnebusch A.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To further establish that the uORF suppresses C/EBPα translation, we examined the expression of wild-type and mutant uORF constructs after stable transfection into HeLa cells. This approach enabled us to readily compare mRNA and protein expression from the engineered constructs. Because forced C/EBPα expression can cause cell growth arrest, we generated a functionally inactive protein by deleting the leucine zipper, thus preventing dimerization and DNA binding. To facilitate detection of the protein, we fused the FLAG epitope (42Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (758) Google Scholar) to the C terminus, producing a hybrid designated C/EBPα-F. The C/EBPα-F plasmids were cotransfected with a selectable marker, and pools of transfectants were selected and analyzed for C/EBPα-F mRNA and protein expression. Again, the wild-type 5′-leader was found to severely suppress C/EBPα protein expression, and mutation of the uORF AUG codon eliminated this inhibitory effect (Fig. 3). In addition, the uORF-ORF fusion gene was efficiently translated. The differences in protein levels were not due to effects on mRNA expression since similar levels of C/EBPα-F mRNA were detected in each of the transfectant pools. The results further support the conclusion that translational repression of C/EBPα in HeLa cells is controlled by the uORF and confirm that transient transfection is a valid assay for assessing C/EBPα translational control. To test whether uORF-mediated inhibition occurs in other cell types, we introduced the C/EBPα-F constructs into 293 cells (human embryonic kidney) by transient transfection. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the wild-type uORF sequence again strongly reduced C/EBPα expression. Mutations that eliminate uORF translation (uORF(ATG*) and ΔuORF; lanes 5and 7) reversed this inhibitory effect. The uORF terminator mutant, uORF(TAA*) (lane 6), was completely repressed, whereas the uORF-ORF fusion construct was efficiently translated (lane 8). Equivalent levels of C/EBPα-F transcripts were produced in each transfection (Fig. 4 B). These data corroborate the results obtained using HeLa cells and, together with similar results from HepG2 hepatoma cells (data not shown), demonstrate that uORF-dependent repression operates in a variety of cell types. We next addressed the possibility that the uORF encodes a peptide product that inhibits C/EBPα translation in trans. The uORF(ATG*) mutant was transfected into HeLa cells together with a construct that contains the uORF but lacks the C/EBPα ORF. Transfecting increasing amounts of the uORF expression plasmid did not diminish expression either from uORF(ATG*)-C/EBPα-F or from the control, pMEX-C/EBPα-F (Fig. 5). Although we cannot directly assess synthesis of the uORF-encoded peptide in the cell, the high expression seen from the uORF-ORF fusion construct (Fig. 2 C,lane 8) demonstrates that translation initiates efficiently at the uORF in HeLa cells. Thus, the inability of the uORF to repress C/EBPα translation when expressed from a separate transcript suggests that the uORF inhibits C/EBPα expression via a cis-acting mechanism. The spacing between the uORF termination codon and the C/EBPα start site is exactly 7 bases in allc/ebpα homologs characterized (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that the spacer length is an important feature for C/EBPα regulation. We examined whether mutations that increase or decrease the spacer length (Fig. 6 A) affect translational repression in 293 cells. Insertion of 1–3 cytosines in the spacer did not abolish suppression of C/EBPα translation by the uORF (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5–7). In contrast, removing a single cytosine caused a large increase in C/EBPα translation (Fig. 6 C, lane 5), and deleting 2 or 3 of the 5 cytosines preceding the ORF also resulted in significant derepression (Fig. 6 C, lanes 6 and 7). Thus, decreasing the spacing by 1 nucleotide renders the uORF unable to inhibit C/EBPα translation, demonstrating that the length and/or sequence of the spacer is critical for uORF-mediated repression. Since small increases in spacer length di"

E., Thom, E., Möhlmann, T., Steup, M., and Kampfenkel, K. (1997)Plant J. 11, 73–82). Here we have analyzed the biochemical properties of this ATP/ADP transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana (AATP1, At). This analysis was carried out by expressing a cDNA encoding this carrier as a histidine-tagged chimeric protein heterologously in Escherichia coli. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducedE. coli cells were able to import radioactively labeled [α-32P]ATP. Uninduced E. coli cells did not import [α-32P]ATP. Further control experiments revealed that IPTG induction did not promote import of other phosphorylated or unphosphorylated metabolites into the bacterial cell indicating the specificity of [α-32P]ATP transport. [α-32P]ATP uptake into induced E. colicells was linear with time for several minutes allowing for determination of kinetic constants. The apparent Km for ATP was 17 μm which is close to values reported on the authentic protein in isolated plastids. ADP was a strong competitive inhibitor of [α-32P]ATP uptake (Ki ADP 3.6 μm). Other metabolites like AMP, ADP glucose, UTP, UDP, NAD, and NADP did not influence [α-32P]ATP uptake. IPTG-induced E. colicells preloaded with [α-32P]ATP exported radioactively labeled adenylates after exogenous addition of unlabeled ATP or ADP indicating a counter exchange mechanism of transport. The biochemical properties of the heterologously expressed AATP1 gene product demonstrated that the protein is functionally integrated in the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli. This is the first report of the functional expression of a plant membrane protein in E. coli leading to new transport properties across the cytoplasmic membrane. The functional integration of a plant membrane protein in the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli offers new possibilities for future studies of the structural and mechanistic properties of this transporter. Since IPTG induction allowed synthesis of a 67-kDa protein in E. coli, which was subsequently specifically enriched by metal-chelate chromatography, this procaryotic heterologous expression system might provide a suitable system for overproduction of membrane proteins of eucaryotic origin in the near future. Recently, a second type of eucaryotic adenine nucleotide transporter located in the inner envelope membrane of higher plants has been identified at the molecular level (Neuhaus, H.

Transport of metabolic intermediates across cellular membranes is necessary for maintenance of a coordinated metabolism. In most cases this transport is mediated by membrane proteins which function either as carriers or channels. In all plant cells plastids are crucially involved in fundamental anabolic or catabolic reactions (1Emes M.J. Tobin A.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 149-216Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts, typically present in green tissues harbor the autotrophic apparatus allowing assimilation of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. Heterotrophic plant tissues contain various types of plastids which also fulfill unique functions since they are the sole location for synthesis of starch and fatty acids (1Emes M.J. Tobin A.K. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 145: 149-216Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, heterotrophic plastids contain a highly active oxidative pentose phosphate pathway allowing oxidation of imported glucose 6-phosphate and the production of C5-sugar phosphates and reduced pyridine dinucleotides (2Bowsher C.G. Boulton E.L. Rose J. Nayagam S. Emes M.J. Plant J. 1992; 2: 893-989Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Tetlow I.J. Blisset K.J. Emes M.J. Planta. 1994; 194: 454-460Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The import of ATP from the cytoplasm is essential for many of the metabolic functions carried out within plastids: in isolated heterotrophic plastids, which lack the photosynthetic machinery for ATP production, synthesis of various plant storage products strictly depend on the supply with ATP from the cytoplasm (see Refs. 4Hill L.M. Smith A.M. Planta. 1991; 185: 91-96PubMed Google Scholar, 5Neuhaus H.E. Henrichs G. Scheibe R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 6Möhlmann T. Scheibe R. Neuhaus H.E. Planta. 1994; 194: 492-497Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that even autotrophic plastids import ATP from the cytosol under specific conditions. For example, work with isolated chloroplasts from pea leaves has shown that photosynthesis is strongly stimulated when adenine nucleotides are included in the incubation medium (7Stankovic Z.S. Walker D.A. Plant Physiol. 1977; 59: 428-432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, nocturnal degradation of transitory starch in chloroplasts is substantially stimulated by the uptake of ATP (8Neuhaus H.E. Schulte N. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ATP import into all types of plastids is mediated by a specific ATP/ADP transporter (9Heldt H.W. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 5Neuhaus H.E. Henrichs G. Scheibe R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) which has been recently identified at a molecular level (10Kampfenkel K. Möhlmann T. Batz O. van Montagu M. Inzé D. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 11Neuhaus H.E. Thom E. Möhlmann T. Steup M. Kampfenkel K. Plant J. 1997; 11: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This carrier represents a second type of eucaryotic adenylate transporter that is not related to the adenylate translocator previously identified in mitochondria (for review, see Ref. 12Klingenberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The preprotein of the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter (named AATP1;ATP/ADP transportprotein 1) comprises 589 amino acids, possess a calculated molecular mass of 65 kDa, and exhibits 12 putative transmembrane domains (10Kampfenkel K. Möhlmann T. Batz O. van Montagu M. Inzé D. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of AATP1 inEscherichia coli or bakers' yeast and subsequent reconstitution of proteins in proteoliposomes demonstrated that AATP1 catalyzes ATP transport (11Neuhaus H.E. Thom E. Möhlmann T. Steup M. Kampfenkel K. Plant J. 1997; 11: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of this important type of eucaryotic ATP/ADP transporter are largely not determined. For example, the topological arrangement of AATP1 in a cellular membrane is unknown. In addition, in the near future the identification of consensus sequences of homologues to AATP1 will allow experimental attempts to analyze structure-function relationships in this type of transporter. The analysis of both, topological arrangements as well as structure-function relationships would be greatly facilitated if the expression of the AATP1gene product in E. coli leads to a functional ATP/ADP transporter in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. However, expression of highly hydrophobic proteins in E. coli is limited to a comparably few examples as most membrane proteins of heterologous origin are toxic for E. coli. Recently, a new strain of E. coli was identified that exhibits improved capacity for the overproduction of eucaryotic membrane proteins (13Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Using this strain (C43, a derivative of the E. coli strain BL21) we attempted to express the first plant membrane protein in E. coli with the aim of functional integration of this transporter in the cytoplasmic membrane. The functional expression of an ATP/ADP transporter from the Gram-negative, obligate endoparasitic bacterium Rickettsia prowazekii into the cytoplasmic membrane of E. coli has already been described (14Krause D.C. Winkler H.H. Wood D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As AATP1 from Arabidopsis thaliana and the rickettsial ATP/ADP transporter share more than 66% similarity in the amino acid sequence (10Kampfenkel K. Möhlmann T. Batz O. van Montagu M. Inzé D. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Williamson L.R. Plano G.V. Winkler H.H. Krause D.C. Wood D.O. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 80: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we analyzed whether the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter behaved in a similar manner to the bacterial protein when expressed in E. coli. For expression in E. coli strain C43 plasmid pET6, encoding the entire recombinant AATP1 protein with an additional N-terminal tag of 10 histidine residues under the control of the T7 promoter, was constructed as follows: plasmid pC23 (10Kampfenkel K. Möhlmann T. Batz O. van Montagu M. Inzé D. Neuhaus H.E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) was cleaved with NdeI at codon 77 of AATP1 and XhoI within the multiple cloning site. The resulting 1.8-kilobase 3′-fragment of the AATP1 cDNA was inserted into pET16b via NdeI and XhoI in a plasmid (pET4). A NdeI restriction site was introduced at the start codon of AATP1 (plasmid pC23) by amplification with Taq polymerase via the polymerase chain reaction using gene-specific oligonucleotides: 5′-GAGTGAAATAGAcATATGAAGCTGTGATTCAACCAG-3′ (the lowercase letter indicates the introduced base exchange to create aNdeI site), and 5′-TATTCGACCCACCAATAGAGAGACAAATGCGAGTCCC-3′ (complementary primer to AATP1, base pair positions 1100 to 1136). The polymerase chain reaction product (1.8 kilobases) was gel purified and cleaved with NdeI within the start codon and codon 77 of the AATP1 cDNA. The resulting 228-base pairNdeI fragment was purified and then inserted into pET4 cut with NdeI. The correct orientation of the 5′-NdeI fragment was subsequently verified by restriction analysis. The first 77 codons of AATP1 of the resulting plasmid pET6 were sequenced with the dideoxy chain termination method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using the T7-promoter specific primer 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG-3′ and found to be identical to the previously published cDNA sequence (10Kampfenkel K.

Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). E. coli (strain C43; kindly provided by Prof. John E. Walker, University of Cambridge, UK) cells transformed with plasmid pET6 (or plasmid pET7, see Ref. 11Neuhaus H.E. Thom E. Möhlmann T. Steup M. Kampfenkel K. Plant J. 1997; 11: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were grown in YTAmp medium until an optical density (OD,A578) of 0.6 was reached. Induction of T7 RNA polymerase was initiated by addition of IPTG (final concentration 0.012%). Cells were further grown to an OD of 1.5 and subsequently collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 5,000 × g(4 °C, Sorvall RC5B centrifuge, rotor type GSA; Sorvall-Du Pont, Dreieich, Germany). The sediments were resuspended to an OD of 1.0 using incubation medium consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2) (14Krause D.C. Winkler H.H. Wood D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and stored on ice until use. Two ml ofE. coli cells strain C43 harboring plasmid pET6 grown on the logarithmic phase were collected by centrifugation at an absorbance OD578 of 0.4 to 0.5 and subsequently suspended in 0.8 ml of a methionine assay medium containing 0.6% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.05% NaCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.4% glucose, and 0.1 mg/ml thiamine (Difco Laboratories, Heidelberg, Germany). T7 RNA polymerase synthesis was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG. After shaking the culture for 40 min at 37 °C, 20 μl of rifampicin (stock 20 mg/ml, dissolved in methanol) was added to inhibit the E. coli RNA polymerase. E. coli cells were shaken for an additional 30 min after which 170 KBq of [35S]methionine were added to label newly synthesized proteins for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were sedimented by centrifugation and transferred to liquid nitrogen to destroy cell intactness. As histidine-tagged proteins can be enriched by metal affinity chromatography we used the chelating Sepharose system by Novagen (Heidelberg, Germany). The cell sediment was resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer medium consisting of 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated on ice for 30 min. Chromatography and elution of bound proteins was carried as recommended by the supplier (Novagen). Proteins dissolved in the fractions were precipitated by adding trichloroacetic acid (20% final concentration) and incubation on ice for 30 to 45 min. Proteins were sedimented by centrifugation and washed with 500 μl of ice-cold acetone prior to SDS-PAGE to remove remaining trichloroacetic acid. For SDS-PAGE, protein sediments were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer medium and incubated on ice for 30–45 min. Subsequently, the preparation was applied to a polyacrylamide gel (3% stacking gel, 15% running gel) for electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% SDS. After drying, the gels were autoradiographed for 2 to 4 days. 100 μl of IPTG inducedE. coli cells harboring plasmid pET6 (or the given controls) were added to 100 μl of incubation medium containing radioactively labeled ATP or ADP and effectors at double concentration. α-32P-Labeled adenine nucleotides were present at specific activities between 80 and 200 μCi/mmol. [α-32P]ADP was synthesized from [α-32P]ATP (NEN, Bad Homburg, Germany). For this 2 to 4 μl of [α-32P]ATP was added into a Eppendorf reaction vessel containing 20 μl of 50 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm glucose, 1 unit of hexokinase, and 10 μm unlabeled ATP. The incubation was conducted for 60 min and hexokinase was denatured by heat inactivation (2 min at 95 °C). Under the conditions indicated, [α-32P]ATP was totally converted to [α-32P]ADP (see below). Radioactively labeled ADP was used without further purification since the radioactivity was diluted about 150-fold leading to minute contaminations of the incubation medium with glucose and glucose 6-phosphate. We determined in control experiments that these concentrations did not interfere with transport of nucleotides (data not shown). Uptake of nucleotides was carried out at 30 °C in a temperated Eppendorf reaction vessel incubator and terminated after the indicated time periods by transfer of the cells onto a 0.45-μm filter (25 mm diameter, Schleicher und Schüll, Hannover, Germany) previously prewetted with incubation medium and under vacuum (for details see: Ref. 18Winkler H.H. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were further washed to remove unimported radioactivity by addition of 2 × 1 ml of incubation medium. The filter was subsequently transferred into a 20-ml scintillation vessel containing 5 ml of water. Radioactivity in these samples was quantified in a Canberra-Packard Tricarb 2500 scintillation counter (Canberra-Packard, Frankfurt, Germany). For back-exchange experiments, IPTG induced E. coli cells were preincubated at room temperature in incubation medium containing 1 μm [α-32P]ATP (specific activity of 1 mCi/mmol; for details, see Ref. 14Krause D.C.

After 5 min, samples were diluted 1/100 with incubation medium containing AMP, ADP, or ATP (if indicated) at a concentration of 0.1 mm. To analyze the degree of enzymatic conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [α-32P]ADP and to identify the type of adenine nucleotide exported from [α-32P]ATP preloaded E. coli cells, we employed a thin-layer chromatography system according to the method of Mangold (19Mangold H.K. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Ein Laboratoriumshandbuch. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1967: 749-769Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled samples were loaded onto a 0.5-mm polyethylene amine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plate and dried with a fan. Separation was carried out for 0.5 min using 0.5m sodium formate (pH 3.4), 2 min with 2 msodium formate (pH 3.4), and the front was allowed to run for 15 cm with 4 m sodium formate (pH 3.4). RF values of radioactively labeled adenine nucleotides were determined after autoradiography and correspond to RF values of unlabeled nucleotides visualized under UV light (19Mangold H.K. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Ein Laboratoriumshandbuch. Springer, Heidelberg, Germany1967: 749-769Google Scholar). The protein content of E. coli samples was quantified using Coomassie Brilliant Blue according to the method given in Bradford (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as the protein standard. Recently, we constructed the plasmid pET7 encoding the entire AATP1 preprotein (possessing the N-terminal target peptide), expressed the cDNA in E. coli (strain WM 1576) by temperature induction, and measured adenylate uptake after reconstitution of the whole E. coli protein in proteoliposomes (11Neuhaus H.E. Thom E. Möhlmann T. Steup M. Kampfenkel K. Plant J. 1997; 11: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The intactE. coli cells of strain WM 1576 did not show ATP uptake after induction 2H. E. Neuhaus, E. Thom, and T. Möhlmann, unpublished data. which is in contrast to the heterologous expression of the rickettsial ATP/ADP transporter in E. coli (14Krause D.C. Winkler H.H. Wood D.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3015-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This discrepancy caused us to analyze whether other E. coli strains might be more useful for functional expression of AATP1 in the intact bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. For the expression of AATP1 cDNA, we used the E. coli strain C43 (kindly provided by Prof. John Walker, University of Cambridge, UK). In this strain the bacteriophage T7 polymerase promotor is induced by IPTG and thus allows protein synthesis. Expression of AATP1 cloned in plasmid pET7 leads to a slow ATP uptake rate into the intact cell of 0.04 nmol/mg of protein and 2 min, whereas uninduced cells did not show import of radioactivity. However, to use E. coli as a putative source for recombinant AATP1 protein we included an additional N-terminal histidine tag to allow subsequent purification of the protein. Interestingly, expression of this gene leads to a rate of ATP uptake into the intact E. coli cells of 0.66 nmol/mg of protein and 2 min (Table I), which is about 17 times faster than in E. coli cells harboring pET7 (see above). Expression of AATP1 cloned in plasmid pET6 allows significant higher rates of ATP import into E. coli after induction with IPTG.Table IUptake of various radioactively labeled compounds into E. coliSubstrateRate of transportE. coli controlE. coli pET6 uninducedE. coli pET6 inducednmol · mg−1protein · 2 min−1[α-32P]ATP0.0010.0020.66[14C]Glc6P1.00.81.1[14C]Glc5.05.14.8 Open table in a new tab Several control experiments were performed to gain insight into the specificity of adenylate transport across the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. As shown in Table I, uninduced E. coli cells harboring pET6 did not import ATP at substantial rates. This observation is consistent with the inability of E. colicontrol cells that lack plasmid pET6 to import [α-32P]ATP after incubation with IPTG (Table I). In contrast to stimulation of [α-32P]ATP uptake, IPTG induction of E. coli harboring pET6 does not increase rates of glucose (Glc)- or glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) import when compared with corresponding control cells (Table I). The time dependence of ATP uptake is shown in Fig. 1. The uptake of radioactively labeled ATP by IPTG induced E. coli cells harboring pET6 increased with time and the rate was linear for the first few minutes. Thereafter, ATP uptake declined progressively until after about 30 min of incubation when no substantial [α-32P]ATP uptake was detectable (Fig. 1). In contrast, uninduced cells did not import radioactively labeled ATP at significant rates (Fig. 1). To our knowledge this is the first example of a plant membrane protein that is functionally present in the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. We therefore analyzed the biochemical properties of the transporter in this heterologous system to check whether the properties of the native protein were retained. As visualized in Fig. 2 A, rising concentrations of exogenous [α-32P]ATP led to increased rates of uptake reaching an apparent saturation at a concentration of about 100 μm (Fig. 2 A). The deduced Lineweaver-Burk analysis (Fig. 2 B) allows the estimation of an apparentKm for ATP of 17 μm and aVmax of 29 nmol/mg of protein and hour. To determine the kinetic characteristics of AATP1 for [α-32P]ADP we first had to synthesize radioactively labeled ADP from [α-32P]ATP (see “Experimental Procedures”). The purity of the final product was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 3 A). It is clear from this chromatography that the conversion of ATP to ADP was essentially complete (Fig. 3 A, lane 2) and dependent upon the presence of hexokinase (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The RF values of both, ATP and ADP, respectively, are identical to those of unlabeled standards visualized under UV light (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). With [α-32P]ADP as a substrate uptake was apparently saturated at an external concentration of about 50 μm (Fig. 2). The deduced Lineweaver-Burk analysis yields an apparent Km of 12 μm and a Vmax of 80 nmol/mg of protein and hour (Fig. 2 C). The authentic ATP/ADP transporter analyzed in both, intact autotrophic or heterotrophic plastids, is relatively specific for ADP and ATP (9Heldt H.W. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,21Schünemann D. Borchert S. Flügge U.I. Heldt H.W.

J. 1997; 324: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of the heterologously expressed AATP1 present in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane was investigated by measuring the effect of various metabolic intermediates on ATP uptake (Table II). ADP exhibited the strongest inhibition on ATP import and reduced the transport rate below 6% of the control (Table II). Other metabolic intermediates like AMP, uridine nucleoside phosphates, NAD, or NADP did not substantially influence ATP uptake (Table I). As ADP is a substrate for the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter (Fig. 2, A and C) and as expected a strong inhibitor of ATP uptake (Table II) we determined the Ki of ADP on ATP uptake. From the data presented in Fig. 2 B an apparent Ki of ADP on ATP uptake of 3.6 μm was calculated (according to Ref.23Bergmeyer U. Grundlagen der Enzymatischen Analyse. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Germany1974Google Scholar).Table IIEffector of various metabolites on [α-32P]ATP uptake into IPTG induced E. coli cellsEffectorRate of transportnmol · mg−1 protein · h−1% of controlNone20.7100.0ADP1.25.8AMP17.684.3ADP-Glc17.485.3UTP18.891.1UDP22.8110.5UMP20.7100.1NAD18.589.5NADP20.599.3 Open table in a new tab Recently, it was shown that isolated maize endosperm amyloplasts import ADP-Glc and use the glucose moiety for starch biosynthesis (22Möhlmann T. Tjaden J. Henrichs G. Quick W.P. Häusler R. Neuhaus H.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To verify whether the plastidic ATP/ADP transporter might be involved in nucleotide sugar uptake we analyzed a potential inhibitory effect of ADP-Glc on ATP import. Even a 2.5-fold excess of ADP-Glc does not substantially inhibit ATP uptake into the intact bacterial cell (Table II). The plastidic ATP/ADP transporter is known to catalyze ATP movement in counter exchange to ADP (9Heldt H.W. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 21Schünemann D. Borchert S. Flügge U.I. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, export of adenylates byE. coli catalyzed by AATP1 would be dependent on the presence of the appropriate externally applied substrate if a counter exchange mechanism was maintained. To reveal whether such a counter exchange mode of transport is present we preloaded IPTG inducedE. coli cells harboring pET6 with radioactively labeled ATP for 5 min at room temperature, diluted the cells subsequently 1/100 in media containing the indicated nucleotides, and quantified the remaining radioactivity in the bacterial cells. The presence of either ADP or ATP in the dilution medium induce a rapid export of [α-32P]ATP previously present in the E. colicells (Fig. 4). This export occurred linear with time for the first minutes and progressively slowed down with incubation. Six minutes after dilution about 60% of the initial radioactivity present in the cells was exported (Fig. 4). E. coli cells preloaded with [α-32P]ATP and diluted in medium either lacking nucleotides or supplemented with AMP did not show high rates of export (Fig. 4). From the data reported in Fig. 4 it is clear that external ADP or ATP promote release of radioactivity from the intact E. colicells. However, the observation that radioactivity is exportable from the intact bacterial cell cannot be taken as proof that the compound released was indeed an adenine nucleotide. To analyze the chemical nature of the radioactivity released we separated the radioactively labeled compounds by thin-layer chromatography. For this purpose we preloaded the cells as above with [α-32P]ATP and removed unincorporated radioactivity by two washes with ice-cold incubation medium. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in incubation medium containing unlabeled ATP or ADP and incubated for 6 min at room temperature. The cells were then sedimented for 2 min in a precooled (4 °C) Eppendorf centrifuge, the supernatant was then transferred to new reaction vessels and heated to 95 °C for 1 min to prevent any further reaction. An aliquot of this solution was used for separation by thin-layer chromatography. The radioactive components exported after addition of ATP (Fig. 3 B, lane 1) or ADP (Fig. 3 B, lane 2), respectively, exhibit the same radioactive pattern. The RF values of the two spots in each lane are identical to unlabeled ATP and ADP. A small amount of radioactivity appears as a third compound of unknown nature that is distinct from ATP or ADP. We verified that this third compound is not AMP (data not shown) (Fig. 3 B). However, from the data presented it can be concluded that at least 80"
https://openalex.org/W2042929656,"Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE) is a component of the TOL plasmid-encoded pathway for the degradation of toluene and xylenes and catalyzes the dioxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring. Purified XylE is oxygen-sensitive and unstable in vitro, particularly in the presence of substituted catechol substrates, but it is stabilized in vivo by another protein, XylT, encoded by the xylT gene located just upstream of xylE. In this study, we have purified to homogeneity the XylT product from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing a hyperexpressible xylT gene and characterized it as a novel [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. It is the first example of a soluble ferredoxin with a net positive charge at neutral pH. The EPR signal of the iron sulfur cluster has rhombic symmetry as is the case for plant-type ferredoxins, but the XylT absorbance spectrum resembles more closely that of adrenodoxin. The midpoint redox potential was determined to be −373 ± 6 mV, at pH 8.5. XylT was unusually unstable for a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin, with half-lives of 69 min at 25 °C in air and 70 min at 37 °C in argon. With photochemically reduced 5-deazaflavin for the controlled generation of reductant, it was demonstrated that XylT mediates the rapid reactivation of purified inactive catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in vitro. Inactivation of XylE by 4-methylcatechol resulted in oxidation of the active site iron to a high spin ferric state that was detectable by EPR. Spectroscopic evidence presented here demonstrates that XylT reactivates XylE through reduction of the iron atom in the active site of the enzyme. It is the first instance of a ferredoxin-mediated reactivation of an enzyme. The level of expression of XylT in Pseudomonas putida mt2 cells is low and the calculated XylT/XylE molar ratio is consistent with the proposal that XylE reactivation involves catalytic nonstoichiometric amounts of XylT. Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (XylE) is a component of the TOL plasmid-encoded pathway for the degradation of toluene and xylenes and catalyzes the dioxygenolytic cleavage of the aromatic ring.

The level of expression of XylT in Pseudomonas putida mt2 cells is low and the calculated XylT/XylE molar ratio is consistent with the proposal that XylE reactivation involves catalytic nonstoichiometric amounts of XylT. Pseudomonas putida mt2 carries the TOL plasmid pWW0, which encodes a set of enzymes responsible for the transformation of toluene and xylene to central pathway intermediates (1Worsey M.J. William P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catabolic (xyl) genes are organized in two operons, the so-called upper and meta-operons. The enzymes encoded by the upper operon catalyze the sequential oxidation of toluene to benzoate, whereas the enzymes of the meta-operon convert benzoate to Krebs cycle intermediates (2Harayama S. Leppick R.A. Rekik M. Mermod N. Lehrbach P.R. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the meta-pathway, the enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase encoded by xylE catalyzes the extradiol cleavage of the aromatic ring. This reaction has been studied in detail, and a general mechanism for the oxidative cleavage of catechol by extradiol dioxygenases has been proposed (3Shu L. Chiou Y.M. Orville A.M. Miller M.A. Lipscomb J.D. Que Jr., L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The two atoms of the oxygen molecule are incorporated in the catechol substrate on two adjacent carbon atoms of the aromatic ring, one of which already carries a hydroxyl substituent of the diol and the other of which is unsubstituted. At the active site, the enzyme possesses a single iron atom that binds the substrate and oxygen and participates in the catalytic cycle. Structural determination of the related biphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase revealed that the iron atom is bound to the polypeptide through covalent linkages with the side chains of three residues, histidines 146 and 210 and aspartate 260 (4Han S. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.N. Muchmore S.W. Bolin J.T. Science. 1995; 270: 976-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), residues that are conserved among extradiol dioxygenases (5Eltis L.D. Bolin J.T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5930-5937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the active enzyme, the iron atom is in the ferrous state and is assumed to stay reduced throughout the catalytic cycle. However, in the presence of certain substrates, such as 4-methylcatechol and chlorocatechols, oxidation of the iron atom occurs, accompanied by inactivation of the enzyme (6Bartels I. Knackmuss H.J. Reineke W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 500-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Slow but significant inactivation also takes place during enzyme turnover with catechol as substrate (7Cerdan P. Rekik M. Harayama S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Polissi and Harayama (8Polissi A. Harayama S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) found that a mechanism exists in vivo that hinders irreversible inactivation of catechol dioxygenase. Mutants lacking a functional xylT gene lost the ability to grow on p-xylene and p-toluate as carbon sources. In addition, it was found that 4-methylcatechol, which is an intermediate in the degradation ofp-xylene and p-toluate, irreversibly inactivated catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in the xylT mutants, while the enzyme remained active in wild-type P. putida. It was therefore envisioned that the xylT gene product might participate in a mechanism of protection or reactivation of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (8Polissi A. Harayama S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3339-3347Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The xylT gene lies immediately upstream of xylE, and its sequence suggests that it may code for a ferredoxin (9Harayama S. Polissi A. Rekik M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we have purified the xylT gene product and tested whether it can reactivate catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in vitro. The xylT gene was hyperexpressed inEscherichia coli yielding a red protein that was purified and characterized as a novel [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. An experimental system was developed to monitor XylT-dependent reactivation of the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. It was demonstrated that XylT alone can reactivate catechol 2,3-dioxygenase in a reaction that is rapid and specific and requires reductant. The low amount of XylT detected in wild-type P. putida cells suggests that it acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. E. colistrain DH5α (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as a host for general DNA manipulations, as well as for xylE hypererexpression. Strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) was employed for hyperexpression of the xylT gene. Cultures were grown on LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. For XylT hyperproduction, cultures were grown at 28 °C in 10-liter fermentors supplemented with 50 μm FeSO4. For XylE production, E. coli, DH5α (pAW31) (10Wasserfallen, A., Biochemical and Genetical Study of the Specificity of Catechol 2,3-Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida.Ph.D. thesis, 1989, University of Geneva.Google Scholar), was grown overnight at 37 °C in 2-liter flasks containing 0.8 liter of culture. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then stored at −20 °C. P. putida strains mt2 (1Worsey M.J. William P.A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 7-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and KT 2442 (11Franklin F.C. Bagdasarian M. Bagdasarian M.M. Timmis K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7458-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) were grown on minimal M9 medium supplemented with 5 mm benzoate as sole carbon source. Cultures were incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm in a rotary shaker. ThexylT gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction usingTaq polymerase (Promega), plasmid pAW31 (10Wasserfallen, A., Biochemical and Genetical Study of the Specificity of Catechol 2,3-Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida.Ph.D. thesis, 1989, University of Geneva.Google Scholar), as a template and the following primers: AJ021, 5′-cgggcatATGAACAGTGCCGGCTACG-3′; AJ022, 5′-gcgcggatcCTCATGACGTCACCTCTTC-3′. NdeI and BamHI sites were included in these primers to facilitate subsequent cloning into the expression plasmid. A fragment of the expected size was purified and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to give plasmid pAJ90. The xylT insert was checked by DNA sequencing (12Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) and then subcloned into pET9a (Novagen). The resulting plasmid called pAJ91 was introduced into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Induction of xylT expression was initiated with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside when the bacterial density reached anA600 of 1.8. Bacteria were harvested 6 h later. The purification procedure was performed at 4 °C under argon using Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, containing 2 mm dithionite. Bacterial cells from 20 liters of culture were resuspended in 120 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, containing 5 mm EDTA and subjected to lyzozyme treatment (0.2 mg/ml) for 15 min. The bacterial extract was sonicated three times for 30 s and then diluted to 190 ml with buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 units/ml benzonase (Merck). Ammonium sulfate was then added to 1 m final concentration, and the protein extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 min. The supernatant fraction was applied to a 30-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) preequilibrated with 1 m ammonium sulfate in Tris buffer. A red-brown protein remained bound on top of the column. After extensive washing with buffered 1 m ammonium sulfate, the red protein was eluted with Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and then diluted 10-fold in this buffer and passed through a 40-ml column of DEAE-cellulose (DE52, Whatman). The unbound protein fraction containing XylT was adjusted to 1 m ammonium sulfate and then applied to a 15-ml column of phenyl-Sepharose. The XylT fraction was eluted in a small volume of Tris buffer and then loaded on a gel filtration column (AcA 54, Biosepra), Ø = 2.5 × 110 cm, equilibrated with Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The column was developed at a flow rate of 20 ml/h. The XylT fraction was concentrated to approximately 8 ml by ultrafiltration through an 8-kDa Omega membrane (Pall Filtron). XylT was stored as pellets in liquid nitrogen. Bacterial cells were rinsed with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10% isopropyl alcohol (v/v) and 1 mm EDTA (hereafter referred to as buffer A). Cells were broken by sonication as described for XylT purification, and the resulting preparation was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 ×g. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 40-ml DEAE-cellulose column (DE52), which was sequentially developed by solutions of buffer A containing NaCl at increasing concentrations from 0.1 to 0.4 m (0.1 m increments). Dioxygenase activity was recovered in fractions eluting between 0.3 and 0.4m NaCl. These fractions were pooled and adjusted to 1m ammonium sulfate and then applied to a 40-ml phenyl-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was developed with a linear gradient from 1 to 0 m ammonium sulfate in buffer A. Active fractions were loaded on a 25-ml column of Q-hyper D (Biosepra), which was developed with a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl. XylE eluted at approximately 0.6 mNaCl. It was concentrated by ultrafiltration through a 30-kDa Omega membrane and stored in liquid nitrogen. The purified preparations thus obtained exhibited specific activities of between 125 and 175 units/mg. An antiserum was raised in rabbits against purified recombinant XylT. XylT-specific IgG antibodies were purified from the antiserum by immunoaffinity according to a previously published procedure (13Armengaud J. Meyer C. Jouanneau Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, XylT (0.3 mg in SDS mixture) was adsorbed onto pieces of nitrocellulose membrane (7 cm2). After washing, the XylT-coated membrane was incubated with 0.5 ml of antiserum for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, antibodies were eluted from the membrane by a solution of 5 mm glycine-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 2.3, and the eluate was immediately neutralized. The antibody preparation was used in Western blot analysis at a 1:250 dilution. Anti-XylT IgG was also immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (Sigma). A sample equivalent to 0.15 ml of packed resin was incubated with 0.4 ml of antiserum in two Spin-X centrifuge filter units (Costar) for 1 h at room temperature under constant agitation. The resin was washed three times with 0.5 ml of 0.2m sodium borate, pH 9. Bound IgG antibodies were cross-linked to protein A by incubation for 30 min with 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma) in 0.5 ml of borate buffer. The resin was washed and incubated for 2 h in 0.2 methanolamine, pH 8.0, and finally stored in 10 mmphosphate, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 7.4. P. putida cultures (200 ml) in midlog phase (A600 ranging between 1.0 and 1.5) were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Bacterial pellets were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm potassium phosphate containing 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Bacteria were disrupted by ultrasonication for 2 min on ice. The crude extracts were then centrifuged for 30 min at 220,000 ×g in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Samples of the high speed supernatant fractions, equivalent to 3.4 mg of protein, were incubated with immobilized anti-XylT IgG (20 or 40 μl) in a total volume of 0.3 ml. Incubation was carried out for 1 h at 4 °C in Spin-X centrifuge filter units (Costar) maintained under constant agitation (Eppendorf thermomixer). The beads of immobilized IgG-Sepharose were washed three times with 0.5 ml of 10 mmpotassium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5. Bound proteins were then eluted by treatment for 5 min at 95 °C in 25 μl of SDS mixture. Samples of the eluted proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 16% polyacrylamide gel containing 13% glycerol in a Tris-Tricine 1The abbreviations used are: Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. buffer system (14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Proteins were electroblotted on a nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (15Jouanneau Y. Meyer C. Naud I. Klipp W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), which was then developed with purified anti-XylT IgG (1:250 dilution) and a goat anti-rabbit peroxidase conjugate (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma) as primary and secondary antibodies, respectively. The blot was revealed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). UV-visible absorption spectrophotometry, EPR spectroscopy, and estimation of protein-bound iron were performed as described previously (16Jouanneau Y. Meyer C. Gaillard J. Forest E. Gagnon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10636-10644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For preparation of the nitrosyl complex of the dioxygenase, enzyme samples were made anaerobic under an argon phase, transferred into EPR tubes, and slowly bubbled with NO gas for 3 min. Proteins were analyzed by slab gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (SDS-PAGE) according to Jouanneau et al. (13Armengaud J. Meyer C. Jouanneau Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3304-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). XylE activity was assayed as described by Nozaki et al.(14Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10–50-μl samples were mixed in a cuvette containing 3 ml of 0.330 mm catechol in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5. The increase in absorption at 375 nm was recorded over 30 s using an HP8452 spectrophotometer. Redox titration of XyT was performed spectrophotometrically using 5-deazaflavin as a photoreductant and benzyl-viologen as a dye indicator (E′0 = −320 mV versus normal hydrogen electrode). Spectrophotometric measurements were made at 25 °C inside a glove box (Jacomex) containing argon purified to less than 1 ppm O2 (15Jouanneau Y. Meyer C. Naud I. Klipp W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A 1-cm light path cuvette contained, in a 820-μl volume, 5 μm 5-deazaflavin, 15 mmsodium oxalate, 50 μm benzyl-viologen, and 27 μm XylT in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The mixture was exposed to the light of a slide projector for short intervals of time (5–60 s), and absorbance changes were monitored after 30-s equilibration in darkness. The percentage of XylT reduction was determined from absorbance readings at 440 nm (an isosbestic point between the oxidized and reduced forms of benzyl-viologen), using ε440 (ox) = 8.60 mm−1·cm−1 and ε440 (red)= 4.885 mm−1·cm−1 for the oxidized and reduced forms of XylT, respectively. The extent of benzyl-viologen reduction was calculated from the absorption at 600 nm after correction for the absorption of ferredoxin at this wavelength: ε600(ox) = 3.51 mm−1·cm−1, and ε600 (red) = 2.69 mm−1·cm−1 for the oxidized and reduced forms of XylT, respectively. The conditions of inactivation were adapted from Bartels et al. (6Bartels I. Knackmuss H.J. Reineke W. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 500-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Wasserfallen (10Wasserfallen, A., Biochemical and Genetical Study of the Specificity of Catechol 2,3-Dioxygenase from Pseudomonas putida.Ph.D. thesis, 1989, University of Geneva.Google Scholar). Catechol 2,3-dioxygenase was diluted to 50 nm in a total volume of 500 μl of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1% isopropyl alcohol and incubated with 400 μm 4-methylcatechol for 30 min at room temperature. In control experiments, an equivalent amount of enzyme was treated similarly, except that 4-methylcatechol was omitted. After extensive dialysis twice against 1000 volumes of 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 10% isopropyl alcohol, the enzyme samples were made anaerobic in 4-ml glass vials and kept under argon during reactivation. Chemical reactivation of XylE was carried out in the presence of 1 mm ferrous iron and 1 mm cysteine (17Nozaki M. Ono K. Nakazawa T. Kotani S. Hayashi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 2682-2690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). XylT-dependent reactivation was performed under argon in 4-ml vials containing 50 nm inactivated XylE, 2 μm 5-deazaflavin, 1 mm glycine, 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and a variable concentration of XylT in a final volume of 200 μl. Reaction vials were kept at 20 °C in a thermostatted water bath and were illuminated by the light of a slide projector for defined time periods. After light exposure, the samples were allowed to equilibrate for 30 s in the dark before measuring XylE activity. Assays were done in triplicate on 10 μl of reaction mixture. Ferredoxins other than XylT were tested under the same conditions. For EPR measurements, XylE was inactivated with 100 mm or 200 mm 4-methylcatechol, dialyzed extensively, and then concentrated to a final concentration ranging from 105 to 126 μm. Part of the preparation was subjected to reactivation for 5–10 min in the light in the presence of 10 mmglycine, 2.5 μm 5-deazaflavin, and XylT, as indicated. Another part, used as a control, was incubated under identical conditions except that XylT was omitted. To facilitate isolation of the xylT gene product, its coding sequence was cloned in the expression vector pET9a under the transcriptional control of the strong T7 promoter. While verifying the DNA sequence of xylT, we found the first two bases of codon 76 to be inverted compared with the previously reported sequence (GC instead of CG) (9Harayama S. Polissi A. Rekik M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This inversion would result in an alanine-to-glycine change in the deduced polypeptide sequence. We observed the same difference upon sequencing the xylT region of plasmid pAW31. The new xylT sequence resembles more closely those of four homologous genes currently in the EMBL/DDBJ/GenBankTM data base. Expression of xylT in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) gave rise to the production of a polypeptide of the expected size (approximately 15 kDa) that was visualized as a prominent band by SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell lysates. Since the xylT gene product contains a potential binding site for a [2Fe-2S] cluster (9Harayama S. Polissi A. Rekik M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we expected the recombinant protein to be red-brown like ferredoxins containing this type of cluster. However, the protein extract prepared from E. coli hyperexpressing xylT at 37 °C was hardly colored. This suggested that the recombinant protein accumulated essentially in the apoform in E. coli. Induction ofxylT expression at 28 °C results in the formation of a greater amount of the recombinant protein as the holoform. This was confirmed by EPR measurements of the signal produced by the Fe-S center of recombinant XylT (see below) made directly on dithionite-reduced crude extracts of E. coli. The signal intensity was approximately 4-fold greater with extracts from cells grown at 28 °C than with cells grown at 37 °C, whereas a control extract from uninduced E. coli gave a negligible signal. Hyperexpression of xylT was therefore carried out at 28 °C. Due to the instability of the recombinant protein in air (see below), purification was performed under strict anaerobiosis. The xylT gene product could be purified to near homogeneity by the three-step procedure illustrated in Fig. 1. An average of 1.0 mg of purified XylT was recovered per liter of culture with a yield close to 10%. The purified XylT protein migrated as a single band on SDS-PAGE with an apparentMr of 15,000 (Fig. 1). N-terminal sequence analysis clearly identified this protein band as the xylTgene product and showed that the initial methionine was not removed inE. coli. The expected molecular mass of the XylT polypeptide as deduced from its polynucleotide sequence is 12,034 Da. The molecular mass of the native XylT protein estimated by gel filtration was about 12 kDa, indicating that it is monomeric. The XylT polypeptide is characterized by a predominance of basic over acidic residues (9Harayama S. Polissi A. Rekik M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 285: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and has a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.27 (Table I). Although this value was not confirmed experimentally, the basic character of XylT was consistent with its lack of binding to DEAE-cellulose in the 7–9 pH range and its retention on a strong anion exchange column only at pH 9.0 (Fig. 1,lane 2). The XylT protein is relatively unstable due to its sensitivity to oxygen and temperature. The protein denatures when exposed to air, resulting in both a loss of its absorbance in the visible region and its precipitation. From the decrease in its absorption at 416 nm, which followed first order kinetics, the half-life of XylT in air was estimated to be 69 min at ambient temperature. Based on the same criterion, XylT appeared to be unstable at 37 °C (Table I), consistent with the finding that it was mainly present in apoform in E. coli grown at this temperature.Table IMolecular properties of XylTParameterValueMolecular mass By gel filtration (Mr)12,000 By SDS-PAGE (Mr)15,000 From the sequence12,034 DaIsoelectric point (theoretical)8.27Iron content (Fe atom/mol)1.88 ± 0.13Midpoint redox potential−373 ± 6 mVAbsorption coefficient A416 (oxidized)9.52 mm−1 · cm−1 A276 (oxidized)12.5 mm−1 · cm−1Stability1-aExpressed as half-life (min) under given conditions.

Values were calculated from the kinetics of the absorbance decrease at 416 nm. Open table in a new tab The UV-visible absorption spectra of the oxidized and reduced forms of XylT are presented in Fig. 2. Protein purified under reducing conditions spontaneously oxidized upon removal of dithionite by anaerobic gel filtration, probably because of residual oxygen present in the argon (approximately 200 ppm). The spectrum of oxidized XylT exhibited three maxima due to the chromophore at 336, 416, and 456 nm, as well as a shoulder near 540 nm. The absorption of the polypeptide at 278 nm is not very pronounced, consistent with the absence of tryptophan and the low content of aromatic residues in XylT sequence. Upon reduction, a general decrease of the absorption in the visible region occurred, and a peak appeared at 540 nm (Fig. 2). Based on protein determination using the BCA assay, and given the molecular mass of XylT (12 kDa), the absorption coefficient of the oxidized form was calculated to be 9.52 mm−1·cm−1at 416 nm. All of these properties are similar to those of other [2Fe-2S] ferredoxins (18Cammack R. Nature. 1980; 286: 442Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Determination of the iron content of XylT indicates the presence of one [2Fe-2S] cluster per polypeptide chain (Table I). EPR analysis of purified XylT in the reduced form gave a signal centered at g = 1.94 with general rhombic symmetry that was detectable at temperatures at least as high as 40 K. This signal may be attributed to a [2Fe-2S] cluster with an S = ½ spin state (Fig. 3). Double integration of the EPR signal of spectrum II in Fig. 3 and comparison with a standard, i.e. the [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from Rhodobacter capsulatus (19Grabau C. Schatt E. Jouanneau Y. Vignais P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3294-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gave a value of about 0.9 spin/mol of protein, thus providing further evidence that XylT contains one [2Fe-2S] cluster. The line shape of the EPR signal was, however, unusual for this type of cluster in that the resonance lines were relatively broad, and, as a consequence, the gx component of the tensor was not well resolved (Fig. 3, spectrum II). The broadening might reflect some microheterogeneity of the protein preparation in the vicinity of the Fe-S cluster. Considering the relative instability of XylT, the question arose whether the anomalies detected by EPR spectroscopy resulted from conformational changes in the protein during the purification. This hypothesis was assessed by recording EPR spectra in the E. coli soluble extract (Fig. 3, spectrum I) as well as at the subsequent steps of the purification (data not shown). The signal observed did show small differences compared with that of purified XylT (Fig. 3, spectrum II), indicating that XylT may have undergone minor changes during isolation. The EPR spectrum of the protein in the cell extract (Fig. 3, spectrum I) exhibited a greater apparent complexity, which was primarily due to the contribution of E. coli proteins. Interestingly, the addition of glycerol to purified XylT protein before freezing the EPR tube caused a significant change in the high field region of the spectrum (Fig. 3, spectrum III), reflecting a more pronounced rhombic symmetry with gx,y,z = 1.88, 1.94, and 2.04. Hence, the EPR data give clear evidence that XylT can adopt at least two slightly different conformations at low temperature. It is unknown whether the heterogeneity detected in the frozen XylT sample reflects that of a sample at ambient temperature. The addition of glycerol to XylT had no detectable effect on the absorbance spectrum of the oxidized form. It is nevertheless plausible that the two signals detected by EPR with purified XylT (Fig. 3, spectra II and III) correspond to two conformations that could have been trapped upon freezing. These properties seem to denote an unusual flexibility of the protein around the cluster binding site. To further characterize the [2Fe-2S] cluster of XylT, its redox potential was determined by spectrophotometric titration using benzyl-viologen as potential indicator. The calculated midpoint redox potential was −373 ± 6 mV at pH 8.5 and 25"
https://openalex.org/W2076132501,"The mechanisms by which HMG-I proteins regulate cell growth are unknown, and their effects on gene expression have only been partially elucidated. We explored the potential interaction between HMG-I proteins and serum-response factor (SRF), a member of the MADS-box family of transcription factors. In cotransfection experiments, HMG-I(Y) potentiated SRF-dependent activation (by more than 5-fold) of two distinct SRF-responsive promoters, c-fos and the smooth muscle-specific gene SM22α. This effect was also observed with a heterologous promoter containing multiple copies of the CC(A/T)6GG (CArG) box. HMG-I proteins bound specifically to the CArG boxes of c-fos and SM22α in gel mobility shift analysis and enhanced binding of SRF to these CArG boxes. By chelating peptide-immobilized metal affinity chromatography, we mapped the domain of HMG-I(Y) that interacts with SRF to amino acids 50–81, a region that does not bind specifically to DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays even though it includes the third AT-hook DNA-binding domain. Surprisingly, HMG-I(Y) mutants that failed to bind DNA still enhanced SRF binding to DNA and SRF-dependent transcription. In contrast, deletion of the HMG-I(Y) 50–81 domain that bound SRF prevented enhancement of transcription. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an HMG-I protein interacting with a MADS-box transcription factor. Our observations suggest that members of the HMG-I family play an important role in SRF-dependent transcription and that their effect is mediated primarily by a protein-protein interaction.

Serum-response factor (SRF), 1The abbreviations used are: SRF, serum-response factor; CArG box, the sequence CC(A/T)6GG; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CP-IMAC, chelating peptide-immobilized metal affinity chromatography; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. a member of the MADS-box family of transcription factors, activates a variety of genes through binding to the sequence CC(A/T)6GG (the CArG box). SRF is also an important integrator of intracellular signal transduction pathways through its interaction with accessory factors (members of the ets, homeodomain, and zinc finger families) (1Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). SRF activates transcription in genes of two classes: muscle-specific genes (3Boxer L.M. Prywes R. Roeder R.G. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 4Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Shimizu R.T.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), of which c-fos is the prototype. Architectural transcription factors of the HMG-I family are important in gene expression and growth regulation (6Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are currently three members: HMG-I, HMG-Y, and HMGI-C. HMG-I (107 amino acids) and HMG-Y (96 amino acids) derive from alternatively spliced transcripts of the same gene. Because their biological properties are indistinguishable, they are referred to as HMG-I(Y). HMGI-C is related to them structurally but derives from a distinct gene. The HMG-I transcription factors bind broadly to AT-rich DNA in the minor groove through the AT-hook peptide motif (7Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although HMG-I proteins have no intrinsic ability to activate transcription, they regulate the affinity and activity of other transcription factors by altering local chromatin structure. The best example of a regulatory region responsive to HMG-I(Y) is the β-interferon promoter. HMG-I(Y) binds to the PRDII element of the promoter and recruits the transcription factor NF-κB (8Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1992; 71: 777-789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y) also binds the PRDIV element of the promoter and recruits ATF-2/c-Jun, producing synergy between the PRDII and PRDIV elements (9Du W. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11318-11322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In the absence of HMG-I(Y) binding, neither NF-κB nor ATF-2 confers viral inducibility on this promoter. HMG-I(Y) seems to enhance β-interferon transcription by facilitating formation of a stereospecific complex referred to as an enhanceosome (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 11Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), which reverses an intrinsic bend in the DNA (12Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Other examples of HMG-I(Y)-responsive genes include the endothelial cell adhesion molecule E-selectin (13Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the chemokine MGSA/GROα (14Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the IgE locus (15Wang D.Z. Ray P. Boothby M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22924-22932Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the case of the IgE promoter, HMG-I(Y) represses basal transcription until it is phosphorylated by an interleukin 4-dependent pathway, which decreases its affinity for DNA in vitro. Thus, HMG-I(Y) can be a positive and a negative regulator of transcription. Recently, HMG-I(Y) has been shown to repress the T cell-receptor gene enhancer by influencing DNA topology (16Bagga R. Emerson B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). HMG-I proteins are thought to play critical roles in cell growth and transformation. They are expressed at low or undetectable levels in adult tissues but are expressed highly in embryonic and neoplastic tissues (17Giancotti V. Pani B. D'Andrea P. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Philip R. Crane-Robinson C. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Goodwin G.H. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 18Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are many data in support of a causal role for HMGI-C in cell growth and transformation. Overexpression of HMGI-C antisense RNA prevents retrovirally induced transformation (19Berlingieri M.T. Manfioletti G. Santoro M. Bandiera A. Visconti R. Giancotti V. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Also, the HMGI-C gene on human chromosome 12q15 is often rearranged in benign mesenchymal tumors (20Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 21Schoenmakers E.F. Wanschura S. Mols R. Bullerdiek J. Van den Berghe H. Van de Ven W.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Analysis of some of the chimeric transcripts resulting from these rearrangements shows that the AT-hook DNA-binding motifs are fused with a LIM domain in one case and an acidic transcriptional activator domain in another (20Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). These chimeric transcripts probably contribute significantly to the pathobiology of mesenchymal tumor formation. In addition, targeted disruption of the HMGI-C gene in mice results in a pygmy phenotype (22Zhou X. Benson K.F. Ashar H.R. Chada K. Nature. 1995; 376: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Although these animals develop normally, all their organs are small. Cultured embryonic fibroblasts from the pygmy mice grow much more slowly than wild-type cells, perhaps because the disruption of the HMGI-C gene leads to decreased cellular proliferation and premature differentiation. Because the HMGI-C gene is homologous to the HMG-I(Y) gene, which has been localized to another locus often rearranged in benign tumors, human chromosome 6p21 (23Friedmann M. Holth L.T. Zoghbi H.Y. Reeves R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), a similar role in growth regulation has been proposed for HMG-I(Y) (20Ashar H.R. Fejzo M.S. Tkachenko A. Zhou X. Fletcher J.A. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Chada K. Cell. 1995; 82: 57-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 21Schoenmakers E.F. Wanschura S. Mols R. Bullerdiek J. Van den Berghe H. Van de Ven W.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 436-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the HMG-I proteins alter growth is not known but presumably involves activation and repression of specific genes. We have found that the HMG-I proteins are induced dramatically in proliferating vascular smooth muscle. 2M. T. Chin and M.-E. Lee, manuscript in preparation. Because the role of SRF in cell proliferation and expression of vascular smooth muscle-specific genes is well established, and its DNA-binding element (the CArG box) is rich in adenine and thymine residues, we hypothesized that HMG-I proteins may bind to the CArG box and affect the ability of SRF to bind to DNA and activate transcription. We show in this report that HMG-I(Y) enhances SRF-dependent activation of the c-fos and SM22α promoters in eukaryotic cells, an effect that is also observed for a heterologous promoter containing a CArG box. HMG-I(Y) binds specifically to the CArG box and enhances binding of SRF in vitro, and the SRF-interacting domain maps to HMG-I(Y) amino acids 50–81. Surprisingly, mutations that interfere with DNA binding by HMG-I(Y) but preserve its interaction with SRF retain the ability to enhance binding of SRF to DNA in vitro and augment SRF-dependent transcription in vivo. Using rat genomic DNA as a template, we cloned the rat SM22α promoter by amplifying nucleotides −1507 to +32 by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR fragment was then inserted into the XhoI site of pGL2-Basic (Promega). Nucleotides −711 to +97 of the human c-fos promoter were amplified by PCR from pF4 (24Treisman R. Cell. 1985; 42: 889-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and inserted into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pGL2-Basic. A DNA fragment containing a single copy of the proximal SM22α CArG box (5′AATTCACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGGAGTGGTCGA-3′) was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of the yeast reporter vector pLacZi (CLONTECH). A yeast reporter plasmid containing three copies of the CArG box (pCArG3LacZi) was constructed from pCArGLacZi by cloning two additional copies of a DNA fragment encoding the SM22α CArG box (5′-AATTCACTTGGTGTCTTTCCCCAAATATGGAGCCTGTGTGGAGTAATT-3′) into the EcoRI site by standard methods (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The Drosophila expression plasmids pPAC, pPACHMGI, and phsp82LacZ have been described (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). The SRF expression construct forDrosophila cells was made by inserting the human cDNA (26Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The SRF construct forin vitro transcription and translation was made by cloning the full-length cDNA into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The yeast expression clone for HMGI-C was made by inserting the full-length mouse cDNA (28Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Sautiere P. Cary P. Crane-Robinson C. Coles B.

Similarly, the mouse HMG-I(Y) cDNA (18Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol.

The yeast expression clone for SRF was made by inserting the human cDNA into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the galactose-inducible vector pJG4–5 (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The prokaryotic expression clone for mouse HMG-I(Y) was obtained by PCR amplification of nucleotides 202 to 492, containing the entire coding sequence and stop codon with an EcoRI site added at each end, by using the oligonucleotides 5′-GAATTCATGAGCGAGTCGGGCTCAAA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCACTGCTCCTCCTCAGAGGA-3′. This insert was then cloned into the EcoRI site of pRSET B (Invitrogen). The prokaryotic expression vector for SRF was made by cloning the human cDNA into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pRSET C. The HMG-I(Y)1–81 carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of nucleotides 202 to 444 with the addition of an in-frame stop codon by using the oligonucleotides 5′-AGATCTATGAGCGAGTCGGGCTCA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTACTTCTCCAGTTTCTTGGG-3′. This insert was then cloned into the BamHI site of pPAC. A prokaryotic expression clone was also made by cloning this insert into the BglII site of pRSET B. The HMG-I(Y)1–45 mutant was made by PCR amplification of nucleotides 202 to 336, with the addition of an in-frame stop codon, by using the (5′-AGA…) oligonucleotide that had been used to produce HMG-I(Y)1–81 and 5′-GGATCCTATCTCTTCGGAGTTGGCAC-3′. This insert was cloned into the BamHI site of pPAC and the BglII site of pRSET B. The HMG-I(Y)50–96 mutant was generated by PCR amplification of nucleotides 352 to 1673, followed by addition of an in-frame initiation codon (full details available on request). This insert was cloned into the BamHI site of pPAC and the BglII and EcoRI sites of pRSET C. The HMG-I(Y)50–81 mutant was generated by PCR amplification of nucleotides 352 to 444 by using the oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGATCCAAAGGGAAGCAAGAATAAGGGC-3′ and the (5′-GGA…) oligonucleotide that had been used for HMG-I(Y)1–81. This insert was cloned into the BamHI site of pRSET C. The accuracy of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The prokaryotic expression plasmids pRSETHMG-I(Y), pRSETHMGI-(Y)1–81, pRSETHMG-I(Y)1–45, pRSETHMG-I(Y)50–96, pRSETHMG-I(Y)50–81, and pRSETSRF, each encoding a vector-derived polyhistidine tag and an enterokinase cleavage site in addition to the cloned insert protein, were transferred into the protease-deficient E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Expression was induced in 500-ml cultures (mid-log phase) by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. Three h after induction, the bacterial cells were lysed and purified by cobalt affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Proteins were renatured by dialysis overnight against 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.8), 20 mm KCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 at 4 °C. The dialysate was stored in 50-μl aliquots at −80 °C. Annealed oligonucleotides for the SM22α CArG box (described above) and the c-fos serum response element CArG box (5′-GTACCGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT-3′ and 5′-GTACAGATGTCCTAATATGGACATCCG-3′) were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Approximately 35 fmol of labeled DNA was used in each binding reaction. Binding reactions were performed in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 50 ng of poly(dG-dC), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 250 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature in a total volume of 20 μl. The DNA-protein complexes were then loaded onto chilled 4% polyacrylamide gels. Gel electrophoresis (15 V/cm) was performed in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C. Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured and transfected essentially as described (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). In brief, SL2 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method on 6-well trays at approximately 50% confluence with plasmids encoding proteins as outlined in Figs.1 A and 5. Plasmid phsp82LacZ (100 ng), which encodes β-galactosidase transcribed from a Drosophila heat shock promoter, was cotransfected in all experiments to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The ratio of luciferase to β-galactosidase from each plasmid was calculated and expressed as relative luciferase activity, with the value for pPAC set arbitrarily at 1. The yeast strain MCY-1, a derivative of EGY48 (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar), was created by transforming EGY48 with the integrating vector pCArG3LacZi. The cells were transformed by the lithium acetate procedure as described (30Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays on transfected SL2 cell lysates were performed as described (31Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Zhou F. Tsai J.C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Yeast β-galactosidase assays were also performed as described (32Kho C.J. Huggins G.S. Endege W.O. Hsieh C.M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol.

A luciferase construct containing the SM22α promoter was transfected with the indicated expression plasmids, and activity was normalized to β-galactosidase as described for Fig. 1.

Smith M.C. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 630-641PubMed Google Scholar), with some modification. In brief, [35S]methionine-labeled SRF was prepared from pcDNA3SRF with an in vitrotranscription/translation kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega). A 20-μl bed volume of cobalt affinity resin (CLONTECH) was equilibrated in a 1.7 ml microcentrifuge tube with 500 μl of ice-cold binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaPO4(pH 8.0), and 100 mm NaCl). The resin was collected by centrifugation (14000 × g, 1 min) and washed with an additional 500 μl of binding buffer. After a second centrifugation, the resin was resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer with 1 μg of recombinant histidine-tagged protein and 1 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled SRF. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with rotary shaking. The resin was then washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold binding buffer and collected by centrifugation as above. Bound protein was eluted with 20 μl of 100 mm EDTA and analyzed on 10% Tricine-SDS gels as described (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). Given that the HMG-I proteins bind to AT-rich sequences and enhance transcription by recruiting other factors, we tested the hypothesis that HMG-I(Y) might bind CArG boxes and enhance SRF-dependent transcription. Transient transfection assays were performed in Drosophila SL2 cells because they do not express high levels of SRF or HMG-I(Y) and are thus ideally suited for studying the effects of these proteins on transcription (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 26Natesan S. Gilman M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5975-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transfection of the pPAC, HMG-I(Y), or SRF expression plasmid alone had little effect on the activity of the SM22α promoter (Fig. 1 A). Transfection of the SRF and the HMG-I(Y) expression plasmids together, however, increased SM22α promoter activity by ∼20-fold. HMG-I(Y) and SRF had a similar synergistic effect on the c-fospromoter (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether this effect was mediated by the CArG box alone, we introduced three copies of the SM22α CArG box into a yeast β-galactosidase expression vector and created a stable yeast strain with this construct integrated into the genome. This approach would also reveal whether the HMG-I proteins affected genetic signals incorporated into genomic chromatin. Neither HMG-I(Y) nor HMGI-C had any effect on β-galactosidase expression (Fig. 1 B). SRF alone also had no significant effect in yeast (Fig. 1 B), consistent with data published elsewhere (35Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). When HMG-I(Y) or HMGI-C was coexpressed with SRF, β-galactosidase expression increased by ∼15-fold (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that HMG-I proteins activate transcription by interacting with SRF through the CArG box. As a preliminary exploration of how HMG-I proteins enhance SRF-dependent transcription, we determined whether HMG-I proteins bound specifically to SRF-binding sites through their AT-rich consensus sequence. Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged HMG-I(Y) and HMGI-C were expressed in E. coli, purified by cobalt affinity chromatography, and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A DNA-protein complex formed when HMG-I(Y) was incubated with a labeled, SM22α CArG box probe (Fig. 2,left panel, arrow). The binding was specific because a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide probe encoding the SM22α CArG box or the c-fos CArG box, but not one encoding an unrelated sequence, competed for HMG-I(Y) binding. Results from a similar analysis with a labeled c-fos CArG box probe were identical (Fig. 2, right panel). Results obtained with recombinant HMGI-C were similar (data not shown). To explore the functional significance of HMG-I(Y) binding to the CArG box, we investigated the effect of HMG-I(Y) on the binding of SRF. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with increasing amounts of purified, recombinant polyhistidine-tagged SRF in the presence or absence of HMG-I(Y). SRF binding to the c-fosCArG box probe resulted in a slowly migrating DNA-protein complex (Fig. 3), whereas HMG-I(Y) binding produced a more rapidly migrating complex. In the presence of HMG-I(Y), SRF binding increased markedly. The presence of SRF in the slowly migrating complex was verified by its supershifting in the presence of anti-SRF antibody (Fig. 3, last lane). Similar results were obtained with an SM22α CArG box probe and with recombinant HMGI-C (data not shown). These results suggest an important role for HMG-I proteins in enhancing the binding of SRF to DNA and promoting the assembly of DNA-protein complexes. We determined whether HMG-I(Y) interacted with SRF in the absence of DNA and identified the HMG-I(Y) domain required for this interaction by a CP-IMAC method (33Kasher M.S. Wakulchik M. Cook J.A. Smith M.C. Biotechniques. 1993; 14: 630-641PubMed Google Scholar). In this experiment (summarized in Fig. 4 A), recombinant polyhistidine-tagged mutant and wild-type HMG-I(Y) proteins were incubated in the presence of a cobalt-Sepharose resin with radiolabeled, in vitro translated SRF. Because proteins that interacted with labeled SRF would retain SRF on the resin, labeled SRF would appear on the protein gel after elution from the resin. Deletion of HMG-I(Y) C-terminal amino acids 82–96 (containing the acidic domain) had no effect on its interaction with SRF (Fig. 4 B,lane 1-96 versus lane 1-81). Further deletion to amino acid 45, however, abolished the ability of HMG-I(Y) to retain SRF on the resin (Fig. 4 B, lane 1-81 versus lane 1-45). Because deletion of amino-terminal residues 1–50 also had no effect on the interaction with SRF (Fig. 4 B, lane 50-96), the region of HMG-I(Y) required for SRF binding appeared to map to amino acids 50–81. Indeed, this position was confirmed by lane 50-81 of Fig. 4 B, which shows that this domain of HMG-I(Y) interacts directly with SRF. To see if HMG-I(Y) had to bind to DNA to augment SRF binding, we used the mutant HMG-I(Y) proteins shown in Fig. 4 A in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with the c-fos CArG box probe. Consistent with our data shown in Fig. 3, wild-type HMG-I(Y) bound to DNA and augmented SRF binding (Fig. 4 C, lane 1-96). Similar results were obtained for HMG-I(Y)1–81 (data not shown). HMG-I(Y)50–96, HMG-I(Y)50–81, and HMG-I(Y)1–45 did not bind DNA (Fig. 4 C,SRF− lanes), consistent with results published by others (36Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, HMG-I(Y)50–96 and HMG-I(Y)50–81 were able to enhance binding of SRF to the CArG box despite their inability to bind DNA (Fig. 4 C,SRF+ lanes). Because the effect of HMG-I(Y) on SRF was independent of DNA binding, it probably involved protein-protein interactions. Because HMG-I(Y)50–96 augmented SRF binding in the absence of DNA binding, we studied its effect on SRF-dependent transcription. HMG-I(Y)50–96, HMG-I(Y)1–81, and HMG-I(Y)1–45 were cloned into the Drosophila expression vector pPAC (27Krasnow M.A. Saffman E.E. Kornfeld K. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1989; 57: 1031-1043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The activity of HMG-I(Y)1–81 was similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 5), a result consistent with the ability of HMG-I(Y)1–81 to bind SRF and enhance SRF binding to DNA in vitro (Figs. 3 and 4 , B and C, and data not shown). HMG-I(Y)1–45, a protein unable to interact with SRF or enhance SRF binding to DNA in vitro, had no significant activity. In contrast, HMG-I(Y)50–96, which does not bind DNA but clearly enhances SRF binding to DNA in vitro, was able to stimulate SRF-dependent transcription to a level 10-fold above base line (Fig. 5). These data indicate that the effect of HMG-I(Y) on SRF-dependent transcription is independent of the ability of HMG-I(Y) to bind DNA. Little is known about the mechanisms by which HMG-I proteins affect cell growth and differentiation. In contrast, SRF is known to regulate a number of immediate-early genes, such as c-fos, thought to be important in cell proliferation. The presence of an AT-rich core within the SRF-binding site (a CArG box) led us to hypothesize that the HMG-I proteins and SRF may interact at this element. We found that HMG-I(Y) facilitates activation of the c-fospromoter by SRF (Fig. 1 A) and that transcriptional activation by HMG-I(Y) could be mediated by the CArG box alone when it was linked to a heterologous promoter in the context of genomic chromatin (Fig. 1 B). Our findings are consistent with previous reports that HMG-I(Y) itself does not have an intrinsic ability to activate promoters but that it can alter chromatin structure and regulate the activity of other transcription factors (12Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that HMG-I proteins may be involved in the regulation of a variety of SRF-responsive genes. The recent observation that expression of junB, an SRF-responsive gene, is essential for neoplastic transformation in rat thyroid cells, and that it requires concurrent expression of HMGI-C (37Vallone D. Battista S. Pierantoni G.M. Fedele M. Casalino L. Santoro M. Viglietto G. Fusco F. Verde P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5310-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), is consistent with our data. Our findings also suggest a potential mechanism by which HMG-I proteins interact with SRF and participate in the regulation of growth-related genes. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an interaction between a MADS-box transcription factor such as SRF and the HMG-I proteins. Given that the MADS-box protein MEF2 also has AT-rich recognition sequences, our results raise the possibility that HMG-I proteins may interact with other members of the MADS-box transcription factor family to regulate their function. SRF and the CArG box have also been implicated in the regulation of muscle-specific gene expression (4Sartorelli V. Webster K.A. Kedes L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1811-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 38Chen C.Y. Croissant J. Majesky M. Topouzis S. McQuinn T. Frankovsky M.J. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Galvagni F. Lestingi M. Cartocci E. Oliviero S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 6065-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Therefore, by interacting with SRF, HMG-I proteins may play a role in muscle-specific gene regulation as well. This speculation is supported by our finding that HMG-I(Y) markedly enhances the SRF-induced promoter activity of SM22α, a smooth muscle-specific gene (Fig. 1 A). The biological significance of this effect remains to be elucidated. One possibility, currently being explored, is that the effect of HMG-I(Y) proteins on smooth muscle may be important after hypertrophic stimuli. To understand the mechanism by which HMG-I proteins enhance SRF-dependent transcription, we analyzed the binding of HMG-I proteins to the CArG box and assessed their effect on SRF binding to DNA. As expected, given its preference for AT-rich DNA, HMG-I(Y) binds to CArG boxes specifically (Fig. 2). Also, SRF binding to the CArG box is enhanced dramatically in the presence of HMG-I(Y) (Fig. 3). Although little change was seen in the mobility of the SRF-containing complex generated in the presence of HMG-I(Y), this was probably due to the low molecular weight of HMG-I(Y) relative to SRF and to the marked change in DNA conformation already induced in the presence of SRF (42Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The sharp bend in the DNA induced by SRF binding alters electrophoretic mobility markedly so that an additional effect of HMG-I(Y) may not be apparent. By a CP-IMAC assay, we found that HMG-I(Y) and SRF interact in the absence of DNA (Fig. 4 B). Mutational analysis indicated that the region of interaction comprises amino acids 50–81, an area surrounding the third AT-hook domain. It has been shown that HMG-I(Y) amino acids 46–56 contain the domain that binds Oct-6, a POU-domain transcription factor (43Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We do not know whether the Oct-6 and SRF interaction domains are distinct, and we know little about the region of HMG-I(Y) required for binding to other transcription factors. Computer data base searching with the BLAST algorithm (44Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70722) Google Scholar) revealed no significant homology between this peptide interaction domain and a domain in any protein other than HMG-I(Y). Fig. 1 B shows that the effect of wild-type HMGI-C on SRF is similar to that of HMG-I(Y). Other than the AT hooks in this region, however, these two proteins share little homology. This lack of homology raises the possibility that the effect of HMGI-C involves a different domain. Our results from in vitro binding studies of wild-type HMG-I(Y) and SRF are consistent with results from transfection assays; however, the results from the former are somewhat surprising given that each protein is expected to bind in the minor groove (7Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Pellegrini L. Tan S. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). We found that mutations that removed the first and second or second and third AT-hook domains block DNA binding (Fig. 4), consistent with published findings that the second AT-hook domain is important for sequence-specific binding (36Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). HMG-I(Y)50–96 and HMG-I(Y)50–81 are not able to bind DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, although they are able to enhance the binding of SRF to DNA, at a level similar to that obtained with wild-type HMG-I(Y). This observation is in contrast to those obtained in other studies which show that DNA binding by HMG-I(Y) is critical to enhancement of Oct-6 binding to the JC virus promoter (43Leger H. Sock E. Renner K. Grummt F. Wegner M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3738-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and activation of the β-interferon promoter by NF-κB (36Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One explanation for our observations is that the interaction of HMG-I(Y) with SRF induces a conformational change in SRF that enhances its ability to bind to DNA. Further studies will be necessary to test this hypothesis. Although our data (Fig. 4) and data reported by Yie et al.(36Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) indicate that the third AT hook does not bind specifically to DNA in gel mobility shift assays, it remains possible that the third AT-hook domain present in their and our HMG-I(Y) mutants may bind DNAin vivo. In a recent NMR study, Huth et al. (45Huth J.R. Bewley C.A. Nissen M.S. Evans J.N. Reeves R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) show that the third AT hook makes specific contacts with DNA when bound as part of a molecule containing the second AT hook. A previous NMR study also showed that a peptide containing the core AT-hook motif PRGRP binds specifically to the minor groove of AT-rich DNA, but with low affinity (46Geierstanger B.H. Volkman B.F. Kremer W. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5347-5355Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the transient transfection analysis (Fig. 5), all mutations that preserve the interaction with SRF in vitro enhance SRF-dependent transcription in vivo. HMG-I(Y)50–96, which does not bind DNA, still augments transcription though to a lesser degree than does wild-type HMG-I(Y). The reasons for the slight disparity between these in vivodata and the in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay data are not clear. It is worthy of note that deletion of the C-terminal acidic tail (Figs. 4 A and 5) does not affect the ability of HMG-I(Y) to enhance SRF-dependent transcription. Our results are in contrast with results from studies by others on the β-interferon gene, in which the acidic tail of HMG-I(Y) was shown to be necessary for NF-κB coactivation (36Yie J. Liang S. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3649-3662Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

During keratinocyte growth and differentiation, glucosylceramide (GlcCer) 1The abbreviations used are: GlcCer, glucosylceramide; BODIPY™, boron dipyrromethene difluoride; C5-DMB, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]; C5-DMB-Cer,N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-d-erythro-sphingosine; C5-DMB-GlcCer, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-glucosyl sphingosine; SM, sphingomyelin; C5-DMB-SM, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; Cer, ceramide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DF-BSA, defatted BSA; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; HMEM, 10 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane sulfonic acid-buffered minimum essential medium, pH 7.4, without indicator; TGN, trans-Golgi network; bp, base pair; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: GlcCer, glucosylceramide; BODIPY™, boron dipyrromethene difluoride; C5-DMB, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]; C5-DMB-Cer,N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-d-erythro-sphingosine; C5-DMB-GlcCer, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-glucosyl sphingosine; SM, sphingomyelin; C5-DMB-SM, N-[5-(5,7-dimethyl BODIPY™)-1-pentanoyl]-sphingosylphosphorylcholine; Cer, ceramide; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DF-BSA, defatted BSA; GCS, glucosylceramide synthase; HMEM, 10 mm 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane sulfonic acid-buffered minimum essential medium, pH 7.4, without indicator; TGN, trans-Golgi network; bp, base pair; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. is thought to be synthesized intracellularly and subsequently transported and stored in lamellar bodies. At later stages of the differentiation process, the contents of these granules are secreted into the stratum corneum by exocytosis, and the GlcCer is subsequently hydrolyzed by the enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase to ceramide (Cer), a major lipid constituent of the epidermal barrier (1Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,2Holleran W.M. Ginns E.I. Menon G.K. Grundmann J.-U. Fartasch M. McKinney C.E. Elias P.M. Sidransky E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1756-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated an increase of GlcCer synthase (GCS) activity during keratinocyte differentiation. GCS activity was measured in lysates of cultured human keratinocytes using radioactive or fluorescent substrates and was found to reach a maximum level 8 days after induction of the differentiation process (3Sando G.N. Howard E.J. Madison K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In fetal rats of gestational age 17–21 days, GCS activity in the epidermis peaks at day 19, prior to epidermal barrier competence (4Hanley K. Jiang Y. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 576-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Parallel studies have also demonstrated that β-glucocerebrosidase activity and expression increase during keratinocyte differentiation and barrier formation (3Sando G.N. Howard E.J. Madison K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,4Hanley K. Jiang Y. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Williams M.L. Feingold K.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 576-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although these events are not as closely correlated with keratinocyte differentiation as the induction of GCS activity. Although these studies indicate induction of GCS activity during keratinocyte differentiation, little is known about the regulation of this enzyme. In particular, it is not yet known whether the induction of GlcCer synthesis is due to regulation at the transcriptional or translational levels, to post-translational modifications of the enzyme, to alterations in GlcCer degradation, or to some other factor(s) that play a role in modulating GCS activity during differentiation. Recently the human cDNA sequence for GCS was identified (5Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), making possible the generation of new reagents to address some of these questions. In the present study, we have raised anti-peptide antibodies to human GCS suitable for Western blotting and have generated cDNA probes to GCS so that we could study GCS mRNA levels during differentiation. Using these tools we show that GCS expression is most likely up-regulated at the transcriptional level during keratinocyte differentiation. Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin specimens, and primary cultures were initiated and maintained in a replicative state using serum-free (“complete”) growth medium (MCDB153 medium (6Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. In Vitro Models for Cancer Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 245-475Google Scholar) containing 0.1 mmCa+2 and supplemented with 0.2% (v/v) bovine pituitary extract, epidermal growth factor (10 ng/ml), insulin (5 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (5 × 10−7m), ethanolamine (1 × 10−4m), and phosphoethanolamine (1 × 10−4m)) (7Wille Jr, J.J. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. Scott R.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 121: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Subconfluent keratinocytes from primary cultures were plated into secondary cultures at 1–10 × 103cells/cm2. At confluence (day 0), cultures were washed several times with 1.5 mm Ca+2 MCDB153 medium without any growth factors, hormones, or bovine pituitary extract (“differentiation medium”) to initiate the differentiation process. The cultures were re-fed differentiation medium every other day (8Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 60-mm diameter tissue culture dishes for biochemical studies or on number 1 thickness glass coverslips for fluorescence microscopy. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. N-[5-(5, 7-dimethyl BODIPY™-1-pentanoyl]-d-erythro-sphingosine (C5-DMB-Cer or “BODIPY™-Ceramide,” Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene OR) was prepared as a BSA complex in HMEM and stored at −20 °C as described previously (9Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, NY1997: 505-510Google Scholar). For in situ GCS and sphingomyelin (SM) synthase activity assays, keratinocytes at various stages of differentiation cultured on coverslips were washed with HMEM and then incubated with 2 μm C5-DMB-Cer/BSA for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with HMEM and either extracted immediately or further incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the presence of 5% defatted BSA (DF-BSA, Intergen, Purchase, NY). In the latter case, the samples were subsequently incubated (six times for 10 min each) with 5% DF-BSA at 10 °C (“back-exchanged”) prior to lipid extraction (10Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed with ice-cold HMEM and scraped from the culture dish, and the lipids were extracted, separated by thin layer chromatography, and quantified as described previously (11Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar, 12Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). GCS and SM synthase activity values were normalized to cellular protein (13Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For fluorescence microscopy, keratinocytes were incubated with 2 μm C5-DMB-Cer/BSA and then back-exchanged as described above. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with an inverted microscope (IM-35, Carl Zeiss, Inc.) equipped with a Planapo 100× (1.3 NA) objective and epifluorescence optics. Samples were excited at 450–490 nm, and the fluorescence was observed at either ≥520 nm (green + red wavelengths) or at ≥590 nm (red wavelengths) (14Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A peptide with the sequence TISWRTGRYRLRCGGTAEEILDV corresponding to the 23 C-terminal amino acid residues of human GCS (5Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was synthesized as an antigen for immunization. Specific antiserum was raised in rabbits 8 weeks after inoculation with the synthesized peptide. For immunoprecipitation studies, antibodies were purified using the corresponding peptide antibodies linked to Aminolink Plus columns (Pierce). Purified antibodies were coupled to protein A Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) using dimethylpimelimidate coupling as described (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1988; (and 522–523, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 447Google Scholar). Keratinocyte cultures at the various stages of differentiation were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then solubilized with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1988; (and 522–523, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 447Google Scholar) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell extracts then were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants, corresponding to equal amounts of cellular protein, were incubated for 2 h with antibody-linked beads at room temperature with continuous rocking. The beads were spun down, and the pellet was washed with RIPA buffer (three times for 10 min each) at room temperature. The pellets were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer with 8 m urea, and the supernatants were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a PVDF membrane (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar, 17Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 435074354Crossref Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). The membrane was incubated successively with rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:1,000) against human GCS and horseradish-peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000; Boehringer Mannheim) and then visualized with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A 966-bp partial GCS cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 52–1017 of the published sequence of human GCS (5Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) was obtained from human skin fibroblasts by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total RNA was isolated from human skin fibroblasts, and GCS-specific primers were designed on the basis of human GCS cDNA sequences (5Ichikawa S. Sakiyama H. Suzuki G. Hidari K.I.-P.J. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4638-4643Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and synthesized as follows: 5′-CTCTTCTTGGTGCTGTGGCTGATGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-ACCCTGGACACCCCTGAGTTGAATG-3′ (reverse primer). The 966-bp PCR-amplified GCS cDNA fragment was cloned into the PCR II vector at the EcoRI site. A search of the GenBank™ and EMBL data bases using the GCG program (Genetic Computer Group, Inc., Madison WI) showed that the 966-bp cDNA sequence did not have significant homology with any other known genes. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from keratinocyte cultures at various stages of differentiation by the method of Schwabet al. (18Schwab M. Alitalo K. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. George D. Nature. 1983; 303: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA samples (4 μg/lane) were resolved on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were initially hybridized at 43 °C with [α-32P]dCTP random labeled DNA probes that included cDNAs for human keratin 1, an early marker for terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, and keratin 14, a basal keratinocyte proliferative marker (8Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Roop D.R. Krieg T.M. Mehrel T. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3245-3252PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membranes were washed (three times for 15 min each time at 25 °C) with 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS, washed (15 min at 43 °C) with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS and then washed (twice for 15 min each time at 65 °C) with 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Membranes were then exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C. After being stripped of previous probes by heating in 0.2× SSC, 0.5% SDS for 10 min at 100 °C, the membranes were reprobed with 32P random labeled 966-bp DNA probe for human GCS (see above) for 1 h at 65 °C in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH, Palo Alto CA). After hybridization, the membranes were washed (three times for 15 min each time at room temperature) with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and then washed (twice for 20 min each time at 50 °C) with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Each membrane was also hybridized as described above with a GAPDH cDNA probe for normalization of mRNA levels. mRNA levels were quantified using a Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Normal human keratinocytes were seeded into complete growth medium, grown to confluence, and induced to differentiate by switching to differentiation medium and elevating the Ca+2concentration from 0.1 to 1.5 mm (see “Experimental Procedures” and Refs. 6Boyce S.T. Ham R.G. In Vitro Models for Cancer Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 245-475Google Scholar and 7Wille Jr, J.J. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. Scott R.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 121: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As previously shown (7Wille Jr, J.J. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. Scott R.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 121: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), this results in a population of differentiating keratinocytes containing lamellar granules and induces the expression of keratin 1, both of which are markers for keratinocyte differentiation. We first examined the metabolism of C5-DMB-Cer, a fluorescent Cer analog, in keratinocyte cultures using an in situ assay. At various time points following the switch to differentiating medium, cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with C5-DMB-Cer/BSA, and the fluorescent metabolites were quantified and normalized to cellular protein. Formation of C5-DMB-GlcCer increased markedly during differentiation, peaking at day 6 (∼5-fold increase compared with day 0) following induction of differentiation, whereas the amount of C5-DMB-SM that was formed remained relatively constant at each time point (Fig. 1). For fluorescence microscopy, keratinocyte cultures were incubated with 2 μm C5-DMB-Cer for 30 min at 37 °C, washed and further incubated with BSA for 90 min at 37 °C, and then back-exchanged (see “Experimental Procedures”) at low temperature to remove fluorescent lipids at the plasma membrane (10Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated a dramatic change in the distribution of intracellular fluorescence upon differentiation (Fig. 2). At confluence (day 0), fluorescence was concentrated in a perinuclear region that, based on previous studies in other cell types (9Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, NY1997: 505-510Google Scholar, 14Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), corresponds to the Golgi apparatus. The prominent red fluorescence further indicates that the lipid was concentrated in this organelle because the fluorescence emission of the BODIPY™-fluorophore shifts from green to red wavelengths with increasing concentration (10Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 20Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 101-118PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chen C.-S. Martin O.C. Pagano R.E. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 37-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, when cells from day 6 were used, the fluorescent lipid (and its metabolites) was widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm in punctate structures. Many of these “dot-like” bodies coincided with refractile structures that could be observed by phase microscopy (not shown). Metabolism studies using C5-DMB-Cer under the conditions used for the microscopy studies revealed that day 6 differentiated cells accumulated ∼3-fold more total C5-DMB fluorescence than day 0 cells; however, the proportions of C5-DMB-Cer, C5-DMB-GlcCer, and C5-DMB-SM were similar (∼20, 10, and 65%, respectively) at days 0 and 6 (see legend of Fig. 2). Polyclonal antibodies were raised against three different peptides that were synthesized using the predicted amino acid sequence of human GCS. For these antibodies, (i) each recognized a ∼38-kDa polypeptide in rat liver Golgi membranes by immunoblotting, (ii) each immunoprecipitated this same ∼38-kDa band, and (iii) two of these antibodies could be used to immunoprecipitate GCS activity from a detergent solubilized enzyme preparation from rat liver. 2D. L. Marks, P. Paul, Y. Kamisaka, and R. E. Pagano, manuscript in preparation. Each of the three antibodies recognized GCS as a ∼38-kDa polypeptide in human keratinocytes (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the ∼38-kDa polypeptide corresponds to GCS. In the present study, one of the antibodies was used to examine the time course of GCS expression during differentiation of human keratinocytes (Fig. 3). In this experiment, cell lysates were prepared from keratinocytes at different stages of differentiation, and supernatants corresponding to equal amounts of cellular protein were immunoprecipitated with antibody-linked beads to enrich the samples for GCS. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blotting with the same anti-GCS peptide antibody. As seen in Fig. 3, GCS protein expression was detectable in confluent cultures at day 0 and increased ∼5-fold during keratinocyte differentiation, reaching a maximum at days 6–8 following the switch to differentiation medium. We next used a 966-bp cDNA probe to GCS to examine the time course of mRNA expression during keratinocyte differentiation. GCS mRNA expression was detected as a 3.8-kilobase transcript on Northern blots at culture confluence (day 0) and increased steadily following the switch to differentiation medium, reaching a peak at about 8 days (Fig. 4). A similar but earlier increase in expression was observed for keratin 1 mRNA, an early marker for terminal differentiation in keratinocytes (8Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 19Roop D.R. Krieg T.M. Mehrel T. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3245-3252PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the expression of keratin 14 mRNA, a basal keratinocyte proliferative marker (19Roop D.R. Krieg T.M. Mehrel T. Cheng C.K. Yuspa S.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 3245-3252PubMed Google Scholar), was relatively unchanged in stratifying cultures undergoing differentiation. GAPDH mRNA was used for normalization of these data. Keratinocyte differentiation in terrestrial mammals is characterized by a programmed sequence of biochemical and morphological changes that eventually produce the epidermal permeability barrier (1Downing D.T. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 301-313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). During terminal differentiation of keratinocytes into a stratified epithelium, complex changes in lipid synthesis and organization occur. Keratinocytes become enriched in specific lipids and form lamellar granules that are thought to be enriched in the glycolipid, GlcCer. Upon extrusion of the lamellar granules into intercellular spaces at the junction of viable granular layer and nonviable cell layers of the stratum corneum, GlcCer is converted to Cer, which becomes a major component of the epidermal permeability barrier. Thus, the production of GlcCer by GCS plays a critical role in the formation of the functional cornified epithelium. In the present study we demonstrate that GCS activity, mRNA, and protein expression increase in coordination with differentiation in a defined human keratinocyte culture model. Our study is consistent with previous work that demonstrated an increase in GCS activity during keratinocyte differentiation by assaying enzymatic activity in cell homogenates using various Cer substrates (3Sando G.N. Howard E.J. Madison K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, the present study is the first to demonstrate the up-regulation of GCS mRNA and protein expression during keratinocyte differentiation. Our results suggest that GCS is up-regulated at the transcriptional level during keratinocyte differentiation. We found that although GCS mRNA (Fig. 4) and protein expression (Fig. 3) peaked at day 8 of differentiation, GCS activity (Fig. 1) in situ was highest at day 6. Based on these data we speculate that after day 6, increased levels of β-glucocerebrosidase may degrade newly formed GlcCer during the in situ assay, causing a decrease in apparent GCS activity at day 8. This would be consistent with the reported increase in β-glucocerebrosidase activity observed during late stages of keratinocyte differentiation in culture and during epidermal development (3Sando G.N. Howard E.J. Madison K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 4Hanley K. Jiang Y. Holleran W.M. Elias P.M. Williams M.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 22044-22051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), GCS activity increased with keratinocyte differentiation induced by a complex regimen of medium changes, including serum addition. Previous findings by us (7Wille Jr, J.J. Pittelkow M.R. Shipley G.D. Scott R.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1984; 121: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 8Poumay Y. Pittelkow M.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and others (23Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hicenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24Van Ruissen F. de Jongh G.J. Zeeuwen P.L. Van Erp P.E. Madsen P. Schalkwijk J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 168: 442-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown that serum markedly alters both keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, including expression of various differentiation-related proteins and organelles such as lamellar bodies. In the present study, cells were grown in serum-free culture medium, and differentiation was induced by growth to confluence and a switch to defined medium containing elevated Ca+2 concentration and the absence of exogenous growth factors and hormones. Thus, our study demonstrates that the increase in GCS expression observed during keratinocyte differentiation does not require the presence of any added hormones or growth factors, although the removal of specific factors (present in complete medium) and culture confluence may act as triggers to stimulate both GCS expression and differentiation. Future studies using this defined and easy to manipulate culture system will allow us to examine the effects of various factors (e.g. vitamins, lipids, antioxidants, and growth factors) that may play a role in regulating keratinocyte differentiation and GCS function without interference by undefined serum factors. In the present study, we used a BODIPY™-labeled analog of ceramide, C5-DMB-Cer, for both in situ assays of GCS activity and morphologic studies of sphingolipid distribution in differentiating keratinocytes. This fluorescent ceramide analog exhibits a shift in fluorescence emission from green to red wavelengths as its concentration in membranes is increased. Thus, we were able to clearly observe the regions of highest fluorescence accumulation in keratinocytes by fluorescence microscopy. When undifferentiated keratinocytes were incubated with C5-DMB-Cer, fluorescence was concentrated in perinuclear sacs and vesicle-like structures, consistent with the targeting of fluorescent ceramide and/or its metabolites to the Golgi complex, as observed in other cell types (9Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, NY1997: 505-510Google Scholar,14Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 20Rosenwald A.G. Pagano R.E. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 101-118PubMed Google Scholar). However, with increasing differentiation the distribution of C5-DMB fluorescence was altered markedly, becoming predominantly localized to large vesicle-like structures distributed throughout the cells. We and others have previously shown that when fluorescent ceramides are added to cells, the fluorescent probe accumulates in the membranes of the trans-Golgi ortrans-Golgi network (TGN), probably due to a specific affinity of fluorescent ceramides for these Golgi membranes (14Pagano R.E. Martin O.C. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1267-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 25Pagano R.E. Sepanski M.A. Martin O.C. J. Cell.

Based on these observations, we suggest that the fluorescent vesicles observed in differentiated keratinocytes are derived from the trans-Golgi or TGN and that this compartment is extensively modified in differentiated keratinocytes to function in the production of lamellar bodies. This conclusion is consistent with recent observations that differentiated keratinocytes of the stratum granulosum possess a widely dispersed trans-Golgi-like network closely associated with interconnected lamellar bodies (27Elias P. M Cullander C. Mauro T. Rassner U. Kömüves L. Brown B.E. Menon G.K. J. Invest. Derm. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Work is in progress in our laboratory to characterize the structures labeled by C5-DMB in differentiated keratinocytes by immunolocalization of TGN38 (28Luzio J., B, B. Banting G. Howell K. Braghetta P. Stanley K. Biochem. J. 1990; 270: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and other Golgi markers and determine the relationship of these structures to lamellar bodies. In the meantime, several findings in our study should stimulate new directions in the fields of both glycosphingolipid function and keratinocyte differentiation. First, our differentiation model in which no exogenous hormones or growth factors are needed to stimulate both differentiation and GCS expression represents an ideal system to study what mechanisms (e.g. Ca+2, hormones, and autocrine factors) are involved in the regulation of GCS expression. Indeed, although the cDNA for human GCS has been cloned, presently there is nothing known about the mechanisms of regulation (e.g. promoter regions and relevant transcription factors) of GCS expression. Second, we found that GCS expression increased in coordination with the level of differentiation, but it is unknown whether GCS is required as part of the normal differentiation program. Disruption of GCS expression (e.g. using antisense oligonucleotides or transfection with mutant GCS constructs) or use of specific inhibitors to block GCS activity (29Inokuchi J.-I. Radin N.S. J. Lipid Res. 1987; 28: 565-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during keratinocyte differentiation would allow us to determine whether GCS expression or activity is necessary for keratinocyte differentiation. It will also be of interest to use the tools described in this paper to study the localization of GCS (e.g. by immunolocalization) and the mechanisms by which GlcCer is targetted to lamellar granules in keratinocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2080804130,"Glycosylasparaginase is an N-terminal nucleophile hydrolase and is activated by intramolecular autoproteolytic processing. This cis-autoproteolysis possesses unique kinetics characterized by a reversible N-O acyl rearrangement step in the processing. Arg-180 and Asp-183, involved in binding of the substrate in the mature enzyme, are also involved in binding of free amino acids in the partially formed substrate pocket on certain mutant precursors. This binding site is sequestered in the wild-type precursor. Binding of free amino acids on mutant precursors can either inhibit or accelerate their processing, depending on the individual mutants and amino acids. The polypeptide sequence at the processing site, which is highly conserved, adopts a special conformation. Asp-151 is essential for maintaining this conformation, possibly by anchoring its side chain into the partially formed substrate pocket through interaction with Arg-180. The reactive nucleophile Thr-152 is activated not only by deprotonation by His-150 but also by interaction with Thr-170, suggesting a His-Thr-Thr active triad for the autoproteolysis.

Glycosylasparaginase hydrolyzes the β-N-glycosidic bond between asparagine and N-acetylglucosamine of asparagine-linked glycans (1Makino M. Kojima T. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Glycosylasparaginases from different sources consist of two non-identical α- and β-subunits held together by strong non-covalent forces (2Fisher K.J. Tollersrud O.K. Aronson Jr., N.N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 3Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M.B. Aronson Jr., N.N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Glycosylasparaginase is encoded by a single gene and is initially synthesized as a single polypeptide that is post-translationally processed (2Fisher K.J. Tollersrud O.K. Aronson Jr., N.N. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This processing is an obligatory step in the production of active enzyme, and cleavage of a single peptide bond is responsible for this activation (3Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M.B. Aronson Jr., N.N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Ikonen E. Jukunen I. Tollersrud O.K. Kakkinen N. Peltonen L.

Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The enzyme active center has been characterized and is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The proposed reaction mechanism is as follows. The hydroxyl of the N-terminal nucleophile Thr-183 is probably activated by its own α-amino group and attacks the β-carbonyl of the asparagine part of the substrate to form the tetrahedral transitional intermediate. The negatively charged carbonyl oxygen of the transitional state is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from the hydroxyl of Thr-234 and the main chain nitrogen of Gly-235. The transitional intermediate collapses into the acyl-enzyme intermediate and releases the sugar part of the substrate. The acyl-enzyme intermediate is hydrolyzed by water. Besides the interactions mentioned above, the substrate binding is achieved by hydrogen bonding of the α-carboxylate and the α-amino group of the substrate to Arg-211 and Asp-214, respectively. The hydrogen interaction between Thr-183 and Thr-201 is also important for the enzymatic activity. In a previous study (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), using a cloned glycosylasparaginase fromFlavobacterium meningosepticum (10Tarentino A.L. Plummer T.H.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 197: 179-186Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.M. Plummer T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the activation is an intramolecular autoproteolytic processing event. Based on the experimental data, we proposed a cis-autoproteolysis model for glycosylasparaginase activation as illustrated in Fig. 1 B. Since Ntn-enzymes have in common an unusual fold and the active N-terminal nucleophile is most often generated by autoproteolytic processing (5Brannigan J.A. Dogson G. Duggledy H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we suggested that the cis-autoproteolysis model may also, with some variations, be held for processing of other Ntn-enzymes. Cis-autoproteolytic processing is a newly found post-translational modification that is involved in many important cellular processes, such as enzyme activation, proteasome biogenesis (12Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Prommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), hedgehog protein maturation (13Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. A. B.P. Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and protein splicing (14Xu M.Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A general catalytic mechanism of cis-autoproteolysis may be shared by many polypeptide main-chain modification pathways in living cells. Characterization and functional analysis of the autoprocessing active center in glycosylasparaginase should reveal the molecular mechanism of cis-autoproteolysis. This will provide valuable information for understanding these related cellular processing functions. At present, the three-dimensional structure of glycosylasparaginase precursor is not available. Identification and functional analysis of the active residues for activation based on a three-dimensional structure of the precursor is not feasible. However, both the enzyme reaction and the autoproteolysis resemble the reaction by serine/cysteine proteases, and a single hydroxyl residue, Thr-152 in the bacterial or Thr-183 in the human protein, is used as the reactive nucleophile for both the reactions. Therefore, some other residues involved in the enzymatic reaction may also be involved in the autoproteolysis. On the other hand, the two reactions are chemically different. The two active centers should also be different, both structurally and functionally, although the two active centers may share some part of their structures. For instance, the C-terminal residues of the α-subunit are essential for activation but play no roles in enzyme reaction. Therefore, in this study, not only were the residues involved in the enzyme active center analyzed, but other conserved residues that may be involved in the autoproteolysis were also under investigation. By studying in vitro autoprocessing of mutant precursors, we demonstrate that the activation of glycosylasparaginase follows the kinetics of cis-autoproteolysis. Site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro activation of purified precursors show that two residues, Arg-180 and Asp-183, which are involved in binding of substrate in the mature enzyme, are also involved in binding of free amino acids on mutant precursors. Binding of amino acid ligands on these precursors can either inhibit or stimulate their processing, depending on the individual mutants and amino acids. The results from this study suggest that Asp-151 plays an important role in activation similar to the P1 residue of substrates in protease reactions and that the partially formed substrate binding pocket on the precursor functions similarly to the S1 site of proteases. A charge interaction between Asp-151 and Arg-180 in the precursor is implicated. The data also suggest a possible His-Thr-Thr active triad in glycosylasparaginase activation. The maltose-binding protein (MBP) protein fusion expression and purification system including plasmids pMAL-c2 and pMAL-p2, the Escherichia coli host strain TB1, amylose resin, Factor Xa protease, restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA kinase, DNA polymerases, and synthesized oligonucleotides were obtained from New England Biolabs. The bacterial glycosylasparaginase clones used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. A. Tarentino (Wadsworth Laboratories, Albany, NY). The glycosylasparaginase assay was based on colorimetric measurement of N-acetylglucosamine released from the substrateN4-(β-N-acetylglucosaminyl)-l-aspartic acid (AspNHGlcNAc) (Sigma) using the Reissig modification of the Morgan-Elson reaction as described previously (11Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.M. Plummer T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 399-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). DNA manipulation and site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel methods) were carried out as described previously (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). All site-directed mutagenesis was performed using either the pMAL system or the Litmus system (New England Biolabs Inc.). DNA sequence analysis was carried out using an ABI automatic DNA sequencer. Expression and purification of gene products using the MBP fusion and expression system (15Riggs P. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. Green Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1990: 16.0.2Google Scholar) with modifications were described previously (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), except that for expression of the glycine inhibition-minus mutants such as the T152S/D183N double mutant, a lower induction temperature (15 °C, overnight) or shorter induction time (3 h, 30 °C) was used. Amylose-purified fusion proteins stored at −70 °C in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) were thawed and diluted in the same ice-cold buffer to the desired concentrations and then shifted to an appropriate temperature to start autoproteolysis. At various times, aliquots were withdrawn and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. For some Thr to Cys mutant proteins, 5 mmdithiothreitol was included in the reaction buffer to prevent oxidation during long incubations. Protein gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and protein bands were quantified by gel scanning using a Microtek Scanmaker III, Adobe Photoshop™, and NIH Image 1.57. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein Assay using bovine serum albumin as standards. N-terminal protein sequence analysis was performed on an Applied Biosystems 610A as described previously (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Molecular weight determination was carried out by SDS-PAGE analysis or electrospray mass spectrometry. The cis-autoproteolytic processing of the glycosylasparaginase proenzyme is described by the following reaction,R1­CON[N]H­R2↔k−1k1R1­COO­R2[O]→k2R1­COOHα+R2­NH2βReaction 1 where k1, k−1, and k2 are, respectively, the N-O shift rate constant, the O-N shift rate constant, and the ester intermediate hydrolysis rate constant. [N] and [O] stand for the precursor and the ester intermediate concentrations, respectively.d[N]/dt=−k1[N]+k−1[O]Equation 1 Since cis-autoproteolysis is not an enzymatic processing, the overall processing rate is constantly changing and a steady state of reaction cannot be reached. However, the experimental data indicate that the overall processing follows first-order kinetics and [O]/[N]→0. Therefore,d[N]/dt=−k[N]Equation 2 where k is the overall rate constant. Combining Equations 1 and 2, we have the following.d[N]/dt=−k1k2/(k−1+k2)[N]Equation 3 The overall rate constant k =k1 k2/(k−1 + k2) is determined by the N-O shift rate constantk1, the O-N shift rate constantk-1, and the ester hydrolysis rate constantk2. Ester hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step for the processing (In this processing, the N-O shift, O-N shift, and ester hydrolysis all are the rate determining steps. By definition, the last rate determining step, ester hydrolysis, is the rate-limiting step (16Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, Inc., 1995: 20-21Google Scholar)). When 0.25 m of hydroxylamine is used, the overall rate constant is giving by the following,k′=k1k2′/(k−1+k2′)Equation 4 where k′2 is the hydroxylaminolysis constant, givenk2′ ≫k2. If both the O-N shift rate constant k−1 and the hydroxylaminolysis (NH2OH = 0.25 m) rate constant of the ester intermediatesk2′ in the tested mutants are similar, thenk′=βk1Equation 5 where β is a constant. We have used k′ to estimate the relative N-O shift rates.k/k′=k2(k−1+k2′)/k2′(k−1+k2)Equation 6 When k−1 ≫k2, i.e. for slow ester hydrolysis mutantsk/k′=k2(1/k−1+1/k2′)=δk2Equation 7 where δ is a constant. In any case k/k′ increases as k2 increases. We have used k/k′ or τ(NH2OH)/τ(H2O) to estimate the relative ester hydrolysis rates, where τ(NH2OH) and τ(H2O) are the half processing times with and without 0.25 m NH2OH. The inhibition constant Ki of amino acid is determined as described previously (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We fused the genes of the E. coli MBP and glycosylasparaginase, termed MG, and expressed the gene fusion inE. coli. The amylose-purified MG product consists of two polypeptides. One contained a fusion between MBP and the α-subunit, termed MGα, with a molecular mass of 60 kDa. The second was the glycosylasparaginase β-subunit with a molecular mass of 15 kDa. The two polypeptides were in tight association, termed MGαβ, and co-purified on amylose resin. Protein fusions between MBP and mutant glycosylasparaginases were termed in the single-letter format for amino acids as in the following example: MBP-glycosylasparaginase(T152A) was termed MG(T152A) where 152 indicates the residue number based on wild-type glycosylasparaginase. The precursor of MG(T152X) protein was termed pre-MG(T152X), and the activated protein was termed MG(T152X)αβ. Our previous study (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) showed that pre-MG(T152C) was processed very slowly (the half activation time τ ≥ 48 h, 3 × 10−4of the rate for wild-type) because a slowly hydrolyzed thioester intermediate was involved. This intermediate could be rapidly resolved by adding the strong nucleophile hydroxylamine (NH2OH), which was highly reactive with an ester or a thioester. In the presence of 0.25 m NH2OH, the half activation time τ of pre-MG(T152C) was only about 30 min. When purified pre-MG(T152C) was first denatured with SDS followed by incubation with NH2OH, no precursor processing was observed (see Fig. 2A, lanes 1and 2). This indicated that no detectable thioester intermediate existed in the protein sample before incubation. When pre-MG(T152C) was first incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and then SDS and NH2OH were added, followed by incubation for an additional 1 h, the processing results were the same as in samples treated identically for 3 h but without SDS and NH2OH. Only about 5% of the precursor was processed (lanes 3and 4). When NH2OH was included in the reaction during incubation, more than 95% of the precursor was processed after 3 h at 37 °C (lane 5). These results indicate that although the thioester intermediate forms rather rapidly, no accumulation of the hydrolysis-resistant intermediate takes place during the autoproteolytic processing. Thus, the N-S shift step in the autoproteolysis was reversible. His-150 is the proton acceptor/donor for the autoproteolysis (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and therefore activation of pre-MG(H150S) is very slow (τ ≈ 5–7 days, compared with 1–2 min for pre-MG) because of the very slow N-O shift rate. However, the processing rates of pre-MG(H150S) could still be increased 3–5-fold when 0.25m NH2OH was added (Fig. 2 B). This rate increase was similar to that of the fast processing pre-MG(T152S) (τ ≈ 20 min without and ≈ 4 min with NH2OH). This indicates that the hydrolysis step in activation of pre-MG(H150S) is still the rate-limiting step. It cannot be reassigned from the ester hydrolysis step to the N-O shift step simply by decreasing the N-O shift rates. This mechanistically characterizes a reversible N-O shift step being involved in the autoproteolysis (16Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing, Inc., 1995: 20-21Google Scholar) (also see “Experimental Procedures”). The activation of pre-MG(T152S/C) is inhibited by small α-amino acids such as glycine and not by glycosylasparaginase substrate (AspNHGlcNAc) or inhibitor (Aspartate) (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), indicating that the amino acid binding site on these precursors is different from the substrate binding site of the mature enzyme. The location and biological function of this amino acid binding site was unknown. To address these questions, we undertook characterization of the residues involved in binding of the amino acid ligands on the precursor. Secondary mutations were introduced into the glycine-sensitive MG(T152S) mutant. We searched for suppressor mutants in which the activation was no longer inhibited by glycine. Two residues, Arg-180 and Asp-183, were identified as the suppressor mutation sites (Fig. 3). The freshly purified MG(T152S/D183N) gene product consisted of about 20% precursor and 80% processed protein. The half processing time τ of pre-MG(T152S/D183N) was about 40 min, similar to that of pre-MG(T152S) (τ ≈ 20 min). The purified MG(T152S/R180Q) was mainly precursor, and the half-processing time τ of pre-MG(T152S/R180Q) was more than 72 h. The activation of both pre-MG(T152S/D183N) and pre-MG(T152S/R180Q) was not inhibited by glycine, suggesting that Arg-180 and Asp-183 were involved in amino acid binding on the precursor. The activation of other double mutants such as MG(T152S/T170A), MG(T152S/T203A), MG(T152S/T64A), MG(T152S/D58N), and MG(T152S/C68S) were still inhibited by glycine. For example, the autoprocessing of pre-MG(T152S/T203A) was severely inhibited by 10 mm glycine (Fig. 3), suggesting that Thr-203 did not play significant roles in amino acid binding on this precursor. In serine proteases, the active triad Ser-His-Asp forms a charge relay system to increase the nucleophilic activity of the active serine and to stabilize the transitional state of the reaction (17Craik C.S. Roczniak S. Largman C. Rutter W.J. Science. 1987; 237: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). To investigate whether glycosylasparaginase activation involves a similar charge relay system, we compared the sequences of six glycosylasparaginases from different sources (7Liu Y. Dunn G.S. Aronson N.N.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and identified seven conserved aspartate residues; Asp-33, -58, -66, -71, -151, -183, and -194. Each of these seven aspartate residues was individually replaced with asparagine by site-directed mutagenesis. The freshly purified MG(D33N), MG(D58N), MG(D66N), MG(D71N), and MG(D194N) were present mainly as the processed α/β-subunit form with 0–10% of the protein presented as precursors (Fig. 4 A). The precursors were completely processed after incubation for 2–3 h at 37 °C (Fig. 4 B). These results suggest that Asp-33, -58, -66, -71, and -194 do not play significant roles in the activation. For MG(D183N), 70% of the purified protein was processed and 30% existed as pre-MG(D183N). The processing rate of pre-MG(D183N) was about 100-fold reduced (τ ≈ 2 h) relative to the wild-type. Purified MG(D183E) was already processed to MG(D183E)αβ. The enzymatic activities of MG(D183N/E)αβ were greatly reduced. Pre-MG(D151N) was not processed. Asp-151 was further replaced with different residues by site-directed mutagenesis using a synthesized DNA oligo-mixture where codon 151 was randomized. Thirteen mutations were isolated; Asp-151-Ala/Leu/Val/Met/Pro/Gly/Gln/Asn/Ser/Thr/Arg/His/Glu. All the mutant gene products were purified as precursors. Purified MG(D151E) existed mainly as pre-MG(D151E). The processing rate of pre-MG(D151E) was decreased about 1000-fold (τ ≈ 20 h). Pre-MG(D151G) was processed very slowly. Since MG(D151E/G)αβ was fully active, we were able to estimate the processing rate of pre-MG(D151G) by measuring the increase in enzyme activity. The processing rate was about 3 × 10−5 of the wild-type. All other mutants were inactive in autoprocessing. Taken together, these results indicate that Asp-151 is virtually required for activation but not for enzyme activity. Asp-183 is important for enzyme activity but not for activation. The activation in wild-type is not inhibited by free amino acids (Ki of glycine ≫ 10 mm) suggests that the amino acid binding site is covered or sequestered in the wild-type precursor. To investigate the residues that are involved in sequestering the amino acid binding site, we set out to isolate mutants whose processing rates were influenced by exogenous amino acids. Several dozen single and double mutants at 22 residues, including 16 conserved ones (Asp-33, -58, -66, -71, -107, -151, -183, and -197; His-150; Thr-64, -152, -170, and -203; Arg-180; Trp-11; Glu-97, and -121; Cys-68, -81, -168, -232, and -270) were constructed, and the gene products were analyzed. Among all of the characterized mutants, only in those mutated at His-150 or Thr-152 was the activation of the gene products inhibited by glycine (data not shown). For example, the activation of pre-MG(T152S/C) or pre-MG(H150S/K/W) was almost completely prevented by 10 mm glycine, although some of precursors were processed very slowly (Fig. 2 B). The glycine-sensitivity of activation in MG(H150X) mutants was irrelevant to the size, charge, hydropathy, and geometry of the replacement residues. The low processing rate of pre-MG(D151G) increased only slightly (2–3-fold) in the presence of 0.25 m NH2OH, indicating that a slow N-O shift step involved in the processing (see “Experimental Procedues”). Sterochemically, it is unlikely for Asp-151 to form a charge relay system with His-150 and Thr-152 because of the physical position of Asp-151. A possible role for Asp-151 is to anchor its side chain into a pocket through charge interaction to produce the correct conformation for the processing site polypeptide, i.e.Asp-151 functions similarly to the P1 residue of protease substrates. Arg-180 in the amino acid binding site of the precursor would provide an ideal site for binding Asp-151 (see Fig. 1 A). In this case, one would anticipate that the activation of pre-MG(D151G), where the acetic acid side chain of Asp-151 is replaced by a hydrogen atom, may not be inhibited by glycine since the binding pocket could fully contain the bound glycine without interfering with the processing site folding. Indeed, the processing rates of pre-MG(D151G) were actually increased about 2-fold when 10 mm glycine was presented (Fig. 5 A), although the processing rates were low. As expected, other amino acids could still inhibit the autoproteolysis to various degrees since their side chains could interfere with the processing site peptide folding over the binding pocket. The processing rates were reduced 15- to 20-fold with 10 mm threonine, aspartic acid, or histidine relative to that without free amino acids. The reduction was only 50% or less with 10 mm alanine, leucine, tyrosine, or lysine (Fig. 5 B). Autoprocessing of pre-MG(D151G) was slightly stimulated by 0.2 m sodium acetate (Fig. 5 B). We have shown that the reactive nucleophile Thr-152 for enzyme activity is also the reactive nucleophile for autoproteolysis (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Two other conserved threonine residues in the enzyme active center, Thr-170 and Thr-203 (see Fig. 1 A), were also investigated for their possible function in the activation. The purified MG(T203S) was already processed to MG(T203S)αβ, which retained 50% of the enzyme activity. The processing rate of pre-MG(T203A) was about 100–200-fold reduced (τ ≈ 3 h) relative to the wild type. MG(T203A)αβ was about 30% active. These results suggest that Thr-203 may not play essential roles either in the precursor activation or in the enzyme activity. Thr-170 was replaced with Ser, Cys, and Ala, respectively, and the activation of each mutant gene product was analyzed. The processing rate of pre-MG(T170S) was reduced 10–20-fold relative to the wild-type. The processing rates of pre-MG(T170A/C) were reduced about 1000-fold. To understand these profound effects of Thr-170 on activation, we investigated the possible interaction between Thr-170 and the reactive nucleophile Thr-152 in the precursor since x-ray analysis showed that the two corresponding residues, Thr-201 and Thr-183, in the human enzyme were in hydrogen bond interaction (see Fig. 1 A). Single and double mutants were constructed and analyzed. The results are summarized in Table I. These results showed the following. (a) The processing rates in the mutants that contained both hydroxyl residues at position 152 and 170 were considerably faster than in the mutants that lacked hydroxyl residues at one or both of these positions. (b) Comparing the k′ values, which indicated the N-O or N-S shift rates (see “Experimental Procedures”), among the different mutants showed that the lower processing rates in T170A/C single or in T152S/T170A/C double mutants were due to lower N-O shift rates since the relative hydrolysis rates (k/k′) for these mutants were actually the same (0.2–0.3) (T170A was an exception, thek/k′ = 0.04). (c) The processing rates in T152C and T152C/T170A/C/S were slow but could be greatly accelerated by adding NH2OH (k/k′ = 0.01–0.03). In contrast to N-O shifts in mutants with hydroxyl 152, the N-S shift rates in mutants with thiol 152 became independent of the presence of a hydroxyl group on residue 170. As a whole, the results showed that the presence of both hydroxyl residues 152 and 170 was required for the efficient activation and maintenance of the enzyme activity.Table IProcessing rates and enzyme activities of threonine mutantsMutantProcessing constantEnzyme activitykk′k/k′min−1WT6.9 × 10−1NANA100T170S5.0 × 10−22.3 × 10−10.2100T170C1.2 × 10−35.8 × 10−30.20.5T170A2.3 × 10−45.8 × 10−30.040.1T152S3.5 × 10−21.7 × 10−10.25T152S/T170S3.5 × 10−21.7 × 10−10.2NAT152S/T170C4.8 × 10−41.4 × 10−30.30T152S/T170A2.3 × 10−47.2 × 10−40.30T152C2.3 × 10−42.3 × 10−20.010T152C/T170S9.5 × 10−43.5 × 10−20.030T152C/T170C2.3 × 10−42.3 × 10−20.010T152C/T170A2.3 × 10−47.7 × 10−30.030 Open table in a new tab The experimental data from in vitro activation of glycosylasparaginase indicate that activation of glycosylasparaginase is an intramolecular autoproteolytic event (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the experimental results from analysis of the mammalian 20 S proteasome biogenesis are consistent with a cis-autoproteolysis model (12Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Prommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a study on autocatalytic processing of the 20 S proteasome from Thermoplasma acidophilum suggests that this processing is probably intermolecular (18Seemuller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, more studies on the autoprocessing mechanism in different Ntn-enzymes are needed to determine if there is a common one for their activation. In this study we characterized the autoprocessing catalytic center of glycosylasparaginase. The results provided further evidence for cis-autoproteolytic processing of this Ntn-hydrolase. Two types of intramolecular autoproteolysis have been reported. In the first type, the active hydroxyl or thiol residue attacks a distant peptide carbonyl on the same polypeptide to initiate autoproteolytic processing. Autocleavage of LexA repressor is an example of this type of reaction. This intramolecular processing has been successfully converted to an intermolecular one by genetic manipulation (19Kim B. Little J.B. Cell. 1993; 73: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 20Little J.W. J. Bacteriology. 1993; 175: 4943-4950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the second type, or so-called cis-autoproteolysis, the active nucleophile attacks the carbonyl at its N-terminal side (−1 carbonyl) to start the processing. Activation of glycosylasparaginase is such a cis-autoproteolytic processing. Cis-autoproteolytic processing is not enzymatic but instead is a catalyzed chemical reaction. In contrast to proteolysis by serine/cysteine proteases, in cis-autoproteolysis, formation of the ester or thioester intermediate via an N-O or N-S shift is a reversible step. The released amino group cannot diffuse from the catalytic center and therefore is ready to attack the ester carbonyl to restore the peptide linkage. The equilibrium is favorable for peptide bond formation via an O-N or S-N shift (21Shao Y. Paulus H. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 22Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3173) Google Scholar), and therefore no significant amounts of ester or thioester intermediates are accumulated in slow ester hydrolysis mutants. The overall rate of cis-autoproteolysis is determined not only by the N-O or N-S shift rate but also by the O-N or S-N reverse shift rate and the hydrolysis rate of the ester intermediate. The hydrolysis of the ester intermediate is the rate-limiting step. The overall processing follows first-order kinetics. The transitional tetrahedral intermediate engaged by cis-autoproteolysis is shared by many post-translational modification pathways in living cells such as autocleavage (23van Poelje P.D. Snell E.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), autoproteolysis (13Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. A. B.P. Nature. 1995; 374: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), protein splicing (14Xu M.Q. Southworth M.W. Mersha F.B. Hornstra L.J. Perler F.B. Cell. 1993; 75: 1371-1377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and formation of oxazole and thiazole structures (24Li Y.M. Milne J.C. Madison L.L. Kolter R. Walsh C.T. Science. 1996; 274: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this study, two residues, Arg-180 and Asp-183, were identified as being involved in binding of amino acids such as glycine to certain mutant precursors. The enzyme Km values in R180Q and D183N mutants were greatly increased (27Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure analysis showed that two corresponding residues, Arg-211 and Asp-214, in human glycosylasparaginase were involved in binding of the α-carboxyl and the α-amino group, respectively, of the aspartic acid as product co-crystallized in the enzyme active center (8Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1102-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). Thus, our original suggestion that the amino acid binding site found on the precursor is the partially formed substrate binding pocket for the enzyme has now been proven (9Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C.-L. Comb D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mutations at His-150/Asp-151/Thr-152 were able to produce amino acid-sensitive mutants (Figs. 2 B, 3, and 5), suggesting that this processing site tripeptide is involved in sequestering the amino acid binding site on the wild-type precursor. Mutations at His-150, disregarding the size, charge, hydropathy, and geometry of the replacement residues (Ser, Lys, or Trp), produced the same glycine-sensitive gene products, suggesting that His-150 may specifically interact with another residue, most likely Thr-152, to prevent free amino acids from access to the binding site rather than directly interfering with the amino acid binding. This is also consistent with the fact that His-150/Thr-152 is the active base/nucleophile pair for autoproteolysis. For a hydroxyl or thiol side chain to attack the adjacent −1 carbonyl carbon, certain Ramachandran angles around the cleavage site dipeptide are required. Replacement of Asp-151 with a non-acidic residue other than glycine resulted in an inactive precursor because an incorrectly folded processing site may result. Pre-MG(D151G) could slowly undergo the autoproteolysis because a side chain-free residue, Gly-151, may fit into the correct processing site conformation with less free energy costs than other non-acidic residues. This is consistent with the fact that glycine residues are frequently found at −1 position in many similar bioprocessing systems (12Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Prommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 13Porter J.A. von Kessler D.P. Ekker S.C. Young K.E. Lee J.J. Moses K. A. B.P.

Science. 1996; 274: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Among the seven conserved aspartate residues of glycosylasparaginase, only mutations at Asp-151 produced profound effects on activation (Fig. 4). The experimental data suggest that Asp-151 most likely plays a role in the activation similarly to the P1 residue of substrate in the reaction by trypsin, where the interaction between the P1 residue of substrate and the S1 site of the enzyme is the primary determinant in the enzyme-substrate binding. We proposed that Asp-151 side chain was anchored into the partially formed substrate pocket (the S1 site) by interacting with Arg-180. Possible interaction between the −1 residue and the substrate pocket was also suggested in an attempt to account for proenzyme activation in Ntn-hydrolases solely based on their unusual folding (5Brannigan J.A. Dogson G. Duggledy H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). But the experimental evidence was lacking. On the other hand, based on our hypothesis, the molecular mechanism for inhibition of the activation by amino acids can be well explained. Binding of an amino acid would interrupt the interaction between Asp-151 and Arg-180 and displace the side chain of Asp-151 from the pocket, and this would introduce conformation change and abolish the autoproteolysis. This hypothesis is further supported by the following facts. 1) Mutations at Arg-180 caused significant reductions in the processing rates and often resulted in misfolded precursors (25Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2954-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Liu Y. Guan C. Aronson Jr., N.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9688-9694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), while mutations at Asp-183 did not profoundly affect the activation. 2) The partially formed substrate pocket on the wild precursor was sequestered by the processing site His-150/Asp-151/Thr-152 tripeptide. 3) Asp-151 was virtually required for activation. 4) Instead of inhibition of the activation, glycine actually stimulated the activation of pre-MG(D151G) (Fig. 5), which is very similar to the observation that methylamine inhibits trypsin hydrolysis of specific substrates and stimulates the enzyme activity toward nonspecific substrates (26Vajda T. Szabo T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 85: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This also suggested that the charge interaction between Asp-151 and Arg-180 had a role in keeping the correct conformation of the precursor. As predicted, other amino acids were still able to inhibit the activation of pre-MG(D151G) as long as they could access the binding site. The experimental data showed that the N-S shift rates of pre-MG(T152C) and pre-MG(T152C/T170A/C) were similar (Table I), which indicated that hydroxyl 170 was unlikely to take part in stabilization of the oxyanion at the transitional state of autoproteolysis. Thus, the fact that the N-O shift rates in the mutants with hydroxyl residue 170 are significantly higher than in the mutants with non-hydroxyl residue 170 may suggest that hydrogen bonding between the two hydroxyl residues 152 and 170 also exists in the precursor and plays an important role to increase the nucleophilic activity of Thr-152. The N-S shift rates in the mutants with thiol residue 152 were independent of hydroxyl 170 because thiol group hydrogen bonds poorly. Tacking all available experimental data together, we proposed a model for the interactions of functional side chains involved in glycosylasparaginase activation as illustrated in Fig. 6. In a properly folded precursor, the polypeptide chain at the processing site adopts a specific conformation that makes possible the functional interactions between active side chains and allows the occurrence of an efficient N-O shift between Asp-151 and Thr-152. Thr-152 is activated not only by deprotonation by His-150, but may also by interaction with Thr-170. The side chain of Asp-151 is anchored into the partially formed substrate pocket, possibly through a charge interaction with Arg-180. This interaction helps to stabilize the processing site conformation. Arg-180 and Asp-183 in the partially formed substrate pocket are involved in binding of free amino acids to sensitive mutant precursors. Binding an amino acid to this site will displace the Asp-151 side chain from the pocket and thereby block autoproteolysis. In the wild-type precursor, interaction between His-150 and Thr-152 prevents free amino acids from binding to this site. Because formation of the ester intermediate via an N-O shift is a reversible reaction, with the equilibrium favoring the peptide bond formation, an efficient ester hydrolysis step is essential for this cis-autoproteolysis. Glycosylasparaginase activation provides a unique example that one catalytic center can be converted to another with different activity in a single protein through main chain modification and conformation change. X-ray three-dimensional structure analysis on the properly folded precursor should be able to reveal the detail conformation changes in this conversion.

We initiated a series of experiments to examine the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating AChE expression during hematopoiesis. Differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells using dimethyl sulfoxide resulted in a 5- and 10-fold increase in intracellular and secreted AChE enzyme activity, respectively. Interestingly, these increases resulted from a preferential induction of the globular molecular form G1 and a slight increase in G4 instead of an increase in the levels of the G2 membrane-bound form, a molecular form expressed in mature erythrocytes. Concomitantly, expression of the two predominant AChE transcripts (R and T, for read-through and tail, respectively) in MEL cells was induced to a similar extent with differentiation. Nuclear run-on assays performed with nuclei isolated from inducedversus uninduced MEL cells revealed that in contrast to the large increases seen in the transcription of the β-globin gene, the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene remained largely unaffected after differentiation. Determination of the half-lives of the R and T transcripts demonstrated that they both exhibited an increase in stability in induced MEL cells. Taken together, results from these studies indicate that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms account for the increased expression of AChE in differentiated hematopoietic cells.

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 1The abbreviations used are: AChE, acetylcholinesterase; A, asymmetric; G, globular; MEL, murine erythroleukemia; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; T, tail; H, hydrophobic; R, read-through. is responsible for inactivating acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses in both central and peripheral nervous systems. This enzyme displays a rich polymorphism because it exists as a variety of molecular forms that may be classified as either homomeric or heteromeric on the basis of their association with specialized structural subunits (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Homomeric forms include the globular (G)1 monomer and G2 dimer as well as a glycophospholipid-linked dimer. Conversely, heteromers consist of the asymmetric forms A4, A8, or A12 in which one, two, or three soluble G4tetramers attach to a collagenic structural subunit, respectively; and amphiphilic tetramers G4-linked to a 20-kDa hydrophobic anchor. Although the functional significance of this polymorphism is still elusive, it has been suggested that it allows the placement of catalytically active subunits in distinct cell types and subcellular locations to perform site-specific functions. In mammals, for example, the asymmetric forms of AChE are expressed exclusively in differentiated muscle and neuronal cells, whereas glycophospholipid-linked dimers are found preferentially in tissues of hematopoietic origin. Such varied patterns of expression suggest that expression of AChE involves several levels of regulatory mechanisms ranging from tissue-specific transcriptional control to highly regulated post-translational events. An interesting feature of AChE is that its expression is indeed not restricted to cholinergic tissues. In fact, its presence in non-cholinergic cells such as specific neuronal populations (2Landwehrmeyer B. Probst A. Palacois J.M. Mengod G.

Haematol. 1982; 50: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has led to the proposal that AChE may participate in additional cellular functions distinct from its well known catalytic activity (for review, see Ref. 8Layer P.G. Willbold E. Prog. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 29: 1-94PubMed Google Scholar). For example, converging lines of evidence indicate that the process of terminal differentiation in specific lineages of hematopoietic cells is accompanied by large increases in the levels of AChE activity (see Ref.9Paoletti F. Mocali A. Vannucchi A.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that AChE may participate directly in the regulation of bone marrow cell development by reducing the proliferative and expansive capacity of pluripotent stem cells committed to erythropoiesis, megakaryopoiesis, and macrophage production and by promoting apoptosis in their progenies (10Soreq H.

Finally, deletion of the AChE locus at 7q22 has been shown to be associated with both myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, suggesting that AChE may in fact act as a tumor suppressor gene (14Ehrlich G.

Leukemia Res. 1996; 20: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In light of these recent findings, it becomes important to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms presiding over AChE expression in hematopoietic cells since it may provide additional insights into its physiological function in this cell type. Additionally, a thorough understanding of these mechanisms in skeletal muscle as well as in neuronal and hematopoietic cells will not only contribute to our knowledge of the regulatory mechanisms controlling tissue-specific expression of AChE, but it should also lead to the elucidation of the factors implicated in its highly controlled developmental regulation. The goal of the present study was to examine the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating AChE expression during the differentiation of hematopoietic cells. We initiated our studies using murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells because they can be induced easily to undergo terminal hematopoietic differentiation accompanied by hemoglobinization after exposure to inducing agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (16Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 419-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This cell line represents an excellent model with which to study AChE expression during hematopoiesis because induced cells are known to express high levels of AChE compared with their uninduced counterparts (9Paoletti F. Mocali A. Vannucchi A.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Conscience J.F. Miller R.A. Henry J. Ruddle F.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 105: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Friend MEL cells were grown in suspension in minimum essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Differentiation of these cells was induced by adding 1.5% Me2SO to the medium. The number of cells was determined using a hemocytometer. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion test. Extraction of intracellular AChE was performed on cells washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 350–700 μl of a high salt detergent buffer containing antiproteolytic agents (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0; 10 mm EDTA; 1 m NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 1.0 mg/ml bacitracin; 2.5 mg/ml aprotinin). The cells were homogenized for 30 s with a Polytron and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at −80 °C for further analysis. To assay for secreted AChE, MEL cells were cultured in medium containing serum in which endogenous esterase activity was inhibited by treatment with diisopropyl fluorophosphate as described except for some modifications (18Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal bovine serum was incubated with 0.1 mmdiisopropyl fluorophosphate overnight at room temperature on a rocking platform. The treated serum was then filter sterilized and left at 4 °C for 10 days at which point less than 1% of the original AChE activity remained. The treated serum displayed no inhibitory activity toward exogenously added AChE or toward cell growth and differentiation. Total AChE activity was determined using a modified version of the spectrophotometric method of Ellman (19Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21513) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10−5m tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, which inhibits nonspecific cholinesterases as described previously (20Jasmin B.J. Gisiger V. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 1444-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specific AChE activity was monitored by comparing substrate hydrolysis in the absence or presence of the AChE-specific inhibitor 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)-pentan-3-one dibromide. Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic (BCA) assay kit. The content of AChE molecular forms in induced versusuninduced cells and in the growth medium was determined by velocity sedimentation as described in detail elsewhere (18Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J.

Briefly, 100-μl samples were layered onto 5–20% linear sucrose gradients containing either Triton X-100 or Brij-96. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 16 h at 4 °C. Approximately 45 fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes and assayed for AChE activity. Peaks of activity corresponding to distinct molecular forms were identified according to the nomenclature of Bon et al. (21Bon S. Vigny M. Massoulié J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2546-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) on the basis of their apparent sedimentation coefficients. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellets were then dissolved in 1.0 ml of Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol washes, RNA pellets were redissolved in an appropriate volume of RNase-free water. 100–1,000 ng of total RNA was subsequently reverse transcribed to generate cDNAs. The reverse transcription mixture contained 5 mm MgCl2, 1 × PCR buffer II (50 mm KCl; 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3), 1 mm dNTPs, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 50 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, and 2.5 μmrandom hexamer primers. Negative controls consisted of reverse transcription mixtures in which RNA was replaced by RNase-free water. To amplify AChE cDNAs, synthetic primers required for selective amplification of the T, H, and R transcripts were used (22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PCR assays were performed as described previously in detail (23Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Michel R.N. Vu C.Q. Tetzlaff W. Jasmin B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of the reverse transcribed sample was added to 20 μl of a PCR mixture containing 0.3125 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, a 1.5 mm concentration of each of the appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers, and MgCl2 and PCR buffer II at final concentrations of 2 mm and 1 ×, respectively. The PCR conditions involved denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min and primer annealing and extension at 72 °C for 3 min for 30–50 cycles. PCR products were visualized using either 1 or 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and quantitated using 1.5% agarose gels containing VistraGreen (Amersham). The relative amounts of PCR products were quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics; Sunnyvale, CA). For quantitation of the relative abundance of the AChE transcripts, PCR analyses of reverse transcribed samples from MEL cell RNA were performed in parallel with serial dilutions of an external standard control plasmid designated as C5 which contains an engineered AChE cDNA with a deletion (kindly provided by Dr. Claire Legay; for details, see Ref. 22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The amount of AChE transcripts was determined by comparing the intensity of the PCR product from MEL cell samples against a standard curve generated from the quantitative analysis of PCR products using serial dilutions of the control plasmid. We previously used a similar approach to quantitate the amount of AChE mRNA at the avian neuromuscular junction (see Ref. 23Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To assess the stability of the various AChE transcripts, actinomycin D (5 μm) or 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (20 μg/ml) was used to inhibit transcription in day 2 uninduced and induced MEL cell cultures. Total RNA was extracted from these samples at different time intervals thereafter and analyzed by RT-PCR. Two × 106 MEL cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended, and lysed in 10 ml of cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 10 mm NaCl; 3 mm MgCl2; 0.2% Nonidet P-40) by vortexing for 10 s and incubating them on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were then sedimented by centrifugation at 850 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and subsequently washed twice in lysis buffer. Nuclei pellets thus obtained were resuspended in 400 μl of freezing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 40% glycerol; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.1 mm EDTA) and used immediately or stored in liquid nitrogen. Run-on transcription assays were performed as described in Chanet al. (25Chan R.Y.-Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). [α-32P]UTP (200 μCi) was used to label nascent transcripts for 30 min at 27 °C. After DNase I digestion and protein denaturation, radiolabeled RNA was extracted using Trizol and hybridized to filters containing 10 μg of immobilized cDNAs encoding AChE, β-globin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The intensity of the radioactive signals was quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager. All values were standardized according to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as an internal standard, because transcriptional rates of this gene have been shown previously to remain unchanged during differentiation of MEL cells (25Chan R.Y.-Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After a 3-day exposure to Me2SO, differentiation of MEL cells could be confirmed easily by examining their striking red color caused by the accumulation of hemoglobin (data not shown). Compared with uninduced control cells, expression of AChE was increased dramatically in induced MEL cells (Fig. 1). In fact, intracellular and secreted AChE activity increased by approximately 5- and 10-fold, respectively, in induced cells (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, it also appears that in both uninduced and induced MEL cells, more than 80% of the total enzyme activity was actually in the growth medium, indicating that these cells secrete large amounts of AChE. Unlike differentiating neuronal cells (18Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the proportion of enzyme secreted remained unchanged during hematopoietic differentiation of MEL cells. To determine whether differentiation was accompanied by selective increases in the amount of specific molecular forms, we separated by velocity sedimentation using sucrose gradients aliquots of the cell extracts and growth media obtained from both uninduced and induced MEL cells and measured the AChE enzyme activity in each fraction. As shown in Fig. 2, A and C, uninduced MEL cell extract and media contained only a small amount of the monomeric G1 species of AChE. By contrast, we detected in induced cell extracts high levels of G1 together with moderate amounts of G4 (Fig. 2 B). In these experiments, we also observed a high level of G1 in the medium of induced MEL cells (Fig. 2 D). Together, these results indicate that the large increases in cell-associated and secreted total AChE enzyme activity are accounted for by selective increases in the levels of the globular forms of AChE. In separate experiments, we also determined the amphiphilic character of the G1 monomers expressed by these cells using sucrose gradients containing Brij-96. Although essentially all monomers present in the media appeared non-amphiphilic (data not shown), we observed routinely that approximately half of the cell-associated G1molecular form in either uninduced or induced cells displayed a reduced sedimentation coefficient thereby highlighting their amphiphilic nature (Fig. 2, E and F). On the basis of these results, it appears that both uninduced and induced MEL cells express two pools of AChE monomers. We next examined whether the increase in AChE enzyme activity which occurs during the differentiation of MEL cells was accompanied by increases in the levels of AChE mRNA. Although AChE is encoded by a single gene, three transcripts designated T, H, and R are generated by alternative splicing (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 26Taylor P. Radic Z. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 281-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). We employed RT-PCR using specific primers that amplify individual transcripts selectively to determine their relative abundance (22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For these experiments, AChE mRNA levels in uninduced and induced MEL cells were examined at 24-h intervals over 4 days. During MEL cell differentiation, the levels of both T and R transcripts increased steadily from day 1 to 3 (Fig. 3 A). Despite the sensitivity of these PCR assays, we detected extremely low levels of the H transcript in uninduced MEL cells as reported previously by Li et al. (27Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, differentiation did not increase expression of this transcript significantly. As shown in Figs.3 B and 4, however, expression of both T and R transcripts increased in induced MEL cells.Figure 4Quantitation of AChE T and R transcript levels by RT-PCR. Serial dilutions of the control plasmid (C5) that contained an engineered AChE cDNA were amplified in parallel with reverse-transcribed cDNAs from uninduced and induced MEL cells for 35 and 34 cycles for the quantitation of the T (panel A) and R (panel B) transcripts, respectively. Note that 1 μg of total RNA from MEL cell samples was used for quantitation of the T transcripts, whereas 0.1 μg was used for the R. Shown are ethidium bromide-stained gels of PCR products amplified from the C5 plasmid (numbers denote the number of copies used) and from uninduced (U) and induced (I) MEL cell samples. For quantitation, aliquots of the same samples were electrophoresed in agarose gels containing VistraGreen and scanned using a Storm PhosphorImager. Data obtained from the serial dilutions were plotted as standard curves (amount of C5 plasmid versus PCR signal);arrows indicate the levels of the transcripts in uninduced and induced MEL cells. Note that the level of both transcripts increased by approximately 3-fold. These results are representative examples obtained from four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To compare the relative abundance of the T and R transcripts in uninduced and induced MEL cells, we determined the absolute amount of each mRNA in day 3 samples by quantitative RT-PCR using the external C5 control plasmid (see Ref. 22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using 1 μg of total RNA (analysis of 1 μg of total RNA was necessary to visualize the PCR products corresponding to the T transcript in ethidium bromide-stained gels), we observed that in uninduced MEL cells there was approximately 1.1 × 105 copies of AChE T mRNA (Fig. 4). Similar experiments revealed that 0.1 μg of total RNA from uninduced cells contained 0.18 × 105 copies of AChE R transcripts, indicating that as observed previously by RNase protection assays (27Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the R transcript is slightly more abundant than the T mRNA in uninduced MEL cells when values are corrected for total RNA. As shown in this figure, differentiation increased the expression of both transcripts by approximately 3-fold without affecting the ratio of Tversus R transcripts significantly. In agreement with previous findings obtained with muscle fibers (see Ref. 23Jasmin B.J. Lee R.K. Rotundo R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 467-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), these experiments also indicated that both AChE mRNAs are rare to moderately abundant transcripts in MEL cells. There is currently little information concerning the transcriptional regulation of the AChE gene in hematopoietic cells. However, the presence of a consensus binding site for GATA-1, a transcription factor important for erythroid and megakaryocytic development, has been identified in the upstream regulatory regions of both rat (29Chan R.Y.-Y. Jasmin B.J. Soc. Neurosci. 1995; 21 (abstr.): 800Google Scholar) and human (30Ben Aziz-Aloya R. Seidman S. Timberg R. Sternfeld M. Zakut H. Soreq H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2471-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) AChE genes. In separate experiments we examined whether the increase in AChE mRNAs which occurs in differentiating MEL cells was caused by a concomitant increase in the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene. Nuclear run-on assays performed with nuclei isolated from MEL cells at day 3 showed, as expected (see Ref. 25Chan R.Y.-Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), a large 10-fold increase in the transcriptional activity of the β-globin gene in inducedversus uninduced cells (Fig. 5). By contrast, these experiments demonstrated that transcription of the AChE gene remained largely unaffected in differentiated MEL cells. Consistent with previous observations (see Ref. 31Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), approximately 75% of the AChE signal was attributed to nascent transcripts bound to antisense cDNAs. Control experiments using α-amanitin inhibited transcription in both directions, indicating that AChE mRNA synthesis resulted primarily from the activity of the RNA polymerase II (data not shown). Together these findings show that the increased AChE mRNA levels seen in induced cells do not result from an enhancement in the transcriptional activity of the AChE gene. Increases in the levels of AChE mRNA in induced MEL cells may have also occurred via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. We therefore examined whether differentiation of MEL cells was accompanied by an increase in the stability of AChE transcripts. For these experiments we inhibited the activity of the RNA polymerase II by adding actinomycin D to the media of uninduced and 2-day induced cells and measured the levels of T and R transcripts, the predominant species of AChE mRNA in MEL cells. Total RNA was extracted at different time intervals thereafter, and the levels of these two transcripts were determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, the half-lives of the R and T transcripts were only 4.1 ± 0.9 h (n = 3) and 4.5 ± 1.5 h (n = 3), respectively. As expected on the basis of our nuclear run-on assays, the stability of both AChE transcripts increased markedly in induced MEL cells. In separate experiments, we observed a similar effect on the stabilization of the R and T transcripts using 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside (data not shown). It is well established that AChE is expressed in hematopoietic cells and that significant changes in total enzyme activity accompany the process of terminal hematopoietic differentiation. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the expression of AChE in hematopoietic cells as well as its induction during differentiation. We employed MEL cells as a model system to begin addressing these issues. In the present study we focused on the pattern of AChE molecular forms and the different transcripts expressed during hematopoiesis as well as on the relative contribution of transcriptional versus post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the overall induction of AChE activity. Exposure of MEL cells to Me2SO, an inducer of differentiation, resulted in large increases in cell-associated and secreted AChE activity as described previously (9Paoletti F. Mocali A. Vannucchi A.M. Blood. 1992; 79: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Conscience J.F. Miller R.A. Henry J. Ruddle F.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 105: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these changes in AChE expression were accounted for mostly by dramatic increases in the levels of G1 rather than by changes in the amount of the membrane-bound, glycophospholipid-linked G2dimer, which is highly expressed in mature erythrocytes (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Because uninduced and induced MEL cells are equivalent to erythroblasts and normoblasts, respectively, which are early erythroid precursors residing in the bone marrow (32Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar), our data suggest that expression of monomeric AChE is probably a characteristic feature in less mature hematopoietic cells. In support of this hypothesis, histochemical staining of normoblasts has revealed previously the presence of AChE activity inside the cells rather than on the cell surface (33Koekebakker M. Barr R.D. Am. J. Hematol. 1988; 28: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies of immature human megakaryocytes showed that AChE is located intracellularly (34Lev-Lehman E. Deutsch V. Eldor A. Soreq H. Blood. 1997; 89: 3644-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During MEL cell differentiation, the increases in AChE activity were accompanied by significant increases in the levels of AChE transcripts as revealed by our RT-PCR analysis. Although AChE is transcribed by a single gene, alternative exon usage achieved by differential splicing gives rise to three distinct transcripts designated T, H, and R. Previous studies have shown that the T transcript is the only splice variant expressed in adult muscle (22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and arises from splicing of exon 4 to 6. Alternatively, the H transcript results from splicing of exon 4 to 5 and appears exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, whereas the R transcript results from reading through the splice donor site of exon 4 into the subsequent genomic sequence (see Refs. 1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar and 26Taylor P. Radic Z. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 281-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous findings (27Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we observed in uninduced MEL cells that approximately 60% of the total AChE mRNA corresponded to the R transcript, and the remaining portion consisted mostly of the T mRNA. Because levels of these transcripts are controlled by their rate of synthesis and degradation, our data showing a similar half-life for both of these transcripts in uninduced MEL cells suggest that the synthesis of the R transcript is likely occurring at a slightly faster rate. It is therefore possible that although transcription of the AChE gene provides precursor mRNA molecules for the formation of all AChE transcripts, splicing from exon 4 to 6 needed for T transcript maturation is a less preferred splicing pathway in uninduced MEL cells. Because the H transcript is barely detectable in these cells (see Refs.27Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 28Li Y. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5790-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and this study), the splicing from exon 4 to 5 necessary for its maturation appears as the least used option for alternative splicing of immature AChE mRNA. This particular mode of splicing likely persists during MEL cell differentiation as the ratio of R to T transcripts remained essentially unchanged in induced MEL cells despite the increases in the levels of both species of AChE transcripts. Interestingly, this splicing pattern is possibly not limited to early erythroid precursors such as uninduced and induced MEL cells. It may in fact extend to most early hematopoietic precursor cells because RNase protection assays showed previously that the splicing pattern of AChE mRNA in MEL cells was similar to that in the bone marrow (27Li Y. Camp S. Rachinsky T.L. Getman D. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23083-23090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains a pool of immature hematopoietic cells. Because the H transcript encodes the glycophospholipid-linked dimer of AChE which is expressed abundantly in mature erythrocytes (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F.-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar), the low level of this transcript in both uninduced and induced MEL cells suggests that the splicing event necessary for synthesis of this transcript is likely activated at a later stage of hematopoietic differentiation. Accordingly, this hypothesis raises the possibilities that (i) differential splicing of AChE mRNA is regulated developmentally in erythropoietic tissues as observed previously in skeletal muscle (22Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J. Changeux J.-P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 1803-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and (ii) specific molecular forms of AChE which are destined to distinct subcellular locations are required at different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. It will thus be interesting to examine whether the H transcript is more prevalent than the other AChE transcripts in more mature erythroid elements such as reticulocytes. In both uninduced and induced MEL cells, more than 80% of the total AChE enzyme activity corresponded to non-amphiphilic monomers secreted in the medium. Interestingly, the R transcript that encodes this monomeric species was only slightly more abundant than the T mRNA. Therefore, these results suggest that the R transcript may be translated more efficiently than the T mRNA. Alternatively, it is also possible that the secreted AChE, unlike intracellular AChE, is not subjected to degradation by the normal protein turnover machinery operating inside the cells. To date, the molecular mechanisms regulating AChE gene expression have been studied mostly in cultured muscle (31Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 35Luo Z. Fuentes M.-E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27216-27223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and neuronal cells (18Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the C2 myogenic cell line, it has been demonstrated that the increase in the levels of AChE mRNA accompanying the fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated myotubes results primarily from an increase in the stability of existing transcripts as opposed to a transcriptional activation of the AChE gene (31Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similarly, post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms have also been suggested to account for the large induction in the levels of AChE mRNA in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells induced to differentiate into neuronal and glial cells (18Coleman B.A. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4410-4416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Using MEL cells as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the increase in AChE expression during hematopoiesis, we show in the present study that the observed increase in AChE mRNA levels also results primarily from an increase in the stability of existing transcripts. Thus, post-transcriptional mechanisms, operating at the level of transcript stability, appear as a major regulatory step dictating levels of AChE mRNA in all cell types known to express significant amounts of this enzyme. However, despite the apparent role of these post-transcriptional mechanisms in the control of AChE levels in various cell types, it is still of considerable interest to examine the relative contribution of specific AChE promoter elements to the transcriptional regulation of the AChE gene, particularly as it pertains to tissue-specific expression. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence indicating that the stability of mRNA plays a crucial role in the basic mechanisms underlying gene expression (for review, see Refs. 36Greenberg M.E. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1993: 199-219Crossref Google Scholar and 37Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Such regulatory mechanisms involve not only distinct cytoplasmic factors but also the contribution of sequence determinants lying both within and outside the coding regions of mature transcripts. On the basis of our data it appears that the predominantly expressed AChE transcripts become stabilized during hematopoiesis, thereby raising the possibility of a general decrease in the activity of an endonuclease in induced MEL cells. This mechanism can be ruled out, however, because our previous studies have shown that the stability of the housekeeping actin mRNA is not affected following differentiation of MEL cells (25Chan R.Y.-Y. Seiser C. Schulman H.M. Ponka P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar); thus, increased AChE mRNA stability appears to be a specific event accompanying hematopoietic differentiation. In muscle cells undergoing differentiation, the influx of Ca2+ via L-type channels has been linked to the increased stability of AChE transcripts (35Luo Z. Fuentes M.-E. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27216-27223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although L-type Ca2+ channels have not been found in MEL cells, a surge of intracellular Ca2+ occurs in these cells after exposure to Me2SO (38Morley P. Whitfield J.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 has been shown to induce an early and transient decrease in the levels of c-myb mRNA whose regulation has been implicated in the control of hematopoietic growth and differentiation (13Schaefer A. Magócsi M. Stöcker U. Kósa F. Marquardt H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8786-8791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be established whether Ca2+ does play a direct role in controlling AChE mRNA stability in hematopoietic cells. In differentiating C2 cells, an increase in AChE mRNA levels after protein synthesis inhibition has led to the suggestion that some labile proteins are involved in the destabilization of AChE mRNAs (31Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Therefore, uninduced MEL cells may provide an interesting model in the search of destabilizing proteins specific for AChE mRNAs.

https://openalex.org/W2008480577,"Helodermin and exendin-4, two peptides isolated from the salivary gland of the Gila monster,Heloderma suspectum, are approximately 50% homologous to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively, and interact with the mammalian receptors for VIP and GLP-1 with equal or higher affinity and efficacy. Immunohistochemical studies suggested the presence of helodermin-like peptides in mammals. To determine whether helodermin and exendin-4 are present in mammals and their evolutionary relationship to VIP and GLP-1, their cDNAs were first cloned from Gila monster salivary gland. Northern blots and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of multiple Gila monster tissues identified ∼500-base pair transcripts only from salivary gland. Both helodermin and exendin-4 full-length cDNAs were ∼500 base pairs long, and they encoded precursor proteins containing the entire amino acid sequence of helodermin and exendin-4, as well as a 44- or 45-amino acid N-terminal extension peptide, respectively, having ∼60% homology. The size and structural organization of these cDNAs indicated that they were closely related to one another but markedly different from known cDNAs for the VIP/GLP-1 peptide family previously identified in both lower and higher evolved species. Cloning of the Gila monster VIP/peptide histidine isoleucine, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide, and glucagon/GLP-1 cDNAs and Southern blotting of Gila monster DNA demonstrate the coexistence of separate genes for these peptides and suggests, along with the restricted salivary gland expression, that helodermin and exendin-4 coevolved to serve a separate specialized function. Probing of a variety of rat and human tissues on Northern blots, human and rat Southern blots, and genomic and cDNA libraries with either helodermin- or exendin-4-specific cDNAs failed to identify evidence for mammalian homologues. These data indicate that helodermin and exendin-4 are not the precursors to VIP and GLP-1 and that they belong to a separate peptide family encoded by separate genes. Furthermore, the existence of as yet undiscovered mammalian homologues to helodermin and exendin-4 seems unlikely. Helodermin and exendin-4, two peptides isolated from the salivary gland of the Gila monster,Heloderma suspectum, are approximately 50% homologous to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), respectively, and interact with the mammalian receptors for VIP and GLP-1 with equal or higher affinity and efficacy. Immunohistochemical studies suggested the presence of helodermin-like peptides in mammals. To determine whether helodermin and exendin-4 are present in mammals and their evolutionary relationship to VIP and GLP-1, their cDNAs were first cloned from Gila monster salivary gland. Northern blots and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of multiple Gila monster tissues identified ∼500-base pair transcripts only from salivary gland. Both helodermin and exendin-4 full-length cDNAs were ∼500 base pairs long, and they encoded precursor proteins containing the entire amino acid sequence of helodermin and exendin-4, as well as a 44- or 45-amino acid N-terminal extension peptide, respectively, having ∼60% homology. The size and structural organization of these cDNAs indicated that they were closely related to one another but markedly different from known cDNAs for the VIP/GLP-1 peptide family previously identified in both lower and higher evolved species. Cloning of the Gila monster VIP/peptide histidine isoleucine, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide, and glucagon/GLP-1 cDNAs and Southern blotting of Gila monster DNA demonstrate the coexistence of separate genes for these peptides and suggests, along with the restricted salivary gland expression, that helodermin and exendin-4 coevolved to serve a separate specialized function. Probing of a variety of rat and human tissues on Northern blots, human and rat Southern blots, and genomic and cDNA libraries with either helodermin- or exendin-4-specific cDNAs failed to identify evidence for mammalian homologues. These data indicate that helodermin and exendin-4 are not the precursors to VIP and GLP-1 and that they belong to a separate peptide family encoded by separate genes. Furthermore, the existence of as yet undiscovered mammalian homologues to helodermin and exendin-4 seems unlikely. A large number of nonmammalian peptides that are bioactive in mammals, and thus are able to interact with mammalian receptors, have been discovered in species such as amphibians, reptiles, and insects. In particular, frog skin and reptile and insect venoms are rich sources of such bioactive peptides (2Bertaccini G. Pharmacol. Rev. 1976; 28: 127-177PubMed Google Scholar, 3Raufman J.-P. Reg.

Although mammalian homologues for some of these peptides have been demonstrated (6McDonald T.J. Jörnvall H. Nilsson G. Vagne M. Ghatei M. Bloom S.R. Mutt V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Reg. Pept. 1996; 61: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The difficult and often laborious process of isolating and sequencing the mammalian homologues in some instances has contributed to the delay in their discovery. Recent advances in molecular biological methods have provided sensitive and specific tools for speeding this discovery process and also have the potential to provide insight on genetic evolutionary relationships among these peptides that are present in different species (8Spindel E.R.

In 1982, it was observed that the crude venom of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) was a potent pancreatic secretagogue (12Raufman J.-P. Jensen R.T. Sutliff V.E. Pisano J.J. Gardner J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: G470-G474PubMed Google Scholar). Purification and sequencing of the active factors mediating this effect led to the discovery of the peptides helodermin and exendin-4 (13Hoshino M. Yanaihara C. Hong Y.-M. Kishida S. Katsumaru Y.

Helodermin, a peptide consisting of 35 amino acids, shares 53 and 42% homology with human pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide; VIP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; PHI, peptide histidine isoleucine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. 1The abbreviations used are: PACAP, pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide; VIP, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1; PHI, peptide histidine isoleucine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), respectively (Fig. 1). It was shown to have high affinity for the mammalian VIP2 receptor and equal potency and efficacy for stimulating cAMP production compared with mammalian VIP and PACAP (15Lutz E.M. Sheward W.J.

In some studies, even a helodermin-preferring receptor has been described (16Gourlet P. De Neef P. Woussen-Colle M.-C. Vandermeers A. Vandermeers-Piret M.-C. Robberecht P. Christophe J. Biochim.

Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies, using antibodies that did not cross-react with mammalian VIP or PACAP or other known members of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/VIP/PACAP peptide family suggested the existence of a mammalian homologue to helodermin distinct from VIP and PACAP (18Robberecht P.

It was shown to bind with high affinity to the mammalian GLP-1 receptor and to exhibit nearly equal potency and efficacy for stimulating cAMP production compared with mammalian GLP-1-(7–36) (22Fehmann H.C.

Based on these findings, there has been speculation that helodermin and exendin-4 are the evolutionary precursors to the known mammalian peptides PACAP or VIP and GLP-1, respectively, as well as speculation about the existence of as yet unknown mammalian homologues. Therefore, this study was designed to search for mammalian homologues to the reptilian peptides helodermin and exendin-4 and to examine the evolutionary relationship between helodermin and mammalian PACAP and VIP on the one hand and exendin-4 and mammalian GLP-1 on the other hand. The cloning of the helodermin and exendin-4 cDNAs revealed that the two reptilian peptides are, despite their differences in biological activity, evolutionarily closely related. They are, however, evolutionarily not related to mammalian PACAP/VIP or GLP-1, with which they share biological activities. Helodermin and exendin-4 seem to have a highly specialized function in the Gila monster as components of the venom because they do not seem to be expressed in tissues outside the salivary gland. Although we were able to identify Gila monster PACAP, VIP, and GLP-1, our extensive search for mammalian homologues to helodermin and exendin-4 was unsuccessful. A Gila monster (H. suspectum) was obtained from the Adobe Mountain Wildlife Center, Arizona Game and Fish Department (Phoenix, AZ). Denhardt's solution (100×) and sheared salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/ml) were from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). 1 m Tris (pH 7.4), 20× SSC (3.0m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), and SDS were purchased from Digene Diagnostics, Inc. (Beltsville, MD). Formamide, guanidine isothiocyanate, and formaldehyde solution were from Fluka Chemical Corp. (Ronkonkoma, NY). Guanidine Hydrochloride was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). All restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Total RNA was isolated from the salivary gland using the guanidine isothiocyanate/guanidine hydrochloride method (25Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using the Poly(A) PureTM mRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and reverse transcribed using the SuperscriptTMPreamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). A cDNA library was constructed using the Lambda ZAP II cloning vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 750 × 103 plaques were lifted onto duplicate nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized under low stringency conditions (10× Denhardt's solution, 2× SSC, and 200 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) at 37 °C with either helodermin or exendin-4 32P end-labeled degenerate oligonucleotide probes derived from their respective primary amino acid sequences. The probes were labeled to a specific activity of approximately 3 × 109 cpm/mg and added to the hybridization buffer to a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml. The sequence of the helodermin probe was GATGCIATITT(T/C)ACIGA (A/G)GA(A/G)TAC (I = inosine), corresponding to the amino acid sequence DAIFTEEY. The sequence of the exendin probe was AAICA(A/G)ATGGAIGA(A/G) GA(A/G)GCIGT, corresponding to the amino acid sequence KQMEEEAV. After hybridization, filters were washed twice under low stringency conditions for 15 min at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT (XAR2) film for 48 h at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. Positive clones were plaque purified and sequenced using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an automated 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Poly(A)+ RNA (0.05 μg/lane) isolated from the Gila monster salivary gland as described above was size fractionated through a 1.5% agarose denaturing formaldehyde gel and blotted overnight onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Following a 2-h prehybridization period at 50 °C, the membrane was hybridized (5× Denhardt's solution, 40% formamide, 4× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 20 mm Tris, and 100 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) to helodermin or exendin-4-specific cDNA probes for 14 h at 50 °C. The probes were generated by PCR using cDNA-specific primers. The helodermin probe was 265 bp long and corresponded to nucleotides 115–379 in Fig. 2. The exendin-4 probe was 263 bp long and corresponded to nucleotides 152–414 in Fig. 3. The probes were 32P random prime-labeled to a specific activity of approximately 3 × 109 cpm/mg and added to the hybridization solution to a concentration of 1 × 106 cpm/ml. After hybridization, the membranes were washed twice under high stringency conditions for 15 min with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. The blot was analyzed using a phosphorimager, the image analysis software MacBAS, and the Fujix Pictography 3000 digital image printer (Fuji Photo Film U. S. A., Inc., Elmsford NY). The size of the hybridizing transcripts were determined using Century RNA size markers from Ambion.Figure 3Exendin-4 cDNA and predicted amino acid sequence.

Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Total RNA from all other Gila monster tissues was prepared using the Total RNA isolation kit from Ambion. Poly(A)+ RNA from Gila monster salivary gland was purified as described above. RT-PCR was performed on 0.05 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from the salivary gland and 5 μg of total RNA from all other tissues using the SuperscriptTM Preamplification System (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification of the first strand cDNA (35 cycles; annealing temperature, 50 °C; extension temperature, 72 °C) was performed using the following helodermin or exendin-4 cDNA-specific primers: 5′-TTATCTTCTGAAGACTCAGAAAC-3′ (helodermin sense), 5′-TAATTGGAAACAAAGACATGT-3′ (helodermin antisense), 5′-CTGCAAGCTCAGAAAGCTTTGC-3′ (exendin-4 sense), and 5′-GCTCACTAATTGGAAACAAAGAC-3′ (exendin-4 antisense). The expected 265-bp helodermin and 263-bp exendin-4 PCR products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel. Total RNA from Gila monster brain, pancreas, and lung was isolated and reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA as described above for RT-PCR analysis. Partial cDNA sequences encoding the full or partial peptide sequence of Gila monster PACAP, peptide histidine isoleucine amide (PHI)/VIP, and glucagon/GLP-1 were cloned by PCR amplification of the first strand cDNA from brain, lung, and pancreas, respectively.

For PHI, PCR (35 cycles; annealing temperature, 50 °C) with the primers 5′-CGIAA(C/T)GCI(A/C)GXCA(C/T)GCIGA(C/T)GG-3′ (sense) (X = GATC) and 5′-TAGTT(A/G)TCIGT(A/G)AAXAGIGC(A/G)TC-3′ (antisense) amplified a 182-bp product encoding the 23 C-terminal amino acids of PHI, a 20-amino acid intervening peptide, and the first two N-terminal amino acids of VIP. The cDNA encoding the C-terminal amino acids of VIP was cloned using a 3′-RACE strategy. 5 μg of total RNA from Gila monster lung were reverse transcribed to first strand cDNA with the oligo(dT) 3′-RACE primer 5′-ACTCTAGAGTGTAGACATGCATCTCACTTTAGTAGAACTGG(T18)-3′, designed to contain the two separate primers 5′-ATCTCACTTTAGTAGAACTGG-3′ (RACE primer 1) and 5′-ACTCTAGAGTGTAGACATGC-3′ (RACE primer 2) for nested PCR. PCR (25 cycles; annealing temperature, 59 °C) with the sense primer 5′-GTGCTGGGCCAGTTATCAG-3′ derived from the Gila monster PHI sequence and the antisense RACE primer 1, followed by nested PCR (25 cycles; annealing temperature, 59 °C) with the nested sense primer 5′-TATCTGCATTCTCTGATGGC-3′ derived from the Gila monster PHI sequence and the antisense RACE primer 2 resulted in a candidate PCR product of approximately 430 bp. A second nested PCR (20 cycles; annealing temperature, 59 °C) using the sense primer 5′-TCGGAACCGCTCTCCAAAAGG-3′ derived from the sequence of the PHI/VIP-intervening peptide and the antisense RACE primer 2 resulted in a product of approximately 360 bp encoding the full Gila monster VIP sequence and approximately 280 bp of 3′ untranslated sequence. The sequence of the Gila monster VIP was confirmed using fewer PCR cycles by virtue of the nondegenerate sense primer from the PHI encoding cDNA sequence and the antisense primer from the 3′-untranslated region. All PCR products were subcloned into the pCR2.1 vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced with vector specific primers using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an automated 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). Gila monster genomic DNA was isolated from the liver using a genomic DNA purification Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). The DNA was digested with restriction enzymeBamHI, EcoRI, or HindIII, size fractionated on a 0.7% agarose gel (10 mg/lane), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was probed with32P random prime-labeled cDNA probes specific for the coding regions of helodermin (265 bp), exendin-4 (263 bp), Gila monster PACAP (122 bp), VIP (247 bp), and GLP-1 (255 bp). The hybridization conditions and buffer were the same as those described for Northern blot analysis. Following hybridization the membranes were washed twice for 15 min under high stringency conditions (0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C). The blots were analyzed using a phoshorimager, the image analysis software MacBAS, and the Fujix Pictography 3000 digital image printer (Fuji Photo Film U. S. A., Inc.). The size of the hybridizing DNA fragments was estimated using a 1-kb DNA ladder (Life Technologies, Inc.). Using the above-described 265-bp helodermin and 263-bp exendin-4-specific 32P random prime-labeled cDNA probes, cross-species Northern blots and mammalian libraries were screened for potential mammalian homologues to these peptides. Northern blot analysis was performed as described above, loading 2.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane for various rat tissues, including brain, pancreas, intestine, and lung. A human genomic library (Lambda FIX II vector, Stratagene) and a rat brain cDNA library (Lambda ZAP II vector, Stratagene) (approximately 750 × 103plaques/library) were screened according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nitrocellulose membranes were hybridized and washed for both Northern blots and libraries under low stringency conditions (hybridization for 14 h at 37 °C; 10× Denhardt's solution, 2× SSC, and 200 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA; and washing twice at room temperature for 15 min with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS). This study was undertaken to identify potential mammalian homologues for the reptilian peptides helodermin and exendin-4 suspected from previous immunohistochemical studies and biological actions of these peptides at the VIP/PACAP and GLP-1 receptors and to determine the evolutionary relationship between these reptilian peptides and the h"

The effects of FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) and the cyclophilins 18 and 23 on autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor prepared from plasma membranes of the human epidermoid cell line A431 have been investigated. Whereas FKBP12 inhibited EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity in a concentration-dependent manner, the cyclophilins did not affect autophos- phorylation. In contrast to the wild-type enzyme, several variants of FKBP12 with greatly reduced PPIase activity were unable to suppress EGF receptor tyrosine kinase significantly. Pervanadate an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, abolished the effect of FKBP12 on EGF receptor autophosphorylation.

Peptidylproline cis-trans-isomerases (PPIases 1The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidylproline cis-trans-isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CsA, cyclosporin A; Cyp, cyclophilin; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. ; EC number 5.2.1.8) are ubiquitous and abundant enzymes conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. They accelerate the slow cis/transisomerization of peptidylprolyl bonds in peptides and unfolded proteins (1Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 2Kay J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 3Galat A. Metcalfe S.M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 63: 67-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Until today three distinct PPIase families have been defined on the basis of primary structure differences: cyclophilins (Cyp), FK506-binding proteins (FKBP), and parvulins. The FKBP group may include the ribosomal trigger factors of bacteria as a subfamily that is not able to sequester the peptidomacrolide FK506 in the active site (4Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The occurrence of at least one member of PPIases in virtually all cell types or organisms along with pronounced amino acid sequence conservation suggests that these enzymes may play an important role in a range of biological processes. In human T cells the cytosolic proteins Cyp18 and FKBP12, which are the archetypal PPIases, were shown to represent the primary targets of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A (CsA), rapamycin, and FK506. These microbial products were identified as tightly binding inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of their respective family of PPIases (6Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar, 7Harding M.W. Galat A. Uehling D.E. Schreiber S.L.

However, it was demonstrated that inhibition of the catalyzed prolyl isomerization did not cause immunosuppression. According to the current knowledge, suppression of clonal expansion of T cells by FK506 or CsA is attributed to the inhibitory effect of the FK506·FKBP12 (or CsA·Cyp18) complex at the active site of the Ser/Thr phosphatase calcineurin (9Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3620) Google Scholar) leading to an increase in the phosphorylation state of the transcription factor NF-AT (10Mackay J.P. Shaw G.L.

In addition to its effect on T cell proliferation, FK506 modulates certain signaling events in other cellular systems. Thus different effects of the drug on intracellular protein phosphorylation have been observed (12Gschwendt M. Kittstein W. Marks F. Immunobiology. 1989; 179: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Richter A. Davies D.E. Alexander P. Biochem.

Obviously multiple effects of the immunosuppressive drugs on their respective PPIases, such as inhibition of PPIase activity and disruption of heteroligomeric PPIase complexes, make it difficult to achieve information about molecular details of FK506-dependent reactions. Correspondingly investigation of direct effects of FKBP12 or other PPIases allows to circumvent the complexity of reactions induced by FK506 or CsA. To a large extent PPIases have yet unknown physiological functions. There are just a few examples reported of how PPIases affect cellular events in the absence of the inhibitory drugs at the molecular level (19Folmer R.H.A. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N.H. Hallenga K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Rosenwirth B. Billich A. Datema R. Donatsch P. Hammerschmid F. Harrison R. Hiestand P. Jaksche H. Mayer P. Peichl P.

Nakayama T.A. Pak W.L. Travis G.H. Nature. 1996; 383: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Recent evidence points to an involvement of the parvulin-like nuclear PPIase Pin1 in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Thus it has been shown that PPIase inactive Pin1 variants, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, were unable to complement yeast mutants lacking the yeast Pin1 homologue ESS1/PTF1 (22Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Similarly the PPIase activity of Cyp18 was shown to be critical for the functional expression of homoligomeric neuronal nicotinic and type 3 serotonin receptors (23Helekar S.A. Patrick J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5432-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In complex biological model systems, such as liver regeneration (24Starzl T.E. Schreiber S.L. Albers M.W. Porter K.A. Foglieni C.S. Francavilla A. Transplantation. 1991; 52: 751-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or neutrophil chemotaxis (25Leiva M.C. Lyttle C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) it was shown that FKBP12 causes considerable influence on signaling proteins. Thus FKBP binds to and modulates the function of calcium release channels (26Marks A.R. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 631-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 27Cameron A.M. Steiner J.P.

Shah P.C. Rockwell S. Lechleider R.J. Martin J. Manganaro T. Donahoe P.K. Cell. 1996; 86: 435-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). These pieces of evidence point to a more widespread role of FKBPs in intracellular signal transduction. This study is aimed at investigating the effects of FKBP12 on epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor function in the human epidermoid cell line A431. In these cells, EGF receptor function has been studied in detail (29Boonstra J. Rijken P. Humbel B. Cremers F. Verkleij A. Van Bergen en Henegouwen P. Cell Biol. Int. 1995; 19: 413-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We show that FKBP12 inhibits EGF receptor autophosphorylationin vitro and present evidences for a similar effect in vivo. In contrast to wild-type FKBP12 several variants of the protein with largely reduced PPIase activity were unable to inhibit EGF receptor tyrosine kinase. Suppression of EGF receptor autophosphorylation by FKBP12 could be abolished by FK506 and pervanadate. The results suggest that inhibition of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase may involve a FKBP12 dependent activation of a phosphotyrosine phosphatase associated to the receptor and that PPIase activity is important for this function. Recombinant human FKBP12 was produced using the plasmid pQE60 (Qiagen) in Escherichia coli strain K12 M15/pREP4. FK506 was a gift from A. Lawen, CsA from Arzneimittelwerk Dresden GmbH, and rapamycin was a gift from Dr. H. Fliri. Human recombinant Cyp18 was from Boehringer Mannheim. Authentic mature mitochondrial Cyp23 from rat liver was a gift of M. Kramer (Halle). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig). Recombinant FKBP12 and variants of the protein have been produced as described recently (30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen). A431 cells (CRL 1555, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD)) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), streptomycin (100 IU/ml) and 7.5% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cellular DNA synthesis was measured by assaying [3H]thymidine incorporation as described (31Eriksson A. Siegbahn A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A431 cells were grown in 6-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum. The cells were deprived overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence or absence of 10 μm CsA or 10 μm FK506. The medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing leupeptin (1 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 mg/ml), orthovanadate (1 mm), and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), solubilized with Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) the blots were developed with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies (RC20-peroxidase conjugate, Affiniti, Nottingham) at 1:2,500 dilution. Bound peroxidase was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the ECL kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A431 cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer Tris-maleate 20 mm, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and once with buffer 20 mmPIPES, pH 7.2, and scraped. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 1200 rpm and 4 °C and homogenized by sonication in a Branson sonifier (1 min, level 3) at 4 °C in the same buffer containing leupeptin (1 mg/ml), pepstatin A (1 mg/ml), chymostatin (1 mg/ml), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm), and dithiothreitol (10 mm). The homogenate was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mmPIPES buffer, pH 7.2, and used as a membrane fraction. EGF receptor was prepared from these membranes by a procedure described by Akiyamaet al. (32Akiyama T. Kadoka T. Ogawara H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 131: 442-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, this protocol includes solubilization of the membranes with Triton X-100, affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin, and tyrosine-Sepharose chromatography. Assay of EGF receptor autophosphorylation was carried out in a final volume of 30 μl. EGF receptor preparation from A431 cells (15.5 μg of protein per assay) was incubated in the presence of 1.2 μg/ml EGF, 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), and 3 mm MnCl2 (final concentrations) for 30 min on ice. Immunophilins were added 30 min before treatment with the growth factor. In some experiments, sodium pervanadate, prepared as described by Pumiglia et al. (33Pumiglia K.M. Lau L.F. Huang C.K. Burroughs S. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), was added together with FKBP12. Phosphorylation was initiated by the admixture of [γ-32P]ATP (3–5 μCi, final concentration 2 μm) and terminated after 10 min by addition of 30 μl of 2-fold concentrated SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide gels and to autoradiographic analysis. Radioactivity incorporated into the EGF receptor band was quantified using a GS250 Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad). Determination of ATP concentration in the assay after phosphorylation was performed by evaluating the peak area of the isolated ATP peak at a migration time of 7.10 min at 200 nm in capillary electrophoresis (Applied Biosystems 270 A-HAT. 25 kV, 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.6). The effect of different PPIases on EGF receptor tyrosine kinase prepared from A431 cells has been investigated. Recombinant human FKBP12 or the cyclophilins 18 and 23 were mixed with the EGF receptor and autophosphorylation was assayed. As shown in Fig. 1 A FKBP12 significantly suppressed EGF receptor phosphorylation, whereas pig kidney cytosolic cyclophilin (Cyp18) or mature rat liver mitochondrial cyclophilin (Cyp23) were ineffective. No concomitant phosphorylation of the added FKBP12 was observed (results not shown). ATP depletion of the assay as a basis for the observed effect could be excluded as well. Changing the ATP concentration from 1 to 100 μm did not affect the ratio of the EGF receptor autophosphorylation in the absence of to that in the presence of 1.5 μm FKBP12. In an experiment using 2 μm ATP, no significant decrease in the peak area of the ATP peak (±5%) during phosphorylation reaction could be determined by capillary electrophoresis (data not shown). The effect of FKBP12 was found to be dose- and time-dependent, being most prominent at high protein concentrations and long incubation times (Fig. 1,B and C). After 10 min of incubation, half-maximal inhibition of autophosphorylation was achieved at about 1.2 μm FKBP12. Several approaches were utilized to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibitory effect on EGF receptor autophosphorylation. Using FKBP12 variants, we investigated the role of PPIase activity on the autophosphorylation of purified EGF receptor preparations. As shown in Fig. 2, FKBP12 variants bearing D37L or F99Y mutations expressed greatly reduced inhibitory effects. In comparison to wild-type FKBP, both protein variants are known to be unaffected in the secondary structure (30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). They both exhibit 3–6% residual activity of the wild-type enzyme when assayed with tetrapeptide standard substrates for PPIase activity but have an altered specificity for amino acid residues flanking proline in substrates (30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To further explore the specificity of the inhibitory effect of FKBP12, we tested the FKBP-like core of the trigger factor. The trigger factor is a fully active FKBP-like PPIase but structurally distinct from FKBP12 by active site construction (30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Compared with the nearly complete inhibitory effect induced by wild-type FKBP12, the trigger factor (TF) caused only about 30% reduction of autophosphorylation (Fig. 2). Thus, both PPIase activity and substrate specificity of FKBP12 seem to be essential for the suppression of EGF receptor autophosphorylation. We next elucidated the effect of the peptidomacrolide FK506 on the inhibition of autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor induced by FKBP12. FK506 is known to suppress PPIase activity of FKBP12. As shown in Fig. 3 A FK506 at a 1.5 molar ratio to FKBP12 completely reversed the inhibitory effect of the PPIase. Direct stimulation of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase by FK506 can be excluded because in the absence of FKBP12 the macrolide induced a weak inhibition of autophosphorylation (about 10% inhibition at 1.5 μm FK506). Rapamycin, which is another effective inhibitor of FKBP12 activity (34Siekierka J.J. Wiederrecht G. Greulich H. Boulton D. Hung S.H. Cryan J. Hodges P.J. Sigal N.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21011-21015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), likewise abolished the suppression of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation by the PPIase when applied stoichiometrically (data not shown). The autophosphorylated EGF receptor in A431 cell membranes is rapidly dephosphorylated by endogenous protein tyrosine phosphatase (35Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Recently association of SH2 domain-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 to the EGF receptor in A431 cells has been demonstrated (35Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). SHP1 acts as an opponent of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and catalyzes dephosphorylation of the receptor phosphotyrosine residues. To resolve a possible involvement of tyrosine phosphatase in the observed FKBP12 effects we studied the influence of pervanadate, which acts as a specific inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Fig. 3 B shows that treatment of A431 membranes with 100 μm pervanadate nearly abolishes the inhibitory effect of FKBP12 on EGF receptor autophosphorylation. The basal level of autophosphorylation, which is slightly decreased by FKBP12, has been proved to be insensitive toward pervanadate. To study the interaction of FKBP12 and EGF receptor in vivo, we investigated the effect of FK506 on the proliferation of A431 cells. It has been recently shown that EGF is able to inhibit the growth of this cell line but the mechanism of this effect is unknown (13Richter A. Davies D.E. Alexander P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One could expect that FK506, which abolished the inhibitory effect of FKBP12 on EGF receptor autophosphorylation, would produce an inhibition of A431 cell growth via an indirect stimulation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 4 A, a corresponding effect could indeed be detected. These data are similar to a recent observation by Richter et al. (13Richter A. Davies D.E. Alexander P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Finally we investigated the effects of FK506 and CsA on EGF receptor autophosphorylation in intact A431 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 B FK506 induced a significant increase of EGF receptor autophosphorylation in vivo, whereas CsA showed no gross effect in comparison to the control. Most probably the in vivo effect of FK506 should be due to a direct interaction of the macrolide with endogenous FKBP12. The expression of EGF receptor protein in the cells was unaltered excluding possible contribution of protein synthesis to the effect of FK506. Taken together the effects observed after treatment of A431 cells with FK506 are in agreement with the results on the inhibition of EGF receptor autophosphorylation induced by FKBP12 in vitro. The sequential signaling events induced by binding of EGF to the EGF receptor include receptor dimerization, stimulation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and finally autophosphorylation of defined tyrosine residues of the receptor protein. Negative regulation of the autophosphorylation is mediated by the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1, which has been shown to associate tightly with the phosphorylated EGF receptor (35Tomic S. Greiser U. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Imyanitov E. Ullrich A. Böhmer F.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21277-21284Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). According to this schema, the inhibitory effect of FKBP12 on EGF receptor autophosphorylation could be due to either suppression of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity or to a stimulation of associated protein tyrosine phosphatase. The partial elimination of the FKBP12 effect induced by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, pervanadate, points to the latter explanation. The role of FKBP12 in generating the inhibitory effect on EGF receptor autophosphorylation might be related to its enzymatic function as a PPIase. In line with this interpretation, two site-directed FKBP12 variants, D37L and F99Y, with reduced PPIase activity exhibited reduced ability to suppress EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that PPIase activity of FKBP12 could facilitate conformational changes during the proposed interaction of the protein tyrosine phosphatase with the phosphorylated EGF receptor thus accelerating dephosphorylation of this protein substrate. Alternatively or in addition to a PPIase effect, specific binding of FKBP12 to the EGF receptor or the associated phosphatase may be involved in the inhibitory effect on EGF receptor autophosphorylation. Thus the failure of the trigger factor to efficiently affect EGF receptor autophosphorylation demonstrates that PPIase catalysis does not suffice for the effect. The trigger factor domain is more active than FKBP12 toward most tetrapeptides used in the routine PPIase assay. However, distinct active sites were indicated by the lack of inhibition by FK506 on the trigger factor PPIase activity (4Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Nierhaus K.H. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.U. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4939-4948Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 30Tradler T. Stoller G. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In a similar manner the absence of inhibitory effects of Cyp18 and Cyp23 could be explained. In our experiments, retardation of EGF receptor autophosphorylation was abolished in response to the FKBP12 inhibitors FK506 and rapamycin. Since stoichiometric amounts of the inhibitors were found to be required for complete reversal of the FKBP12 effect, any function of the FKBP12·drug complexes reminiscent of inhibition of calcineurin could be ruled out. Indeed, the in vivo effects of FK506 on the autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor and the proliferation of A431 correspond to the results obtained in vitro. Assuming endogenous FKBP12 as the intracellular target for FK506, the increased autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor can be interpreted on the basis of an inhibition of the enzymatic activity of the PPIases by the peptidomacrolide. Suppression of PPIase activity could induce a stimulation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase via inhibition of an associated protein tyrosine phosphatase. The inhibitory effect of FK506 on the proliferation of A431 cells can be explained on the same basis. In contrast to the growth stimulation of epithelial cells, which is commonly observed after treatment with EGF, A431 cells are known to be inhibited by admixture of EGF and following activation of the EGF receptor (37Chen J.-K. Lin S.-S. Life Sci. 1993; 53: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, stimulation of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase by FK506 should induce growth inhibition of the cell line. Enhanced phosphorylation associated with FK506 treatment was already obtained for neuronal cell lines transfected with nitric oxide synthase (14Dawson T.M. Steiner J.P. Dawson V.L. Dinerman J.L. Uhl G.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Another link of PPIases to neuronal protein phosphorylation was established by the growth-associated protein 43, whose phosphorylation was found to be augmented by both FK506 and CsA (17Lyons W.E. Steiner J.P. Snyder S.H. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2985-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strong stimulation by FK506 of neurite outgrowth was thought to be associated with its effects on phosphorylation. Thus the intracellular protein phosphorylation machinery seems to represent an important target for immunophilins. Taken together we could demonstrate inhibition of EGF receptor autophosphorylation by FKBP12 in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that the inhibitory effect of FKBP12 is due to stimulation of a protein tyrosine phosphatase associated with the EGF receptor, and PPIase activity of FKBP12 could be involved in this effect. Considering the cellular concentration of FKBP12, which approaches 20 μm in Jurkat cells (38Siekierka J.J. Wiederrecht G. Cryan J. Hung S.H.Y. Comisky M. Sigal N.H. Transplant. Proc. 1991; 23: 2720-2721PubMed Google Scholar), its observed inhibitory function for EGF receptor autophosphorylation may be of biological relevance. After submission of this paper, an inhibition of the transphosphorylation of the transforming growth factor-β receptor subunits I and II by FKBP12 was demonstrated (39Chen Y.-G. Liu F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3866-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, which blocks binding of FKBP12 to the transforming growth factor-β receptor has been shown to reverse the inhibitory effect of FKBP12 on the receptor phosphorylation. Together with our data these findings point to a more general role of FKBP12 in the regulation of receptor-induced phosphorylation events."

Corneal KS is N-linked to Asn of an NX(S/T) site through a complex oligosaccharide linkage region. Only some sites receive KS, whereas others remain in a high mannose form. To determine whether the attachment of KS was biased toward specific sites, we isolated trypsin-digested KS-containing fragments of chick corneal proteoglycans and sequenced the peptides. Results showed that all of the peptides sequenced aligned to the deduced amino acid sequence of either chick lumican or chick keratocan at the first, third, and fourth potential N-linked sites. Sites 1 and 4 in lumican and keratocan are in a homologous location. By analogy with the structure of ribonuclease inhibitor (a Leu-rich repeat containing protein), the KS chains would extend outward on the outer face of a horseshoe-like structure. The amino acid sequences surrounding the potential N-linked sites were also compared. Sites receiving KS tend to have a higher occurrence of aromatic residues, in particular Phe, located within 3 amino acids of NX(S/T). These conserved Phe residues may have a role in the conversion of high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides to polylactosamine and/or keratan sulfate.

The corneal stroma contains an extensive matrix consisting of collagen and proteoglycans that interact with each other to produce a transparent structure.

In adult chicken corneas, a portion of the population of decorin also receive KS to make a decorin isoform containing both chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and KS (8Blochberger T.C. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KS is a repeating disaccharide of glucosamine and galactose that bears sulfate esters. In cornea, KS is N-linked to an Asn residue of an NX(S/T) site through a linkage region that is a complex-type oligosaccharide (9Nilsson B. Nakazawa K. Hassell J.R. Newsome D.A. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6056-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on corneal KSPGs showed N-linked sites were substituted with either a high mannose form or processed to a keratan sulfate containing complex form (9Nilsson B. Nakazawa K.

Chem. 1983; 258: 6051-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since complex type oligosaccharides as such were not found, it was proposed that all N-linked sites processed to a complex type were also further processed to receive keratan sulfate. Biochemical analysis indicated that the N-linked sites in the corneal KSPGs are substituted with either high mannose oligosaccharides or KS chains (i.e. no sites are left unsubstituted) (9Nilsson B.

Analysis of core protein sequence deduced from cDNA clones for lumican and keratocan indicates there are four to five potentialN-linked oligosaccharide sites, depending upon the species (2Blochberger T.C.

Characterization of KS containing proteoglycans purified from embryonic chick corneas reveals that, on the average, not all the N-linked sites are processed to contain KS and that only half of the total sites that are substituted remain asN-linked oligosaccharides (11Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1423-1430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of KS proteoglycans from bovine corneas indicates that three of five N-linked sites on keratocan and one of the four sites on lumican and osteoinductive factor have KS (12Funderburgh J.L.

It is not known, however, whichN-linked sites in any of the corneal proteoglycans receive KS. The deduced amino acid sequences from cDNA clones to corneal proteoglycans reveal that they are homologous in structure and that they belong to the Leu-rich proteoglycan (LRP) gene family (1Li W.

We have previously developed methods to purify chick KSPG and have isolated cDNA clones to chick lumican (2Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.P. Hemper J. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 347-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Blochberger T.C. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we cloned chick keratocan and then isolated and sequenced the KS peptides from chick corneal proteoglycans to determine which N-linked oligosaccharides on chick lumican and keratocan receive KS. A previously prepared chick corneal cDNA library (2Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.P. Hemper J. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 347-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was screened using a32P-radiolabeled cDNA clone to bovine keratocan (5Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.S. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9759-9763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) obtained by PCR. Briefly, the bovine keratocan clone was generated by reverse transcription-PCR using DNase-treated RNA isolated from cultured bovine corneal fibroblasts and the following primers: reverse transcription primer 5′-GACTTTAACTGCAAGAGTACGC-3′; forward primer 5′-TGGAGAACCTGACCCTTCTTGAC-3′; reverse primer 5′-ATCCAGACGGAGGTAGCGAAGATG-3′. The resulting 491-bp product was subcloned into the GenHunter vector (GenHunter Corp.) and sequenced to confirm its identity as bovine keratocan. The high specific activity PCR probe was generated in a standard 20-cycle PCR reaction containing 0.1 ng/μl plasmid DNA, forward and reverse keratocan primers, 20 μm dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 0.6 μm[α-32P]dCTP, 3000 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products). Screening 140,000 plaque-forming units of the library under low stringency conditions yielded 250 positive clones; 74 phage plugs were extracted followed by PCR to determine which clones were full-length. Briefly, 5 μl of extracted phage was lysed in 35 μl of TE, 0.1% Tween 20 (GenHunter Corp.), boiled 5 min, and centrifuged 2 min; the supernatant was collected, and 2.0 μl was used in a 20-μl, 30–40-cycle, PCR reaction with the T3 primer (Stratagene) and keratocan reverse primer. The five largest clones, determined by PCR, were used for the second library screen; positive clones were selected, and the pBluescript plasmid was rescued from the Uni-Zap XR vector as described previously (1Li W. Vergnes J.P. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Restriction mapping of these five clones along with PCR reactions using the T3 primer and keratocan backward primer confirmed which clones contained the largest keratocan cDNA inserts. Two clones of similar size were sequenced (Seqwright), and both were confirmed to be keratocan by homology with bovine keratocan. One of the clones was full-length, and the other contained a longer alternative 3′ end but was lacking 496 bp from the 5′ end. The sequence reported in this publication is from the first, full-length clone. Corneas were removed from adult chicken eyes obtained from a local source and stored at −80 °C. The proteoglycans were extracted from the corneas, and the keratan sulfate containing proteoglycans were isolated and purified from the extract using previous procedures (8Blochberger T.C.

The extract was dialyzed against 6 m urea containing 0.05m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Chaps (Tris-buffered urea) and applied to a column (2.5 × 5.0 cm) of DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same solvent. The proteoglycans were eluted with a linear gradient (0.15–1.15 m) of NaCl, and their elution position was determined with dimethymethylene blue (DMB) (14Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The tubes containing proteoglycans were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized to dryness. The proteoglycans were dissolved in 3 ml of 4m guanidine HCl containing 0.02 m Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% Chaps and applied to a column (1.5 × 100 cm) of Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with the same solvent. The elution position of the proteoglycans determined as above and those tubes containing proteoglycans were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized to dryness. The proteoglycans (42 mg) isolated from CL-4B were reconstituted in 5.0 ml of chondroitinase ABC buffer containing proteolytic inhibitors and digested with 5 units of chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Inc.) at 37 °C for 3 h. The digest was dialyzed against Tris-buffered urea overnight, applied to a column (1.0 × 8.0 cm) of Source 15Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Tris-buffered urea, and eluted with a NaCl gradient by FPLC. The elution position of the proteoglycan fractions (now only those containing keratan sulfate), determined as above, were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized to dryness. The keratan sulfate containing proteoglycans were dissolved in 2.0 ml of 4 m guanidine containing 0.02m Tris, pH 6.0, 0.1% Chaps and applied to a column (1.6 × 50 cm) of Superose 6 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with the same solvent. The tubes containing the keratan sulfate proteoglycans were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized to yield 18 mg. The keratan sulfate proteoglycans were dissolved at 10 mg/ml 4 m guanidine dialyzed against deionized water and stored at −20 °C as the KSPG stock. Digestion of 5 μl of the KSPG stock with keratanase (Seikagaku American, Inc.) was performed as described previously (15Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Coomassie Blue staining resulted in a broad band at ∼ Mr = 52,000 (not shown); the core glycoprotein size previously shown (13Nakazawa K.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13751-13757Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans treated with keratanase. 6 mg (600 μl) of the KSPG stock was dialyzed against 0.1 mTris, pH 8.0, and then digested with 60 μg ofl-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. The sample was applied to a column (0.5 × 4 cm) of Source 15Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.02 m Tris, pH 8.0, and eluted with a gradient (0.0–1.0m) of NaCl on FPLC. The tubes containing the KS peptides were identified by the DMB assay, and the amount was calculated using KS (Seikagaku America) as a standard. The KS containing fractions were pooled, dialyzed against deionized water, and lyophilized to dryness. The KS peptides were reconstituted in 400 μl of 4 mguanidine HCl containing 0.02 m Tris, pH 6.8, Chaps 0.1% and then applied to a column (1.0 × 30 cm) of Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted in the same solvent. The tubes containing the KS peptides, determined as above, were pooled and dialyzed against deionized water. A portion of the KS peptides were further digested with keratanase, as above, followed by reversed phase chromatography. KS containing peptides were purified by application to a Vydac C-18 reversed phase column (30 × 2.1 mm) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0–70% over 45 min) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min, and the eluate was monitored at 220 nm. Glycopeptide containing samples were compared with a buffer, and enzyme containing blank and peaks unique to the peptide containing sample were analyzed by Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer 477A sequencer with on-line detection of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. Samples exhibited a prominent peak of Chaps which eluted later than the peptides. As is typical for glycopeptides, peaks were often rather broad and heterogeneous. 140,000 recombinants of a Uni-Zap XR cDNA chick corneal fibroblast library were screened using a high specific activity32P-bovine keratocan probe generated by PCR. Full-length clones were determined using phage lysis and PCR with the T3 primer which anneals to the vector and the bovine keratocan reverse primer. PCR-selected phage clones were purified and rescued in the pBluescript plasmid from the Uni-Zap vector. Two putative clones, which were similar in insert size, were sequenced. The first clone consisted of a 2455-bp cDNA sequence containing a 138-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 353 amino acid open reading frame, and a 1257-bp 3′-untranslated region including the polyadenylated tail (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of the full-length clone contains a signal peptide, underlined, estimated by the “-3, -1” rule (16von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), of 21 residues in length with a cleavage site between the Thr and Arg residues (Fig. 1). The sequence contains 7 Cys residues, one in the signal peptide, four near the N terminus and two near the C terminus. In addition, there are five potentialN-linked oligosaccharide attachment sites, determined by the Asn-Xaa-(Ser/Thr) consensus sequence, located between the N- and C-terminal Cys residues. Although the polyadenylated tail was sequenced (A32), the highly conserved AATAAA signal was not present 11–30 nucleotides upstream from the site of poly(A) addition. However, a similar sequence, AAATAA, was found located within this region. The second cDNA clone contained a 2456-nucleotide cDNA sequence that was identical to the sequence of the first clone except it contained additional 3′-untranslated sequence (not shown) and lacked the 5′ 496 nucleotides which encoded for the N-terminal 119 amino acids. Interestingly, PRELP, another member of the Leu-rich proteoglycan (LRP) family, has been shown to have several different 3′-untranslated regions which accounts for the mRNA sizes of 1.7, 4.6, and 6.7 kilobase pairs (17Grover J. Chen X.-N. Korenberg J.R. Recklies A.D. Roughly P.J. Genomics. 1996; 38: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the first cDNA clone to sequences in GenBankTM revealed the highest homology to bovine keratocan, accession number U48360 (Fig. 2). There are only two regions where major variations exist, in the signal peptide and in the C-terminal domain at amino acids 306–320. The remainder of the protein is highly conserved with a 72.3% amino acid identity between chick and bovine keratocan. In comparison between chick and bovine species, keratocan was more conserved than lumican but not as conserved as decorin. Alignment of keratocan with other members of the LRP family revealed that both chick and bovine keratocan have the highest homology with human PRELP (18Bengtsson E. Neame P.J. HeinegŚrd D. Sommarin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25639-25644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a 53.3 and 54.5% amino acid identity, respectively. Chick keratocan had a slightly higher amino acid identity with bovine fibromodulin (19Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. HeinegŚrd D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2601-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) than with chick lumican (2Blochberger T.C. Vergnes J.P. Hemper J. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 347-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and had a much lower homology with chick decorin (1Li W. Vergnes J.P. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), 39.8, 37.7, and 26.8%, respectively. It appears that keratocan, PRELP, fibromodulin, and lumican are all within the same gene family. This family can be divided further into two subgroups where keratocan and PRELP share >53% homology and lumican and fibromodulin share >45% homology between them, respectively. Chick keratocan contains 11 Leu-rich repeats, all of which are of the B-type (20Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), which is defined by a highly conserved Asn residue in the 10th position of the repeat. The Leu-rich repeat as well as the surrounding amino acids follow a pattern in which certain residues within each repeat are conserved at the same position. Therefore, the first 9 Leu-rich repeats of chick keratocan can be organized into equally spaced motifs and units as shown in Fig. 3. The motifs 1, 2, and 3 are joined tandemly to form a unit. Each of the motifs has unique spacing and a unique Leu-rich repeat consensus sequence as follows: motif 1 has a spacing of 24 amino acid residues, motif 2 is the longest at 25–26 residues, and motif 3 is the shortest with 20–21 amino acids. This arrangement produces a triplet where the three motifs are aligned tandemly, and this arrangement is repeated three times. In addition to each motif having a unique consensus sequence within the Leu-rich repeat, there are also sequence identities that surround these repeats. For instance, Pro residues in position 16 of motif 1 and in positions 16 and 20 of motif 3 may give the motif a specific secondary structure. There are also five Phe residues, in motif 1 at position 20 and in motif 2 at position 22, that are not only highly conserved (see Fig. 2) but are located 5–6 amino acids N-terminal of a Leu-rich repeat. In addition to the 9 Leu-rich repeats shown in Fig. 3, there are two additional repeats that are present in chick keratocan. They are excluded from the units because their spacing is altered, and Leu-repeat 11 is located between the two C-terminal Cys residues making it structurally unique. The Asn residues in chick corneal proteoglycans that receive KS were also determined. Adult chicken corneas were extracted with 4m guanidine in the presence of protease inhibitors, and the corneal KSPG proteoglycans were purified using both molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography as well as digestion with chondroitinase ABC according to previous studies (8Blochberger T.C. Cornuet P.K. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20613-20619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This KSPG stock was then used to determine the KS attachment sites. The KSPGs were digested with trypsin, fractionated over a Source 15Q FPLC column, and eluted with NaCl, and the elution position of KS was determined using the DMB assay (Fig. 4). The DMB-positive fractions 15–30 were pooled and further purified on a Superose 12 FPLC column (Fig. 5). There were three KS containing peaks after Superose 12. The peak at fraction 10 had a very low DMB reactivity and may contain partially digested core protein due to its larger size. The peak in tubes 21/22 contained a high concentration of contaminating peptides and very small sized DMB-positive material; therefore, only the fractions in the largest main peak, fractions 12–17, were pooled and used for further analysis including amino acid sequencing.Figure 5KS containing fractions after Source 15Q FPLC were pooled and further purified on a Superose 12 FPLC column. The protein content for each tube is indicated by the O.D. at 280 nm on the left-handed y axis. A DMB assay was used to determine which fractions contained KS as indicated on the right-handed yaxis. The bar on the top of the graph shows which tubes were pooled and used for amino acid sequencing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The experimentally determined sequences from the KS peptides were then aligned with the deduced sequence from the cDNA clones (Fig. 6). The sequences containing potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, starting at the estimated trypsin digestion site are marked with arrows, and any amino acid sequence, obtained by Edman degradation, of the KS containing peptides is listed below. There were a total of 11 peptide fragments that were sequenced, six of which aligned to chick lumican at three different N-linked glycosylation sites as follows: site 1, amino acids 77–93 with KS attachment on Asn-91; site 3, residues 154–167 with Asn-165 receiving KS chains; site 4, amino acids 245–259 with KS attachment on Asn-257. Similarly, five peptides that were sequenced aligned with the deduced amino acid sequence of chick keratocan at three different N-linked glycosylation sites as follows: site 1, amino acids 73–96 with KS attachment on Asn-94; site 3, residues 207–225 with Asn-223 receiving KS attachment; site 4, amino acids 249–267 with Asn-261 receiving KS. Although the peptide fragments sequenced matched to sites 1, 3, and 4 in lumican and keratocan, it is still possible that sites 2 and 5 receive KS and that we did not sequence these fragments due to either low abundance (KS attachment at these sites is a rare event) or that the regions surrounding these sites were trypsin-resistant (in which the site would be contained in a large fragment such as the peak in fraction 10 after Superose 12 (Fig. 5)). Although both proteoglycans receive KS attachment on sites 1, 3, and 4, only sites 1 and 4 are located in a homologous region of the core protein (see Fig. 8). Several peptides contained one or two residues that were undetermined, indicated by the X, during cycle sequencing which may be due to carbohydrate linked to the core protein at that site. In addition, there was one discrepancy between the deduced amino acid sequence and the peptide sequencing. The two peptides sequenced which aligned to lumican, residues 245–259, contain a Ser at position 247, whereas the cDNA deduced amino acid sequence indicates that this position should contain a Thr residue. The data on the amino acid sequencing were clear, and it is possible that there was a single nucleotide change during library construction or that this difference is due to a polymorphism. All other peptide fragments matched lumican and keratocan exactly. None of the peptides aligned to other published sequences, and no peptide sequence was obtained that did not match either lumican or keratocan. The sequence flanking the NX(S/T) sites containing KS in lumican and keratocan were compared with sequence flanking the NX(S/T) sites that did not contain detectable KS (Fig. 7 A). One striking difference in the sequences was the presence of aromatic residues surrounding most of the NX(S/T) sites that contain KS. The sequences surrounding the KS attachment sites contained 7 aromatic residues compared with only 2 aromatic residues surrounding the sites that were not found to contain KS. In particular, most of the sites that contain KS have a Phe residue present at a position within 3 amino acids N-terminal to the Asn residue. The only exception was site 3 in lumican which did not contain any aromatic residues in this region. The results of this study show that chick keratocan has a message size of 2.45 kilobase pairs that encodes for a 353-amino acid protein which has high homology with bovine keratocan (72.3%). As is typical of proteins in the LRP family, chick keratocan contains 11 Leu-rich repeats that can be arranged into three units comprised of three motifs. This arrangement reveals the unique consensus sequence for each units' Leu-rich repeat and the amino acids surrounding it in the motif. This study also shows that both chick lumican and chick keratocan have three out of five potential N-linked oligosaccharide sites substituted with KS chains. N-Linked oligosaccharides at sites 1, 3, and 4 in both chick lumican and keratocan are modified to KS. There were, however, some KS containing peptides that were exceptionally large (Fig. 5) that we did not attempt to characterize, and they may contain additional sequences. Previous studies on KSPGs from bovine cornea indicate that keratocan has three KS chains, whereas lumican and osteoglycin contained only one KS chain (12Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, all the sequences we detected aligned with either lumican or keratocan. It may be that chick corneal osteoglycin is present in too low abundance to be detected in the material that was characterized. In support of this, bovine KS core proteins were found to be present at a 3:6:2 ratio, for keratocan, lumican, and osteoglycin, respectively (4Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P. Hassell J.R. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11874-11880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of N-linked sites that have KS chains to sites that were not found in the KS-containing peptide fractions show that KS-containing sites tend to have a nearby aromatic residue, usually a Phe. More specifically, sites 1, 3, and 4 of keratocan and sites 1 and 4 of lumican all have Phe located within 3 residues N-terminal to the Asn. Conversely, all of the sites that were not found to contain KS chains lack Phe in this region. In support of the possible role of aromatic residues potentially enhancing KS attachment, fibromodulin, which can have KS chains on the first 4 out of 5 N-linked oligosaccharide sites (21Plaas A.H.K. Neame P.J. Nivens C.M. Reiss L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20634-20640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has at least one aromatic residue located near (within 5 amino acids) the Asn in the NX(S/T) consensus site (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, sites 1 and 4 in fibromodulin contain Phe within 3 amino acids of the Asn with KS attached. There are exceptions to this trend, such as site 3 in chick lumican lacks an aromatic residue near the Asn, yet supports KS attachment, whereas chick lumican site 2 contains a Tyr residue two amino acids N-terminal to the Asn but was not found in the GAG attachment fractions. Thus, the presence and proximity of aromatic residues, in particular Phe, near the Asn may enhance or facilitate KS attachment but is not required or necessary for this processing to occur. Most of the Phe residues in close proximity to KS-substituted sites are also located 5–6 amino acids N-terminal to a Leu-rich repeat (see Fig. 3). This occurs with sites 1 and 4 in lumican, keratocan, and fibromodulin and may indicate that the potential role of these Phe residues is to support the secondary structure necessary for the β-sheet (i.e. at the top of the coil, see Fig. 8) as well as KS attachment. Regardless of the signals present in the core protein which may enhance or signal KS attachment, the developmental or tissue-specific expression of the transferases and sulfotransferases required for KS synthesis will regulate whether the core protein can be processed to the proteoglycan form. The location of the KS attachment sites in lumican and keratocan were compared in a model based on the x-ray crystallography structure of porcine ribonuclease inhibitor, a protein comprised entirely of Leu-rich repeats (20Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1993; 366: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 22Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1995; 374: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). A major feature of this model is that the Leu-rich repeats are coiled in a spiral with the Leu-rich regions stacked in a parallel β-sheet array. Fig. 8 shows all the potentialN-linked sites and those substituted with KS in a two-dimensional model for lumican and keratocan. The first 10 Leu-rich repeats are contained in the central coiled domain between the N- and C-terminal globular domains. The 11th Leu-rich repeat for both lumican and keratocan is located between the two Cys within the C-terminal globular domain. The putative β-sheet, comprised of residues LXXLXLXXN within the Leu-rich repeat, is shown as the top third of the coil in which XLX (i.e. amino acids YLY in repeat 1) are located at the top, exposed surface of the spiraled coil. Based on the structure of ribonuclease inhibitor, these coils would bend into a horseshoe-like structure (as implied in Fig. 8) with the Leu-rich repeats in closer proximity to each other thereby forming the inner, concave surface of the horseshoe. This hypothetical configuration also allows all three of the KS attachment sites in lumican and keratocan to extend outward on the outer, convex surface of the horseshoe structure. It is possible that the inner, Leu-rich, surface of the horseshoe-like structure is involved in protein-protein interaction, possibly collagen binding, whereas the outer surface, with the protruding GAG side chains, is involved in “space filling” between the collagen molecules. Comparison of the GAG attachment sites within keratocan, lumican, and fibromodulin indicate that sites 1 and 4 in each of these proteoglycans are located in the same homologous region of the core protein, and all of these proteoglycans support KS attachment at these sites. These two sites are located three residues N-terminal to a Leu-rich repeat which, according to our structural model shown in Fig. 8, allows the GAG chain to protrude outwards from the core protein. Site 3 which also receives KS chains is located in a different position to the Leu-rich repeat than sites 1 and 4. Lumican and fibromodulin have a homologous site 3 which is located at position 1 of a Leu-rich repeat. Keratocan has a unique site 3 which is located at position 9 within the Leu-rich repeat. Interestingly, this repeat is “unconventional” due to a Thr residue being present at the first position of the consensus LXXLXLXXNXL repeat instead of a Leu or Ile residue. This may represent a structure unique to keratocan. Despite these differences with site 3 between lumican and keratocan, our model in Fig. 8 indicates that the predicted three-dimensional structure would place site 3 in a similar location, and the GAG chains may also extend in the same direction so that lumican and keratocan may have a very similar three-dimensional appearance.

Present investigations were undertaken to understand its mechanism of chaperoning. For this functional in vitro analysis of α-crystallin we used xylose reductase (XR) from Neurospora crassa as the model system. Denaturation studies using the structure-perturbing agent guanidinium chloride indicated that XR folds through a partially folded state that resembles the molten globule. Fluorescence and delay experiments revealed that α-crystallin interacts with the molten globule state of XR (XR-m) and prevents its aggregation. Cold lability of α-crystallin·XR-m interaction was revealed by temperature shift experiments implicating the involvement of hydrophobic interactions in the formation of the complex. Reconstitution of active XR was observed on cooling the α-crystallin·XR-m complex to 4 °C or on addition of ATP at 37 °C. ATP hydrolysis is not a prerequisite for XR release since the nonhydrolyzable analogue 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) was capable of reconstitution of active XR. Experimental evidence has been provided for temperature- and ATP-mediated structural changes in the α-crystallin·XR-m complex that shed some light on the mechanism of reconstitution of active XR by this chaperone.

The relevance of our finding to the role of α-crystallin in vivo is discussed. The folding and assembly of a protein into its biologically active conformation is a complex succession of reactions involving the formation of secondary and tertiary structures and domains, the pairing of domains, and the oligomerization of folded monomers (1Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 2Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the various processes that govern protein folding has been the focus of intense research for the past decades. Numerousin vitro protein folding experiments have demonstrated that many proteins successfully achieve their correct native structures in the complete absence of other cellular factors and without input of energy. This led to the expectation that protein folding is determined by the information encoded by the amino acid sequence and proceedsin vivo by the same spontaneous mechanism (1Kim P.S. Baldwin R.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 459-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 2Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1987; 49: 117-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). However,in vivo folding and assembly of proteins occur in a highly complex heterogeneous environment, in which high concentrations of proteins in various stages of folding and with potentially interactive surfaces coexist that may change the folding potentials inherent in the sequence. Recently, a number of accessory proteins have been identified that affect the folding and subsequent assembly of proteins. These include the protein isomerases catalyzingcis-trans-isomerization of peptide bonds or disulfide exchange (3Freedman R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and the polypeptide binding proteins termed as “molecular chaperones” (5Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which the protein isomerases accelerate the rate-determining step in the folding of proteins are understood but perhaps not in detail (3Freedman R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1984; 9: 438-441Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 4Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Elucidating the mechanistic details underlying the efficient refolding of proteins by chaperones now appears to be an important consideration for defining how proteins fold in vivo. The GroEL and GroES proteins from Escherichia coli are among the most detailed characterized chaperones (5Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). Horwitz (6Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Until recently, α-crystallin was believed to be a lens-specific protein; however, now it has been reported to be present in many non-lenticular tissues (10Iwaki T. KumeIwaki A. Liem R. Goldman J.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 71-78Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 11Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) or hypertonic stress (12Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Numerous studies provide evidence that the ability of α-crystallin to suppress aggregation of damaged proteins plays a crucial role in maintaining the transparency of the ocular lens, and the failure of this function could contribute to the development of cataracts (13Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Kelley M.J. David L. Iwasaki N. Wright J. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18844-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important recent development is the finding that α-crystallin shows extensive structural similarity with small heat shock proteins that are known to act in vitro as molecular chaperones (15Merck K.B. Groenen P.J. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K.

Despite the growing interest in the chaperone action of α-crystallin, little is known about its mechanism of chaperoning. For this functional in vitro analysis of α-crystallin we used xylose reductase (XR), from Neurospora crassa as the model system. This oxidoreductase plays a crucial role in the fermentation of xylose to ethanol (20Rawat U.B. Bodhe A. Deshpande V. Rao M. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and has recently gained more importance due to its application in the synthesis of xylitol, an acariogenic non-caloric sweetener used in food products (21Bernd N. Wilfried N. Kulbe K.D. Klaus D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 52: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier we have undertaken structure-function studies to understand the contribution of essential amino acids in the catalytic mechanism of XR, an enzyme that belongs to the important class of oxidoreductases; the conformation and microenvironment of the active site has also been assessed using fluorescent chemoaffinity labeling (22Rawat U.B. Rao M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1293: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Rawat U.B. Rao M. Eur. J.

Various studies on XR will assist in its biotechnological exploitation. Experimental evidence presented in this paper serves to implicate that the chaperone α-crystallin stabilizes the molten globule state of XR and thus restrains the non-native conformer from exploring unproductive pathways. Lowering the temperature to 4 °C or presence of ATP at 37 °C induces a conformational change in α-crystallin·XR-m complex that is accompanied by a concomitant internalization of hydrophobic surfaces previously exposed. This acts to reduce the hydrophobic interactions that facilitates the dissociation of the complex further allowing reconstitution of the active XR. This paper reports for the first time the mechanism of α-crystallin-mediated reconstitution of an active enzyme and the role of ATP in the function of α-crystallin as a molecular chaperone. The folding and assembly of a protein into its biologically active conformation is a complex succession of reactions involving the formation of secondary and tertiary structures and domains, the pairing of domains, and the oligomerization of folded monomers (1Kim P.S.

The molecular mechanisms by which the protein isomerases accelerate the rate-determining step in the folding of proteins are understood but perhaps not in detail (3Freedman R.B. Trends Biochem.

Elucidating the mechanistic details underlying the efficient refolding of proteins by chaperones now appears to be an important consideration for defining how proteins fold in vivo. The GroEL and GroES proteins from Escherichia coli are among the most detailed characterized chaperones (5Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev.

Until recently, α-crystallin was believed to be a lens-specific protein; however, now it has been reported to be present in many non-lenticular tissues (10Iwaki T. KumeIwaki A. Liem R. Goldman J.E.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) or hypertonic stress (12Dasgupta S. Hohman T.C. Carper D. Exp. Eye Res. 1992; 54: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Numerous studies provide evidence that the ability of α-crystallin to suppress aggregation of damaged proteins plays a crucial role in maintaining the transparency of the ocular lens, and the failure of this function could contribute to the development of cataracts (13Groenen P.J. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 14Kelley M.J. David L. Iwasaki N. Wright J. Shearer T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18844-18849Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important recent development is the finding that α-crystallin shows extensive structural similarity with small heat shock proteins that are known to act in vitro as molecular chaperones (15Merck K.B. Groenen P.J. Voorter C.E.M. de Haard-Hoekman W.A. Horwitz J. Bloemendal H. de Jong W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1046-1052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Jakob U. Gaestel M. Engel K.

It was, however, unable to refold rhodanase denatured in 6 mGdmCl 1The abbreviations used are: GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; XR, xylose reductase; XR-u, unfolded state of XR; XR-m, molten globule state of XR; ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: GdmCl, guanidinium chloride; XR, xylose reductase; XR-u, unfolded state of XR; XR-m, molten globule state of XR; ANS, 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl imidodiphosphate.

Recently α-crystallin has been reported to bind the temperature-induced molten globule state of proteins (18Rajaraman K. Raman B. Rao Ch. M. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the growing interest in the chaperone action of α-crystallin, little is known about its mechanism of chaperoning. For this functional in vitro analysis of α-crystallin we used xylose reductase (XR), from Neurospora crassa as the model system. This oxidoreductase plays a crucial role in the fermentation of xylose to ethanol (20Rawat U.B. Bodhe A. Deshpande V. Rao M. Biotechnol. Lett. 1993; 15: 1173-1178Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and has recently gained more importance due to its application in the synthesis of xylitol, an acariogenic non-caloric sweetener used in food products (21Bernd N. Wilfried N. Kulbe K.D. Klaus D. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 52: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier we have undertaken structure-function studies to understand the contribution of essential amino acids in the catalytic mechanism of XR, an enzyme that belongs to the important class of oxidoreductases; the conformation and microenvironment of the active site has also been assessed using fluorescent chemoaffinity labeling (22Rawat U.B. Rao M.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1293: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 23Rawat U.B. Rao M. Eur. J.

Various studies on XR will assist in its biotechnological exploitation. Experimental evidence presented in this paper serves to implicate that the chaperone α-crystallin stabilizes the molten globule state of XR and thus restrains the non-native conformer from exploring unproductive pathways. Lowering the temperature to 4 °C or presence of ATP at 37 °C induces a conformational change in α-crystallin·XR-m complex that is accompanied by a concomitant internalization of hydrophobic surfaces previously exposed. This acts to reduce the hydrophobic interactions that facilitates the dissociation of the complex further allowing reconstitution of the active XR. This paper reports for the first time the mechanism of α-crystallin-mediated reconstitution of an active enzyme and the role of ATP in the function of α-crystallin as a molecular chaperone.

Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry indicated that this rat GST subunit (designated rGSTM5 in this report) has a significantly greater molecular mass (26,541 Da) than the other rat GST subunits. The mouse homologue (mGSTM5 subunit) was also identified and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Sequence analysis of rGSTM5 peptide fragments and the sequence deduced from a cDNA clone showed that the protein is highly homologous to the hGSTM3 and murine mGSTM5 subunits. All three GSTs of this subclass have N- and C-terminal extensions with C-terminal cysteine residues, but the two penultimate amino acids near the C terminus are divergent in the three species. The proteins of this class Mu subfamily have similar catalytic specificities and mechanisms, are all cysteine rich, are found mainly in testis, and share characteristics that distinguish them from other GSTs. Moreover, the rGSTM5 subunit isolated from rat testis was not found in heterodimeric combination with other common Mu-class GST subunits. As the rGSTM5, mGSTM5, and hGSTM3 subunits are structurally more closely related to each other than they are to other Mu GSTs, it is proposed that they be considered a functionally distinct and separate subfamily within class Mu. The identification of this unique mammalian GST subclass could advance strategies for interspecies comparisons of GSTs and provides a rodent model for studies on functions and regulatory mechanisms for human GSTs.

Accordingly, cytosolic mammalian GSTs are grouped in Alpha, Mu, Pi, and Theta classes on the basis of sequence homologies, subunit assembly patterns, and other common properties (6Mannervik B. Alin P. Guthenberg C. Jensson H. Tahir M.K. Warholm M. Jornvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7202-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Multiple subunit types from within each of these classes usually assemble in homo- or heterodimeric combinations. However, with the exception of GST Pi, which is usually the product of a single gene, cross-correlations among the multiple Mu- or Alpha-class GSTs in different species have been of limited success. Consequently, efforts to establish general animal models for study of structure, function, and regulation of expression of specific human GST genes have been impeded. GSTs function catalytically to conjugate GSH with a variety of electrophilic substrates (7Jakoby W.B. Ziegler D.M. J. Biol.

For instance livers of some species are rich in Alpha- and some Mu-class GSTs but do not contain Pi, yet some Mu subunits not present in liver are major components in certain extrahepatic tissues (12Rowe J.D.

Moreover, among the Mu-class GSTs, hGSTM3 is structurally unique containing 4-residue N-terminal and 3-residue C-terminal extensions. In addition, the hGSTM3gene is expressed selectively in testis and brain; otherwise that subunit is found at very low levels in most other tissues (12Rowe J.D. Nieves E. Listowsky I. Biochem.

The S-methyl 2-naphthyl GSH and S-octyl-GSH were gifts from Dr. Larry Kauvar, Terrapin Technologies, South San Francisco. Epoxy-linked GSH agarose, GSH, the S-alkyl-GSH derivatives, glutathione sulfonic acid,S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-GSH, and S-(1,2-dicarboxyethyl) GSH, were obtained from Sigma. The 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was from Aldrich, Taq polymerase from Life Technologies, Inc., and the pET3a expression vector from Stratagene. The Lys-C protease was a gift from Dr. Y. Burstein, Department of Organic Chemistry, Weizmann Institute. Cytosolic GSTs were purified from freshly removed rat or mouse testes by epoxy-linked GSH-agarose affinity chromatography (18Jensson H. Alin P. Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). GST purification and HPLC analyses were performed in the same day to avoid possible changes in protein properties. Methods for expression and purification of recombinant GSTs are described below. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed in 12% polyacrylamide resolving gels which were either stained with Coomassie Blue or prepared for immunoblotting. Resolved proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes in 12 mmTris, 96 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.3, containing 20% methanol, by electrophoresis for 1 h at 35 V using a NOVEX blotting apparatus. The membranes were blocked with 5% w/v non-fat dry milk in 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl buffer, pH 7.6 (TBS), and then incubated with specific antisera for 2 h at room temperature. The peptide sequence-specific antiserum selective for the hGSTM3 subunit was raised as described previously (13Takahashi Y. Campbell E.A. Hirata Y. Takayama T. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8893-8898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used at a dilution of 1:500. After extensive washing with TBS, the blots were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. After an additional wash, blots were developed by use of a Renaissance chemiluminescence developing kit (DuPont) and by exposure to x-ray film. A Hewlett-Packard HPLC 1090 system was used to resolve rat or mouse testicular GST subunits. Subunit separation was achieved on a Vydac C4 column by elution with acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and water containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid. Gradients were developed as follows; the gradient was begun at 20% acetonitrile, and after 10 min the percentage of acetonitrile was then increased to 40% followed by a gradient of 0.5% acetonitrile/min over 60 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. A diode array detector was used for measuring absorbances of the protein peaks at 214 and 280 nm. HPLC fractions were collected manually in separate tubes and either desiccated in a Speed-Vac or used directly for mass spectrometric analysis. Desiccated fractions were redissolved in water and used immediately for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and other analytical procedures. Protein isoelectric focusing was performed with rat testis cytosolic proteins (100 μg) and purified rat testis GSTs (25 μg) in Novex pH 3–10 precast isoelectric focusing slab gels of 5% acrylamide were used. The buffers, current, and other conditions were those recommended by the manufacturer (NOVEX) and electrofocusing was carried out for 2.5 h. The rat rGSTM5 subunit was reduced in a buffer solution containing 6 m guanidinium chloride, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. 2-Iodo[2-14C]acetic acid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 2 mCi/mmol) was added in the presence of excess unlabeled 2-iodoacetate for reaction with cysteine residues. The alkylated protein was dialyzed against of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA. Digestion with Lys-C endoproteinase was then carried out at 37 °C for 8 h in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 m urea, pH 9.0, with ratios of protease to GST of 1:100. The peptides generated were resolved and purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column. The peptides were collected, assayed by scintillation counting for the presence of 14C-radiolabeled material, and prepared for sequence analysis. An Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an Applied Biosystems 120A amino acid analyzer was used for sequence analysis of protein and peptide samples purified by HPLC methods. An API-III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE-SCIEX, Ontario, Canada) with the SCIEX Ionspray interface and nitrogen as the nebulizer gas was used for mass spectral analysis. An ionspray voltage of ∼3600 volts and an orifice voltage of 85 volts was used. Mass spectral analysis was performed either by on-line HPLC connected to the mass spectrometer or by infusion of the collected fractions using a Harvard Apparatus syringe pump. Molecular masses of individual GST subunits were determined from at least three different preparations. Enzyme assays were performed using CDNB and GSH as substrates in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer at pH values in the range of 5.8–8.0. Rates of product formation were determined by measurement of absorbances at 340 nm (18Jensson H. Alin P. Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 504-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To determine bisubstrate reaction mechanisms, the concentration of each individual substrate was maintained constant in the range of 0.02–2.0 mm, while the concentration of the other substrate was varied over the same range (0.02–2.0 mm). At these substrate concentrations, hyperbolic kinetics were observed for the reaction. Data were best-fitted to steady-state two substrate rate equations (19Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd., London1995: 143-147Google Scholar), using Milton Roy Inc. (Rochester) software. Inhibitors were tested at various concentrations at substrate concentration ranges described above. Inhibition studies were carried out at pH 6.2, which was determined to be the apparent pKa of each enzyme from plots of logkcat versus pH. For the GSH conjugates inhibition was determined to be competitive visà vis GSH, and inhibition constants (Ki) were determined from these data. GS-DNB was synthesized enzymatically in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml hGSTM3-3, 1.0 mm CDNB, and 1.0 mmGSH. Unreacted excess CDNB was extracted with ether and the water-soluble conjugate was purified using reversed-phase HPLC with a gradient of 5–65% acetonitrile on a Vydac C18 (10 × 250) column. To verify the structure of the GS-DNB conjugate, the molecular mass of the purified product was determined to be 474 ± 0.8 Da by ESI-MS, which is precisely that of the expected GS-DNB product. The concentration of the conjugate was determined spectrophotometrically on the basis of its molar extinction coefficient at 343 nm of 9.6 mm−1 cm−1. Total RNA was purified from freshly removed rat and mouse testicular tissues by use of a Promega RNA purification kit. Primers were designed based upon comparison of the reported cDNA sequence of mouse mGSTM5 (20Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Sequences of the primers were: primer 1 (sense, 30-mer), 5′-TCC ATC GCT GTA TCC CCG AAG CCA AGA TCG-3′; primer 2 (reverse, 30-mer); 5′-CCC TCA GGG CAA GAT GGC TCA GCA GCA GCG-3′. To synthesize cDNAs, reverse transcriptase (RAV-2, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the reverse primer 2 were used according to published methods (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An aliquot (2 μl) of the cDNA solution was used as a template for PCR amplification. The reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm each of dNTP, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.16 μmol of primers 1 and 2, and 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in a total volume of 100 μl. The PCR reaction was performed in 35 cycles, each one consisting of steps for denaturation (1 min, 94 °C), annealing (1 min, 55 °C), and elongation (1 min, 72 °C), followed by a final extension step (10 min, 72 °C). The product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into pCRII TA-vector (Invitrogen) according to the procedure described in the instruction manual. DNA sequencing was performed using AmpliTaq polymerase-specific primers and an Applied Biosystems automated DNA sequencer (ABI 377). Specific sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers were designed for PCR amplification and cloning of cDNAs encoding rodent and human GST subunits as follows: hGSTM3-sense, 30 mer, 5′-AGC CCG TCC ATA TGT CGT GCG AGT CGT CTA-3′; hGSTM3-antisense, 30 mer, 5′-TGC AAG TCT GGA TCC TGA TCA GCA TAC AGG-3′; rGSTM5-sense, 25 mer, 5′-AAG ATC CCC CCA TAT GTC GTG CTC C-3′, rGSTM5-antisense, 24-mer, 5′-AGA GCA GCG GGA TCC AGC TCA GCA-3′; mGSTM5-sense, 28-mer, 5′-GCC AAG ATC GCC CCA TAT GTG ATC CAA G-3′; mGSTM5-antisense, 28-mer, 5′-CTC AGC AGC AGC GGG ATC CGG CTC AGC A-3′. All sense and antisense oligonucleotides containedNdeI or BamHI restriction sites (underlined) for cloning. The PCR reactions were performed in the presence of corresponding sets of sense-antisense primers and cDNA templates under conditions stated in the previous section (“RT-PCR Analysis”). HTGT-6, a hGSTM3-cDNA probe (15Campbell E. Takahashi Y. Abramovitz M. Peretz M. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9188-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a template for hGSTM3 amplification. The PCR products were purified using Qiagen-PCR purification kit, digested with NdeI and BamHI, then ligated into the NdeI/BamHI restriction site of a pET3a expression vector. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (Novagen) were transformed by ligation mixtures and selected on ampicillin resistance media. Bacterial clones that expressed recombinant GSTs were detected by an immunoscreening procedure using anti-hGSTM3-specific antiserum under conditions described above for the immunoblot procedures. Plasmid DNAs were purified and sequenced in both directions using T7 promoter and T7 terminator oligonucleotide primers. E. coli BL21(DE3) clones carrying recombinant plasmids were used for expression of recombinant GSTs. In brief, the overnight culture of bacterial cells was diluted at a ratio of 1:100 with fresh LB medium and grown in a rotary shaker until anA540 = 0.1–0.2 was attained. The synthesis of the recombinant GST was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then the incubation was prolonged for 6–8 h at 37 °C. Longer incubation times for expression of these particular GSTs usually resulted in the formation of oxidized protein products. The bacteria were collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 ×g, washed with TBS, resuspended in the loading buffer used for GST purification, and disrupted by sonication. The soluble fraction obtained following centrifugation (30 min, 20,000 × g) was applied for protein purification by GSH affinity chromatography as mentioned above for tissue GSTs. To obtain GSH-free proteins, recombinant GSTs were dialyzed extensively against 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol, until no catalytic activity with CDNB was observed in the absence of exogenous GSH. The purity of GSTs was confirmed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by reversed-phase HPLC analysis as described above. For identification of a putative rat homologue of the human hGSTM3 subunit, rat testicular GSTs were purified and subunits resolved by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 A). Peptide sequence-specific antibodies raised against the unique C-terminal sequence of the hGSTM3 subunit (15Campbell E. Takahashi Y. Abramovitz M. Peretz M. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9188-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to survey the protein-containing HPLC eluate by immunoblot analysis. The subunit tentatively identified as rGSTM52 on the basis of its similar retention time as the hGSTM3 subunit (27.1 min) was the only component that reacted with the highly specific hGSTM3 antiserum (Fig. 1 C). To characterize further the rGSTM5 component and to substantiate rat testicular subunit assignments, the GSTs were analyzed by on-line electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The nine major peaks obtained in order of elution were: rGSTM1, rGSTM2, rGSTM6, rGSTP1, rGSTA3, rGSTM3, rGSTM5, rGSTA1, and rGSTA4 subunits as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 B) and ESI-MS (Fig. 1). The subunit masses determined by ESI-MS are shown in Fig. 1. Some molecular masses were in agreement with those calculated from the deduced sequences for rat subunits, and the molecular masses obtained for rGSTA1 and A4 were 42 Da greater than those expected from the deduced sequences, indicating that the N termini were acetylated. Complete amino acid sequences for the testicular rGSTM5 and rGSTM6 subunits have not been reported previously. The larger mass of the rGSTM5 subunit (Fig. 2) and its predominance in testicular tissue are also characteristic of the human hGSTM3 subunit. Among the Mu-class GSTs hGSTM3 is unique in that it has both N and C termini extended by several amino acid residues (15Campbell E. Takahashi Y. Abramovitz M. Peretz M. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9188-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rGSTM5 subunit comprises approximately 30% of the GST content of adult rat testis. This subunit type is also relatively abundant in rat brain where it represents over 10% of the GST composition. However in terms of absolute amounts, testis is decidedly the richest source of rGSTM5 subunits with levels of over 4.0 μg/mg of cytosolic protein, as determined by quantitative HPLC of subunit content. The levels of this subunit in adult rat testis are thus usually about 30-fold greater than the levels in brain (0.14–0.18 μg/mg of cytosolic protein). Very low amounts of the rGSTM5 subunit were present in other rat tissues including liver, kidney, heart, and lung. The rGSTM5 subunit was first purified by reversed phase HPLC, incubated with iodo[14C]acetic acid and digested to completion with Lys-C protease. Peptide fragments were resolved by HPLC, radiolabeled peptides identified, and sequences of selected peptides determined (Fig. 3 A). A sequence alignment of rGSTM5 peptides determined here, and those reported previously for rat rGSTM1 (a representative rat Mu-class subunit) and the human GSTM3 subunit are shown in Fig. 3 B. Although containing several amino acid differences, peptides obtained for the rGSTM5 subunit exhibited far greater sequence identity to the human hGSTM3 form as opposed to other rat Mu-class subunits (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of the peptide map of rGSTM5 yielded some unexpected results. For instance, a small radiolabeled peptide refractory to Edman degradation was obtained; this could be the putative N-terminal peptide that is blocked. Moreover, a large peptide (number 9: SMVLGYWDIRGLAXAIRMLLEF) had an almost identical sequence as that near the N terminus of the hGSTM3 subunit (Fig. 3 B). Cyanogen bromide cleavage of GST11-11 (Yo or rGSTM5) (17Kispert A. Meyer D.J. Lalor E. Coles B. Ketterer B. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) yielded an identical sequence between the putative CNBr cleavage site methionine residues of this particular peptide 9, and Hsieh et al. (22Hsieh C.-H. Tsai S.P. Yeh H.-I. Sheu T.-C. Tam M.F. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) recently found this peptide after protease digestion of a rat testicular GST. Those authors were apparently unaware that the N-terminal sequence of this subunit extends beyond that of other Mu-class subunits and assumed that this peptide was near the N terminus of the GST with the first methionine at position 2. However, from the mass of the rGSTM5 subunit (Fig. 2), it is likely that it contains extended N and C termini, so the origin of peptide 9 (Fig. 3 A) remained unclear. In addition, the sequence of a tetrapeptide near the C terminus terminated at a lysine residue (WGNK, peptide 1; Fig. 3 A), so that the rGSTM5 cannot contain the Lys-Pro linkage found in the hGSTM3 subunit (see Fig. 3 B), which is refractory to the Lys-C cleavage. A cDNA clone for a mouse sperm fibrous sheath GST (mGSTM5) was recently identified (20Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The mGSTM5 subunit has not been purified hitherto, although a testis-specific GST designated Ft by Lee (23Lee C.Y. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 49: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) may correspond to this form. Mouse testis GSTs were therefore resolved by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 4). The subunit eluting at 26 min (similar to the retention time of rGSTM5 and hGSTM3 subunits) was the only mouse GST that cross-reacted with hGSTM3 peptide sequence-specific antisera and was found by ESI-MS to have a molecular mass of 26,546 Da (Fig. 4, inset). It is interesting to note that Mitchell et al. (24Koehler R.T. Villar H.O. Bauer K.E. Higgins D.L. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) did not detect this higher molecular weight subunit of testis in an HPLC-MS survey of mouse tissue GSTs purified using S-hexyl-GSH affinity matrices. This mass is greater than that of other GSTs and agrees with the molecular mass calculated from the deduced primary structure of the mouse fibrous sheath GST (20Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ESI-MS result also confirmed that the N and C termini are indeed extended for the translated mouse testicular protein product. On the basis of these findings, it was important to determine the complete amino acid sequence of the rat rGSTM5 subunit. Total RNAs were therefore obtained from fresh rat and mouse testicular tissue, and primers designed on the basis of knownhGSTM3 and mGSTM5 sequences were used for RT-PCR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The cDNAs of both mousemGSTM5 and rat rGSTM5 were obtained using the RT-PCR methods and their sequences determined. The sequence found for the mGSTM5 cDNA was identical to that published previously (20Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 A shows the sequence of the rGSTM5 open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence of rGSTM5 is compared with those of hGSTM3 and mGSTM5 subunits in Fig. 5 B. It is noteworthy that the rGSTM5 subunit has 97% sequence identity to the deduced amino acid sequence for mGSTM5 (20Fulcher K.D. Welch J.E. Klapper D.G. O'Brien D.A. Eddy E.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and 88% identity to the sequence of the hGSTM3 subunit (15Campbell E. Takahashi Y. Abramovitz M. Peretz M. Listowsky I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9188-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sequence hom"

Previous reports presented evidence that its maximal expression requires disruption of mitochondrial respiration and that it plays a role in the response to oxidative stress. We have studied the expression of YHB1 in respiratory deficient cells and in cells exposed to various compounds causing oxidative stress. Several different strains and approaches (spectroscopic detection of the oxygenated form of Yhb1p, β-galactosidase activity of a YHB1-lacZ fusion, and Northern blot analysis) were used to demonstrate that YHB1 expression and Yhb1p production are not increased by respiration deficiency. YHB1 expression was unchanged in cells challenged with antimycin A or menadione, while it decreased in cells exposed to H2O2, diamide, dithiothreitol, and Cu2+. Transcription of YHB1 is not under the control of the transcriptional factor Yap1p. These results do not support a participation of YHB1 in the genetic response to oxidative stress. We also analyzed the growth phenotypes associated with altered Yhb1p production using YHB1-deleted strains and strains that greatly overproduced Yhb1p. Yhb1p appears to protect cells against the damage caused by Cu2+ and dithiothreitol, while sensitizing them to H2O2.

Hemoglobins (Hbs) 1The abbreviations used are: Hb, hemoglobin; HbO2, oxyhemoglobin; flavoHb, flavohemoglobin; Yhb1p, yeast flavohemoglobin; DTT, dithiothreitol; CO, carbon monoxide; KCN, potassium cyanide. are very ancient hemoproteins that are widely distributed in nature; they are found in all groups of organisms, including many invertebrates, plants, fungi, and bacteria (1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). They all bind reversibly molecular oxygen, but their avidities vary greatly. The hemoglobin from the wormAscaris binds oxygen 4 orders of magnitude more tightly than does human Hb (2Goldberg D.E. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some hemoglobins bind other molecules besides oxygen; the Hbs from the mollusc Lucina pectinata (3Rizzi M. Wittenberg J.B. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the deep-sea hydrothermal vent worm Riftia pachyptila (4Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) bind hydrogen sulfide and transport it to the sulfur-oxidizing bacterial symbionts which feed them. Hbs also vary greatly in size and composition, from the single-domain monomeric myoglobin to the complex heteromultimeric Riftia Hbs (4Zal F. Lallier F.H. Wall J.S. Vinogradov S.N. Toulmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8869-8874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); but their heme-binding domains all seem to have retained the characteristic “globin fold,” although there are subtle variations in the amino acid residues lining the heme pocket, and these are responsible for the differences in their properties (Refs. 1Hardison R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5675-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Goldberg D.E. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 3Rizzi M. Wittenberg J.B. Coda A. Ascenzi P. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references therein). Hb is normally involved in oxygen transport, storage, and facilitated diffusion, as is well established in animals. In plants, the specialized leghemoglobins transport oxygen in the nodules during symbiotic nitrogen fixation, while the nonsymbiotic Hbs presumably facilitate oxygen diffusion in actively respiring cells (5Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These Hbs are expressed in several tissues with high metabolic activity (5Andersson C.R. Jensen E.O. Llewellyn D.J. Dennis E.S. Peacock W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5682-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and, in barley, they are induced by hypoxia and by inhibitors of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (6Nie X. Hill R.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The homodimeric Hb from the obligately aerobic bacterium Vitreoscilla, whose synthesis is strongly stimulated in hypoxic conditions, probably plays a role in facilitation of oxygen diffusion or in oxygen delivery (7Wakabayashi S. Matsubara H. Webster D.A. Nature. 1986; 322: 481-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 8Khosla C. Bailey J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The overproduction of Vitreoscilla Hb in such hosts asEscherichia coli (9Tsai P.S. Hatzimanikatis V. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1996; 49: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), yeast (10Chen W. Hughes D.E. Bailey J.E. Biotechnol. Prog. 1994; 10: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and plants (11Holmberg N. Lilius G. Bailey J.E. Bulow L. Nature Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), enhanced growth metabolism by increasing the availability of oxygen and/or the supply of ATP in the cells. A class of intriguing Hbs, the flavohemoglobins, has recently been described in yeast and in several bacteria. These “two-domain” globins contain an N-terminal globin module fused to a reductase module that is homologous to the ferredoxin-NADPH reductase family, with one FAD and one NAD(P)H-binding domains (12Vasudevan S.G.

Their physiological function remains uncertain and the published data on them are often confusing. The flavoHb in Erwinia chrysanthemi is essential for pathogenicity (16Favey S. Labesse G. Vouille V. Boccara M. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 863-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The flavoHbs of the denitrifierAlcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis, and E. coli are all induced by nitrate and nitrite under anaerobic conditions (15Cramm R. Siddiqui R.A. Friedrich B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7349-7354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lacelle M. Kumano M. Kurita K. Yamane K. Zuber P. Nakano M.M. J.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); nitric oxide also induces expression of the E. coli flavoHb (19Poole R.K. Anjum M.F. Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role of these flavoHbs in the anaerobic metabolism of nitrogen oxide compounds, but the way in which they act is not known. In vitro studies on purified E. coli flavoHb suggest that it may function as an NADH oxidase (20Poole R.K. Ioannidis N. Orii Y. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the release of superoxide anions (21Membrillo-Hernandez J. Ioannidis N. Poole R.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), or also as a reductase (22Poole R.K. Rogers N.J. D'mello R.A.M. Hughes M.N. Orii Y. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), acting perhaps as an oxygen sensor in vivo. E. coli flavoHb has also been implicated in oxidative stress: it produces superoxide in vivo when overproduced (21Membrillo-Hernandez J. Ioannidis N. Poole R.K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and its expression is induced by the redox cyclic agent, paraquat, which generates intracellular superoxide (23Membrillo-Hernandez J. Kim S. Cook G.M. Poole R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3164-3170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hb was first identified in yeasts by Keilin (24Keilin D. Nature. 1953; 172: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The flavoHb ofCandida mycoderma has a very high affinity for oxygen, similar to that of cytochrome oxidase but a thousand times higher than that of human Hb (but with same oxygen dissociation rate constant); there is no evidence that it facilitates oxygen diffusion in the cells (25Oshino R. Oshino N. Chance B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Oshino R. Asakura T. Takio K. Oshino N. Chance B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 39: 581-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the expression of the gene YHB1, encoding the flavoHb in this yeast, is regulated by the growth phase and oxygen in a manner opposite to that found in most bacteria, suggesting that it has a different function in this yeast (27Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fact that cells deleted of YHB1 become sensitive to some conditions promoting oxidative stress, and that these conditions also enhance YHB1 expression suggest that Yhb1p contributes to the response to oxidative stress (28Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This study explores the regulation of YHB1 gene expression by respiration and by different agents that cause oxidative stress (H2O2, diamide, menadione, DTT, Cu2+), and the effect of a lack or excess of Yhb1p on sensitivity of cells to these various stresses. The S. cerevisiaestrains used in this study are described in Table I. The rho −derivatives were prepared by growing the cells in the presence of ethidium bromide (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). The YHB1 gene (reading frame YGR234w of chromosome VII (36Tettelin H. et al.Nature. 1997; 387: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) was disrupted by “γ-transformation” (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using routine DNA manipulation procedures (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two DNA fragments (nucleotides −679 to +7 and +990 to +1202; the A of the initiating ATG is +1) flanking the coding region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using yeast genomic DNA, and cloned into the plasmid pRS403 (31Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in tandem, but in reverse order, leaving an EcoRI site between them. After linearization at this site, the construct was transformed into yeast cells by a modified lithium acetate method (38Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2898) Google Scholar). Integration of the deleted/disruptedyhb1-Δ1::HIS3 allele at the proper locus was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of whole cells (39Amberg D.C. Botstein D. Beasley E.M.

The coding region of YHB1 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from yeast genomic DNA using forward (5′-CGCGGATCCATTCATTatgCTAGCCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CCGGAATTCCGCctaAACTTGCACGG-3′) primers containing sequences for BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined) and the initiating ATG and stop TAG codons (in lowercase type), respectively. The resulting DNA fragment was inserted into the polylinker of the multicopy expression vectors pYADE4 and pYPGE2 (40Brunelli J.P. Pall M.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This placed the expression of YHB1 under the control of the glucose-regulatable ADH2 or the constitutive PGK1promoters. The entire YHB1 sequence was verified by sequencing using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). TheYHB1-lacZ fusion was constructed by ligating a polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA fragment encompassing 679 nucleotides of the 5′-untranslated region and the first two codons of YHB1to the lacZ gene of the episomal YEp357 plasmid (41Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C with vigorous agitation (200 rpm) on a platform shaker (Infors Multitron, Bottmingen, Switzerland). Milder agitation (160 rpm in a Infors Aquatron water bath) was used for the experiments on sensitivity to oxidative stress. Rich media contained 1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% Bacto-peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose (YPglu), or 2% galactose (YPgal). Synthetic complete media contained 0.67% Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco), 0,1% casamino acids (Difco), appropriate nutrients (Ura, Ade, Trp) at 20 mg/liter, 2% glucose (SCglu), or 2% glycerol + 2% ethanol (SCgly). Tween 80 (0.2%) and ergosterol (30 mg/liter) were added for culturing heme-deficient cells and for anaerobic growth carried out in special air-tight flasks equipped with ground joints, outlets, and a mercury valve (29Amillet J.M. Buisson N. Labbe-Bois R. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); flasks were bubbled with nitrogen for 30 min after inoculating the medium. Cultures were inoculated with fresh precultures in exponential growth phase in the same medium. Growth was followed by measuring optical density at 600 nm (OD600) in a Kontron Uvikon 860 spectrophotometer; one OD600 equals 0.3 mg dry weight of cells/ml, or 107 cells/ml. Cells were collected in the logarithmic growth phase (OD600 = 0.3–1.5) and used immediately; they were stored at −80 °C for extracting RNA. The oxygen consumption of whole cells was monitored at 30 °C with a Clark-type electrode in 67 mmKH2PO4, using glucose or ethanol as the respiratory substrate. KCN was used at a concentration of 2 mm final. Respiration is expressed as nanomole of O2/min/mg dry weight of cells. β-Galactosidase activity was measured on chloroform-permeabilized cells grown in selective minimal medium (SCglu -ura) at OD600 = 0.3–0.5 (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). It is expressed as Miller units (A420 nm × 1000/min/OD600). The values reported are the averages of duplicate determinations of at least two separate cultures, each inoculated with 10–12 independent transformants. Total RNA (15 μg), isolated from cells in exponential growth (42Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), was electrophoresed on agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to nylon membranes, and probed with 32P-labeled DNA fragments under standard conditions (35Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar, 37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probes were a 1.2-kilobaseBamHI-EcoRI fragment from plasmid pPGE/YHB1 for the YHB1 gene, and a 1.1-kilobaseXhoI-HindIII fragment of the actin geneACT1 used to monitor RNA loading. The autoradiograms were quantified by scanning densitometry. The whole cell cytochrome content was estimated by low temperature (liquid nitrogen) spectrophotometry of cells (40 mg dry weight) filtered from liquid cultures in exponential growth phase (43Labbe-Bois R. Rytka J. Litwinska J. Bilinski T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 156: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), using a Leres S-66 spectrophotometer. The filtered cells were also resuspended in 5 ml of water, bubbled with CO for 5 min, or treated with sodium dithionite (a few grains) or KCN (5 mm final), and the treated cells processed for spectrophotometric analysis as above. This rapid, reliable method allowed the direct, quantitative comparison of the cytochrome and hemoglobin contents of different cells. The total heme contents of whole cells and mitochondrial membranes were quantified from the reduced-minus-oxidized difference spectra of the pyridine hemochromes (44Urban-Grimal D. Labbe-Bois R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1981; 183: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared after mechanical disruption of the cells (45Abbas A. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8541-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Low temperature spectra of whole cells ofS. cerevisiae often have an absorption band near 575–577 nm which we attributed previously to porphyrins and Zn-porphyrins (46Labbe-Bois R. Labbe P. Dailey H.A. Biosynthesis of Heme and Chlorophylls. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1990: 235-285Google Scholar). We have now shown that this band is in fact due to the oxygenated form of the flavohemoglobin Yhb1p. It disappears after cells are reduced with sodium dithionite and is replaced by a more diffuse band at 568–570 nm in cells treated with carbon monoxide (CO) (Fig. 1), which is characteristic of a hemoprotein that combines reversibly with molecular oxygen. The band at 575 nm is also absent from S/ΔHB cells lacking the YHB1gene (ΔYhb1), and reappears when these cells are transformed with a plasmid expressing YHB1 (pADE/YHB1) (Fig. 1). Identical results were obtained with the strains YPH499 and W303-1B and their ΔYhb1 derivatives. Control experiments withhem12 mutant cells partially deficient in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (47Zoladek T. Chelstowska A. Labbe-Bois R. Rytka J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 247: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that the peak at 575 nm due to the accumulated Zn-porphyrins does not change when cells are treated with dithionite or CO (data not presented). Yhb1p is found mainly in rho − cells and in cells growing in the presence of antimycin A. It was therefore proposed that its expression is activated by the disruption of mitochondrial respiration (13Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 4180-4186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have examined the effects of respiratory deficiency on the presence of Yhb1p, detected by the absorption at 575 nm of its oxygenated form, in parallel with the expression of the YHB1gene estimated by Northern blot and the activity of aYHB1-lacZ fusion. Strains S150-2B and W303-1B were grown in a glucose medium in the presence of antimycin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, or chloramphenicol, an inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis (for S150-2B, cells in the rho − state were used, as these are phenotypically similar to cells grown with chloramphenicol). Full derepression of the respiratory chain was achieved by growth with glycerol + ethanol. In contrast to S150-2B cells (Fig. 1), the peak at 575 nm was very small or absent in the low temperature spectra of W303-1B grown in glucose, unless the cells were treated with KCN (Fig. 2 A, curves 1). This is because the W303-1B cells have a greater respiratory activity than S150-2B cells, and “cyanide, by inhibiting the reoxidation of the reduced components of cytochrome, prevents the utilization of oxygen in yeast respiration and thus protects oxyhemoglobin from deoxygenation” (24Keilin D. Nature. 1953; 172: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). KCN must also be added to observe the band at 575 nm in fully derepressed cells grown in glycerol + ethanol (Fig. 2 A, curve 4, and Fig. 3 B), and the further addition of dithionite or CO abolished or displaced it as was shown in Fig. 1.Figure 3Low temperature absorption spectra of whole cells overexpressing Yhb1p. S150-2B (WT) and S150-2B cells transformed with pPGE/YHB1 were grown aerobically in synthetic medium containing glucose (panel A) or glycerol + ethanol (panel B), or anaerobically in synthetic glucose medium (panel C). Spectra were recorded as described in the legend to Fig. 1, with untreated cells or cells treated with carbon monoxide (CO), dithionite (Red), or KCN. The two spectra for each strain shown in panel C correspond to the different experiments described in Tables III and IV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Disrupting the mitochondrial respiration with antimycin A or chloramphenicol did not appear to increase the intensity of the absorption band at 575 nm (Fig. 2 A, curves 2 and 3), indicating no activation of the YHB1 gene. This is confirmed by the lack of any significant change in the steady-state amount of YHB1 mRNA (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–3), or in the activity of a YHB1-lacZ fusion (Table II). YHB1 expression was decreased to about 60% of the control value in the rho − derivative of strain S150-2B (Fig. 2 B, lane 3 and Table II). Growing the cells in glycerol + ethanol slightly increased the amounts of YHB1 mRNA (Fig. 2 B, lane 4) and caused a 2.5–3.5-fold increase in β-galactosidase activity (Table II), confirming that glucose exerts very little, if any, repression on YHB1 expression (27Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Heme-deficiency and anaerobiosis both reduced considerably the expression of YHB1, but to different extents (Table II), as described previously (27Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 28Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Our results clearly show that mitochondrial respiratory activity need not be disrupted for optimal expression of YHB1 and the production of the holoprotein. The reported absence of Yhb1p in respiratory-proficient cells (13Zhu H. Riggs A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5015-5019Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) is probably due to the fact that the cells were in late stationary phase: because the concentration ofYHB1 mRNA drops sharply upon exit from the exponential growth (27Crawford M.J. Sherman D.R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6991-6996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), Yhb1p is probably diluted out during the oxidative diauxic growth, what would not occur in respiratory deficient cells. The effects of deleting the flavohemoglobin gene on cell growth and sensitivity to oxidative stress have been described (28Zhao X.-J. Raitt D. Burke P.V. Clewell A.S. Kwast K.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25131-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). But the effects of Yhb1p overproduction have not previously been reported. Cells overexpressing Yhb1p from the plasmid pPGE/YHB1 exhibited a red-brown tint when collected. They grew a little slower than control cells carrying the vector pYPGE2 (Table III), but reached the same final cell density. For instance, the increase in doubling time was 14% for the strain S150-2B and 7% for the strain W303-1B growing in glucose synthetic medium. Overproducing Yhb1p might be detrimental to the cells, and this is consistent with plasmid loss experiments showing that 80–85% of the cells contained the plasmid pYPGE2, but only 32–36% contained pPGE/YHB1 at the end of the culture on glucose rich medium.Table IIIEffect of Yhb1p overexpression on heme and cytochrome synthesisGrowth conditionsPlasmidDoubling timeRespirationTotal hemeWhole cellsMembraneshnmol O2/min/mg dry wtnmol/g dry wtpmol/mgGlu, O2pYPGE22.35.66650pPGE/YHB12.61.415111Gly, O2pYPGE24.650207289pPGE/YHB15.552360154Glu,"

To identify the RNA motifs in the apoB mRNA that support physiological editing and those that support aberrant hyperediting, we constructed rabbit apoB RNA substrates and tested them in vitro for physiological editing and hyperediting. Three previously unrecognized RNA elements that are critical for efficient physiological editing at C6666 were identified.

The T7 promoter sequence with GGA (5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGA-3′) added to achieve efficient expression was incorporated into the PCR constructs by a second PCR amplification. RNA was produced by the T7-MEGA shortscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was analyzed by agarose gels, treated with DNase 1, and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The names of the RNAs refer to the first nucleotide of the RNA according to the apoB cDNA position (e.g. B6629 starts at nt 6629), and the length of the RNAs is given in nucleotides. The DNA constructs for the P1 (GenBank™ accession numberX62154) and the N-myc RNA (GenBank™ accession numberM12731) were produced by reverse transcription-PCR from normal mouse liver RNA. The primers for the N-myc amplification were MU6879:5′-ACGGCCTGTATACTTTTGTATG-3′ and ML7053:5′-AACAAATACAGTAAACAAGGAA-3′. For the P1 amplification, the primers were P1U1279:5′-GCCCGCTGCAGTGTTTTGG-3′ and P1L1454:5′-CCCTGTATTGGTGCATCCTAA-3′. The N-myc and the P1-PCR fragments were TA subcloned (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and sequenced. Chimeric RNAs were produced from PCR-derived DNA constructs by recombinant PCR (25Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified, and the RNAs were produced as described for the apoB RNAs. Substitution mutagenesis was accomplished by incorporating the alterations in the primers used to produce the PCR constructs. The chimeric RNA MS-P1 (196 nt) consists of 58 nt of apoB RNA (6629–6686) and 138 nt of P1 RNA (1337–1474). The N-mycchimeric RNA MS-M (197 nt) has 58 nt of apoB RNA (6629–6686) and 139 nt of N-myc RNA (6936–7074). The second set of N-myc chimeric RNAs used the 138-nt N-myc RNA MY (6859–6996) as a control. M-MOOR-M (138 nt) has 51 nt of N-myc RNA (6859–6909), 26 nt of apoB RNA (6662–6687), and 61 nt of N-myc RNA (6936–6996). EFF-MOOR-EFF (138 nt) has 20 nt of apoB RNA (6609–6628), 31 nt of N-myc RNA (6879–6909), 26 nt of apoB RNA (6662–6687), 30 nt of N-myc(6936–6965), and 31 nt of apoB RNA (6717–6747). The third set consists of the F-M-F RNA (139 nt), which has 53 nt of apoB RNA (6609–6661), 26 nt of N-myc RNA (6910–6935), and 60 nt of apoB RNA (6688–6747). M-F RNA (137 nt) has 77 nt of N-mycRNA (6859–6935) and 60 nt of apoB RNA (6688–6747). F-M RNA (140 nt) has 53 nt of apoB RNA (6609–6661) and 87 nt of N-myc RNA (6910–6996). EFF-M-EFF RNA (137 nt) has 20 nt of apoB RNA (6609–6628), 86 nt of N-myc RNA (6879–6964), and 31 nt of apoB RNA (6717–6747). The fourth set of apoB/N-myc chimeric RNAs used the 196-nt N-myc RNA M (6879–7074) as a control. M-B6747 has 118 nt of N-myc RNA (6879–6996) and 78 nt of apoB RNA (6747–6824). The PCR templates for all the apoB/N-myc chimeric RNAs were sequenced. For the in vitro apoB mRNA editing assay (26Driscoll D.M. Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J. Cell. 1989; 58: 519-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), 100 pg of synthetic RNA prepared as described above, 100 μg of rabbit liver S100 extract, 5 μg of recombinant APOBEC-1 (MBP-APOBEC-1) (21Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Driscoll D.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11506-11510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 1 μg ofEscherichia coli tRNA, and 40 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) in buffer D containing 1 mm dithiothreitol in a reaction volume of 100 μl were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times and then extracted as described (26Driscoll D.M. Wynne J.K. Wallis S.C. Scott J. Cell. 1989; 58: 519-525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In control experiments, the RNAs were incubated in this assay mixture lacking rabbit liver S100 extract. All RNAs were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR, and the resulting single-band PCR products were purified over a microspin S-300 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primer extension was performed essentially as described (1Boström K. Garcia Z. Poksay K.S. Johnson D.F. Lusis A.J. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22446-22452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Except in the experiments with primers PE6762, PE6782/3, and PE6802, the coding strand instead of the noncoding strand was analyzed for hyperediting. For these experiments, 1 mm each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP and 5 mm ddCTP were used for the poisonous primer extension. The extent of editing was determined with a radioanalytic imaging system (AMBIS, San Diego, CA). The primers used for primer extension in apoB were M51 at C6666 (5′-ATCATAACTACTTTTAATATACTG-3′), PE6738R at C6738 (5′-ATTTTTAATTTTTCCATGAT-3′), PE6743R at C6743 (5′-GTTCATCAAGAATTTTTAAT-3′), PE6762 at C6762 (5′-TAGATCAAATCATGGAAAAA-3′), PE6782/3 at C6782 and C6783 (5′-AATTCTTGATGAACGTTATC-3′), PE6802 at C6802 (5′-TATCATATCCGTGCACATTT-3′), and PEMOORL65 (5′-AATTTCATACGCTTTAATATACTG-3′) for C6666 in the apoB/N-myc chimeric RNAs containing the apoB editing cassette (designated MOOR). The primer used to detect editing in N-myc was MPE6914R at C6914(5′-TACGAAAATATAAGTATCAA-3′). The percentage of editing is given as the mean plus and minus the deviation of n experiments. To investigate the influence of distal flanking sequences on editing of C6666 and hyperediting of C6802 in the apoB mRNA, we used an in vitro editing assay of small apoB RNAs. The RNAs were produced by in vitrotranscription and incubated in the presence of rabbit liver extract (as a source of auxiliary proteins) and an excess of recombinant APOBEC-1. The percentage of editing of a specific cytidine was then determined by primer extension analysis. To determine the impact of downstream elements on physiological editing of C6666, we first generated RNAs with 3′ sequences of different lengths (Fig. 1). Editing at C6666 was determined in an in vitro editing assay after 1, 2, 4, and 16 h. The parental RNA B6507 (354 nt) was highly edited (82%) after 16 h (Fig. 1). Editing of smaller RNAs was similar; even B6629Δ-77 (119 nt) was edited to 77% after 16 h of incubation. However, removal of an additional 31 nt at the 3′ end (6717–6747) decreased editing by almost half. We termed this 31-nt spanning region located 51–81 nt downstream of C6666 the “3′ efficiency element.” That the loss of editing efficiency was not simply due to the length of the RNA was shown by using the N-myc chimeric RNA MS-M (197 nt) and the P1 chimeric RNA MS-P1 (196 nt) in which sequences 3′ of the mooring sequence were replaced with N-myc or P1 sequences. The AU-rich apoB/N-myc RNA and B6629Δ-118 were edited to a similar extent. The GC-rich apoB/P1 RNA was marginally edited (MS-P1, Fig. 1). To investigate the influence of upstream flanking regions on editing of C6666, we transcribed small RNAs lacking the 3′ efficiency element. RNAs starting at nt 6609 (e.g. B6609 (78 nt) and B6609L (98 nt)) were edited with the same efficiency as the parental construct B6507, resulting in 80–90% editing within 4 h of incubation (Fig. 2). However, deletion of 20 nt in the 5′ end resulted in a 50% decrease in editing after 16 h of incubation (Fig. 2, B6629Δ-108 (88 nt) and B6629Δ-118 (78 nt)). The size of the RNA was not responsible for the difference in editing, because B6629Δ-118 and B6609 are the same length (78 nt). Thus, the difference in editing efficiency was due to the RNA element 6609–6628, located 38–57 nt upstream of C6666, which we termed the “5′ efficiency element.” Because RNAs lacking the 5′ efficiency element were still edited to about 50% of the wild-type level after 16 h, we deleted more 5′ sequences to define closer regions that promote editing at C6666. Additional deletion of 12 nt from the 5′ end resulted in an RNA, B6641 (46 nt), that was edited only to 7% (n = 3) after 16 h of incubation (data not shown), indicating the importance of a second region 26–37 nt upstream of C6666 for efficient editing at C6666. This second region is A-rich (AAAUGAAAAA), and mutations in this A-rich region (6629–6640) revealed that three A → U and three A → G substitutions decreased editing at C6666 (data not shown). However, introduction of a mooring sequence (UGAUCAGUAUA) returned editing efficiency to high levels (65% after 16 h (data not shown)). To distinguish further whether the 5′ and 3′ efficiency elements are part of the minimal flanking requirement for efficient physiological editing at C6666 or whether they are specific enhancer elements for physiological editing, we made chimeric apoB/N-myc RNAs (Fig. 3). Previous deletion and mutagenesis experiments indicated that the 26-nt apoB editing cassette, including C6666 and the mooring sequence, is sufficient for low level editing in certain heterologous RNA contexts (10Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6007-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Shah R.R. Knott T.J. Legros J.E. Navaratnam N. Greeve J.C. Scott J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore exchanged sequences flanking this apoB-editing cassette with N-myc sequences, resulting in 20 ± 14% (M-MOOR-M) editing at C6666 after 16 h. This represents about 25% of the editing activity detected in the parental apoB RNA (B6609C). However, chimeric RNAs containing the apoB 5′ efficiency element were edited to wild-type levels (EFF-MOOR-M and EFF-MOOR-EFF), emphasizing the importance of the 5′ efficiency element (6609–6628) for efficient mooring-dependent editing. Adding the 3′ efficiency element (6717–6747) did not further increase editing efficiency when the 5′ efficiency element was present (EFF-MOOR-EFF), but in the absence of the 5′ efficiency element, the 3′ efficiency element increased editing 2-fold (M-MOOR-EFF). These data indicate that in combination with the apoB editing cassette, the 5′ efficiency element and to a lesser extend the 3′ efficiency element restored editing at C6666 to wild-type levels. Our data indicate that efficient physiological editing at C6666 is enhanced by both the 5′ efficiency element (38–57 nt upstream) and by the 3′ efficiency element (51–81 nt downstream). If these apoB elements enhance editing at C6666, they may promote hyperediting in N-myc RNA containing a mooring-like motif. To test this possibility, we exchanged the 26-nt apoB editing cassette for the equivalent N-myc sequences (Fig. 4). The N-myc RNA (MY) was not hyperedited, although it contains mooring-like motifs and its AU content is equivalent to that of apoB RNA. When the apoB 5′ and 3′ efficiency elements were added to the N-myc RNA, no hyperediting was detected (Fig. 4, EFF-M-EFF). Thus, the apoB 5′ and 3′ efficiency elements promote editing in combination with the apoB editing cassette (Fig. 3). However, providing the entire apoB upstream flanking region (6609–6661), including the 5′ efficiency element (F-M) or the entire apoB downstream flanking region (6688–6747), including the 3′ efficiency element (M-F), resulted in hyperediting of one (C6914) or two cytidines (C6914 and C6909) in the N-myc RNA. The flanking regions of the editing cassette in the apoB RNA therefore act as recognition elements for hyperediting of a cytidine in the N-myc RNA context. Because we hypothesized that several elements in the apoB mRNA could function as recognition elements and could support mooring-dependent editing (22Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we examined the influence of the more downstream apoB RNA element, B6747, on hyperediting of the N-myc RNA (Fig. 4). The apoB sequence applied in these chimeric RNAs does not cover sequences relevant for efficient editing of C6666, but B6747 starts directly downstream of the 3′ efficiency element mapped above. Again, this longer N-myc RNA (M) was not hyperedited (Fig. 4). In M-B6747, however, the substitution of 78 nt of apoB RNA (B6747) in the N-myc RNA caused editing of two cytidines 5′ of the N-myc mooring-like motif (Fig. 4). These results indicate that an element in the apoB RNA more than 81 nt downstream of C6666 influences editing. Our data indicate that both upstream and downstream flanking regions contribute to editing of C6666. To compare these findings to hyperediting, we first mapped in vitro the minimal upstream sequence required for hyperediting of C6802 (Fig. 5). B6629 includes C6666, the mooring sequence downstream, and the region with the clustered cytidines that are hyperedited in the apoB mRNA from transgenic mice overexpressing APOBEC-1. All cytidines investigated in B6629 (196 nt) were hyperedited in vitro in a pattern similar to that observed in vivo (21Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Driscoll D.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11506-11510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). At C6802 the level of hyperediting was 4.9 ± 1.7% (n = 3). Deletion of the mooring sequence (Fig. 5,B6687, 138 nt) abolished hyperediting at C6743and increased hyperediting 2-fold at C6802 (11.8 ± 4%, n = 3). Deletion of an additional 60 nt of 5′ sequences (Fig. 5, B6747, 78 nt) resulted in the loss of combined hyperediting of C6782 and C6783(C6782/3), but C6802 was still hyperedited (4.2 ± 1.5%, n = 3). However, deletion of an additional 13 nt at the 5′ end abolished hyperediting at C6802 (Fig. 5, B6760, 65 nt), indicating that sequences 42–55 nt upstream are essential for hyperediting at this site. Intriguingly, the sequence 42–55 nt upstream of C6802 is AU-rich (AAAAAUUAAAA), similar to the A-rich region (AAAUGAAAAA) that contributes to physiological editing of C6666. Furthermore, the AU-rich sequence contains a cryptic polyadenylation signal (AUUAAA). We tested the possibility that the cryptic polyadenylation motif (6752–6757) influences hyperediting of C6802, because we and others have shown a link between editing and activation of this cryptic polyadenylation signal in the apoB mRNA (5Chen S.-H. Habib G. Yang C.-Y. Gu Z.-W. Lee B.R. Weng S.-A. Silberman S.R. Cai S.-J. Deslypere J.P. Rosseneu M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Li W.-H. Chan L.

Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 2200-2211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 78-nt apoB RNA, B6747, contains the cryptic polyadenylation signal (Fig. 6). Mutation of the cryptic polyadenylation signal to AUUAUA by the substitution of a U for A did not diminish hyperediting of C6802 in UB6747 (Fig. 6). Moreover, in the MB6747 RNA, the replacement of the cryptic polyadenylation signal with a mooring sequence (UGAUCAGUAUA) had no effect on hyperediting of C6802. Therefore, the cryptic polyadenylation signal (AUUAAA) itself is not necessary for hyperediting at C6802. However, three A → G substitutions in this region abolished hyperediting at C6802 (Fig. 6,GB6747). Thus, there appears to be a preference, if not a necessity, for an AU-rich sequence in this 5′-flanking region 42–55 nt upstream of C6802. To investigate the importance of the mooring-like motif (6809–6819) downstream of C6802, we used the constructs shown in Fig. 7. This mooring-like motif is located five nucleotides from the 3′ end of all short apoB RNAs investigated and is the only mooring-like motif downstream of C6802. In rabbit apoB RNA, this mooring-like motif matches only six out of the 11 nucleotides in the mooring sequence and has a 6-nt instead of a 4-nt spacer region (Fig. 7). In the 138-nt B6687 RNA template, all of the cytidines investigated were hyperedited except for C6743(Fig. 7). Scrambling the mooring-like motif at 6809–6819 (B6687S) decreased editing at C6802 to 33% of the level of the parental RNA (B6687). Furthermore, scrambling of the mooring-like motif (B6687S) and deletion of this region (B6687Δ-16) abolished hyperediting of C6782/3. In contrast, both mutations only slightly decreased hyperediting at C6762 and at other hyperedited cytidines. For example, C6762 was hyperedited to 9–15% in the mutated RNAs, which is slightly less than in the parental RNA (19%). Therefore, the mooring-like motif at 6809–6819 influenced hyperediting of cytidines up to 27 nt upstream, but hyperediting of C6762, located 47 nt upstream, was unaffected by this mooring-like motif. To investigate this mooring-like motif at 6809–6819 without the influence of distal elements, we concentrated on the smallest apoB RNA template, B6747, that was still hyperedited at C6802. In contrast to the 138-nt B6687S RNA (Fig. 7), where scrambling of the mooring-like motif decreased hyperediting of C6802, in the smaller 78-nt RNA B6747S, the same mutations abolished hyperediting at C6802 (Fig. 8). Changing the mooring-like motif to an exact 11-nt mooring sequence (B6747M) motif enhanced editing of C6802 2-fold. Furthermore, restoring the pattern of the mooring-like motif with an extra A in the spacer region (B6747R) between the mooring-like motif and C6802had no effect on hyperediting of C6802. These results indicate that an AU-rich sequence is not sufficient to support hyperediting at C6802 unless it resembles the mooring sequence. An AU-rich element and the mooring-like motif support hyperediting of C6802, but downstream elements also influence hyperediting. B6760 (65 nt) was not hyperedited at C6802 because it lacks the AU-rich element (Fig. 9). When constructs were generated that transcribed the B6760 RNA with either 28 or 58 nt of additional 3′ sequences, only the longer transcript was hyperedited at C6802. Thus, if the AU-rich element is not present, hyperediting at C6802 requires that the 3′-flanking region include sequences 51–80 nt downstream (6853–6882) of the hyperedited site. Previous studies indicated that several sequence elements are needed for efficient editing of apoB mRNA. For example, small apoB RNAs and chimeric RNAs with only 26–63 nt of specific apoB sequence were edited inefficiently (11Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L.M. Martinez D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7288-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Boström K.

Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 267-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Specifically, in the GC-rich apoE RNA, 63 nt of specific apoB mRNA were not edited (15Boström K. Lauer S.J. Poksay K.S. Garcia Z. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when 354 nt of specific apoB sequence were translocated into the same locus of the apoE mRNA, wild-type levels of editing were detected, indicating that all sequence requirements for efficient editing at C6666 are present within this segment (15Boström K. Lauer S.J. Poksay K.S. Garcia Z. Taylor J.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this in vitro study, we have defined essential RNA sequence elements in the apoB mRNA necessary for its physiological editing and for its aberrant hyperediting. We found that for normal physiological editing, an apoB RNA fragment of 139 nt consisting of the upstream 5′ efficiency element (6609–6628), an upstream 5′ A-rich element (6629–6640), the proximal efficiency sequence defined by Driscoll et al. (6648–6661) (11Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L.M. Martinez D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7288-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the mooring sequence (6671–6681) (10Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6007-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L.M. Martinez D. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the 3′ efficiency element (6717–6747) were sufficient for editing with an efficiency equal to that of full-length apoB mRNA. We also found evidence that sequences even further downstream (6747–6824) contributed to editing at C6666(Fig. 10). The importance of the 5′ efficiency element for physiological editing was demonstrated by using short apoB RNA constructs in which the 5′ efficiency element was present or absent (Fig. 2) and by testing chimeric apoB/N-myc RNAs (Fig. 3). In these chimeric RNAs, the presence of the apoB 5′ efficiency element with the apoB editing cassette (6662–6687) was sufficient to give wild-type levels of editing at C6666. How the two elements increased editing of C6666 to wild-type levels is unknown. One possibility is the formation of Watson-Crick base pairing between the two elements. However, according to RNA folding data obtained with the Mfold program (29Zuker M. Science. 1989; 244: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1723) Google Scholar, 30Zuker M. Jacobson A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2791-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), no secondary structures are favored between the 5′ efficiency element and the editing cassette (data not shown). Our data also indicate that a second apoB RNA element supported physiological editing of C6666. This A-rich element is located at position 6629–6640, directly downstream of the 5′ efficiency element. Deletion and mutagenesis studies in this A-rich element influenced editing at C6666 severalfold (data not shown). Furthermore, a third proximal efficiency sequence at positions 6648–6661 was reported to promote editing in combination with the mooring sequence (11Driscoll D.M. Lakhe-Reddy S. Oleksa L.M. Martinez D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7288-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Independent of other sequences, the 3′ efficiency element of the apoB mRNA increased editing at C6666. A previous study indicated that 3′-flanking sequences of the apoB mRNA increase editing at C6666 (14Backus J.W. Smith H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1217: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but no efficiency element was defined. Our results indicate that the 3′ efficiency element located within a 31-nt fragment (6717–6747) was necessary for efficient physiological editing in the apoB RNA (Fig. 1). It also increased editing in combination with the apoB editing cassette (Fig. 3), although to a lesser extent than did the 5′ efficiency element. Furthermore, in the presence of the 5′ efficiency element, the 3′ efficiency element did not further increase editing (Fig. 3), indicating that the 5′ efficiency element had a stronger impact on editing of C6666 in small apoB RNA at least in vitro. Physiological editing at C6666 may also be enhanced by elements more than 81 nt from the editing site. Although these sequences were not required for efficient editing, the apoB RNA region encompassing C6802 may function as a recognition element for the editing complex (Figs. 4 and 10). According to our two-step model for apoB mRNA editing, such recognition could bring the editing complex into closer proximity to the editing site at C6666 (22Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In a second step, the enzyme complex may then bind with a much higher affinity to the editing site at C6666 than to the sequence elements that compose the binding site for the C6802 (Fig. 5). When APOBEC-1 is overexpressed, multiple cytidines are hyperedited (21Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Driscoll D.M. Innerarity T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11506-11510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Yamanaka S. Poksay K.S. Arnold K.S. Innerarity T.L.

Detailed examination of the editing of one of these cytidines, C6802, in small apoB RNAs showed that sequences similar to those important in physiological apoB mRNA editing are also involved in the hyperediting of C6802. Hyperediting at C6802 was supported by three RNA regions in the apoB mRNA: a proximal 5′-flanking region (6747–6759), a mooring-like motif (6809–6819), and a 3′-flanking region (6853–6882) (Fig. 10). The 5′-flanking region has a greater influence than the 3′-flanking region on the hyperediting of C6802. A proximal 5′-flanking region (6747–6759) and 5′ sequences upstream from that element plus the mooring-like motif were all that was necessary for high level (11.8%) hyperediting of C6802 (Fig. 5). Like the 5′ A-rich element that enhanced physiological apoB mRNA editing, the proximal 5′-flanking region (6747–6759) that enhanced the hyperediting of C6802 is AU-rich (Fig. 6). Three A → G substitutions in this element abolished hyperediting (Fig. 6). The importance of the 3′-flanking region for the hyperediting of C6802 was demonstrated in the experiment shown in Fig. 9. An apoB RNA substrate lacking the proximal 5′-flanking region was not hyperedited at C6802 until the 3′-flanking region (6853–6882) was added. Intriguingly, the minimal size of flanking regions required for hyperediting at C6802 was comparable to that required for efficient physiological editing at C6666. Hyperediting and physiological editing required 55–57 nt of upstream flanking sequences and approximately 80 nt of downstream flanking sequences (Fig. 10). The similar size of the required flanking sequences and the importance of the mooring-like motif for hyperediting at C6802 (Fig. 8) suggest that hyperediting depends on loose recognition of RNA features that define the physiological editing site at C6666. Besides the flanking sequences, a mooring-like motif supports hyperediting at C6802. Several mutagenesis studies demonstrated that physiological apoB mRNA editing depends on the highly conserved mooring sequence and the spacer region (10Backus J.W. Smith H.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 16301-16304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and alterations in the 4-nt spacer decreased editing severalfold (10Backus J.W. Smith H.C.

Chem. 1990; 265: 6811-6816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mooring-like motif downstream of C6802 has only 6 of the 11 nt in the mooring sequence and has a spacer region of 6 rather than 4 nt. Furthermore, it consists of seven Us and four As and lacks the TGAT motif previously suggested to support hyperediting (23Sowden M. Hamm J.K. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3011-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this mooring-like motif supported hyperediting of C6802, and scrambling the mooring-like pattern abolished hyperediting of C6802 in short apoB RNAs and reduced hyperediting in longer apoB RNAs (Figs. 7 and 8). Furthermore, the introduction of an exact mooring motif (B6747M) increased hyperediting at this site 2-fold (Fig. 8). These results emphasize that the mooring-like pattern is essential for hyperediting at C6802 and that not every AU-rich sequence supports hyperediting at C6802, although APOBEC-1 has been shown to bind to AU-rich RNA (31Anant S.

Scott J. Cell. 1995; 81: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The mooring-like motif at C6802 supports hyperediting of Cs located up to 27 nt upstream. When the mooring-like motif downstream of C6802 was mutated, hyperediting of C6802 was diminished or abolished (Figs. 7 and 8). Furthermore, both mutations abolished hyperediting at C6782/3 (Fig. 7), indicating that hyperediting of C6782/3 depends also on the mooring-like motif located 26–27 nt farther downstream. Hence, hyperediting has a relaxed spacer constraint compared with physiological editing, which was abolished by increasing the spacer to 12 nt (10Backus J.W. Smith H.C.

Our in vitro study shows that the essential elements for physiological editing at C6666 of the apoB mRNA encompass 139 nt, consisting of defined upstream efficiency elements, the mooring sequence, and the 3′ efficiency element. Further investigations on the secondary structure of the apoB mRNA editing locus are needed to define the interaction of these elements. Our study also shows that similar RNA features are necessary for the hyperediting of cytidines when APOBEC-1 is overexpressed.

Phe68(E11) is rotated ∼90° about χ2 and located ∼1–2 Å closer to the iron atom in the myoglobin triple mutant relative to its conformation in Lucina HbI.

Examination of the more than 300 known sequences of vertebrate Hbs and Mbs and the >130 nonvertebrate globin-like sequences demonstrates that only two residues appear to be conserved, the proximal His at helical position F-8 and the Phe parallel to the heme surface at an interhelical loop, position CD1 (1Lesk A.M.

The residue considered to be pivotal in the stabilization of the bound O2 is the one whose side chain can provide a neutral donor for a hydrogen bond with the ligand, such as His or Gln at the distal position E-7. Among vertebrate Mbs and Hbs, His predominates, with Gln occurring only in elephant Mb (4Romero-Herrera A.E. Goodman M. Dene H. Bartiniki D.E. Mizukami H. J. Mol.

Parallel functional and structural studies on genetically engineered mutants of mammalian Mb have shown that changes in only a very limited number of residues in the distal pocket often transfers the essence of the unusual behavior of the natural genetic variant to the appropriate reference protein mutant (13Travaglini Allocatelli C.

Its abundant cytoplasmic hemoglobins consist of three single-chain components, each having a moderately high affinity for oxygen (P50 = 0.1–0.2 torr), which is achieved, however, by a very different balance of combination and dissociation rates. Reactions of the monomeric HbI with oxygen are rapid, whereas those of HbII and HbIII are extraordinarily slow (23Kraus D.W. Wittenberg J.B. J. Biol.

However, the E-11 position is uniquely occupied by Phe rather than the aliphatic amino acids Val, Ile, or Leu. To examine the structural origin of strong sulfide binding in Lucina HbI, we have systematically replaced His64(E7), Leu29(B10), and Val64(E11) with Gln, Phe, and Phe, respectively, in sperm whale myoglobin and then determined the structures of the resulting multiple mutants by NMR and x-ray crystallography. This approach is similar to that used to study the unusual functional properties of Aplysia Mb,Ascaris Hb, and elephant Mb, and provides comparison between the native protein and the synthetic mimic in two ligation/spin states and between protein structures in crystal and solution (13Travaglini Allocatelli C.

The strongly relaxed signals were optimally detected in water-eliminated Fourier transform spectra (42Gupta R.K. J. Magn. Res. 1976; 24: 461-465Google Scholar). Nonselective T1s for the resolved strongly relaxed protons were measured via inversion-recovery experiment. Steady state NOEs were recorded as described previously (43Emerson S.D. La Mar G.N.

Lucina HbI shows a 5,000-fold higher affinity for sulfide than recombinant wild-type sperm whale myoglobin, whereas the two proteins have similar affinities for oxygen. There are progressive increases in KH2S as the active site of the whale myoglobin is altered to resemble that of the mollusc hemoglobin. All three single mutations, L29F, H64Q, and V68F produce large, 6–20-fold increases in sulfide affinity, and the effects on KH2S are roughly additive in the double and triple mutants. In contrast, these mutations produce markedly different effects on O2 affinity. For example, the single H64Q and L29F mutations produces a 5-fold decrease and 15-fold increase, respectively, in O2 affinity. As a result, KO2 for the triple mutant is only 3–4-fold higher than wild-type myoglobin and very similar to that ofLucina HbI (Table I).Table IEquilibrium dissociation constants for O2 and H2 S binding to Lucina HbI and mutants of recombinant sperm whale myoglobinProteinO2 binding to Fe(II)1-aReferences for O2 equilibrium constants at pH 7.0, 20 °C: Lucina HbI (23); wild-type, L29F, H64Q, and V68F Mb (28); L29F/H64Q Mb (17); L29F/V68F and L29F/H64Q/V68F Mb.2KO2H2S binding to Fe(III)1-bReferences for H2S equilibrium constants at pH 7.5, 20 °C: Lucina HbI (23); wild-type and mutant myoglobins.2KH2SKH2S/KO2μM−1Lucina HbI2.5290116(Phe29(B10), Gln64(E7), Phe68(E11))Wild-type sperm whale Mb1.10.050.045(Leu29(B10), His64(E7), Val68(E11))L29F-Mb150.320.021H64Q-Mb0.181.26.67V68F-Mb0.480.330.69L29F/H64Q-Mb0.463.78.04L29F/V68F-Mb745.30.072L29F/H64Q/V68F-Mb3.8379.741-a References for O2 equilibrium constants at pH 7.0, 20 °C: Lucina HbI (23Kraus D.W.

These include the fast block of polyspermy inXenopus oocytes that follows the sperm binding to the egg or blastocoel expansion in mammalian embryo. We have now identified a gene called dGNaC1 that is specifically expressed in the gonads and early embryo in Drosophila melanogaster. The corresponding protein belongs to the superfamily of cationic channels blocked by amiloride that includesCaenorhabditis elegans degenerins, the Helix aspersa FMRF-amide ionotropic receptor (FaNaC), the mammalian epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), and acid-sensing ionic channels (ASIC, DRASIC, and MDEG). Expression of dGNaC1 inXenopus oocytes generates a constitutive current that does not discriminate between Na+ and Li+, but is selective for Na+ over K+. This current is blocked by amiloride (IC50 = 24 μm), benzamil (IC50 = 2 μm), and ethylisopropyl amiloride (IC50 = 49 μm). These properties are clearly different from those obtained after expression of the previously cloned members of this family, including ENaC and the human αENaC-like subunit, δNaC. Interestingly, the pharmacology of dGNaC1 is not very different from that found for the Na+ channel characterized in rabbit preimplantation embryos. We postulate that this channel may participate in gametogenesis and early embryonic development inDrosophila.

Ser. 1985; 39: 211-235PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride interacts not only with ubiquitous Na+/H+antiporters, which are also expressed in gonads and are involved in initiation of development at fertilization (8Epel D. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 29: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but also with amiloride-blockable channels that are involved in the fast block of polyspermy (9Kupitz Y. Atlas D. Science. 1993; 261: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and blastocoel expansion (10Robinson D.H. Bubien J.K. Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In Xenopusoocytes, ATP triggers an amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel immediately after the sperm has bound to the egg. This depolarizes the egg membrane potential and participates in the fast block of polyspermy (9Kupitz Y. Atlas D. Science. 1993; 261: 484-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mammalian embryo, amiloride-sensitive sodium channels are also involved in the blastocoel expansion (11Biggers J.D. Bell J.E. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C419-C432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During early phases of animal embryonic development, blastomeres progressively occupy the periphery of the embryo, and a fluid-filled central cavity,i.e. the blastocoel, is formed. Fluid accumulation in the blastocoel is due to an electrogenic transport of sodium, followed by osmotically driven water, and this event can be partly inhibited by amiloride (10Robinson D.H. Bubien J.K. Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Manejwala F.M. Cragoe E.J. Schultz R.M. Dev.

Electrophysiological analyses have demonstrated that amiloride-sensitive channels are expressed in rabbit blastomeres, but their biophysical and pharmacological properties differ from those of the classical highly Na+-selective and highly amiloride-inhibitable channel (10Robinson D.H. Bubien J.K. Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Amiloride sensitivity is a common characteristic of structurally related cationic channels that are associated with a wide range of distinct physiological functions (14Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, neuronal and muscular degenerins, such as MEC-4, MEC-10, UNC-8, and UNC-105, encode amiloride-sensitive channels that are involved in mechanoperception (15Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 16Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Liu J. Schrank B.

In the snail nervous system, FaNaC is an ionotropic receptor for the mollusc cardioexcitatory peptide FMRF-amide. It forms a homotetrameric sodium-selective channel that may be involved in neuromodulation (22Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P.

Hofman P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G571-G585PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a very low identity between the most distantly related proteins of the family (∼15%), some important residues, such as those located in pre-M1, pre-M2, and M2 regions (where M1 and M2 represent the two transmembrane hydrophobic α-helices), are conserved.

This raises the possibility that members of the degenerin/ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC gene superfamily might be involved in the differentiation of gametes and/or development of eggs after fertilization. In this study, we have characterized a new member of the family inD. melanogaster, which is specifically expressed in testis, ovary, and early embryo. Its expression in Xenopus oocytes was sufficient to generate a constitutive amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel, with properties that differ from those obtained after expression of αβγENaC or δNaC/βγENaC. Since this Drosophila Na+-selective channel is specifically expressed in the gonads and early embryo, we postulate that it may correspond to a channel involved in spermatogenesis, oogenesis, and/or early embryonic development. Two sequences from the Drosophila expressed sequence tag data base (accession numbers AA264333 and AA264288) were used to design a sense and an antisense primer carrying an EcoRI (sense primer) and anXhoI (antisense primer) restriction site, respectively, at their 5′-ends. The corresponding sequences are as follows: 5′-ACGAATTCAAGAACGGAATAGACACCATG-3′ and 5′-TCCTCGAGTTGTCCGCACTTACGAAATAG-3′. These primers were used to amplify a 1750-base pair fragment by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase(s). with the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) from DrosophilacDNAs prepared from mid-stage embryos. After methylation of the internal EcoRI restriction site with EcoRI methylase (Biolabs), ligation of EcoRI linkers (Biolabs), and digestion by EcoRI and XhoI, the fragment was subcloned in the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the pBSK-SP6-globin vector (30Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Three independent clones were sequenced on both strands. They display an open reading frame of 1686 nucleotides that is not preceded by stop codon. All fly stocks (Oregon R or w1118) were maintained under standard culture conditions. For in situhybridization to polytene salivary gland chromosomes, the pBSK-SP6-globin vector containing the entire cDNA sequence of dGNaC1 was labeled with biotin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim) by random priming according to the manufacturer's instructions. For expression in Xenopus oocytes, cRNA was synthesized from the NotI-digested vector using a kit from Stratagene. Xenopus oocytes were injected with 0.5–5 ng of cRNA, and microelectrode voltage-clamp assays were performed 1–5 days after injection. Total RNA was obtained from staged embryos, larvae, pupae, and adults by the acidic phenol method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of total RNA from each developmental stage were fractionated by electrophoresis on a formaldehyde-containing 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to Nylon membrane (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The entire coding sequence of dGNaC1 was radiolabeled by the random priming method (Promega) and used as a probe (106 cpm/ml) for overnight hybridization at 42 °C in a solution containing 30% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. After washing in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, the blot was exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film for 14 days at −70 °C with intensifying screens. The filter was subsequently hybridized with a probe encoding the Drosophila rpl17 gene (32Noselli S. Vincent A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 118: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to estimate the relative amount of RNA loaded in each lane. For RT-PCR experiments, total RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. For first strand cDNA synthesis, 2 μg of total RNA were oligo(dT)-primed in a final volume of 20 μl in the presence or absence of 200 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The reaction was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h and heated at 70 °C for 15 min. For the PCR analysis, 2 μl of RT products were used with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 200 ng of the sense primer (the same as described previously for dGNaC1 cloning) and the antisense primer (5′-TCCTCGAGTGAACTGGCTGTAAAGATCAG-3′) in a 20-μl reaction mixture. Forty cycles of PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min) were performed, except for the rpl17-specific primers, for which only 20 cycles were performed. PCR products were gel electrophoresed and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Whole-mount in situhybridization of embryos and egg chambers was carried out according to Tautz and Pfeifle (33Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes corresponding to the whole coding sequence were synthesized according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Riboprobe, Gemini II-Core system). Ovaries and testes were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline and transferred directly to the fix solution consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, tissues were treated with proteinase K (50 μg/ml for 5 min). RNA probes were hybridized overnight at 55 °C in 25% formamide, 2× SSC, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 50 μg/ml heparin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Tissues were mounted in 80% glycerol and viewed with a microscope under Nomarski optics. Two partial cDNA sequences from Drosophila embryo similar to those of other members of the degenerin/ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC superfamily were found in the data base of expressed sequence tags (accession numbers AA264333 andAA264288). One displayed similarity in the 5′-coding region (AA264333), including the first transmembrane domain, and contained a putative start codon. The other (AA264288) showed similarity in the 3′-coding region, including the second transmembrane domain, and contained a putative stop codon. Two oligonucleotides flanking the putative coding sequence were used to amplify by PCR a fragment of 1750 base pairs fromDrosophila cDNA. It contains an open reading frame of 1686 base pairs and codes for a protein of 562 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). This protein has all the hallmarks of the degenerin/ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC superfamily, i.e.two hydrophobic domains flanking a large region including a cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 1, A and B) that was shown to be extracellular for the epithelial Na+ channel (34Renard S. Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12981-12986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for the degenerin MEC-4 (35Lai C. Hong K. Kinnell M. Chalfie M. Driscoll M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). dGNaC1 was mapped byin situ hybridization to region 82CD on the right arm of the third chromosome (data not shown). WhendGNaC1 cRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes, an amiloride-sensitive Na+-selective current was recorded (Fig. 2 A). Large variations in the amplitude of the amiloride-sensitive current were found in different oocyte batches (from a few tens of nA up to ∼1 μA). Treatment with ATP, a jump in the external pH, and activation of protein kinases A and C were not able to alter the current (data not shown). The ionic substitutions experiments (Fig. 2 C) and the inversion of the amiloride-sensitive current at positive potential values (Er = 36.5 ± 6.6 mV, n= 11) (Fig. 2 D) suggested a higher permeability of the channel for Na+ over K+ and an equal permeability for Li+ and Na+. Amiloride and its derivative, ethylisopropyl amiloride, blocked the channel, with half-inhibition concentrations (IC50) of 24 and 49 μm, respectively, whereas benzamil was found to be more effective, with an IC50 of 2 μm (Fig. 2 B). The expression pattern of dGNaC1 was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization of total RNA isolated from different developmental stages (Fig. 3 A). Three observations were made. First, two forms of mRNA are transcribed: one major RNA transcript of 3.2 kb and a second transcript of 2.3 kb, probably explained by different mRNA polyadenylation, alternative splicing of the dGNaC1 gene, or the presence of a closely related homologous mRNA. Second, the expression level is strongly regulated during development (Fig. 3 A). The mRNA was readily detected in early embryos (0–4 h), suggesting a high level of maternal expression. However, no further expression was detected during late embryogenesis. Third, dGNaC1 is specifically transcribed in the gonads (Fig. 3, A and B). The highest RNA level was detected in ovaries; RNA was still detectable in whole females, but not in females lacking ovaries or in males (Fig. 3 A). More sensitive measurements made using RT-PCR detected dGNaC1 transcripts in whole males due to specific expression in the genital tract (Fig. 3 B). No signal was observed in males after removal of their genital tracts or in females after removal of their ovaries (Fig. 3 B). A more precise determination of dGNaC1 transcript localization was assessed by in situ hybridization. Experiments with digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes and control experiments with sense probes were performed on wild-type ovaries and testes (Fig. 4). dGNaC1 RNA was not detectable in ovarian stem cells, oogonia, and early cysts (Fig. 4 A). They were weakly detected at stage 5 (according to the criteria of King (36King R.C. Ovarian Development in Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, New York1970Google Scholar)), and the highest expression was seen at stage 10, where they were present throughout the nurse cells, oocytes, and follicle cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In situ hybridization was also performed on whole-mount embryos. The criteria of Campos-Ortega and Hartenstein (37Campos-Ortega J.A. Hartenstein V. The Embryonic Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1985Crossref Google Scholar) were used to identify stages of embryonic development. At the syncytial stage (stage 4), prior to cellularization, dGNaC1 was distributed uniformly within the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 C). It was also detected in the cellular blastoderm embryo (Fig. 4 D). The pole cells, the progenitors of the germ line, did not accumulate dGNaC1transcripts (Fig. 4 D). Levels of transcript then declined in embryos at stage 8, i.e. at early gastrulation (Fig. 4 E), and subsequently vanished. In situ hybridization on the male genital tract also revealed the presence of transcript. dGNaC1 was not detected in the apical tips, which contain the stem cells and gonial cysts, but it was detected in the cysts that contain primary spermatocytes or cells entering meiosis (Fig. 4 G). dGNaC1 was also detected in seminal vesicles (Fig. 4 G). This work reports the identification of a gene related to the degenerin/ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC superfamily of ion channels in D. melanogaster. This finding is consistent with the view that amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels are widely expressed throughout the whole animal kingdom. Physiological studies have previously shown that a channel related to the epithelial sodium channel is present in the leech Hirudo medicinalis, where it controls animal volume (38Weber W.M. Dannenmaier B. Clauss W. J. Comp. Physiol. B Biochem. Syst. Environ. Physiol. 1993; 163: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and in Lumbricus terrestrisintestine, where amiloride-sensitive sodium transport displays seasonal changes via an unknown hormonal regulatory mechanism (39Cornell J.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Comp. Physiol. 1984; 78: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C. elegans degenerins are widely expressed in nematode neurons and muscle (40Garcı́a-Añoveros J. Corey D.P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 567-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and Helix or Aplysianeurons express the FMRF-amide ionotropic receptor (22Lingueglia E. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. Nature. 1995; 378: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The Drosophila gene encodes dGNaC1, a protein of 562 amino acids that contains all the conserved motifs characteristic of the family. This protein has significant but low sequence identity to the other members of the family (below 20%) (Fig. 1 C) and cannot be linked to any of them by phylogenetic analyses (data not shown), except for another protein identified in Drosophilaperipheral nervous system that displays 38% identity to dGNaC1 (41Darboux I. Lingueglia E. Pauron D. Barbry P. Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar,53Adams C.M. Anderson M.G. Motto D.G. Price M.P. Johnson W.A. Welsh M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Similarity was stronger around the first and second transmembrane domains, but was low in the large extracellular loop, except for the cysteine-rich region and the two highly conserved motifs107FPAVTVC113 and224GICYTFN230 (Fig. 1 A). Despite distant phylogenetic relationships, the overall structure of dGNaC1 makes it closer to αENaC, βENaC, γENaC, or δNaC than to the other members of the family (Fig. 1 B). According to the classification proposed by Barbry and Hofman (28Barbry P. Hofman P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G571-G585PubMed Google Scholar), dGNaC1 would therefore group with the proteins involved in vectorial transport, in agreement with the functional properties of the dGNaC1 channel recorded in Xenopus oocytes (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the intracellular COOH-terminal part of dGNaC1, which was shown to have an important role in epithelial sodium channel regulation (42Hansson J.H. Nelson-Williams C. Suzuki H. Schild L. Shimkets R.A. Lu Y. Canessa C.M. Iwasaki T. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 43Jeunemaitre X. Bassilana F. Persu A. Dumont C.

Cell. 1994; 79: 407-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1193) Google Scholar), is extremely short. The channel expressed in Xenopus oocytes after injection of the in vitro transcribed RNA is highly selective for Na+ over K+ and is blocked by amiloride. While ENaC is more permeant to Li+ than to Na+, dGNaC1 does not discriminate between Na+ and Li+ and displays a small but significant K+permeability. Amiloride concentrations needed to block this channel are 10–100 times higher than those necessary to block ENaC or δNaC (20Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar,29Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Ethylisopropyl amiloride, a classical high affinity blocker of the Na+/H+ antiporter, can also efficiently block the dGNaC1 channel, with a potency similar to that of amiloride. Ethylisopropyl amiloride is much less active than amiloride in blocking the ENaC channel (20Lingueglia E. Voilley N. Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Barbry P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The dGNaC1 single-channel conductance was difficult to assess due to a noisy current with no resolved unitary current levels (data not shown). The pharmacological and biophysical properties of dGNaC1 are very close to those of an αβγENaC channel comprising a mutated α-subunit in which Ser589 in the second transmembrane domain was changed to a phenylalanine (30Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar),i.e. the residue found in the equivalent position of dGNaC1. Successful heterologous expression of dGNaC1 was obtained only inXenopus oocytes. It was actually not possible to record any dGNaC1 activity in transfected mammalian COS cells (data not shown). This strongly suggests that dGNaC1 channel activity is modulated by aXenopus oocyte-specific factor. This is particularly noteworthy since expression of dGNaC1 transcripts inDrosophila was also restricted to oocytes of late vitellogenic stages and to early embryos, in addition to nurse cells and follicular cells. Transcripts disappeared completely at the stage of late gastrulation. Thus, dGNaC1 corresponds to a maternally encoded gene. The functional properties of dGNaC1 described here can presently be related to two distinct physiological processes. First, between stages 10 and 14, the oocyte develops in an egg chamber comprising a cyst of 15 nurse cells interconnected by ring canals at the anterior edge. The single oocyte is surrounded with an epithelium layer of follicle cells (for review, see Ref. 45Spradling A.C. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1-70Google Scholar). Active transcription and translation by nurse cells produce the different constituents that are necessary for efficient growth of the oocyte. They are coupled to transport from nurse cells to the oocyte through intercellular junctions. Voltage gradients between nurse cells and the oocyte were first reported and proposed to explain this transport by Woodruff and Telfer (46Woodruff R.I. Telfer W.H. Nature. 1980; 286: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, available evidence does not support a role for electrophoresis in the early phases of transport (47Bohrmann J. Gutzeit H. Development (Camb.). 1987; 101: 279-288PubMed Google Scholar). Using a vibrating probe, Overall and Jaffé (48Overall R. Jaffé L.F. Dev. Biol. 1985; 108: 102-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have described a large steady Na+influx through the anterior or nurse cell end of the follicles. Coupled with efflux at the posterior side of the egg, this transcellular transport is expected to be coupled to osmotic transport of water. The drag effect that can accompany this active Na+ transport would in that case carry macromolecules. dGNaC1 transcripts were found in nurse cells and follicular cells. This raises the possibility that dGNaC1 is involved in the entry of sodium into nurse cells. A second potential role for dGNaC1 could be in the hydration event that is associated with ovulation in Drosophila (49Mahowald A.P. Goralski T.J. Caulton J.H. Dev. Biol. 1983; 98: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and more generally in the large swelling of the oocytes that is observed during final maturation. Interestingly, LaFleur and Thomas (3LaFleur Jr., G.J. Thomas P. J. Exp. Zool. 1991; 258: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have reported that in marine teleosts, such oocyte swelling is partially blocked by amiloride (3LaFleur Jr., G.J. Thomas P. J. Exp. Zool. 1991; 258: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A similar dGNaC1 function related to volume increase could take place in testis, where dGNaC1 transcripts are detected in the primary spermatocyte stage of development and in later cells in the spermiogenic pathway. The primary spermatocyte transcribes most if not all of the gene products needed for the dramatic morphogenetic events that follow meiosis (for review, see Fuller (50Fuller M.T. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 71-147Google Scholar)). The primary spermatocyte stage lasts 90 h. During this time, the cells grow 25 times in volume (51Tates A.D. Cytodifferentiation during Spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster: an Electron Microscope Study. J. H. Rasmans, The Hague, The Netherlands1971Google Scholar). Such volume increase may be related to electrogenic sodium transport through dGNaC1, osmotically followed by water. Nevertheless, since there exist mechanisms that act during spermatogenesis to delay translation of certain messages until well after transcription, a function later in spermiogenesis cannot be excluded. Amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels have been implicated in vertebrate development. In mammalian embryo, the blastocoel is formed by fluid accumulation due to an electrogenic transport of sodium partly inhibited by amiloride (10Robinson D.H. Bubien J.K. Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Manejwala F.M. Cragoe E.J. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1989; 133: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Powers R.D. Borland R.M. Biggers J.D. Nature. 1977; 270: 603-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, a stage 5 embryo, which corresponds to mammalian blastula, is indeed a syncytium lacking a fluid-filled central cavity (for review, see Foeet al. (52Foe V.E. Odell G.M. Edgar B.A. Bate M. Martinez-Arias A. The Development of Drosophila melanogaster. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 149-300Google Scholar)). Thus, dGNaC1 can hardly be linked to blastocoelic expansion. Nevertheless, the Na+ channel characterized in 7-day postcoitus preimplantation embryos in rabbits is inhibited by amiloride, benzamil, and ethylisopropyl amiloride, with apparent dissociation constants of 12, 50, and 16 μm, respectively (10Robinson D.H. Bubien J.K. Smith P.R. Benos D.J. Dev. Biol. 1991; 147: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These values are not very different from those found for dGNaC1, but they are clearly distinct from those found for the classical epithelial Na+ channel (28Barbry P. Hofman P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G571-G585PubMed Google Scholar) or for the human sodium channel δ-subunit (29Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Voilley N. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27411-27414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). One can thus infer from the gonad-specific expression of dGNaC1 in Drosophila that new members of the degenerin/ENaC/FaNaC/ASIC gene superfamily similar to dGNaC1 will be identified in vertebrate gonads, where they will be involved in early developmental processes. In conclusion, we report here the properties of dGNaC1, a new gonad-specific Drosophila amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel that may participate in gametogenesis and early embryonic development. Elucidation of the regulatory properties of this channel will probably reveal important mechanisms controlling early steps of development. We are very grateful to Drs.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed at residues suggested to be important in the catalytic mechanism based on the crystal structure of the human enzyme and other biochemical studies. In vitroautoproteolysis allowed the mutant enzymes to be activated, including those that were slow to self-cleave. Based on the activity of the mutant enzymes, six catalytically essential amino acids were identified: Trp-11, Asp-66, Thr-152, Thr-170, Arg-180, and Asp-183. Kinetic analysis of each mutant further defined the function of these residues in substrate specificity and reaction rate. Mutagenesis of the N-terminal nucleophile residue Thr-152 confirmed the key function of its side-chain hydroxyl group. Partial activities of mutants T152S/C were in agreement with the general mechanism of N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn)-amidohydrolases. The side-chain hydroxyl of Thr-170 contributes to the reaction rate based on studies of mutants T170S/C/A. Residues Asp-183 and Arg-180 were found to H-bond, respectively, with the charged α-amino and α-carboxyl group of the substrate (Asn-GlcNAc). Mutants R180Q/L and D183E/N had greatly decreased substrate affinity and reduced reaction rates. Kinetic studies also showed that Trp-11 is involved in regulation of the enzyme reaction rate, contradictory to a previous suggestion that this residue is involved in substrate binding. Asp-66 is a new residue found to be important in enzyme activity.

Glycosylasparaginase (glycoasparaginase,N 4-(β-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl)-l-asparagine amidohydrolase) is a widely distributed amidohydrolase involved in the ordered degradation of N-linked glycoproteins. It cleaves the Asn-GlcNAc linkage that joins the oligosaccharide to the protein (1Aronson Jr., N.N. Kuranda M.J. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2615-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Mononen I.

Previous studies have shown the enzyme has a strict substrate specificity that requires both a free α-amino and α-carboxyl group on the asparagine residue. In contrast, relatively flexible substrate requirements exist at the sugar portion of the substrate. Substrates having mono-, di-, or even longer saccharides are effectively hydrolyzed although the presence of α-l-fucose on the 6-hydroxyl of the N-acetylglucosamine prevents the enzyme reaction (5Kaartinen V.

A recent report suggests that the α-amino and α-carboxyl group of the aspartate component of the substrate may not be strictly required for enzyme activity (8Risley J.M. Xia Y. FASEB J. 1996; 10 (abstr.): 1104Google Scholar). Glycosylasparaginases have been purified or cloned from seven biological sources, and all of them are encoded by a single gene (9Liu Y.

After translation, the nascent single polypeptide is cleaved into two nonidentical α and β subunits by an autoproteolytic procedure (12Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C-L. Combs D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This self-cleavage produces the catalytically active glycosylasparaginase heterodimer (13Fisher K.J. Klein M. Park H. Vettese M. Aronson Jr., N.N.

Glycosylasparaginases from all the different species show a high sequence homology and conservation of biochemical properties (9Liu Y. Aronson Jr., N.N.

Human glycosylasparaginase is folded into four layers of secondary structure, α-helices/β-sheet/β-sheet/α-helices (16Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 12: 1102-1108Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and shares unusual structural features of a recently recognized enzyme superfamily of amidases, the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) 1The abbreviations used are: Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: GOT, glutamic/oxaloacetic transaminase; MD, malate dehydrogenase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PA, penicillin acylase; GAT, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase; GLMS, glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase; Asp(pNA)-OH, aspartic acid β-(p-nitroanilide). 1The abbreviations used are: Ntn, N-terminal nucleophile; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: GOT, glutamic/oxaloacetic transaminase; MD, malate dehydrogenase; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PA, penicillin acylase; GAT, glutamine phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase; GLMS, glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase; Asp(pNA)-OH, aspartic acid β-(p-nitroanilide). amidohydrolases (17Aronson Jr., N.N.

Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The open cleft between the two central layers of antiparallel β-sheets is the position that incorporates the active site of these enzymes (18Brannigan J.A. Dobson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E.

These enzymes are expected to manifest a common catalytic mechanism. First, a unique property of Ntn hydrolases is that the N-terminal amino acid acts as the reaction nucleophile: Oγ of SerB1 in PA; Sγ of Cys-1 of GAT and GLMS (17Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,18Brannigan J.A. Dobson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Second, the free α-amino group of these same N-terminal residues serves as a base to enhance the nucleophilicity of their side chain hydroxyl or thiol group. The x-ray structure of human glycosylasparaginase revealed not only its active-site N-terminal Thr nucleophile/base but also other amino acids likely involved in catalysis because the reaction product aspartic acid remained bound within the crystallized protein (16Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 12: 1102-1108Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In regards to the proposed catalytic groups of human glycosylasparaginase, some mutagenesis and expression experiments have already been done (24Tikkanen R. Riikonen A. Oinonen C. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2954-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, limited kinetic data were obtained from these studies. A major obstacle was the inability to obtain pure autoproteolyzed mutant human enzyme in sufficient quantity to distinguish between the reaction mechanism for substrate hydrolysis and the autoproteolysis required to activate the single-chain precursor. Thus, it has been noted that many prospective active site residues are also likely to be involved in enzyme autoproteolysis, since precursor and mature enzyme may share a similar structure and the enzymatic mechanisms used in these two processes may resemble one another (17Aronson Jr., N.N. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,18Brannigan J.A. Dobson G. Duggleby H.J. Moody P.C.E. Smith J.L. Tomchick D.R. Murzin A.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 416-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In this paper, we have applied a recombinant bacterial glycosylasparaginase system previously used by Guan (12Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C-L. Combs D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) to mutate the predicted active site amino acids as well as other residues structurally close to the catalytic core. In vitroautoproteolysis and biochemical characterization of these mutants make it possible to investigate in detail the residues that are essential for precursor polypeptide folding, autoproteolytic activation, structural stability, and enzyme catalysis. Three different substrates were used to kinetically analyze the activity of these mutant forms of the enzyme, and the effects of these particular amino acid residues on either substrate specificity or glycosylasparaginase reaction rate have been measured. Site-directed mutagenesis (Kunkel method) was carried out as described by Guan (12Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C-L. Combs D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Wild-typeFlavobacterium glycosylasparaginase coding sequence (11Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Hauer C.R. Changchien L.-M. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 316: 399-406Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was cloned into pMAL-p2 (New England Biolabs) as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) chimera. Single-stranded phagemid that harbored wild-type sequence was rescued by adding M13K07 helper phage (New England Biolabs) to liquid-cultured transformed TB1 cells and was then isolated by 20% polyethylene glycol, 2.5 m NaCl precipitation followed by phenol/chloroform extraction, twice each. This single-stranded phagemid was used as the template to conduct further mutagenesis experiments. Primers with one to three base changes were constructed to substitute single amino acids at the desired position. Vectors bearing the designed substitution were selected based on positional DNA sequencing of the mutation. Subsequent sequencing of the entire protein coding region revealed no other mutations. At least three independent clones of each mutant were picked. Proteins were expressed in the TB1 cells by adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction at 30 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mmNaCl, and lysed by sonication. Enzymes were affinity purified over an amylose column according to the protocol of the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). After purification, the chimeric glycosylasparaginases were digested with Factor Xa at 10 °C for 2–3 h. Cleaved MBP was removed by running the protease reaction through a high-Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. Protein expression efficiency using this system was about 40 mg glycosylasparaginase in a 1-liter culture. The protocol used to perform in vitro autoproteolysis was done according to Guan (12Guan C. Cui T. Rao V. Liao W. Benner J. Lin C-L. Combs D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1732-1737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All steps were done in succession immediately after affinity purification and removal of MBP. Purified mutant glycosylasparaginases were concentrated by Centricon 10 ultrafiltration (Amicon Corp.) and were immediately analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Wild-type enzyme appeared as its separated α and β subunits having molecular weights of approximately 15 and 18 kDa. Slow cleavage precursors required incubation at 37 °C for an appropriate time. Autoproteolysis of these precursors was monitored by taking aliquots at different time intervals and analyzing them on SDS-PAGE. For the slowest cleavage mutants, an intermediate level of formed glycosylasparaginase subunits was used to measure the amount of active enzyme. The cleaved forms were quantitated after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining by determining their image density using the computer program NIH Image 1.62. 2Available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/default.html. Three different substrates were used to assay the activity of wild-type and mutant glycosylasparaginases, and the kinetic parameters Km and kcat were determined for each reaction. Due to very low activities of some enzymes and solubility limitations of some substrates, not all mutant enzymes were tested with all three substrates. The standard reaction was 2.5 mm substrate in 20 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, incubated with enzyme for an appropriate time at 37 °C (25Tollersrud O.K. Aronson Jr., N.N. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 250 mm sodium borate buffer, pH 8.8, followed by boiling for 3 min. Released N-acetylglucosamine was assayed by the Morgan-Elson reaction (26Levvy G.A. McAllan A. Biochem J. 1989; 73: 127-132Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). TheKm and kcat values of mutants R180K/Q/L and D183E/N were determined by this method. Experiments were performed by incubating 12–15 different concentrations of Asn-GlcNAc from 1 to 20 mm with R180K, 1 to 50 mm with D183E, and 10 to 100 mm with all other mutants. Substrate concentrations higher than 100 mm were also tried; however, less accurate results were obtained due to the level of free GlcNAc in this amount of substrate. Initial rates of GlcNAc release were measured when less than 5% of total substrate was hydrolyzed, and these values were used to determine Km and kcat. The above traditional colorimetric method measuring GlcNAc has an assay limit at about 0.1 mm which was not sensitive enough to do a precise kinetic study of many of the mutant enzyme forms. Therefore, enzyme activity was also assayed by a coupled enzymatic procedure originally described by Tarentino and Maley (27Tarentino A.L. Maley F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1969; 130: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and based on: 1) the hydrolysis of the two substrates by glycosylasparaginase with the release of aspartate; 2) the subsequent transamination of aspartate to oxaloacetate by glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) in the presence of α-ketoglutarate; and 3) formation of NAD+ after malate dehydrogenase (MD) reduction of oxaloacetate to malate with NADH. Formation of NAD+ was then measured fluorometrically using a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer with the excitation wavelength at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm. Each reaction was performed in 150 μl of 20 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm α-ketoglutarate, 0.2 mg of NADH, 7.5 units each of GOT and MD with a glycosylasparaginase substrate and an appropriate amount of wild-type or mutant enzyme. All reagents and enzymes for the GOT and MD steps were obtained from Sigma. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by vigorously mixing with 20 μl of 6 n HCl to destroy excess NADH followed by adding 100 μl of 10 nNaOH (28Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1974: 2045-2059Crossref Google Scholar). Samples of 200 μl from each reaction were placed in a 96-well plate to measure the fluorescence of the NAD+ final product. Sensitivity of this assay allows measurement of 0.002 mm NAD+, which enabled accurate determination of enzyme hydrolysis over a wide range. To determine the Km and kcat of enzyme hydrolysis, 10–15 concentrations of substrate were used, generally ranging from 0.2 to 5 times Km. Initial rates were calculated by terminating reactions at three to five different time points. The highest substrate concentration used was 30 mmfor Asn-GlcNAc and 8 mm for asparagine. Results were not accurate at higher substrate concentrations by this method because of a high background from contaminating free aspartate. Each reaction was in a volume of 200 μl of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing appropriate concentrations of aspartic acid β-(p-nitroanilide) (Bachem) substrate and wild-type or mutant enzyme. Release of p-nitroaniline was monitored at 400 nm with a 37 °C temperature-controlled Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer (29Tarentino A.L. Plummer Jr., T.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Km and kcat were determined by measuring the initial hydrolysis rates at 12–15 concentrations of substrate ranging from 0.2 to 5 times Km. Because of the limiting solubility of Asp(pNA)-OH in water, the highest concentration of substrate used in this assay was 8 mm. The maximum reaction time used for Asp(pNA)-OH and Asn substrates was not over 1 h, and nonenzymatic hydrolysis did not occur during this period of incubation at 37 °C. Asn-GlcNAc was assayed for 3 days with the T152C and T170A mutant enzymes and was stable by itself for this long incubation. Residues of Flavobacteriumglycosylasparaginase selected for mutagenesis (Table I) were mostly the counterparts of essential human glycosylasparaginase residues (16Oinonen C. Tikkanen R. Rouvinen J. Peltonen L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 12: 1102-1108Crossref Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 30Perakyla M. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1189-1196Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of wild-type enzyme are shown in Fig. 1 a (lanes 1–5). The same protocol was used to express and purify mutant enzymes. No obvious different behavior was observed for these mutants during the procedures, and all recombinants were expressed as stable proteins. The wild-type banding pattern was observed for mutants S50A, D58N, T64A, D107N, T169A, K176A, and T203S, indicating these mutations did not interfere with polypeptide folding or their autoproteolytic activation. All other mutagenesis of the targeted amino acids resulted in incomplete or poor initial autoproteolysis with an uncleaved precursor band (αβ) present at about 32 kDa. Incubation of these mutants at 37 °C allowed most of them to be cleaved into their subunits (Fig. 1 b; Table I). In the case of the R180K mutant, the majority of its precursor precipitated during the 37 °C incubation (Fig. 1 c). The same phenomenon occurred with all other R180 mutants (data not shown). Mutants W11F and T152A did not undergo autoproteolysis (Fig. 1 b). Activity of wild-type enzyme and each mutant was assayed colorimetrically using 2.5 mmAsn-GlcNAc as substrate after the mutant precursors had completed their autoproteolysis (Table I). Almost all mutant enzymes that were “slow” to form subunits (T½ > 60 min) were poorly active once autoproteolysis took place. The T203A glycosylasparaginase (T½ = 3.5 h) was an exception and retained substantial catalytic capacity (31% of wild-type enzyme).Table ISite-directed mutagenesis of amino acids located at or nearby the enzyme active siteMutation (human counterpart)AutoproteolysisAutoproteolysisEnzyme activity%T½Wild type100WT100W11S (W11)6530 min1W11F0Not detectableNot detectableE48A (D47)8020 min120S50A (S49)955 min18D58N (D57)100WT93T64A (T63)97WT43D66N (D65)7020 min1D107N (E107)97WT78T152S (T183)6025 min8T152C0>36 h<0.1T152A0Not detectableNot detectableT169A (T200)97WT58T170S (T201)6520 min85T170C512 h<1T170A318 h<0.1K176A (K207)97WT80R180K (R211)103.5 h6R180Q820 h<1R180L8>30 h<1R180A3>30 h<0.1D183E (D214)8030 min<1D183N8040 min<1D183A5060 min<0.1T203S (T234)100WT80T203A43.5 h31Autoproteolysis was determined by SDS-PAGE of wild-type and mutant enzyme samples immediately after protein purification (Fig. 1 a).

Enzyme activity using Asn-GlcNAc as substrate was compared after >90% autoproteolysis to wild-type glycosylasparaginase. WT, wild type. Glycosylasparaginases from most organisms are known to have high thermostability (15Tollersrud O.K. Aronson Jr., N.N. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the Flavobacteriumenzyme is noticeably less heat stable than the human enzyme (32Tarentino A.L. Lysosomal Storage Disease: Aspartylglycosaminuria. R. G. Landes Company, 1997: 101-118Google Scholar). Therefore, the stability of the mutant recombinant enzymes was examined at different temperatures (Fig. 2). Wild-type enzyme began to inactivate at 55 °C and was completely inactivated at 60 °C. Mutants D107N and T169A began to inactivate about 5–10 degrees earlier than wild-type. Three other mutants, S50A, D58N, and T203A, were completely inactivated at 55 °C. D183N had an unstable structure and precipitated at 50 °C. D66N had the least stable structure and was barely active even at 40 °C. Glycosylasparaginase kinetic parametersKm and kcat were determined using the natural substrate Asn-GlcNAc or the alternate compounds, asparagine or Asp(pNA)-OH (see “Materials and Methods”). Enzyme residues that might interact with the oligosaccharide could be studied by comparing hydrolysis of asparagine and Asp(pNA)-OH to that of Asn-GlcNAc (Table II). A typical kinetic analysis of the initial rates as a function of substrate concentration is shown in Fig. 3. Wild-type enzyme had a Km for the natural substrate Asn-GlcNAc of 0.085 mm, which is similar to human glycosylasparaginase (33Kaartinen V. Williams J.C. Tomoch J. Yates III, J.R. Hood L.E. Mononen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kcat was 16 s−1. A contribution of GlcNAc to the enzyme-substrate interaction and reaction was indicated by a 7-fold increase of the Km and a 13-fold decrease of kcat when asparagine was used as substrate. The nitroaniline analogue was a somewhat better substrate than asparagine probably because the aromatic nitroaniline group is a better leaving group and might also improve substrate-enzyme binding.Table IICatalytic parameters of glycosylasparaginase mutants using different substratesAsn-GlcNAc2-aKinetic parameters for the substrate Asn-GlcNAc of wild-type (WT), T152S, T170S/C, T203S/A, D66N, and W11S enzymes were determined by measuring NADH conversion to NAD+ in a three-step coupled assay (see “Materials and Methods”).

https://openalex.org/W2038161453,"Ras proteins are guanine-nucleotide binding proteins that have a low intrinsic GTPase activity that is enhanced 105-fold by the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) p120-GAP and neurofibromin. Comparison of the primary sequences of RasGAPs shows two invariant arginine residues (Arg1276 and Arg1391 of neurofibromin). In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to change each of these residues in the catalytic domain of neurofibromin (NF1-334) to alanine. The ability of the mutant proteins to bind to Ras·GTP and to stimulate their intrinsic GTPase rate was then determined by kinetic methods under single turnover conditions using a fluorescent analogue of GTP. The separate contributions of each of these residues to catalysis and binding affinity to Ras were measured. Both the R1276A and the R1391A mutant NF1-334 proteins were 1000-fold less active than wild-type NF1-334 in activating the GTPase when measured at saturating concentrations. In contrast, there was only a minor effect of either mutation on NF1-334 affinity for wild-type Ha-Ras. These data are consistent with both arginines being required for efficient catalysis. Neither arginine is absolutely essential, because the mutant NF1-334 proteins increase the intrinsic Ras·GTPase by at least 100-fold. The roles of Arg1276 and Arg1391 in neurofibromin are consistent with proposals based on the recently published x-ray structure of p120-GAP complexed with Ras.

Members of the Ras superfamily of guanine-nucleotide binding proteins, comprising the Ras, Rho, Rab, and Arf families, share common structural and biochemical properties (1Grand R.J.A. Owen D. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 609-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 3Macara I.G.

Each protein exists in a GTP-bound conformation that is converted into the GDP-bound conformation through hydrolysis of the bound GTP. The intrinsic GTPase rate of these proteins is relatively slow, around 10−3–10−4 s−1. This intrinsic GTPase is activated by ∼105-fold by interaction with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; NF1, neurofibromin; NF1-334, catalytic domain of NF1; mant, 2′(3′)O-N-methylanthraniloyl. 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; NF1, neurofibromin; NF1-334, catalytic domain of NF1; mant, 2′(3′)O-N-methylanthraniloyl. GAPs have been characterized for members of all branches of the Ras superfamily. Since the first identification of p120-GAP as a RasGAP, several other RasGAPs have been cloned, such as neurofibromin (NF1), IRA, and GAP1. The catalytic (Ras-binding) domain of these proteins has been identified, and it contains within its most conserved region 13 invariant residues. The x-ray structures of the GTPase-activating domain of p120-GAP both alone and in complex with Ras have recently been published (4Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). It can be seen from these structures that the role of most of these conserved residues is likely to be structural. From the structural data, it was proposed that Arg789 and Arg903 (equivalent to Arg1276 and Arg1391 of NF1) (Fig. 1 a) might play an essential role in catalysis by directly contributing a residue to the GTPase active site. Although there is support for this hypothesis based on mutagenesis studies of these conserved arginines in p120-GAP and NF1, there have been conflicting data reported (6Skinner R.H. Bradley S.

We believed that confusion may have resulted because the fundamental parameters describing catalysis, the maximal rate (kcat) and the affinity (Kd), have not always been measured in these mutagenesis experiments. To verify the proposed mechanism, we considered that it was important to undertake a more detailed examination of the biochemical properties of these arginine residues. Therefore, we mutated either Arg1276 or Arg1391to alanine in the catalytic domain of NF1, i.e. NF1-334 (13Eccleston J.F. Moore K.J.M. Morgan L. Skinner R.H. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27012-27019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and measured the effects of these mutations on both catalysis and on binding affinity with wild-type and Leu61Ha-Ras. Harvey Ras (wild-type truncated at residue 166 and full-length Leu61Ha-Ras) were prepared as described previously (14Skinner R.H. Picardo M. Gane N.M. Cook N.D. Morgan L. Rowedder J. Lowe P.N. Anal.

Wild-type and mutant NF1-334 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins and cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase and purified as described previously (13Eccleston J.F. Moore K.J.M. Morgan L. Skinner R.H. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27012-27019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of NF1-334 were determined using ε280 value of 32520m−1cm−1 calculated from the extinction coefficients of Tyr and Trp residues (16Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) Ras·mant-nucleotide complexes were prepared, and their concentrations were determined, as described previously (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The R1276A and R1391A mutations in glutathione S-transferase-NF1-334 were made using the two-step PCR method described by Landt et al. (18Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). In the first PCR, oligonucleotides BS1 (5′-dCTGTTGCCTGCGAAGAGAGTC-3′ for the R1276A mutation) and BS2 (5′-dGTTCCTCGCATTTATCAATCC-3′ for the R1391A mutation), were used in combination with a “flanking” oligonucleotide located either 5′ to the unique XhoI site for R1276A (RS113: 5′-dTTTGACAGATCTACGCTAGCAGAAACAGTATTGGCT-3′, where the last 24 nucleotides correspond to amino acids 1195–1202 of NF1) or 3′ to the unique NdeI site for R1391A (RS131: 5′-dCGTGCTGCATCAAAGTT-3′, which is complementary to the DNA sequence corresponding to amino acids 1450–1455) to amplify 265- and 200-base pair DNA fragments, respectively. These DNA fragments were gel purified and used in a second PCR with the other flanking oligonucleotide (RS114 (5′-dTTTGTGGTCGACTTAGAACTCCTCTGGGGGCCCTAGGTATGCAAG-3′) for R1276A and RS113 for R1391A). The PCR products of the second reaction were isolated as a XhoI/NdeI DNA fragment that was ligated into pGEX-NF1-334 DNA digested with XhoI and NdeI. The presence of each mutation was determined by DNA sequencing, and the entire DNA between XhoI and NdeI restriction sites was sequenced to confirm that no other mutations had occurred. All measurements were made in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at 30 °C unless otherwise stated. Time courses of fluorescence changes over periods of less than 10 s were made in a Hi-Tech MX61 stopped-flow fluorometer operated in the single push mode. Excitation was at 366 nm, and emitted light was monitored through a Wratten 47B filter. For monitoring fluorescence changes over longer time periods, measurements were made on a SLM 8000S fluorometer with excitation at 366 nm, and emission was monitored at 440 nm. High performance liquid chromatography of mant nucleotides was as described previously (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Data on the effect of concentration of NF1 on the observed rate constant (kobs) for the fast phase of the fluorescence change consequent to mixing Ras·mantGTP and NF1-334 was fitted to Equation 1. This describes the kinetics of initial formation of Ras·mantGTP·NF1-334 complex (Scheme 1, below). The assumption is made that the fluorescence changes reflect formation of the Ras·mantGTP·NF1-334 complex.kobs=k1[NF1­334]+k−1Equation 1 Data on the effect of concentration of NF1 on the observed rate constant (kobs) for the slow phase of the fluorescence change consequent to mixing Ras·mantGTP and NF1 was fitted to Equation 2 using non-linear regression.kobs=kmaxP−P2−4[Ras]0[NF1­334]02[Ras]0Equation 2 where P = [Ras]0 + [NF1-334]0 + K1, [Ras]0 = total concentration of Ras, [NF1-334]0 = total concentration of NF1-334, and kmax is the limiting value of the slow phase. This equation describes the process shown in Scheme 1 below, in which the initial binding step is a rapid equilibrium. This assumption is valid for the mutant proteins, in which k1 and k−1 are very fast compared withk2. It is not valid in the case of wild-type NF1-334, where k−1 <k2. However, kinetic simulation experiments show that this treatment gives K1 within a factor of 2 of the true value. The assumption is also made that the fluorescence decrease reflects formation of Ras·mantGDP·Pi·NF1-334. Wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A glutathione S-transferase-NF1-334 proteins were all expressed at the same levels and with the same solubility. The wild-type and mutant NF1-334 proteins were >95% homogeneous by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrospray mass spectrometry gave the predicted molecular masses. The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum and near-UV and far-UV circular dichroism spectra of the three proteins were indistinguishable, suggesting that the mutations do not cause any gross structural perturbation. Mant nucleotides were used in these studies because they act as close analogues of guanine nucleotides and are fluorescent. The intrinsic rate constants for the hydrolysis of Ha-Ras·mantGTP was determined in experiments similar to those used for N-Ras·mantGTP to be 1.6 × 10−4s−1 (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The same result was obtained whether chemical cleavage or fluorescence changes were measured. The interaction of Ha-Ras·mantGTP with wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334 was investigated using single-turnover conditions (i.e. excess NF1-334) and monitoring mant fluorescence in a stopped-flow instrument. With wild-type NF1-334, on mixing with Ha-Ras·mantGTP, a biphasic fluorescence signal was obtained: first, a rapid increase in fluorescence followed by a slower decrease in fluorescence. The time course of this biphasic reaction is shown over 80 ms (Fig. 2 a) and 800 ms (Fig. 2 d). The data were fitted to a double exponential. In this example, at 2 μm wild-type NF1-334, the observed first-order rate constants are 22 s−1 and 12 s−1 respectively. The dependence of these rate constants on the concentration of NF1-334 was investigated and the results shown in Fig. 3, a and d.Figure 3Dependence of the rate constants involved in the interaction of Ha-Ras·mantGTP with wild-type and mutant NF1-334 on the concentration of NF1-334. Experiments similar to those shown in Fig. 2 were performed at final concentrations of NF1 between 1 and 12 μm. Observed first-order rate constants of both processes were plotted against NF1-334 concentration. The rate constants for the fast phase of wild-type NF1-334 (a), R1276A NF1-334 (b), and R1391A NF1-334 (c) show a linear dependence of NF1-334 concentrations with slopes of 7.9 × 106, 5.4 × 106, and 3.8 × 106m−1 s−1 and intercepts of 25, 16, and 50 s−1, respectively. The rate constants for the slow phase of wild-type NF1-334 (d), R1276A NF1-334 (e), and R1391A NF1-334 (f) showed a hyperbolic dependence on NF1 concentration with Kd values of 1.2, 1.2, and 2.6 μm and limiting rate constants of 23, 0.02, and 0.04 s−1 respectively. Errors in these values are discussed in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The above experiments were repeated using R1276A NF1-334 (Fig. 2,b and e) and R1391A NF1-334 (Fig. 2, cand f) proteins. With both mutant proteins, an initial rapid increase in fluorescence occurred (Fig. 2, b and c) followed by a decrease of fluorescence at rates about 3 orders of magnitude slower than the wild-type protein (Fig. 2,e and f). The effect of NF1-334 concentration on both the fast phase and slow phase of the reactions was studied for both mutant NF1-334 proteins. Because the fast and slow processes for both mutant proteins differ by more than 2 orders of magnitude, the data over the appropriate time range were fitted in each case to a single exponential. The effect of NF1-334 concentration on the observed rate constants of the initial rapid increase in fluorescence and of the subsequent decrease in fluorescence for R1276A (Fig. 3, b and e) and R1391A (Fig. 3, c and f) are shown. In a separate experiment, 0.2 μm Ha-Ras·mantGTP was mixed with 10 μm R1276A NF1-334 at 30 °C. Samples were taken at intervals and analyzed for mantGTP and mantGDP by high performance liquid chromatography. The fluorescence intensity was also monitored with time. The fluorescence decrease was fitted to a single exponential with a rate constant of 0.025 s−1. The formation of mantGDP could also be fitted to a single exponential with the identical rate constant, indicating that the fluorescence decrease monitored mantGTP hydrolysis (data not shown). The binding of N-Ras·GTP with a GAP (in this case p120-GAP) has previously been proposed (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3562-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) to occur by a two-step mechanism in which the initial binding step is followed by a conformational change that precedes and limits the cleavage step. This was based on the observation that although mantGMPPNP is not hydrolyzed by Ras, incubation of N-Ras·mantGMPPNP was accompanied by an exponential decrease in fluorescence that occurred with a similar rate constant to the hydrolysis of N-Ras·mantGTP (19Neal S.E. Eccleston J.F. Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3562-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and that this rate constant of the N-Ras·mantGMPPNP fluorescence decrease was accelerated by p120-GAP (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, Rensland et al. (20Rensland H. Lautwein A. Wittinghofer A. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11181-11185Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that a similar fluorescence decrease with Ha-Ras·mantGTPγS occurred that was 10–20-fold slower than for Ras·mantGTP and probably associated with hydrolysis, although this was not measured directly. Furthermore, the fluorescence change with Ha-Ras·mantGTPγS was not accelerated by p120-GAP. To clarify this discrepancy, we have repeated the experiment using N-Ras·mantGTPγS. A solution of 2.5 μmN-Ras·mantGTPγS was incubated at 37 °C. The fluorescence intensity was monitored with time and samples were also taken at intervals and analyzed for conversion of N-Ras·mantGTPγS to N-Ras·mantGDP. A 20% exponential decrease in fluorescence occurred with a rate constant of 2.2 × 10−5s−1, which was within the experimental error of the rate constant for the formation of N-Ras·mantGDP (2.7 × 10−5s−1), inconsistent with the conformational change being rate-limiting. Furthermore, the experiment of Moore et al. (17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 17Moore K.J.M. Webb M.R. Eccleston J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) could not be repeated when NF1-334 replaced p120-GAP. With R1276A NF1-334 mutant proteins (see above), we have compared the chemical cleavage rate with the fluorescence change at a single NF1-334 concentration and have shown that they occur at the same rate. Therefore, we have assumed that the fluorescence intensity changes occur at the same rate as the cleavage process, as was previously done in Eccleston et al. (13Eccleston J.F. Moore K.J.M. Morgan L. Skinner R.H. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27012-27019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Ahmadian et al. (21Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and that cleavage is not controlled by a preceding conformational change. In this two-step model (Scheme 1) the initial fluorescence increase is due to binding and the subsequent fluorescence decrease is due to cleavage, and this process can be described by Equation 1.Ras·mantGTP+NF1­334⇌k1k−1Ras·mantGTP·NF1­334→k2Ras·mantGDP·Pi·NF1­334Equation EScheme 1 A mechanism involving a two-step binding process before cleavage has recently been proposed by Ahmadian et al. (21Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, for a comparison of the effects of mutations R1276A and R1391A on their interaction with Ha-Ras·mantGTP, Scheme 1 is at present sufficient. Fig. 3, a–c, shows that under these conditions, there is a linear relationship between kobs of the initial binding step and NF1-334 concentration for wild-type and mutant proteins. From Equation 1, the slope of the line givesk1 and the intercept givesk−1 + k2. Values fork1 are 7.9 × 106m−1s−1 for wild-type protein, 5.4 × 106m−1s−1 for R1276A, and 3.8 × 106m−1 s−1 for R1391A. Values of k−1 + k2 (from the intercept) are 25, 16, and 50 s−1 for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A respectively. For both mutant proteins, k2 is very small compared with these values, so they are essentially values fork−1. By use of the relationshipKd =k−1/k1, values ofKd for the two mutant proteins can be calculated to be 3.0 and 13.0 μm for R1276A and R1391A, respectively. For the wild-type protein, the intercept is at 25 s−1, which represents k2 + k−1. k2 is obtained from the limiting rate constant of the subsequent slow phase of decreasing fluorescence (Fig. 3 d) as discussed below and was found to be 23 s−1. It is therefore difficult to calculate accurately a value of k−1 because it involves the difference between two relatively large numbers. However, if an upper limit of 5 s−1 is placed on the difference between the intercept and k2, an upper limit forKd =k−1/k1 is 0.6 μm. The relationship between concentration of wild-type (Fig. 3 d), R1276A (Fig. 3 e), and R1391A (Fig. 3 f) NF1-334 concentration on the observed rate constant of the slow phase is shown in each case to be hyperbolic. Fitting this data to Equation 2, values of K1 were calculated to be 1.2, 1.2, and 2.6 μm and values fork2 were 23, 0.02, and 0.04 s−1 for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334, respectively. It is difficult to obtain data for the mutant proteins with very slow time course reactions (Fig. 3, e and f) as good as the data for the faster reactions of the wild-type protein, and there could be an error of a factor of 2 for the values of k2for mutant proteins. Also, the value of K1 for R1276A is an upper limit, as the observed rate constants are essentially independent of [NF1-334] (Fig. 3 e). The hyperbolic fit is based on the rate constant at zero NF1-334 being 1.6 × 10−4s−1, which is the rate constant for intrinsic mantGTP hydrolysis. The calculated equilibrium and kinetic rate constants for the interaction of Ha-Ras·mantGTP with wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A obtained by the above analysis are shown in Table I.Table IEquilibrium and kinetic rate constants of the interaction of Ha-Ras · mantGTP with wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334Neurofibromink11-aFrom the slope of the data, as in Fig. 3,a–c.k−11-bFrom the ordinate intercept of the data, as in Fig. 3,a–c.Kd1-cCalculated from Kd =k−1/k1.Kd1-dCalculated from hyperbolic dependence of slow phase.k21-eLimiting rate constant from data, as in Fig. 3,d–f.Activation1-fActivation of limiting rate constant compared to the intrinsic hydrolysis rate constant.m−1 s−1s−1μmμms−1foldWild-type7.9 × 106≤5≤0.61.2231.6 × 105R1276A5.4 × 106163.01.20.02130R1391A3.8 × 1065013.02.60.042501-a From the slope of the data, as in Fig. 3,a–c.1-b From the ordinate intercept of the data, as in Fig. 3,a–c.1-c Calculated from Kd =k−1/k1.1-d Calculated from hyperbolic dependence of slow phase.1-e Limiting rate constant from data, as in Fig. 3,d–f.1-f Activation of limiting rate constant compared to the intrinsic hydrolysis rate constant. Open table in a new tab Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP hydrolyses to the mantGDP complex with a rate constant of 1 × 10−5s−1, and this is activated by only a factor of 6 by wild-type NF1-334 (7Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J.M. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) This fact allows the binding of wild-type and mutant NF1-334 to Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP to be studied in isolation from the GTP cleavage step. On mixing Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP with excess wild-type (Fig. 4 a), R1276A (Fig. 4 b), or R1391A (Fig. 4 c) NF1-334, a single exponential increase in fluorescence occurred, and the observed rate constants from these experiments were linearly dependent on NF1-334 concentration (Fig. 4, d–f). From these data, using Equation 1, where k2 = 0, values ofk1 of 1.1 × 107, 5.2 × 106, and 3.0 × 106m−1s−1 and k−1 of <1, <1, and 40 s−1 were obtained for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A respectively. It should be noted that because of the significantly reduced binding of R1391A NF1-334 to Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP, signals were much smaller, and thus the errors in the derivative plot (Fig. 4 f) were greater. Values of k−1 were independently determined by displacement experiments in which the complex Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP·NF1-334 was rapidly mixed with excess Leu61Ha-Ras·GTP (Fig. 5). An exponential decrease in fluorescence occurred, representing the dissociation of Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP from NF1-334. Dissociation rate constants (k−1) were 0.8, 0.9, and 39 s−1 for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334, respectively. The values of k−1 obtained from the intercept of the association reactions and from the displacement experiments are consistent with each other. The values for the Kd were calculated from Kd =k−1/k1, wherek1 was obtained from the dependence ofkobs on [NF1-334], and k−1 was obtained from the displacement experiments. These values are 0.07, 0.17, and 13.0 μm for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334, respectively.

Open table in a new tab In this study, we have analyzed the effects of converting the Arg1276 and Arg1391 residues of NF1-334 to alanine residues. The effect of these mutations on the interaction of NF1-334 with Ha-Ras·nucleotide complexes has been shown by a combination of the use of a fluorescent nucleotide analogue, mantGTP, and single turnover conditions, in which the NF1-334 is in excess of Ha-Ras·mantGTP. An advantage of this method is that values of the rate constants governing the hydrolysis reaction can be measured over a time scale of milliseconds to hours, so that values of the mantGTPase rate between the Ha-Ras intrinsic rate constant of 1.6 × 10−4s−1 and the wild-type NF1 activated rate constant of 23 s−1 can be measured. Single turnover conditions also give information about the binding step that precedes GTP hydrolysis. The rate constant of the slow fluorescence change accompanying hydrolysis showed a hyperbolic dependence on NF1-334 concentration, and the limiting rate constant was the rate constant of mantGTPase cleavage. The rate constant for the intrinsic Ha-Ras·mantGTP hydrolysis is 1.6 × 10−5s−1, and this is accelerated to 23 s−1 (Fig. 3 d) by wild-type NF1-334 but only to 0.02 s−1 (Fig. 3 e) and 0.04 s−1 (Fig. 3 f) by R1276A and R1391A NF1-334, respectively. These two arginine residues, therefore, play an important role in the activation of the hydrolysis of GTP by NF1-334. However, our data show that neither arginine is absolutely essential for activation of catalysis, because the mutant protein can still increase the Ras·mantGTPase by over 100-fold. Thus, it is likely that other interactions of Ras with NF1-334, besides these with the conserved arginine residues, contribute to catalysis by NF1. The Q61L and G12P Ras mutants (13Eccleston J.F. Moore K.J.M. Morgan L. Skinner R.H. Lowe P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27012-27019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) bind RasGAP normally, and the L902I RasGAP mutant (7Brownbridge G.G. Lowe P.N. Moore K.J.M. Skinner R.H. Webb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10914-10919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) binds Ras normally, yet these proteins all show around a 1000-fold reduction in GAP-stimulated GTPase. This supports the suggestion that the catalysis of Ras GTPase by GAPs cannot be simply ascribed to a single arginine residue. Rather, the role of the GAP interaction is both to contribute a catalytically important arginine residue and also to stabilize the precise geometry of the transition state for catalysis. One possible mechanism would be that the conformation of Ras is altered or a specific conformation is stabilized upon binding to NF1-334. Indeed, it has been noted that the Switch II region of Ras, which contains the catalytically important residue Gln61, is well defined in the x-ray structure of the Ras·p120-GAP structure but is highly mobile in Ras alone (5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). A similar observation has been made by Rittinger et al. (22Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) for the interaction of Rho with Rho-GAP. In addition to measurements of the activation of Ras·mantGTP by the wild-type and mutant NF1-334 proteins, the data can also be analyzed to give information about the binding affinity of the initial interaction of Ras·mantGTP with NF1-334. Two approaches were made to calculate this affinity. First, an estimate was made for the value ofk−1 as described under “Results,” and this value combined with k1 to giveKd or an upper estimate of it. Values obtained for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A by this method were <0.6, 3.0, and 13.0 μm, respectively. Second, the initial binding step was assumed to be a rapid equilibrium, and the value of the Kd was obtained from the hyperbolic dependence of the rate constant of the slow phase. The limitations of this approach and the data are described under “Results.” The values obtained by this method for wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334 are 1.2, ≤1.2, and 2.6 μm, respectively. Values for wild-type and R1276A NF1-334 are in reasonable agreement for the two methods, but those for R1391A NF1-334 are not. The reason for this discrepancy may be that the binding step is not a single step. Evidence that this is a more complex process has been described (21Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, in comparison with the dramatic effect of mutating Arg1276 and Arg1391on the catalytic activity of NF1-334, there is only a small effect on binding. The analysis of the data of interaction of Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP with wild-type and mutant NF1-334 is more straightforward, as under the conditions used, this interaction can be interpreted as a single second-order reaction. The second-order rate constant for the binding of wild-type NF1-334 to Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP is 1.1 × 107m−1s−1, and this is reduced in R1276A and R1391A NF1-334 to 5.2 × 106 and 3.0 × 106m−1s−1, respectively. This reduced rate of binding is similar to that of wild-type Ha-Ras·mantGTP and could be caused by a change in the ionic interactions of the two proteins. Although the dissociation rate constants of wild-type and R1276A NF1-334 from Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP are almost identical, it is increased by a factor of >40 in the R1391A NF1-334 mutant. The effects of the mutations on k1 and k−1result in the Kd for the interactions between wild-type, R1276A, and R1391A NF1-334 and Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP being 0.07, 0.17, and 13.0 μm, respectively. R1276A, therefore, has little effect on the binding between Leu61Ha-Ras and NF1-334, but R1391A has a much greater effect. The Kd for the interaction of Leu61Ha-Ras·mantGTP to wild-type NF1-334 is 10-fold tighter than for wild-type Ha-Ras·mantGTP. This differential binding is maintained in the R1276A NF1-334 mutation but not in the R1391A NF1-334 mutation, where the affinities are similar or weaker. This suggests that the high affinity of Leu61Ha-Ras for wild-type NF1-334 is related to an interaction with, or is dependent on, Arg1391 of NF1-334. Examination of the structure of the Ras·GDP·AlF3/p120-GAP complex (5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) suggests that in wild-type NF1 there might be a hydrophobic interaction between the side chain of Leu61 of Ras and of the hydrophobic backbone of the side chain of Arg1391 of NF1. This would be lost on mutation of Arg1391 to R1391A, thus accounting for the biochemical observation. Although there are several reports on the effects of mutations of Arg1276 and Arg1391 of NF1 and, in the homologous residues of p120-GAP, Arg789 and Arg903, the results and their interpretation are conflicting (6Skinner R.H.

Very likely, part of the explanation for this is that the effects of mutation on kcat and Kd have not always been measured. Although there is currently no x-ray structure of NF1, structures of the Ras-binding domain of p120-GAP both on its own and in complex with Ras·GDP·AlF3 have recently been published (4Scheffzek K. Lautwein A. Kabsch W. Ahmadian M.R. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1996; 384: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Judging from the close sequence homologies between the catalytic domain of p120-GAP and NF1, the overall structure of these two proteins in the region of interaction with Ras is likely to be very similar, and hence the role in catalysis of residues Arg1276 and Arg1391 of NF1 is likely to be identical to that of the homologous residues Arg789 and Arg903 of p120-GAP. The x-ray structure of p120-GAP shows that both Arg789 and Arg903 of p120-GAP are in proximity both to each other and to the proposed location of the γ phosphate in the complex with Ras-GTP. Because the guanidinium group of Arg903 contacts the main chain in the region of Arg789, the possibility was suggested that Arg789 is used for catalysis, whereas Arg903stabilizes the conformation of Arg789. The experimental data presented here are fully consistent with this hypothesis. The GAP domains of RhoGAP and RasGAP show no clear tertiary structural similarity and hence are unlikely to be evolutionarily homologous. Despite this, there are several parallels. Primarily, the x-ray structures reveal that conserved arginine residues fulfill similar structural (5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 22Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and catalytic roles (data herein and Refs. 5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar and23Graham D.L. Eccleston J.F. Lowe P.N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 512SCrossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). These residues are Arg1276 of NF1 (Arg789of p120 GAP) and Arg282 (termed Arg85 in Ref.22Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) of RhoGAP (Fig. 1). Interestingly, these residues are also in a similar sequence environment (see Fig. 1). There appears to be a further structural analogy relating to Arg1391 of NF1 (Arg903 of p120GAP). There is a similarity in the sequence surrounding this residue and that near the conserved Lys319of RhoGAP (Fig. 1) and also in their role in stabilizing the structure of the catalytic arginine. Thus, the amino group of Lys319in RhoGAP interacts with the main chain Arg282 (22Rittinger K. Walker P. Eccleston J.F. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and in RasGAP, the guanidino group of Arg903 (Arg1391of NF1) interacts with the main chain carbonyl of Arg789(Arg1276 of NF1) (5Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Weismuller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the two conserved arginines in NF1 are essential for efficient catalysis. This is consistent with the hypothesis, supported by structural and mechanistic studies, that the mechanism of RasGAPs involves transition state stabilization by direct involvement of an arginine residue contributed by GAP. It would seem likely that this might represent a more general mechanism for catalysis in GTPases, because an arginine residue has been demonstrated to be involved in catalysis in the Gα subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins (24Noel J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2035019286,"We previously have identified a novel cell surface heparan sulfate/heparin (HS/HP)-interacting protein (HIP) found in human uterine epithelia and a variety of other human epithelial and endothelial cells and cell lines (Liu, S., Smith, S.

The amino acid sequence predicted for HIP revealed a potential HS/HP-binding motif. In the present studies, a synthetic peptide corresponding to this putative HS/HP-binding motif, HIP peptide, was synthesized and examined with regard to its HS/HP binding and cell attachment promoting activity. Results using solid phase binding assays demonstrate that HIP peptide binds HS/HP with high selectivity and has high affinity for bulk HP (50% saturation ≅ 300 nm) and even higher affinity for a subset of polysaccharides found in commercial [3H]HP (half-saturation ≅ 10 nm). Moreover, HIP peptide binds subsets of cell and extracellular matrix-associated HS and dermatan sulfate expressed by RL95 cells, a human uterine adenocarcinoma cell line. HIP peptide also binds a similar fraction of HS as well as dermatan sulfate expressed by JAR cells, a human choriocarcinoma cell line. In contrast to binding of cell- or extracellular matrix-associated HS, HIP peptide does not bind secreted or released forms of HS or DS from either RL95 or JAR cells to a significant extent. HS species that bind to HIP peptide are generally larger, have a higher negative charge density, and have a larger proportion of di- and trisulfated disaccharide units than HS species that do not bind to HIP peptide, demonstrating structural differences among these polysaccharides. This same peptide supports HS-dependent JAR cell attachment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that a linear peptide sequence found within HIP can account, at least in part, for the HS/HP binding and cell adhesion promoting activities of this protein. We previously have identified a novel cell surface heparan sulfate/heparin (HS/HP)-interacting protein (HIP) found in human uterine epithelia and a variety of other human epithelial and endothelial cells and cell lines (Liu, S., Smith, S.

Complementary specific, high affinity HP/HS sites on the cell surface of mouse uterine epithelial cells also have been characterized (15Wilson O. Jacobs A.L. Stewart S. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 143: 60-67Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that HSPGs and their corresponding binding sites are involved in the initial attachment of mouse embryos to uterine epithelium. The initial attachment of the human trophoblastic cell line, JAR, to RL95 cells, a human uterine epithelial cell line, is HP/HS-dependent (16Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a single class of highly specific, cell surface HP/HS-binding sites has been identified on RL95 cell surfaces (17Raboudi N. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11930-11939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface, HP/HS-binding peptides were isolated from RL95 cells, and partial NH2-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained. A full-length cDNA sequence corresponding to one of these peptides was identified (1Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Predicted peptide sequence from this cDNA revealed an antigenic sequence that also has features expected for a HP/HS-binding motif (18Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R.

Polyclonal antibodies directed against this synthetic peptide recognize a novelHP/HS-interacting protein (HIP) with a Mr on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 24,000. HIP is expressed by a variety of epithelial and endothelial cells and cell lines and on RL95 cell surfaces (1Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol.

In addition, HIP is highly expressed by human cytotrophoblast at the fetal-maternal interface throughout pregnancy in juxtaposition to a potential HSPG ligand, perlecan (19Rohde L.H. Janatpore M.J.

In this paper, we describe functional studies on the synthetic peptide corresponding to this putative HP/HS-binding motif: CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK, referred to as HIP peptide. The current studies demonstrate that HIP peptide is a highly selective HP/HS-binding peptide, recognizes certain forms of HP and cell- and extracellular matrix-associated HS expressed by human cell lines, and can support the HS-dependent attachment of a human trophoblastic cell line. Therefore, this peptide motif can account, at least in part, for the HS/HP binding and adhesion promoting activities of HIP.

JAR and RL95 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and Ham's F-12 medium (F-12) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 units of penicillin/ml, and 50 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml. A synthetic peptide (HIP peptide) derived from HIP, a novel cell surface HS/HP-binding protein (1Liu S. Smith S.E. Julian J. Rohde L.H. Karin N.J. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 2Rohde L.H. Julian J. Babaknia A. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11824-11830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), CRPKAKAKAKAKDQTK, and a randomly scrambled peptide, CQKAKTRAKAAKPDKK, were synthesized on a Vega 250 peptide synthesizer using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) methodology (21Chang C.D. Meienhofer J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This synthetic peptide was conjugated to maleimide-activated BSA (Pierce) through the sulfhydryl group of cysteine in the peptide following the coupling protocol provided by the manufacturer. HIP peptide affinity matrix was formed by cross-linking the BSA-conjugated HIP peptide to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Sigma) in the presence of N-acetylated HP. Inclusion of acetylated HP was adopted to produce a more stable affinity matrix by shielding the HP-binding sites of the HIP peptide complex from cross-linking to the Sepharose beads. Acetylation of HP was performed following the method described previously (22Höök M. Bjork I. Hopwood J. Lindahl U. FEBS Lett. 1976; 66: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In a parallel study, three distinct affinity classes of HP, peaking at 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3 mNaCl, and 2.2 m NaCl, respectively, were separated by HIP peptide affinity chromatography using gradient elution (23Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore, in most cases, stepwise elution of HIP peptide affinity chromatography was employed. The HIP peptide affinity matrix was packed into a 3-ml column and equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl-PBS. [3H]HP or [35S]HS resuspended in 0.15m NaCl-PBS was loaded into the column. The column then was washed sequentially with 0.15 m NaCl-PBS (run-through (RT)-HP (or HS)), 0.45 m NaCl-PBS (low affinity (LA)-HP (or HS)), and 3.0 m NaCl-PBS (high affinity (HA)-HP (or HS)). Radioactivity of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Near confluent cultures of RL95 or JAR cells were rinsed several times with serum-free medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (minus sulfate) supplemented with 3.3 mmMgCl2, 1.2 g/liter NaHCO3, 15 mmHepes, pH 7.2, 2.5 units/ml penicillin, and 2.5 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Streptomycin sulfate served as the sole source of nonradioactive sulfate in this medium. The cells were incubated overnight in the same low sulfate medium described above containing 0.5 mCi/ml H2[35S]O4. For generation of 3H-labeled HS, RL95 cells were labeled overnight in media containing 25 μCi/ml [3H]glucosamine. The following day, the medium was collected and the cell layers were rinsed several times with ice-cold PBS. The cell layers then were incubated for 30 min on ice with PBS containing 50 μg/ml trypsin to release cell surface proteoglycans. Cells were not released from the tissue culture surfaces under these conditions, nor was cell viability compromised as indexed by trypan blue exclusion. The material released into the “trypsinate” was collected, the cell layers were rinsed several more times with ice-cold PBS, and the cells scraped from the tissue culture surface with a rubber policeman into ice-cold water. The trypsinate was placed in a boiling water bath for 2–3 min and immediately cooled on ice to inactivate the trypsin. Isolation of35S-labeled extracellular matrix was performed following the method described (24Vlodavsky I. Lui G.M. Gospodarowitz D. Cell. 1980; 19: 607-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, approximately 50% confluent cultures of RL95 cells were labeled with the same H2[35S]O4-containing low sulfate medium as described above for 3 days. Cells then were washed with PBS twice, and dissolved with PBS containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mm NH4OH for 5 min at room temperature. Afterward, the dish was washed four times with PBS, and the extracellular matrix was collected using a rubber policeman. All fractions then were precipitated with 10% (w/v) trichloracetic acid, 3% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid as described previously (25Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellets were resuspended in 1–2 ml of 0.5 m urea, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.01% (w/v) octylglucoside, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide and fractionated by Mono Q anion exchange chromatography exactly as described (25Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The material eluting from the column with 2–4 m NaCl constituted 90% or more of the total radioactivity in all cases and was pooled and extensively dialyzed against PBS. [35S]HS or [35S]DS was isolated following β-elimination as described (11Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and used for HIP peptide binding assays. The size of RL95 cell surface-derived35S-labeled HS used for the solid phase binding assays was determined as described (26Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). Specific activity was calculated based on the specific activity used for metabolic labeling (50 μCi/nmol) and assuming an average sulfate content of 1.5 sulfate residues/HS disaccharide unit. Where indicated, the fractions were further analyzed by digestion with glycosaminoglycan lyases or nitrous acid as described in detail previously (16Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HS was defined as sensitive (>95%) to nitrous acid digestion and insensitive to chondroitinase AC or ABC digestion. Dermatan sulfate was defined as sensitive (>95%) to chondroitinase ABC digestion, but insensitive to chondroitinase AC or nitrous acid digestion. 35S- or 3H-labeled HS fractions from RL95 cells were prepared as described above and exhaustively digested with Pronase and subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis to remove associated peptides as described (25Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residual chondroitin and dermatan sulfate contaminants were removed by digestion with chondroitinase ABC as described previously (25Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RT-HS, LA-HS, and HA-HS were prepared by stepwise salt elution from a HIP peptide affinity matrix as described above. HS disaccharides were prepared by digestion at room temperature with 1 unit/ml each of heparinase I, II, and III (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0) plus 2 mm CaCl2 and 2 mmMgCl2. After 24 h an additional 1 unit/ml amount of each enzyme was added. Mono Q anion exchange liquid chromatography was performed on these fractions using 2 m urea, 20 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide as buffer A and the same buffer containing 4 m NaCl as buffer B. The column was run at room temperature at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The gradient conditions were: 3 min of buffer A followed by a 25 min linear gradient to 100% buffer B, followed by 2 min during which 100% buffer B was maintained. Fractions were collected every minute and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Recoveries of radioactivity were routinely >95%. Superose 12 liquid chromatography was performed exactly as described previously (25Tang J.-P. Julian J. Glasser S.R. Carson D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12832-12842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strong anion exchange liquid chromatography was performed to analyze HS disaccharides and was patterned after Tekotte et al. (27Tekotte H. Engel M. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with several modifications. A 4.6 mm (inner diameter) × 25-cm Hydropore-5-AX HPLC column (Rainin Instrument Co., Inc., Woburn, MA) was equilibrated with 0.2 m NaCl (pH 3.5) as buffer 1 and 2 m NaCl used as buffer 2. The column was eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at room temperature. The gradient conditions were 100% buffer 1 for 4 min, followed by a 4-min linear gradient to 25% buffer 2, maintenance of 25% buffer 2 for 12 min, followed by a step increase to 55% buffer 2, which then was maintained for 16 min followed by a 3-min linear gradient to 100% buffer 2 to elute any residual material. Every sample run included the presence of 10 μg of a heparin disaccharide mix containing equal amounts of eight heparin disaccharide standards described in the legend to Fig. 5. Elution of these internal standards was monitored at 232 nm using a Beckman model 163 flow-through variable wavelength spectrophotometer. Fractions were collected every 0.5 min, and elution of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Recoveries of radioactivity exceeded 95% in all cases. [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide was performed in 96-well microassay plates (Corning, Corning, NY). Fifty μl of BSA-conjugated HIP peptide in PBS (100 μg/ml), as well as the same amount and concentration of other controls, was added to each well and dried at 37 °C overnight. The next day, each well was rinsed with 200 μl of PBS three times, and 100 μl of 0.1% (w/v) heat-denatured BSA (80 °C for 30 min) was added and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for at least 1 h. Afterward, the wells were rinsed with 200 μl of PBS three times, and then 50 μl of [3H]HP (or [35S]HS)-containing reaction mixture ([3H]HP typically was added at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 dpm/well (approximately 300 nm) along with 0.1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS in PBS) was added, and incubated in a 37 °C incubator overnight. There were no differences in the amount of [3H]HP bound after two to four washes under these conditions. Therefore, the amount of bound radioactivity detected after three washes was considered to represent a functional equilibrium and was used to calculateKD(app). Where indicated, unlabeled HP, bovine kidney HS, bovine intestinal mucosa HS, chondroitin sulfates A and C, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, or hyaluronic acid were included as competitors. At the end of each experiment, unbound [3H]HP (or [35S]HS) was removed with 200 μl of PBS three times. Bound [3H]HP (or [35S]HS) was extracted from each well by overnight incubation at 37 °C with 100 μl of extraction buffer: 4m guanidine HCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Half of the extract was counted in a Beckman scintillation counter. Cell attachment assays employed 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar). Each well was coated either with 200 μl of BSA-conjugated HIP peptide (100 μg/ml) or with the same amount of other controls. The plates were incubated in a 37 °C incubator. The next day, each well was rinsed with 0.5 ml of PBS three times. Subsequently, 500 μl of 0.1% (w/v) heat-denatured BSA in PBS was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for at least 1 h. Each well was rinsed again with 0.5 ml of PBS three times prior to the addition of cells. JAR cells were grown to approximately 90% confluence. Cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA solution for 5 to 10 min at 37 °C, washed with DMEM/F-12 (1:1) plus 0.1% (w/v) BSA three times, and resuspended in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) plus 0.1% (w/v) BSA. This cell suspension (5–10 × 104cells/well) was then added to the wells coated as described above, and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for the time periods indicated in each experiment. At the end of each experiment, unattached cells were gently rinsed away with 0.5 ml of PBS three times, and the relative cell attachment was determined using the hexosaminidase assay as described (28Landegren V. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 377-388Crossref Scopus (603) Google Scholar). A variety of GAGs, including unlabeled HP, bovine kidney HS bovine intestinal mucosa HS, chondroitin sulfates A and C, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid, were used as competitors in assays of cell attachment to HIP peptide. Different GAGs (100 or 200 μg/ml as indicated) were included in the incubation medium for cell attachment assay in the competition studies. To determine if cell surface HP/HS or other GAGs of JAR cells mediate JAR cell attachment to HIP peptide, some cell attachment assays were performed in the presence of different GAG lyases (500 milliunits/ml), including heparinases I, II, and III, chondroitinases AC and ABC, with the addition of a protease inhibitor solution (11Farach M.C. Tang J.-P. Decker G.L. Carson D.D. Dev. Biol. 1987; 123: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Solid phase assays were employed to determine the HP/HS binding activity of HIP peptide. Preliminary studies established that a coating concentration at 100 μg/ml HIP peptide in PBS gave optimal binding for both [3H]HP and cell attachment. Furthermore, [3H]HP did not bind to BSA or BSA conjugated to an irrelevant peptide (CSSLSYTNPAVAATSANL) corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail region of the mucin, MUC1 (29Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, 100 μg/ml HIP peptide was used typically in [3H]HP or [35S]HS binding and cell attachment studies. In addition, solid-phase assays also were performed using HIP peptide not conjugated to maleimide-activated BSA as coating material, and similar results were obtained as described above for BSA-conjugated HIP peptide (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate HP binding was to HIP peptide and not the BSA carrier. [3H]HP binding also was time-dependent, reaching maximal values within 10–15 min (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 A, [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide is concentration-dependent with a 50% saturation at approximately 245 nm when these data are analyzed as a Scatchard plot (Fig. 1 A, inset). Four separate experiments yielded an average 50% saturation point of 300 nm. A peptide with the same amino acid composition as HIP peptide, but with a scrambled sequence, CQKAKTRAKAAKPDKK, bound [3H]HP with a 10–20-fold lower affinity than HIP peptide (data not shown). Therefore, the peptide sequence, rather than composition, was crucial to obtain high affinity binding. In a parallel study, HIP peptide affinity chromatography of commercial [3H]HP revealed three affinity classes of HP (RT-HP, LA-HP, and HA-HP) with regard to binding to HIP peptide (23Liu S. Zhou F. Höök M. Carson D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine the affinity of HA-HP binding to HIP peptide, HA-HP was collected and subjected to the solid-phase HIP peptide binding assay. Fig. 1 B shows that HIP peptide binds HA-HP with higher affinity (50% saturation at approximately 10 nm) than bulk HP. Thus, these results suggest that HIP peptide can recognize and bind certain forms of HP better than other forms of HP. Selectivity of [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide was determined using different GAGs, including unlabeled heparin (HP), bovine kidney HS (HS-BK), bovine intestinal mucosa HS (HS-BIM), chondroitin sulfate A (CS-A), dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate C (CS-C), keratan sulfate (KS), and hyaluronic acid (HA), as competitors. As shown in Fig. 2, HP most effectively inhibited [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide. Dermatan sulfate at 100 μg/ml inhibited [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide; however, other GAGs were ineffective in this regard (Fig. 2). We noticed that commercially available HS (HS-BIM and HS-BK) did not significantly inhibit HP binding to HIP peptide. As shown below, this agrees with other lines of evidence, indicating that only certain forms of HS bind to HIP peptide. A dose dependence study demonstrated that HP was approximately 50-fold more effective than dermatan sulfate at inhibiting [3H]HP binding to HIP peptide (Fig. 2,inset). Collectively these studies demonstrated that HIP peptide binds HP much more selectively than other GAGs. Fig. 3 shows that, in solid-phase assays, [35S]HS isolated from RL95 cell surfaces binds to HIP peptide in a concentration-dependent and saturable fashion. Previous studies established the median molecular weight of cell surface HS chains of RL95 cells (26Marchetti D. McQuillan D.J. Spohn W.C. Carson D.D. Nicolson G.L. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2856-2863PubMed Google Scholar). Assuming the specific activity of the [35S]sulfate in these HS preparations was similar to that of the sulfate precursor used for metabolic labeling, a 50% saturation point of approximately 0.2 nm was estimated. Inclusion of 100 μg/ml unlabeled HP inhibited almost all of this binding (>90%). Furthermore, HS isolated from cell surfaces of various breast cancer cell lines also specifically binds to HIP peptide (30Jacobs A.L. Julian J. Sahin A.A. Carson D.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5148-5154PubMed Google Scholar). Collectively, these data illustrate that certain forms of HS expressed at the cell surface or the extracellular matrix by human cells binds to HIP peptide. Given the ability of dermatan sulfate to partially compete for [3H]HP binding in the solid phase assays as well as in JAR cell adhesion assays (see Ref. 16Rohde L.H. Carson D.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 155: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, and studies below), [35S]O4-labeled HS and dermatan sulfate were isolated from either RL95 or JAR cells and tested for HIP peptide binding by HIP peptide affinity chromatography. Representative HIP peptide affinity column elution profiles of [35S]DS and [35S]HS are shown in Fig. 4(A and B, respectively). These experiments demonstrate that a much higher percentage of cell-associated glycosaminoglycans bound to HIP peptide than secreted forms. In most fractions"
https://openalex.org/W2036645110,"A novel C-type lectin that agglutinates rabbit red cells was purified from NIH-Sape-4 cells derived from the flesh fly (Sarcophaga peregrina), and its cDNA was isolated. This lectin, named granulocytin, appeared to be a trimer of a 20-kDa subunit consisting of 151 amino acid residues. The gene for granulocytin was activated in third instar larvae, and its expression was enhanced when the larval body wall was injured. In third instar larvae, granulocytin was found to be synthesized by hemocytes and secreted into the hemolymph. The molecular mass and gene expression patterns of granulocytin were very similar to those of Drosophilalectin that we reported previously (Haq, S., Kubo, T., Kurata, S., Kobayashi, A., and Natori, S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 20213–20218). However, these two lectins showed amino acid identities of 20% at most, and no significant hapten sugar for granulocytin was identified.

Insects respond to microbial infection through cellular and humoral defense mechanisms and are known to secrete various antimicrobia proteins and lectins into their hemolymph in response to bacterial challenges and body injury (1Boman H.G.

Bulet P. Cociancich S. Dimarcq J.-L. Hoffmann D. Hoffmann J.A. Hoffmann J.A. Janeway C.A. Natori S. Phylogenetic Perspectives in Immunity: the Insect Host Defense. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 43-65Google Scholar), the primary sequences of very few insect lectins have been determined. In a previous study, we purified a galactose-binding C-type lectin from the hemolymph of immunized larvae of Sarcophaga peregrina(flesh fly) and characterized it (15Komano H. Mizuno D. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2919-2924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Komano H. Mizuno D. Natori S. J. Biol.

This lectin (Sarcophaga lectin) was a large molecule with a molecular mass of 190 kDa, consisting of 32- and 30-kDa subunits in a molar ratio of 2:1. These two subunits were essentially the same protein derived from a single gene, and their difference in size was due to glycosylation. Sarcophaga lectin was found to be needed for the elimination of sheep red cells introduced into the larval body cavity (18Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 1985; 9: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It was also found to play roles in imaginal disc differentiation, suggesting that Sarcophaga lectin functions in both defense and development of this insect (19Kawaguchi N. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Biol. 1991; 144: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Natori S. Res. Immunol. 1990; 141: 938-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Natori S. Hoffmann J.A. Janeway C.A. Natori S. Phylogenetic Perspectives in Immunity: the Insect Host Defense. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1994: 67-75Google Scholar). To study the biological role of Sarcophaga lectin in the development of this insect, we identified its specific binding protein with a molecular mass of 10 kDa (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This binding protein was isolated from the membrane fraction of NIH-Sape-4 cells, an embryonic cell line of Sarcophaga, and was shown to be distributed heterogeneously on the surface of imaginal discs (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Incidentally, we found that a protein that reacted with a monoclonal antibody raised against the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein was a novel C-type lectin of this insect. In this paper, we report the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of this new lectin named granulocytin. Sarcophaga peregrina was reared by the methods of Ohtaki (23Ohtaki T. Jpn. J. Med. Biol. 1966; 19: 97-104Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hemolymph was collected by cutting off the anterior tip of a third instar larva with fine scissors and collecting the drop of hemolymph that exuded into 5 ml of insect saline (130 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2). Hemocytes were collected by centrifuging the hemolymph solution for 3 min at 100 × g at 4 °C, and the fat body was excised from each larva under a binocular microscope. TheSarcophaga embryonic cell line, NIH-Sape-4, was used throughout (24Komano H. Kasama E. Nagasawa Y. Matsuyama K. Ando K. Natori S. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). NIH-Sape-4 cells were cultured in M-M medium (120 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.4 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm NaH2PO4, 1.4 mmNaHCO, 4 mg/ml glucose, 5 mg/ml yeast, extract (DIFCO), 6.5 mg/ml Tc lactoalbumin (DIFCO) (25Mitsuhashi J.

A monoclonal anti-Sarcophagalectin-binding protein antibody, SLB1, was raised as reported previously (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). SLB1-Sepharose was prepared by coupling 20 mg of SLB1 with 5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions, suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), and stored at 4 °C until required for use. NIH-Sape-4 cells (20 g) were suspended in 400 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 100 mm galactose and homogenized in a glass homogenizer with a Teflon pestle. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100 × g for 1 min to remove the cell debris, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The resulting precipitate was washed twice by repeating centrifugation, suspended in 200 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, kept for 1 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was used as the solubilized protein fraction. The solubilized protein was diluted 4-fold with 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and applied to an SLB1-Separose column (1 × 5 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 150 mmNaCl and 0.125% Nonidet P-40. The column was washed well, and the adsorbed material was eluted with the above buffer containing 8m urea. This fraction was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 40 mmoctylglucoside and 150 mm NaCl, concentrated to about 500 ml, and then subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A protein that reacted with SLB1 was recovered in the flow-through fraction. At this stage, the protein was pure enough to yield a single 20-kDa band after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. An antibody was raised against the 20-kDa protein and affinity-purified using the method described previously (27Homma K. Natori S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 28Homma K. Matsushita T. Natori S. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 30Homma K. Kurata S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15258-15264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were screened with this affinity-purified antibody and the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). For nucleotide sequencing of the cDNA, the insert DNA was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using aTaq dye terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The nucleotide sequences of both strands were determined. Northern blot hybridization was performed using a reaction mixture comprised of 50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE contains 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmNa2PO4, 1 mm EDTA), 1× Denhardt's solution (0.02% (w/v) each of Ficoll-400, bovine serum albumin, and polyvinylpyrrolidone), 0.1% SDS and sonicated salmon sperm DNA solution (200 μg/ml) for 18 h at 42 °C. Then, the filters were washed for 30 min each with 2× SSC (1× SSC contains 0.15m NaCl, 0.05 m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature and 42 °C and finally autoradiographed at −80 °C. The DNA used as a probe was the 20-kDa protein cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP usng a random primer labeling kit (Takara, Tokyo). Electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel was carried out by the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Samples were denatured by boiling them for 5 min in 1% SDS containing 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and after electrophoresis, the gel was stained using the method of Fairbanks et al. (32Fairbanks G. Steck T.L. Wallach D.F.H. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6175) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins separated by electrophoresis were transferred electrophoretically from the gel onto filters (Immobilon-P, Millipore), which were immersed in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.9) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk for 1 h. After washing with a rinsing solution (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.9, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide, and 0.25% skim milk), they were dipped in rinsing solution containing the affinity-purified antibody against the 20-kDa protein and kept for 1 h. Then, they were washed well with rinsing solution, transferred to 5 ml rinsing solution containing radioiodinated anti-rabbit IgG (18.5 kBq), and kept at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, they were washed well with rinsing solution, dried, and subjected to autoradiography using Kodak XAR film. Rabbit red blood cells (RRBC) 1The abbreviations used are: RRBC, rabbit red blood cells; CRD, carbohydrate recognition domain. were washed well and suspended in buffered insect saline. To measure hemagglutinating activity, 25 μl of serially diluted sample solution was mixed with 25 μl of 2.5% (w/v) RRBC suspension in a well of a V-bottomed microtiter plate, and then incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Agglutinated RRBC formed a diffuse mat, whereas unagglutinated RRBC formed a clear dot on the well bottom. Hemocytes were suspended in buffered insect saline at a density of approximately 106cells/ml, and 15 μl of suspension was placed in each well of a 12-well multitest slide. The hemocytes were allowed to settle for 15 min at room temperature, fixed for 10 min by adding 15 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.02% glutaraldehyde, phosphate-buffered saline, the slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 100 mm glycine, 1% bovine serum albumin, phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The blocking reagent was replaced with 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% NaN3 and the slides were stored at 4 °C. 20 μl of affinity-purified antibody solution (20 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the antibody solution was removed, 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody solution was added, the slides were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed, mounted, and observed using an Olympus BH-2 fluorescence microscope. In a previous study, we isolated a Sarcophagalectin-binding protein from NIH-Sape-4 cells and raised a monoclonal antibody, named SLB1, against it as described before (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To purify the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein in quantity from the membrane fraction of NIH-Sape-4 cells, we performed affinity chromatography using SLB1-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B followed by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column. The protein thus obtained yield a broad band with a molecular mass of 20 kDa after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Unlike the 10-kDaSarcophaga lectin-binding protein, this 20-kDa protein showed essentially no Sarcophaga lectin binding activity, indicating that it is not the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein we characterized before (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the intact protein, estimated from the elution volume from a molecular sieve column of Suparose 12, was 60 kDa, suggesting that the intact protein is a trimer of the 20-kDa subunit. About 100 μg of 20-kDa protein was obtained from 4 × 1010 NIH-Sape-4 cells. To characterize this 20-kDa protein further, we raised a polyclonal antibody against the purified protein, affinity-purified it and used it for immunoblotting and cDNA cloning. Immunoblotting revealed that not only NIH-Sape-4 cells, but also their culture medium contained this 20-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A). The immunoreactive proteins in the culture medium that migrated faster than the 20-kDa protein were probably its degradation products. These results suggest that the 20-kDa protein is not a membrane protein, but a secretory protein, which was confirmed by detecting the 20-kDa protein in hemolymph. As shown in Fig. 2 B, this protein was detected in hemocytes, hemolymph, and fat bodies from third instar larvae, suggesting that this protein is a hemolymph protein, produced possibly by the hemocytes and fat body of third instar larvae. To determine the amino acid sequence of the 20-kDa protein, we tried to isolate its cDNA by screening an NIH-Sape-4 cDNA library with the affinity-purified antibody. Three positive clones had identical nucleotide sequences, and the protein encoded in this cDNA contained five peptides obtained by digesting purified 20-kDa protein with trypsin: WFK, LITLK, TYREDELLSQYLK, QTYQPLPEFWLR, and ANDNIDLSDINK. The 13 amino-terminal residues, APLTKWFKTDNNT, which we determined separately, were also present in this protein. Therefore, we concluded that this is cDNA for the 20-kDa protein. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences encoded in this cDNA are shown in Fig. 3. The amino-terminal residue of the 20-kDa protein was assigned as Ala at position 23. Therefore, this cDNA was shown to encode the 20-kDa protein consisting of 151 residues and its leader peptide consisting of 22 residues. Two possible N-glycosylation sites (33Marshall R.D. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1974; 40: 7-26Google Scholar), Asn-Asn-Thr and Asn-Ser-Thr, were found in the 20-kDa protein. Therefore, we examined whether the purified 20-kDa protein was deglycosylated by treating it with N-glycanase and subjecting the product to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine its molecular mass. The broad band of intact 20-kDa protein shifted to the 14-kDa position and became a sharp band, suggesting that the 20-kDa protein is a glycoprotein (Fig. 4).Figure 4Digestion of the purified 20-kDa protein withN-glycanase. The purified 20-kDa protein (5 mg) was incubated with or without 1 unit of N-glycanase for 18 h at 37 °C, and the mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Lanes: 1, withN-glycanase; 2, without N-glycanase;3, purified 20-kDa protein. The gel was calibrated as described in the legend to Fig. 1, and the asteriskindicates the position of N-glycanase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As shown in Fig. 5, the 20-kDa protein was found to contain a carbohydrate recognition domain(CRD)-like sequence with significant similarity (20–27%) to the CRDs ofDrosophila (34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and Sarcophaga lectin (35Takahashi H. Komano H. Kawaguchi N. Kitamura S. Nakanishi S. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12228-12233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This sequence was found to contain four Cys residues that are conserved in the CRDs of many C-type lectins (36Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the 20-kDa protein is a C-type lectin, but it lacked two of three residues, Glu and Asp, which are reported to be responsible for sugar and calcium binding (37Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 38Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the 20-kDa protein was about the same as that of Drosophila lectin. As the 20-kDa protein was found to be structurally related to Sarcophagaand Drosophila C-type lectins, we examined its hemagglutinating activity using various red cells in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. No agglutination of sheep, pig, chicken, horse, guinea pig, bovine, or human red cells was observed, but significant agglutination of RRBC did occur. Calcium was essential for this hemagglutinating activity, indicating that the 20-kDa protein is a C-type lectin. Next we examined the effects of various carbohydrates on the hemagglutinating activity of the 20-kDa protein. No specific hapten sugar has been identified in the monosaccharides tested so far. Glucose, galactose, fucose, xylose, rhamnose, N-acetylmuramic acid, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (all at 100 mm) inhibited the hemagglutinating activity by 50%. Bovine submaxillary gland mucin (10 μg/ml) inhibited the hemagglutinating activity, but porcine stomach mucin had no inhibitory effect. Lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0111,B4 was a weak inhibitor (100 μg/ml) but the other lipopolysaccharides tested showed no inhibitory effects. This carbohydrate specificity was clearly different from those of Sarcophaga and Drosophilalectins, the hapten sugars of which were identified as galactose (15Komano H. Mizuno D. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2919-2924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As the 20-kDa protein was found to be a novel C-type lectin of Sarcophagasynthesized by hemocytes, we investigated which cells produce this protein by carrying out an immunofluorescence study. As shown in Fig. 6, fluorescence was detected only in large granulocytes not in other cells such as a spindly cell indicated by the arrow, which is probably a plasmatocyte. These results indicate that this protein is produced by large granulocytes. Furthermore, the fluorescence in these cells was distributed heterogeneously and seemed to be concentrated in the granules, suggesting that the 20-kDa protein is stored in the granules and eventually secreted into the hemolymph. To differentiate this novel lectin from Sarcophaga lectin, we named it granulocytin. Immunoblotting detected granulocytin both in hemocytes and fat bodies of third instar larvae. However, as shown in Fig. 7 A, Northern blotting detected 0.9 kilobase mRNA for granulocytin exclusively in hemocytes, not in the fat body, indicating that this lectin was synthesized by the hemocytes. Expression of the granulocytin gene was examined at various developmental stages of Sarcophaga. No significant expression was detected throughout the embryonic stage to the second instar larval stage, but this gene was expressed in third instar larvae and the expression continued until the early pupal stage. Then, this gene was turned off during the rest of the pupal stage and was activated again in the newly emerged adult flies (Fig. 7 B). We examined the post-injury acute-phase expression of the granulocytin gene in hemocytes from third instar larvae. As shown in Fig. 7 C, expression of this gene was enhanced 6 h after pricking the larval body wall with a thin needle and declined slightly 18 h later. These expression patterns were very similar to those of the Drosophila lectin gene (34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a novel C-type lectin ofSarcophaga and purified it from the membrane fraction of NIH-Sape-4 cells by SLB1-Sepharose chromatography. SLB1 is a monoclonal antibody against Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein with a molecular mass of 10 kDa (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As this novel lectin (granulocytin) clearly differed from the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein, SLB1 should have affinity for both the Sarcophagalectin-binding protein and granulocytin. The epitope for SLB1 in the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein may be a specific carbohydrate chain, which granulocytin may also contain. In which case, why was only granulocytin recovered from the SLB1-Sepharose column? Granulocytin content of NIH-Sape-4 cells is probably an order of magnitude higher than that of the Sarcophaga lectin-binding protein and, therefore, the former protein was trapped selectively by the column. We solubilized granulocytin from the membrane fraction of NIH-Sape-4 cells with octylglucoside as described before (22Nagasawa Y. Kurata S. Komano H. Natori S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1993; 35: 331-340Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As granulocytin turned out to be a soluble hemolymph protein, hemolymph would probably have been a better source for purification. We might have purified granulocytin contaminating the membrane fraction or the granules that store granulocytin might have been recovered in the membrane fraction we prepared. Indeed, we found that the latter is the case. The purified 20-kDa protein yielded a broad band after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sometimes yielded a doublet band. As the amino-terminal sequences of the proteins from these two bands were identical, their different electrophoretic mobilities were probably due to differences in their carbohydrate chains. Of the seven types of red cells tested, only those from rabbits were agglutinated by this lectin possibly because this lectin recognizes a specific sequence of carbohydrates present only in RRBC. Granulocytin appears to be the Sarcophaga counterpart ofDrosophila lectin because their molecular masses and gene expression patterns during development and expression during the acute-phase response to injury are very similar (34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the carbohydrate specificities of these two lectins are different. At present, the biological role of granulocytin is unknown. However, as it is synthesized prior to pupation, production of this lectin is probably prerequisite for metamorphosis. This lectin may play a role in self/nonself recognition by hemocytes during the initial stage of metamorphosis when larval tissue ingestion by hemocytes starts. Hemocytes have to recognize larval tissues as nonself to ingest them, and lectin is a good candidate for a modulator of self/nonself recognition by hemocytes. The Northern blotting analysis findings suggest that expression of the granulocytin gene is involved in the acute-phase response to injury, as is Drosophila lectin gene expression (34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These lectins may be involved in the defense systems that eliminate invading parasites as well as in the process that disintegrates unnecessary larval tissues during metamorphosis. Our results demonstrated clearly that granulocytin is synthesized exclusively by hemocytes. We detected a positive signal of granulocytin in the fat body by immunoblotting. This signal may have been due to hemocytes contaminating the fat body preparation. Five of the seven residues commonly found in the CRDs from various C-type lectins are conserved in the structure of the putative CRD of granulocytin. Of these seven residues, Glu, Asp, and Asn (see Fig. 5) were recently reported to be responsible for sugar and calcium binding (37Weis W.I. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 38Drickamer K. Nature. 1992; 360: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Although the CRD of Drosophila lectin contains these three residues (34Haq S. Kubo T. Kurata S. Kobayashi A. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), that of granulocytin contains only Asn. The hapten sugar of Drosophila lectin was identified as galactose, but we could not identify that of granulocytin because many sugars at relatively high concentrations inhibited the hemagglutinating activity of granulocytin. The deficiency of these two residues might explain the broad and weak carbohydrate specificity of granulocytin."

The three identified REG subunits, designated α, β, and γ, differ significantly in sequence over a short span of 15–30 amino acids that we call homolog-specific inserts. These inserts were deleted from each REG to produce the mutant proteins REGαΔi, REGβΔi, and REGγΔi. The purified recombinant proteins were then tested for their ability to oligomerize and activate the proteasome. Both REGαΔi and REGγΔi formed apparent heptamers and activated human red cell proteasomes to the same extent as their full-length counterparts. By contrast, REGβΔi exhibited, at low protein concentrations, reduced proteasome activation when compared with the wild-type REGβ protein. REGβΔi was able to form hetero-oligomers with a single site, monomeric REGα mutant and with REGαΔi. At low concentrations, the REGαΔi/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers stimulated the proteasome less than REGα/REGβ oligomers formed from wild-type subunits, and the reduced activation by REGαΔi/REGβΔi was due to removal of the REGβ insert, not the REGα insert. These studies demonstrate that the REGα and REGγ inserts play virtually no role in oligomerization or in proteasome activation. By contrast, removal of REGβ insert reduces binding of this subunit and REGα/REGβ oligomers to proteasomes. On the whole, however, our findings show that REG inserts are not required for binding and activating the proteasome. We speculate that they serve to localize REG-proteasome complexes within cells, possibly by binding components in endoplasmic reticulum membranes.

We call the divergent regions “homolog-specific inserts” or, for sake of discussion, simply inserts. Using random mutagenesis, we recently isolated 45 single-site REGα mutants with impaired ability to activate the proteasome; none of the 45 amino acid changes was found in the REGα insert (19Zhang Z Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, the REGα insert is a KEKE motif, which consists largely of “alternating” glutamate and lysine residues and which has been hypothesized to mediate protein-protein associations (20Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Hence, the apparent absence of single-site mutations in the REGα insert region could simply reflect redundant information within the insert (see Fig. 1 A). The crystal structure of REGα reveals that it is a heptameric ring with a conical pore measuring 20 Å in diameter on one face and 30 Å in diameter on the other (Ref. 21Knowlton J.R. Johnston S. Whitby F. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholarand Fig. 1 B). The 39 amino acids that encompass the insert region are disordered, and the seven inserts present in the assembled heptamer are located on the surface opposite the presumed proteasome binding face (21Knowlton J.R. Johnston S. Whitby F. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). One can calculate that even if these 39 amino acids were maximally condensed (i.e. globular), they could interact with each other (see Fig. 1 C). Furthermore, four proteasome α subunits possess long C-terminal extensions that are capable of interacting with REG inserts (see Fig. 1 D and Ref. 22Rechsteiner M. Hoffman L. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6065-6068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a description of the C-terminal extensions). Therefore, even though the REGα inserts appear to be some distance from the presumed proteasome binding surface, they could interact with each other and/or with proteasome α subunits. These interactions could, in turn, affect REG oligomerization or the ability of REG homologs to bind and/or activate the proteasome. To test these possibilities, we have deleted the inserts from each REG homolog and have characterized the three mutant proteins. At low concentrations, REGβ lacking its insert stimulates the proteasome less than wild-type REGβ and produces REGα/β hetero-oligomers that bind and activate the proteasome less efficiently than hetero-oligomers formed from wild-type REGα and REGβ subunits. However, the biochemical properties of REGα and REGγ insert deletion mutants demonstrate that the inserts are not required for oligomerization or activation of the proteasome by these two REG homologs.

To prepare REGα, REGβ, and REGγ single-strand DNAs containing uracil residues, each REG homolog cDNA was subcloned into the phagemid pET26b and used to transform CJ236 cells, which lack dUTPase and uracilN-glycosylase and thus allow incorporation of deoxyuridine into DNA. A helper phage strain VCS-M13 (Stratagene) was used to infect the CJ236 cells containing REGα, REGβ, or REGγ plasmids, and single-strand DNAs were isolated according to a standard protocol (23Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar,24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar). DNAs from selected clones were purified and sequenced. Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3) were grown at 30 °C overnight and induced for 2 h with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside when the A600 was between 0.2 and 0.3 or with 0.6 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside when the A600 was between 0.3 and 0.5. Lysates were prepared by resuspending the bacteria pellets in TSD (10 mmTris, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol), pH 8.8, with 1 μg/ml pepstatin A and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and passing the suspension through a French press. The lysates were then cleared by centrifugation and applied to an ion exchange column packed with diethylaminoethyl fast flow resin (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). All the recombinant proteins used in this study were purified to homogeneity using a combination of diethylaminoethyl chromatography and Superdex 200 gel filtration as described (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Z Clawson A.

Fractions from the sizing column were pooled, concentrated with a Centriprep 10, and dialyzed against 0.5 × TSD for at least 20 h prior to biochemical characterization. REGαΔi cDNA in pET26b was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into pET16b to produce (His)10-REGαΔi constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to insert Gly-Gly-(His)6 after the first N-terminal Met of REGγΔi. SDS-polyacrylamide gels consisted of a 4% stacking gel and a 15% resolving gel. Minigels prepared using a Mini-Protean apparatus were used to separate (His)10-REGαΔi from REGβΔi and REGα(N50Y), an inactive monomeric REGα mutant, from REGβΔi and to check protein purity. After gel electrophoresis, proteins were visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining or silver staining. To determine whether REGα and REGβ inserts affected their hetero-oligomerization, (His)10-REGαΔi instead of REGαΔi was used as REGαΔi could not be separated from REGβΔi by SDS-PAGE or HPLC. Bacteria expressing (His)10-REGαΔi and those expressing REGβΔi were combined together and resuspended in TBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl) plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). A French press was used to lyse the bacteria, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 1 h. The lysates were then incubated for 1 h with Ni-NTA beads equilibrated with TBS. After discarding the supernatants, the beads were washed three times with TBS plus protease inhibitors and three times with TBS and 25 mm imidazole plus protease inhibitors. The bound proteins were eluted with TBS, 0.5 m imidazole and applied to a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (see Fig. 4). To determine whether REGβΔi formed hetero-oligomers with REGγΔi, we used (His)6-REGγΔi and followed the same procedures described above; no interactions were observed between REGβΔi and REGγΔi under these conditions. Human red blood cell 20 S proteasomes (typically 170 ng) were incubated with various amounts of wild-type or insert-deleted REG at 37 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5). Enzymatic reactions were started by adding 50 μl of a 200 μm solution of fluorogenic peptide substrate. After further incubation as indicated in the figure legends, the reactions were quenched with 200 μl of ice-cold ethanol, and fluorescence was measured as described (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The experiment was performed by incubating peptide P21 (SADPELALALRVSME-EQRQRQ) or BBC1 (MKKEKARVITEEEKNFKAFASLRMARANARLFGIRAKRAKEAAEQDGSG) with REG homologs or deletion mutants and human red blood cell proteasomes as described (25Niedermann G.

The digested products were then separated on a C18 HPLC column using a gradient of 0–45% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Proteasome binding assays were performed as described (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, various amounts of REG homologs or hetero-oligomers were incubated with human red cell proteasomes tethered to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates by the monoclonal antibody MCP20. After washing away unbound REGs, the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.5, and dot-blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20, and bound REG proteins were detected with rabbit anti-REG followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and chemiluminescence. After REGα(N50Y)/REGβ and REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers were isolated from the Superdex 200 gel filtration column as described above, three fractions across each peak were applied to a C18 column separately, and a gradient of 30–70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used to separate REGα(N50Y) from REGβ or REGβΔi. The ratio of REGβ or REGβΔi to REGα(N50Y) was determined by the HPLC peak area computed by an HP ChemStation (version A. 04.01, Hewlett Packard) based on the absorbance at 214 nm. The area of each peak was divided by the molecular weight of the corresponding protein to produce a subunit molar ratio. The crystal structure of REGα reveals that the insert regions are disordered and located on the upper structure of a heptameric REGα ring, whereas the lower surface of the ring is the presumed proteasome binding face (Ref. 21Knowlton J.R. Johnston S. Whitby F. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, Fig. 1, B and C). To address the functions of the inserts, defined by the bold letters in Fig. 1 A, we used recombinant DNA techniques to delete them from each homolog (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutant proteins and their wild-type counterparts were expressed inE. coli and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 D). It was clear from the gel filtration step used during purification that the REGα insert deletion mutant (REGαΔi) and REGγ insert deletion mutant (REGγΔi) formed oligomers. Nonetheless, after purification, we directly compared the oligomerization state of each deletion mutant with its full-length counterpart. REGαΔi eluted from a Superdex 200 column at 183 ml, whereas wild-type REGα elutes at ∼175 ml (data not shown). REGγΔi proteins also eluted later than wild-type REGγ (180 mlversus 172 ml); REGβΔi eluted at 230 ml compared with 226 ml for wild-type REGβ. We attribute the slight reduction in the apparent hydrodynamic radius of REGαΔi and REGγΔi to removal of the 28 or 32 amino acids present in the inserts rather than to changes in the oligomerization state from a heptamer to, say, a hexamer. However, we cannot strictly exclude the latter possibility. Activation of the proteasome by each REGΔi was compared with the activation properties of its full-length counterpart. REGαΔi and REGγΔi stimulated the proteasome to the same extent as their full-length counterparts at all protein concentrations tested (Fig. 2, A and B). By contrast, REGβΔi activated the proteasome less than wild-type REGβ at low protein concentrations, although the degree of stimulation by each REGβ molecule was equivalent at high concentrations (Fig. 2 C, Table I). Because decreased activation by REGβΔi was observed using REGβ and REGβΔi proteins obtained in three independent purifications, we do not attribute the differences to denaturation or variabilities in a given purification (see also Fig. 5 for similar results with REGαΔi/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers at low protein concentrations).Table ISubstrate-specific stimulation of the proteasome by wild-type and insert-deleted REGsPeptideStimulation (x-fold)REGαREGαΔiREGβREGβΔiREGγREGγΔiFSR98121266PFR335434VLK556633LRR161519191013LLE161313811AAF1412141322LY557822LLVY3030283011 Open table in a new tab Figure 5Proteasome activation by α/β hetero-oligomers formed from subunits lacking inserts.

REGαΔi/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers were formed by mixing REGαΔi with an equal amount of REGβΔi, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C. REGα/REGβ was formed in the same way. The combinations were then used to assay for proteasome activation as described in Fig. 2. B, proteasome stimulation by REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi (open diamonds) and REGα(N50Y)/REGβ (closed diamonds). REGα(N50Y), a monomeric REGα mutant, was mixed with either REGβΔi or REGβ and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The resulting hetero-oligomers were purified using a Superdex 200 sizing column and assayed for proteasome activation as described in Fig. 2 except that reactions were incubated for 10 min after substrate addition.

The concentrations of REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi or REGα(N50Y)/REGβ hetero-oligomers indicated on the left were incubated with proteasomes tethered by antibodies to an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 0. 5m NaCl and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane; rabbit anti-REGα was used to probe the membrane. Chemiluminescence reagents from NEN were used to visualize bound horseradish peroxidase-goatversus rabbit antibodies. The box labeledC shows the signal obtained when 1 μm REGα was incubated in the wells coated with antibodies but in the absence of proteasomes. Each entry in panels A, B, and C represents the mean of three measurements from a single experiment. Similar results were obtained in at least two independent experiments using recombinant REG proteins from different preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) REGγ preferentially activates hydrolysis of fluorogenic peptides with positive residues adjacent to the fluorescent MCA leaving group (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). REGα and REGβ stimulate the proteasome to cleave after basic, acidic, or hydrophobic residues at the P1 position. Because the greatest sequence divergence between REGγ and REGα or REGβ is in the insert region, differential activation of specific peptide hydrolysis might result from interactions between REG inserts and the proteasome. This possibility was tested by measuring cleavage of various fluorogenic peptides in the presence of wild-type and insert-deleted REGs. There were no significant changes in peptide cleavage patterns activated by REGαΔi, REGβΔi, and REGγΔi and their corresponding wild-type counterparts (Table I). Therefore, the homolog-specific inserts do not account for the distinct patterns of activated peptide hydrolysis observed with REGγ, on one hand, and REGα or REGβ on the other. The longest fluorogenic peptide surveyed in Table Iconsists of four amino acids. Whether proteasome specificities revealed by short fluorogenic peptides are relevant to the enzyme's preference for natural peptide substrates has generated some debate (26Ustrell V. Realini C. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Groettrup M. Soza A. Kuckelhorn U. Kloetzel P.-M. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 429-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 28Tanaka K. Tanahashi N. Tsurumi C. Yokota K. Shimbara N. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 64: 1-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned, the crystal structure of REGα reveals that the insert lies on a surface opposite to the presumed proteasome binding face (21Knowlton J.R. Johnston S. Whitby F. Realini C. Zhang Z. Rechsteiner M. Hill C.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Its position suggests that REG inserts might bind natural peptide substrates and either promote or retard their entry into the proteasome's central chamber. If so, REG molecules lacking their inserts should exhibit altered ability to promote cleavage of long, natural peptides by the proteasome. To explore this possibility, we used a 21-residue peptide and a 49-residue peptide as proteasome substrates and analyzed the cleavage products in the presence of REGαΔi or wild-type REGα. It is evident from the HPLC profiles in Fig. 3 that there was no significant difference between REGαΔi and REGα in their ability to stimulate cleavage of two long peptides by the proteasome. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that removal of the REGα insert affects the rate at which the proteasome degrades the two substrates, P21 and BBC1. Nor can we exclude the possibility that removal of the REGα insert affects Km values for peptide hydrolysis by REG-proteasome complexes. REGα and REGβ preferentially form hetero-oligomers. By contrast, REGγ only forms homo-oligomers (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The REGα and REGβ inserts are similar, being composed largely of alternating lysine and glutamic acid residues, i.e. KEKE motifs. The REGγ insert, on the other hand, contains blocks of positive and negative amino acids sandwiched between two stretches of hydrophobic residues (see Fig. 1 A). Conceivably, the similar chemical nature of the REGα and REGβ inserts promotes preferential association of REGα with REGβ. If this were an important function of the REGα and REGβ inserts, hetero-oligomerization of insert-deleted subunits should be impaired. This possibility was tested by mixing (His)10-REGαΔi or (His)6-REGγΔi with REGβΔi and assaying hetero-oligomer formation by gel filtration. Bacteria that expressed REGβΔi were mixed with bacteria that expressed either (His)10-REGαΔi or (His)6-REGγΔi prior to lysis. After clearing the lysate, the His-tagged proteins were captured on Ni-NTA beads, eluted with 0.5 m imidazole, and applied to a Superdex 200 filtration column (Fig. 4, A and B). (His)10-REGαΔi formed active, stable hetero-oligomers with REGβΔi, whereas (His)6-REGγΔi did not (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that association of (His)10-REGαΔi with REGβΔi was due to the interactions between REGβΔi and the polyhistidine extension on REGαΔi, we used a REGα inactive monomeric mutant, REGα(N50Y), that forms hetero-oligomers with wild-type REGβ. 2Z. Zhang, A. Clawson, and M. Rechsteiner, manuscript in preparation. REGα(N50Y) was mixed with REGβΔi, and gel filtration revealed that the two proteins formed stable active hetero-oligomers (Fig. 4, Cand D). From these experiments, we conclude that the homolog-specific inserts do not determine the preferential association of REGα and REGβ. The formation of stable hetero-oligomers between REGαΔi and REGβΔi allowed us to measure the ability of this complex to activate the proteasome and compare it with activation by wild-type REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers. As shown in Fig. 5 A, higher concentrations of REGαΔi/REGβΔi were needed to activate the proteasome to the same extent as wild-type REGα/REGβ oligomers. Reduced proteasome activation at low concentrations of REGαΔi/REGβΔi might result from the lack of the REGα insert, the REGβ insert, or both. To distinguish among these possibilities, we measured proteasome activation by hetero-oligomers of REGα(N50Y)/REGβ or REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi and found that REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi produced less activation than REGα(N50Y)/REGβ at low concentrations (Fig. 5 B). By contrast, REGαΔi/REGβ activated the proteasome in a manner indistinguishable from REGα/REGβ (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, the reduced stimulation by REGαΔi/REGβΔi can be attributed to the absence of the REGβ insert, not the REGα insert. This result is consistent with the impaired ability of REGβΔi to stimulate the proteasome (Fig. 2 C). Apparently, the REGβ insert affects proteasome activation even in the REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomer. An explanation for the reduced activation by REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi is a lower affinity of the complex for the proteasome. This was tested using the direct proteasome binding assay described earlier (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The titration presented in Fig. 5 D demonstrates that REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi does not bind the proteasome as well as REGα(N50Y)/REGβ. We conclude that decreased proteasome activation by REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi reflects its impaired ability to bind the proteasome and that this lowered affinity is due to the absence of the REGβ insert. The reduced affinity of REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi for the proteasome could be due to changes in the subunit composition of the hetero-oligomers. Therefore, after isolation of REGα(N50Y)/REGβ and REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers from a Superdex 200 gel filtration column, the apparent ratio of REGβ to REGα was determined from the absorbance at 214 nm of each subunit peak after HPLC (see “Experimental Procedures”). Samples were taken from three fractions across the corresponding hetero-oligomer peaks, and the apparent molar ratios of REGβ to REGα(N50Y) ranged from 1.30 to 1.38, whereas the apparent molar ratios of REGβΔi to REGα(N50Y) ranged from 1.13 to 1.17. A ratio of 1.33 would be fully consistent with the REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomer being a heptamer composed of four REGβ and three REGα subunits. An average ratio of 1.15 observed for REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi cannot be explained by any integral combination of REGα and REGβ subunits in a defined hetero-oligomer. However, it is not certain that the absorbance at 214 nm depends only on the number of peptide bonds in each subunit. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the absorbance ratio of 1.15 arises from hetero-oligomers consisting of four REGβΔi and three REGα(N50Y). However, neither can we exclude the possibility that removal of the REGβ insert produces small changes in the relative abundance of REGα and REGβ subunits in a mixture of hetero-oligomers. The experiments presented above address four hypotheses regarding the functions of REG homolog-specific inserts. We previously hypothesized that KEKE motifs promote protein-protein association (20Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). More recently, we proposed that the KEKE motifs in REGα and REGβ might interact with KEKE motifs on the proteasome subunits C6 and C9 (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The geometric considerations presented in Fig. 1 D show that even though the KEKE inserts in REGα are located on the surface opposite to the presumed proteasome binding surface, they could still interact with C-terminal extensions on proteasome alpha subunits. Thus, it is reasonable to imagine that REG inserts might promote binding to the proteasome, and this constitutes the first hypothesis tested. Fig. 2, A and B, demonstrates that proteasome activation by REGα and REGγ deletion mutants are virtually identical to their wild-type counterparts, indicating that binding of REGα or REGγ to the proteasome is not impaired by removal of their corresponding inserts. Although REGα and REGγ inserts do not promote proteasome binding, several experiments show that the REGβ insert is important for binding to the proteasome. First, the results in Fig. 2 C demonstrate that, at low concentrations, REGβΔi stimulates the proteasome much less than wild-type REGβ. Likewise, low concentrations of REGαΔi/REGβΔi hetero-oligomers activate the proteasome to a lesser extent than REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers (Fig. 5 A). Impaired proteasome activation by REGαΔi/REGβΔi was due to removal of REGβ inserts because REGαΔi/REGβ hetero-oligomers stimulate the proteasome equally as well as REGα/REGβ do at all concentrations tested (Fig. 5 C). REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi, on the other hand, stimulates the proteasome less than REGα(N50Y)/REGβ at low concentrations (Fig. 5 B). Reduced proteasome activation by REGβΔi and REGαΔi/REGβΔi could reflect weaker binding to the proteasome; indeed, a direct proteasome binding assay revealed that REGα(N50Y)/REGβΔi binds less tightly than REGα(N50Y)/REGβ (Fig. 5 D). It is possible that the reduced activity of REGβΔi results from structural alterations in the subunit produced by removal of the insert. However, in view of the high degree of sequence homology surrounding the α, β, and γ inserts (Fig. 1 A), it seems unlikely that structural perturbations produced by deleting the inserts would be confined to the β subunit. For this reason, we favor the idea that the REGβ insert actively contributes to proteasome binding by this subunit and by hetero-oligomers containing this subunit. Still, we must admit that the reduced activation by REGβΔi and hetero-oligomers formed from REGβΔi can also be explained by subtle structural alterations of the REGβ subunit upon removal of its insert. The second hypothesis asked whether the inserts are responsible for the fact that REGα and REGβ activate cleavage of a variety of fluorogenic substrates, whereas REGγ mostly activates cleavage after basic amino acids (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The results presented in Table I show that the patterns of peptide cleavage are identical regardless of whether full-length REG homologs or their insert-deleted counterparts were used to activate the proteasome. It is clear, therefore, that the homolog-specific inserts do not determine the patterns of activated fluorogenic peptide cleavage by the proteasome. The unique pattern of activation by REGγ, as opposed to REGα and REGβ, may be defined by other region(s) in the molecules, e.g. C-terminal and/or N-terminal sequences. Future experiments in which these regions are exchanged between REGα and REGγ should provide answers to this question. The crystal structure of REGα reveals that the inserts surround a pore through the REGα heptamer (Fig. 1, B and C). Because of their location, the inserts could bind long peptides and promote entry of these substrates to the active sites of the proteasome. Alternatively, the inserts might prevent longer substrates from being degraded by blocking the pore of REGα or by directly binding longer peptides. These two possibilities constitute the third hypothesis tested. The HPLC profiles in Fig. 3 show that there are no significant differences in the ability of REGα and REGαΔi to stimulate the digestion of two long peptide substrates by the proteasome. However, we consistently observe that REGαΔi stimulates the proteasome slightly better than wild-type REGα using both Suc-LLVY-MCA and long peptides as substrates (Fig. 2 A, Fig. 3, and data not shown). Because the differences are within the experimental error, they may simply result from experimental variation. In any event, removal of the REGα insert produces, at most, a small effect on substrate degradation. The last hypothesis concerns the possibility that the inserts are responsible for the fact that REGα preferentially binds REGβ, and neither of these subunits binds REGγ (18Realini C. Jensen C.

The results presented in Fig. 4 clearly rule out a requirement for REGα and REGβ inserts in hetero-oligomer formation. While this manuscript was in review, a study from DeMartino's laboratory (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of the insert from rat REGα does not affect its activity, a finding that agrees with results presented here. However, Song et al. (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) found reduced activation by REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers formed from rat REGα molecules lacking inserts, whereas removal of the human REGα insert did not affect proteasome activation by REGα/REGβ (Fig. 5 C). Song et al. (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) speculate that decreased activation resulted from impaired interactions between REGα and REGβ upon removal of the REGα inserts. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the inserts facilitate association of these two subunits, they are clearly not required for human REGα to oligomerize with REGβ (see Fig. 4). Song et al. (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) also reported that recombinant rat REGβ is inactive. The results presented here (Fig. 2 C and Table I) show that recombinant human REGβ stimulates the proteasome. Two other studies from our laboratory have shown that human REGβ is active (18Realini C. Jensen C. Zhang Z. Johnston S. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25483-25492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Zhang Z Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, a single-site mutation in the activation region of REGβ results in loss of this activity (19Zhang Z Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we do not believe that the activity observed for human REGβ is an experimental artifact. The discrepancy between our findings and those of Song et al. (29Song X. von Kampen J. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27994-28000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) could reflect differing properties of rat and human REGβ molecules or differences in assay conditions. Regarding the latter possibility, we note that the assay of Song et al. uses REGβ concentrations 10-fold lower than those employed by us. In summary, the results presented above clearly demonstrate that the presence of REGβ inserts increases the affinity of REGβ and REGα/REGβ hetero-oligomers for the proteasome. By contrast, REGα and REGγ inserts are not required for proteasome binding or activation. We have also demonstrated that the REGα, REGβ, and REGγ inserts are not responsible for their differing abilities to activate cleavage of specific fluorogenic peptides, nor do the inserts define the specific patterns of homo-oligomerization and/or the hetero-oligomerization observed with these three homologs. In addition, removal of the REGα inserts did not have any pronounced effect on the extent of the degradation of long peptides. If the REGα and REGγ inserts are not important for activating the proteasome, what do they do? Although it is possible that they have no biological functions, the high degree of conservation observed among each homolog-specific insert from several mammalian species would suggest otherwise. Possibly, the inserts have some regulatory function. For example, REGγ has been reported to disappear upon interferon-γ treatment (30Tanahashi N. Yokota K. Ahn J.Y. Chung C. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Demartino G.N. Slaughter C.A. Toyonaga T. Yamamura K. Shimbara N. Tanaka K. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 195-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the REGγ insert harbors a degradation signal. As for REGα and REGβ, we have observed that KEKE motifs are found in chaperonins such as hsp90 and hsp70 (20Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the KEKE insert of REGα may bind heat shock proteins. Alternatively, we have proposed that the inserts serve to couple the proteasome to the calnexin-TAP-MHC I complexes in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby promoting transfer of antigenic peptides to MHC I molecules (20Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The availability of insert-deleted forms of each REG homolog should allow direct tests of the latter hypothesis. We thank Robert Schackmann for oligonucleotide synthesis. We are also grateful to Drs. Carlos Gorbea, Patrick Young, Vicenca Ustrell, David Mahaffey, Laura Hoffman, and Daniel Taillandier for comments on the manuscript and to other members of the Rechsteiner laboratory for technical advice."

Although strand passage and DNA-dependent ATPase activities are affected in these mutant proteins, their DNA cleavage activity is comparable with the wild-type enzyme and can be stimulated to the same level by topoisomerase-targeting anticancer drugs. The sequence specificity in the DNA cleavage reaction remains unaltered for the mutant proteins. We have used both glass fiber filter binding assay and CsCl density gradient ultracentrifugation to monitor the formation of a salt-stable, protein-clamp complex. Both Gln and Glu mutant proteins can form a clamp complex in the presence of 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate, albeit with a lower efficiency than the wild-type enzyme. However, the mutant proteins can form a stable complex either in the presence of ATP or in the absence of any cofactors. These results are in an interesting contrast with the wild-type enzyme, which cannot form a stable complex under similar conditions.

Our data suggest that Lys359 is critical for the catalytic activity of topoisomerase II and may have an important function in the ATP signaling process. Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that have critical functions in many aspects of DNA metabolism, including replication, transcription, recombination, and genome stability (reviewed in Ref. 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). It is dimeric in structure and can pass DNA through a transient DNA gate generated by reversible transesterification from a pair of active site tyrosine residues. In vitro, topoisomerase II (topo II) 1The abbreviations used are: topo, topoisomerase; gyrB, DNA gyrase B protein; gyrA, DNA gyrase A protein; AMPPNP, 5′-adenylylβ,γ-imidodiphosphate. catalyzes the reaction of DNA supercoiling and relaxation, catenation/decatenation, and knotting and unknotting of DNA rings. In vivo, the essential biological functions of topo II are in the segregation of replicated and topologically interlocked chromosomes (Ref. 2Ishida R. Sato M. Narita T. Utsumi K.R. Nishimoto T. Morita T. Nagata H. Andoh T. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 126: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar; also reviewed in Ref. 3Yanagida M. Wang J.C. Eckstein F. Lilley D.M.J. Nucleic Acids and Molecular Biology. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1987: 196-209Google Scholar). Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic topo II share very similar biochemical mechanisms and are related by strong sequence homologies (4Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29: 271-297Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The N-terminal and central domains of the eukaryotic topo II subunit are homologous to the bacterial gyrB and gyrA subunits, respectively. Recent high-resolution structural data suggest that the sequence homology between eukaryotic and bacterial topo II can be translated into structural similarity (5Berger J.M. Gamblin S.J. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, 6Morais Cabral J.H. Jackson A. Smith C.V. Shikotra N. Maxwell A. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 903-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism of topo II in freely passing DNA helices through each other is no less complicated than those described for other macromolecular machineries. The reaction starts with the binding of a DNA segment to the enzyme surface at the active site tyrosines. This stretch of DNA will serve as a protein-mediated gate and is termed the G segment. Upon the binding of ATP, a second segment of DNA is captured by the closure of the topo II N-terminal protein clamp, known as the N-gate (7Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), and transported through the G segment. The binding of ATP to eukaryotic topo II also induces an allosteric change in the N-terminal domain in concert with the clamp closure (8Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10485-10489Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After the passage of DNA through the reversible break in the G segment, the transported DNA helix is held and then expelled from the enzyme through the C-terminal protein clamp, known as the C-gate, formed by the gyrA homologous domain (10Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 11Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ATP in this reaction allows the turnover of the catalytic cycle (12Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5960-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 13Sugino A. Higgins N.P. Brown P.O. Peebles C.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 14Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although ATP binding can trigger the closure of N-gate, its role in other steps of the catalytic cycle, such as the strand passage and exit of DNA from the C-gate, remains to be delineated. Furthermore, the topoisomer distribution in the topo II-catalyzed reactions including supercoil relaxation, catenation, and knotting is apparently below the equilibrium position (15Rybenkov V.V. Ullsperger C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1997; 277: 690-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It is likely that the free energy from the hydrolysis of ATP concomitant with topo II-mediated strand passage reactions is the driving force to bias the chemical equilibrium. How this is achieved in biochemical and mechanistic terms is yet to be determined. We are interested in identifying important residues in the ATP-dependent reactions of topo II and analyzing the biochemical consequences of mutations at these residues. Such information provides insight into the mechanism of topo II reactions and guides the future experiments to test various hypotheses. We report here the result from site-specific mutagenesis of a conserved Lys359 that is situated in close proximity to the γ-phosphate of bound ATP. Although the double strand DNA cleavage reaction is not affected by the mutations tested, Lys359mutants have greatly reduced catalytic activities and have altered clamp closure response with respect to ATP cofactors. Thus, Lys359 is implicated in the ATP-triggered reactions of topo II. The expression ofDrosophila topo II was driven by the GAL1promoter in a YEp24-based yeast vector (16Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the method described by Kunkel (17Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Three 21-mer oligonucleotides, covering the top2 cDNA nucleotides 1325–1345, contain sequence variations of AGG (Arg mutant), GAG (Glu mutant), and CAG (Gln mutant) in place for the original Lys359 codon AAG. DNA sequences were determined surrounding the mutagenic site to confirm that only the desired mutation was introduced. Complementation of yeasttop2 ts alleles by Drosophila top2 was carried out as described (16Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The growth of yeast cells at a nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C in medium containing galactose demonstrated the expression of a functional Drosophila top2. The color sectoring assay was performed to test the ability of wild-type and mutant Drosophila top2 to complement a yeasttop2 null mutation (18Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The formation of red/white sectored colony indicated that a Drosophila topo II construct was functional and could replace the only functional yeast TOP2on the plasmid (19Kranz J.E. Holm C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6629-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Drosophila topo II was overexpressed in yeast BCY123 (pep4 −, prb1 −,bar1 −, lys2::GAL1-GAL4, ura3 −; a generous gift from Dr. Janet Lindsley, University of Utah). The expression of Drosophila top2 constructs were induced in YEP medium containing 2% galactose. An 8-liter culture of yeast cells overproducing Drosophila topo II was harvested and lysed as described in Ref. 20Crenshaw D.G. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21335-21343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a 100-ml of Bio-Rex 70 (Bio-Rad) column. The column was eluted by a NaCl gradient in Buffer P (15 mmNaDi, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% Glycerol), with topo II coming off at 0.5 m NaCl. The active fractions were then pooled, diluted 1:1 with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and loaded onto a 7.8-ml Poros HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The column was eluted by a NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and topo II was eluted at 0.8m NaCl. The peak fractions were combined, diluted 4-fold with 50 mm NaPi (pH 8.0), and loaded onto a 1.7-ml heparin column (Poros HE, PerSeptive Biosystems). The Poros HE column was eluted by a NaCl gradient in 10 mmNaPi (pH 8.0). The peak fractions eluted at 0.3m NaCl were then pooled and dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 15 mm NaPi, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaCl, and 50% glycerol for 16 h. 0.1 mm of dithiotreitol and a mixture of protease inhibitors including 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A were included in all solutions used in the purification procedures. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie dye-binding assay (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar), and purification at each step was monitored by SDS-PAGE (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). A 40-μl reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 nm of pCaSpeRhs83 DNA (circular or linearized), and 75 nm of topo II proteins was incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. Some reactions also included 0.5 mm of a nucleoside triphosphate cofactor (ATP or AMPPNP). The reaction was terminated by adding a chilled mixture of 330 μl of saturated CsCl solution and 107 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to make the final density of the solution 1.65 g/ml. The mixture was spun at 40,000 rpm in an analytical ultracentrifuge (XL-A ultracentrifuge, Beckman Instruments) at 20 °C for 36 h before scanning the DNA concentrations across the gradient at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm. The density difference between protein/DNA complex and DNA was used to calculate the protein molecular weight in the salt-stable complex (23Depew R.E. Liu L.F. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 511-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plot of (1/ρc-n − 1/ρd)/(1/ρp − 1/ρc-n)·MWd versus n produced a straight line with slope MWp, the molecular weight of protein moiety in the complex. In this equation, n is the number of protein molecules bound in the complexes, MWd is the DNA molecular weight, and ρp, ρd, and ρc-n are the buoyant densities of protein, DNA, and a complex of DNA bound withn protein molecules, respectively. Topo II strand passage activities were tested by the unknotting of P4 knotted DNA, supercoiled relaxation, catenation, and decatenation assays as described in (24Hsieh T.-s. Wu R. Grossman L. Moldave K. Methods in Enzymology. 100. Academic Press, New York1983: 161-170Google Scholar). ATPase assay was done as described in Ref. 25Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar except that a 8.6-kilobase plasmid DNA, pCaSpeRhs83 (26Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1408-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), was used, and the radioactivities were quantified by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Topo II-mediated double-stranded DNA cleavage was carried out using plasmid DNA substrate as described in (27Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The uniquely end-labeled DNA containing the intergenic region of heat shock gene HSP70was used to map the topo II cleavage sites as described earlier (28Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein-mediated binding of DNA to GF/C glass fiber filters (29Thomas Jr., C.A. Saigo K. McLeod E. Ito J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was done as described by Roca and Wang (7Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled DNA substrate used in the filter binding assays was generated by nick translation of nicked pHC 624 (30Boros I. Posfai G. Venetianer P. Gene. 1984; 30: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) carried out in the presence of [α-32P]TTP (0.5 Ci/mmol) for 1 h followed by religation with T4 DNA ligase in the presence of 5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 3 h. The mixture was then phenol extracted and run through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the unincorporated nucleotides. Half of the labeled DNA sample was linearized by the restriction enzyme EcoRI. An equal mixture of linear and circular DNA samples was used in each assay. The x-ray crystal structure of the 43-kDa N-terminal fragment of gyrB protein reveals a two-domain structure: the N-terminal half (residues 2–220) is the ATP-binding moiety and the C-terminal half (residues 221–392) forms a 20-Å cavity (31Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Examining the cavity-forming domain shows that a loop with a sequence of QTK (residues 335–337) extends away from the rest of the domain and is in close contact with γ-phosphate of the bound ATP analog (Ref. 31Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 A). The N—O distance between the ε-amino group in Lys337 and γ-phosphate in ATP is 2.6 Å, suggesting that either hydrogen bonding or ionic interaction could exist between them. It is also interesting to note that QTK and the sequence surrounding it are highly conserved among topo II (Fig. 1 B). To test the importance of the lysine residue in the QTK loop in topo II reactions, we generated site-specific mutations converting lysine to arginine, glutamine, and glutamate (see “Experimental Procedures”). The homologous residue of Lys337 of gyrB is Lys359 in Drosophila enzyme (Fig. 1 B). The activity of the site-specific mutants was first tested by genetic complementation assays that were based on our previous observation that a functional Drosophila top2 gene could rescue either a conditional yeast top2 mutation (16Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or a null mutation (18Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In these in vivo functional assays, the K359R mutant is active but K359Q and K359E are not (data not shown). These results are also confirmed by the topoisomerase assays in which the crude extracts yeast cells expressing K359R are active, whereas those expressing K359Q and K359E are inactive (data not shown). Therefore, both in vivo and in vitro assays suggest that lysine is critical for topoisomerase functions; a homologous substitution with arginine does not significantly alter topoisomerase activities, and mutations converting it into glutamine and glutamate result in a loss of its activities. To analyze the effects of substitutions of Lys359, we have purified wild-type topo II and K359Q and K359E mutant proteins from overproducing yeast cells. The cleared extracts were fractionated on a cation-exchange column (BioRex-70), followed by anion exchanger chromatography (Poros HQ), and affinity chromatography (Poros HE). Wild-type and mutant proteins all had identical elution profiles in these chromatographic steps (see “Experimental Procedures”) and were purified to over 90% homogeneity (Fig. 2). The DNA strand passage activity of these proteins were determined by the P4 DNA unknotting assays (Fig. 3). Two-fold serial dilutions in the linear range of activity were assayed for each protein. With 3.2 fmol of wild-type protein, P4 DNA could be completely unknotted (Fig. 3, lane 2). This corresponds to a specific activity of about 106 units/mg, which is the same as topo II purified from Drosophila cells (25Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even with the highest amount of mutant proteins tested here, about 500-fold more than the wild-type enzyme, the unknotting reaction was only about 50 and 10%, respectively, in completion (Fig. 3, lanes 7and 11). Other strand passage assays including supercoil relaxation, catenation, and decatenation of circular DNA produced similar results (data not shown). Furthermore, the unknotting activity is ATP-dependent; no unknotting was observed for wild-type and mutant proteins at the highest concentrations used in these assays in the absence of ATP (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 6, and 10). Other strand passage assays are also ATP-dependent (data not shown). Therefore, substitution of Lys359 with a neutral residue (K359Q) has resulted in 103-fold reduction in topoisomerase activity, whereas its substitution with a negatively charged residue (K359E) further lowers the enzymatic activity. In parallel with the greatly reduced topoisomerase activity, K359Q and K359E also lost most of their ATPase activity (Fig. 4). The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of glutamine and glutamate mutants dropped to 5.9 and 4.0%, respectively, of the wild-type enzyme activity (Fig. 4, solid columns). Most of these residual ATPase activities in the mutant proteins can be attributed to the DNA-independent activities, which are not significantly altered among the topo II proteins tested here (Fig. 4, shaded columns). This DNA-independent ATPase activity is likely intrinsic to topoisomerase proteins rather than from a contaminating ATPase. We tested the sensitivity of ATPase activity toward two topo II-targeting, antitumor drugs: ICRF159 and teniposide (VM26). ICRF159 and other drugs in the family of bisdioxopiperazine inhibit the catalytic activities of topo II (32Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar) and can promote the clamp formation of yeast topo II (33Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Bisdioxopierazines can also inhibit the ATPase activity of yeast topo II (33Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In the presence of ICRF159, the DNA-independent ATPase activity was reduced by 50% (Fig. 4, hatched versus shaded columns), a level of inhibition similar to that observed for yeast topo II. The same level of inhibition by ICRF159 was also demonstrated for K359Q and K359E mutant proteins (Fig. 4, hatched versus shaded columns). A second topo II inhibitor, teniposide, can promote the formation of the DNA cleavage complex of eukaryotic topo II (reviewed in Refs. 34Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar and 35Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 36Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it can inhibit the ATPase activities in the mutant protein to a similar extent as ICRF159 (data not shown). In addition to DNA strand passage and hydrolysis of ATP, another hallmark reaction of topo II is the double strand DNA cleavage. In this reaction, the addition of a strong denaturant traps the formation of a DNA cleavage complex in which the active site tyrosine of topo II is covalently linked to the phosphoryl end at DNA cleavage site. We used a 8.6-kilobase pair plasmid DNA, pCaSpeRhs83, as the substrate, and the cleavage reaction was monitored by the appearance of linear DNA fragments (Fig. 5). In contrast to topoisomerase and ATPase activities, the double strand DNA cleavage in the absence of any cofactors is comparable for all three proteins (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). Although ATP stimulates the DNA cleavage by wild-type and K359Q proteins, it only has a marginal effect on K359E protein (Fig. 5, lanes 10–12). The ATP-stimulatory effect appears to correlate with the ATP-dependent strand passage activity in these mutant proteins. A unique feature in the DNA cleavage reaction mediated by topoisomerase is that it can be stimulated by a number of antitumor agents (reviewed in Refs. 34Froelich-Ammon S.J. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21429-21432Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar and 35Chen A.Y. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1994; 34: 191-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of antitumor drugs on the cleavage by mutant proteins, we have used representatives from two distinct classes of topo II-targeting agents: amsacrine (mAMSA) and teniposide of epipodophyllotoxin (VM26) (36Chen G.L. Yang L. Rowe T.C. Halligan B.D. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13560-13566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Nelson E.M. Tewey K.M. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1361-1365Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They differ by their ability to intercalate into DNA. Although mAMSA can inhibit the strand passage step of topo II, another member of epipodophyllotoxin drugs, etoposide, does not affect this step in the topo II reaction (38Corbett A.H. Hong D. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14394-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, VM26 at a concentration of 1 μm can stimulate the DNA cleavage by all three proteins to identical levels (Fig. 5, lanes 7–9). mAMSA at the same concentration also affects the DNA cleavage to a similar degree (Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). The presence of ATP greatly stimulates the drug-promoted DNA cleavage, as evidenced by the nearly quantitative conversion of plasmid DNA into full-length linear molecules and smaller fragments, by wild-type and glutamine mutant proteins (Fig. 5, lanes 13and 16 and lanes 14 and 17, respectively). For the glutamate mutant, the ATP stimulatory effect is negligible (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 18). Despite the greatly reduced catalytic activities for Lys359 mutants, these mutations do not affect the formation of DNA cleavable complexes and also do not interfere with the interaction of topo II-targeting drugs. However, depending on the lysine substitutions, the effects of ATP cofactor in these reactions are variable. The DNA cleavage reaction has been used to assess the sequence preference in the topo II/DNA interactions (39Udvardy A. Schedl P. Sander M. Hsieh T.-s. Cell. 1985; 40: 933-941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Yang L. Rowe T.C. Nelson E.M. Liu L.F. Cell. 1985; 41: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 41Riou J.F. Multon E. Vilarem M.J. Larsen C.J. Riou G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 137: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previously, we have used DNA cleavage and nuclease footprinting to demonstrate the coincidence of topo II cleavage and binding sites in the intergenic region of a heat shock gene HSP70 (28Lee M.P. Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21779-21787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this study, we prepared a similar end-labeled DNA substrate to map the DNA cleavage sites for wild-type and mutant proteins (Fig. 6). Without any added cofactors, identical DNA cleavage patterns were observed for all three proteins, and the relative intensities at different cleavage sites are consistent with earlier data (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). The strongest cleavages occur in sites marked as T4–T6, which contain tracks of alternating purine/pyrimidine sequences. Addition of teniposide, VM26, greatly stimulates the cleavage by topo II and mutant proteins to a similar extent, except for site T3, where cleavage is enhanced to a lesser degree with mutant proteins (Fig. 6, lanes 4–6). We have tested the stimulation of topo II-mediated, double-strand DNA cleavage by VM26 at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 25 μm. At higher concentrations, the drug stimulated DNA cleavage to a higher extent, and the degree of such stimulation was similar for both the wild-type and mutant proteins (data not shown). Under these conditions of DNA cleavage, most of the DNA substrate remained uncleaved, and the cleavage was correlated with the amount of topo II protein present in the reaction (data not shown). The data from DNA cleavage experiments using either the plasmid or the end-labeled DNA substrate demonstrate that Lys359 mutations do not affect DNA cleavage reactions of topo II and do not alter the sequence specificity in their interactions with DNA substrate. Recent structural and biochemical data suggest a two-gate model for DNA transport by topo II (7Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 10Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 11Roca J. Berger J.M. Harrison S.C. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4057-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). A key element in this proposed mechanism is that the jaws of the N-gate are closed upon the binding of ATP and are open when ATP is hydrolyzed and dissociated. We have used a glass fiber filter binding assay (7Roca J. Wang J.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 833-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar,29Thomas Jr., C.A. Saigo K. McLeod E. Ito J. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to test the retention of circular versus linear DNA by topo II proteins. An equal-weight mixture of negatively supercoiled and linear DNA was used in these binding assays. The results obtained with the wild-type protein have demonstrated that the formation of a salt-stable complex with circular DNA is only observed in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP, and the linear molecules were found almost exclusively in the high-salt eluate (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8). In the absence of any cofactors, there was no filter-retainable, salt-stable complex (Fig. 7, lane 4). The total absence of filter-retainable complex in the presence of ATP (Fig. 7, lane 6) is presumably due to the continuing hydrolysis of ATP and opening of the protein clamp. In an interesting contrast, for K359Q and K359E mutants, clamp complex formation is detectable in the conditions of no cofactors or with ATP (Fig. 7, lanes 10 and 12 and lanes 16 and 18, respectively). The inclusion of AMPPNP stimulates the clamp complex formation for K359Q (Fig. 7, lane 14), but it has no effect for K359E (Fig. 7, lane 20). The efficiency of the clamp complex formation with the mutant proteins under the conditions tested here is always lower than that for the wild-type protein in the presence of ATP analog, suggesting that Lys359 is critical for the clamp closure reaction. The mutant protein with glutamate substitution is less efficient in the clamp complex formation than that of the glutamine mutant. Furthermore, the formation of clamp complex either without any cofactor or with ATP suggests that Lys359 may be involved in the pathway for ATP-induced closure of N-gate, and its substitutions with other residues result in an anomaly in this signaling process.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes has shown that it consists of at least two core subunits of 125 and 50 kDa. The hallmarks of this polymerase are that it has an intrinsic 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, distinguishing it from pol α and pol β. The 125-kDa subunit of human pol δ (p125) has been identified as the catalytic subunit (4Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Toomey N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol δ is a member of a family of DNA polymerases which includes DNA polymerase α, pol ε, the herpesvirus DNA polymerases, and bacteriophage T4 polymerase (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Wang T.S.-F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Examination of the regions of conserved sequence has led to the identification of domains that are potentially required for DNA interaction, deoxynucleotide interaction, as well as the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of pol δ (7Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several regions in the NH2 and COOH termini which are conserved among human pol δ, yeast pol δ, and yeast and human pol ε (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Studies of the replication of SV40 DNA in vitro have led to the identification of a number of accessory proteins, which, together with pol δ, are required for the formation of a replication complex at the replication fork. These include PCNA, which functions as a sliding clamp and enhances the processivity of pol δ, consistent with its role as the leading strand polymerase (8Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M.J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although there have been some mutagenesis studies of the yeast pol δ (9Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), little has been done with human or mammalian pol δ, largely because of the lack of a suitable expression system. To facilitate structure-function studies of pol δ, it is desirable to have an expression system for the production of the recombinant protein. The expression of the human pol δ catalytic subunit has been achieved in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus vector (10Zhang P. Frugulhetti I. Jiang Y. Holt G.L. Condit R.C. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7993-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study we report the expression of p125 in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector as well as methods for separating the recombinant protein from endogenous DNA polymerases in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Deletion mutants of p125 were also characterized to investigate the domain structure of pol δ. In addition, we have obtained novel evidence that pol δ p125 is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-cyclin complexes and also can be coimmunoprecipitated with cdk2 when they are coexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. The interaction of pol δ with the cyclins and cdks was also confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments in Molt 4 cells. Preliminary experiments showed that phosphorylation has moderate or little effect on the activity of the catalytic subunit.DISCUSSIONThe studies reported here show that the catalytic subunit of DNA pol δ can be expressed in Sf9 cells in an active form and can be isolated by a conventional purification protocol or by an immunoaffinity chromatography procedure. Isolation of the recombinant protein was aided by the use of antibodies against pol δ which did not cross-react with the endogenous DNA polymerase in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. We took advantage of an immunoaffinity chromatography procedure to purify the recombinant pol δ in a facile manner and to ascertain that it was separated from any endogenous DNA polymerases. The properties of the overexpressed p125 catalytic subunit were compared with those of the native enzyme. Assays of the enzyme activity using poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as a template showed that the specific activities of the preparations were only about 1,200 units/mg (Table I) compared with about 25,000 units/mg protein for the calf thymus holoenzyme (14Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This difference is likely the result of the lack of, or of a greatly attenuated response to PCNA by the free catalytic subunit. Other studies of pol δ preparations containing only the catalytic subunit have suggested that it is not PCNA-responsive (18Goulian M. Herrmann S.M. Sackett J.W. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16402-16411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chiang C.S. Mitsis P.G. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9105-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas our previous studies of recombinant pol δ expressed in vaccinia virus have indicated a weak response (2–3-fold stimulation). The baculovirus-expressed pol δ shows little or no response to PCNA, whereas the response is restored by the presence of the p50 subunit (20Zhou J.Q. Tan C.K. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29740-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13013-13018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In other aspects, the enzymatic behavior of the recombinant p125 is very similar to that of the holoenzyme.Studies of deletion mutants show that deletions (amino acids 2–249 or 186–321) in the NH2 terminus retain polymerase activity. Deletions in the core region (amino acids 336–715) and the deletion of regions C and V in the core as well as most of the COOH-terminal region including the zinc finger motifs (778–1047) had no assayable activity (Table II). This is consistent with numerous other studies that indicate that the core region of this family of polymerases is involved in the binding of the incoming dNTP substrate (23Dong Q. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21563-21570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Dong Q. Copeland W.C. Wang T.S.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24163-24174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contains the catalytic center for DNA polymerase activity. The retention of enzymatic activity by the NH2-terminal deletion mutants is consistent with the existence of a domain structure in which the NH2-terminal region does not function in catalysis. That this is likely is also consistent with the structure of T4 polymerase, which contains most of the conserved core but only part of the NH2-terminal region that includes a motif required for the exonuclease activity (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The present studies provide the first evidence that the catalytic subunit of pol δ is itself a substrate for cyclin-dependent protein kinases and that this is specific for the G1 cdk-cyclins because other cdk-cyclin combinations were less effective in phosphorylating pol δ when they were coexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. Although the in vivo kinase activity of cdk-cyclin overexpressed in Sf9 insect cells may not reflect actual cellular events in the mammalian cell cycle, the involvement of G1 phase cdk-cyclins is consistent with our previous observations that pol δ is phosphorylated in vivo during the cell cycle and is maximal near the G1/S transition (25Zeng X.R. Hao H. Jiang H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24027-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The primary structure of pol δ shows a number of potential phosphorylation sites for the cdks, including six sites possessing the (S/T)P motif: serines 207 and 788 and threonines 83, 150, 238, and 640 (25Zeng X.R. Hao H. Jiang H. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24027-24033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that in mammalian cells the key regulators of the transition from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle include the G1cyclins-three D type cyclins (D1, D2, D3) and cyclin E (26Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Cyclin E expression is periodic, peaks at the G1/S transition, and regulates S phase commitment together with its catalytic subunit cdk2. Unlike cyclin E, expression of D type cyclins is cell lineage-specific and highly mitogen-dependent, rising on growth factor stimulation and declining rapidly on growth factor withdrawal (27Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 28Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). The current model for G1 cdk-cyclin functions is that cyclin D binds directly to the tumor suppressor gene product pRb, targeting cdk4 to its substrate, and resulting in phosphorylation of pRb during middle to late G1 phase. This reverses the growth-suppressive effects of pRb by releasing transcriptional factor E2F from its inhibitory constraint; the untethered E2F factor is then able to activate a series of genes required for DNA replication (26Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). The G1 cdk-cyclins are also thought to phosphorylate other key substrates resident at the DNA replication origin to trigger the actual onset of DNA replication once cells pass the restriction point (29D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.R. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 30Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Pol δ is the central enzyme in eukaryotic DNA replication and is tethered to DNA by a direct interaction with the PCNA clamp, which converts pol δ from a distributive into a highly processive enzyme for DNA synthesis (31Hurwitz J. Dean F.B. Kwong A.D. Lee S.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18043-18046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Herendeen R.H. Kelly T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding that pol δ is a substrate for the G1 cdk-cyclins is of significance as it provides a potential linkage for the cell cycle control of DNA synthesis. However, our studies do not reveal any major effects of phosphorylation on the activity of the p125 catalytic subunit, and only small increases (<2-fold) were observed after co-expression with cdk-cyclins (Table III). Pol α-primase has also been shown to be phosphorylated, and phosphorylation does not or only moderately changes its enzymatic properties (33Nasheuer H.-P. Moore A. Wahl A.F. Wang T.S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7893-7903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Podust V. Bialek G. Sternbach H. Grosse F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 35Prussak C.E. Tseng B.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commum. 1989; 159: 1397-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, the ability of pol α-primase to initiate SV40 DNA replication in vitro was found to be inhibited markedly after phosphorylation by cyclin A-dependent kinases (36Voitenleitner C. Fanning E. Nasheuer H.-P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Examination of the interaction of cdk2 with the deletion mutants of pol δ showed that the tertiary structure of pol δ is not required for this interaction and that the binding region is located in the NH2-terminal 249 residues of pol δ. The NH2-terminus of yeast and mammalian pol δ harbors several highly conserved regions (N1–N5) that are also present in herpes and Epstein-Barr viral polymerases (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These conserved regions are likely protein-protein interaction sites for pol δ (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The binding site of pol δ for PCNA has been mapped to the N2 region (13Zhang S.J. Zeng X.R. Zhang P. Toomey N.L. Chuang R.Y. Chang L.S. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7988-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The data presented also provide the first evidence for complexes that involve pol δ and the cdk-cyclins. The targeting of the cdks to a substrate has some precedence since the G1 cdk-cyclins are known to form complexes with pRb. The obvious question is whether this has any functional physiological significance in relation to the phosphorylation or regulation of pol δ. The present findings show that the interaction of pol δ with cdk2 and cdk4 needs to be investigated further, in addition to the issue of the cellular role of phosphorylation of pol δ by the cdk-cyclins.There are many levels at which phosphorylation could affect pol δ function other than the simple modulation of enzyme activity in a simple assay. This is apparent because physiologically pol δ is part of a holoenzyme and part of an extended multiprotein complex. Current findings that p21, a potent inhibitor of G1 cdks, and pol δ compete for the same sites in the interdomain connector loop of PCNA (37Zhang P. Sun Y. Hsu H. Zhang L. Zhang Y. Lee M.Y.W.T. J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1572-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) observed that PCNA is in a quaternary complex that includes cyclin D, cyclin-dependent kinases (cdk2, cdk4, cdk5), and p21. No phosphorylation of PCNA and p21 was detected, suggesting that neither of them is the primary substrate of phosphorylation. Thus, there are many possible permutations and speculations possible as to how regulatory systems could emerge from this melange of potential complexes. We have obtained preliminary evidence that pol δ is a substrate for the cyclin-dependent protein kinases. This was shown by the coexpression of baculovirus vectors for pol δ with several different cdk-cyclin combinations in Sf9 cells (Fig. 10) and coimmunoprecipitation Western blot studies in Molt 4 cells (Fig. 12). These results suggest that more than one cyclin might regulate pol δ, possibly triggering its phosphorylation at different sites or times of the cell cycle. Coimmunoprecipitation of pol δ deletion mutants with cdk2 also established the site of interaction (Fig. 11). Although the regulation of pol δ by protein phosphorylation has yet to be demonstrated firmly, this possibility provides a potential mechanism that might provide for the temporal regulation of DNA synthesis in concert with the cell cycle.Although the present evidence indicates that the phosphorylation status of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase δ may have no significant effect on its activity, the question of whether phosphorylation has any physiological relevance in affecting or regulating the biological function of polymerase δ still needs to be answered. A role of phosphorylation or binding of the kinase in affecting the properties of the polymerase in vivo in modulating the function of pol δ in DNA replication or repair cannot be excluded. In this regard, note that significant difference was observed when replication protein A is phosphorylated in SV40 DNA replication (41Henricksen L.A. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Further studies are needed to answer the question of the regulatory consequences of phosphorylation of pol δ and for that matter other replication proteins. The putative kinase consensus sequences in pol δ also show that it could be a substrate for DNA-dependent protein kinase. The latter kinase phosphorylates serine or threonine residues that are followed or preceded by glutamine residues (S/T)-Q or Q-(S/T). It remains to be determined whether other kinases, e.g.DNA-dependent protein kinase, are also involved in the phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of pol δ.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enzymes has shown that it consists of at least two core subunits of 125 and 50 kDa. The hallmarks of this polymerase are that it has an intrinsic 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, distinguishing it from pol α and pol β. The 125-kDa subunit of human pol δ (p125) has been identified as the catalytic subunit (4Lee M.Y.W.T. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Toomey N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2423-2429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pol δ is a member of a family of DNA polymerases which includes DNA polymerase α, pol ε, the herpesvirus DNA polymerases, and bacteriophage T4 polymerase (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P.

Examination of the regions of conserved sequence has led to the identification of domains that are potentially required for DNA interaction, deoxynucleotide interaction, as well as the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity of pol δ (7Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several regions in the NH2 and COOH termini which are conserved among human pol δ, yeast pol δ, and yeast and human pol ε (5Hao H. Jiang Y. Zhang S.-J. Zhang P. Zeng X.-R. Lee M.Y.W.T. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1992; 102: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Yang C.L. Chang L.S. Zhang P. Hao H. Toomey N.L. Zhu L. Lee M.Y.W.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 735-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Studies of the replication of SV40 DNA in vitro have led to the identification of a number of accessory proteins, which, together with pol δ, are required for the formation of a replication complex at the replication fork. These include PCNA, which functions as a sliding clamp and enhances the processivity of pol δ, consistent with its role as the leading strand polymerase (8Krishna T.S.R. Kong X.-P. Gary S. Burgers P.M.J. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1994; 79: 1233-1243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Although there have been some mutagenesis studies of the yeast pol δ (9Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), little has been done with human or mammalian pol δ, largely because of the lack of a suitable expression system. To facilitate structure-function studies of pol δ, it is desirable to have an expression system for the production of the recombinant protein. The expression of the human pol δ catalytic subunit has been achieved in mammalian cells using a vaccinia virus vector (10Zhang P. Frugulhetti I. Jiang Y. Holt G.L. Condit R.C. Lee M.Y.W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7993-7998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study we report the expression of p125 in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector as well as methods for separating the recombinant protein from endogenous DNA polymerases in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. Deletion mutants of p125 were also characterized to investigate the domain structure of pol δ. In addition, we have obtained novel evidence that pol δ p125 is phosphorylated by the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)-cyclin complexes and also can be coimmunoprecipitated with cdk2 when they are coexpressed in Sf9 insect cells. The interaction of pol δ with the cyclins and cdks was also confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments in Molt 4 cells. Preliminary experiments showed that phosphorylation has moderate or little effect on the activity of the catalytic subunit. DISCUSSIONThe studies reported here show that the catalytic subunit of DNA pol δ can be expressed in Sf9 cells in an active form and can be isolated by a conventional purification protocol or by an immunoaffinity chromatography procedure. Isolation of the recombinant protein was aided by the use of antibodies against pol δ which did not cross-react with the endogenous DNA polymerase in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells. We took advantage of an immunoaffinity chromatography procedure to purify the recombinant pol δ in a facile manner and to ascertain that it was separated from any endogenous DNA polymerases. The properties of the overexpressed p125 catalytic subunit were compared with those of the native enzyme. Assays of the enzyme activity using poly(dA)·oligo(dT) as a template showed that the specific activities of the preparations were only about 1,200 units/mg (Table I) compared with about 25,000 units/mg protein for the calf thymus holoenzyme (14Jiang Y. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This difference is likely the result of the lack of, or of a greatly attenuated response to PCNA by the free catalytic subunit. Other studies of pol δ preparations containing only the catalytic subunit have suggested that it is not PCNA-responsive (18Goulian M. Herrmann S.M. Sackett J.W. Grimm S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16402-16411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chiang C.S. Mitsis P.G. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9105-9109Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), whereas our previous studies of recombinant pol δ expressed in vaccinia virus have indicated a weak response (2–3-fold stimulation). The baculovirus-expressed pol δ shows little or no response to PCNA, whereas the response is restored by the presence of the p50 subunit (20Zhou J.Q. Tan C.K. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29740-29745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 21Zhou J.Q. He H. Tan C.K. Downey K.M. So A.G.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13013-13018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In other aspects, the enzymatic behavior of the recombinant p125 is very similar to that of the holoenzyme.Studies of deletion mutants show that deletions (amino acids 2–249 or 186–321) in the NH2 terminus retain polymerase activity. Deletions in the core region (amino acids 336–715) and the deletion of regions C and V in the core as well as most of the COOH-terminal region including the zinc finger motifs (778–1047) had no assayable activity (Table II). This is consistent with numerous other studies that indicate that the core region of this family of polymerases is involved in the binding of the incoming dNTP substrate (23Dong Q. Wang T.S.-F. J.

A classical example of the former is murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MuLV RT), while human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RT represents the latter. A careful scrutiny of the amino acid sequence alignment of the two enzymes pinpoints the region tentatively responsible for this phenomenon. We report here the construction of a chimeric enzyme containing the first 425 amino acid residues from the N-terminal domain of HIV-1 RT and 200 amino acid residues from the C-terminal domain of MuLV RT.

Human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase is a heterodimeric enzyme comprised of 66- and 51-kDa subunits. The p51 subunit of the heterodimer is derived from the p66 subunit due to proteolytic cleavage and removal of the RNase-H domain (1Di Marzo Veronese F. Copeland T.D. DeVico A.L. Rahman R.

Virol. 1986; 60: 771-775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the folding of p51 is remarkably distinct from that of p66. The polymerase domain of p66 folds into an open cleft while that of p51 assumes a closed conformation (4Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the monomeric form of p66 also exists in a closed conformation topologically similar to that of p51 and that the polymerase domain opens up into a large cleft only upon dimerization with p51 (5Wang J. Smerdon S.J. Jager J. Kohlstaedt L.A. Rice P.A. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The three distinct contact points between p51 and p66 have been discerned from the crystal structure resolution, namely the connection domain, the tip of the finger subdomain of p51, and the extended thumb region that supports the RNase-H region of p66.

RT is also found in many other retroviruses, namely, FIV, SIV, HIV-2, and EIAV. Interestingly, murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase is functionally active as a monomer. Although, both MuLV RT and HIV-1 RT exhibit similar enzymatic properties, their architectural organization vastly differs as the former exists as a monomer whereas the latter is a heterodimer. It has not yet been possible to elucidate the region in the sequences of these two reverse transcriptases that necessitates dimer formation in HIV-1 RT while posing no such requirement in MuLV RT. In our effort to identify the region in MuLV RT (which might be missing in HIV-1 RT) that obviate the need for dimerization of this enzyme, we compared the primary sequence of MuLV RT with that of HIV-1 RT. We observed three major motifs containing from 11 to 28 amino acids, which are present in MuLV RT but lacking in HIV-1 RT. We therefore speculated that the conspicuous absence of these motifs in the sequence of HIV-1 RT may have imposed the dimeric requirement for catalytic function. To ascertain this postulation we constructed a chimeric HIV-1 RT containing two of these motifs and the entire RNase-H domain from MuLV RT. The resulting chimeric HIV-1 RT was found to be a monomeric enzyme with intact polymerase and RNase-H functions. These studies form the subject matter of the present investigation. DNA restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes,Taq DNA polymerase for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), along with PCR buffer and HPLC-purified dNTPs were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Fast flow chelating Sepharose (iminodiacetic-Sepharose) for immobilized metal affinity chromatography was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and32P-labeled dNTPs and ATP were the products of NEN Life Science Products. Synthetic oligomeric primers were obtained from the Molecular Resource Facility of University of Medicine and Dentistry-New Jersey Medical School and were further purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6Maxam A.

All other reagents were of the highest available purity grade and purchased from Fisher, Millipore Corp., Boehringer Mannheim, and Bio-Rad. Expression vector pET-24b, pET-28a and Escherichia coli expression strain BL21 (DE3) were obtained from Novagen. The HIV-1 RT, MuLV RT, and Klenow fragment expression clones (pET-28a-RT66, pET-28a-RT51, and pET-28a-MRT) constructed in this laboratory were used for PCR amplification and construction of the chimeric HIV-1 RT (7Pandey V.N.

Biochemistry. 1966; 35: 7256-7266Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar) were carried out from recombinant clones according to published protocols. The homodimeric p66/66 HIV-1 RT also contains species of the heterodimeric p66/51 generated during the process of purification by bacterial proteolytic cleavage. The chimeric HIV-1 RT containing the polymerase domain of HIV-1 RT and the RNase-H domain of MuLV RT was constructed as follows. The 582-base pair sequence containing the entire RNase-H domain of the MuLV RT gene spanning from codons 471 to 670 was amplified by PCR (13Saiki R.K. Scharf S.J. Faloona Mullis K.B. Horn G.T. Ehrlich H.A. Arnheim N. Science. 1985; 230: 1350-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar). The plasmid pET-28a-MRT containing the coding region for the full-length MuLV RT was used as the template for PCR amplification. The sequences of the up stream primer and the down stream primer were 5′-GTG GTA GCC CTG GTAC CAA AAC CCG GCT ACG-3′ and 5′-TAT AGG GACC CTC GAG TGA CAT TAA CCT ATA, respectively. In the same step, we introduced the KpnI restriction site at the 5′-end and XhoI site at the 3′-end of the RNase-H coding sequence of MuLV RT. Using these restriction sites the amplified fragment was restriction digested and ligated with the KpnI- and XhoI-digested pET-24b-RT51 expression cassette to construct the pET-24b-CRT71 clone. This construct contains a 5′ T7 promoter and codes for the chimeric HIV-1 RT with the metal binding His-Tag sequences at the C-terminal region. The screening of clones for the appropriate insert (1858 base pairs) was carried out in HB101. The positive clone was introduced into E. coli BL-21(DE3)pLysS for expression of the chimeric HIV-1 RT. Induction of the enzyme protein was carried out as described before for the wild type HIV-1 RT (14Sarafianos S.G. Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Modak M.J.

The chimeric enzyme was purified from bacterial lysate by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (7Pandey V.N. Kaushik N. Rege N. Sarafianos S.G. Yadav P.N.S. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A clone for the tRNA3Lys gene (pTL9) was obtained from Dr. S. F. J. Le Grice. A 256-base pair region of the clone containing the T7 promoter and the gene for full-length tRNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction as described (16Richter N.J. Howard K.J. Cirino N.M. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15952-15957PubMed Google Scholar). The PCR product was used as the template for in vitro transcription of tRNA3Lys using T7 RNA polymerase. For internal labeling of tRNA3Lys, 200 μm of [α-32P]UTP (specific activity: 1 μCi/60 pmol; reaction volume: 30 μl) was included in the transcription reaction. The labeled tRNA was purified by denaturing 8% polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. The gel-purified32P-labeled tRNA3Lys was stored at −70 °C in a solution containing 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 1 unit/μl of RNasin. Fifty micrograms of chimeric HIV-1 RT in Tris-NaCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 400 mm NaCl) was carefully loaded onto 5 ml of 10–30% glycerol gradients prepared in the same buffer. Gradients were centrifuged at 48,000 rpm for 22 h in an SW48 rotor. Gradients were fractionated from the bottom, and each fraction was assayed for polymerase activity using [3H]dTTP as the substrate and poly(rA)·(dT)18 as the template primer. Fractions were also subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to determine the protein peak fraction. Sedimentation analyses of the marker enzymes, HIV-1 RT, MuLV RT, and Klenow fragment were also carried out simultaneously and compared with the sedimentation pattern obtained with the chimeric enzyme. The HIV-1 RT preparation contained both homodimeric p66/66 and heterodimeric p66/51 species. Heteromeric synthetic 30-mer RNA and 49-mer DNA templates corresponding to the U5-PBS region of HIV-1 RNA were primed with 5′-32P-labeled DNA PBS primers and used to assess the polymerase activities. In addition, homopolymeric template primer, Poly(rA)·5′-32P-labeled (dT)18 was also used for detecting the polymerase activity. Polymerase reactions were carried out by incubating 2.5 nm template primer with 50 nm wild type HIV-1 RT or its chimeric derivative in a total reaction volume of 6 μl containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 μmamounts of each dNTP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme and terminated by the addition of equal volume of Sanger's gel loading dye (17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar). The reaction products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. We used a 30-mer synthetic RNA template corresponding to the PBS region of the HIV genome (3′-CAG GGA CAA GCC CGC GGU GAC GAU CUC UAA-5′) for assessing the RNase-H activity. The RNA template was 5′-32P-labeled and purified by 8% denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel electrophoresis. The labeled template was annealed with 30-mer complementary DNA. The RNA-DNA hybrid was separately incubated with the enzyme under standard reaction conditions. The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 5 nmlabeled hybrid (104 Cerenkov counts/min), 80 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 ng of enzyme. Reactions were carried out at 25 °C for different time points, and the reaction products were analyzed on 16% denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel. We compared the primary amino acid sequences of HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT in order to locate the region that confers dimeric or monomeric structure to these enzymes, respectively. Three major motifs, A, B, and C in the primary amino acid sequence of MuLV RT, conspicuously absent in the sequence of HIV-1 RT emerged (Fig. 1). Motif A, the longest, is comprised of 27 amino acids spanning residues 479–505 and lies in the putative connection subdomain of MuLV RT. Motif B, found in the RNase-H domain spans residues 597–611, while the motif C containing residues 318–328 is located in the polymerase domain. We suspected that the absence of these motifs in the primary amino acid sequence of HIV-1 RT may have imposed the need for its dimerization. We, therefore, constructed a chimeric HIV-1 RT containing the first 425 codons from the N-terminal of HIV-1 RT and 200 codons from the C-terminal of MuLV RT. The C-terminal fragment of MuLV RT contained part of its connection subdomain and the entire RNase-H domain, including motifs A and B. The chimeric HIV-1 RT was cloned in pET-24b vector, expressed in E. coli BL 21(DE3), and purified by metal affinity column chromatography (Fig. 2 A). The purified enzyme exhibited both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity (see below).Figure 2A, SDS-PAGE of the chimeric HIV-1 RT containing the RNase-H domain of MuLV RT.

The internally32P-labeled tRNA3Lys (5 × 105 Cerenkov counts/min) was incubated on ice with 10 μg of chimeric RT, MuLV RT, or wild type HIV-1 RT. The complexes were subjected to gel retardation analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% nondenaturing native gel. The electrophoresis was carried out at in a Tris borate buffer system at 4 °C at 100 volts for 4 h followed by autoradiography.

Marcus S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter two enzymes serving as controls. The gradients were fractionated from the bottom and analyzed for their polymerase activity and the protein peak profile (Fig. 2 B and C). It was observed that the heterodimeric HIV-1 RT sedimented between fractions 12 and 15, while the chimeric RT and MuLV RT sedimented between fractions 22 and 24 of the gradient. This observation clearly establishes the existence of the chimeric HIV-1 RT as a monomer as it sediments at a position higher than the sedimentation position of the dimeric HIV-1 RT but closer to that of the monomeric MuLV RT. Binding studies with tRNA3Lys, a natural primer for HIV-1 RT, using gel retardation assay indicated a mobility shift distinct from the wild type HIV-1 RT on native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 D). The chimeric HIV-1 RT migrated ahead of the wild type HIV-1 RT, but closer to MuLV RT. This also indicated that, unlike HIV-1 RT, the chimeric RT is a monomeric enzyme. The bands shown in the autoradiogram appear slightly elongated due to the overloading of the tRNA bound enzyme protein on the gel. This was essential in order to obtain sufficient signal as all the three enzymes exhibit poor binding affinity with the synthetic tRNA3Lys. HPLC gel filtration of HIV-1 RT, chimeric HIV-1 RT, and MuLV RT (19Wöhrl B.M. Krebs R. Thrall S.H. Le Grice S.F.J. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 28: 17581-17587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using two BioSep 300 columns (300 × 7.8 mm; Phenomenex Inc.) also indicated the existence of the chimeric enzyme as a monomer (data not shown). Although MuLV RT exists as a monomer in solution, it has been suggested to be in a dimeric form when bound to the template primer (20Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to examine if the chimeric HIV-1 RT also dimerizes upon binding to the template primer. We therefore photocross-linked wild type HIV-1 RT, MuLV RT, Klenow fragment, and chimeric HIV-1 RT with 5′-32P-labeled 37-mer self-annealing template primer. The radioactive E-TP covalent species were purified on DEAE-cellulose column and subjected to glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation analysis. The sedimentation profile of labeledE-TP complex was determined by analyzing the gradient fractions by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. The results are as shown in Fig. 3 (also see Table I). Contrary to an earlier report (20Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the DNA-bound MuLV RT sedimented as a monomer close to the DNA-bound Klenow fragment but farther from the DNA bound dimeric HIV-1 RT. The DNA-bound chimeric HIV-1 RT also sedimented as a monomer at the position between that of the DNA-bound Klenow fragment and MuLV RT. These results provide further proof that both MuLV RT and chimeric HIV-1 RT do not dimerize upon binding to the template primer.Table ISequences of synthetic template and primer oligonucleotidesTemplate/primerSequence37-Mer self-annealing template primer with photoactivableCACGCAGTCTTCTÜC-3′ bromodeoxyuridine (Ü)baseTCACGTCAGAAGAAGATCCCTC-5′18-Mer PBS primer5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCA-3′22-Mer PBS primer5′-GTCCCTGTTCGGGCGCCACTGC-3′49-Mer U5-PBS DNA template3′-CAGGGACAAGCCCGCGGTGACGATCTCTAAAAGGTGTGACTGATTTTCCC-5′30-Mer U5-PBS RNA3′-CAGGGACAAGCCCGCGGUGACGAUCUCUAA-5′ Open table in a new tab The purified chimeric HIV-1 RT was examined for its DNA polymerase activity employing homopolymeric and heteropolymeric RNA and DNA templates primed with 5′-32P-labeled DNA primer (7Pandey V.N.

The chimeric enzyme was found to catalyze DNA synthesis efficiently on both RNA and DNA templates, yielding RNA:DNA hybrid and duplex DNA, respectively (Fig. 4, A–C). As shown in the figure, the extent of full-length product catalyzed by the chimeric enzyme was similar to that found with wild type HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT. Further analysis shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates the ability of the chimeric enzyme to catalyze both endonucleolytic and processive RNase-H functions in a manner similar to the wild type HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT. This is so far the first report that a chimeric HIV-1 RT containing the entire RNase-H domain from MuLV RT has been constructed with intact RNase-H and DNA polymerase functions. Earlier Hizi et al.(21Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Shaharabany M. Virology. 1990; 175: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) constructed two chimeric HIV-1 RTs and found them both to be inactive with respect to their polymerase activities while exhibiting low levels of RNase-H activity. Post et al. (22Post K. Guo J. Kalman E. Ucchida T. Crouch R.J. Levin J.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5508-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have constructed a chimeric RT by replacing the RNase-H domain of MuLV RT with E. coli RNase-H. The resulting enzyme was found to be impaired in catalyzing DNA synthesis, although it exhibited 300-fold higher RNase-H activity as compared with the wild type MuLV RT. It is not known whether chimeric MuLV RT with E. coli RNase-H exists as a monomer or dimer. In contrast, the chimeric HIV-1 RT constructed by us exhibits high levels of both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities in addition to fully functional RNase-H activity.Figure 5RNase-H activity of chimeric HIV-1 RT.5′-32P-Labeled 30-mer RNA annealed with 30-mer complementary DNA strands was incubated at 25 °C under standard conditions with the chimeric RT as well as with the wild type HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT for the indicated time points. The cleavage product of the RNA strand was analyzed on a denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The region responsible for conferring monomeric structure to the chimeric HIV-1 RT seems to be the introduction of either motif A or motif B contributed by nonconserved connection subdomain and RNase-H domain of MuLV RT. Interestingly, Motif A region of MuLV RT exhibits 46% similarity and 21% identity with the region spanning residues 108–141 in the N-terminal region of HIV-1 RT. This region of HIV-1 RT contains β6, αC, αD, β7, and β7-β8 loop, which are constituents of the finger and palm subdomains of the enzyme. The β7 and β7-β8 loop in p66 are far away from the catalytic cleft, while in the p51 subunit they are in the vicinity of the catalytic cleft of the p66 subunit (23Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). In p51, the β7-β8 loop also contains the interaction site for a non-nucleoside inhibitor (Glu-138), TSAO. Interaction of Glu-138 of the p51 subunit with TSAO results in inactivation of the polymerase function of the enzyme (24Jonckheere H. Taymans J.M. Balzarini J. Velazquez S. Camarasa M.J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25255-25258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional crystal structure of the heterodimeric HIV-1 RT, the β7β8 loop of the finger subdomain of the p51 subunit is the constituent of the subunit interaction surface. It seems to interact with the floor (palm) of the polymerase domain of the p66 subunit, which consequently may induce the opening of the polymerase cleft. This contention is supported by the fact that interaction of TSAO with the β7β8 loop of p51 destabilizes the enzyme into inactive monomers with concomitant loss of DNA binding ability and polymerase function (Fig. 6, A–C). Interestingly, the chimeric HIV-1 RT is completely insensitive to TSAO treatment, as both the DNA binding ability and polymerase activity of the TSAO-treated chimeric enzyme remained unaffected (Fig. 6, Band C). Unlike, in the wild type HIV-1 RT, the β7β8 loop in the chimeric HIV-1 RT may be inaccessible for binding to the TSAO, thus manifesting in a complete resistance to this inhibitor. Alternatively, due to the absence of the subunit interacting surface in the chimeric enzyme the binding site for TSAO may not exist. We propose that the β7-β8 loop of the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT may structurally compensate for the missing motif A in the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT. Insertion of this motif in the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT is currently being carried out to ascertain whether the resulting enzyme is functional in the monomeric form. Why does the p66 subunit of HIV-1 RT need leverage from the p51 subunit? Can it support its open conformation independent of p51? One possibility is that the elongated p66 subunit may be unable to hold its polymerase and RNase-H domains in an unsteady horizontal position and therefore may require support from p51. In the chimeric RT, the positioning of the polymerase and RNase-H domains may be such that one domain supports the other thus circumventing the need for its dimerization. Probably, the extended connection subdomain may help in positioning both the domains in such a fashion. This presumption is supported by the observation that the putative connection subdomain of MuLV RT, as determined by aligning of its primary amino acid sequence with that of HIV-1 RT, is longer than that of HIV-1 RT, and this may possibly be one of the factors for its monomeric structure. We thank M. J. Modak and N. Kaushik for critical reading of the manuscript. We acknowledge P. N. S. Yadav and R. T. Whipple for their help in the analysis of sequence alignment of HIV-1 RT and MuLV RT. The TSAO was generously provided by J. Balzarini."
https://openalex.org/W2048639458,"Recent reports have shown that the binding of ATP to a 70-kDa molecular chaperone induces a rapid global conformational transition from a “high affinity” state to a “low affinity” state, where these states are defined by tight and weak binding to (poly)peptides, respectively. To complete the activity cycle, a chaperone molecule must ultimately return to the high affinity state. In this report, this return to the high affinity state was studied using a chemical cross-linking assay in conjunction with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The basis for this assay is that in the absence of nucleotide or in the presence of ADP, conditions that stabilize the high affinity state, cross-linking of the Escherichia coli molecular chaperone DnaK yielded two monomeric forms, with apparent molecular masses of 70 kDa (77%) and 90 kDa (23%), whereas cross-linking yielded only the 70-kDa monomeric form in the presence of ATP. This ATP-dependent difference in cross-linking was used to follow the kinetics of the low affinity to high affinity transition under single turnover conditions. The rate of this transition (kobs = 3.4 (±0.6) × 10−4 s−1 at 25 °C) is almost identical to the reported rate of ATP hydrolysis (khy = 2.7 (±0.7) × 10−4 s−1 at 22 °C). These results are consistent with a two-step sequential reaction where rate-limiting ATP hydrolysis precedes the conformational change.

The highly conserved and ubiquitous 70-kDa family of molecular chaperones, which include stress induced (Hsp70) 1The abbreviations used are: Hsp70, 70-kDa heat shock protein; AMP-PNP, adenyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate; Hsc70, 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. and constitutively expressed (Hsc70) variants, promote protein-protein interactions via the of coupling ATP binding and hydrolysis to selective substrate binding and release. Molecular chaperones use this activity cycle to perform diverse biological processes such as the stabilization of partially unfolded and nascent proteins, protein translocation, and protein complex assembly and disassembly under normal growth and stress conditions (for reviews, see Refs. 1Georgopoulos C.

The underlying molecular events that enable the coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to selective substrate binding and release are poorly understood. The three-dimensional structure of the two separate 70-kDa chaperone functional domains have been determined. The NH2-terminal domain of Hsc70 binds nucleotide in the base of a cleft formed by two subdomains (4Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Two K+ ions and a Mg2+ ion are cofactors in the ATPase reaction by interacting with nucleotides in this cleft (5Wilbanks S.M. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2251-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The requirement for K+ is specific, because when K+ is replaced by Na+, (i) the rate of Hsc70-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis is five times slower (6O'Brien M.C. McKay D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and (ii) DnaK-protein complexes do not dissociate in the presence of ATP (7Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The COOH-terminal domain of DnaK (residues 389–607) binds a peptide substrate in a channel formed by the loops from a β-sandwich (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism which couples the activities of the two domains is not understood. Several lines of evidence indicate that ATP induces a global structural transition in a 70-kDa chaperone molecule from a high affinity state to a low affinity state (9Liberek K. Skowyra D. Zylicz M.

The high affinity state tightly binds (poly)peptides, whereas the low affinity state weakly binds (poly)peptides. Significantly, the induction of this structural transition is a consequence of ATP binding and not hydrolysis, because the rate of the transition (0.7 s−1) (14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) is much faster than chaperone-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (0.003–0.0005 s−1) (7Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J.

It appears that ATP hydrolysis is involved in the reverse transition, that is, the return from the low affinity state to the high affinity state (12Wilbanks S.M. Chen L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B.

Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Small-angle x-ray scattering experiments conducted on recombinant bovine Hsc70 have indicated that the reverse reaction occurs in at least two steps, where the hydrolysis of ATP is followed by rate-limiting product release (14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this report, a chemical cross-linking/SDS-PAGE assay was used to visualize the slow transition from the low affinity state to the high affinity state of the Escherichia coli 70-kDa molecular chaperone DnaK under single turnover conditions. The results are consistent with a two-step sequential reaction where ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting rather than product release, and ATP hydrolysis induces a second reaction, a structural transition in the chaperone molecule. This assay can also be used to probe the effect of other parameters such as salt, temperature, and even cochaperones, on the kinetics of the transition. DnaK was isolated from the E. coli strain RLM893 (18Zylicz M. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8820-8825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (19Farr C.D. Galiano F.J. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15574-15582Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protein was maintained in a K+/HEPES sample buffer (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at pH = 7.0) and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard and verified spectrophotometrically (ε280 = 15.8 × 103m−1cm−1) (20Montgomery D. Jordan R. McMacken R. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 680-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that the DnaK preparations were >95% pure. For some of the cross-linking and fluorescence experiments DnaK was dialyzed into a Na+/HEPES sample buffer (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at pH = 7.0). All reagents were purchased from Sigma. Samples of DnaK were cross-linked for 2 min at 25 °C with glutaraldehyde (final concentration: 11 mm), and the reaction was stopped by the addition of an excess of glycine (final concentration: 200 mm). Cross-linked samples were loaded onto either a 4–12% linear gradient denaturing polyacrylamide gel or a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, electrophoresed, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. Gel lanes were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics densitometer to determine the relative amount of species in each lane. A Photon Technology Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) StrobeMaster lifetime spectrometer with a SE-900 steady state fluorescence option was used to monitor the slow increase in tryptophan fluorescence in the single turnover experiments. In these experiments the instrument was used in a time base mode, with λex = 295 (3-nm bandwidth) and λem = 340 nm (5-nm bandwidth). Samples were maintained in a quartz cuvette (1-cm path length) with constant stirring and with temperature control via an external circulating heating/cooling bath (ΔT = ± 0.2 °C). Sample temperature was verified using a hand held thermocouple, which was placed directly into the sample. The equilibrium and kinetic data were fit to the equations in the text using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy, Reading, PA). All experiments were repeated three to four times. The value for the equilibrium dissociation constant for ATP binding to DnaK has an error of 20%, while the values for the kinetic constants have 5 − 10% error. In the course of conducting cross-linking experiments to determine the conditions that promote the oligomerization of DnaK (21Farr C.D. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we have noticed that the treatment of DnaK (20 μm) with glutaraldehyde produces two distinct monomer bands as well as dimer and trimer bands (Fig. 1 A). On a 4–12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, one monomer band is centered at a molecular mass of 70-kDa, as expected, while the upper monomer band is centered at an apparent molecular mass of 90-kDa. The broad protein bands are probably due to variations in the amount of intramolecular cross-linking (22Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 23Benaroudj N. Fang B. Triniolles F. Ghelis C. Ladjimi M.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Previously, two or more chaperone monomer bands have been reported and were attributed to heterogeneous cross-linking (22Schlossman D.M. Schmid S.L. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Gao B. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16792-16797Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this report, the occurrence of these two monomer bands was exploited to visualize ATP-induced conformational transitions in DnaK. Fig. 1 Bshows the effect of nucleotides on the cross-linking of DnaK in the monomer region. At the concentration of DnaK (6 μm) used in these experiments, 85–90% of the protein is monomeric (21Farr C.D. Witt S.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10793-10800Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since 10% polyacrylamide gels gave a slightly better separation of the two monomer bands, 10% gels were used in these experiments. 2The apparent molecular mass of the slower migrating DnaK monomer was 90 kDa in the 4–12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and 110 kDa in the 10% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. We believe that the gradient gel gives a more accurate molecular mass for the slower migrating monomer than the 10% gel; therefore the slower migrating monomer is referred to as the apparent molecular mass 90-kDa species. Uncross-linked DnaK appeared as a single monomer band (lane 1), whereas DnaK that was cross-linked in the absence of nucleotide appeared as two monomer bands (lane 2). When DnaK was cross-linked in the presence of ADP (2.0 mm), the two monomer bands were still present (lane 3). In contrast, cross-linking in the presence of ATP (2.0 mm) abolished the upper monomer band (lane 4). Other nucleotide triphosphates, GTP, CTP, and UTP, also abolished the upper monomer band (data not shown). On the other hand, cross-linking in the presence of AMP-PNP (2.0 mm), a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, had no effect on the upper band (lane 5). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the abolition of the upper monomer band is a consequence of a highly specific conformational change in DnaK, induced by the action of hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphates. The γ-phosphate group -O-PγO32− of the nucleotide triphosphate is required for the induction of the conformational change since the nucleotide triphosphate AMP-PNP, where the γ-phosphate group is -NH-PγO32−, did not induce the conformational change. Possibly the nitrogen atom linkage in AMP-PNP modifies the coordination of Mg2+, which in turn prevents the proper docking of AMP-PNP within the ATP binding site of DnaK. Two models are proposed to explain the above results (Fig. 2). In both models: (i) E and E** stand for high and low affinity chaperone states, respectively; (ii) reaction intermediates have been ignored; (iii) in the absence of ATP, all DnaK molecules populate the E state; (iv) and the binding of hydrolyzable nucleotide triphosphates to the E state drives the conversion to the E** state. Model 1 is a two-state mechanism defined by two distinct chaperone conformations, the E and E** states. It is postulated that certain structural features of the E state (and the E-ADP state) promote heterogeneous cross-linking. The upper monomer band is probably due to a population of DnaK monomers with a large number of intramolecular cross-links, which tend to inhibit SDS loading and therefore lead to an apparent molecular mass higher than 70 kDa; whereas, the lower band is probably due to a population of DnaK monomers with a relatively small number of intramolecular cross-links. ATP binding to the E state produces the E** state, which happens to cross-link homogeneously, yielding a single monomer band. Model 2 is a three-state mechanism defined by two distinct E state isomers (Ea ⇔ Eb) and oneE** state. Since there are two E state isomers, cross-linking produces two bands. Upon the addition of ATP, either bothE states convert to the E** state directly, or one state converts to the E** state and the equilibrium readjusts. Both paths lead to the E** state, which yields one band on cross-linking. An alternative interpretation of the gel data that does not assume the validity of (iii) is discussed below. If Model 2 is correct it should be possible to separate the E state isomers. In an attempt to separate the putative isomers, DnaK was electrophoresed on both a 10–15% and a 15–20% linear gradient nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and, in each case, a single band was observed. Although unsuccessful in our attempts to separate these putative isomers, Model 2 should not be ruled out, as discussed below. The thermodynamics of ATP binding to DnaK were investigated by exploiting the different cross-linking patterns of DnaK in the absence and presence of ATP. Samples of DnaK (6.0 μm) with varying amounts of ATP were incubated for 1 min at 25 °C and then cross-linked. Fig. 3 A shows the relative amounts of the two monomer bands before and after the addition of ATP. The upper monomer band was abolished when [ATP]/[DnaK] ≥ 1.6, indicating that the population of the E state was also abolished. The data in Fig. 3 A were used to estimate the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for ATP binding to DnaK according to Model 1 (Fig. 2). Each lane in the gel was scanned to determine the fraction of the upper monomer band (fE), which is an indicator of the amount of the E state, and then fE was plotted as a function of the total concentration of ATP (Fig. 3 B). The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant for the reactionE**-ATP ⇔ + ATP is related to fE according to Equation 1,1/fE=1+[ATP]free/KdEquation 1 where [ATP]free was estimated by [ATP]free = [ATP]0 − [E]0(1 − fE). The plot of 1/fE versus[ATP]free is linear (Fig. 3 B, inset), and the reciprocal of the slope yields a Kd value of 0.19 (±0.04) μm. This Kd value is almost identical to the upper limit for Kd of 0.22 μm that was determined from pre-steady state kinetic experiments (17Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Since the upper monomer band is abolished at near stoichiometric concentrations of ATP, the assay is an ideal way to monitor the kinetics of structural transitions in a DnaK monomer that occur during a single turnover. Single turnover experiments at 25 °C were conducted by adding a stoichiometric amount of ATP (6.0 μm) to a solution of DnaK (6.0 μm) in a K+/HEPES buffer (Fig. 4 A). Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and cross-linked as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Prior to the addition of ATP to DnaK, the two monomer bands were present (lane 1), indicative of the Estate. Two minutes after the addition of ATP, the upper monomer band was abolished (lane 2). The slow reappearance of the upper band is shown in lanes 3–9. The lanes were scanned with a densitometer to determine the relative amounts of the two DnaK monomers, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4 B. The reappearance of the signal from the upper monomer band followed single exponential kinetics according to S(t) =A(1 − e−kobst) + B, with kobs = 3.4 (±0.6) × 10−4 s−1. Significantly, this rate is identical within experimental error to the reported steady state rate of DnaK-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (khy = 2.7 (±0.7) × 10−4 s−1 at 22 °C) (25Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On the basis of these gel kinetic results, we conclude that (i) the ATP-induced transition from the high affinity state to the low affinity state is fast (t½ < 2 min) in the presence of K+ ions, therefore this transition is due to ATP binding and not hydrolysis; and (ii) the reverse transition (E** →E) occurs at the same rate as DnaK-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Complementary single turnover experiments were conducted to see whether the reported slow change in tryptophan fluorescence (14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 17Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) matched the slow conformational transition detected in these gel experiments. ATP induced changes in the tryptophan fluorescence of DnaK on two distinctly different time scales: upon the addition of ATP, a 15% decrease in fluorescence occurred within 1 min and then the decrease was slowly reversed over the course of an hour (Fig. 5). Specifically, the slow increase in fluorescence followed single-exponential kinetics, withkobs = 3.0 (±0.3) × 10−4s−1. For comparison, the gel kinetic data from Fig. 4 B are superimposed on the fluorescence data. On the basis of the similarity of the two kinetic curves, we conclude that both methods monitor the low affinity state to high affinity state transition (E** → E) and that the change in tryptophan fluorescence occurs in concert with the conformational transition. Since Na+ ions inhibit the high affinity state to low affinity state transition (7Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), Na+ ions should also inhibit the ATP-induced elimination of the upper monomer band. To test this idea, single turnover gel- and fluorescence-detected experiments were also conducted in a Na+/HEPES buffer. Using the gel assay we found that Na+ ions almost completely prevented the ATP-induced elimination of the upper monomer band (Fig. 5,inset). Similarly, Na+ ions both attenuated the initial reduction in fluorescence upon the addition of ATP and retarded the rate of reappearance of the fluorescence. That Na+ ions inhibit the ATP-induced abolition of the upper monomer band is consistent with our claim that the abolition of the upper monomer band is an indicator of the high affinity state to low affinity state transition. The gel- and fluorescence-detected single turnover experiments showed that ATP induces a rapid conformational change in a molecule of DnaK. For example, the addition of a stoichiometric amount of ATP to DnaK lead to the elimination of the upper monomer band (Fig. 4 A) within 2 min or less. Similarly, the addition of a stoichiometric amount of ATP to DnaK resulted in a rapid reduction in fluorescence (Fig. 5). Since the rapid conformational change and the rapid spectral change occur much faster than the steady state rate of ATP hydrolysis (25Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Fink A.L. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and because no rapid burst phase of ATP hydrolysis has been detected in any single turnover experiments (7Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), we conclude that the conformational change and the attending spectral change are due to ATP binding to DnaK. This conformational change is consistent with the high affinity state to low affinity state transition (E → E**) (7Palleros D.R. Reid K.L. Shi L. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Prasad K. Heuser J. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major finding in this study was that the gel-detected conformational change and the change in tryptophan fluorescence occur at exactly the same rate (3 × 10−4s−1), the rate of DnaK-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. The simplest explanation of these results is that ATP hydrolysis and the conformational change in the chaperone occur simultaneously, according to Reaction 1.E**ATP→khyE­ADPEquation EReaction 1 However, it is unlikely that the cleavage of the γ-phosphate group of ATP and a global conformational change in DnaK occur at precisely the same instant. A more likely explanation is that ATP hydrolysis precedes the conformational change, according to Reaction 2.E**­ATP→khyE**ADP→kcE­ADPEquation EReaction 2 We therefore attempted to fit the single turnover kinetic data to Equation 2, which describes product formation according to the above two-step mechanism, whereS(t)=A1−kce−khyt−khye−kctkc−khy+B,Equation 2 S(t) is the signal due to the product,A is the amplitude, khy and kc are the first-order rate constants defined in Reaction 2, and B is the offset. A similar function has been used to fit single turnover data from fluorescence experiments (14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,17Theyssen H. Schuster H.-P. Packschies L. Bukau B. Reinstein J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 657-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, due to the small number of data points, the gel kinetic data (Fig. 4 B) could not be reasonably fit to Equation 2. On the other hand, the large number of data points in the fluorescence traces allowed those traces (Fig. 5) to be fit to Equation2. The best fit curves were nearly superimposable on the data, and the best fit values for khy and kc were 3.0 (±0.2) × 10−4s−1 and 1.9 (±0.5) × 10−3 s−1, respectively. It is noteworthy that when ATP hydrolysis is rate-limiting (khy <kc), Equation 2 simplifies toS(t) = A(1 − e−khyt) + B, which explains why the single turnover data followed single exponential kinetics and why kobs =khy. In conclusion, the single turnover kinetic data from both assays are consistent with Reaction 2, where ATP hydrolysis occurs first and is rate-limiting. 3It is theoretically possible that the slow E** → E transition in DnaK is due to the two-step reactionE**ATP → E-ATP → E-ADP, where a rate-limiting conformational change precedes ATP hydrolysis. On the basis of this work, we conclude that the mechanistic details of how the bacterial Hsp70 and the eukaryotic cytosolic Hsc70 couple ATP hydrolysis to structural transitions are different. Single turnover experiments on bovine Hsc70 have revealed the same two-step mechanism as shown in Reaction 2 (14Ha J.-H. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11635-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, the rate-limiting step for this eukaryotic cytosolic Hsc70 is not the first step, ATP hydrolysis, it is the second step, product release. This mechanistic difference is probably related in some way to the fact that the bacterial Hsp70 chaperone DnaK depends on the cochaperones DnaJ and GrpE to accelerate ATP hydrolysis and ADP release, respectively, whereas the eukaryotic cytosolic Hsc70 chaperone is GrpE-independent (26Stuart R.A. Cyr D.M. Craig E.A. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 87-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 27Hohfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although the cross-linking results in this report were interpreted in terms of Model 1, there are two reasons why Model 2 should not be discarded. First, a genetically engineered COOH-terminal fragment of DnaK, with a peptide in the binding site, crystallizes in two different forms (8Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). In one crystal form the α-helical lid blocks the deep peptide binding channel, while in the other crystal form the α-helical lid is rotated away from the channel, making the channel more accessible. Possibly, these two different crystals represent the two different E state isomers. Second, hexokinase, which has an ATP and glucose binding core that is identical in tertiary structure to the ATP-binding core of 70-kDa molecular chaperones (4Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), equilibrates between closed and open forms in the absence of glucose (28Anderson C.M. Stenkamp R.E. McDonald R.C. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 123: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Hoggett J.G. Kellett G.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Given the similar tertiary structures of hexokinase and the 70-kDa chaperones, it is reasonable to postulate that the ATPase domain of 70-kDa chaperones also equilibrates between closed and open forms in the absence of substrates, as indicated in Model 2. Clearly, more experiments are required before the presence of the two monomers bands can be definitively assigned to a specific model. Last, we address one other interpretation of the gel results. Suppose that the high affinity species, which migrates as the apparent molecular mass 90-kDa species after cross-linking, and the low affinity species, which migrates as the 70-kDa species after cross-linking, are in equilibrium in the absence of ATP, the equilibrium lies to the low affinity state, and ATP binding shifts the equilibrium completely to the low affinity state. Specifically, suppose that 30% of the DnaK molecules populate the high affinity state and 70% of the DnaK molecules populate the low affinity state in the absence of ATP; cross-linking such a sample would yield a doublet, exactly as shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, because ATP binding shifts the equilibrium to the low affinity state, cross-linking would yield a singlet, exactly as shown in Fig. 2. In this interpretation of the gel data, polypeptide binding should shift the population of molecules from the low affinity to the high affinity state. But we have been unable to cause such a shift by incubating DnaK with a large excess of peptide and then cross-linking. In addition, the idea that DnaK predominantly populates the low affinity state in the absence of ATP also contradicts results from structural (12Wilbanks S.M. Chen L. Tsuruta H. Hodgson K.O. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12095-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Shi L. Kataoka M. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and kinetic (15Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) studies, which have shown that in the absence of ATP 70-kDa chaperone molecules populate the high affinity state. We believe the best explanation of the gel results is Model 1, where in the absence of ATP all DnaK molecules populate the high affinity state, which happens to cross-link heterogeneously. Whichever model turns out to be correct, the low affinity to high affinity structural transition in DnaK molecules occurs at exactly the same rate as DnaK-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, consistent with Reaction 2."
https://openalex.org/W1528155750,"The high affinity interactions of phosducin with G-proteins involve binding of phosducin to the G-protein betagamma subunits. Here we have investigated whether phosducin interacts also with G-protein alpha subunits. Interactions of phosducin with the individual subunits of Go were measured by retaining phosducin-G-protein subunit complexes on columns containing immobilized anti-phosducin antibodies. Both the alpha and the beta subunits of trimeric Go were specifically retained by the antibodies in the presence of phosducin. This binding was almost completely abolished for both subunits following protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of phosducin and was reduced, more for alpha than for beta subunits, by the stable GTP analog guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate. Isolated alphao was also retained on the columns in the presence of phosducin but not in the presence of protein kinase A-phosphorylated phosducin. Likewise, purified G-protein betagamma subunit complexes as well as purified alpha subunits of Go and Gt were precipitated together with His6-tagged phosducin with nickel-agarose; this co-precipitation occurred concentration-dependently, with apparent affinities for phosducin of 55 nM (Gbetagamma), 110 nM (alphao), and 200 nM (alphat). In functional experiments, the steady state GTPase activity of isolated alphao was inhibited by phosducin by approximately 60% with an IC50 value of approximately 300 nM, whereas the GTPase activity of trimeric Go was inhibited by approximately 90% with an IC50 value of approximately 10 nM. Phosducin did not inhibit the GTP-hydrolytic activity of isolated alphao as measured by single-turnover assays, but it inhibited the release of GDP from alphao; the rate constant of GDP release was decreased approximately 40% by 500 nM phosducin, and the inhibition occurred with an IC50 value for phosducin of approximately 100 nM. These data suggest that phosducin binds with high affinity to G-protein betagamma subunits and with lower affinity to G-protein alpha subunits. We propose that the alpha subunit-mediated effects of phosducin might increase both the extent and the rapidity of its inhibitory effects compared with an action via the betagamma subunit complex alone."

One recently discovered protein post-translational modification in eukaryotic organisms is protein isoprenylation (1Glomset J.A. Gelb M.H. Farnsworth C.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 139-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 2Gibbs J.B. Cell. 1991; 65: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Protein isoprenylation is the first in a series of post-translational modifications which serve to increase the hydrophobicity of the modified proteins, producing membrane association for proteins that otherwise lack membrane binding structures (3Ghomashchi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11910-11918Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 4Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Prenylated proteins are modified by either a 15-carbon isoprenoid, farnesyl, or a 20-carbon isoprenoid, geranylgeranyl. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the modified proteins serves to direct the addition of either of these isoprenoids. Three general classes of COOH-terminal sequences serve as substrates for the protein prenyltransferases. The first class comprises those that conform to the consensus sequence -CAAX, where C is cysteine, a is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is Ala, Cys, Glu, Met, Ser, or Val (5Moores S.H. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins ending in -CAAXsequences which are modified with farnesyl include the mammalian H-Ras (CVLS), K-Ras (CVIM), and lamin B (CAIM) well as the yeast a-factor (CVIA), Ras1p (CIIC), Ras2p (CIIS), and Rho4p (CIIM) proteins. The second class is that of proteins that terminate in the consensus sequence CAAL, which includes such proteins as the yeast Rho2p (CIIL), Rsr1p (CTIL), and Rho1p (CVLL) proteins. The third class of COOH-terminal motifs includes the sequence -CC or -CXC found in the Rab family GTPases, which are double geranylgeranylated. Two additional modifications follow the isoprenylation of -CAAX and -CAAL proteins. The COOH-terminal tripeptide is endoproteolyzed, and the exposed isoprenyl-cysteine is carboxylmethylated. Isoprenylation and the subsequent carboxylmethylation serve to increase the hydrophobicity of the modified protein, allowing it to associate physically with intracellular membranes (4Parish C.A.

The conservation of enzyme structure and substrate preferences of these enzymes suggests that they share a common catalytic mechanism.

Substrate overlap between FTase and GGTase-I is particularly evident with substrate proteins that terminate in CIIM; these substrates are geranylgeranylated by both FTase and GGTase-I (20Caplin B.E. Hettich L.A. Marshall M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). FTase can farnesylate protein substrates ending in the sequence CIIL, and GGTase-I farnesylates the yeast RhoB, which has a carboxyl-terminal CKVL sequence (21Armstrong S.A. Hannah V.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7864-7868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Yeast FTase and GGTase-I enzymes also show substrate overlap in vivo, where Ras proteins in yeast that lacks FTase are farnesylated by GGTase-I, and yeast that lacks GGTase-I has a faster growth rate when FTase is overexpressed (19Trueblood C.E. Ohya Y. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4260-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of both the α and β subunits of FTase indicates that each subunit plays a role in enzymatic catalysis (22Andres D.A. Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1383-1390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ohya Y. Caplin B.E. Qadota H. Tibbetts M.F. Anraku Y. Pringle J.R. Marshall M.S. Mol. Gen.

The α subunit is important for stabilization of the heterodimer and may also directly affect the catalytic reaction (25Park H.-W. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.S. Science. 1997; 257: 1800-1804Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of a Zn2+-coordinating Cys residue in the β subunit of FTase indicates a role for this subunit in isoprenoid binding and a direct role in enzymatic catalysis (26Fu H. Moomaw J.F. Moomaw C.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28541-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity cross-linking of peptides to FTase indicates the presence of an intersubunit location for the catalytic active site (27Ying W. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Cai K. Aloise P. Coleman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 470-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Pellicena P. Scholten J.D. Zimmerman K. Creswell M. Huang C.C. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13494-13500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Further studies of the FTase β subunit indicate that distinct NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regions of this subunit are involved in determining the -CAAX specificity of this enzyme and that single site mutations are sufficient to produce a mutant FTase that has an increased affinity for -CAAL substrates (29Villar K.D. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The results from these and other studies suggest that the FTase β subunit determines both isoprenoid and protein substrate specificities. This is supported logically by the fact that their β subunits are the only difference between the FTase and GGTase-I enzymes. For this study it was hypothesized that regions highly conserved among eukaryotic FTase β subunits that differed from the known GGTase-I β subunits contained the residues that determined a preference for farnesyl pyrophosphate and CAA(A,S,C,M) over CAAL. Seven such regions and individual residues were identified in the yeast FTase β subunit which met these criteria. Each site was changed from the yeast FTase β subunit sequence to the corresponding yeast GGTase-I β subunit amino acid sequence. Mutations affecting residues 74, 206–212, and 351–354 in the β subunit altered -CAAX and isoprenoid specificity upon reconstitution with the α subunit. The ram1p-351FSKN FTase was surprising in that rather than behaving more like the GGTase-I, it was found to behave as a dogmatic FTase: able to farnesylate only non-leucine-ending -CAAXproteins and unable to geranylgeranylate any substrate tested. Expression and analysis of the ram1p-351FSKN mutant enzyme in ram1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast lacking the wild type β subunit of the FTase strongly suggested that the loose substrate specificity observed for FTase in vitro and in vivo does not play a critical physiological function in S. cerevisiae.

Mutations will be referred to by the amino acid changes produced in the Ram1 protein, for example the R57HV60FL61FS63RV64H changes will be referred to as Ram1p-57HFFRH. All RAM1 mutagenic oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Oligo 1000 DNA Synthesizer from Beckman Instruments Inc. The yeast shuttle vector YCP50-ADH containing a 5′-EcoRI cloning site and a 3′-XbaI cloning site was designed to express the RAM1, RAM1-351FSKN, and RAM1-74D genes with a constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. Plasmids YCP50-ADH-RAM1, YCP50-ADH-RAM1-351FSKN, and YCP50-ADH-RAM1-74D were produced by subcloningEcoRI/XbaI fragments of the appropriate vectors according to the method of Maniatis et al. (38Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: I.53-I.73Google Scholar). The identity of the vectors was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion with EcoRI and XbaI enzymes and dideoxy sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Sequenase version 2.0). Coexpression of each protein prenyltransferase was accomplished by the cotransformation of E. coli strain DH5α with 0.1 μg each of pBH57 (pRAM2) and pMLM4 (pCDC43), pMM101–3 (pRAM1), pBC27–3 (pRAM1-57HFFRH), pBC22–81 (pRAM1-74D), pBC26–13 (pRAM1-206DDLF), pBC25–7 (pRAM1-308T), pBC30–5 (pRAM1-351FSKN), pBC21–41 (pRAM1-367G), or pBC24–8 (pRAM1-385K)(32) and selection on Luria Broth plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin and 10 mg/ml chloramphenicol. Recombinant FTase and GGTase-I enzyme expression in E. coliand cell lysate preparation was performed as described previously (20Caplin B.E. Hettich L.A. Marshall M.S. Biochim. Biophys.

Kinetic studies were performed with purified wild type and ram1p-351FSKN FTases using 0.5–20 μmRas-CII(S,M) or 1.0–38 μm Ras-CIIL for protein substrates and 0.021–20 mm [3H]-Fpp or [3H]-GGpp. In a standard FTase assay, the reaction was terminated after 10 min by the addition of 0.9 ml of 1 mHCl in ethanol. After protein precipitation for 15 min at room temperature, samples were slow filtered over pre-wet Whatman GF/F filters and washed four times with 2-ml volumes of 100% ethanol. Filters were air dried and scintillation counted in 5 ml of BioSafe II liquid scintillation mixture. Time course assays for both the wild type and ram1p-351FSKN FTases with each substrate combination were performed to determine the appropriate incubation times necessary to acquire initial rate values. Kinetic data were collected from at least four separate experiments for each substrate. Steady-state kinetic parameters were determined by fit to an ordered Bi-Bi steady-state reaction mechanism using GraFit version 3.02 (Erithacus Software, Inc., 1996).

Protein expression and cell pellets were obtained according to the protocol outlined above. Cell pellets were resuspended into 10 ml of purification lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm ZnCl2, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mmleupeptin, 0.1 μm pepstatin A) and lysed by sonication using five 30-s pulses with a Fisher model 300 sonicator at 35% power. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × gat 4 °C. Cleared lysates were loaded onto three sequential 5-ml Econo Q columns (Bio-Rad) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The columns were washed with TDZ buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μmZnCl2). The column was eluted with a 10% step gradient from 0 to 100% TDZN buffer (TDZ buffer plus 1 m NaCl). Prenyltransferase activity eluted in the 200–500 mm NaCl fractions. The active fractions were pooled and concentrated in Amicon Centriprep 10 concentrators. Wild type FTase and ram1p-351FSKN FTase enzyme purification was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Coomassie Brilliant Blue (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) staining, and Bio-Rad Bradford protein analysis. The wild type FTase and the ram1p-351FSKN FTase enzymes prepared by Econo Q purification were prepared for Glu-Glu-Phe immunoaffinity purification adapted from Refs. 12Mayer M.P. Prestwich G.D.

Concentrated active fractions from Econo Q columns were diluted with TDZE (TDZ + 0.1 mm EDTA) to bring the final salt concentration to 100 mm NaCl. Protease inhibitors were added (0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 0.1 μm pepstatin A) (YL1/2 loading buffer). The active fraction was loaded onto a Gamma Bind Plus/YL1/2 antibody column at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min in a continuous loop overnight at 4 °C. The preparation of this column has been described elsewhere (12Mayer M.P. Prestwich G.D. Dolence J.M. Milano P.D. Wu H. Poulter C.D. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The column was washed with 10 volumes of TDZE at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Column elution was achieved with YL1/2 elution buffer (TDZ + 5 mm Asp-Phe dipeptide; Sigma) at 0.1 ml/min; fractions were 0.5-ml volumes. The active fractions were assayed by the method of Bradford (Bio-Rad) for protein content and by filter binding prenyltransferase assays for activity. Active fractions were dialyzed at 4 °C, in 250 ml of 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μmZnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% glycerol. The dialysate was separated into 0.05-ml aliquots and flash frozen in N2 (liquid) and stored at −80 °C until ready for use. The presence of prenyltransferase was confirmed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and a combination of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and Western blot analysis with YL1/2 (anti-tubulin (EEF)) primary antibody and Amersham horseradish peroxidase (anti-rat) secondary antibody. The presence of immunoreactive bands was determined by ECL detection (Amersham). Purified enzymes were used for Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis as described above. Yeast cells YO2A, YO4D, YO3C, and YO5C were transformed by the lithium acetate method (CLONTECH). YO3C and YO5C cells are each transformed with pMJ13 (YCP50-ADH), pBC31 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1-351FSKN), pBC32 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1), or pBC33 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1-74D). Transformants were selected on SD-Ura plates at 30 °C to produce strains BC3CY (YCP50-ADH, MATa), BC3CY31 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1-351FSKN, MATa), BC3CY32 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1, MATa), BC3CY33 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1–74D, MATa), BC5CY (YCP50-ADH, MATα), BC5CY31 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1–351FSKN, MATα), BC5CY32 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1, MATα), BC5CY33 (YCP50-ADH-RAM1–74D, MATα). Transformants were grown in 5 ml of SD-Ura selective medium overnight at 30 °C, 200 rpm. The cell number was determined by counting with a hemacytometer. These overnight cultures were used to inoculate cultures for growth curves. 1 × 106 cells of each transformant were seeded in 25 ml of SD-Ura broth. Cultures were grown at either 28 or 35 °C, 300 rpm, and 0.8-ml samples were collected. Cell growth was determined by measuring A600 at indicated time points. The cell number was determined by hemacytometry and was found to be linear with respect to optical density. Mating assays consisted of BC3CY, BC3CY31, BC3CY32, and BC3CY33 cells (MATa) each mated to PT1 cells (MATα). Briefly, an equal number of MATa cells, which had been sonicated to separate individual cells, was mixed with a 10-fold excess of MATα cells and filtered onto individual nitrocellulose filters. MATa and MATα cells on filters were incubated on YPD plates for 4 h at 30 °C. After incubation cells were diluted in minimal media and sonicated. Mated cells were plated onto minimal agar plates. Revertant controls were subjected to the same conditions as the mated cells, and the cell number control experiments were plated onto minimal agar plates with nutrients adenine (20 mg/ml), lysine (30 mg/ml), tryptophan (20 mg/ml), and histidine (20 mg/ml).

The β subunits of FTase and GGTase-I sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL version 1.6 multiple sequence alignment program (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston). A visual search strategy was employed to identify amino acid residues potentially important for determining the unique substrate preferences of the two enzymes. Briefly, amino acid residues conserved between both enzymes were presumed to be necessary for the tertiary structure of the enzymes. Amino acid residues specifically conserved in only the FTase or the GGTase-I β subunits, but not conserved for both enzymes, were hypothesized to determine the distinct substrate specificities of the two enzymes. Seven such regions or individual residues were identified and selected for mutagenesis. The amino acid residues of the yeast FTase Ram1p β subunit were substituted with the corresponding residues of the yeast Cdc43p GGTase-I β subunit. The following RAM1 mutants were prepared: RAM1-57HFFRH, RAM1-74D, RAM1-206DDLF, RAM1-308T, RAM1-351FSKN, RAM1-367G, and RAM1-385K. The result of this search strategy and the substitutions made in the FTase enzyme are depicted in Fig. 1. The conserved sequences that met the criteria of the search strategy generally were found to be embedded within the context of short stretches of conservation for both the FTase and GGTase-I enzymes. Recombinant wild type FTase was expressed in E. coli, and the bacterial lysate was assayed for its ability to farnesylate or geranylgeranylate the Ras-CIIS, Ras-CIIM, and Ras-CIIL proteins (Fig. 2). The wild type FTase enzyme efficiently farnesylated Ras-CIIS, Ras-CIIM, and Ras-CIIL and also geranylgeranylated Ras-CIIM (31Caplin B.E. Marshall M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 51-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The quantity of [3H]farnesyl and [3H]geranylgeranyl incorporated into each Ras substrate by the wild type FTase under standardized conditions was determined by time course assays to represent the initial rate of reaction and was considered the 100% control value for comparison with the mutant FTase enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W2078913466,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal11, a component of the holoenzyme of RNA polymerase II, interacts through its functional domains A and B with the small (Tfa2) and large (Tfa1) subunits of the general transcription factor (TF) IIE, respectively. We have recently suggested that Gal11 functions through a common pathway with TFIIE in transcriptional regulation (Sakurai, H., and Fukasawa, T. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 32663–32669). Here, we report that the activity of the TFIIH-associated kinase, responsible for phosphorylation of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II at the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD), is enhanced cooperatively by Gal11 and TFIIE. The enhancement of CTD phosphorylation was observed in the holoenzyme of RNA polymerase II, but not in its core enzyme. The stimulatory effect was completely abolished in the absence of either domain B of Gal11 or the Tfa1 subunit of TFIIE, suggesting that the domain B-Tfa1 interaction is necessary, if not sufficient, for an extensive phosphorylation of the CTD by TFIIH. Stimulation of basal transcription by Gal11 was coupled with enhancement of TFIIH-catalyzed CTD phosphorylation in a cell-free transcription system, suggesting that Gal11 activates transcription by stimulating the CTD phosphorylation in the cell."

Chemical modification experiments with diethyl pyrocarbonate have identified the conserved residue His-143 as essential for catalysis in this enzyme and the pKa for this modification is also 6.2, implying that this is the single ionizing residue in dehydroquinase that may be acting as a general base in the catalytic mechanism. Subsequent mutagenesis of this residue (Leech, A. P., James, R., Coggins, J. R., and Kleanthous, C. (1995) J. Biol.

The importance of this residue was confirmed by recent x-ray crystallographic data showing His-143 to be at the center of a hydrogen-bonded triad, flanked by the essential Schiff base forming residue Lys-170 and Glu-86. In the present study, we have used mutagenesis and 1H and 13C NMR to assign the resonance of His-143 and probe its ionization state to define more precisely its role in the mechanism of type I dehydroquinase. Following isotopic enrichment of wild-type and H143A dehydroquinase enzymes with [2-13C]histidine, the resonance for His-143 was assigned by comparing their 1H,13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra. pH titrations revealed that whether in the liganded or unliganded state, His-143 does not ionize over the pH range 6–9.5 and so cannot possess a pKa of 6.2. The NMR data are consistent with this residue remaining unprotonated at pH values optimal for the activity of this enzyme (pH > 7).

The dehydration of 3-dehydroquinic acid to 3-dehydroshikimic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-dehydroquinase (DHQase 1The abbreviations used are: DHQase, 3-dehydroquinase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. ; EC 4.2.1.10) and occurs in two metabolic contexts, the biosynthetic shikimate pathway and the degradative quinate pathway. In a biosynthetic background, the enzyme introduces a double bond into the hexane ring of the substrate molecule, which is then converted through several enzymatic steps to produce the central metabolite, chorismic acid. From this precursor, numerous aromatic compounds are made including the aromatic amino acids, ubiquinone and vitamin E. The shikimate pathway is found in all prokaryotes and in lower eukaryotes such as fungi and plants but not in mammals and so is recognized as a source of potential targets for antimicrobial agents and herbicides (1Kishore G.M. Shah D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 627-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). In a catabolic background, dehydroshikimate is further aromatized to produce protocatechuic acid that goes on to be metabolized to acetyl-CoA through the β-ketoadipate pathway (2Giles N.H. Partridge C.W.H. Ahmed S.I. Case M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1930-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

Unlike the serine proteases (the best known example of convergent evolution), which have evolved from different ancestors to yield enzymes that catalyze the same chemical reaction by the same mechanism, dehydroquinases have evolved from different ancestors to catalyze the same chemical reaction by completely different mechanisms. Moreover, the structure and properties of the two types of DHQase are also different. Indeed, the only point of convergence for this class of enzyme is the dehydration reaction itself. It is therefore of great mechanistic and evolutionary interest to study the structure and mechanism of dehydroquinase enzymes to understand how this situation has arisen. Both types have been found in shikimate and quinate pathways, although there remain few examples of a type I DHQase in a quinate background, showing that the metabolic context of the reaction does not play a role in defining which class of DHQase is utilized (6Bottomley J.R. Clayton C.L. Chalk P.A. Kleanthous C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Type I enzymes (typified by the enzyme from E. coli) are dimers of 25-kDa monomeric molecular mass, are heat labile (denaturing above 60 °C), and catalyze the dehydration of dehydroquinate by a Schiff base mechanism (5Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By contrast, type II enzymes (typified by the enzyme from Anacystis nidulans) are dodecamers of 16–18-kDa monomeric molecular mass, are very resistant to heat denaturation (>80 °C), and do not catalyze the dehydration reaction by a Schiff base mechanism but seem to go via an enediolate intermediate (5Kleanthous C. Deka R. Davis K. Kelly S.M. Cooper A. Harding S.E. Price N.C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Harris J.M. Gonzalez-Bello C. Kleanthous C. Hawkins A.R. Coggins J.R. Abell C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Another important mechanistic difference between the two types of DHQase is the stereochemistry of the elimination reaction which is syn for the E. coli type I enzyme (8Hanson K.R. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1963; 50: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) but anti for the A. nidulans type II enzyme (9Harris J.M. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 1993: 1080-1081Crossref Google Scholar). Diffracting crystals of both types of DHQase have been obtained, the type II enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosisand the the type I enzyme from Salmonella typhi (10Boys C.W.G. Bury S.M. Sawyer L. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,11Gourley D.G. Coggins J.R. Isaacs N.W. Moore J.D. Charles I.G. Hawkins A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 488-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Several chemical modification and mutagenesis experiments have been conducted on the type I DHQase that reveal some features of its mechanism and protein chemistry. The Schiff base-forming lysine has been identified as Lys-170 (12Chaudhuri S. Duncan K. Graham L.D. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is highly conserved in this class of enzyme. The role of the Schiff base is to act as an electron sink following proton abstraction of the C2 pro-R proton. The Schiff base may also play a role in distorting the carbocyclic ring of dehydroquinate to render the C2 pro-R proton more reactive (9Harris J.M. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. Hawkins A.R. Abell C. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1993; 1993: 1080-1081Crossref Google Scholar). Mutagenesis reveals that although a covalent adduct is formed between the enzyme and the ligand, this carbanion stabilizing moiety plays little or no role in ground state binding of substrate or product but is purely a catalytic device (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Diethyl pyrocarbonate readily inactivates the type I enzyme fromE. coli due to the modification of a single histidine residue (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although several histidine residues were modified by this reagent, the conserved residue His-143 or the neighboring nonconserved His-146 were identified as the site of inactivation. Subsequent mutagenesis of each confirmed that the conserved His-143 is essential for the catalytic mechanism, whereas His-146 does not play a role (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Deka et al. (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also found that the diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivation was very pH-dependent exhibiting a single pKa of 6.18, which is identical to the single pKa that has been determined for this enzyme from pH/log Vmax profiles (15Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The two sets of data suggest that the type I enzyme from E. coli contains a general base in the active site, most likely His-143, the role of which is to abstract the C2 proton of the substrate following Schiff base formation at Lys-170. His-143 has taken on a more enigmatic role following the characterization of the mutant in which this residue had been substituted for alanine (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The activity of the H143A mutant is certainly compromised as would be expected for a critical active site residue (kcat∼105-106-fold lower than that of wild type). However, the mutant is more affected in its ability to hydrolyze the product Schiff-base than it is in turning over the substrate to product. Indeed, this final hydrolysis step is rate-limiting for the H143A mutant, producing burst kinetics under steady-state conditions. The H143A mutant is thus able to slowly convert substrate to product but is severely hampered in its ability to hydrolyze the product Schiff base, a phenomenon we have termed “stalled catalysis” (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is strikingly illustrated by the fact that the H143A enzyme as purified from overexpressing bacterial cells contains the bound product dehydroshikimate at the active site and this has to be subsequently removed by treatment with hydroxylamine. These results imply that His-143 is involved in Schiff base formation/hydrolysis as well as possibly playing a role in proton abstraction. Leech et al. (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) hypothesized that it could be involved in both the formation of the Schiff base as a general acid and as a general base in the subsequent proton-abstracting step. The structure for the borohydride-reduced product bound form of type IS. typhi enzyme (which is ∼80% identical to the E. coli enzyme; Ref. 16Moore J.D. Hawkins A.R. Charles I.G. Deka R. Coggins J.R. Cooper A. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) has recently been solved at 2.5 Å resolution. 2A. K. Shrive and L. Sawyer, unpublished observations. The structure shows His-143 to lie at the center of a hydrogen-bonded triad linking Lys-170 and Glu-86 (Fig. 1), which is consistent with a role in Schiff base formation but not that originally proposed, rather one in which it deprotonates the Schiff base-forming lysine. However, it remains unclear from the structure if His-143 could go on to participate in general base catalysis in the subsequent elimination reaction. The ionization state of His-143 is central to our understanding of the mechanism of type I DHQases, and so we set out to determine the ionization behavior of this residue in both unliganded and liganded states. We present 1H and 13C NMR experiments aimed at assigning the resonance of His-143 and which report its ionization state in the active site of the enzyme. Ammonium 3-dehydroquinate was prepared by the method of Grewe and Haendler (17Grewe R. Haendler H. Biochem. Prep. 1968; 12: 21-26Google Scholar). Hydroxylamine hydrochloride was from Sigma. [2-13C]histidine was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Promochem). Other chemicals were of reagent grade or better and used without further purification. These procedures have been described by Leech et al. (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In all instances protein was determined to be essentially pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and structural integrity of each polypeptide, especially that of the H143A mutant, was verified by electrospray mass spectrometry as described previously (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Following the purification of H143A DHQase, endogenously bound product was removed by dialyzing the protein against 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 50 mm hydroxylamine followed by a final dialysis against 50 mm potassium phosphate. Borohydride reduction of product at the active site of wild-type DHQase was carried out as described by Leech et al. (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein concentration determinations were carried out by the method of Bradford using a kit from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as a standard (18Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar) and by spectrophotometry using the extinction coefficient ε280 = 19,000 at 280 nm (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dehydroquinase activity was assayed by monitoring the appearance of product by spectrophotometry at 234 nm as described previously (15Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The plasmids pAL2, pAL5G, and pAL17 expressing wild-type, H143A, and H146A DHQases, respectively, were transformed into E. coli strain ATC1360 (Δ(gpt-proA)62, lacY1, tsx-29, supE44, galk2, λ−,aro D6, his G4(oc), xyl-5, mtl-1, argE3, thi-1) obtained from the E. coli genetic stock center. A 50-ml seed flask of M9 minimal medium supplemented with arginine, proline (100 μg/ml), [2-13C]histidine (40 μg/ml), thiamine (10 μg/ml), and ampicillin (200 μg/ml) was inoculated from a glycerol stock and grown for approximately 24 h. For the H143A protein preparations the medium was also supplemented with 200 μg/ml shikimic acid. This culture was then used to inoculate 500-ml flasks of the same medium, which were grown toA550 of 0.5, whereupon isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and growth continued for about 18 h. The labeled protein was purified as described previously (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein purified by fast protein liquid chromatography was dialyzed against 1 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and lyophilized to dryness. The powder was redissolved in potassium phosphate buffer made up in D2O to give final protein concentrations of about 6–8 mg/ml and 50 mm phosphate. Samples were centrifuged briefly before NMR experiments. pH titrations were performed using small quantities of KOD or DCl in D2O, generally toward alkaline pH values to avoid precipitation; pH values were determined directly in the NMR tubes using a combination microelectrode calibrated with appropriate reference buffers. Since the effect of D2O on the electrode and on the pKa of histidine cancel almost completely, uncorrected meter readings are reported (19Sachs D.H. Schechter A.N. Cohen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6576-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR experiments were conducted on a Varian Unity INOVA system at a1H frequency of 600 MHz (13C 150 MHz) using a 5-mm broadband inverse detection probe. The pH dependence of the C2 carbon of histidine residues at 298 K was monitored via1H,13C HSQC experiments (20Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.F. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar). The GARP sequence (21Shaka A.J. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Res. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar) was used for 13C broadband decoupling during acquisition and the HDO signal of the solvent was suppressed by presaturation. Quadrature detection in F1 was achieved using the method of States et al. (22States D.J. Haberhorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Res. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar). All two-dimensional experiments were recorded as 32 × 2048 complex matrices with sweep widths of 1250 Hz in F1 (13C) and 7500 Hz in F2 (1H) with 64 transients per increment resulting in a total measuring time of 41 min per experiment. All processing was performed using VNMR 5.3 or Felix 95 (MSI) software. Data in F1 were zero-filled to 1024 complex data points leading to a digital resolution of 1.2 Hz/point in F1 and 3.7 Hz/point in F2. A squared sinebell window, shifted by π/2, or exponential line-broadening was used in one or both dimensions. Chemical shifts were referenced to the methyl resonance of sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionate at 0 ppm. NMR is ideally suited to the determination of residue pKa values in proteins (23Jardetzky O. Roberts G.C.K. NMR in Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). Since the C2 proton of histidine residues lies in the aromatic region of 1H NMR spectra it is sometimes possible to follow the ionization changes of a histidine residue by observing this signal without resorting to isotope enrichment methods. At 55 kDa, the type I DHQase dimer is a large protein by NMR standards but successful determinations of histidine pKa values for proteins of this size have been reported previously (24Perutz M.F. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Fogg J.H. Shih D.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Samples of type I DHQase were dialyzed into D2O/phosphate buffer (as described under “Materials and Methods”) and one-dimensional 1H spectra collected at 600 MHz (Fig. 2). The aromatic region of the wild-type spectrum indicates many sharp and broad resonances superimposed on a bank of nonexchanged amide protons. To assign the resonance for the essential active site histidine residue His-143, we compared the wild-type spectrum to that of the H143A mutant (Fig. 2,bottom and middle, respectively). In addition, we also analyzed samples of the H146A mutant (which is fully active) as a control (Fig. 2, top). Histidine C2 protons reside downfield of the bulk of the aromatic resonances (6.5–7.5 ppm). No clear differences could be seen however for H143A in this region by comparison with the wild-type protein but an unambiguous assignment could be made for the sharp resonance at 7.9 ppm as that from His-146. pH titrations of these samples (over the range 6–8) also failed to provide any evidence for the loss of a peak in the H143A mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme but did reveal that His-146 in type I DHQase has a pKa of 6.86 ± 0.02 (data not shown). The significance of this observation is discussed later. Ligand binding can perturb residue chemical shifts and so one-dimensional1H spectra were obtained for wild-type, H143A, and H146A following covalent attachment of the product dehydroshikimate to the Schiff base-forming lysine by borohydride reduction (25Kleanthous C. Reilly M. Cooper A. Kelly S. Price N.C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas some perturbations could be seen in the wild-type spectrum, identical changes were observed in the mutant spectra (data not shown). Thus, even after irreversible attachment of product to the active site, the1H resonance for His-143 could not be obtained by comparison to the alanine mutant. Isotopic enrichment of proteins with NMR isotopes, 15N or 13C, makes the identification and study of individual residues in large proteins a tractable and useful approach when attempting to define their ionization state (26Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules. IRL Press, Oxford1993Google Scholar). 15N, for example, has been particularly useful in the analysis of histidine residues in the catalytic triad of serine proteases (27Bachovchin W.W. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7751-7759Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and triosephosphate isomerase (28Lodi P.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6948-6956Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 13C NMR has also been used to study proteins such as the serine proteases (29Bachovchin W.W. Kaiser R. Richards J.H. Roberts J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7323-7326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Even for a protein as large as the catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase (100 kDa), information on the ionization state of an active site histidine residue was obtained by13C amino acid enrichment in combination with13C NMR (30Kleanthous C. Wemmer D.E. Schachman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13062-13067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, type I DHQase was enriched with13C2-labeled histidine using E. coli ATC1360, a bacterial strain auxotrophic for histidine (see “Materials and Methods”). Preliminary studies demonstrated that the level of histidine required to establish a good yield of cell paste and achieve a high level of expression on induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in defined medium was 40 μg/ml. By comparison with the normal levels of expression that are achieved using E. coli ATC1360 in rich medium (100 mg/liter culture), the yields on minimal medium under these conditions were 20 mg/liter culture. Wild-type and both histidine mutants (H143A and H146A) were isotopically enriched by this procedure, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed into phosphate buffer. One problem that was encountered in these studies was the limited solubility of the E. coli type I DHQase; the highest concentration that could be achieved was 8 mg/ml (0.29 mm subunit concentration). Concentrations greater than this were viscous and tended to precipitate (data not shown). Nevertheless, these samples were sufficient to obtain reasonable NMR spectra for the two proteins. The site of the 13C-label in our experiments was at the C2 position, which is ideally placed to signal changes in ionization state. C4-labeled [13C]histidine is also a good probe of histidine ionizations. In combination with proton decoupling to reduce line broadening, direct detection of the 13C nucleus is possible with either probe. However, indirect detection of a13C nucleus coupled to protons offers a very sensitive method for observing such sites in proteins. We therefore compared1H,13C HSQC spectra of wild-type with both H146A DHQase (Fig. 3 A) and H143A DHQase (Fig. 3 B) in an attempt to assign their resonances. Wild-type DHQase has 6 histidine residues and from the appropriate region of the spectrum (7–9 ppm, 1H dimension; 134–136 ppm 13C dimension) it can be seen that six resonances are clearly identified, the strongest of which corresponds to His-146, as determined from the one-dimensional 1H experiments (Fig. 2). Each of the HSQC spectra for the histidine mutants shows the loss of one cross-peak in comparison with the wild-type spectrum conducted at the same pH. The resonance for His-143 (at 7.85 ppm in the 1H dimension and 136 ppm in the13C dimension; Fig. 3 B) was the weakest in the spectrum and at certain pH levels was almost obliterated by the titrating resonance of His-146. This explains why we could not detect the loss of His-143 in the 1H experiments. These data therefore assign the 13C2-1H cross-peak from the active site histidine, His-143. To obtain complete ionization curves for histidine residues, pK values that normally range from 4 to 8, a wide spectrum of pH values should be sampled. However, at the concentrations used for the NMR experiments, type I DHQase precipitates readily at pH levels below 6 and so this represented the lowest achievable pH. pH titrations for the enzyme therefore encompassed the pH range 6–9.5, which would nevertheless detect the ionization of a residue with a pKa of 6.2, the predicted pKa for His-143 (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pH titrations for the13C resonances of labeled wild-type DHQase are shown in Fig. 4 A (very similar data were observed for the 1H resonances and so are not shown). The data demonstrate that His-143 does not titrate in the pH range 6–9.5 and so in this form of the enzyme it does not have a pKa of 6.2. Moreover, 4 of the 6 histidine residues in unliganded type I DHQase titrate in this pH range (2 of which, His-146 and peak b, were more or less complete titrations), but none of these displayed a pKa of 6.2 either. Each of the titrating peaks was fitted to a single ionizing curve described by the Henderson-Hasselbach equation; the pKa values that were determined were as follows: His-146, 6.84 (±0.05); peak a, 8.72 (±0.08); peak b, 7.61 (±0.04); peak c, 8.00 (±0.07). As for His-143, peak d did not titrate over the pH range studied. The conclusion from these data is that unliganded type I DHQase does not possess a histidine residue with a pKa of 6.2. This is at variance with the diethyl pyrocarbonate modification experiments of Deka et al. (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which showed unambiguously that the modification of His-143 inactivates the enzyme and this modification can be described by a single pKa of 6.2. Our NMR data on the unliganded enzyme therefore implies that the ionization observed in the chemical modification experiments may be that of a neighboring residue. There are several well documented examples in the literature where ligand binding alters amino acid side chain pKa values in enzyme active sites. In ribonuclease A, for example, the pKa values for the 2 essential histidine residues, which act as a general acid and as a general base, are each raised by nucleotide binding so that they acquire the appropriate charge state for catalysis to proceed (23Jardetzky O. Roberts G.C.K. NMR in Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1981Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of ligand binding on the13C-labeled histidine titration curves of DHQase (Fig. 4 B). To avoid the complexities of equilibrium binding we irreversibly linked the product dehydroshikimate to the active site of wild-type DHQase by borohydride reduction (see “Materials and Methods”). Fluorescence spectroscopy and circular dichroism measurements suggest that reduction of the product in this way does not cause any global conformational changes, but rather causes a large change in the stability of the protein (25Kleanthous C. Reilly M. Cooper A. Kelly S. Price N.C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10893-10898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The six histidine residues of each DHQase monomer are scattered throughout the protein, and since histidine pKa values are sensitive probes of their electrostatic microenvironment their behavior can also serve as indicators of changes in conformation. The titration behavior of the 6 histidine residues of wild-type DHQase following the irreversible attachment of product reinforces the view that this treatment does not cause a profound change in the conformation of the enzyme since none of the 4 titrating residues are perturbed by more than 0.1 of a pK unit; the pKa for His-146, for example, in the liganded state is 6.84, which is essentially identical to the unliganded enzyme (6.82). The only significant change that is observed as a result of the borohydride reduction of product at the active site of wild-type DHQase is that the 13C chemical shift of His-143 moves downfield by 0.6 ppm (whereas its 1H chemical shift moves downfield by 0.16 ppm). It is clear from these data that ligand binding does not cause the pKa of His-143 to rise, and indeed from its chemical shift location, the pKa for this residue is likely to be even lower in the liganded state. His-143 has been a strong candidate for the single ionizing group in type I DHQase with a pKa of 6.2 (14Deka R. Kleanthous C. Coggins J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22237-22242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chaudhuri S. Lambert J.M. McColl L.A. Coggins J.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The NMR data presented in this paper show conclusively that this ionizing group is not His-143. Indeed, none of the histidines in E. coli type I DHQase has a pKa of 6.2; the closest is His-146 which has a pKa of 6.8 in the presence or absence of ligand. Our data are consistent with a much lower pKa for His-143, likely to be <5.5 both in the liganded and unliganded states, which cannot be defined unambiguously due to problems of precipitation at low pH values. This result demonstrates that His-143 must be unprotonated at pH values at which the enzyme is most active (pH > 7). Since His-143 does not have a pKa of 6.2, and neither do any of the other histidines in type I DHQase, this ionization constant must be associated with another residue. The fact that this pKa was measured by chemical modification of His-143 suggests that a residue close to this histidine may be responsible. X-ray crystallography shows His-143 to be part of a hydrogen-bonded triad involving the Schiff base-forming lysine, Lys-170, and Glu-86 (Fig. 1), and so the question arises as to whether either of these residues could have a pKa of 6.2. The pKa of a lysine side chain is normally 10.4–11.1 (31Creighton T.E. Proteins, Structures and Molecular Properties. 2nd Ed. Freeman, 1993Google Scholar). This presents a formidable problem for Schiff base-forming enzymes which must reduce the pKa of the ε-amino group to enable nucleophilic attack of the substrate carbonyl. In the enzyme acetoacetate carboxylase, for example, this is achieved by placing another positively charged residue nearby that lowers the pKa of lysine to ∼6.0 (32Highbarger L.A. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). It is possible that the pKa of 6.2 that has been measured for type I DHQase is that of Lys-170 itself and at the present time this cannot be discounted. However, circumstantial evidence suggests that this may not be the case. Our earlier work found that when mutating (singly) Lys-170, His-143, and His-146 to alanine only the H146A mutation significantly affected the isoelectric point of the enzyme, which could be accurately measured by isoelectric focussing gel electrophoresis (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The pI of type I DHQase is 4.9 for the native enzyme (which migrates as a dimer on native isoelectric focussing gels and does not show signs of precipitation at the low concentrations of protein used) and decreases to 4.6 following mutation of His-146 to alanine. This indicates that at its isoelectric point in the enzyme, His-146 is positively charged since removing it causes the enzyme to become more acidic, which is consistent with the pKa of 6.8 that has been measured by 1H and 13C NMR. The pKa for His-143 is likely to be <5.5, which explains why the pI of the enzyme does not change on making the alanine mutation since it does not carry a full charge or is uncharged. Since the K170A mutation also does not affect the pI of the enzyme it too is likely to be either uncharged or only partially charged at the isoelectric point of the enzyme, implying that its pKa is also ≤5.5. This is an unusually low pKa for a lysine residue that, although consistent with the available data, clearly requires further analysis. The location of His-143 next to the ε-nitrogen of Lys-170 argues strongly for a role in Schiff base formation/hydrolysis. Contrary to earlier expectations, its distance from the C2 position of the ligand (albeit the product) suggests that it may not be involved in the general base-catalyzed proton abstraction of the pro-Rproton. Thus, although His-143 is clearly involved in imine formation and breakdown, its subsequent involvement in the dehydration is uncertain. The properties of the H143A mutant are consistent with this role since the mutant is compromised in its ability to hydrolyze the product Schiff base that accumulates slowly at the active site (13Leech A.P. James R. Coggins J.R. Kleanthous C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25827-25836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A logical role then for His-143 is to deprotonate the ε-NH2group of Lys-170, which would leave the imidazole group carrying a positive charge. However, since the NMR data show that His-143 is unlikely to carry a positive charge this suggests that the abstracted proton could be further shunted along the triad to Glu-86. It seems reasonable then that Glu-86 may possess the pKa of 6.2 that has been identified for type I DHQase by diethyl pyrocarbonate modification and pH/log Vmax profiles."
