https://openalex.org/W2396159587,"Recent studies (l-3) have led to a revision of the published sequence of residues 11 to 18 in bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (4). In the experiments from this laboratory (1)) the use of improved conditions for the Edman degradation (Konigsberg and Hill (5)) provided an understanding of some of the limitations inherent in the procedure employed by Hirs, Moore, and Stein (4). It was noted that difficulties can be encountered particularly in the determination of sequences of peptides containing glutamine, asparagine, serine, and threonine residues. These observations have stimulated a new examination of the amino acid sequence of the whole molecule to determine whether such complications had affected any of the conclusions drawn in regard to other parts of the chain. Experience with the stepwise degradation has resulted in the following observations: (a) When the cyclization in the Edman degradation is performed in glacial acetic acid-anhydrous HCI, a newly liberated NH*-terminal glutamine residue cyclizes to a pyrrolidone carboxylic acid residue. Since such a peptide has no a-NH2 group, the degradation cannot proceed further. (b) When the process is followed by amino acid analysis of the residual peptide (the subtractive method), an incorrect conclusion can be drawn if any artifactual decomposition of amino acids occurs during hydrolysis, as has been observed for serine and threonine (1) and tyrosine (4). (c) These difficulties are avoided by the modified conditions of Konigsberg and Hill (5), in which the cyclization is performed at 25” in anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid and the residual peptide is purified by passage through a short column of Dowex 50-X2. (d) An internal asparagine or aspartic acid residue may form an imide in glacial acetic acid-HCI at 100” (1). Since the imide opens to give predominantly the P-aspartyl peptide, the stepwise degradation cannot proceed in good yield to the next residue in the sequence. This complication is avoided when the cyclization is performed at 25”. (e) The hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine residue is nearly quantitatively acetylated in acetic acid-HCl. When such an 0-acetylated residue becomes NHe"

https://openalex.org/W2020834433,"Earlier indications that brown fat has a thermogenic role in rats exposed to cold suggested that certain comparable functions in hibernating marmots be investigated. From the results it appears that arousal of the animal by cold is induced by sympathetically activated thermogenesis in areas of brown fat so located, relative to the vasculature, that heat is transferred to the thoracic structures and cervical spinal regions."

https://openalex.org/W1976172383,"THERE is convincing evidence that bone has an orderly morphological and microscopic structure. This evidence is derived mainly from electron microscopy, ordinary histological preparations, and microradiography1. Such a structure, consisting essentially of apatite crystals embedded in an organic matrix, might be expected to exhibit piezoelectric properties, as in the case of many other multicrystalline structures."

https://openalex.org/W2076759820,"The isolated, perfused guinea pig heart contains all the catalysts required to form norepinephrine from the dietary precursor, tyrosine. The conversion of tyrosine-C14 to norepinephrine in the perfused heart occurred at a rate comparable to that estimated for this conversion in vivo. To account for the maintenance of norepinephrine stores in the normal heart, it is not necessary to postulate that the hormone is extracted from the blood."

Acute carbon tetrachloride poisoning results in depressed capacity of microsomes to incorporate amino acid. From ultracentrifugal data, there is an apparent dissociation of 79S ribosomes into 54S components."

https://openalex.org/W2073351211,Rate of extinction of the conditioned eyelid response in humans is a function of the degree of discriminability of the procedural changes that occur with shift from acquisition to extinction. Extinction is greatly retarded when these changes are minimized or the subject is distracted by another task.

https://openalex.org/W2030035828,"CERTAIN stocks of Paramecium contain cytoplasmic particles called kappa1. Kappa-bearing Paramecia (killers) are capable of killing other Paramecia (sensitives) and are resistant to the toxic agent which they produce1. The killer trait requires both the cytoplasmic particles and the dominant K gene for the maintenance of kappa, and is one of the most extensively studied examples of nucleocytoplasmic relations on a biological level2–5."

Wing-beat activity could be initiated in resting moths or amplitude augmented in active moths by x-ray dose rates of 0.01 to 1.5 roentgens per second, with a latency of less than 1 second after onset of exposure."

https://openalex.org/W2092756971,"The evidence summarized in this article is sufficient to support conclusions as follows. 1) Antibiotics penetrate rapidly into mammalian cells and inhibit multiplication of susceptible microbes within the cell as promptly and effectively as they inhibit multiplication of such microbes outside the cell. This is consistent with clinical experience. 2) Death of individual organisms inside mammalian cells bathed in medium containing antibiotics continues over several weeks but may not proceed pari passu with time. This observation supports the as yet meager clinical data, which suggest that eradication of the typhoid carrier state may be accomplished through antibiotic therapy, provided (i) the proper antibiotic is selected; (ii) it is administered in amounts sufficient to obtain continuous suppression of growth of intracellular organisms; and (iii) the regimen is maintained for 2 or 3 weeks. 3) The actual cause of death and destruction of intracellular microbes in treated cells remains an enigma. To attribute this to inanition or senescence of the organisms, without describing mechanisms, is to avoid the issue. The hypotheses dealing with inactivation of intracellular microbes by intracellular antimicrobial substances and antibodies deserve to be explored. 4) Evidence from the ward and laboratory suggests that infected cells can clear themselves of invading pathogens and recover. Although antibiotics have played the major role in demonstrating this in the laboratory, it is possible that they do nothing more than hold the intruders in abeyance while natural defense mechanisms of the cell gain the upper hand. Certainly such cellular mechanisms must provide a potent force for survival; otherwise, why would 98 percent of typhoid patients fail to become chronic carriers? 5) The continued study of infections, including the carrier state, with a view to understanding the abnormalities created by the multiplying intracellular microbe and the means by which the cell corrects these and eliminates the intruder, should open new vistas in chemotherapy and immunology."

https://openalex.org/W2021539650,"A model of permeation of living membranes is proposed in which penetration by polar molecules takes place through islands composed of limited numbers of lipoidal molecules in a state comparable to that of certain compressed monolayers. These islands are visualized as scattered within a rigid, relatively impervious matrix. Relationships for penetration of monolayers by gases have been applied to this membrane model. Calculations on this basis demonstrate that the permeabilities relative to water are described at least as well by this model as by that assuming rigid pores of 4.25 A radius."

https://openalex.org/W2059952723,"Functional relationships, available from only a few monolayer studies, can be applied to a relatively simple model of the excitable membrane to give permeability-potential curves quite similar to the conductance-potential curves obtained experimentally in voltage-clamped giant axons. Contrary to the usual view in terms of ""carrier systems,"" the present model considers the permeability to sodium and potassium to be reduced by the increase in the surface pressure induced by large lipophilic cations and anions in the outer layer of the lipoidal bimolecular leaflet constituting the living membrane; hence, the increase in permeability during depolarization, for example, is due to a decrease in the amount of the organic anions in this layer, whereas the decrease in sodium permeability during inactivation is caused by a rise in content of organic cations. The present proposal has the advantage that it is in keeping with known phenomena observed in simple physico-chemical systems as well as in excitable systems; moreover, the current actually transferred by the postulated lipophilic ions can be negligible compared to that transferred by the inorganic cations they control. The latter situation, as well as the steepness of the permeability-potential relationships obtained, have been pointed out to be critical requirements of a satisfactory molecular hypothesis."
