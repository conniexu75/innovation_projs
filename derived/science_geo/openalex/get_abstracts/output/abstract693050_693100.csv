https://openalex.org/W4229057482,"The proliferation of team-authored academic work has led to the proliferation of two kinds of authorship misconduct: ghost authorship, in which contributors are not listed as authors and honorary authorship, in which non-contributors are listed as authors. Drawing on data from a survey of 2,222 social scientists from around the globe, we study the prevalence of authorship misconduct in the social sciences. Our results show that ghost and honorary authorship occur frequently here and may be driven by social scientists' misconceptions about authorship criteria. Our results show that they frequently deviate from a common point of authorship reference (the ICMJE authorship criteria). On the one hand, they tend to award authorship more broadly to more junior scholars, while on the other hand, they may withhold authorship from senior scholars if those are engaged in collaborations with junior scholars. Authorship misattribution, even if it is based on a misunderstanding of authorship criteria rather than egregious misconduct, alters academic rankings and may constitute a threat to the integrity of science. Based on our findings, we call for journals to implement contribution disclosures and to define authorship criteria more explicitly to guide and inform researchers as to what constitutes authorship in the social sciences. Our results also hold implications for research institutions, universities, and publishers to move beyond authorship-based citation and publication rankings in hiring and tenure processes and instead to focus explicitly on contributions in team-authored publications."
https://openalex.org/W4229062925,"Breast cancer is regarded as the leading killer of women today. The early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is the key to improving the survival rate of patients. A method of breast cancer histopathological images recognition based on deep semantic features and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features is proposed in this paper. Taking the pre-trained DenseNet201 as the basic model, part of the convolutional layer features of the last dense block are extracted as the deep semantic features, which are then fused with the three-channel GLCM features, and the support vector machine (SVM) is used for classification. For the BreaKHis dataset, we explore the classification problems of magnification specific binary (MSB) classification and magnification independent binary (MIB) classification, and compared the performance with the seven baseline models of AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet50, GoogLeNet, DenseNet201, SqueezeNet and Inception-ResNet-V2. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper performs better than the pre-trained baseline models in MSB and MIB classification problems. The highest image-level recognition accuracy of 40×, 100×, 200×, 400× is 96.75%, 95.21%, 96.57%, and 93.15%, respectively. And the highest patient-level recognition accuracy of the four magnifications is 96.33%, 95.26%, 96.09%, and 92.99%, respectively. The image-level and patient-level recognition accuracy for MIB classification is 95.56% and 95.54%, respectively. In addition, the recognition accuracy of the method in this paper is comparable to some state-of-the-art methods."
https://openalex.org/W4229014846,"The rumen is a complex ecosystem that plays a critical role in our efforts to improve feed efficiency of cattle and reduce their environmental impacts. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene provides a powerful tool to survey the bacterial and some archaeal. Oral stomach tubing a cow to collect a rumen sample is a rapid, cost-effective alternative to rumen cannulation for acquiring rumen samples. In this study, we determined how sampling method (oral stomach tubing vs cannulated grab sample), as well as rumen fraction type (liquid vs solid), bias the bacterial and archaeal communities observed. Liquid samples were further divided into liquid strained through cheesecloth and unstrained. Fecal samples were also collected to determine how these differed from the rumen sample types. The abundance of major archaeal communities was not different at the family level in samples acquired via rumen cannula or stomach tube. In contrast to the stable archaeal communities across sample type, the bacterial order WCHB1-41 (phylum Kiritimatiellaeota) was enriched in both liquid strained and unstrained samples as well as the family Prevotellaceae as compared to grab samples. However, these liquid samples had significantly lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae compared with grab samples. Solid samples strained of rumen liquid most closely resembled the grab samples containing both rumen liquid and solid particles obtained directly from the rumen cannula; therefore, inclusion of particulate matter is important for an accurate representation of the rumen bacteria. Stomach tube samples were the most variable and were most representative of the liquid phase. In comparison with a grab sample, stomach tube samples had significantly lower abundance of Lachnospiraceae , Fibrobacter and Treponema . Fecal samples did not reflect the community composition of the rumen, as fecal samples had significantly higher relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae and significantly lower relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae compared with grab samples."

This descriptive cross-sectional study examined the characteristics of adolescent esports bettors and relationships between their esports betting, video gaming activities, monetary gambling participation, and at-risk/problem gambling. Two survey samples of Australians aged 12-17 years were recruited through advertisements (n = 841) and online panel providers (n = 826). In both samples, gender and parents' living situation did not differ by past-month esports cash and skin betting, but recent esports betting was associated with engaging in esports gaming activities such as playing and watching esports, and in monetary gambling activities. Past-month esports betting using cash and skins was significantly associated with at-risk/problem gambling. After controlling for recent monetary gambling, recent esports skin bettors were over 3 times more likely to meet criteria for at-risk/problem gambling. Esports betting using skins appears to pose risks for young people and is easily accessible through unlicensed operators."
https://openalex.org/W4229036704,"Methane (CH 4 ) emission from pig slurry is a large contributor to the climate footprint of livestock production. Acidification of excreta from livestock animals with sulfuric acid, reduce CH 4 emission and is practiced at many Danish farms. Possible interaction effects with other acidic agents or management practices (e.g. frequent slurry removal and residual slurry acidification) have not been fully investigated. Here we assessed the effect of pig slurry acidification with a range of organic and inorganic acids with respect to their CH 4 inhibitor potential in several batch experiments (BS). After careful selection of promising CH 4 inhibitors, three continuous headspace experiments (CHS) were carried out to simulate management of manure in pig houses. In BS experiments, more than &lt;99% CH 4 reduction was observed with HNO 3 treatment to pH 5.5. Treatments with HNO 3 , H 2 SO 4 , and H 3 PO 4 reduced CH 4 production more than acetic acid and other organic acids when acidified to the same initial pH of 5.5. Synergistic effects were not observed when mixing inorganic and organic acids as otherwise proposed in the literature, which was attributed to the high amount of acetic acid in the slurry to start with. In the CHS experiments, HNO 3 treatment reduced CH 4 more than H 2 SO 4 , but increased nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission, particularly when the acidification target pH was above 6, suggesting considerable denitrification activity. Due to increased N 2 O emission from HNO 3 treatments, HNO 3 reduced total CO 2 -eq by 67%, whereas H 2 SO 4 reduced CO 2 -eq by 91.5% compared to untreated slurry. In experiments with daily slurry addition, weekly slurry removal, and residual acidification, HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 treatments reduced CO 2 -eq by 27% and 48%, respectively (not significant). More cycles of residual acidification are recommended in future research. The study provides solid evidence that HNO 3 treatment is not suitable for reducing CO 2 -eq and H 2 SO 4 should be the preferred acidic agent for slurry acidification."
https://openalex.org/W4229012953,"Soybean is a legume crop enriched with proteins and oil. It is frequently exposed to anthropogenic and natural flooding that limits its growth and yield. Current study applied gel-free proteomic techniques to unravel soybean response mechanism to flooding stress. Two-days-old soybeans were flooded for 4 days continuously and root samples were collected at days 2 to 6 for proteomic and enzymatic analyses. Age-matched untreated soybeans were collected as control. After protein extraction, purification and tryptic digestion, the peptides were analyzed on nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 539 and 472 proteins with matched peptides 2 or more were identified in control and flooded seedlings, respectively. Among these 364 proteins were commonly identified in both control and flooded soybeans. Fourty-two protein’s abundances were changed 4-fold after 2-days of flooding stress as compared to starting point. The cluster analysis showed that highly increased proteins included cupin family proteins, enolase, pectin methylesterase inhibitor, glyoxalase II, alcohol dehydrogenase and aldolase. The enzyme assay of enolase and pectin methylesterase inhibitor confirmed protein abundance changes. These findings suggest that soybean adopts the less energy consuming strategies and brings biochemical and structural changes in the cell wall to effectively respond to flooding stress and for the survival."
https://openalex.org/W4229013820,"The death of children under-five years is one of the critical issues in public health and improving child survival continues to be a matter of urgent concern. In this paper, we assessed the proximate and socio-economics determinants of child mortality in Guinea.Using the 2018 Guinea Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS), we extracted demographic and mortality data of 4,400 children under-five years. Both descriptive and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted.Under-five mortality was 111 deaths per 1,000 live births in Guinea. The likelihood of death was higher among children born to mothers who belong to other religions compared to Christians (aOR = 2.86, 95% CI: 1.10-7.41), smaller than average children compared to larger than average children (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.28-3.04) and those whose mothers had no postnatal check-up visits after delivery (aOR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.13-2.63). Conversely, the odds of death in children with 2-3 birth rank & >2 years of birth interval compared to ≥4 birth rank and ≤2 years of birth interval were low (aOR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.83).We found that household/individual-level socioeconomic and proximate factors predict under-five mortality in Guinea. With just about a decade left to the 2030 deadline of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), concerted efforts across all key stakeholders, including government and development partners, need to be geared towards implementing interventions that target these predictors."
https://openalex.org/W4229044257,"Surveillance of Echinococcus multilocularis at the edge of its range is hindered by fragmented distributional patterns and low prevalence in definitive hosts. Thus, tests with adequate levels of sensitivity are especially important for discriminating between infected and non-infected areas. In this study we reassessed the prevalence of E. multilocularis at the southern border of its distribution in Province of Bolzano (Alto Adige, northeastern Alps, Italy), to improve surveillance in wildlife and provide more accurate estimates of exposure risk. We compared the diagnostic test currently implemented for surveillance based on coproscopy and multiplex PCR (CMPCR) to a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 235 fox faeces collected in 2019 and 2020. The performances of the two tests were estimated using a scraping technique (SFCT) applied to the small intestines of a subsample (n = 123) of the same foxes as the reference standard. True prevalence was calculated and the sample size required by each faecal test for the detection of the parasite was then estimated. True prevalence of E. multilocularis in foxes (14.3%) was markedly higher than reported in the last decade, which was never more than 5% from 2012 to 2018 in the same area. In addition, qPCR showed a much higher sensitivity (83%) compared to CMPCR (21%) and agreement with the reference standard was far higher for qPCR (0.816) than CMPCR (0.298) meaning that for the latter protocol, a smaller sample size would be required to detect the disease. Alto Adige should be considered a highly endemic area. Routine surveillance on definitive hosts at the edges of the E. multilocularis distribution should be applied to smaller geographic areas, and rapid, sensitive diagnostic tools using directly host faeces, such as qPCR, should be adopted."
https://openalex.org/W4229046611,"Pial collateral blood flow is a major determinant of the outcomes of acute ischemic stroke. This study was undertaken to determine whether retinal vessel metrics can predict the pial collateral status and stroke outcomes in patients.Thirty-five patients with acute stroke secondary to middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion underwent grading of their pial collateral status from computed tomography angiography and retinal vessel analysis from retinal fundus images.The NIHSS (14.7 ± 5.5 vs 10.1 ± 5.8, p = 0.026) and mRS (2.9 ± 1.6 vs 1.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.048) scores were higher at admission in patients with poor compared to good pial collaterals. Retinal vessel multifractals: D0 (1.673±0.028vs1.652±0.025, p = 0.028), D1 (1.609±0.027vs1.590±0.025, p = 0.044) and f(α)max (1.674±0.027vs1.652±0.024, p = 0.019) were higher in patients with poor compared to good pial collaterals. Furthermore, support vector machine learning achieved a fair sensitivity (0.743) and specificity (0.707) for differentiating patients with poor from good pial collaterals. Age (p = 0.702), BMI (p = 0.422), total cholesterol (p = 0.842), triglycerides (p = 0.673), LDL (p = 0.952), HDL (p = 0.366), systolic blood pressure (p = 0.727), HbA1c (p = 0.261) and standard retinal metrics including CRAE (p = 0.084), CRVE (p = 0.946), AVR (p = 0.148), tortuosity index (p = 0.790), monofractal Df (p = 0.576), lacunarity (p = 0.531), curve asymmetry (p = 0.679) and singularity length (p = 0.937) did not differ between patients with poor compared to good pial collaterals.This is the first translational study to show increased retinal vessel multifractal dimensions in patients with acute ischemic stroke and poor pial collaterals. A retinal vessel classifier was developed to differentiate between patients with poor and good pial collaterals and may allow rapid non-invasive identification of patients with poor pial collaterals."
https://openalex.org/W4229046735,"Diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) in children is challenging mainly due to the difficulty of obtaining respiratory specimen and lack of sensitive diagnostic tests. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert here after) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB (PTB) from stool specimen in children.A cross-sectional study was conducted among consecutively recruited children (less than 15 years old) with presumptive PTB at Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. One pulmonary specimen (expectorated sputum or gastric aspirate) was collected from each participant and tested for TB by Xpert and Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culture. In addition, one stool specimen per child was collected and tested by Xpert after a single step, centrifuge-free stool processing method adapted from KNCV TB Foundation. Diagnostic performance of Xpert was calculated with reference to LJ culture and to a composite reference standards (CRS) comprising of confirmed TB (positive by Xpert and/or culture) and unconfirmed TB (clinical diagnosis with improvement after anti-TB treatment).A total of 178 children were enrolled; 152 of whom had complete microbiological results. Overall, TB was diagnosed in 13.2% (20/152) of the children with presumptive TB. Of these, only ten had microbiologically confirmed TB (positive Xpert and/or culture) and the remaining ten were clinically diagnosed with positive response to anti-TB treatment and were classified as unconfirmed TB. Stool Xpert had sensitivity of 100% (95%CI: 66.4-100) and specificity of 99.3% (95%CI: 96.2-100) compared to culture; however, the sensitivity was decreased to 50% (95%CI: 27.2-72.8) when compared to CRS. The Xpert on gastric aspirate had sensitivity of 77.8% (95%CI: 40-97.2) compared to culture and 40% (95%CI: 19.1-64) compared to CRS.The sensitivity of Xpert for stool sample is comparable to that for gastric aspirate. Stool sample is a potential alternative to pulmonary specimen in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in children using Xpert."
https://openalex.org/W4229076968,"The advent of intraoral scanning methods has caused a paradigm shift in dentistry. However, despite their many advantages, intraoral scanners cannot accurately recognize the metallic surfaces of prothesis. Therefore, this experiment was designed to verify the effect of scanning-aid agents on the scanning accuracy using metallic reference models. Three different types of metallic reference models (inlay, onlay, and bridge) were specially designed and produced using a milling machine to simulate intraoral dental restorations. Three experimental groups (application of ScanCure, IP Scan Spray, and VITA Powder Scan Spray) were set up and scanned images (each n = 5) were acquired using the I500® intraoral scanner. The reference datasets were established by a 3D design that reflected the deviations between the measured distances and previously planned distances on the reference models. All acquired experimental datasets were digitally superimposed and compared with the reference datasets. Intragroup comparisons (precision, n = 10) were also performed. The root mean square (RMS) values of trueness in the ScanCure and IP groups were significantly more accurate than those of the VITA group in the inlay and onlay reference models (p < 0.05). Notably, in the bridge reference model, the liquid-type ScanCure group showed the highest accuracy of trueness, with statistical significance (p < 0.05). However, the RMS values of precision were not significantly different among the groups. These findings suggest that liquid-type scanning agents can be effectively used to obtain more accurate scan images of intraoral metallic dental restorations."
https://openalex.org/W4229000709,"Evidence-based practice (EBP) is the application of the best scientific evidence for clinical decision-making in professional patient care. In Ethiopia, the majority of nursing care is based on experience, tradition, intuition, common sense, and untested hypotheses. Evidence-based clinical practice has the potential to increase the quality of healthcare services while also lowering costs and increasing clinical outcomes. An institutional-based concurrent study design method of quantitative and qualitative research was conducted from Feb. 30 to Apr. 20, 2020. Systematic random sampling and purposive sampling techniques were used to select the study participants for the quantitative and qualitative analyses, respectively. To collect quantitative data, a pretested, structured, and self-administered questionnaire was used, and to collect qualitative data, an in-depth interview guided by questions was used. EBP was found to be significantly associated with educational level (AOR = 2.15, CI (1.15–4.02)), administrative support for EBP (AOR = 1.89, CI (1.22–2.91)), attitude toward EBP (AOR = 1.80, CI (1.24–2.62)), and preference of available information sources (AOR: 2.32, CI (1.58–3.39). The four main themes that emerged from the conventional content data analysis were the advantages of EBP application, barriers to EBP implementation, enabling factors for EBP, and evidence sharing. According to the findings of this study, only a few nurses used EBP at a high level. The implementation of EBP was positively associated with educational level, attitude toward EBP, administrative support, and the availability of information resources, as confirmed by the qualitative study. There must be an intervention program to facilitate the implementation of evidence in nursing practice by stakeholders to improve and increase the efficacy of practicing EBP."

The empirical results show that: (1) digital inclusive Finance can significantly improve the allocation proportion of household risk assets, promote the rational participation of households in the risk financial market, and improve the allocation efficiency of household resources. (2) Digital inclusive finance can significantly improve the income level of family financial investment and optimize family investment decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W4229080735,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of autistic young adults aged 18 to 25 years old over a 12-month transition period from 2016 to 2017. Data was collected through a longitudinal repeated measures case series design with assessments conducted at 2 time points, at baseline then 12 months later. Assessments included self-report evaluations of transition planning and intervention received at high school, engagement in post-secondary education and access to employment, living circumstances, and social support. Examination of 9 cases showed family and social support was an important facilitator of successful transition whilst low independence was a risk factor associated with unsuccessful transition. In-depth analysis of cases showed a lack of engagement in post-secondary education and unemployment were associated with poor quality of life whilst skills development, work experience placements, and support from service providers were associated with improved quality of life. Implications of the findings highlight the need for educational and socially inclusive interventions to support the heterogeneity in individual, social, communication, and behavioural challenges in autistic young adults."
https://openalex.org/W4229002976,"In Uganda, Artemether-Lumefantrine and Artesunate are recommended for uncomplicated and severe malaria respectively, but are currently threatened by parasite resistance. Genetic and epigenetic factors play a role in predisposing Plasmodium falciparum parasites to acquiring Pfkelch13 (K13) mutations associated with delayed artemisinin parasite clearance as reported in Southeast Asia. In this study, we report on the prevalence of mutations in the K13, pfmdr-2 (P. falciparum multidrug resistance protein 2), fd (ferredoxin), pfcrt (P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter), and arps10 (apicoplast ribosomal protein S10) genes in Plasmodium falciparum parasites prior to (2005) and after (2013) introduction of artemisinin combination therapies for malaria treatment in Uganda. A total of 200 P. falciparum parasite DNA samples were screened. Parasite DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA mini kit (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany) procedure. The PCR products were sequenced using Sanger dideoxy sequencing method. Of the 200 P. falciparum DNA samples screened, sequencing for mutations in K13, pfmdr-2, fd, pfcrt, arps10 genes was successful in 142, 186, 141, 128 and 74 samples respectively. Overall, we detected six (4.2%, 6/142; 95%CI: 1.4-7.0) K13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 3.9% (2/51), 4.4% (4/91) occurred in 2005 and 2013 samples respectively. All four K13 SNPs in 2013 samples were non-synonymous (A578S, E596V, S600C and E643K) while of the two SNPs in 2005 samples, one (Y588N) is non-synonymous and the other (I587I) is synonymous. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of K13 (p = 0.112) SNPs in the samples collected in 2005 and 2013. The overall prevalence of SNPs in pfmdr-2 gene was 39.8% (74/186, 95%CI: 25.1-50.4). Of this, 4.2% (4/95), 76.9% (70/91) occurred in 2005 and 2013 samples respectively. In 2005 samples only one SNP, Y423F (4.2%, 4/95) was found while in 2013, Y423F (38.5%, 35/91) and I492V (38.5%, 35/91) SNPs in the pfmdr-2 gene were found. There was a statistically significant difference in the prevalence of pfmdr-2 SNPs in the samples collected in 2005 and 2013 (p<0.001). The overall prevalence of arps10 mutations was 2.7% (2/72, 95%CI: 0.3-4.2). Two mutations, V127M (4.5%: 1/22) and D128H (4.5%: 1/22) in the arps10 gene were each found in P. falciparum parasite samples collected in 2013. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of arps10 SNPs in the samples collected in 2005 and 2013 (p = 0.238). There were more pfmdr-2 SNPs in P. falciparum parasites collected after introduction of Artemisinin combination therapies in malaria treatment. This is an indicator of the need for continuous surveillance to monitor emergence of molecular markers of artemisinin resistance and its potential drivers in malaria affected regions globally."
https://openalex.org/W4229003511,"From March 11 to April 26, 2020, the Italian government imposed a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, a quarantine that resulted in significant restrictions on the movement and social contacts of the population, with a view to limiting the pandemic outbreak. The quarantine forced people to experience distorted social distance in two contrasting ways. For some people, it resulted in social distancing and isolation, for example by separating noncohabiting couples into different dwellings. For others, however, quarantine increased and imposed social closeness, forcing couples and families into constant, daily, and prolonged cohabitation. The aim of this study was to investigate the sexual health and behaviors of Italian adults during the lockdown period using a multimethod research. An open- and a closed-ended e-questionnaire were administered immediately after the end of the lockdown. A total of 465 Italian adults completed the digital questionnaire (female = 78.7%). Participants recognized their lived sexual experience with generally positive characteristics (related to openness, unproblematic relationship with the body, and awareness and self-reflection about one's sexuality), while negative thoughts such as worry and pain were quite scarce. Participants with a disability (5.6%) showed a marked inversion compared to the mean of respondents, recognizing themselves mainly in negative thoughts related to low self-esteem, inadequacy, and feelings of suffering, yet reporting a higher than mean level of arousal. In the qualitative analysis, the Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) index was computed to measure the salience of the word used by participants to respond to the open-ended five questions. It revealed a generally depressed emotional experience associated with the experience of lockdown, both in terms of desire, which seemed to be shifted more to the level of imagination and fantasies, and the actual possibility of experiencing sexual activity as usual. Nevertheless, the participants emphasized an opening to new possibilities in terms of expressing sexuality, accompanied by a rediscovery of the value of tenderness and affectivity as well as a clearer awareness of their sexual life, needs, and desires."

The gold standard culture-based antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is not feasible in the battlefield environment. Thus, a rapid deployable system for bacteria identification and AST directly from wound sample is urgently needed. We report the potential of a Rapid, Label-free Pathogen Identification (RAPID) diagnostic system based on ATR-FTIR method to detect and distinguish multi-drug resistant strains for six different species in the ESKAPEE group. Our RAPID system combines sample processing on-broad to isolate and enrich bacteria cells from wound sample, ATR-FTIR measurement to detect antimicrobial-induced bacterial cell spectral changes, and machine learning model for automated, objective, and quantitative spectral analysis and unknown sample classification. Based on experimental results, our RAPID system is a promising technology for label-free, sensitive (104 cfu/mL from mixture), species-specific (> 95% accuracy), rapid (< 10 min for identification, ~ 4 hours for AST) bacteria detection directly from wound samples."
https://openalex.org/W4229030944,"Evidence on the risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, mortality, hospital stay and cost of treatment in the African context is limited. This study aims to quantify the impact of known risk factors on these outcomes in a large South African private health insured population.This is a cross sectional analytic study based on the analysis of the records of members belonging to health insurances administered by Discovery Health (PTY) Ltd. Demographic data for 188,292 members who tested COVID-19 positive over the period 1 March 2020-28 February 2021 and the hospitalization data for these members up until 30 June 2021 were extracted. Logistic regression models were used for hospitalization and death outcomes, while length of hospital stay and (log) cost per patient were modelled by negative binominal and linear regression models. We accounted for potential differences in the population served and the quality of care within different geographic health regions by including the health district as a random effect. Overall hospitalization and mortality risk was 18.8% and 3.3% respectively. Those aged 65+ years, those with 3 or more comorbidities and males had the highest hospitalization and mortality risks and the longest and costliest hospital stays. Hospitalization and mortality risks were higher in wave 2 than in wave 1. Hospital and mortality risk varied across provinces, even after controlling for important predictors. Hospitalization and mortality risks were the highest for diabetes alone or in combination with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and ischemic heart disease.These findings can assist in developing better risk mitigation and management strategies. It can also allow for better resource allocation and prioritization planning as health systems struggle to meet the increased care demands resulting from the pandemic while having to deal with these in an ever-more resource constrained environment."

Methods We assessed 1000 children (524 girls; 476 boys), 3- to 10.9-year-old (M = 6.9, SD = 2.1; Girls M = 6.9, SD = 2.0; Boys M = 6.9, SD = 2.1), using the Test of Gross Motor Development-3. Using systematic search, original studies investigating FMS in children using the TGMD-3 were eligible; 5 studies were eligible to have the results compared to the Brazilian sample. One sample t-test to run the secondary data from Irish, American, Finnish, and German children (i.e., mean, standard deviation). Results The prevalence of delays and borderline impaired performance was high among Brazilian girls (28.3% and 27.5%) and boys (10.6% and 22.7%). The cross-countries comparisons showed significant (p values from .048 and &lt; .001) overall lower locomotor and ball skills scores for Brazilian children; the only exceptions were skipping, catching, and kicking. We observed stability in performance, across countries, after 8-years-old, and no ceiling effects were found in the samples. Conclusions The Brazilian sample emphasized the need for national strategies to foster children’s motor proficiency. Differences in motor opportunities may explain the differences in motor trajectories between children in WEIRD and LMIC countries."
https://openalex.org/W3216512839,"The choice of crossover and mutation strategies plays a crucial role in the searchability, convergence efficiency and precision of genetic algorithms. In this paper, a novel improved genetic algorithm is proposed by improving the crossover and mutation operation of the simple genetic algorithm, and it is verified by 15 test functions. The qualitative results show that, compared with three other mainstream swarm intelligence optimization algorithms, the algorithm can not only improve the global search ability, convergence efficiency and precision, but also increase the success rate of convergence to the optimal value under the same experimental conditions. The quantitative results show that the algorithm performs superiorly in 13 of the 15 tested functions. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for statistical evaluation, showing the significant advantage of the algorithm at $95\%$ confidence intervals. Finally, the algorithm is applied to neural network adversarial attacks. The applied results show that the method does not need the structure and parameter information inside the neural network model, and it can obtain the adversarial samples with high confidence in a brief time just by the classification and confidence information output from the neural network."
https://openalex.org/W4229002316,"Microalgae have garnered widespread attention as a sustainable source of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. As for extracting lipids from microalgae, the combination of microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and ionic liquids (IL) is shown to be promising. However, such an undertaking usually requires a large consumption of expensive ILs. This study innovatively employs tetramethyl ammonium chloride ([TMAm][Cl]) as an additive in water medium to associate with microwave-assisted ionic liquid extraction (MAILE) in extracting lipids from Nannochloropsis oceanica (N. oceanica) microalgae. In extraction, knowledge of reaction kinetics is crucial since it provides the foundation for developing, controlling, and improving the processes of extraction. Herein, using MAILE, lipids are extracted from N. oceanica microalgae and transesterified to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Mass transfer kinetics are, therefore, investigated using the first and second-order rate law and Patricelli's model. In the development of models, the influence of temperature (60-90°C) and reaction time (1-25 min) on EPA extraction is empirically evaluated. From the thermodynamic study, the positive values of ΔS (+0.10 kJ mol-1K-1) and ΔH (+32.50 kJ mol-1) and the negative value of ΔG (-1.68 to -4.75 kJ mol-1) confirm that this process is endothermic in nature, irreversible and spontaneous. MAILE proves to be a promising approach for the extraction of high-quality EPAs. Due to its low cost, rapid operation, and environmental friendliness, it is seen to be suitable for both pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W4229005249,"Body-Worn Sensors (BWS) provide reliable objective and continuous assessment of Parkinson’s disease (PD) motor symptoms, but their implementation in clinical routine has not yet become widespread. Users’ perceptions of BWS have not been explored. This study intended to evaluate the usability, user experience (UX), patients’ perceptions of BWS, and health professionals’ (HP) opinions on BWS monitoring. A qualitative analysis was performed from semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 patients and 9 HP experts in PD. Patients completed two interviews before and after the BWS one-week experiment, and they answered two questionnaires assessing the usability and UX. Patients rated the three BWS usability with high scores (SUS median [range]: 87.5 [72.5–100]). The UX across all dimensions of their interaction with the BWS was positive. During interviews, all patients and HP expressed interest in BWS monitoring. Patients’ hopes and expectations increased the more they learned about BWS. They manifested enthusiasm to wear BWS, which they imagined could improve their PD symptoms. HP highlighted needs for logistical support in the implementation of BWS in their practice. Both patients and HP suggested possible uses of BWS monitoring in clinical practice, for treatment adjustments for example, or for research purposes. Patients and HP shared ideas about the use of BWS monitoring, although patients may be more likely to integrate BWS into their disease follow-up compared to HP in their practice. This study highlights gaps that need to be fulfilled to facilitate BWS adoption and promote their potential."
https://openalex.org/W4229016405,"Objective Dental mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are potential for use in tissue regeneration in inflammatory diseases due to their rapid proliferating, multilineage differentiation, and strong anti-inflammatory features. In the present study, immunoregulatory and glandular tissue regeneration effects of the dental follicle (DF)MSCs in Sjögren’s Syndrome (SS) were investigated. Methods Dental follicle (DF) tissues were obtained from healthy individuals during tooth extraction, tissues were digested enzymatically and DFMSCs were cultured until the third passage. DFMSCs were labeled with Quantum dot 655 for cell tracking analysis. The induction of the SS mouse model was performed by the injection of Ro60-273-289 peptide intraperitoneally. DFMSCs were injected intraperitoneally, or into submandibular, or lacrimal glands. Splenocytes were analyzed for intracellular cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-10) secretion in T helper cells, lymphocyte proliferation, and B lymphocyte subsets. Histologic analysis was done for submandibular and lacrimal glands with hematoxylin-eosin staining for morphologic examination. Results The systemic injection of DFMSCs significantly reduced intracellular IFN-γ and IL-17 secreting CD4+ T cells in splenocytes (p&lt;0.05), and decreased inflammatory cell deposits and fibrosis in the glandular tissues. DFMSCs differentiated to glandular epithelial cells in submandibular and lacrimal injections with a significant reduction in lymphocytic foci. The results showed that few amounts of DFMSCs were deposited in glandular tissues when applied intraperitoneally, while high amounts of DFMSCs were located in glandular tissues and differentiated to glandular epithelial cells when applied locally in SS murine model. Conclusion DFMSCs have the potential for the regulation of Th1, Th17, and Treg balance in SS, and ameliorate glandular dysfunction. DFMSCs can be a beneficial therapeutic application for SS."
https://openalex.org/W4229024655,"Clinical trials conventionally test aggregate mean differences and assume homogeneous variances across treatment groups. However, significant response heterogeneity may exist. The purpose of this study was to model treatment response variability using gait speed change among older adults participating in caloric restriction (CR) trials. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with five- or six-month assessments were pooled, including 749 participants randomized to CR and 594 participants randomized to non-CR (NoCR). Statistical models compared means and variances by CR assignment and exercise assignment or select subgroups, testing for treatment differences and interactions for mean changes and standard deviations. Continuous equivalents of dichotomized variables were also fit. Models used a Bayesian framework, and posterior estimates were presented as means and 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCI). At baseline, participants were 67.7 (SD = 5.4) years, 69.8% female, and 79.2% white, with a BMI of 33.9 (4.4) kg/m 2 . CR participants reduced body mass [CR: -7.7 (5.8) kg vs. NoCR: -0.9 (3.5) kg] and increased gait speed [CR: +0.10 (0.16) m/s vs. NoCR: +0.07 (0.15) m/s] more than NoCR participants. There were no treatment differences in gait speed change standard deviations [CR–NoCR: -0.002 m/s (95% BCI: -0.013, 0.009)]. Significant mean interactions between CR and exercise assignment [0.037 m/s (95% BCI: 0.004, 0.070)], BMI [0.034 m/s (95% BCI: 0.003, 0.066)], and IL-6 [0.041 m/s (95% BCI: 0.009, 0.073)] were observed, while variance interactions were observed between CR and exercise assignment [-0.458 m/s (95% BCI: -0.783, -0.138)], age [-0.557 m/s (95% BCI: -0.900, -0.221)], and gait speed [-0.530 m/s (95% BCI: -1.018, -0.062)] subgroups. Caloric restriction plus exercise yielded the greatest gait speed benefit among older adults with obesity. High BMI and IL-6 subgroups also improved gait speed in response to CR. Results provide a novel statistical framework for identifying treatment heterogeneity in RCTs."
https://openalex.org/W4229038079,"Introduction We hypothesize that illicit opioid use increases bacterial translocation from the gut, which intensifies systemic inflammation. Objective To investigate the association between opioid use and plasma soluble CD14 [sCD14], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and D-dimer in people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods We analyzed data from the Russia ARCH study–an observational cohort of 351 ART-naive PLWH in St. Petersburg, Russia. Plasma levels of sCD14 (primary outcome), IL-6 and D-dimer (secondary outcomes) were evaluated at baseline, 12, and 24 months. Participants were categorized into three groups based on illicit opioid use: current, prior, and never opioid use. Linear mixed effects models were used to evaluate associations. Results Compared to never opioid use, sCD14 levels were significantly higher for participants with current opioid use (AMD = 197.8 ng/ml [11.4, 384.2], p = 0.04). IL-6 levels were also higher for participants with current vs. never opioid use (ARM = 2.10 [1.56, 2.83], p &lt;0.001). D-dimer levels were higher for current (ARM = 1.95 [1.43, 2.64], p &lt;0.001) and prior (ARM = 1.57 [1.17, 2.09], p = 0.004) compared to never opioid use. Conclusions Among PLWH, current opioid use compared to never use is associated with increased monocyte activation and systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4229045226,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the costliest complex disease affecting the cattle industry worldwide, with significant economic losses. BRD pathogenesis involves several interactions between microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, and management factors. The present study aimed to characterize the nasal virome from 43 pooled nasal swab samples collected from Egyptian nonvaccinated cow-calf operations with acute BRD from January to February 2020 using metagenomic sequencing. Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), first detection of bovine herpesvirus-5 (BHV-5), and first detection of bovine parvovirus-3 (BPV-3) were the most commonly identified in Egyptian cattle. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of glycoprotein B revealed that the BHV-1 isolate is closely related to the Cooper reference strain (genotype 1.1), whereas the BHV-5 isolate is closely related to the reference virus GenBank NP_954920.1. In addition, the whole-genome sequence of BPV-3 showed 93.02% nucleotide identity with the reference virus GenBank AF406967.1. In this study, several DNA viruses, such as BHV-1 and first detection BHV-5, and BPV-3, were detected and may have an association with the BRD in Egyptian cattle. Therefore, further research, including investigating more samples from different locations to determine the prevalence of detected viruses and their contributions to BRD in cattle in Egypt, is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4229059685,"Bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana , is an iconic kelp forest species of the Northeast Pacific that provides a wide range of ecosystem services to coastal marine species and society. In northern California, U.S.A., Nereocystis abundance declined sharply in 2014 and has yet to recover. While abiotic and biotic stressors were present prior to 2014, the population collapse highlights the need for a better understanding of how environmental conditions impact Nereocystis . In this study, we used a newly-developed, satellite-based dataset of bull kelp abundance, proxied by canopy cover over 20 years, to test the hypothesis that winter oceanographic conditions determine summer Nereocystis canopy cover. For the years before the collapse (1991 through 2013), wintertime ocean conditions, synthesized in a Multivariate Ocean Climate Indicator (MOCI), were indeed a good predictor of summer Nereocystis canopy cover (R 2 = 0.40 to 0.87). We attribute this relationship to the effects of upwelling and/or temperature on nutrient availability. South of Point Arena, California, winter ocean conditions had slightly lower explanatory power than north of Point Arena, also reflective of spring upwelling-driven nutrient entrainment. Results suggest that the Nereocystis gametophytes and/or early sporophytes are sensitive to winter oceanographic conditions. Furthermore, environmental conditions in winter 2014 could have been used to predict the Nereocystis collapse in summer 2014, and for kelp north of Point Arena, a further decline in 2015. Importantly, environmental models do not predict changes in kelp after 2015, suggesting biotic factors suppressed kelp recovery, most likely extreme sea urchin herbivory. Conditions during winter, a season that is often overlooked in studies of biophysical interactions, are useful for predicting summer Nereocystis kelp forest canopy cover, and will be useful in supporting kelp restoration actions in California and perhaps elsewhere in the world."
https://openalex.org/W4229077125,"Pseudomonas strain NCIMB10586, in the P. fluorescens subgroup, produces the polyketide antibiotic mupirocin, and has potential as a host for industrial production of a range of valuable products. To underpin further studies on its genetics and physiology, we have used a combination of standard and atypical approaches to achieve a quality of the genome sequence and annotation, above current standards for automated pathways. Assembly of Illumina reads to a PacBio genome sequence created a retrospectively hybrid assembly, identifying and fixing 415 sequencing errors which would otherwise affect almost 5% of annotated coding regions. Our annotation pipeline combined automation based on related well-annotated genomes and stringent, partially manual, tests for functional features. The strain was close to P. synxantha and P. libaniensis and was found to be highly similar to a strain being developed as a weed-pest control agent in Canada. Since mupirocin is a secondary metabolite whose production is switched on late in exponential phase, we carried out RNAseq analysis over an 18 h growth period and have developed a method to normalise RNAseq samples as a group, rather than pair-wise. To review such data we have developed an easily interpreted way to present the expression profiles across a region, or the whole genome at a glance. At the 2-hour granularity of our time-course, the mupirocin cluster increases in expression as an essentially uniform bloc, although the mupirocin resistance gene stands out as being expressed at all the time points."
https://openalex.org/W4229081566,"The increasing concern about the degradation of water-dependent ecosystems calls for considering ecosystems benefits in water management decision-making. Sustainable water management requires adequate economic and biophysical information on water systems supporting both human activities and natural ecosystems. This information is essential for assessing the impact on social welfare of water allocation options. This paper evaluates various alternative water management policies by including the spatial and sectoral interrelationships between the economic and environmental uses of water. A hydroeconomic model is developed to analyze water management policies for adaptation to reduced water availability in the Ebro Basin of Spain. The originality in our contribution is the integration of environmental benefits across the basin, by using endemic biophysical information that relates stream flows and ecosystem status in the Ebro Basin. The results show the enhancement of social welfare that can be achieved by protecting environmental flows, and the tradeoffs between economic and environmental benefits under alternative adaptation strategies. The introduction of water markets is a policy that maximizes the private benefits of economic activities, but disregards environmental benefits. The results show that the current institutional policy where stakeholders cooperate inside the water authority, provides lower private benefits but higher environmental benefits compared to those obtained under water markets, especially under severe droughts. However, the water authority is not allocating enough environmental flows to optimize social welfare. This study informs strategies for protection of environmental flows in the Ebro Basin, which is a compelling decision under the imminent climate change impacts on water availability in coming decades."
https://openalex.org/W4229014504,"It is known from previous literature that type II Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) patients generally, after the age of 5 years, presents a steep deterioration until puberty followed by a relative stability, as most abilities have been lost. Although it is possible to identify points of slope indicating early improvement, steep decline and relative stabilizations, there is still a lot of variability within each age group and it's not always possible to predict individual trajectories of progression from age only. The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model based on machine learning using an XGBoost algorithm for regression and report, explore and quantify, in a single centre longitudinal natural history study, the influence of clinical variables on the 6/12-months Hammersmith Motor Functional Scale Expanded score prediction (HFMSE). This study represents the first approach to artificial intelligence and trained models for the prediction of individualized trajectories of HFMSE disease progression using individual characteristics of the patient. The application of this method to larger cohorts may allow to identify different classes of progression, a crucial information at the time of the new commercially available therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4229029466,"It is a widespread belief that success is mainly due to innate qualities rather than external forces. This is particularly true in sports competitions, where individual talent is usually considered the main, if not the only, ingredient to reach success. In this study, we explore the limits of this belief by quantifying the relative weight of talent and chance in fencing, a combat sport involving a weapon, with the help of both real data and agent-based simulations. Fencing competitions are structured as direct elimination tournaments, where randomness is explicitly present in some rules. We focused on épée, which is one of three disciplines. We collected data on international competition results and annual rankings, in the range 2008–2020, for male and female fencers under 20 years old (Junior category). Then, we built the model calibrated on our dataset and parametrized by just one free variable a , describing the importance of talent—and, consequently, of chance—in competitions ( a = 1 indicates the ideal scenario where only talent matters, a = 0 the complete random one). Our agent-based approach can reproduce the main stylized facts observed in data, at the level of both single tournaments and the entire careers of a given community of épée fencers. We find that simulations approximate very well the data for both Junior Men and Women when talent weights slightly less than chance, i.e. when a is around 0.45. We conclude that the role of chance in fencing is unusually high and it probably represents an extreme case for individual sports. Our findings shed light on the importance of external factors in both athletes’ results in tournaments and throughout their career, making even more unfair the “winner-takes-all” disparities that often occur between the winner and the other classified competitors."
https://openalex.org/W4229030832,"With the development of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), attacks to the vehicle-mounted control area network (CAN) have seriously jeopardized the security of automobiles. As an important security measure, intrusion detection technologies have aroused great interest in researchers and many detection methods have also been proposed based on the vehicle’s CAN bus. However, many studies only considered one type of attack at a time but in real environments there may contain a variety of attack types simultaneously. In view of the deficiency in the current methods, this paper proposed a method to detect multi-intrusions at one time based on a Mosaic coded convolutional neural network (CNN) and a centralized coding method. A Mosaic-like data block was created to convert the one-dimensional CAN ID into a two-dimensional data grid for the CNN to effectively extract the data characteristics and maintain the time characteristics between the CAN IDs. Four types of attacks and all combinations of them were used to train and test our model. Finally, a centralized coding method was used to increase the discrimination capability of the model. Experimental results showed that this single model could successfully detect any combinations of the intrusion types with very high and stable performance."

Patients developing recurrent detachments, media opacities, or with an axial length over 27 mm were excluded from the analysis. LogMAR visual (VA) and LogRAD reading acuity (RA) ± standard deviation (SD), and OCT measurements 6 months after surgery were compared to OCT and VA measurements one month after surgery using multiple linear regression analysis for predictions.VA increased from 0.34 ± 0.25 at one month to 0.22 ± 0.21 after 6 months [p < 0.001; effect size = -0.662, 95% confidence interval (CI): -(0.99-0.33)]. The continuity of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and ellipsoid zone (EZ) increased between 1 and 6 months. Subfoveal ELM integrity after one month predicted VA [adjusted R2 of 8.0%, F(2, 71) = 4.17, p = 0.018] and RA [adjusted R2 of 29%, F(2, 27) = 6.81, p = 0.002] after 6 months. EZ integrity had a less pronounced predictive effect on VA and RA. ELM integrity after 1 month correlated with better reading acuity after 6 months (p = 0.016).VA and morphological OCT parameters improve between 1 and 6 months after surgery for miRD. The grade of ELM is a better predictor for RA than for VA, explaining more variance."
https://openalex.org/W4229062087,"This paper studies the impact of strategic customer behavior on retailers’ omni-channel strategies. Customers in the market are classified into strategic omni-channel customers and myopic B&amp;M (brick and mortar) store customers. The retailer firstly charges a full price but will then salvage the leftover inventory at a lower price (markdown policy) for strategic omni-channel customers after the customers’ demand is realized. The strategic omni-channel customers choose purchase timing to maximize their own expected profit. While, the myopic B&amp;M store customers do not choose purchase timing. By characterizing rational expectation equilibrium, we find that the inventory level under markdown policy is higher than that in the classic model where no markdown policy is implemented. Also, the policy will transfer more strategic customers to the online channel to buy at full price so that the retailer will benefit from it. Besides, inventory commitment policy can further increase retailer’s profit based on markdown policy. In addition, we extend the model to the supply chain and present the contrasting view that the total profit of the decentralized supply chain under the wholesale price contract is higher than that of the centralized supply chain. The influence of strategic customer behavior and system parameters on the retailer’s optimal decision is discussed through numerical study."
https://openalex.org/W4229065681,"Synchronization in complex networks has been investigated for decades. Due to the particularity of the interlinks between networks, the synchronization in interdependent networks has received increasing interest. Since the interlinks are not always symmetric in interdependent networks, we focus on the synchronization in unidirectional interdependent networks to study the control scheme. The mathematical model is put forward and some factors are taken into consideration, such as different coupling functions and strengths. Firstly, the feasibility of the control scheme is proved theoretically by using Lyapunov stability theory and verified by simulations. Then, we find that the synchronization could be maintained in one sub-network by utilizing our control scheme while the nodes in the other sub-network are in chaos. The result indicates that the influence of interlinks can be decreased and the proposed scheme can guarantee the synchronization in one sub-network at least. Moreover, we also discuss the robust of our control scheme against the cascading failure. The scheme is verified by simulations to be effective while the disturbances occur."
https://openalex.org/W4229068636,"Inhaled antibiotics control chronic airway infection and maintain respiratory health in cystic fibrosis (CF). Given variation in patient responses to inhaled antibiotics, the ability to identify distinct responder phenotypes would facilitate the delivery of personalized care. Previously, a 10-gene panel was identified, measured directly from blood leukocytes, which predicted host response to intravenous antibiotic treatment during pulmonary exacerbations. In the current study, we tested whether the same panel predicted clinical response in subjects receiving a month of inhaled antibiotic therapy with aztreonam lysine (AZLI; Cayston®). A small cohort of CF subjects infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were enrolled at baseline health, prior to initiating one month’s treatment with AZLI using the Altera® nebulizer system. Eighteen CF subjects underwent blood leukocyte gene panel measurements, sputum quantitative microbiology, spirometry, and C-reactive protein (CRP) measurement prior to onset and at completion of 4 weeks of AZLI therapy. Mean absolute improvement in percent predicted Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (ppFEV 1 ) was 3%. Significant reductions in sputum bacterial colony counts were detected with treatment. CRP increased following treatment. While single genes within the panel did not change significantly following treatment, the analysis of multigene panel data demonstrated that HCA112 gene predicted ppFEV 1 improvement. Hierarchical clustering based on gene expression yielded two distinctive molecular clusters before and after AZLI therapy. In conclusion, peripheral blood leukocyte genes quantifying inflammation are associated with responses to inhaled antibiotic therapy. Molecular quantification of systemic inflammation may indicate subgroups of CF subjects with variations in underlying inflammation and with variable clinical responses to inhaled antibiotics. Given the size limitation of the study, larger studies are needed in order to evaluate whether molecular measures may add precision to the determination of infectious and inflammatory outcomes following courses of inhaled antimicrobial therapies.

https://openalex.org/W4229001763,"The aim of this study was to investigate differences in psychological characteristics between people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) from Japan and Australia. Sixty-two adults from Japan and 168 adults from Australia aged over 50 years with knee pain were included. Japanese data were collected from patients with knee OA diagnosed by medical doctors. Australian data were baseline data from a randomized controlled trial. Participants were not exercising regularly or receiving physiotherapy at the time. Psychological characteristics evaluated were depressive symptoms, fear of movement, and pain catastrophizing. These psychological characteristics were compared between the Japanese and Australian cohorts by calculating 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for difference of the mean. To test for equivalence, an equivalence margin was set at 0.5 standard deviations (SD) of the mean, where these SDs were based on the Australian data. When the 95%CI for the difference of the mean value lay entirely within the range of equivalence margin (i.e. between -0.5 and 0.5 times the Australian SD), the outcome was considered equivalent. There were no differences between the groups from Japan and Australia for depressive symptoms and the two groups were considered equivalent. There was no difference between groups for fear of movement, however the criteria for equivalence was not met. People from Japan with knee OA had higher scores for pain catastrophizing than people from Australia. The findings should be confirmed in other samples of people with knee OA from Japan and Australia due to the limitations of the participant recruitment strategy in this study. However, our findings suggest there may be a greater need to consider pain catastrophizing and build pain self-efficacy when managing Japanese people with knee OA. Implementation of international clinical practice guidelines for OA management may require different strategies in different countries due to different psychological profiles."
https://openalex.org/W4229003435,"Quantity estimation can be represented in either an analog or symbolic manner and recent evidence now suggests that analog and symbolic representation of quantities interact. Nonetheless, those two representational forms of quantities may be enhanced by convergent multisensory information. Here, we elucidate those interactions using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) and an audiovisual oddball paradigm. Participants were presented simultaneous audiovisual tokens in which the co-varying pitch of tones was combined with the embedded cardinality of dot patterns. Incongruencies were elicited independently from symbolic and non-symbolic modality within the audio-visual percept, violating the newly acquired rule that ""the higher the pitch of the tone, the larger the cardinality of the figure."" The effect of neural plasticity in symbolic and non-symbolic numerical representations of quantities was investigated through a cross-sectional design, comparing musicians to musically naïve controls. Individual's cortical activity was reconstructed and statistically modeled for a predefined time-window of the evoked response (130-170 ms). To summarize, we show that symbolic and non-symbolic processing of magnitudes is re-organized in cortical space, with professional musicians showing altered activity in motor and temporal areas. Thus, we argue that the symbolic representation of quantities is altered through musical training."

However, few results have been reported for the effects of KRG on the trabecular microarchitecture as compared to changes resulting from physiological stimuli such as exercise load. We compared the effects of KRG and jump exercise on improvements in trabecular microarchitecture and strength of the distal femoral metaphysis in rats.Eleven-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into sedentary (CON), KRG-administered (KRG), and jump-exercised (JUM) groups. Rats were orally administered KRG extract (200 mg/kg body weight/day) once a day for 6 weeks. The jump exercise protocol comprised 10 jumps/day, 5 days/week at a jump height of 40 cm. We used microcomputed tomography to assess the microarchitecture, volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), and fracture load as predicted by finite element analysis at the right distal femoral metaphysis. The left femur was used for the quantitative bone histomorphometry measurements.Although KRG produced significantly higher trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) than CON, BV/TV was even higher in JUM than in KRG, and differences in vBMD and fracture load were only significant between JUM and CON. In terms of trabecular microarchitecture, KRG increased trabecular number and connectivity, whereas the JUM group showed increased trabecular thickness. Bone resorption showed significant decrease by JUM and KRG group. In contrast, bone formation showed significant increase by JUM group.These data show that KRG has weak but significant positive effects on bone mass and suggest that the effects on trabecular microarchitecture differ from those of jump exercise. The effects of combined KRG and jump exercise on trabecular bone mass and strength should be investigated."

Concern surrounding suture anchor placement inspired the use navigation systems in shoulder arthroscopy. We aimed to demonstrate the technological advantage of using the O-arm (Medtronic Navigation, Denver, CO, USA) image guidance system to provide real-time images during portal and anchor placements in shoulder arthroscopy. Consecutive patients (from July to October 2014) who were admitted for arthroscopic capsulolabral repair surgeries were included. Ten patients were randomly enrolled in the navigation group and 10 in the traditional group. The glenoid was divided into four zones, and the penetration rates in each zone were compared between the two groups. In zone III, the most inferior region of the glenoid, the penetration rate was 40.9% in the traditional group and 15.7% in the navigation group (P = 0.077), demonstrating a trend toward improved accuracy of anchor placement with the aid of the navigation system; however, this was not statistically significant. Average surgical time in the navigation and traditional groups was 177.6±40.2 and 117.7±17.6 mins, respectively. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder Scores showed no difference before and 6 months after surgery. This pilot study showed a trend toward decreased penetration rate in O-arm-navigated capsulolabral repair surgeries and decreased risks of implant misplacement; however, possibly due to the small sample size, the difference was not statistically significant. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm the possible benefit of the navigation system. Even with the use of navigation systems, there were still some penetrations in zone III of the glenoid. This penetration may be attributed to the micro-motion of the acromioclavicular joint. Although the navigation group showed a significant increase in surgical time, with improvements in instrument design, O-arm-navigated arthroscopy will gain popularity in clinical practice."

https://openalex.org/W4229050075,"Q Fever is a zoonotic disease of significant animal and public health concern, caused by Coxiella burnetii (C . burnetii) , an obligate intracellular bacterium. This study was done to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity (D Se ) and diagnostic specificity (D Sp ) of three diagnostic methods to diagnose C . burnetii infection in cattle and buffaloes in Punjab, India: an indirect ELISA method applied in serum samples and a trans-Polymerase Chain Reaction (trans-PCR) technique applied in milk samples and genital swabs, using a Bayesian latent class analysis. Conditional independence was assumed between the tests, given (i) the different biological principle of ELISA and trans-PCR and (ii) the fact that the trans-PCR was performed on different tissues. The ELISA method in the serum samples showed the highest D Se of 0.97 (95% Probability Intervals (PIs): 0.93; 0.99) compared to the trans-PCR method applied in milk samples 0.76 (0.63; 0.87) and genital swabs 0.73 (0.58; 0.85). The D Sps of all tests were high, with trans-PCR in genital swabs recording the highest D Sp of 0.99 (0.98; 1), while the D Sp of trans-PCR in milk samples and ELISA in serum samples were 0.97 (0.95; 0.99) and 0.95 (0.93; 0.97) respectively. The study results show that none of the applied tests are perfect, therefore, a testing regimen based on the diagnostic characteristic of the tests may be considered for diagnosis of C . burnetii ."
https://openalex.org/W4229050668,"Clinical simulation as a teaching methodology allows the student to train and learn technical abilities and/or non-technical abilities. One of the key elements of this teaching methodology is the debriefing, which consists of a conversation between several people, in which the participants go over a real or simulated event in order to analyze their actions and reflect on the role that thought processes, psychomotor skills and emotional states can play in maintaining, or improving their performance in the future. The Debriefing Experience Scale allows the experience of students in debriefing to be measured. The objective of this study is to translate the Debriefing Experience Scale (DES) into Spanish and analyze its reliability and validity to measure the experience of nursing students during the debriefing. The study was developed in two phases: One: the adaption of the instrument to Spanish, two: a transversal study carried out in a sample of 290 nursing students. The psychometric properties were analyzed in terms of reliability and construct validity using confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA). Cronbach’s alpha was adequate for all the scales and for each one of the dimensions. The confirmatory factorial analysis showed that the 4-dimensional model is acceptable for both scales (experience and opinion). The Spanish version Debriefing Experience Scale questionnaire is useful, valid and reliable for use to measure the debriefing experience of university students in a simulation activity."
https://openalex.org/W4229053746,"Several studies have demonstrated the association of lncRNAs with a variety of cancers. Here, we explored the role of LINC00922 in gastric cancer (GC) using bioinformatics approaches and in vitro experiments. We examined the expression of LINC00922 and the prognosis of GC patients based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). LINC00922-related genes were identified by the Multi Experiment Matrix (MEM) database and The Atlas of Noncoding RNAs in Cancer (TANRIC), followed by Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and protein-protein interaction analysis. The significance of LINC00922 in cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and migration was assessed by MTT assay, flow cytometry, Transwell assay and wound-healing assay. The expression of LINC00922 was increased in GC tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and increased LINC00922 expression was correlated with poor overall survival and disease-free survival. In addition, 336 overlapping genes were identified by the MEM database and TANRIC and found to be involved in GC-related biological processes, such as cell adhesion and migration, as well as TGF-β signaling. In the protein-protein interaction network, hub genes, such as FSTL3 and LAMC1, were identified. LINC00922 overexpression significantly promoted cell proliferation and invasion in vitro, whereas LINC00922 knockdown exerted opposite effects. In summary, our findings indicate that LINC00922 is overexpressed in GC tissues, suggesting that it might play a role in the development and progression of GC, and thus, it might serve as a prognostic indicator of GC."
https://openalex.org/W4229071720,"Background Determining the nutritional status of lactating women is important because underweight lactating mothers will have low energy levels and reduced cognitive abilities, which will affect the inadequate care of their young children. Thus, malnutrition is passed down from generation to generation, perpetuating the vicious cycle. There is scarce national data on determinants of underweight among lactating mothers in Ethiopia. Hence, this study aimed to identify individual and community-level determinants of underweight among lactating mothers in Ethiopia. Methods Data from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) from 2016 were used. A total of 3848 lactating mothers were included in this study, and a multilevel, multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify determinants of underweight among lactating mothers. Results The odds of being underweight among rural lactating mothers were 65% higher (AOR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.13, 2.41) than lactating mothers in the urban area. The odds of being underweight among lactating mothers who have toilet facilities were 33% lower (AOR = 0.67, 95%CI = 0.54, 0.83) compared with those do not have toilet facilities. Those mothers in the age group of 25–34 years and greater than 35 years had (AOR = 0.61,95%CI = 0.48, 0.79), and (AOR = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.47, 0.95) times lower chance of being underweight compared with those who had 15–24 years of age, respectively. The likelihood of being underweight among lactating mothers in high community poverty (AOR = 1.40, 95%CI = 1.08, 1.82) was higher than the lower community poverty level. Conclusion Underweight among lactating mothers was significantly associated with individual-level (age and toilet facilities) variables and community-level (residence and community poverty). Therefore, focusing on these identified factors could improve underweight among lactating mothers in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W4229074108,"The aim of the present study was to evaluated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI), and triglyceride and glucose (TG) index as predictive indicators for low feed intake in lactating sows due to glucose intolerance. Cactus ( Opuntia ficus-indica ) was included in sow diets as a modulating factor of glucose. Thirty-six sows were separated into three groups (Gs). Although the three groups received a conventional diet during gestation and lactation, 2.0 kg per sow per day of steam-cooked cactus (G1) and fresh cactus (G2) were added to the lactation diet as a glycemic modulating factor, with G3 serving as the control group. Glycemia was assessed via glucometer (blood glucose concentrations), HbA1c and HGI. For each indicator of glycemia the triglycerides and glucose (TG) index was evaluated. The highest blood glucose concentration was observed on day 3 of lactation (88.2 mg/dL). The average glycemic concentrations obtained from HbA1c on farrowing day (61.6 mg/dL) and day 21 of lactation (65.6 mg/dL) were lower (p&lt;0.05) than those measured by a glucometer on the same days (71.8 and 77.7 mg/dL for farrowing day and day 21 of lactation, respectively). At farrowing, the TG index obtained from the HGI indicated that 83.0% of sows were glucose intolerant, compared to 100% according to the TG index obtained from a glucometer. At weaning, 50% of G2 did not show glucose intolerance when the TG index was calculated using the HGI, compared to 54% when it was calculated with blood glucose concentrations measured by a glucometer. All G3 sows presented glucose intolerance, regardless of the test used. The HbA1c, HGI, and TG index tests are viable alternatives to predict low feed intake due to glucose intolerance in lactating sows."
https://openalex.org/W4229077873,"Importance Cardiovascular Health (CVH) scores are inversely associated with prevalent subclinical (SubDz) and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the majority of people who develop CVD have intermediate or ideal CVH scores, while many with poor CVH profiles escape CVD development. Objective To describe the prevalence of paradoxical relations among CVH, SubDz, and CVD. Design Cohort study, Framingham Study data collected prospectively (1995–2016). Setting Population-based. Participants 7,627 participants (mean age 49 years, 53% women) attending Offspring examinations 6/7 and Third Generation examinations 1/2. Exposures CVH score (range 0–14) constructed from poor, intermediate, or ideal status for each metric (smoking, diet, physical activity, blood pressure, body mass index, fasting glucose, total cholesterol); and prevalent SubDz (≥1 of: increased carotid intimal media thickness, CIMT; left ventricular hypertrophy, LVH; microalbuminuria, MA; elevated ankle brachial index, ABI; coronary artery calcium score ≥100,CAC). Main outcome(s) and measure(s) Ideal CVH (scores 12–14), intermediate CVH (scores 8–11), and poor CVH (0–7). We described three distinct paradoxical phenomena, involving combinations of CVH, SubDz, and CVD, and generated CVD incidence rates and predicted CVD probabilities for all combinations. Results We observed 842 CVD events (median follow-up 13.7 years); 1,663 participants had SubDz. Most individuals with poor CVH (78%) or SubDz (57% for CIMT to 77% for LVH) did not develop CVD on follow-up. Among participants with incident CVD, the majority had intermediate or ideal CVH (68%) or absent SubDz (46% for CAC to 96% for ABI) at baseline. We observed similar paradoxical results in relations between CVH and prevalent SubDz. Poor CVH and prevalent SubDz were each associated with higher CVD incidence rates compared to intermediate or ideal CVH and absent SubDz, respectively. The predicted CVD probability was nearly three-times greater among participants with poor (22%) versus intermediate or ideal CVH (8%). Mean CVD predicted probabilities were nearly three (26% vs. 10% for MA) to six-times (29% vs. 5% for CAC) greater among participants with SubDz versus without SubDz. Findings were consistent within age and sex strata. Conclusions and relevance Although poor CVH and SubDz presence are associated with CVD incidence, paradoxical phenomena involving CVH, SubDz, and CVD are frequently prevalent in the community. Further studies to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying these phenomena are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4229079401,"The early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is a crucial task to protect population health. To this end, public health surveillance systems have been established to systematically collect and analyse infectious disease data. A variety of statistical tools are available, which detect potential outbreaks as abberations from an expected endemic level using these data. Here, we present supervised hidden Markov models for disease outbreak detection, which use reported outbreaks that are routinely collected in the German infectious disease surveillance system and have not been leveraged so far. This allows to directly integrate labeled outbreak data in a statistical time series model for outbreak detection. We evaluate our model using real Salmonella and Campylobacter data, as well as simulations. The proposed supervised learning approach performs substantially better than unsupervised learning and on par with or better than a state-of-the-art approach, which is applied in multiple European countries including Germany."
https://openalex.org/W4229082987,"DNA double-strand breaks are one of the most deleterious lesions for the cells, therefore understanding the macromolecular interactions of the DNA repair-related mechanisms is essential. DNA damage triggers transcription silencing at the damage site, leading to the removal of the elongating RNA polymerase II (S2P RNAPII) from this locus, which provides accessibility for the repair factors to the lesion. We previously demonstrated that following transcription block, p53 plays a pivotal role in transcription elongation by interacting with S2P RNAPII. In the current study, we reveal that p53 is involved in the fine-tune regulation of S2P RNAPII ubiquitylation. Furthermore, we emphasize the potential role of p53 in delaying the premature ubiquitylation and the subsequent chromatin removal of S2P RNAPII as a response to transcription block."
