https://openalex.org/W2145957605,"The first images of Jupiter, Io, Europa, and Ganymede from the Galileo spacecraft reveal new information about Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) and the surfaces of the Galilean satellites. Features similar to clusters of thunderstorms were found in the GRS. Nearby wave structures suggest that the GRS may be a shallow atmospheric feature. Changes in surface color and plume distribution indicate differences in resurfacing processes near hot spots on Io. Patchy emissions were seen while Io was in eclipse by Jupiter. The outer margins of prominent linear markings (triple bands) on Europa are diffuse, suggesting that material has been vented from fractures. Numerous small circular craters indicate localized areas of relatively old surface. Pervasive brittle deformation of an ice layer appears to have formed grooves on Ganymede. Dark terrain unexpectedly shows distinctive albedo variations to the limit of resolution."

The width of these narrow lines, formed by concentrations of organic material, corresponds to the quantity of shell material that would be expected to dissolve during periods of anaerobic metabolism. The pH in the extrapallial fluid of the bivalve decreases when the valves are closed, and the amount of dissolution of shell is related to the duration of valve closure."

https://openalex.org/W2096725492,"Twenty years of atmospheric transmission data from Mauna Loa Observatory show secular decreases at irregular intervals. In addition, a regular annual variation is present during unperturbed as well as perturbed periods. These variations in transmission can be measured to a few tenths of a percent from the data record. Transient decreases in transmission are strongly correlated with explosive volcanic eruptions that inject effluent into the stratosphere. Recovery from these ejections takes as much as 8 years and the recovery curve is linear. Observations in 1977 at Mauna Loa show that, for the first time since the Mount Agung eruption in 1963, the atmospheric transmission of direct-incidence solar irradiation at Mauna Loa returned to values measured in 1958 to 1962."
https://openalex.org/W2030323029,"The seeds of the Neotropical legume, Dioclea megacarpa, the sole food source for developing larvae of the bruchid beetle, Caryedes brasiliensis, contain about 13 percent L-canavanine (dry weight). Canavanine detoxification and utilization produces L-canaline, a potent neurotoxic and insecticidal amino acid. This seed predator has developed a unique biochemical mechanism for degrading canaline by reductive deamination to form homoserine and ammonia. In this way, canaline is detoxified; canavanine's stored nitrogen is more fully utilized and its carbon skeleton is conserved."

Data on breathing and movement show that during that time the whale took 58 breaths in 130 minutes and traveled 20 kilometers at more than 9 kilometers per hour. Precise measurements of such parameters and of other features of the life history of great whales, which travel long distances over the high seas, often in groups, are now possible through radio tagging."
https://openalex.org/W2053981133,"A recently discovered predatory ciliate has an unusual developmental pattern in which the swimming cells cease feeding and aggregate on a substrate near the surface of a liquid medium. The aggregate then rises aerially, producing an acellular stalk and a sorus of encysted cells. Sorogenesis requires alternate light and dark periods."
https://openalex.org/W1981434968,"A novel and convenient synthesis of isocyanic acid (HNCO) and its trimer isocyanuric acid has been obtained by the conversion of nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen mixed in helium at the level of 0.3 to 5 percent reacted over iridium and palladium catalysts at 280 degrees to 450 degrees C to form HNCO in 60 to 75 percent yield. Major side products were ammonium cyanate at low temperature and ammonia or nitrogen at high temperature. Total conversion of nitrogen from NO to NCO reached 73 percent over palladium and 86 percent over iridium."

https://openalex.org/W2066146967,"In her letter of 23 August (p. [p. 1031][1]), Lucy Johns repeats the charge that a clause in the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) “drastically dilutes protection against discrimination by gender.” This charge, an effort to defeat the CCRI, is simply untrue. In an open letter to the people of California, 26 of the most distinguished constitutional lawyers in the country, some in favor of and some opposed to the CCRI, were prompted by this charge to go on record as saying so ([1][2]). The letter includes the following statements.

> The CCRI is a general ban on a wide range of sex classifications: “The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.”
> 
> But clause (c) says that “Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as prohibiting bona fide qualifications based on sex which are reasonably necessary to the normal operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting.” …
> 
> The [bona fide qualifications] proviso doesn't set up some weak “reasonableness test.” It allows only those sex classifications that pass both the existing California constitutional tests and fit within the very narrow area of bona fide qualifications. And it avoids the problems that a total ban on sex classifications might cause: The law shouldn't, for instance, require that the state let male guards do strip searches of female jail inmates. Likewise, the law shouldn't require high school girls' basketball teams to allow boys to participate.

The signers end on the following note.

> We welcome honest, thoughtful debate on affirmative action. But we oppose erroneous statements such as those made about clause (c).

https://openalex.org/W1977888987,"I second the opinion of Stan Metzenberg (Letters, 9 Aug., [9 Aug., p. 721][1]), regarding the absurdity of the National Science Foundation spending $5 million to encourage faculty at research universities to teach well. Metzenberg's critique, however, which aims at increased support for the “second-tier universities” where “faculty actually teach their own courses,” leaves out the fact that it is this nation's liberal arts and sciences colleges which have historically produced a disproportionately large number of students who have gone on to earn doctorates in the sciences and which continue to provide leadership in the design and implementation of the most effective undergraduate teaching methods. If $5 million spent to support science teaching at second-tier universities would have a significant impact, imagine how powerful would be the results of those same dollars spent at liberal arts and sciences colleges to support and reaffirm the outstanding job they are already doing. Just one small portion of those dollars provided to increase support for student-faculty collaborative research—typical at our colleges, but rare except at the graduate level in the first- and second-tier universities—would have an impact far beyond its “drop-in-the-bucket” significance for the big research universities.
