https://openalex.org/W2769811483,"Deep learning has started to revolutionize several different industries, and the applications of these methods in medicine are now becoming more commonplace. This study focuses on investigating the feasibility of tracking patients and clinical staff wearing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) tags in a radiation oncology clinic using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The performance of these networks was compared to relative received signal strength indicator (RSSI) thresholding and triangulation. By utilizing temporal information, a combined CNN+ANN network was capable of correctly identifying the location of the BLE tag with an accuracy of 99.9%. It outperformed a CNN model (accuracy = 94%), a thresholding model employing majority voting (accuracy = 95%), and a triangulation classifier utilizing majority voting (accuracy = 95%). Future studies will seek to deploy this affordable real time location system in hospitals to improve clinical workflow, efficiency, and patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W2896198350,"Both epidemiological studies and randomised controlled trials have shown that meat-eating can be harmful to human health. Meat-eating is also considered to be a moral issue, impacting negatively on the environment and the welfare of animals. To date, very little scientific research has aimed to reduce this dietary behavior. Therefore, the current research tests the effectiveness of a 4-week multicomponent intervention designed to reduce meat-eating. Using a randomised controlled trial procedure, thirty-two young men (mean age: 23.5 ± 3.1 years old) were randomly assigned into two equal groups, the intervention vs control group. Based on research in social and health psychology, the intervention was composed of five components expected to reduce meat consumption: a social norm component; an informational/educational component; an appeal to fear; a mind attribution induction; and a goal setting/self-monitoring component. Measures of different types of meat intake (using dietary journals) were taken at baseline (Time 1) as well as 2 (Time 2) and 4 weeks later (Time 3). Emotions and attitudes toward meat-eating and animals were also assessed at Time 3. Significant reductions in total and weekend red meat consumption as well as cold cuts consumed on the weekend were observed in the intervention condition from Time 1 to Time 3. Moreover, reduced positive emotions toward eating meat mediated the reduction in red meat consumption. The component of the intervention that participants most often perceived as having led to a reduction in their meat consumption was the informational component. In conclusion, results provide support for the effectiveness of the multicomponent intervention and for the mediating role of positive emotions when predicting behavioral changes in meat consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2897036289,"This study investigated the effects of palmitoleic acid on different phases of the healing process. Macroscopic analyses were performed on wounds in rats with or without palmitoleic acid treatment, and the results showed that palmitoleic acid directly hastened wound closure. The topical treatment of wounds with palmitoleic acid resulted in smaller wounds than those observed in the control group. The anti-inflammatory activity of palmitoleic acid may be responsible for healing, especially in the stages of granulation tissue formation and remodelling. Palmitoleic acid modified TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, CINC-2α/β, MIP-3α and VEGF-α profiles at the wound site 24, 48, 120, 216 and 288 hours post-wounding. Assays assessing neutrophil migration and exudate formation in sterile inflammatory air pouches revealed that palmitoleic acid had potent anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting the LPS-induced release of TNF-α (73.14%, p≤0.05), IL-1β (66.19%, p≤0.001), IL-6 (75.19%, p≤0.001), MIP-3α (70.38%, p≤0.05), and l-selectin (16%, p≤0.05). Palmitoleic acid also inhibited LPS-stimulated neutrophil migration. We concluded that palmitoleic acid accelerates wound healing via an anti-inflammatory effect."
https://openalex.org/W2896479879,"Breeding for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in durum wheat is complicated by the quantitative trait expression and narrow genetic diversity of available resources. High-density mapping of the FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL), evaluation of their co-localization with plant height and maturity QTL and the interaction among the identified QTL are the objectives of this study. Two doubled haploid (DH) populations, one developed from crosses between Triticum turgidum ssp. durum lines DT707 and DT696 and the other between T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. Strongfield and T. turgidum ssp. carthlicum cv. Blackbird were genotyped using the 90K Infinium iSelect chip and evaluated phenotypically at multiple field FHB nurseries over years. A moderate broad-sense heritability indicated a genotype-by-environment interaction for the expression of FHB resistance in both populations. Resistance QTL were identified for the DT707 × DT696 population on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5A (two loci) and 7A and for the Strongfield × Blackbird population on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3A, 6A, 6B and 7B with the QTL on chromosome 1A and those on chromosome 5A being more consistently expressed over environments. FHB resistance co-located with plant height and maturity QTL on chromosome 5A and with a maturity QTL on chromosome 7A for the DT707 × DT696 population. Resistance also co-located with plant height QTL on chromosomes 2A and 3A and with maturity QTL on chromosomes 1A and 7B for the Strongfield × Blackbird population. Additive × additive interactions were identified, for example between the two FHB resistance QTL on chromosome 5A for the DT707 × DT696 population and the FHB resistance QTL on chromosomes 1A and 7B for the Strongfield × Blackbird population. Application of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphic (SNP) markers associated with FHB resistance QTL identified in this study will accelerate combining genes from the two populations."
https://openalex.org/W2897859032,"Objective This randomised clinical trial aimed to compare the impact of two different tooth replacement strategies for partially dentate older patients namely; removable partial dentures (RPDs) and functionally orientated treatment based on the shortened dental arch (SDA) concept, on Oral Health-related Quality of Life (OHrQOL). Methods 89 patients completed a randomised clinical trial. Patients were recruited in two centres: Cork University Dental Hospital (CUDH) and a Geriatric Day Hospital (SFDH). 44 patients were randomly allocated to the RPD group and 45 to the SDA group where adhesive bridgework was used to provide 10 pairs of occluding contacts. The impact of treatment on OHrQOL was used as the primary outcome measure. Each patient completed the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) at baseline, 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after treatment. Results Both treatment groups reported improvements in OHIP-14 scores at 24 months (p<0.05). For the SDA group OHIP-14 scores improved by 8.0 scale points at 12 months (p<0.001) and 5.9 scale points at 24 months (p<0.05). For the RPD group OHIP-14 scores improved by 5.7 scale points at 12 months (p<0.05) and 4.2 scale points at 24 months (p<0.05). Analysis using ANCOVA showed that there were significant between group differences recorded in both treatment centres. 24 months after intervention the SDA group recorded better OHIP-14 scores by an average of 2.9 points in CUDH (p<0.0001) and by an average of 7.9 points in SFDH (p<0.0001) compared to the RPD group. Conclusions Patients in the SDA group maintained their improvements in OHrQOL scores throughout the 24 month study period. For the RPD group the initial improvement in OHrQOL score began to diminish after 6 months, particularly for those treated in SFDH. Thus, the benefits of functionally orientated treatment increased over time, particularly for the older, more systemically unwell cohort in SFDH."
https://openalex.org/W2897573951,"Here we demonstrate that by applying exclusively Martian resources a processing route involving suspensions of mineral particles called slurries or slips can be established for manufacturing ceramics on Mars. We developed water-based slurries without the use of additives that had a 51 wt. % solid load resembling commercial porcelain slurries in respect to the particle size distribution and rheological properties. These slurries were used to slip cast discs, rings and vases that were sintered at temperatures between 1000 and 1130 °C using different sintering schedules, the latter were set-up according the results of hot-stage microscopic characterization. The microstructure, porosity and the mechanical properties were characterized by SEM, X-ray computer tomography and Weibull analysis. Our wet processing of minerals yields ceramics with complex shapes that show similar mechanical properties to porcelain and could serve as a technology for future Mars colonization. The best quality parts with completely vitrificated matrix supporting a few idiomorphic crystals are obtained at 1130 °C with 10 h dwell time with volume and linear shrinkage as much as ~62% and ~17% and a characteristic compressive strength of 51 MPa."
https://openalex.org/W2586431187,"Researchers in many disciplines have previously used a variety of mathematical techniques for analyzing group interactions. Here we use a new metric for this purpose, called “integrated information” or “phi.” Phi was originally developed by neuroscientists as a measure of consciousness in brains, but it captures, in a single mathematical quantity, two properties that are important in many other kinds of groups as well: differentiated information and integration. Here we apply this metric to the activity of three types of groups that involve people and computers. First, we find that 4-person work groups with higher measured phi perform a wide range of tasks more effectively, as measured by their collective intelligence. Next, we find that groups of Wikipedia editors with higher measured phi create higher quality articles. Last, we find that the measured phi of the collection of people and computers communicating on the Internet increased over a recent six-year period. Together, these results suggest that integrated information can be a useful way of characterizing a certain kind of interactional complexity that, at least sometimes, predicts group performance. In this sense, phi can be viewed as a potential metric of effective group collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2897107712,"BAF250a and BAF250b are subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex that recruit the complex to chromatin allowing transcriptional activation of several genes. Despite being the central subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, the structural and functional annotation of BAF250a/b remains poorly understood. BAF250a (nearly 2200 residues protein) harbors an N-terminal DNA binding ARID (~110 residues) and a C-terminal folded region (~250 residues) of unknown structure and function, recently annotated as BAF250_C. Using hydrophobic core analysis, fold prediction and comparative modeling, here we have defined a domain boundary and associate a β-catenin like ARM-repeat fold to the C-terminus of BAF250a that encompass BAF250_C. The N-terminal DNA-binding ARID is found in diverse domain combinations in proteins imparting unique functions. We used a comparative sequence analysis based approach to study the ARIDs from diverse domain contexts and identified conserved residue positions that are important to preserve its core structure. Supporting this, mutation of one such conserved residue valine, at position 1067, to glycine, resulted in destabilization, loss of structural integrity and DNA binding affinity of ARID. Additionally, we identified a set of conserved and surface-exposed residues unique to the ARID when it co-occurs with the ARM repeat containing BAF250_C in BAF250a. Several of these residues are found mutated in somatic cancers. We predict that these residues in BAF250a may play important roles in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions in the BAF complex."
https://openalex.org/W2897173882,"The BH3-only family member BNIP3 has been described as either promoting cell survival or cell death. This depends upon the level of BNIP3 expression and its cellular localization. Increased BNIP3 expression under hypoxia contributes to cell death through increased mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, mice lacking BNIP3 show inhibition of ischemic cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In contrast, nuclear localization of BNIP3 contributes to blockage of apoptosis in glioma cells through repression of pro-apoptotic genes. We have discovered that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking BNIP3 expression show increased proliferation and cell number compared to wild-type cells. Furthermore, the cells lacking BNIP3 showed increased MAPK activation. Increased proliferation was not due to decreased cell death as oxidative stress induced cell death in BNIP3 null MEFs. In addition, we isolated astrocytes from wild-type or embryonic mice lacking expression of BNIP3. There was increased density and cell number in the astrocytes lacking BNIP3 expression. To confirm these results in human cells, we inducibly expressed BNIP3 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells and found that induced BNIP3 reduced cell proliferation and failed to change background cell death levels. Transient over-expression of BNIP3 in the nucleus of HEK293 cells also reduced DNA synthesis. Finally, to determine whether this increased proliferation occurs in mice lacking BNIP3, we isolated brains from wild-type mice or those lacking BNIP3 expression. The mice lacking BNIP3 had increased cellularity in the brain of embryonic and adult mice. Taken together, our study describes a new function for BNIP3 in the regulation of cellular proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2897425458,"The study examined the psychometric characteristics of three automated working memory span tasks: operational, reading, and symmetry span task, administered in groups of participants. For each task, the metric characteristics of six scoring procedures were evaluated: partial, absolute, partial non-weighted, absolute non-weighted, partial weighted, and absolute weighted scoring. Metric characteristics of all measures were compared across two parallel analyses: with and without application of a typical 85% accuracy criterion on the processing component of the tasks. The study demonstrates that the group administration of span tasks does not compromise their psychometric characteristics. All the tasks had an adequate internal consistency with Cronbach's αs equal to or above .70; the exception being all types of the symmetry span task absolute scores with α values close to .60. Furthermore, all tasks have satisfactory convergent construct validity as well as criterion validity estimated in relation to measures of fluid intelligence. Omitting the 85% accuracy criterion on the processing component of the span tasks did not impair their psychometric properties. Thus, it is recommended that researchers discard this accuracy criterion as a criterion for filtering the results for further statistical analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2897480305,"Previous reports of lung function in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with liver disease have shown worse, similar, or even better forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), compared to CF patients without liver disease. Varying definitions of CF liver disease likely contribute to these inconsistent relationships reported between CF lung function and liver disease. We retrospectively evaluated spirometric data in 179 subjects (62% male; 58% Phe508del homozygous) with severe CF liver disease (CFLD; defined by presence of portal hypertension due to cirrhosis). FEV1 values were referenced to both a normal population (FEV1% predicted) and CF population (CF-specific FEV1 percentile). We utilized a linear mixed model with repeated measures to assess changes in lung function (before and after diagnosis of CFLD), relative to both the normal and CF populations. At diagnosis of CFLD, the mean FEV1 was 81% predicted, or at the 53rd percentile referenced to CF patients without CFLD. There was a significant difference in post-CFLD slope compared to pre-CFLD slope (post–pre) using FEV1% predicted (-1.94, p-value < 0.0001). However, there was insignificant evidence of this difference using the CF-specific FEV1 percentile measure (-0.99, p-value = 0.1268). Although FEV1% predicted values declined in patients following CFLD diagnosis, there was not significant evidence of lung function decline in CF-specific FEV1 percentiles. Thus, the observed study cohort indicates diagnosis of severe CFLD was not associated with worsened CF lung disease when compared to a large CF reference population."

Excessive contents of the above substances can exert adverse effects on soil organisms, reduce biodiversity, and thus deteriorate soil quality. The threat to soil ecosystems within areas particularly exposed to contamination with accumulating chemical compounds was assessed using the Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA) with a multi-stage Triad (triage rapid initial assessment) procedure (taking into account the different lines of evidence). The article presents the results of chemical and ecotoxicological study of soils sampled at sites affected by contamination from petrochemical industry. The study results provided foundations for developing the site specific ERA framework for the area examined."
https://openalex.org/W2896218029,"Catechins, biologically active polyphenols in green tea, exhibit various biological activities, such as anticancer and antiviral activities, arising from interactions with functional proteins. However, the molecular details of these interactions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the interactions between human serum albumin (HSA) and various catechins, including some with a galloyl group, by means of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and docking simulations. Our results indicate that the galloyl group was important for recognition by HSA and was responsible for enthalpic gains derived from a larger buried surface area and more van der Waals contacts. Thus, our thermodynamic and computational analyses suggest that the galloyl group plays important functional roles in the specific binding of catechins to proteins, implying that the biological activities of these compounds may be due in part to the physicochemical characteristics of the galloyl group."
https://openalex.org/W2896416531,"Several studies have shown that communicative language production as compared to non-communicative language production recruits parts of the mentalizing or theory of mind network, yet the exact role of this network in communication remains underspecified. In this study, we therefore aimed to test under what conditions the mentalizing network contributes to communicative language production. We were especially interested in distinguishing between situations in which speakers have to consider which information they do or do not share with their addressee (common vs. privileged ground information). We therefore manipulated whether speakers had to distinguish between common and privileged ground in order to communicate efficiently with the listener, in addition to comparing language production in a communicative and a non-communicative context. Participants performed a referential communicative game in the MRI-scanner as well as a similar, non-communicative task. We found that the medial prefrontal cortex, a core region of the mentalizing network, is especially sensitive to communicative contexts in which speakers have to take their addressee’s needs into account in order to communicate efficiently. In addition, we found neural differences between the communicative and the non-communicative settings before speakers started to plan their utterances, suggesting that they continuously update common ground in a communicative context."
https://openalex.org/W2896257783,"Human neurodegenerative disorders affect specific types of cortical neurons. Efficient protocols for the generation of such neurons for cell replacement, disease modeling and drug screening are highly warranted. Current methods for the production of cortical neurons from human embryonic stem (ES) cells are often time-consuming and inefficient, and the functional properties of the generated cells have been incompletely characterized. Here we have used transcription factor (TF) programming with the aim to induce rapid differentiation of human ES cells to layer-specific cortical neurons (hES-iNs). Three different combinations of TFs, NEUROGENIN 2 (NGN2) only, NGN2 plus Forebrain Embryonic Zinc Finger-Like Protein 2 (FEZF2), and NGN2 plus Special AT-Rich Sequence-Binding Protein 2 (SATB2), were delivered to human ES cells by lentiviral vectors. We observed only subtle differences between the TF combinations, which all gave rise to the formation of pyramidal-shaped cells, morphologically resembling adult human cortical neurons expressing cortical projection neuron (PN) markers and with mature electrophysiological properties. Using ex vivo transplantation to human organotypic cultures, we found that the hES-iNs could integrate into adult human cortical networks. We obtained no evidence that the hES-iNs had acquired a distinct cortical layer phenotype. Instead, our single-cell data showed that the hES-iNs, similar to fetal human cortical neurons, expressed both upper and deep layer cortical neuronal markers. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that TF programming can direct human ES cells towards cortical neurons but that the generated cells are transcriptionally profiled to generate both upper and deep layer cortical neurons. Therefore, most likely additional cues will be needed if these cells should adopt a specific cortical layer and area identity."
https://openalex.org/W2897281793,"RAP1, a component of the telomere-protective shelterin complex, has been shown to have both telomeric and non-telomeric roles. In the liver, RAP1 is involved in the regulation of metabolic transcriptional programs. RAP1-deficient mice develop obesity and hepatic steatosis, these phenotypes being more severe in females than in males. As hepatic steatosis and obesity have been related to increased liver cancer in mice and humans, we set out to address whether RAP1 deficiency resulted in increased liver cancer upon chemical liver carcinogenesis. We found that Rap1-/- females were more susceptible to DEN-induced liver damage and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DEN-treated Rap1-/- female livers showed an earlier onset of both premalignant and malignant liver lesions, which were characterized by increased abundance of γH2AX-positive cells, increased proliferation and shorter telomeres. These findings highlight an important role for RAP1 in protection from liver damage and liver cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2896725696,"Spatiotemporal nonstationarity and autocorrelation are two crucial points in modeling geographical data. Previous studies have demonstrated that geographically and temporally weighted autoregressive (GTWAR) model accounts for both spatiotemporal nonstationarity and autocorrelation simultaneously to estimate house prices. Therefore, this paper proposes a kernel-based GTWAR (KBGTWAR) model by incorporating the basic principle of support vector machine regression into spatially and temporally varying coefficients model. The efficacy of KBGTWAR model is demonstrated through a case study on housing prices in the city of Shenzhen, China, from year 2004 to 2008. Comparing the existing models, KBGTWAR model obtains the lowest value for the residual sum of squares (RSS) and the highest value for the coefficient of determination R2. Moreover, KBGTWAR model improves the goodness of fit of the existing GTWAR model from 12.0 to 4.5 in terms of RSS, from 0.914 to 0.968 in terms of R2 and from 3.84 to 4.45 in terms of F-statistic. The results show that KBGTWAR model provides a comparatively high goodness of fit and sufficient explanatory power for both spatiotemporal nonstationarity and autocorrelation. The results of this study demonstrate that the proposed KBGTWAR model can be used to effectively formulate polices for real estate management."
https://openalex.org/W2897858937,"Introduction Family and friends of seriously ill patients are key partners in providing support and health care at home, managing relationships with clinicians, and navigating complex health care systems. Becoming a knowledgeable, confident, and effective caregiver is a developmental process we term 'caregiver activation' and could be facilitated by clinicians equipped with suitable tools. Managing Your Loved One’s Health (MYLOH) is a new tool to identify gaps in caregivers' knowledge, skills, and access to clinical and personal support. Created in partnership with caregivers and clinicians, MYLOH items reflect the essential dimensions of caregiving and can be used to tailor caregiver coaching to domains of greatest need. In this study, we extend MYLOH's initial focus on dementia care to caregivers of patients with other chronic life-limiting illnesses. Methods MYLOH was completed by primary caregivers (n = 190) of people with a range of advanced chronic illnesses enrolled in the LifeCourse study, an innovative, whole-person approach to health management. Item relevance and responses were compared by group across MYLOH items and domains using z-tests for equality of proportions. Results All MYLOH items were relevant to caregiving for all types of chronic illness; only 13% of caregivers answered “not my responsibility” to any question. MYLOH identified caregiving struggles across patient diagnosis groups with a few, disease-specific ‘hotspots’. Overall, 64% of caregivers scored low in activation on at least one healthcare management task, especially getting enough help with caregiving, managing everyday caregiving tasks, understanding/managing medications, and knowing how to respond to rapid changes in care recipients' health status. No difficulty was unique to a specific type of care recipient illness. Conclusions MYLOH has potential as a tool for identifying caregiver coaching and support needs in managing a range of serious chronic illnesses. Caregiving difficulties endorsed by over 20% of caregivers should be core components of chronic illness management programs regardless of disease focus, with disease-specific tailoring as required. MYLOH may be useful in evaluating caregiver interventions and health systems’ performance in integrating caregivers into the care management of patients with complex life-limiting illness."
https://openalex.org/W2897994399,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a marked complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and multiple organs can be affected by cGVHD-induced inflammation and fibrosis. In clinical settings, immunosuppressive agents have been the last resort to treat cGVHD. However, it has been only partially effective for cGVHD. Hence, efficacious treatment of cGVHD is eagerly awaited. Our previous work suggested that oxidative stress was elevated in cGVHD-disordered lacrimal glands and that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was implicated in fibrosis caused by ocular cGVHD. In addition, our recent article demonstrated that thioredoxin interaction protein (TXNIP) and transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-훋B) were associated with the development of cGVHD. After our search for effective drugs, we chose tranilast to combat systemic cGVHD. Tranilast is known to (1) act as an inhibitor of the inflammatory molecules TXNIP and NF-κB and (2) exert anti-fibrotic, anti-EMT and anti-oxidative effects. To investigate the effectiveness of tranilast for cGVHD, we used an MHC-compatible, multiple minor histocompatibility antigen-mismatched murine model of cGVHD. Tranilast or a solvent-vehicle were orally given to the allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) recipients from the day before allo-BMT (Day-1) to Day 27 after allo-BMT. Their cGVHD-vulnerable organs were collected Day 28 after allo-BMT and analyzed by using various methods such as histology, immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. As indicated by our results, tranilast alleviated cGVHD-elicited inflammation and fibrosis by suppressing the expression and/or activation of TXNIP and NF-κB and preventing EMT. Taken together, although this strategy may not be a complete cure for cGVHD, tranilast could be a promising medication to ameliorate cGVHD-triggered disabling symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W2896685039,"Regular usage of NaOH/NaClO disinfectants results in high sodium salt and alkalinity of poultry manure. This study compared three amendments: vegetable waste (V), food waste (F) and mature compost (C) for their ability to improve the composting of NaOH/NaClO-contaminated poultry manure. C compost resulted in the highest compost temperatures (p<0.001) and greatest reduction in OM, TC, TN and NH4-N (p<0.05). C and V composts were more efficient at lowering extractable-Na (ext-Na) and electrical conductivity (EC) than F (p<0.05). Maturity was primarily indicated by NH4-N, EC and ext-Na. Bacterial dynamics was profoundly influenced by NH4-N, EC and TC, with the decrease leading to discriminate genera shift from Sinibacillus and Thiopseudomonas to Brevbacterium, Brachybacterium, and Microbacterium. These findings suggest that mature compost was more desirable amendment than vegetable and food waste in the composting of NaOH/NaClO-contaminated poultry manure, and the decrease of ext-Na indicated compost maturity but did not influence bacterial dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2897506778,"The proteotoxic stress response that safeguards the cellular proteome from various stressors was shown to activate NF-κB signaling pathways (NκBS) with an underlying mechanism that is poorly understood. We show here that the TNF-α gene, a pleiotropic NκBS inducer, is a direct target of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1). Human HSF1 drives this process by assembling a multiprotein activation complex at a heat shock element (HSE) located at the 3'-UTR of the TNF-α gene (HSE5). HSF1 associated with the HSE5 at the TNF-α 3'-UTR communicates with the promoter through chromatin looping by recruiting lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 at an adjacent Wnt-responsive element through its transactivation domain. TNF-α thus produced guides the activation of NκBS by acting through TNF-α receptor 1 (TNFR1). Notably, cells with TNFR1-/- background or masked HSE5 through Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats/dead CRISPR-associated protein 9 were defective in NκBS and exhibited marked alteration in cellular biology, which includes loss of ability of cancer cells to migrate, to clear the protein aggregates, and associated toxicity upon heat shock. For the first time, our results suggest that TNF-α thus produced pioneers the proinflammatory signal during proteotoxic stress response with an important implication for inflammation and cancer.-Ali, A., Biswas, A., Pal, M. HSF1 mediated TNF-α production during proteotoxic stress response pioneers proinflammatory signal in human cells."
https://openalex.org/W2897551749,"In this paper the possibility of classification of X-ray images of the cervical vertebrae is studied. The images should be classified into one of the following classes—the images of healthy vertebrae and the images of vertebrae with syndesmophytes. The vertebra contours, described unambiguously by using the generalized shape language, are the basis of the analysis. As a result, the contour is represented as a chain of sinquads that determine switches. The found switches are the characteristic points of the analyzed contour. In these points additional features of the contour are determined. On the basis of these features two aforementioned classes of images are defined as fuzzy sets. Such an approach allows us to create a hierarchical algorithm of classification based on the syntactic and fuzzy description of the contour."

Design A community-based cluster-randomized controlled trial. Setting Twenty-one health centres and health posts in Tabriz, Iran. Participants Of 21 health centres/health posts, 10 were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 11 randomly assigned to the control group. Participants were 185 pregnant women selected from health centre/post registration lists (intervention group: n = 92; control group: n = 93). Interventions The intervention was a customer self-audit based on the CenteringPregnancy® model of prenatal group care. The intervention group attended group support sessions focused on participants’ opinions, questions, and self-management concerns. They also received sessions on experiential learning, coping, problem-solving, and goal-setting by a family health expert, a midwife, and a doctor. Control group participants continued to receive individual care. Primary outcome measures SQ and CQ were assessed using questionnaires. Patients rated the importance and performance of non-health quality dimensions. SQ was calculated as: SQ = 10 − (Importance × Performance). Results Total mean SQ scores were 7.63 (0.91) and 8.91 (0.76) for the control and intervention groups, respectively, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Compared with the control group, the intervention group scored higher on the SQ aspects confidentiality, communication, autonomy, availability of support group, dignity, safety, prevention, and accessibility. Total mean CQ scores for the control and intervention groups were 82.63(7.21) and 87.47 (6.75), respectively, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). After intervention, 82.6% of intervention group participants and 50.5% of control group participants reached the highest stage of self-management, showing an ability to take care of themselves under stress and financial constraints. Conclusions The group prenatal care customer self-audit improved the SQ and CQ of maternity care by increased involvement of participants and giving them active roles in the care process."
https://openalex.org/W2896904299,"Motivation and method Existing rational expectations models cannot satisfactorily explain why political budget manipulations systematically raise re-election chances and only occur in “specific contexts”. This paper offers a theoretical explanation by including unsophisticated voters into an opportunistic political cycle model; unsophisticated voters are unable to take the optimal behaviour of other agents (fully) into account, but may, nonetheless, vaguely suspect government deception. Results First, rationally expected manipulations are, on average, fruitless in equilibrium. By including unsophisticated voters we can, however, corroborate empirically found electoral effects of political budget manipulations. Second, unsophisticated voters become anxious and suspicious in an intransparent or uncertain world, but the government tries to “outperform” their scepticism by increasing budget manipulations in order to appear more competent and, ultimately, increase re-election chances. It is, therefore, not surprising that political budget cycles are observed in countries suffering from intransparencies such as developing countries or new democracies. Third and in addition, the model presented here predicts that political opportunism produces, unintentionally, a countercyclical policy effect in election years, thereby, for instance, alleviating the typical problem of policy procyclicality in developing countries. Additional contribution The paper also offers a theoretical explanation for political distortions found in forecasts by US states. Based on overly optimistic revenue forecasts the incumbent state government can conduct expansionary fiscal policies in order to appear more competent prior to an upcoming election. Since the resulting deficit can only be observed afterwards, the government can effectively circumvent a constitutional balanced budget constraint. As a result, there are political forecast and budget cycles in the state. More generally, however, these findings may also apply to European countries where balanced budget constraints are or will be in place (for instance the debt brakes in Switzerland and Germany); similarly, they apply to the supra-national European Fiscal Compact of the European Union."
https://openalex.org/W2897682259,"Cancer cells, including in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), depend on the hypoxic response to persist in hosts and evade therapy. Accordingly, there is significant interest in drugging cancer-specific hypoxic responses. However, a major challenge in leukemia is identifying differential and druggable hypoxic responses between leukemic and normal cells. Previously, we found that arginase 2 (ARG2), an enzyme of the urea cycle, is overexpressed in CML but not normal progenitors. ARG2 is a target of the hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1-α and HIF2-α), and is required for the generation of polyamines which are required for cell growth. We therefore explored if the clinically-tested arginase inhibitor Nω-hydroxy-nor-arginine (nor-NOHA) would be effective against leukemic cells under hypoxic conditions. Remarkably, nor-NOHA effectively induced apoptosis in ARG2-expressing cells under hypoxia but not normoxia. Co-treatment with nor-NOHA overcame hypoxia-mediated resistance towards BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibitors. While nor-NOHA itself is promising in targeting the leukemia hypoxic response, we unexpectedly found that its anti-leukemic activity was independent of ARG2 inhibition. Genetic ablation of ARG2 using CRISPR/Cas9 had no effect on the viability of leukemic cells and their sensitivity towards nor-NOHA. This discrepancy was further evidenced by the distinct effects of ARG2 knockouts and nor-NOHA on cellular respiration. In conclusion, we show that nor-NOHA has significant but off-target anti-leukemic activity among ARG2-expressing hypoxic cells. Since nor-NOHA has been employed in clinical trials, and is widely used in studies on endothelial dysfunction, immunosuppression and metabolism, the diverse biological effects of nor-NOHA must be cautiously evaluated before attributing its activity to ARG inhibition."

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is commonly used for CVD risk assessment; however, recent research has shown LDL particle (LDL-P) number to be a more sensitive indicator of CVD risk than both LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Described herein are five single stranded DNA aptamers with dissociation constants in the low picomolar range specific to LDL-P and its subfractions. Furthermore, a set of antisense sequences have been developed and characterized that are capable of binding to the best aptamers and undergoing displacement by LDL-P for use in a simple, affordable diagnostic assay."
https://openalex.org/W2895971970,"Vertical vibration (VV) is a whole-body vibration with mechanical loading that commonly used in rehabilitation and sports training to increase athlete muscle strength. Our previous study showed that low-magnitude, low-frequency VV at 8 Hz and 10 Hz increased myoblast myogenesis. Herein, we investigated whether a VV frequency at low-frequency 5-10 Hz has anabolic effects on tenocytes and improves tendon stiffness. In primary tenocytes, 10 Hz VV treatment increased the tenogenic marker gene expression of tenomodulin and extracellular matrix type I collagen but decreased decorin expression. qPCR and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) results showed that TGF-β1 expression was increased in tenocytes after 3 days of 10 Hz VV treatment in vitro and in Achilles tendons after 3 weeks in vivo. Tenomodulin expression and Achilles tendon stiffness were significantly increased in Achilles tendons after 3 weeks in vivo. We also showed that the TGF-β1 receptor inhibitor SB431542 (10 μM) decreased the expression of tenomodulin and type I collagen but increased the decorin expression in tenocytes. These results indicated that the 10 Hz VV stimulated anabolic effects in tenocytes by increasing TGF-β1 expression that subsequently increases the expression of tenomodulin and type I collagen, and increased the Achilles tendon stiffness. This study provides insight into the low-frequency 10 Hz VV treatment improves tendon properties and can minimizes the risk of ligament/tendon reinjure during rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W2896055732,"To compare the costs of a strategy of patient controlled remifentanil versus epidural analgesia for pain relief in labour.We performed a multicentre randomised controlled trial in 15 hospitals in the Netherlands, the RAVEL trial. Costs were analysed from a health care perspective alongside the RAVEL trial.Pregnant women of intermediate to high risk beyond 32 weeks gestation who planned vaginal delivery.Women were randomised before the onset of labour, to receive either patient controlled remifentanil or epidural analgesia when pain relief was requested during labour.Primary outcome for effectiveness was satisfaction with pain relief, expressed as the area under the curve (AUC). A higher AUC represents higher satisfaction with pain relief. Here, we present an economic analysis from a health care perspective including costs from the start of labour to ten days postpartum. Health-care utilization was documented in the Case Report Forms and by administering an additional questionnaire.The costs in the patient controlled remifentanil group (n = 687) and in the epidural group (n = 671) were €2900 versus €3185 respectively (mean difference of -€282 (95% CI -€611 to €47)). The (non-significant) higher costs in the epidural analgesia group could be mainly attributed to higher costs of neonatal admission.From an economic perspective, there is no preferential pain treatment in labouring intermediate to high risk women. Since patient controlled remifentanil is not equivalent to epidural analgesia with respect to AUC for satisfaction with pain relief we recommend epidural analgesia as the method of choice. However, if appropriately counselled on effect and side effects there is, from an economic perspective, no reason to deny women patient controlled remifentanil."
https://openalex.org/W2897010534,"Red Junglefowls (RJFs), the wild progenitor of modern day chickens (DCs), are believed to be in genetic endangerment due to introgression of domestic genes through opportunistic matings with domestic or feral chickens. Previous studies from India reported rare hybridization of RJFs in the wild. However, RJF population genetic structure, pattern of gene flow and their admixture with DC populations are poorly understood at the landscape level. We conducted this study with a large sample size, covering the predicted natural distribution range of RJFs in India. We documented strong evidence of directional gene flow from DCs to free-ranging wild RJFs, with the Northeastern RJF population exhibiting the most genetic variants in their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, indicating it to be the ancestral population from which early radiation may have occurred. The results provide evidence that landscape features do not act as a barrier to gene flow and the distribution pattern could not be explored due to physical sharing or exchange of wild birds in the past when forests were continuous across RJF range in India."
https://openalex.org/W2897047391,"The objective of this study was to identify potential mRNA expression changes in chicken livers associated with environmental exposure to dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDTs). In particular, we focused on genes relating to the immune system and metabolism. We analyzed liver samples from free-ranging chickens in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, for contamination by DDTs. This area predominantly uses DDT in its malaria control program, and homes are sprayed annually with the pesticide. Genes relating to the immune system and metabolism were selected as potential genetic biomarkers that could be linked to higher contamination with DDTs. RT-qPCR analysis on 39 samples showed strong correlations between DDTs contamination and mRNA expression for the following genes: AvBD1, AvBD2, AvBD6 and AvBD7 (down-regulated), and CYP17, ELOVL2 and SQLE (up-regulated). This study shows for the first time interesting and significant correlations between genetic material collected from environmentally-exposed chickens and mRNA expression of several genes involved in immunity and metabolism. These findings show the usefulness of analysis on field samples from a region with high levels of environmental contamination in detecting potential biomarkers of exposure. In particular, we observed clear effects from DDT contamination on mRNA expression of genes involved in immune suppression, endocrine-disrupting effects, and lipid dysregulation. These results are of interest in guiding future studies to further elucidate the pathways involved in and clinical importance of toxicity associated with DDT exposure from contaminated environments, to ascertain the health risk to livestock and any subsequent risks to food security for people."
https://openalex.org/W2953013231,"Cross-sectional correlations between two variables have limited implications for causality. We examine here whether it is possible to make causal inferences from steady-state data in a homeostatic system with three or more inter-correlated variables. Every putative pathway between three variables makes a set of differential predictions that can be tested with steady state data. For example, among 3 variables, A, B and C, the coefficient of determination, is predicted by the product of and for some pathways, but not for others. Residuals from a regression line are independent of residuals from another regression for some pathways, but positively or negatively correlated for certain other pathways. Different pathways therefore have different prediction signatures, which can be used to accept or reject plausible pathways using appropriate null hypotheses. The type 2 error reduces with sample size but the nature of this relationship is different for different predictions. We apply these principles to test the classical pathway leading to a hyperinsulinemic normoglycemic insulin-resistant, or pre-diabetic, state using four different sets of epidemiological data. Currently, a set of indices called HOMA-IR and HOMA-β are used to represent insulin resistance and glucose-stimulated insulin response by β cells respectively. Our analysis shows that if we assume the HOMA indices to be faithful indicators, the classical pathway must in turn be rejected. In effect, among the populations sampled, the classical pathway and faithfulness of the HOMA indices cannot be simultaneously true. The principles and example shows that it is possible to infer causal pathways from cross sectional correlational data on three or more correlated variables."
https://openalex.org/W2895928075,"Raptors are one of the most important causes of fatalities due to their collisions with aircrafts as well as being the main victims of collisions with constructions. They are difficult to deter because they are not influenced by other airspace users or ground predators. Because vision is the primary sensory mode of many diurnal raptors, we evaluated the reactions of captive raptors to a “superstimulus” (a “paradoxical effect whereby animals show greater responsiveness to an exaggerated stimulus than to the natural stimulus”) that combined an “eye shape” stimulus (as many species have an aversion for this type of stimulus) and a looming movement (LE). This looming stimulus mimics an impending collision and induces avoidance in a wide range of species. In captivity, raptors showed a clear aversion for this LE stimulus. We then tested it in a real life setting: at an airport where raptors are abundant. This study is the first to show the efficiency of a visual non-invasive repellent system developed on the basis of both captive and field studies. This system deterred birds of prey and corvids through aversion, and did not induce habituation. These findings suggest applications for human security as well as bird conservation, and further research on avian visual perception and sensitivity to signals."
https://openalex.org/W2897399224,"Competitive runners will occasionally undergo exercise in a laboratory setting to obtain predictive and prescriptive information regarding their performance. The present research aimed to assess whether the physiological demands of lab-based treadmill running (TM) can simulate that of over-ground (OG) running using a commonly used protocol. Fifteen healthy volunteers with a weekly mileage of ≥ 20 km over the past 6 months and treadmill experience participated in this cross-sectional study. Two stepwise incremental tests until volitional exhaustion was performed in a fixed order within one week in an Outpatient Clinic research laboratory and outdoor athletic track. Running velocity (IATspeed), heart rate (IATHR) and lactate concentration at the individual anaerobic threshold (IATbLa) were primary endpoints. Additionally, distance covered (DIST), maximal heart rate (HRmax), maximal blood lactate concentration (bLamax) and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) at IATspeed were analyzed. IATspeed, DIST and HRmax were not statistically significantly different between conditions, whereas bLamax and RPE at IATspeed showed statistical significance (p < 0.05). Apart from RPE at IATspeed, IATspeed, DIST, HRmax and bLamax strongly correlate between conditions (r = 0.815-0.988). High reliability between conditions provides strong evidence to suggest that running on a treadmill are physiologically comparable to that of OG and that training recommendations and be made with assurance."
https://openalex.org/W2896612524,"Exposure to 3,5-dimethylaminophenol (3,5-DMAP), the metabolite of the 3-5-dimethylaniline, was shown to cause high levels of oxidative stress in different cells. The aim of the present work was to observe whether this metabolite can lead to cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, DNA damage and cell cycle changes in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. 3,5-DMAP caused a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity, generation of superoxide (O2-.), inductions in the enzyme activities orchestrating cellular antioxidant balance, increases in lipid peroxidation as well as DNA damage. However, 3,5-DMAP showed significantly lower cytotoxicity towards human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells. 3,5-DMAP also led to molecular events, like inducing apoptotic markers (ie. p53, Bad, Bax and cytochrome c); decreasing anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2) and alterations in cell cycle. Our findings indicate that the cytotoxicity caused by this particular alkylaniline metabolite led to initiation of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, 3,5-DMAP attenuated carcinogenic properties like migration capacity of A549 cells and eventually inhibited growth of A549 cells in an in vivo mouse model. Tumor sections showed that 3,5-DMAP down-regulated c-Myc expression but up-regulated p53 and cytochrome c, all of which might result in tumor growth arrest. Co-treatment with N-acetylcysteine provided reductions in cytotoxicity and positively modulated genetic events induced by 3,5-DMAP in A549 cells. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate 3,5-DMAP may be a potential anti-cancer drug in cancer, due to its self redox cycling properties."
https://openalex.org/W2896802727,"The whooping cough agent Bordetella pertussis coordinately regulates the expression of its virulence factors with the two-component system BvgAS. In laboratory conditions, specific chemical modulators are used to trigger phenotypic modulation of B. pertussis from its default virulent Bvg+ phase to avirulent Bvg- or intermediate Bvgi phases, in which no virulence factors or only a subset of them are produced, respectively. Whether phenotypic modulation occurs in the host remains unknown. In this work, recombinant B. pertussis strains harboring BvgS variants were tested in a mouse model of infection and analyzed using transcriptomic approaches. Recombinant BP-BvgΔ65, which is in the Bvgi phase by default and can be up-modulated to the Bvg+ phase in vitro, could colonize the mouse nose but was rapidly cleared from the lungs, while Bvg+-phase strains colonized both organs for up to four weeks. These results indicated that phenotypic modulation, which might have restored the full virulence capability of BP-BvgΔ65, does not occur in mice or is temporally or spatially restricted and has no effect in those conditions. Transcriptomic analyses of this and other recombinant Bvgi and Bvg+-phase strains revealed that two distinct ranges of virulence gene expression allow colonization of the mouse nose and lungs, respectively. We also showed that a recombinant strain expressing moderately lower levels of the virulence genes than its wild type parent was as efficient at colonizing both organs. Altogether, genetic modifications of BvgS generate a range of phenotypic phases, which are useful tools to decipher host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2898063749,"To evaluate the quantitative computed tomography (QCT) phenotypes, airflow limitations, and exacerbation-like episodes in heavy smokers in Southern Brazil.We enrolled 172 smokers with a smoking history ≥30 pack-years who underwent pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and CT scan for lung cancer screening. Patients were classified regarding airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC <0.7 forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity) and the presence of emphysema on the QCT. The QCT were analyzed in specialized software and patients were classified in two disease-predominant phenotypes: emphysema-predominant (EP) and non-emphysema-predominant (NEP). EP was determined as ≥6% of percent low-attenuation areas (LAA%) with less than -950 Hounsfield units. NEP was defined as having a total LAA% of less than 6%.Most of our patients were classified in the EP phenotype. The EP group had significantly worse predicted FEV1 (60.6 ±22.9 vs. 89.7 ±15.9, p <0.001), higher rates of airflow limitation (85.7% vs. 15%; p <0.001), and had more exacerbation-like episodes (25.8% vs. 8.3%, p <0.001) compared to the NEP group. Smoking history, ethnicity, and BMI did not differ between the groups. The total LAA% was the QCT parameter with the strongest correlation to FEV1 (r = -0.669) and FEV1/FVC (r = -0.787).Heavy smokers with the EP phenotype on QCT were more likely to have airflow limitation, worse predicted FEV1, and a higher rate of exacerbation-like episodes than those with the NEP phenotype. Approximately 23% of patients with no airflow limitation on PFTs were classified in EP phenotype."

But tracking such dependencies in natural languages entails being able to generalize dependencies to novel contexts ('The general is angrily berating his troops'), and also tracking co-occurrence patterns between functional morphemes like is and ing (a class of elements that often lack perceptual salience). We use the Headturn Preference Procedure to investigate (i) whether infants are capable of generalizing dependencies to novel contexts, and (ii) whether they can track dependencies between perceptually non-salient elements in an artificial grammar aXb. Results suggest that 18-month-olds extract abstract knowledge of a_b dependencies between non-salient a and b elements and use this knowledge to subsequently re-familiarize themselves with specific ai_bi combinations. However, they show no evidence of generalizing ai_bi dependencies to novel aiYbi strings."

https://openalex.org/W2896242746,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can interfere with smooth pursuit or with saccades initiated from a fixed position toward a fixed target, but little is known about the effect of TMS on catch-up saccade made to assist smooth pursuit. Here we explored the effect of TMS on catch-up saccades by means of a situation in which the moving target was driven by an external agent, or moved by the participants' hand, a condition known to decrease the occurrence of catch-up saccade. Two sites of stimulation were tested, the vertex and M1 hand area. Compared to conditions with no TMS, we found a consistent modulation of saccadic activity after TMS such that it decreased at 40-100ms, strongly resumed at 100-160ms, and then decreased at 200-300ms. Despite this modulatory effect, the accuracy of catch-up saccade was maintained, and the mean saccadic activity over the 0-300ms period remained unchanged. Those findings are discussed in the context of studies showing that single-pulse TMS can induce widespread effects on neural oscillations as well as perturbations in the latency of saccades during reaction time protocols. At a more general level, despite challenges and interpretational limitations making uncertain the origin of this modulatory effect, our study provides direct evidence that TMS over presumably non-oculomotor regions interferes with the initiation of catch-up saccades, and thus offers methodological considerations for future studies that wish to investigate the underlying neural circuitry of catch-up saccades using TMS."

The abstracts submitted for presentation in scientific congresses are usually vetted for any indication of commercial bias. Members of review program committees regularly have recognized qualifications, and therefore certain COI are unavoidable. This study aims to determine the prevalence and magnitude of possible COI among those responsible for the selection of presentations at two important international conferences on spine surgery during a five-year period.COI declarations by those responsible for the final programs of the annual SRS (Scoliosis Research Society) and IMAST (International Meeting of Advanced Spine Technologies) conferences from 2010 to 2014 were collected and analyzed from data published by the corresponding scientific programs. The SRS's disclosure index did not contain financial amounts; therefore, this aspect could not be analyzed.Five scientific committees and 117 members (76 individuals) were studied. Of these 76, 41 (53.9%) participated in more than one conflict of interest (>1 COI). Scientific committee members were from 11 countries across 4 continents, but most were from the Unites States (76.9%). Of the 117 program reviewers, 65.8% declared >1 COI and 34.2% reported no COI. The 77 program reviewers who disclosed a potential COI declared a total of 273 COI (mean = 3.54 COI/member). Overall, 36.0%, 26.1%, 10.7%, and 10.7% of the COI corresponded to consultancies, research funds, bureau participation, and advisory board panel participation, respectively.
