https://openalex.org/W2093966979,"A chronology of the initiation dates of major continental flood basalt volcanism is established from published potassium-argon (K-Ar) and argon-argon (Ar-Ar) ages of basaltic rocks and related basic intrusions. The dating is therefore independent of the biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic time scales. Estimated errors of the initiation dates of the volcanic episodes determined from the distributions of the radiometric ages are, approximately, plus or minus 4 percent. There were 11 distinct episodes during the past 250 million years. Sometimes appearing in pairs, the episodes have occurred quasi-periodically with a mean cycle time of 32 ± 1 (estimated, error of the mean) million years. The initiation dates of the episodes are close to the estimated dates of mass extinctions of marine organisms. Showers of impacting comets may be the cause."
https://openalex.org/W2009670069,"Spectra of the region just above the bright limb of the Moon show weak emission features that are attributed to resonant scattering of sunlight from sodium and potassium vapor in the lunar atmosphere. The maximum omnidirectional emission flux above the bright limb is 3.8 +/- 0.4 kilorayleighs for sodium and 1.8 +/- 0.4 kiloray-leighs for potassium. The zenith column densities above the subsolar point are estimated to be 8 +/- 3 x 10(8) atoms cm(-2) for sodium 1.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) atoms cm(-2) for potassium. Corresponding surface densities are 67 +/- 12 atoms cm(-3) and 15 +/- 3 atoms cm(-3), respectively. The scale height for the sodium atmosphere is 120 +/- 42 kilometers, and for potassium 90 +/- 20 kilometers, which implies that the effective temperature of the sodium and potassium is close to the lunar surface temperature. The sodium density at the south polar region was found to be similar to that at the subsolar point, indicating wide-spread distribution of sodium vapor over the lunar surface. The ratio of the density of sodium to the density of potassium is (6 +/- 3) to 1, which is close to the sodium to potassium ratio in the lunar surface, suggesting that the atmosphere originates from the vaporization of surface minerals."

The high curvatures of these structures are especially suitable for experimentally verifying the predicted proportionality between the velocity and the shape of traveling waves. A computerized spectrophotometric video technique with microscopic resolution was used to determine the proportionality factor (2 × 10-5 square centimeter per second), which in this case is the diffusion coefficient of the autocatalytic species of the reaction system. A numerical calculation of the spatiotemporal evolution of the cusp structure is in good agreement with the experimental observations."

Fourteen x-ray reflections of the high-pressure FeS were recorded; however, the crystal structure is unknown. This form of FeS is stable at 25 degrees C only at pressures above approximately 55 kilobars. The transition to the lower pressure polymorph, troilite, is rapid and reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2050389032,The behavior of 12 male cats was observed before and after six or eight daily injections of parachlorophenylalanine. Sexual performance was either unchanged or diminished; aggressive behavior was not seen. Serotonin concentrations in the brains were uniformly lowered.
https://openalex.org/W1969759974,"Elemental abundance (20 trace elements, 3 major elements) comparisons for Ivory Coast microtektites and Australasian microtektites indicate that there are distinct chemical similarities between microtektites and nearby tektites. Several trace element abundances in microtektites are quite different from those observed in Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 samples."

https://openalex.org/W2051344468,"When relatively clean country air is exposed to the saturated vapor of iodine or turpentine, very large numbers of condensation nuclei develop. It is believed that such air contains clusters of molecules that are polymerized by the vapor of turpentine or iodine to form nuclei."

Its relationship to the Plio-Pleistocene boundary and to other criteria used to define this boundary is examined, with the result that a strict adherence to the classical definition is urged."
https://openalex.org/W2085387026,"The drying up of flooded lowlands stranded eggs of Fundulus confluentus, which were unhatched and viable after as much as 3 months' exposure. The eggs were found in the moist plant debris on the soil surface. When ovigerous sods were immersed in tap water, normal fish hatched within 15 to 30 minutes."
