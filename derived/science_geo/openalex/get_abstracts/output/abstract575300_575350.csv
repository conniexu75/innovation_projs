Boland et al. added graphene to a lightly cross-linked silicone polymer (also known as Silly Putty). The resulting composite has unusual mechanical properties, allowing the manufacture of strain sensors that can detect respiration and the footsteps of spiders. Science , this issue p. 1257"

These factors have led to the use of mobile money, whereby money can be deposited to an account linked to a phone, transferred to other users, and converted back into cash. Suri and Jack show that increased access to mobile money has increased long-term consumption in Kenya and reduced the number of households in extreme poverty. Science , this issue p. 1288"

Reid et al. performed a genomic analysis of killifish, geographically separate and independent populations of which have adapted recently to severe pollution (see the Perspective by Tobler and Culumber). Sequencing multiple sensitive and resistant populations revealed signals of selective sweeps for variants that may confer tolerance to toxins, some of which were shared between resistant populations. Thus, high genetic diversity in killifish seems to allow selection to act on existing variation, driving rapid adaptation to selective forces such as pollution.

https://openalex.org/W2561545741,"Hippocampal replay during sharp-wave ripple events (SWRs) is thought to drive memory consolidation in hippocampal and cortical circuits. Changes in neocortical activity can precede SWR events, but whether and how these changes influence the content of replay remains unknown. Here we show that during sleep there is a rapid cortical-hippocampal-cortical loop of information flow around the times of SWRs. We recorded neural activity in auditory cortex (AC) and hippocampus of rats as they learned a sound-guided task and during sleep. We found that patterned activation in AC precedes and predicts the subsequent content of hippocampal activity during SWRs, while hippocampal patterns during SWRs predict subsequent AC activity. Delivering sounds during sleep biased AC activity patterns, and sound-biased AC patterns predicted subsequent hippocampal activity. These findings suggest that activation of specific cortical representations during sleep influences the identity of the memories that are consolidated into long-term stores."

https://openalex.org/W2566901884,"Charles Roberts and colleagues show that deletion of Arid1a from mouse intestinal epithelium results in invasive adenocarcinomas resembling human colorectal cancer. They further show that ARID1A loss impairs SWI/SNF targeting and enhancer-mediated gene regulation. Genes encoding subunits of SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes are collectively mutated in ∼20% of all human cancers1,2. Although ARID1A is the most frequent target of mutations, the mechanism by which its inactivation promotes tumorigenesis is unclear. Here we demonstrate that Arid1a functions as a tumor suppressor in the mouse colon, but not the small intestine, and that invasive ARID1A-deficient adenocarcinomas resemble human colorectal cancer (CRC). These tumors lack deregulation of APC/β-catenin signaling components, which are crucial gatekeepers in common forms of intestinal cancer. We find that ARID1A normally targets SWI/SNF complexes to enhancers, where they function in coordination with transcription factors to facilitate gene activation. ARID1B preserves SWI/SNF function in ARID1A-deficient cells, but defects in SWI/SNF targeting and control of enhancer activity cause extensive dysregulation of gene expression. These findings represent an advance in colon cancer modeling and implicate enhancer-mediated gene regulation as a principal tumor-suppressor function of ARID1A."
https://openalex.org/W2563878885,"SMARCB1 (also known as SNF5, INI1, and BAF47), a core subunit of the SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complex, is inactivated in nearly all pediatric rhabdoid tumors. These aggressive cancers are among the most genomically stable, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism by which SMARCB1 loss drives transformation. Here we show that, despite having indistinguishable mutational landscapes, human rhabdoid tumors exhibit distinct enhancer H3K27ac signatures, which identify remnants of differentiation programs. We show that SMARCB1 is required for the integrity of SWI/SNF complexes and that its loss alters enhancer targeting-markedly impairing SWI/SNF binding to typical enhancers, particularly those required for differentiation, while maintaining SWI/SNF binding at super-enhancers. We show that these retained super-enhancers are essential for rhabdoid tumor survival, including some that are shared by all subtypes, such as SPRY1, and other lineage-specific super-enhancers, such as SOX2 in brain-derived rhabdoid tumors. Taken together, our findings identify a new chromatin-based epigenetic mechanism underlying the tumor-suppressive activity of SMARCB1."

However, organisms do not work like clocks, and our judgment about the passage of time is variable, depending on circumstances.

https://openalex.org/W2567190685,"The opposition between Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) and BAF (mSWI/SNF) complexes has a critical role in both development and disease. Mutations in the genes encoding BAF subunits contribute to more than 20% of human malignancies, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, owing largely to a lack of assays to assess BAF function in living cells. To address this, we have developed a widely applicable recruitment assay system through which we find that BAF opposes PRC by rapid, ATP-dependent eviction, leading to the formation of accessible chromatin. The reversal of this process results in reassembly of facultative heterochromatin. Surprisingly, BAF-mediated PRC eviction occurs in the absence of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy, transcription, and replication. Further, we find that tumor-suppressor and oncogenic mutant BAF complexes have different effects on PRC eviction. The results of these studies define a mechanistic sequence underlying the resolution and formation of facultative heterochromatin, and they demonstrate that BAF opposes PRC on a minute-by-minute basis to provide epigenetic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2559981943,"Birds of a feather sing together How do birds know that a song that they hear is from a member of their own species, and how do they learn their songs in the first place? Araki et al. identified two types of brain cells involved in how finches learn their songs (see the Perspective by Tchernichovski and Lipkind). When zebra finches were raised by Bengalese finch foster parents, they learned a song whose morphology resembled that of their foster father. However, the temporal structure remained zebra finch–specific, suggesting that it is innate. Gadagkar et al. recorded activity in specific dopamine neurons in singing zebra finches while controlling perceived song quality with distorted auditory feedback. This distorted feedback represented worse performance than predicted and resulted in negative prediction errors. These findings suggest again that finches have an innate internal goal for their learned songs. Science , this issue p. 1282 , p. 1234 ; see also p. 1278"
https://openalex.org/W2567382369,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), therapy resistance frequently occurs, leading to high mortality among patients. However, the mechanisms that render leukemic cells drug resistant remain largely undefined. Here, we identified loss of the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and subsequent reduction of histone H3K27 trimethylation as a novel pathway of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and cytotoxic drugs in AML. Low EZH2 protein levels correlated with poor prognosis in AML patients. Suppression of EZH2 protein expression induced chemoresistance of AML cell lines and primary cells in vitro and in vivo. Low EZH2 levels resulted in derepression of HOX genes, and knockdown of HOXB7 and HOXA9 in the resistant cells was sufficient to improve sensitivity to TKIs and cytotoxic drugs. The endogenous loss of EZH2 expression in resistant cells and primary blasts from a subset of relapsed AML patients resulted from enhanced CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of EZH2 at Thr487. This interaction was stabilized by heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and followed by proteasomal degradation of EZH2 in drug-resistant cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of HSP90, CDK1 and the proteasome prevented EZH2 degradation, decreased HOX gene expression and restored drug sensitivity. Finally, patients with reduced EZH2 levels at progression to standard therapy responded to the combination of bortezomib and cytarabine, concomitant with the re-establishment of EZH2 expression and blast clearance. These data suggest restoration of EZH2 protein as a viable approach to overcome treatment resistance in this AML patient population."

With that flexibility in mind, Schmidt et al. show that nickel complexes can catalyze asymmetric alkylation of carbon centers adjacent to boron. This protocol creates chiral alkylboronates that function as stable precursors to numerous complex molecules. The reaction proceeds in stereo-convergent fashion—forming a single product from either mirror image of the α-haloboronate reagent. Successive reactions can also create chains of adjacent chiral alkyl centers with stereochemistry set by the configuration of the ligand bound to nickel. Science , this issue p. 1265"

https://openalex.org/W2566164336,"Trithorax-group proteins and their mammalian homologs, including those in BAF (mSWI/SNF) complexes, are known to oppose the activity of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). This opposition underlies the tumor-suppressive role of BAF subunits and is expected to contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying opposition to Polycomb silencing are poorly understood. Here we report that recurrent disease-associated mutations in BAF subunits induce genome-wide increases in PRC deposition and activity. We show that point mutations in SMARCA4 (also known as BRG1) mapping to the ATPase domain cause loss of direct binding between BAF and PRC1 that occurs independently of chromatin. Release of this direct interaction is ATP dependent, consistent with a transient eviction mechanism. Using a new chemical-induced proximity assay, we find that BAF directly evicts Polycomb factors within minutes of its occupancy, thereby establishing a new mechanism for the widespread BAF-PRC opposition underlying development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2566700840,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are being pursued as a source of cells for autologous therapies, many of which will be aimed at aged patients. To explore the impact of age on iPSC quality, we produced iPSCs from blood cells of 16 donors aged 21-100. We find that iPSCs from older donors retain an epigenetic signature of age, which can be reduced through passaging. Clonal expansion via reprogramming also enables the discovery of somatic mutations present in individual donor cells, which are missed by bulk sequencing methods. We show that exomic mutations in iPSCs increase linearly with age, and all iPSC lines analyzed carry at least one gene-disrupting mutation, several of which have been associated with cancer or dysfunction. Unexpectedly, elderly donors (>90 yrs) harbor fewer mutations than predicted, likely due to a contracted blood progenitor pool. These studies establish that donor age is associated with an increased risk of abnormalities in iPSCs and will inform clinical development of reprogramming technology."
https://openalex.org/W2563585356,"Excluding the ribosome and riboswitches, developing small molecules that selectively target RNA is a longstanding problem in chemical biology. A typical cellular RNA is difficult to target because it has little tertiary, but abundant secondary structure. We designed allele-selective compounds that target such an RNA, the toxic noncoding repeat expansion (r(CUG)exp) that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). We developed several strategies to generate allele-selective small molecules, including non-covalent binding, covalent binding, cleavage and on-site probe synthesis. Covalent binding and cleavage enabled target profiling in cells derived from individuals with DM1, showing precise recognition of r(CUG)exp. In the on-site probe synthesis approach, small molecules bound adjacent sites in r(CUG)exp and reacted to afford picomolar inhibitors via a proximity-based click reaction only in DM1-affected cells. We expanded this approach to image r(CUG)exp in its natural context."
https://openalex.org/W2564544913,"Excess levels of protein in urine (proteinuria) is a hallmark of kidney disease that typically occurs in conjunction with diabetes, hypertension, gene mutations, toxins or infections but may also be of unknown cause (idiopathic). Systemic soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a circulating factor implicated in the onset and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The cellular source(s) of elevated suPAR associated with future and progressing kidney disease is unclear, but is likely extra-renal, as the pathological uPAR is circulating and FSGS can recur even after a damaged kidney is replaced with a healthy donor organ. Here we report that bone marrow (BM) Gr-1lo immature myeloid cells are responsible for the elevated, pathological levels of suPAR, as evidenced by BM chimera and BM ablation and cell transfer studies. A marked increase of Gr-1lo myeloid cells was commonly found in the BM of proteinuric animals having high suPAR, and these cells efficiently transmit proteinuria when transferred to healthy mice. In accordance with the results seen in suPAR-associated proteinuric animal models, in which kidney damage is caused not by local podocyte-selective injury but more likely by systemic insults, a humanized xenograft model of FSGS resulted in an expansion of Gr-1lo cells in the BM, leading to high plasma suPAR and proteinuric kidney disease. Together, these results identify suPAR as a functional connection between the BM and the kidney, and they implicate BM immature myeloid cells as a key contributor to glomerular dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2560750880,"Beating the curse of the parasite The evolution of molecular replicators was a critical step in the origin of life. Such replicators would have suffered from faster-replicating “molecular parasites” outcompeting the parental replicator. Compartmentalization of replicators inside protocells would have helped ameliorate the effect of parasites. Matsumura et al. show that transient compartmentalization in nonbiological materials is sufficient to tame the problem of parasite takeover. They analyzed viral replication in a droplet-based microfluidic system, which revealed that as long as there is selection for a functional replicator, the population is not overwhelmed by the faster-replicating parasite genomes.

https://openalex.org/W2563700816,"New therapeutic approaches are needed to treat leukemia effectively. Dietary restriction regimens, including fasting, have been considered for the prevention and treatment of certain solid tumor types. However, whether and how dietary restriction affects hematopoietic malignancies is unknown. Here we report that fasting alone robustly inhibits the initiation and reverses the leukemic progression of both B cell and T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL and T-ALL, respectively), but not acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in mouse models of these tumors. Mechanistically, we found that attenuated leptin-receptor (LEPR) expression is essential for the development and maintenance of ALL, and that fasting inhibits ALL development by upregulation of LEPR and its downstream signaling through the protein PR/SET domain 1 (PRDM1). The expression of LEPR signaling-related genes correlated with the prognosis of pediatric patients with pre-B-ALL, and fasting effectively inhibited B-ALL growth in a human xenograft model. Our results indicate that the effects of fasting on tumor growth are cancer-type dependent, and they suggest new avenues for the development of treatment strategies for leukemia."
https://openalex.org/W2566744224,"The mechanisms of initiation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are still largely unknown. In the present study, we analysed the role of anterior gradient-2 (AGR2) in the earliest stages of pancreatic neoplasia. Immunohistochemical analysis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) and peritumoral areas in PDAC tissues showed that AGR2 was present in tubular complexes (TC) and early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs). Moreover, AGR2 was also found in discrete subpopulations of non-transformed cells neighbouring these pre-neoplastic lesions. In primary cells derived from human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, flow-cytometry revealed that AGR2 was overexpressed in pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSC) compared with non-stem cancer cells. In LSL-KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre (KC) mouse model Agr2 induction preceded the formation of pre-neoplastic lesions and their development was largely inhibited by Agr2 deletion in engineered LSL-KrasG12D;Pdx1-Cre; Agr2−/− mice. In vitro, AGR2 expression was stimulated by tunicamycin-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in both KRAS wild-type normal pancreas cells, as well as in KRAS mutated pancreatic cancer cells and was essential for ER homoeostasis. The unfolded protein response proteins GRP78, ATF6 and XBP1s were found expressed in CP and PDAC peritumoral tissues, but in contrast to AGR2, their expression was switched off during TC and PanIN formation. Real-time PCR and ELISA analyses showed that ER stress induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in pancreatic normal, cancer and stellate cells. Moreover, AGR2 expression was inducible by paracrine transfer of ER stress and pro-inflammation between different pancreatic cell types. Our findings demonstrate that AGR2 induced in ER-stressed and inflammatory pre-neoplastic pancreas is a potential marker of cancer progenitor cells with an important functional role in PDAC initiation."

If two large fragments of a molecule are not properly oriented, it is not typically possible to break them apart, rotate one, and then paste them back together. Yet that is precisely the trick that Keylor et al. used to synthesize two plant-derived polyphenols. Resveratrol forms a variety of dimers, trimers, and tetramers. When one central carbon-carbon bond links the fragments, it is weak enough to break spontaneously and reversibly at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W2564978332,"c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) plays a vital role in malignant transformation of different cancers, and JNK is highly activated in basal-like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). However, the roles of JNK in regulating cancer stem-like cell (CSC) phenotype and tumorigenesis in TNBC are not well defined. JNK is known to mediate many cellular events via activating c-Jun. Here, we found that JNK regulated c-Jun activation in TNBC cells and that JNK activation correlated with c-Jun activation in TNBC tumors. Furthermore, the expression level of c-Jun was significantly higher in TNBC tumors than in non-TNBC tumors, and high c-Jun mRNA level was associated with shorter disease-free survival of patients with TNBC. Thus, we hypothesized that the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway contributes to TNBC tumorigenesis. We found that knockdown of JNK1 or JNK2 or treatment with JNK-IN-8, an adenosine triphosphate-competitive irreversible pan-JNK inhibitor, significantly reduced cell proliferation, the ALDH1+ and CD44+/CD24− CSC subpopulations, and mammosphere formation, indicating that JNK promotes CSC self-renewal and maintenance in TNBC. We further demonstrated that both JNK1 and JNK2 regulated Notch1 transcription via activation of c-Jun and that the JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway promoted CSC phenotype through Notch1 signaling in TNBC. In a TNBC xenograft mouse model, JNK-IN-8 significantly suppressed tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting acquisition of the CSC phenotype. Taken together, our data demonstrate that JNK regulates TNBC tumorigenesis by promoting CSC phenotype through Notch1 signaling via activation of c-Jun and indicate that JNK/c-Jun/Notch1 signaling is a potential therapeutic target for TNBC."

One of these molecules was effective in silencing touch receptors and reversed touch-evoked pain associated with nerve injury or diabetic neuropathy. The skin is equipped with specialized mechanoreceptors that allow the perception of the slightest brush. Indeed, some mechanoreceptors can detect even nanometer-scale movements. Movement is transformed into electrical signals via the gating of mechanically activated ion channels at sensory endings in the skin. The sensitivity of Piezo mechanically gated ion channels is controlled by stomatin-like protein-3 (STOML3), which is required for normal mechanoreceptor function. Here we identify small-molecule inhibitors of STOML3 oligomerization that reversibly reduce the sensitivity of mechanically gated currents in sensory neurons and silence mechanoreceptors in vivo. STOML3 inhibitors in the skin also reversibly attenuate fine touch perception in normal mice. Under pathophysiological conditions following nerve injury or diabetic neuropathy, the slightest touch can produce pain, and here STOML3 inhibitors can reverse mechanical hypersensitivity. Thus, small molecules applied locally to the skin can be used to modulate touch and may represent peripherally available drugs to treat tactile-driven pain following neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2563595740,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition is a common event during tumour dissemination. However, direct epithelial to amoeboid transition has not been characterized to date. Here we provide evidence that cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a highly metastatic cancer, undergo epithelial to amoeboid transition in physiological environments, such as organoids or three-dimensional complex matrices. Furthermore, the NADPH oxidase NOX4 inhibits this transition and therefore suppresses efficient amoeboid bleb-based invasion. Moreover, NOX4 expression is associated with E-cadherin levels and inversely correlated with invasive features. NOX4 is necessary to maintain parenchymal structures, increase cell-cell and cell-to-matrix adhesion, and impair actomyosin contractility and amoeboid invasion. Importantly, NOX4 gene deletions are frequent in HCC patients, correlating with higher tumour grade. Contrary to that observed in mesenchymal cell types, here NOX4 suppresses Rho and Cdc42 GTPase expression and downstream actomyosin contractility. In HCC patients, NOX4 expression inversely correlates with RhoC and Cdc42 levels. Moreover, low expression of NOX4 combined with high expression of either RhoC or Cdc42 is associated with worse prognosis. Therefore, loss of NOX4 increases actomyosin levels and favours an epithelial to amoeboid transition contributing to tumour aggressiveness."

Behavioral learning and neuronal coding of temporal gap structure resisted song tutoring from other species: Zebra finches fostered by Bengalese finch parents learned Bengalese finch song morphology transposed onto zebra finch temporal gaps. During the vocal learning period, temporal gap neurons fired selectively to zebra finch song.

KPNA4 mediates the cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation of transcription factors, including nuclear factor kappa B, although its role in PCa was largely unknown. We find that knockdown of KPNA4 reduces cell migration in multiple PCa cell lines, suggesting a role of KPNA4 in PCa progression. Indeed, stable knockdown of KPNA4 significantly reduces PCa invasion and distant metastasis in mouse models.

Here, we investigated the signaling regulation of a splice variant of the estrogen receptor, namely estrogen receptor (ERα-36), associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancers. Coupling in vitro and in vivo approaches we determined the precise sequential molecular events of a new estrogen signaling network in an ERα-negative cell line and in an original patient-derived xenograft. After estrogen treatment, ERα-36 rapidly associates with Src at the level of the plasma membrane, initiating downstream cascades, including MEK1/ERK activation and paxillin phosphorylation on S126, which in turn triggers a higher expression of cyclin D1. Of note, the direct binding of ERα-36 to ERK2 prevents its dephosphorylation by MKP3 and enhances the downstream signaling. These findings improve our understanding of the regulation of non-genomic estrogen signaling and open new avenues for personalized therapeutic approaches targeting Src or MEK in ERα-36-positive patients."

Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates–at the interface between cell signalling and membrane traffic.EMBO J. 2016; 35: 561-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, some studies implicate class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) isoforms (PI3K-C2α/β/γ) in the receptor-triggered accumulation of PI3P at the plasma membrane of various cell types (19Brown R.A. Domin J. Arcaro A. Waterfield M.D. Shepherd P.R. Insulin activates the α isoform of class II phosphoinositide 3-kinase.J. Biol.

Commun. 2003; 306: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar); however, unequivocal evidence for the presence of PI3P at the neuronal plasma membrane is presently lacking. Thus, it remains unclear whether and how PI3P might contribute to the Cb-mediated anchoring of gephyrin scaffolds beneath the postsynaptic membrane and whether the affinity and specificity of the Cb/PI3P interaction as determined in vitro correlate with a defined role of PI3P in the formation of inhibitory postsynapses. In this study, we investigated the role of PI3P at developing GABAergic postsynapses in cultured hippocampal neurons by using a membrane-permeant PI3P derivative (21Subramanian D. Laketa V. Müller R. Tischer C. Zarbakhsh S. Pepperkok R. Schultz C. Activation of membrane-permeant caged PtdIns(3)P induces endosomal fusion in cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), time-lapse confocal imaging, electrophysiology, as well as knockdown and overexpression of PI3P-metabolizing enzymes. Our results indicate that a PI3P pool associated with early/sorting endosomes is important for the formation of Cb-dependent inhibitory postsynapses. We thereby provide the first demonstration that PI3P is a critical regulator of postsynaptic gephyrin and GABAAR clustering and that it is involved in the regulation of inhibitory postsynaptic strength in neurons. To assess the specific role of PI3P in the Cb-dependent clustering of gephyrin at inhibitory postsynapses, we focused on hippocampal neurons in culture, which receive glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic inputs and show defects in GABAergic postsynaptic composition and function upon Cb deletion (22Papadopoulos T. Korte M. Eulenburg V. Kubota H. Retiounskaia M. Harvey R.J. Harvey K. O'Sullivan G.A. Laube B. Hülsmann S. Geiger J.R. Betz H. Impaired GABAergic transmission and altered hippocampal synaptic plasticity in collybistin-deficient mice.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3888-3899Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We first aimed to experimentally increase the intracellular PI3P concentration in cultured neurons by applying a membrane-permeable PI3P-acetoxymethyl (AM) ester derivative, its photoactivatable “caged” coumarin-PI3P-AM variant, and, as a negative control, its regioisomer PI4P-AM, all of which had previously been validated in HeLa cells (21Subramanian D. Laketa V. Müller R. Tischer C. Zarbakhsh S. Pepperkok R. Schultz C. Activation of membrane-permeant caged PtdIns(3)P induces endosomal fusion in cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and were recently used for studying vesicular trafficking in muscle cells of X-linked centronuclear myopathy patients (23Ketel K. Krauss M. Nicot A.S. Puchkov D. Wieffer M. Müller R. Subramanian D. Schultz C. Laporte J. Haucke V. A phosphoinositide conversion mechanism for exit from endosomes.Nature. 2016; 529: 408-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicate a distribution of both coumarin-caged and -uncaged PIP-AM probes into most cellular membranes (21Subramanian D. Laketa V. Müller R. Tischer C. Zarbakhsh S. Pepperkok R. Schultz C. Activation of membrane-permeant caged PtdIns(3)P induces endosomal fusion in cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Mentel M. Laketa V.

Engl. 2011; 50: 3811-3814Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, despite their wide subcellular distribution, these probes demonstrated high structural specificity, presumably through their specific interaction with endogenous PIP-binding proteins. For example, it has been shown that PI3P-AM induces early endosome fusion in living cells and that the resulting fused endosomes were positive for the endogenous early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1) (21Subramanian D. Laketa V. Müller R. Tischer C. Zarbakhsh S. Pepperkok R. Schultz C. Activation of membrane-permeant caged PtdIns(3)P induces endosomal fusion in cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a known marker of early endosomes that interacts specifically with PI3P via its FYVE finger domain (25Stenmark H. Aasland R. Toh B.H. D'Arrigo A. Endosomal localization of the autoantigen EEA1 is mediated by a zinc-binding FYVE finger.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24048-24054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In contrast, compounds of identical chemical composition as PI3P-AM but structurally slightly different, such as PI4P-AM and the enantiomer of PI3P-AM, were unable to induce early endosome fusion (21Subramanian D. Laketa V. Müller R. Tischer C. Zarbakhsh S. Pepperkok R. Schultz C. Activation of membrane-permeant caged PtdIns(3)P induces endosomal fusion in cells.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2010; 6: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In cultured hippocampal neurons, the AM-modified phosphoinositide variants were efficiently accumulated, as demonstrated by adding 50 μm coumarin-PI3P-AM to the culture medium. Neurons incubated with coumarin-PI3P-AM for ∼10 min displayed diffuse coumarin fluorescence (Fig. 1A), indicating efficient uptake and widespread distribution of the PI3P derivative into intracellular membranes. For quantitative experiments, we transfected cultured hippocampal neurons at DIV 9 with GFP-gephyrin, incubated the transfected neurons 1 day later for 2 h with 50 μm PI3P-AM (or PI4P-AM) or with the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) only, and analyzed the resulting effects on GFP-gephyrin distribution (Fig. 1, B and C). This protocol allowed us to visualize newly synthesized intracellular gephyrin that is en route to the plasma membrane at early stages of inhibitory postsynapse formation (from DIV 9 to DIV 10). Under these conditions, only few dendritic GFP-gephyrin clusters were formed in the transfected neurons prior to treatment, and most GFP-gephyrin was diffusely distributed in the cells and accumulated in larger somatic structures (Fig. 1B, left). The subsequent addition of PI3P-AM for 2 h (Fig. 1, B, left and C), but not of PI4P-AM or DMSO only (Fig. 1C), led to an increase in the number of dendritic GFP-gephyrin clusters, to a concomitant reduction of the diffuse cytoplasmic GFP-gephyrin fluorescence, and to an apparent redistribution of GFP-gephyrin from the large cytoplasmic structures to numerous smaller clusters (Fig. 1B, left). Three-dimensional reconstruction of confocal image stacks and examination of internal structures in the somata of transfected neurons disclosed an enhanced accumulation of GFP-gephyrin fluorescence within both somatic (Fig. 1B, YZ plane views) and perisomatic clusters. Quantification of the total numbers of GFP-gephyrin clusters in identified neurons before and after the 2-h treatment indicated an increase by 76.6% in the neurons treated with PI3P-AM but not in those treated with DMSO or PI4P-AM (Fig. 1C; DMSO, 111.8 ± 7.2%, n = 10; PI3P-AM, 176.6 ± 15.6%, n = 10; PI4P-AM, 97.9 ± 1.6%, n = 10). Qualitatively similar effects were also observed with the coumarin-PI3P-AM derivative upon UV-light photoactivation and a 1-h incubation (Fig. 1A). To test for PI3P effects on GFP-gephyrin recruitment to developing dendritic and perisomatic inhibitory postsynapses, we performed confocal live-imaging of GFP-gephyrin-transfected neurons prior to compound treatment (Fig. 2, A–C, left), live-imaging of the same neurons upon a 2-h treatment with DMSO, PI3P-AM, or PI4P-AM, respectively (Fig. 2, A–C, center), and confocal imaging of these neurons after fixation and post hoc staining for the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter (VIAAT), a marker of GABAergic presynapses (Fig. 2, A–C, right). This revealed an ∼1.5-fold increase in the average fluorescence intensity of postsynaptic GFP-gephyrin clusters apposed to presynaptic VIAAT puncta in PI3P-AM-treated neurons but not in cells treated with DMSO only or PI4P-AM (Fig. 2D; DMSO, 95.9 ± 3.8%, n = 70 postsynaptic clusters; PI3P-AM, 150.4 ± 17.9%, n = 70 postsynaptic clusters; PI4P-AM, 98.9 ± 5.1%, n = 35 postsynaptic clusters). We therefore conclude that membrane-permeant PI3P promotes gephyrin clustering at inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Notably, a considerable fraction of the GFP-gephyrin clusters seen after PI3P-AM treatment were not apposed to VIAAT but appeared intracellularly localized (Fig. 2B, right). Their rounded structures suggest that these clusters represented vesicle-associated GFP-gephyrin assemblies rather than amorphous intracellular aggregates, as seen upon overexpression in heterologous cells (26Meyer G.

The postsynaptic localization of the glycine receptor-associated protein gephyrin is regulated by the cytoskeleton.J.

Partial glycinergic denervation induces transient changes in the distribution of a glycine receptor-associated protein in a central neuron.J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 116-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated a strong interdependence between gephyrin and major GABAAR subunits in postsynaptic clustering (29Essrich C. Lorez M. Benson J.A. Fritschy J.M. Lüscher B. Postsynaptic clustering of major GABAA receptor subtypes requires the γ2 subunit and gephyrin.Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 30Kneussel M.

To determine the physiological consequences of the enhanced postsynaptic GFP-gephyrin clustering found after PI3P-AM treatment, we recorded GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in autaptic cultures of DIV 9–10 GABAergic neurons from striata. In these cultures, in which isolated single neurons form synapses with themselves, pre- and postsynaptic effects of PI3P-AM on GABAergic neurotransmission can be distinguished with relative ease (31Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Excitatory and inhibitory autaptic currents in isolated hippocampal neurons maintained in cell culture.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Mean mIPSC amplitudes were significantly (by 83.4%) increased in PI3P-AM-treated neurons (61.6 ± 4.7 pA, n = 30) as compared with cells treated with DMSO only (33.6 ± 2.3 pA, n = 26; Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, mIPSC frequencies were not significantly different between the two groups (PI3P-AM, 1.3 ± 0.2 Hz, n = 30; DMSO, 1.2 ± 0.4 Hz, n = 26; Fig. 3B). The larger mIPSC amplitudes and the unchanged mIPSC frequencies in PI3P-AM-treated neurons indicate an increased number of functional postsynaptic GABAARs, which is in line with the increase in postsynaptic GFP-gephyrin clustering observed upon PI3P-AM treatment (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, exogenous application of GABA, which activates both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAARs, led to a significant increase of the mean current amplitude (by 82.4%) in PI3P-AM-treated neurons (1.82 ± 0.24 nA; n = 33) as compared and normalized to cells treated with DMSO only (1.00 ± 0.1 nA; n = 24; Fig. 3C). As PI3P is present in endosomes at presynaptic terminals (32Wucherpfennig T. Wilsch-Bräuninger M. González-Gaitán M. Role of Drosophila Rab5 during endosomal trafficking at the synapse and evoked neurotransmitter release.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 609-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we tested whether evoked neurotransmitter release is affected in PI3P-AM-treated striatal autaptic neurons. Although mean mIPSC amplitudes were strongly increased (Fig. 3, A and B), mean eIPSC amplitudes were reduced (by 53%) in PI3P-AM-treated as compared with DMSO-treated cells (PI3P-AM, 1.8 ± 0.33 nA, n = 30; DMSO, 3.82 ± 0.5 nA, n = 26; Fig. 3D, left and center). Accordingly, the number of SVs released per action potential (AP) (eIPSC charge/mIPSC charge, see under “Experimental Procedures”) was strongly reduced after PI3P-AM treatment (PI3P-AM, 42.7 ± 9.6, n = 21; DMSO, 242.1 ± 58.58, n = 18; Fig. 3D, right). In contrast, postsynaptic responses triggered by hypertonic sucrose solution, which causes the release of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of SVs (33Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 34Jockusch W.J. Speidel D. Sigler A. Sørensen J.B. Varoqueaux F. Rhee J.S. Brose N. CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 are essential synaptic vesicle priming proteins.Cell. 2007; 131: 796-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), were similar between both groups (PI3P-AM, 1.62 ± 0.27 nC, n = 30; DMSO, 1.09 ± 0.17 nC, n = 26; Fig. 3, E, left and center). Likewise, the numbers of primed synaptic vesicles (PSVs; RRP charge/mIPSC charge) were not significantly different between PI3P-AM- and DMSO-treated neurons (PI3P-AM, 1245 ± 216, n = 21; DMSO, 969 ± 207, n = 18; Fig. 3E, right). Based on these results, the SV release probability (Pvr) in the PI3P-AM-treated neurons, calculated either by dividing the charge transfer during AP-evoked IPSCs by the RRP charge (Fig. 3F, left) or by dividing the number of SVs released per AP by the number of PSVs (Fig. 3F, right), was strongly reduced in the presence of PI3P-AM-treated as compared with DMSO-treated neurons. Together, our electrophysiological analyses of autaptic GABAergic neurons indicate that mIPSCs and eIPSCs are regulated differentially upon an increase of PI3P in endomembranes, likely due to an increased GABAAR density at the postsynapse and an impairment of SV recycling at the presynaptic terminal. To study the effects of PI3P-AM during the early stages of inhibitory synapse formation, we immunostained the autaptic striatal neurons for VIAAT as a marker of GABAergic presynapses, and for gephyrin and the α2 subunit of GABAARs, which are co-enriched in GABAergic postsynapses (35Nair R. Lauks J. Jung S. Cooke N.E. de Wit H. Brose N. Kilimann M.W. Verhage M. Rhee J. Neurobeachin regulates neurotransmitter receptor trafficking to synapses.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 200: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). After treating the striatal autaptic cultures at DIV 9 for 2 h with DMSO only (Fig. 4A, left) or 50 μm PI3P-AM (Fig. 4A, right), immunocytochemistry was performed as indicated. At this developmental stage, gephyrin and GABAAR-α2 immunoreactive clusters were distributed at both extrasynaptic and postsynaptic sites, as indicated by their only partial apposition to VIAAT-positive puncta (Fig. 4B). PI3P-AM treatment did not significantly change the total number of dendritic VIAAT, gephyrin, or GABAAR-α2 clusters, as compared with DMSO-only treated neurons (Fig. 4C, left; VIAAT: DMSO, 13.25 ± 1.01 puncta/40 μm, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 10.9 ± 0.63 puncta/40 μm, n = 20; gephyrin: DMSO, 14.3 ± 1.88 clusters/40 μm, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 13.35 ± 1.07 clusters/40 μm, n = 20; GABAAR-α2: DMSO, 9.7 ± 1.06 clusters/40 μm, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 8.8 ± 0.79 clusters/40 μm, n = 20). However, the percentages of synaptic gephyrin and GABAAR-α2 clusters colocalizing with VIAAT immunoreactivity were significantly increased upon PI3P-AM treatment, as compared with DMSO-only treated cells (Fig. 4C, center; synaptic gephyrin: DMSO, 70.71 ± 3.48%, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 83.47 ± 2.37%, n = 20; synaptic GABAAR-α2: DMSO, 61.15 ± 3.16%, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 82.52 ± 2.78%, n = 20). Furthermore, the mean sizes of these synaptic gephyrin and GABAAR-α2 clusters were significantly larger in PI3P-AM-treated neurons, as compared with cells treated with DMSO only (Fig. 4C, right; gephyrin: DMSO, 0.18 μm2 ± 0.014 μm2, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 0.26 μm2 ± 0.021 μm2, n = 20; GABAAR-α2: DMSO, 0.17 μm2 ± 0.01 μm2, n = 20; PI3P-AM, 0.22 μm2 ± 0.016 μm2, n = 20).

https://openalex.org/W2562775148,"Cognitive tasks require storing and manipulating information for short periods of time. Verbal working memory involves storing and manipulating speech information, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain unknown. The authors identify storage systems for sensory and motor representations and two distinct manipulation systems, demonstrating that multiple subsystems comprise verbal working memory. Verbal working memory (vWM) involves storing and manipulating information in phonological sensory input. An influential theory of vWM proposes that manipulation is carried out by a central executive while storage is performed by two interacting systems: a phonological input buffer that captures sound-based information and an articulatory rehearsal system that controls speech motor output. Whether, when and how neural activity in the brain encodes these components remains unknown. Here we read out the contents of vWM from neural activity in human subjects as they manipulated stored speech sounds. As predicted, we identified storage systems that contained both phonological sensory and articulatory motor representations. Unexpectedly, however, we found that manipulation did not involve a single central executive but rather involved two systems with distinct contributions to successful manipulation. We propose, therefore, that multiple subsystems comprise the central executive needed to manipulate stored phonological input for articulatory motor output in vWM."

For these studies, we generated mice with Rac1 deletion under the control of the GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) promoter (GFAP-Cre;Rac1flox/flox). GFAP-Cre;Rac1flox/flox (Rac1-KO) mice exhibited better recovery after spinal cord injury and exhibited reduced astrogliosis at the lesion site relative to control. Reduced astrogliosis was also observed in Rac1-KO mice following microbeam irradiation-induced injury. Moreover, knockdown (KD) or KO of Rac1 in astrocytes (LN229 cells, primary astrocytes, or primary astrocytes from Rac1-KO mice) led to delayed cell cycle progression and reduced cell migration. Rac1-KD or Rac1-KO astrocytes additionally had decreased levels of GSPT1 (G1 to S phase transition 1) expression and reduced responses of IL-1β and GSPT1 to LPS treatment, indicating that IL-1β and GSPT1 are downstream molecules of Rac1 associated with inflammatory condition. Furthermore, GSPT1-KD astrocytes had cell cycle delay, with no effect on cell migration. The cell cycle delay induced by Rac1-KD was rescued by overexpression of GSPT1. Based on these results, we propose that Rac1-GSPT1 represents a novel signaling axis in astrocytes that accelerates proliferation in response to inflammation, which is one important factor in the development of astrogliosis/glial scar following CNS injury.

https://openalex.org/W2560834913,"Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, plays an important role in mitochondrial processes and bioenergetics. CL is synthesized de novo and undergoes remodeling in the mitochondrial membranes. Perturbation of CL remodeling leads to the rare X-linked genetic disorder Barth syndrome, which shows disparities in clinical presentation. To uncover biochemical modifiers that exacerbate CL deficiency, we carried out a synthetic genetic array screen to identify synthetic lethal interactions with the yeast CL synthase mutant crd1Δ. The results indicated that crd1Δ is synthetically lethal with mutants in pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA levels were decreased in the mutant. The synthesis of acetyl-CoA depends primarily on the PDH-catalyzed conversion of pyruvate in the mitochondria and on the PDH bypass in the cytosol, which synthesizes acetyl-CoA from acetate. Consistent with perturbation of the PDH bypass, crd1Δ cells grown on acetate as the sole carbon source exhibited decreased growth, decreased acetyl-CoA, and increased intracellular acetate levels resulting from decreased acetyl-CoA synthetase activity. PDH mRNA and protein levels were up-regulated in crd1Δ cells, but PDH enzyme activity was not increased, indicating that PDH up-regulation did not compensate for defects in the PDH bypass. These findings demonstrate for the first time that CL is required for acetyl-CoA synthesis, which is decreased in CL-deficient cells as a result of a defective PDH bypass pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2561470245,"CIB1 (calcium and integrin binding protein 1) is a small intracellular protein with numerous interacting partners, and hence has been implicated in various cellular functions. Recent studies have revealed emerging roles of CIB1 in regulating cancer cell survival and angiogenesis, although the mechanisms involved have remained largely undefined. In investigating the oncogenic function of CIB1, we initially found that CIB1 is widely up-regulated across a diverse range of cancers, with this upregulation frequently correlating with oncogenic mutations of KRas. Consistent with this, we found that ectopic expression of oncogenic KRas and HRas in cells resulted in elevated CIB1 expression. We previously described the Ca2+-myristoyl switch function of CIB1, and its ability to facilitate agonist-induced plasma membrane localisation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a location where SK1 is known to elicit oncogenic signalling. Thus, we examined the role this may play in oncogenesis. Consistent with these findings, we demonstrated here that over-expression of CIB1 by itself is sufficient to drive localisation of SK1 to the plasma membrane and enhance the membrane-associated enzymatic activity of SK1, as well as its oncogenic signalling. We subsequently demonstrated that elevated levels of CIB1 resulted in full neoplastic transformation, in a manner dependent on SK1. In agreement with our previous findings that SK1 is a downstream mediator of oncogenic signalling by Ras, we found that targeting CIB1 also inhibited neoplastic growth of cells induced by oncogenic Ras, suggesting an important pro-tumorigenic role for CIB1. Thus, we have demonstrated for the first time a role for CIB1 in neoplastic transformation, and revealed a novel mechanism facilitating oncogenic signalling by Ras and SK1."
https://openalex.org/W2563105066,"The gene encoding ‘deleted in breast cancer 2’ (DBC2), also referred to as RHOBTB2 (Rho-related BTB domain-containing protein 2), is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. DBC2 is a substrate-specific adaptor protein for a novel class of Cullin-3 (CUL3)-based E3 ubiquitin ligases; however, it is unclear if the substrate adaptor function of DBC2 is required for its tumor suppressor activity. Furthermore, the key substrates of DBC2-mediated ubiquitination have yet to be identified. In the present study, we established a genome-wide human cDNA library-based in vitro ubiquitination target screening assay and identified Musashi-2 (MSI2) as a novel ubiquitination target protein of DBC2. MSI2 directly interacted with DBC2, and this interaction promoted MSI2 polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in breast cancer cells. Overexpression and knockdown experiments demonstrated that DBC2 suppressed MSI2-associated oncogenic functions and induced apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis of a breast cancer tissue microarray revealed that DBC2 and MSI2 protein levels are inversely correlated in both normal breast tissues and breast cancer tissues. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that DBC2 suppresses tumorigenesis in breast cancer by ubiquitinating MSI2."
https://openalex.org/W2560789263,"Timely initiation of replication in Escherichia coli requires functional regulation of the replication initiator, ATP-DnaA. The cellular level of ATP-DnaA increases just before initiation, after which its level decreases through hydrolysis of DnaA-bound ATP, yielding initiation-inactive ADP-DnaA. Previously, we reported a novel DnaA-ATP hydrolysis system involving the chromosomal locus datA and named it datA-dependent DnaA-ATP hydrolysis (DDAH). The datA locus contains a binding site for a nucleoid-associating factor integration host factor (IHF) and a cluster of three known DnaA-binding sites, which are important for DDAH. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of the datA-IHF·DnaA complex remain unclear. We now demonstrate that a novel DnaA box within datA is essential for ATP-DnaA complex formation and DnaA-ATP hydrolysis. Specific DnaA residues, which are important for interaction with bound ATP and for head-to-tail inter-DnaA interaction, were also required for ATP-DnaA-specific oligomer formation on datA. Furthermore, we show that negative DNA supercoiling of datA stabilizes ATP-DnaA oligomers, and stimulates datA-IHF interaction and DnaA-ATP hydrolysis. Relaxation of DNA supercoiling by the addition of novobiocin, a DNA gyrase inhibitor, inhibits datA function in cells. On the basis of these results, we propose a mechanistic model of datA-IHF·DnaA complex formation and DNA supercoiling-dependent regulation for DDAH.

https://openalex.org/W2564762707,"A well-studied RNA-binding protein Hu Antigen-R (HuR), controls post-transcriptional gene regulation and undergoes stress-activated caspase-3 dependent cleavage in cancer cells. The cleavage products of HuR are known to promote cell death; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms facilitating caspase-3 activation and HuR cleavage remains unknown. Here, we show that HuR cleavage associated with active caspase-3 in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drug, paclitaxel. We determined that oral cancer cells overexpressing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) limited the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR, which reduced the rate of cell death in paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells. Specific inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib, promoted apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of HuR in paclitaxel-resistant oral cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, oral cancer cells overexpressing cellular HuR increased the half-life of COX-2 mRNA, promoted COX-2 protein expression and exhibited enhanced tumor growth in vivo in comparison with cells expressing a cleavable form of HuR. Finally, our ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation and sequencing (RIP-seq) analyses of HuR in oral cancer cells treated with ionizing radiation (IR), determined that HuR cleavage product-1 (HuR-CP1) bound and promoted the expression of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in apoptosis. Our results indicated that, cellular non-cleavable HuR controls COX-2 mRNA expression and enzymatic activity. In addition, overexpressed COX-2 protein repressed the cleavage of caspase-3 and HuR to promote drug resistance and tumor growth. Altogether, our observations support the use of the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, in combination with paclitaxel, for the management of paclitaxel resistant oral cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2563884854,"Epithelial ovarian carcinoma is the most common cause of death from gynecologic cancers largely due to advanced, relapsed and chemotherapy-resistant peritoneal metastasis, which is refractory to the currently used treatment approaches. Mechanisms supporting advanced and relapsed peritoneal metastasis are largely unknown, precluding development of more effective targeted therapies. In this study, we investigated the function of a potentially targetable fractalkine axis in the formation and the development of advanced and relapsed peritoneal metastasis and its impact on patients' outcomes. Our mouse model studies support a role for the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) in the initiation of peritoneal adhesion important for recolonization of relapsed peritoneal metastasis. We show that downregulation of CX3CR1 results in reduction of metastatic burden at several peritoneal sites commonly colonized by advanced and relapsed metastatic ovarian carcinoma. We show that the chemokine fractalkine (CX3CL1), an activating ligand of CX3CR1, regulates organ-specific peritoneal colonization. High expression of CX3CR1 correlates with significantly shorter survival, specifically in post-menopausal patients with advanced and terminal stages of the disease. Taken together, our studies support a key regulatory role for the fractalkine axis in advanced and relapsed peritoneal metastasis in epithelial ovarian carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2560409316,"Many members of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) family are activated by glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Visceral adipose tissue-derived serpin (vaspin), serpin A12 of the serpin family, and its target protease kallikrein 7 (KLK7) are heparin-binding proteins, and inhibition of KLK7 by vaspin is accelerated by heparin. However, the nature of GAG binding to vaspin is not known. Here, we measured vaspin binding of various glycosaminoglycans and low molecular weight heparins by microscale thermophoresis and analyzed acceleration of protease inhibition by these molecules. In addition, basic residues contributing to heparin binding and heparin activation were identified by a selective labeling approach. Together, these data show that vaspin binds heparin with high affinity (KD = 21 ± 2 nm) and that binding takes place at a basic patch on top of β-sheet A and is different from other heparin-binding serpins. Mutation of basic residues decreased heparin binding and activation of vaspin. Similarly, reactive center loop insertion into sheet A decreased heparin binding because it disturbs the basic cluster. Finally, using vaspin-overexpressing keratinocyte cells, we show that a significant part of secreted vaspin is bound in the extracellular matrix on the cell surface. Together, basic residues of central β-sheet A contribute to heparin binding and activation of vaspin. Thus, binding to GAGs in the extracellular matrix can direct and regulate vaspin interaction with target proteases or other proteins and may play an important role in the various beneficial functions of vaspin in different tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2566508441,"Mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes result in microsatellite instability (MSI) and early onset of colorectal cancer. To get mechanistic insights into the time scale, sequence and frequency of intestinal stem cell (ISC) transformation, we quantified MSI and growth characteristics of organoids of Msh2-deficient and control mice from birth until tumor formation and related them to tissue gene expression. Although in Msh2-deficient organoids MSI continuously increased from birth, growth characteristics remained stable at first. Months before tumor onset, normal Msh2-deficient tissue contained tumor precursor cells forming organoids with higher MSI, cystic growth and growth rates resembling temporarily those of tumor organoids. Consistently, Msh2-deficient tissue exhibited a tumor-like gene signature. Normal Msh2-deficient organoids showed increased inheritable transient cyst-like growth, which became independent of R-spondin. ISC transformation proceeded faster in vitro than in vivo independent of the underlying genotype but more under MMR deficiency. Transient cyst-like growth but not MSI was suppressed by aspirin. In summary, as highlighted by organoids, molecular alterations continuously proceeded long before tumor onset in MMR-deficient intestine, thus increasing its susceptibility for ISC transformation."

Our previous studies demonstrated the importance of PLCγ2 in osteoclast (OC) differentiation by modulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-mediated calcium oscillations and the up-regulation of the transcription factor NFATc1. Surprisingly, despite being expressed throughout osteoclastogenesis, PLCγ1 did not compensate for PLCγ2 deficiency. Because both isoforms are activated during osteoclastogenesis, it is plausible that PLCγ1 modulates OC development independently of PLCγ2. Here, we utilized PLCγ1-specific shRNAs to delete PLCγ1 in OC precursors derived from wild type (WT) mice. Differently from PLCγ2, we found that PLCγ1 shRNA significantly suppresses OC differentiation by limiting colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1)-dependent proliferation and β-catenin/cyclinD1 levels. Confirming the specificity toward CSF-1 signaling, PLCγ1 is recruited to the CSF-1 receptor following exposure to the cytokine. To understand how PLCγ1 controls cell proliferation, we turned to its downstream effector, DAG. By utilizing cells lacking the DAG kinase ζ, which have increased DAG levels, we demonstrate that DAG modulates CSF-1-dependent proliferation and β-catenin/cyclinD1 levels in OC precursors. Most importantly, the proliferation and osteoclastogenesis defects observed in the absence of PLCγ1 are normalized in PLCγ1/DAG kinase ζ double null cells.
