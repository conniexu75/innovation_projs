https://openalex.org/W1965499304,"Most mathematical models for the spread of disease use differential equations based on uniform mixing assumptions1 or ad hoc models for the contact process2,3,4. Here we explore the use of dynamic bipartite graphs to model the physical contact patterns that result from movements of individuals between specific locations. The graphs are generated by large-scale individual-based urban traffic simulations built on actual census, land-use and population-mobility data. We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like5 graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free6, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population."

https://openalex.org/W2085901707,"The citric acid cycle is central to the regulation of energy homeostasis and cell metabolism1. Mutations in enzymes that catalyse steps in the citric acid cycle result in human diseases with various clinical presentations2. The intermediates of the citric acid cycle are present at micromolar concentration in blood and are regulated by respiration, metabolism and renal reabsorption/extrusion. Here we show that GPR91 (ref. 3), a previously orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), functions as a receptor for the citric acid cycle intermediate succinate. We also report that GPR99 (ref. 4), a close relative of GPR91, responds to α-ketoglutarate, another intermediate in the citric acid cycle. Thus by acting as ligands for GPCRs, succinate and α-ketoglutarate are found to have unexpected signalling functions beyond their traditional roles. Furthermore, we show that succinate increases blood pressure in animals. The succinate-induced hypertensive effect involves the renin–angiotensin system and is abolished in GPR91-deficient mice. Our results indicate a possible role for GPR91 in renovascular hypertension, a disease closely linked to atherosclerosis, diabetes and renal failure5,6."

This state is analogous to a ``photon-number path entangled state'' and can be used for super-resolving interferometry. Measuring a birefringent phase shift, we demonstrate two- and three-fold improvements in phase resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2041482906,"Even though the genetic fingerprint of human sperm has been defined, its role in orchestrating fertilization and the development of the early embryo remains vague. Here we show that human male gametes pass over more to the oocyte than just the haploid male genome--paternal messenger RNAs are also delivered to the egg at fertilization. If these transcripts, previously thought to be left-overs from spermatogenesis, are important in early development, our findings may have implications for the success of somatic-cell nuclear transfer in cloning technology and the identification of components leading to unexplained male-factor infertility."

https://openalex.org/W2092899947,"Superposition is one of the most distinctive features of quantum theory and has been demonstrated in numerous single-particle interference experiments1,2,3,4. Quantum entanglement5, the coherent superposition of states in multi-particle systems, yields more complex phenomena6,7. One important type of multi-particle experiment uses path-entangled number states, which exhibit pure higher-order interference and the potential for applications in metrology and imaging8; these include quantum interferometry and spectroscopy with phase sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit9,10,11,12, or quantum lithography beyond the classical diffraction limit13. It has been generally understood14 that in optical implementations of such schemes, lower-order interference effects always decrease the overall performance at higher particle numbers. Such experiments have therefore been limited to two photons15,16,17,18. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating a four-photon interferometer based on linear optics. We observe interference fringes with a periodicity of one-quarter of the single-photon wavelength, confirming the presence of a four-particle mode-entangled state. We anticipate that this scheme should be extendable to arbitrary photon numbers, holding promise for realizable applications with entanglement-enhanced performance."
https://openalex.org/W2159998111,"Voltage-gated calcium channels (CaVs) govern muscle contraction, hormone and neurotransmitter release, neuronal migration, activation of calcium-dependent signalling cascades, and synaptic input integration1. An essential CaV intracellular protein, the β-subunit (CaVβ)1,2, binds a conserved domain (the α-interaction domain, AID) between transmembrane domains I and II of the pore-forming α1 subunit3 and profoundly affects multiple channel properties such as voltage-dependent activation2, inactivation rates2, G-protein modulation4, drug sensitivity5 and cell surface expression6,7. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structures of the CaVβ2a conserved core, alone and in complex with the AID. Previous work suggested that a conserved region, the β-interaction domain (BID), formed the AID-binding site3,8; however, this region is largely buried in the CaVβ core and is unavailable for protein–protein interactions. The structure of the AID–CaVβ2a complex shows instead that CaVβ2a engages the AID through an extensive, conserved hydrophobic cleft (named the α-binding pocket, ABP). The ABP–AID interaction positions one end of the CaVβ near the intracellular end of a pore-lining segment, called IS6, that has a critical role in CaV inactivation9,10. Together, these data suggest that CaVβs influence CaV gating by direct modulation of IS6 movement within the channel pore."

https://openalex.org/W2076405456,"The Nrf2 transcription factor is more rapidly turned over in cells grown under homeostatic conditions than in those experiencing oxidative stress. The variable turnover of Nrf2 is accomplished through the use of at least two degrons and its redox-sensitive interaction with the Kelch-repeat protein Keap1. In homeostatic COS1 cells, the Neh2 degron confers on Nrf2 a half-life of less than 10 min. Analyses of deletion mutants of a Gal4(HA)mNeh2 fusion protein and full-length mNrf2 indicate that full redox-sensitive Neh2 destabilizing activity depends upon two separate sequences within this N-terminal domain. The DIDLID element (amino acids 17–32) is indispensable for Neh2 activity and appears necessary to recruit a ubiquitin ligase to the fusion protein. A second motif within Neh2, the ETGE tetrapeptide (amino acids 79–82), allows the redox-sensitive recruitment of Nrf2 to Keap1. This interaction, which occurs only in homeostatic cells, enhances the capacity of the Neh2 degron to direct degradation by functioning downstream of ubiquitination mediated by the DIDLID element. By contrast with the situation under homeostatic conditions, the Neh2 degron is neither necessary nor sufficient to account for the characteristic half-life of Nrf2 in oxidatively stressed cells. Instead, the previously uncharacterized, redox-insensitive Neh6 degron (amino acids 329–379) is essential to ensure that the transcription factor is still appropriately turned over in stressed cells, albeit with an increased half-life of 40 min. A model can now be proposed to explain how the turnover of this protein adapts in response to alterations in cellular redox state."
https://openalex.org/W2147330842,"We examined the in vivo role of membrane-bound prostaglandin E synthase (mPGES)-1, a terminal enzyme in the PGE2-biosynthetic pathway, using mPGES-1 knockout (KO) mice. Comparison of PGES activity in the membrane fraction of tissues from mPGES-1 KO and wild-type (WT) mice indicated that mPGES-1 accounted for the majority of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-inducible PGES in WT mice. LPS-stimulated production of PGE2, but not other PGs, was impaired markedly in mPGES-1-null macrophages, although a low level of cyclooxygenase-2-dependent PGE2 production still remained. Pain nociception, as assessed by the acetic acid writhing response, was reduced significantly in KO mice relative to WT mice. This phenotype was particularly evident when these mice were primed with LPS, where the stretching behavior and the peritoneal PGE2 level of KO mice were far less than those of WT mice. Formation of inflammatory granulation tissue and attendant angiogenesis in the dorsum induced by subcutaneous implantation of a cotton thread were reduced significantly in KO mice compared with WT mice. Moreover, collagen antibody-induced arthritis, a model for human rheumatoid arthritis, was milder in KO mice than in WT mice. Collectively, our present results provide unequivocal evidence that mPGES-1 contributes to the formation of PGE2 involved in pain hypersensitivity and inflammation.

E2 is the most common prostanoid, being produced by a variety of cells and tissues, and has a broad range of biological activity. Recent advances in this research field have led to molecular identification and characterization of various enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of PGE2, including phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cyclooxygenase (COX) and terminal PGE synthase (PGES) (1Murakami M. Kudo I. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 3-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Each of these three enzymatic steps can be rate limiting for PGE2 biosynthesis and involves multiple enzymes/isozymes that can act in different phases of cell activation. The PGE2 produced thus far is then released from the cells and acts on the four types of PGE receptor, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, which are coupled with trimeric G protein signaling (2Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2000; 39: 289-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). PGES, which catalyzes the conversion of PGH2 to PGE2, exists as membrane-associated and cytosolic enzymes. Two of them are membrane-bound enzymes and have been designated as mPGES-1 and mPGES-2 (3Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Tanioka T. Kudo I.

Inducible expression of mPGES-1 is in part regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (13Han R. Tsui S. Smith T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16355-16364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), where the kinases may switch on the inducible transcription factor Egr-1 that in turn binds to the proximal GC box in the mPGES-1 promoter, leading to mPGES-1 transcription (14Naraba H.

Cytosolic PGES (cPGES), a GSH-requiring enzyme constitutively expressed in a wide variety of cells, is functionally linked to COX-1, not COX-2, to promote immediate PGE2 production (17Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Semmyo N. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32775-32782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). This enzyme is regulated by formation of a complex with Hsp90, a molecular chaperone (18Tanioka T. Nakatani Y. Kobayashi T. Tsujimoto M. Oh-ishi S. Murakami M. Kudo I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 1018-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, two cytosolic GSH-S-transferases (μ2 and μ3) have the ability to catalyze the isomerization of PGH2 to PGE2, at least in vitro (19Beuckmann C.T. Fujimori K. Urade Y. Hayaishi O. Neurochem. Res. 2000; 25: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The importance of PGE2 in various pathophysiological events dictates the necessity to understand the role of each PGES enzyme in vivo. In fact, biochemical and cell biological analyses have led to the proposal that among the PGES enzymes identified so far, mPGES-1 may be most critically responsible for the production of the PGE2 implicated in various pathophysiological events. An initial study with mPGES-1 knock-out (KO) mice has reported the essential role of mPGES-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated delayed PGE2 production by macrophages, although these mice are fertile, develop normally after birth, and retain LPS-stimulated production of various cytokines (20Uematsu S. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In this study, we used mPGES-1 KO mice to analyze the role of mPGES-1 in inflammation-associated pain hypersensitivity, tissue granulation accompanying angiogenesis, and arthritis induced by collagen antibody. Animals—Male C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Saitama Animal Center. The mPGES-1 KO mice and littermate wild-type (WT) mice (C57BL/6 × 129/SvJ background) were described previously (20Uematsu S. Matsumoto M. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Male mice (7 weeks old) were used in each experiment. Mice were housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility, and all experiments were performed under approved institutional guidance. Agents—LPS (Escherichia coli 0111:B4), goat anti-mouse vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), and indomethacin were purchased from Sigma. Mouse anti-human cPLA2α monoclonal antibody and goat anti-human COX-1 and COX-2 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit antibodies against human mPGES-1 (12Kamei D.

Enzyme immunoassay kits for PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1α (a stable end product of PGI2), PGF2α, and thromboxane B2 (a stable end product of thromboxane A2) and the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 were purchased from Cayman Chemicals. The COX-1 inhibitor valeryl salicylate was a generous gift from Dr. W. Smith (University of Michigan). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Bex. Measurement of PGES Activity—PGES activity was measured by assessment of conversion of PGH2 to PGE2 as reported previously (4Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell or tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1hat4 °C, and the membrane fractions were used as an enzyme source. An aliquot (10 μg of protein equivalents) was incubated with 0.5 μg of PGH2 for 30 s at 24 °C in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm glutathione and 5 μg of indomethacin. After stopping the reaction by the addition of 100 mm FeCl2, the PGE2 content of the reaction mixture was quantified by use of the enzyme immunoassay kit. Preparation and Activation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal cells were recovered from mice that had received thioglycollate medium (Difco) (1 ml/20 g of body weight) 4 days before (22Naraba H. Murakami M. Matsumoto H. Shimbara S. Ueno A. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2974-2982PubMed Google Scholar). The peritoneal cells were seeded into 6- or 12-well plates (Iwaki Glass) at a cell density of 106 cells/ml in 2 ml (for 6-well plates) or 1 ml (for 12-well plates) of RPMI medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After incubation for 2 h in a CO2 incubator, the supernatants and nonadherent cells were removed. More than 90% of adherent cells were macrophages. Then the cells were incubated with or without 10 μg/ml LPS in medium containing 2% serum for appropriate periods. The supernatants were taken for enzyme immunoassay for prostanoids, and the cells were subjected to Western blotting (see below). Experiments with mPGES-1 Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Two synthetic hairpin-forming oligonucleotides directed at mPGES-1, 5′-GATCCCGGCCTTTGCCAACCCCGAGTTCAAGAGACTCGGGGTTGGCAAAGGCCTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ (sense) and 3′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAGGCCTTTGCCAACCCCGAGTCTCTTGAACTCGGGGTTGGCAAAGGCCGG-5′ (antisense), both of which harbored BamHI and HindIII sites at their 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were annealed, cut with BamHI and XbaI, and then ligated into the BamHI/XbaI-digested pRNA-U6.1/Hygro vector (GenScript) using T4 ligase (Takara Biomedicals). After transformation into DH5α-competent cells (TOYOBO), the plasmid was extracted and purified using the Endofree Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen). Transfection of the plasmid into peritoneal macrophages was performed by lipofection, as described previously (4Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M.

Briefly, 5 μg of the plasmid was mixed with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in 100 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min and then added to macrophages in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM in 12-well plates. After incubation for 24 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of fresh culture medium and then incubated with or without 10 μg/ml LPS in medium containing 2% fetal calf serum for 16 h. Acetic Acid Writhing Reaction—The writhing reaction was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of 0.9% (v/v) acetic acid solution at a dose of 5 ml/kg, as described previously (23Matsumoto H.

Matsuoka T. Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Oh-ishi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In one group of animals, LPS (10 μg/0.1 ml of saline/mouse) was given intraperitoneally 18 h before the injection of acetic acid solution. A suspension of 1 mg/ml indomethacin in 1% (w/v) sodium carboxymethylcellulose solution was injected subcutaneouslys into mice (at final dose of 10 mg/kg indomethacin/mouse) 30 min before the injection of acetic acid solution. The number of writhing responses was counted every 5 min. For measurement of prostanoids, mice were sacrificed 15 min after acetic acid injection, and their peritoneal cavities were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Nissui) containing 10 μm indomethacin. The pooled peritoneal fluids were adjusted to pH 3.0 with 1 n HCl and passed through Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters), and the retained PGs were eluted from the cartridges with 8 ml of methanol, as described previously (23Matsumoto H. Naraba H. Ueno A. Fujiyoshi T. Murakami M. Kudo I. Oh-ishi S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 352: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Ueno A. Matsumoto H. Naraba H. Ikeda Y. Ushikubi F. Matsuoka T. Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ichikawa A. Oh-ishi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A trace amount of [3H]PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals) was added to the samples before passage through the cartridges to calibrate the recovery of PGs. The solvent of the samples was evaporated, and then PGs were dissolved in an aliquot of buffer and assayed with commercial enzyme immunoassay kits for each PG. Cotton Thread-induced Granulation Tissue Formation—Cotton threads (Araiwa Co.) were washed overnight with ethyl acetate and dried at room temperature before being cut into 1-cm lengths (3 mg weight), and sterilized by dry heat at 180 °C for 2 h. The cotton threads were implanted subcutaneously into the dorsum of anesthetized mice by using a 13-gauge implant needle (Natume), as described previously (25Ghosh A.K. Hirasawa N. Ohtsu H. Watanabe T. Ohuchi K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). After appropriate periods, the mice were anesthetized and killed, and the granulation tissues were dissected together with the cotton threads and weighed. As required for the experiments, indomethacin (5 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally every day. The isolated granulation tissues were washed, cut into small pieces with scissors, and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in a homogenizing buffer comprising 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 μm indomethacin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100. The obtained tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min, and 200-μl aliquots of the supernatants were centrifuged again at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, the hemoglobin concentrations in the supernatants were determined spec-trophotometrically by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm with a hemoglobin assay kit (Wako). PGs were extracted from the homogenates with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges and quantified by enzyme immunoassay, as described above. Western Blotting—Aliquots of samples (20-μg protein equivalents) were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% (for cPLA2α and COXs) or 12.5% (for PGESs) gels under reducing conditions. The separated proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) with a semidry blotter (MilliBlot-SDE system; Millipore). After blocking with 3% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS (pH 7.4)) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), the membranes were probed with the respective antibodies (1:5,000 dilution for cPLA2α, COX-2, and PGESs; 1:1,000 dilution for VEGF; 1:2,500 dilution for HDC, and 1:20,000 dilution for COX-1 in TBS-Tween) for 2 h, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (for cPLA2α), anti-rabbit (for PGESs and HDC), or anti-goat (for COXs and VEGF) IgG antibody (1:5,000 dilution in TBS-Tween) for 2 h, and were visualized with the ECL Western blot system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (4Murakami M. Naraba H. Tanioka T. Semmyo N. Nakatani Y. Kojima F. Ikeda T. Fueki M. Ueno A. Oh-Ishi S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32783-32792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of the granulation tissue sections were incubated with Target Retrieval Solution (DAKO) as required, incubated for 10 min with 3% (v/v) H2O2, washed three times with TBS for 5 min each, incubated for 30 min with 5% (v/v) skim milk, washed three times with TBS-Tween for 5 min each, and incubated for 2 h with anti-mPGES-1 antibody in TBS (1:100 dilution). After five washes, the sections were treated with the CSA system staining kit (DAKO) followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin and eosin, as described previously (12Kamei D. Murakami M. Nakatani Y. Ishikawa Y. Ishii T. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19396-19405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Arthritis Model—Arthritis was induced in mPGES-1 KO and WT mice by the modified method of Terato et al. (26Terato K. Hasty K.A. Reife R.A. Cremer M.A. Kang A.H. Stuart J.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2103-2108PubMed Google Scholar, 27Terato K. Harper D.S. Griffiths M.M. Hasty D.L. Ye X.J. Cremer M.A. Seyer J.M. Autoimmunity. 1995; 22: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 10 mg of anti-type II collagen monoclonal antibodies (Immuno-Biological Laboratory) on day 0. On days 2 and 7, 50 μg of LPS (100 μl of 500 μg/ml solution in saline) was injected intraperitoneally followed by an intermittent LPS injection every 3 days to the end of the experiments. As a control, 2.5 or 0.1 ml of saline was injected in place of the antibodies or LPS, respectively. The clinical severity of arthritis was graded on a 0-3 scale as follows: 0, normal; 1, swelling of ankle or wrist, or limited to digits; 2, swelling of the entire paw; 3, maximal swelling. Each limb was graded by a single blinded observer, allowing a maximum arthritis score of 12 for each animal. On day 28, the mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine solution and a radiograph was taken with a soft x-ray apparatus (CMB-2; SOFTEX). After perfusion of mice with 4% (w/v) buffered paraformaldehyde, fore and right hind limbs were removed, decalcified in 10% (w/v) EDTA, and embedded in paraffin, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin or toluidine blue. Bone resorption was evaluated by the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining of the carpometacarpal joints. TRAP-positive cells were stained at pH 5.0 in the presence of l(+)-tartaric acid using naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) in N,N-dimethylformamide as the substrate. The specimens were subjected to histomorphometric analyses using a semiautomated system (Osteoplan II; Carl Zeiss), and measurements were made at a magnification of ×400. Osteoclast number and eroded surface were measured at the carpometacarpal joints in the metacarpal bones. After perfusion fixation, left femora and tibiae were excised and bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry using a bone mineral analyzer (DCS-600; Aloka Co.). To evaluate bone destruction of the knee joint area, BMDs of four equal longitudinal divisions in femur and tibia were measured, and the BMD around the knee joint was expressed by the sum of those in the distal one-fourth of femur and in the proximal one-fourth of tibia (28Azuma Y. Oue Y. Kanatani H. Ohta T. Kiyoki M. Komoriya K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). On day 6, all four paws including wrist or ankle joints were collected and homogenized in a homogenizing buffer. Then, aliquots were taken for PGE2 enzyme immunoassay and Western blotting, as described above. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Data were analyzed by Student's t test. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E., with p = 0.05 as the limit of significance. mPGES-1 Is a Major Inducible PGES in Vivo—Fig. 1A illustrates PGES enzymatic activities in the membrane fraction of various tissues from mPGES-1 KO and WT mice with or without 24-h treatment with LPS. Basal PGES activities (i.e. without LPS administration) in the brain, heart, intestine, and ear were similar between WT and KO mice, whereas the activity in the kidney of WT mice was about 4-fold higher than that of KO mice (Fig. 1A). Treatment of WT mice with LPS resulted in 3-8-fold increases in PGES activity over the basal levels of the individual tissues. In tissues of mPGES-1 KO mice, LPS-stimulated increases in PGES activity over the basal levels were only modest, although <2-fold increases were consistently observed in all tissues examined (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting of the membrane fractions of individual tissues revealed that the expression of mPGES-1 was markedly induced in tissues of WT mice, whereas no mPGES-1 protein was detected in tissues of KO mice (Fig. 1B). Constitutive expression of mPGES-1 was seen only in the kidney of WT mice (Fig. 1B), in agreement with a recent immunohistochemical study demonstrating the expression of mPGES-1 in the epithelia of distal tubules and medullary collecting ducts in this organ (29Guan Y. Zhang Y. Schneider A. Riendeau D. Mancini J.A. Davis L. Komhoff M. Breyer R.M. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F1173-F1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the brain (Fig. 1B), heart, and ear (data not shown), LPS-induced COX-2 expression in KO mice was similar to that in WT mice. In the intestine and kidney, COX-2 expression in LPS-treated KO mice was significantly lower than that in replicate WT mice (Fig. 1B), suggesting that mPGES-1-derived PGE2 amplifies COX-2 induction in these tissues. Thus, mPGES-1 represents a major inducible membrane-associated PGES in various tissues of LPS-treated mice. However, the fact that substantial levels of PGES activity still exist in tissues of KO mice implies the presence of another membrane-bound PGES that is expressed rather constitutively. Evaluation of the Role of mPGES-1 in PGE2Production by LPS-stimulated Macrophages—Accumulating evidence suggests that delayed PGE2 production by LPS-stimulated macrophages depends on inducible COX-2 and mPGES-1 (4Murakami M.

https://openalex.org/W2085685524,"The processing of the nfκb2 gene product p100 to generate p52 is a regulated event, which is important for the instrumental function of NF-κB. We previously demonstrated that this tightly controlled event is regulated positively by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase, IκB kinase α (IKKα). However, the precise mechanisms by which NIK and IKKα induce p100 processing remain unclear. Here, we show that, besides activating IKKα, NIK also serves as a docking molecule recruiting IKKα to p100. This novel function of NIK requires two specific amino acid residues, serine 866 and serine 870, of p100 that are known to be essential for inducible processing of p100. We also show that, after being recruited into p100 complex, activated IKKα phosphorylates specific serines located in both N- and C-terminal regions of p100 (serines 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872). The phosphorylation of these specific serines is the prerequisite for ubiquitination and subsequent processing of p100 mediated by the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase and 26 S proteasome, respectively. These results highlight the critical but different roles of NIK and IKKα in regulating p100 processing and shed light on the mechanisms mediating the tight control of p100 processing. These data also provide the first evidence for explaining why overexpression of IKKα or its activation by many other stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor and mitogens fails to induce p100 processing.

The transcription factor NF-κB plays a central role in the regulation of diverse biological processes including immune response, development, cell growth, and survival (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar, 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4631) Google Scholar, 3Silverman N.

Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). Consistently, deregulated function of NF-κB contributes to the development of various cell malignancies (5Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev.

NF-κB represents a family of related DNA-binding proteins, which in mammals includes five members: RelA (p65); RelB; c-Rel; p50; and p52 (8Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The NF-κB proteins primarily form p50/Rel or p52/Rel heterodimers, although they also may function as various other homodimers and heterodimers (8Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The NF-κB dimers are sequestered normally in the cytoplasm by ankyrin repeat-containing inhibitors called IκB proteins (1Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5592) Google Scholar). The canonical pathway of NF-κB activation involves inducible IκB degradation, which can be stimulated by various cellular stimuli, such as T-cell mitogens, proinflammatory cytokines, and antigens. These stimuli trigger an IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ARD, ankyrin repeat domain; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; HA, hemagglutinin; IB, immunoblotting; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; IP, immunoprecipitation; KA, kinase-inactive; β-TrCP, β-transducin repeat-containing protein. complex, which consists of IκB kinase α (IKKα), IKKβ (two catalytic subunits), and IKKγ (regulatory subunit, also named NEMO), to phosphorylate specific serines within the IκB sequence. The phosphorylated IκB then is targeted for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, allowing the NF-κB dimers to move to the nucleus and transactivate target genes (4Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar, 7Sun S.-C. Xiao G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Unlike the Rel proteins, p50 and p52 are synthesized as large precursors such as NF-κB1 p105 and NF-κB2 p100, respectively (8Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar, 9Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These precursor proteins generate the mature p50 and p52 NF-κB subunits through proteasome-mediated processing, which involves selective degradation of their C-terminal portions (3Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 13Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the C-terminal regions of both p105 and p100 contain ankyrin repeats and function as IκB-like inhibitors of NF-κB (11Rice N.R. MacKichan M.L. Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Mercurio F. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing of p105 and p100 not only serves to generate p50 and p52 but also plays a role in liberating specific NF-κB complexes such as the RelB-containing complexes. Whereas the processing of p105 is constitutive and largely cotranslational (14Lin L. DeMartino G.N. Greene W.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 819-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), the processing of p100 is tightly regulated through its inducible phosphorylation and polyubiquitination (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The induction of p100 phosphorylation and subsequent processing are mediated by the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase IKKα (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol.

Interestingly, neither IKKβ nor IKKγ is required for this non-canonical NF-κB pathway, although both IKKβ and IKKγ are essential for the canonical NF-κB activation (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G.

The tightly regulated p100 processing may be important for proper regulation of NF-κB function in cell growth and survival. Recent gene targeting studies indicated that the germ line knock-out of nfκb2 gene with no expression of both p100 and p52 results in severe defects in B-cell function and impairment in the formation of proper architecture in peripheral lymphoid organs (22Caamano J.H.

Cell. 1995; 80: 321-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Similarly, mice having defects in p100 processing, such as the alymphoplasia mice (carrying nik gene mutation) (for details see Ref. 25Miyawaki S. Nakamura Y. Suzuka H. Koba M. Yasumizu R. Ikehara S. Shibata Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and the A/WySnJ mice (carrying mutations in the B-cell-activating factor receptor gene) (for details see Ref. 26Thompson J.S.

Science. 2001; 293: 2108-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), also show similar phenotypes. Conversely, overexpression of p52 in the absence of p100 in p100 knock-in mice leads to lymphocyte hyperplasia and transformation (27Ishikawa H. Carrasco D. Claudio E. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In humans, chromosomal translocations that cause nfκb2 gene rearrangement, leading to constitutive processing of p100, are associated with the development of various lymphomas (5Rayet B. Gelinas C.

Interestingly, deregulated p100 processing also is found to be associated with T-cell transformation by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 and many other human cancers (7Sun S.-C. Xiao G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C.

Because proper processing of p100 plays an essential role in the development and maturation of lymphoid organs, whereas deregulated p100 processing contributes to human malignancies, it is very important to define the detailed mechanisms of p100 processing. In this study, we have demonstrated that NIK not only activates its downstream kinase IKKα but also recruits IKKα into the p100 complex. This “docking” function of NIK requires the C-terminal serines, Ser-866 and Ser-870, of p100. Interestingly, both the N- and C-terminal regions of p100 contain IKKα phosphorylation sites. These IKKα phosphorylation sites together with the IKKα docking sites are essential for NIK-induced ubiquitination and processing of p100. Expression Vectors and Antibodies—Expression vectors encoding p100 and its serine mutants, p100 S866A/S870A and p100 S866A/S870A/S872A (labeled as p100SS/AA and p100SSS/AAA in the figures, respectively), HA-tagged NIK and its mutants, IKKα and its mutants, β-TrCP, and ubiquitin have been described previously (15Xiao G.

Other p100 serine mutants also were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pCMV4p100 as template. p100 S99A, p100 S108A, p100 S115A, p100 S123A, and p100 S872A harbor serine to alanine substitution at residues 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872, respectively. p1004 S/A and p1005 S/A mutants were obtained by substituting serines 99, 108, 115, and 123 or 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872 with alanines. GST-p100C and GST-p100C SSS/AAA were generated previously (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol.

GST fusion proteins containing the N-terminal regions of p100 (GST-p100N) and their serine mutants were created by similar strategies. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (anti-HA-HRP, 3F10) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The antibody recognizing the N terminus of p100 (anti-p100N) was kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene (35Beraud C. Sun S.C. Ganchi P. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell.

Cell Culture and Transfection—The kidney carcinoma cell line 293 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. 293 cells (1 × 105, seeded in a six-well plate) were transfected with DEAE-dextran (36Holbrook N. Gulino A. Ruscetti F. Virology. 1987; 157: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting (IB) and Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—293 cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors using DEAE-dextran and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture followed by IB or co-IP assays as described previously (15Xiao G.

In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

The phosphorylated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was used subsequently for IB to analyze the protein level of substrates. In Vivo Ubiquitin Conjugation Assays—293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and p100 or its mutants in the presence or absence of NIK. After 36–48 h post-transfection, the cells were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and immediately subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-p100 antibody. The agarose beads were washed three times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer followed by two additional washes with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer supplemented with 1 m urea. The eluted ubiquitin-conjugated p100 by SDS loading buffer was analyzed by IB using anti-HA-HRP (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

The EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). NIK Promotes the Binding of IKKα to p100 —As described earlier (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 17Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. The EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), overexpressed IKKα or its activation by various stimuli that trigger the canonical NF-κB pathway fails to induce productive processing of p100. However, the expression of a very low amount of NIK could strongly induce the processing of p100. These findings suggest that besides activating the catalytic activity of IKKα, NIK may exert additional functions in the induction of p100 processing. In this regard, our previous studies indicated that NIK but not IKKα could interact efficiently with p100, although IKKα could associate physically with NIK (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 33Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21081-21085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, we predicted that NIK might target IKKα into the p100 complex. To test this possibility, we performed co-IP assays. As expected, no significant binding between p100 and IKKα could be detected when these two proteins were coexpressed in 293 cells (Fig. 1A, top panel, lane 2). Interestingly, however, the two proteins became associated stably when NIK also was expressed in cells (lane 3). Because NIK induces the catalytic activity of IKKα (37Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), we examined whether the induction of IKKα/p100 binding by NIK is the result of activation of IKKα. The co-IP studies were performed using dominant-active (SS/EE) and kinase-inactive (SS/AA) forms of IKKα. In the absence of NIK, neither the IKKα SS/EE nor the IKKα SS/AA could interact significantly with p100 (lanes 4 and 6). On the other hand, both of the IKK mutants formed a stable complex with p100 in the presence of NIK (lanes 5 and 7). Thus, the NIK-induced recruitment of IKKα to p100 is independent of the catalytic activity of IKKα. This finding provides an explanation for the low efficiency of IKKα SS/EE in inducing p100 processing (Fig. 1A, bottom panel, lane 4). We then investigated whether the recruitment of IKKα to p100 requires the kinase activity of NIK. When coexpressed with IKKα and p100, both the wild type NIK and its kinase-inactive form (NIK KA) could promote the binding of IKKα to p100 (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 3 and 5), although the NIK KA failed to induce p100 processing (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Together with the results presented in Fig. 1A, these observations suggest that NIK promotes the IKKα/p100 binding via a physical mechanism rather than via catalytic activation of IKKα. In this regard, prior studies have shown that the alymphoplasia mutation of NIK diminishes its physical interaction with IKKα or p100, although it does not affect its catalytic activity (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 38Luftig M.A. Cahir-McFarland E. Mosialos G. Kieff E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14602-14606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the NIK alymphoplasia mutant also exhibited reduced activity in promoting the IKKα/p100 association (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lane 4), a defect that was associated with its low efficiency in inducing p100 processing (bottom panel, lane 4). Because NIK KA mutant failed to cooperate with IKKα in inducing p100 processing (bottom panel, lane 5), although it could efficiently recruit IKKα into p100 (upper panel, lane 5), it is very interesting to test whether NIK KA mutant induces p100 processing in the presence of the constitutive form of IKKα. As expected, both NIK wild type and KA could efficiently promote the binding of IKKα SS/EE to p100 (upper panel, lanes 7 and 8). However, coexpression of NIK KA and IKKα SS/EE still failed to trigger p100 processing (bottom panel, lane 8), suggesting that NIK has an additional function besides activating and recruiting IKKα into p100, which is also required for inducible p100 processing. Nevertheless, these results clearly indicate that the ability of NIK to bind to IKKα and p100 is essential for recruiting IKKα to p100 and that this novel function of NIK does not require the catalytic activity of NIK or IKKα. Serines 866 and 870 of p100 Serve as a Docking Site for NIK-induced IKKα Binding—We have previously shown that two C-terminal serines, Ser-866 and Ser-870, of p100 are essential for NIK-induced p100 processing (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Although these two serines are located in the IKKα phosphorylation site of p100, it remains unclear whether they serve as the direct target of IKKα. We examined whether these two critical residues are involved in the binding of p100 by IKKα. As expected, the wild type p100 formed a stable complex with IKKα in the presence of NIK (Fig. 2A, top panel, lane 2). In contrast, the p100 mutant harboring serine to alanine substitutions at serines 866 and 870 (p100 S866A/S870A) was largely defective in the inducible binding to IKKα (lane 4). The failure of p100 S866A/S870A to recruit IKKα was not attributed to its inability in binding NIK, because a similar level of NIK binding activity was detected with wild type p100 and p100 S866A/S870A (Fig. 2B, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). The expression levels of these two different p100 constructs as well as NIK in the different cells were also comparable (middle and bottom panels). These data strongly imply that serines 866 and 870 may function as a docking site for NIK-induced IKKα binding. Serine 872, but Not Serines 866 and 870, of p100 Serves as the IKKα Phosphorylation Site—Our previous studies have indicated that serines 866, 870, and 872 of p100 are candidates for IKKα phosphorylation sites, because mutation of these serines abolishes the phosphorylation of the C-terminal region of p100 by IKKα (16Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar, 17Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. The EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). However, it has remained unclear whether all of the three serines or just some of them are the IKKα targets. To answer this question, GST-p100C mutants harboring serine to alanine substitutions at serines 866 and 870 (S866A/S870A), serine 872 (S872A), or all three serines (SSS/AAA) were examined for phosphorylation by IKKα. As expected, purified recombinant IKKα efficiently phosphorylated wild type GST-p100C but not the GST-p100C SSS/AAA (Fig. 3A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). Surprisingly, mutation of serines 866 and 870 did not affect the p100 phosphorylation by IKKα (lane 3). On the other hand, the p100C mutant harboring serine 872 mutation (GST-p100C S872A) completely lost its ability to be phosphorylated by IKKα (lane 4). Thus, serine 872, but not serines 866 and 870, serves as a target of IKKα. Taken together with the data presented in Fig. 2, these findings suggest that serines 866 and 870 are required for the recruitment of IKKα to p100 but are not the actual phosphorylation sites for IKKα. To address the role of serine 872 in the inducible processing of p100, wild type p100 or p100 mutant harboring this serine mutation (p100 S872A) was transfected into 293 cells either in the absence or presence of the p100-processing inducer, NIK. Compared with the wild type p100, the p100 S872A exhibited a dramatic defect in NIK-induced processing (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lanes 2 and 4). Interestingly, the mutation of serine 872 to a phosphomimetic residue (aspartic acid) generated a p100 mutant (p100 S872D) that exhibited a higher inducible processing ability than p100 wild type (lane 6). In contrast, the p100 mutant harboring serine to aspartic acid substitutions at serines 866 and 870 (p100 S866A/S870D) was defective in NIK-induced processing (lane 8), a phenotype similar to that of p100 S866A/S870A (lane 10) (15Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). These results further suggested that serine 872, but not serine 866 or 870, is an IKKα phosphorylation site at p100 C terminus. Thus, the three C-terminal serines of p100 regulate its inducible processing through different mechanisms. Identification of Additional IKKα Phosphorylation Sites within p100 That Regulate p100 Processing—The findings that the C-terminal IKKα phosphorylation site (serine 872) of p100 is only partially required for inducible p100 processing suggested the possibility that p100 contains additional phosphorylation sites for IKKα. To address this possibility, we generated GST fusion proteins containing p100 mutants with progressive C-terminal truncations (Fig. 4A). Indeed, IKKα phosphorylated p100 mutants lacking the C-terminal phosphorylation site (p100 1–753 and 1–680) (see Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2), thus suggesting the existence of new IKKα targets in the N-terminal region of p100. Further truncations from the C terminus revealed that the N-terminal 132 amino acids were sufficient for IKKα-mediated phosphorylation of the p100 N-terminal region (lane 5); however, a shorter p100 mutant containing the first 84 amino acids, p100-(1–84), was no longer phosphorylated by IKKα (lane 6). Thus, the major N-terminal phosphorylation sites of p100 appear to be located within a 48-amino acid region covering residues 84–132. The N-terminal phosphorylation region of p100 contains four serines, serines 99, 108, 115, and 123. Mutations were introduced to these putative phosphorylation sites either individually or in combination, and the generated GST fusion proteins were subjected to in vitro kinase assays. As shown in Fig. 4C, singular substitution of any of these serines partially affected IKKα-mediated phosphorylation (upper panel, lanes 2, 3, 4, and 5). However, mutation of all of the four serines simultaneously and largely blocked the phosphorylation by IKKα (upper panel, lane 6). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of p100 contains multiple IKKα phosphorylation sites. Consistent with this idea, the N-terminal region of p100 incorporated more radiolabeled phosphates than the C-terminal region of p100 in the in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 4D). Thus, serines 99, 108, 115, and"

Owing to changes in the Earth's orbit around the Sun, it is thought that insolation in the Northern Hemisphere varied more strongly than today on seasonal timescales2, which would have led to corresponding changes in the seasonal temperature cycle3. Here we present seasonally resolved proxy records using corals from the northernmost Red Sea, which record climate during the last interglacial period, the late Holocene epoch and the present. We find an increased seasonality in the temperature recorded in the last interglacial coral. Today, climate in the northern Red Sea is sensitive to the North Atlantic Oscillation4,5, a climate oscillation that strongly influences winter temperatures and precipitation in the North Atlantic region. From our coral records and simulations with a coupled atmosphere–ocean circulation model, we conclude that a tendency towards the high-index state of the North Atlantic Oscillation during the last interglacial period, which is consistent with European proxy records6,7,8, contributed to the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle in the Middle East."

Because gene expression of many proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines is controlled by this factor, the concept emerged that NF-κB and its upstream regulator IκB kinase are essential components of the innate antiviral immune response to infectious pathogens. In contrast to this common view we report here that NF-κB activity promotes efficient influenza virus production. On a molecular level this is due to NF-κB-dependent viral induction of the proapoptotic factors tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and FasL, which enhance virus propagation in an autocrine and paracrine fashion.

The NF-κB/IκB family of transcription factors promotes the expression of well over 150 different genes, such as cytokine or chemokine genes or genes encoding for adhesion molecules or anti- and proapoptotic proteins (1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Google Scholar). The canonical mechanism of NF-κB activation includes activation of IKK, which phosphorylates the inhibitor of NF-κB, IκB, and targets the protein for subsequent degradation (2Delhase M. Karin M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 491-503Google Scholar, 3Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Google Scholar). This leads to the release and migration of the transcriptionally active NF-κB factors, such as p65 or p50, to the nucleus (4Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Google Scholar, 5Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). The IKK complex consists of at least three isozymes of IKK, IKK1/IKKα, IKK2/IKKβ, and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKγ. The most important isozyme for NF-κB activation via the degradation of IκB is IKK2 (6Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Google Scholar), whereas IKK1 seems to primarily phosphorylate other factors of the NF-κB/IKK family, namely p100/p52 (7Xiao G. Cvijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T.

Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Google Scholar), NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (11Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell.

NF-κB co-regulates one of the most important antiviral gene expression events, the transcriptional induction of IFNβ (15Maniatis T. Falvo J.V. Kim T.H. Kim T.K. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Wathelet M.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 609-620Google Scholar). IFNβ is one of the first antiviral cytokines to be expressed upon virus infection, initiating an autoamplification loop to cause an efficient and strong type I IFN response (16Taniguchi T. Takaoka A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 111-116Google Scholar). The IFNβ enhanceosome, which mediates the inducible expression of IFNβ, carries binding sites for transcription factors of three families, namely the AP-1 family members and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase targets c-Jun and ATF-2, the NF-κB factors p50 and p65, and the interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) (17Hiscott J. Pitha P. Genin P. Nguyen H. Heylbroeck C. Mamane Y. Algarte M. Lin R. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 1-13Google Scholar, 18Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Google Scholar). Besides NF-κB a main determinant of a strong virus- and dsRNA-induced IFNβ response is IRF-3. Recently the IKK family members IKK-ϵ and TBK-1 were identified as IRF-3 kinases (19Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Google Scholar, 20Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Google Scholar). Both kinases appear to act downstream of the GTPase Rac1 and the p21-activated kinase PAK1 in response to Sendai virus and influenza virus infection (21Ehrhardt C. Kardinal C. Wurzer W.J. Wolff T. Pleschka S. Planz O. Ludwig S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 567: 230-238Google Scholar). NF-κB is activated by multiple families of viruses, including HIV-1, HTLV-1, hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and influenza viruses (22Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 143-151Google Scholar). Although for some of these viruses, e.g. retroviruses or oncogenic viruses, activation of this transcription factor may support viral replication, it is a common view that in general NF-κB acts in an antiviral fashion upon infection with RNA viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus, Sendai virus, or influenza virus (23Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Google Scholar, 24Wang X. Li M. Zheng H. Muster T. Palese P. Beg A.A. Garcia-Sastre A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11566-11573Google Scholar). RNA virus infections commonly result in activation of an innate antiviral response that includes expression of type I interferons. In addition to IFNβ, also other genes involved in the induction of inflammation and immune responses are regulated by NF-κB, such as IL-6, TNF-α, or IL-12. Accordingly, vesicular stomatitis virus-induced expression of IFNβ, IL-6, and IL-12 is impaired in cells deficient for the NF-κB activator IκB kinase 2 (IKK2) (23Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Google Scholar). Another mode of NF-κB interference with virus propagation is through its capability to regulate apoptosis, a morphologically and biochemically defined form of cell death (25Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar) that has been demonstrated to play a role in a variety of diseases including virus infections (26Razvi E.S. Welsh R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 1-60Google Scholar). Apoptosis is mainly regarded to be a host cell defense against virus infections because many viruses express antiapoptotic proteins to prevent this cellular response. NF-κB is mainly regarded as a survival factor by up-regulating genes encoding for antiapoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-XL, A20, or cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (27Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Google Scholar, 28Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar). However, NF-κB was also reported to act proapoptotically under certain conditions, e.g. by up-regulating the death-inducing CD95 ligand and its receptor (27Baichwal V.R. Baeuerle P.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R94-R96Google Scholar, 28Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar). For example, Dengue virus-infected HepG2 hepatocytes undergo apoptosis in an NF-κB-dependent manner (29Marianneau P. Cardona A. Edelman L. Deubel V. Despres P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3244-3249Google Scholar), while NF-κB activation induced by the hepatitis C virus core protein protects cells from apoptosis in the same cell line (30Marusawa H. Hijikata M. Chiba T. Shimotohno K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4713-4720Google Scholar). Thus, the concept of a context-dependent regulation of apoptosis by NF-κB has emerged (28Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar). A common viral inducer of NF-κB-dependent responses appears to be dsRNA. Most RNA viruses produce dsRNA-like replication intermediates representing a shared molecular pattern that may be sensed by the cell as an alert signal (31Majde J.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 259-272Google Scholar). Activation of IκB kinase and NF-κB by influenza virus or influenza viral products is well documented (32Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1480-1484Google Scholar, 33Ludwig S. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Viral. Immunol. 1999; 12: 175-196Google Scholar, 34Julkunen I. Melen K. Nyqvist M. Pirhonen J. Sareneva T. Matikainen S.

Wolff T. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 46-52Google Scholar); however, the function of this signaling module in the virus-infected cell is not yet as clear. The knowledge so far is restricted to data obtained with a recombinant virus termed delNS1 with a deletion of the complete coding region of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (37Garcia-Sastre A. Egorov A. Matassov D. Brandt S. Levy D.E. Durbin J.E. Palese P. Muster T. Virology. 1998; 252: 324-330Google Scholar). Infection of cells with influenza delNS1 virus results in enhanced NF-κB activation and IFNβ production (24Wang X. Li M. Zheng H. Muster T. Palese P. Beg A.A. Garcia-Sastre A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11566-11573Google Scholar) as well as enhanced apoptosis (38Zhirnov O.P. Konakova T.E. Wolff T. Klenk H.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1617-1625Google Scholar), suggesting that the NS1 protein is at least a partial antagonist of these presumed antiviral responses. Nevertheless, the consequences of influenza virus-induced NF-κB activation for the outcome of an infection have never been directly addressed yet. Viruses, Cell Lines, and Viral Infections—Avian influenza virus A/Bratislava/79 (H7N7; fowl plague virus (FPV)) and human influenza viruses A/Puerto-Rico/8/34 (H1N1; PR8), A/Asia/57 (H2N2; Asia), and A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2; Victoria) were taken from the virus strain collection of the Institute of Virology, Giessen, Germany, and were used for the infection of different cell lines. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and African green monkey kidney cells (Vero) were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A549 human lung carcinoma cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Primary human endothelial cells were obtained from Clonetics and cultured as described previously (39Goebeler M. Kilian K. Gillitzer R. Kunz M. Yoshimura T. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Blood. 1999; 93: 857-865Google Scholar). A549, MDCK, and Vero cell lines stably expressing transdominant IκBα mutant as well as constitutively active and dominant negative IKK2 were generated with a retroviral transduction approach using the pCFG5-IEGZ retroviral vector system (40Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Google Scholar) and amphotrophic Phoenix producer cell lines essentially as described by Denk et al. (41Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Google Scholar). For infection cells were washed with PBS incubated with virus at the indicated multiplicities of infection (MOI) diluted in PBS/BA (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) for 1 h at room temperature. The inoculum was aspirated, and cells were incubated with either MEM or Ham's F-12 containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics. 9 or 24 h post-infection (p.i.) supernatants were collected to assess the number of infectious particles (plaque titers) in the samples. Briefly, MDCK cells grown 90% confluent in 6-well dishes were washed with PBS and infected with serial dilutions of the supernatants in PBS/BA for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was aspirated, and cells were incubated with 2 ml of MEM/BA (medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics) supplemented with 0.6% agar (Oxoid), 0.3% DEAE-dextran (Amersham Biosciences), and 1.5% NaHCO3 at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2–3 days. Virus plaques were visualized by staining with neutral red. Inhibitors, Antibodies, and Reagents—Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK or inhibitor control Z-FA-FMK (Alexis Biochemicals, Grünberg, Germany) was supplied ready-to-use at a concentration of 2 mm in Me2SO. Me2SO was used as solvent control at a final concentration of 2%, representing the highest inhibitor concentration. The mouse antipoly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (anti-PARP) monoclonal antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) or extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) Western blots were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-8440 or sc-154, respectively). mAbs against TRAIL, TRAIL-receptor 1 (R1) and -R2, CD95, and CD95L for FACS, as well as recombinant FLAG- or His-tagged human TRAIL and recombinant FasL/CD95L, are available from Alexis Biochemicals. Soluble TRAIL-receptor 2 (TRAIL-R2-Fc), soluble TNF-α receptor (sTNF-R2-Fc), and CD95-Fc were produced as fusion proteins with human IgG-Fc at the Division for Apoptosis Regulation, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany (42Walczak H. Degli-Esposti M.A. Johnson R.S. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Timour M.S. Gerhart M.J. Schooley K.A. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5386-5397Google Scholar). A receptor-neutralizing mAb against the type I IFN receptor was purchased from PBL Biomedical Laboratories. A goat antiserum against the influenza virus NP was a kind gift of Robert G. Webster, Memphis, TN. Plasmids, Transfections, and Western Blots—The IFNβ-promoterluciferase plasmid was kindly provided by J. Hiscott, Montreal, Canada. The 3×NF-κB reporter plasmid was described previously (35Flory E. Kunz M. Scheller C. Jassoy C. Stauber R. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8307-8314Google Scholar). MDCK cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to a protocol by Basler et al. (43Basler C.F. Wang X. Muhlberger E. Volchkov V. Paragas J. Klenk H.D. Garcia-Sastre A. Palese P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12289-12294Google Scholar). Luciferase-reporter gene assays were carried out as described previously (44Ludwig S. Ehrhardt C. Neumeier E.R. Kracht M. Rapp U.R. Pleschka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10990-10998Google Scholar, 45Ludwig S. Wang X. Ehrhardt C. Zheng H. Donelan N. Planz O. Pleschka S. García-Sastre A. Heins G. Wolff T. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11166-11171Google Scholar). For Western blots cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium glycerolphosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm benzamidine) on ice for 10–20 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged, and protein contents in the supernatants were estimated employing a protein dye reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes. Flow Cytometry Analysis—TRAIL was detected by an intracellular staining procedure. A549 cell lines were infected with FPV at an MOI of 5 for 8 h in the presence of 2 μm monensin to avoid protein secretion. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min and subsequently washed twice in permeabilization buffer (0.1% saponin, 1% fetal calf serum, PBS). After incubation with a mAb against TRAIL or isotype control antibodies (BD Biosciences) cells were stained with biotin-SP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dianova) and streptavidin-Cy-chrome (BD Biosciences). In another set of assays CD95, CD95L, and TRAIL detection was performed according to the same protocol but without monensin/saponin treatment. Fluorescence was determined in the FL3-channel using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). All FACS analyses were repeated at least twice and revealed essentially similar results. RNase Protection Assay—A549 cell lines were mock-infected or infected with FPV at a MOI of 1. 24 h p.i. cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified RNA was subjected to the RiboQuant multiprobe RNase protection assay hAPO-3 (Pharmingen, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Influenza A Virus Replication Rescue Assay—A549 cell lines were infected with FPV at a MOI of 1. After 1 h at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed. 6 h after mock infection, 100, 50, 10, 5, or 1 ng/ml recombinant human TRAIL or FasL was added to the medium. 3 h after the addition of TRAIL or CD95L (9 h p.i.) supernatant was collected to assess the number of infectious particles (plaque titers) in the samples. Analysis of the Apoptotic Phosphatidylserine Switch—MDCK cell lines were infected with different influenza A viruses at a MOI of 1. 24 h p.i. cells were washed with PBS, detached from the culture plates with 0.25% trypsin, and spun down. Cell pellets were washed twice with PBS. Annexin V-Alexa568 (Roche Applied Science) staining to detect phosphatidylserine exposure at the outer leaflet of the cell membrane as an early apoptotic marker was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apoptotic cells were detected and quantified by FACS analysis. To analyze the roles of IKK and NF-κB activation during an influenza virus infection we established host cell lines that stably express a dominant negative mutant of IKK2 (IKK KD) or a non-degradable phosphorylation site mutant of IκBα (IκBαmut) (41Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Google Scholar) that both prevent NF-κB activation. In addition an active mutant of IKK2 (IKK EE) was stably expressed in cells resulting in a slightly enhanced NF-κB activity in stimulated or infected cells (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast expression of IKK KD or IκBαmut in these cell lines resulted in an efficient reduction of NF-κB activation. TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation was impaired (Fig. 1A), and influenza virus-induced transcription from a NF-κB-responsive promoter element (Fig. 1B) was reduced by about 80–90% in the presence of the mutants. High expression of IKK EE appears to not be well tolerated in a cell line because a strong down-regulation of the transgene is commonly observed after a few passages in all cell types analyzed so far (data not shown). Nevertheless a slight constitutive activity and an enhanced NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity upon stimulation or virus infection were detected in the IKK EE cell lines (Fig. 1, B and C). This was also consistently observed when the artificial NF-κB reporter gene construct was replaced by a reporter gene plasmid harboring the IFNβ promoter/enhanceosome (Fig. 1C). In line with the data in Fig. 1B the dominant negative mutants also conferred inhibition of transcriptional activation (Fig. 1C), although less pronounced because of the involvement of other virus-induced transcription factors controlling IFNβ expression. These findings support earlier reports suggesting that NF-κB regulates IFNβ expression as an antiviral function (23Chu W.M. Ostertag D. Li Z.W. Chang L. Chen Y. Hu Y. Williams B. Perrault J. Karin M. Immunity. 1999; 11: 721-731Google Scholar). However, when we examined the efficacy of influenza virus production in these different cell lines, we surprisingly observed exactly the opposite. Virus propagation was impaired upon NF-κB inhibition and slightly enhanced in cells expressing the active form of IKK EE (Fig. 1, D and E). The effects were similar in MDCK epithelial cells and in Vero cells (Fig. 1D) and could also be observed in primary human endothelial cells or by infection with influenza viruses of other subtypes (e.g. H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) (data not shown). Although the levels of reduction and enhancement of virus propagation were not very pronounced, which may in part be due to inefficient action of the transgenes in cells from another species, it should be stressed that similar effects were consistently observed in each experiment within a set of individual experiments. Vero cells do not express type I interferons (46Diaz M.O. Ziemin S. Le Beau M.M. Pitha P. Smith S.D. Chilcote R.R. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5259-5263Google Scholar), excluding a prominent involvement of these cytokines in the observed effects. Inhibition or enhancement of virus propagation correlated with the efficacy of transgene action (data not shown) and was strongest in A549 lung epithelial cells, where the differences in virus titers between the different cell lines were around 10-fold (Fig. 1E). These different efficacies of virus production in the different cell lines were not due to a delay or shift in replication kinetics because we observed the same pattern at every time point throughout a 48-h period of virus growth regardless of whether virus in the supernatant or cell-associated virus was examined (data not shown). These results differ from studies obtained upon infections of the respective NF-κB-defective CRL cell lines with Borna disease virus, another nucleus-replicating negative-strand RNA virus. Here, inhibition of NF-κB had no pronounced effect on replication; however, activation of the pathway by expression of IKK EE resulted in a strongly impaired virus replication because of a massive induction of type I interferons. 2O. Planz and S. Ludwig, unpublished data. This suggests a crucial function of NF-κB specifically for influenza virus replication, which appears to occur independently of a type I interferon response. Because NF-κB is a regulator of both pro- and antiapoptotic genes (28Barkett M. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Google Scholar), we examined viral induction of apoptosis in the different NF-κB cell lines. To monitor an early apoptotic event we chose the switch of phosphatidylserine to the outer leaflet of cells, a process that can be examined by annexin V stainings in FACS analysis (Fig. 2A). Compared with the vector control a higher number of cells were found to be annexin V-positive in infected IKK EE cell lines, whereas fewer cells were positive when NF-κB was inhibited (Fig. 2A). Another early hallmark of apoptosis induction is caspase activation. This could be monitored by proteolytic cleavage of caspase substrates, such as PARP. Influenza virus infection resulted in a significant cleavage of PARP in vector cell lines that was further enhanced in IKK EE-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). In contrast, virus-induced PARP cleavage was significantly reduced in infected cells expressing transdominant negative mutants of IKK or IκBα (Fig. 2B). Essentially the same patterns of early apoptosis induction that matched with viral replication efficacies were also observed with other virus isolates, such as human isolates of the H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 subtypes (data not shown). Thus, we face a general phenomenon in which NF-κB acts in a proviral and proapoptotic rather than an antiapoptotic fashion in the context of an influenza virus infection. These findings are consistent with our earlier report demonstrating that caspase activation is required for efficient virus propagation (47Wurzer W.J. Planz O. Ehrhardt C. Giner M. Silberzahn T. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2717-2728Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present data links viral NF-κB activation to this phenomenon. Taken together, the data suggested that during influenza virus infection NF-κB up-regulates one or more proapoptotic factors, which results in enhanced virus production. Therefore, we examined virus-induced gene expression of a variety of apoptosis regulators, such as caspase 8, CD95/Fas, death receptor 3 (DR3), TRAIL or TNF-R1 in vector, and IKK EE- or IKK KD-expressing cell lines using RNase protection assays (Fig. 3A). One of the genes that was strongly up-regulated upon virus infection in vector-transfected or IKK EE-expressing cell lines but completely absent in cell lines expressing IKK KD encodes TRAIL. TRAIL was expressed in increasing amounts over time during an influenza virus infection (Fig. 3B), and inhibition of NF-κB signaling by IKK KD or IκBαmut resulted in a complete block of virus-induced TRAIL synthesis (Fig. 3C). Another gene that was found to be up-regulated upon infection in a NF-κB-dependent manner was the death receptor Fas/CD95 gene (Fig. 3A). Subsequent FACS analysis revealed that this is also true on the protein level; both Fas/CD95 and its ligand FasL/CD95L were induced by influenza virus infection on the protein level, and the expression of both genes was regulated by NF-κB (Fig. 3D). In contrast, the TRAIL-R1 and -R2 are not regulated by influenza virus infection but are constitutively expressed both in A549 cells and in primary human endothelial cells (data not shown). To further test whether the apoptosis inducers TRAIL and the Fas/FasL system might be involved in NF-κB-dependent enhancement of influenza virus replication, we determined virus titers in the absence or presence of TRAIL-R2-Fc or CD95-R-Fc, efficient inhibitors of TRAIL or CD95L, respectively (42Walczak H. Degli-Esposti M.A. Johnson R.S. Smolak P.J. Waugh J.Y. Boiani N. Timour M.S. Gerhart M.J. Schooley K.A. Smith C.A. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5386-5397Google Scholar, 48Washburn B. Weigand M.A. Grosse-Wilde A. Janke M. Stahl H. Rieser E. Sprick M.R. Schirrmacher V. Walczak H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1814-1821Google Scholar). Both agents not only resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of virus production if applied individually (Fig. 4, A and C) but also acted synergistically to reduce virus titers by more than 1 order of magnitude (Fig. 4C). This indicates that both TRAIL and CD95L are proviral factors. In contrast, presence of soluble TNF-R2-Fc (48Washburn B. Weigand M.A. Grosse-Wilde A. Janke M. Stahl H. Rieser E. Sprick M.R. Schirrmacher V. Walczak H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1814-1821Google Scholar), a receptor for another proapoptotic and virus-induced NF-κB-dependent cytokine, did not lead to a significant reduction of virus titers (Fig. 4A), although the same concentration of the reagent efficiently blocked TNF-α-induced IκBα degradation (data not shown). Consistent with the finding that TRAIL and FasL support virus propagation, stimulation of infected cells with low concentrations of recombinant human TRAIL or FasL enhanced virus production in A549 cells and rescued the phenotype of NF-κB deficiency in the different cell lines (Fig. 4, B and D). Because IFNβ is also regulated by NF-κB and because type I interferons are apoptosis inducers, IFNα/β might still play a supportive role in the observed phenomena. However, when type I IFN receptor-blocking antibodies were added to the cell culture medium, we observed slightly enhanced rather than reduced virus titers (Fig. 4E). No difference was observed in IκBαmut-expressing cell lines, indicative of a block of IFN synthesis in cells with impaired NF-κB signaling. These findings demonstrate that small amounts of type I interferons are still induced in influenza A virus-infected wild type cells but not in IκBα-expressing cell lines. However, these small amounts of IFNα/β confer a slight antiviral rather than a proviral effect (Fig. 4E). Thus, the mechanism by which NF-κB acts in a proviral manner in influenza virus-infected cells includes gene regulation of apoptosis inducers such as TRAIL and CD95L. The action of these proviral apoptosis inducers appears to be dominant over a potential antiviral effect conferred by IFNβ or TNF-α, which both are only expressed in very little amounts (Fig. 4E and data not shown). Although the role of NF-κB in influenza virus-infected cells has never been studied in detail, it was a common thought that both NF-κB activation and apoptosis induction are antiviral responses to influenza virus infections. According to the data presented here NF-κB indeed regulates expression of antivirally acting cytokines such as IFNβ; however, the effect that is finally dominant for the outcome of virus propagation is the regulation of provirally acting factors such as TRAIL, Fas, and FasL. The inhibiting or enhancing effects of the different NF-κB mutants on virus propagation in the stably transduced cell lines might be considered relatively small with regard to a fast replicating virus such as influenza virus. However, several points have to be taken into account when judging the significance of the effects. First of all the dominant negative transgenes do not fully block NF-κB activation resulting in a certain degree of leakiness. Thus, a maximum of 80–90% inhibition of NF-κB activity correlates quite well with an up to 10-fold inhibition of virus replication. Furthermore, NF-κB acts in both anti- and proviral gene expression. This means that the proviral activity observed here is diluted to a certain extent by antiviral gene expression events, e.g. control of IFNβ expression (Fig. 4E). This is not the case for the provirally acting NF-κB-controlled gene products such as TRAIL and FasL, and consequently the combined blockade of these factors by the receptor-Fc fusion proteins results in an inhibition of virus propagation by more than 1 log (Fig. 4C). It is likely that there are still other NF-κB-controlled factors acting in the same way and further contributing to the effects. Although earlier reports demonstrated NF-κB-dependent Fas and FasL expression (49Matsui K. Fine A. Zhu B. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ju S.T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3469-3473Google Scholar, 50Chan H. Bartos D.P. Owen-Schaub L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2098-2108Google Scholar, 51Hsu S.C. Gavrilin M.A. Lee H.H. Wu C.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 2948-2956Google Scholar) and coexpression of both proteins on the surface of influenza virus-infected cells (52Fujimoto I. Takizawa T. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 426-431Google Scholar), little is known about the virus-induced transcriptional regulation of TRAIL so far. Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that expression of TRAIL can be induced in a NF-κB-dependent manner in Jurkat T-cells (53Baetu T.M. Kwon H. Sharma S. Grandvaux N. Hiscott J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3164-3173Google Scholar). We now show here that this is also true for a viral inducer in epithelial cells. Our data are supported by findings from a recent transcriptional profiling approach identifying the TRAIL gene among 84 of 13,000 genes that were deregulated in response to infection with a human influenza virus (54Geiss G.K. Salvatore M. Tumpey T.M. Carter V.S. Wang X. Basler C.F. Taubenberger J.K. Bumgarner R.E. Palese P. Katze M.G. Garcia-Sastre A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10736-10741Google Scholar). Furthermore, TRAIL and/or TRAIL-R1/2 have been shown to be up-regulated during infections with several other viruses (48Washburn B. Weigand M.A. Grosse-Wilde A. Janke M. Stahl H. Rieser E. Sprick M.R. Schirrmacher V. Walczak H. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1814-1821Google Scholar, 55Sedger L.M. Shows D.M. Blanton R.A. Peschon J.J. Goodwin R.G. Cosman D. Wiley S.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 920-926Google Scholar, 56Vidalain P.O. Azocar O. Lamouille B. Astier A. Rabourdin-Combe C. Servet-Delprat C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 556-559Google Scholar, 57Mundt B. Kuhnel F. Zender L. Paul Y. Tillmann H. Trautwein C. Manns M.P. Kubicka S. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 94-96Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this is an antiviral response to selectively kill infected cells or cells of the immune system. However, our data clearly indicate that in the case of influenza virus infection NF-κB-dependent expression of TRAIL and the Fas/FasL system and subsequent induction of early apoptotic processes are proviral events. Thus, although the cell may aim to fully execute the apoptotic program to prevent spread of infection, the virus appears to take advantage of the early apoptotic events such as caspase activation. This is fully consistent with our earlier observation that activity of caspases, in particular caspase 3, is required for efficient virus propagation in infected cells that do not yet exhibit morphological changes connected with late apoptosis, such as membrane blebbing or DNA condensation (47Wurzer W.J. Planz O. Ehrhardt C. Giner M. Silberzahn T. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2717-2728Google Scholar). With respect to the step in the viral life cycle that is affected we observed that caspase activity can promote nucleocytoplasmic export of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes, most likely through facilitating the passive transport process (47Wurzer W.J. Planz O. Ehrhardt C. Giner M. Silberzahn T. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2717-2728Google Scholar). Strikingly, this is consistent with an earlier finding, where overexpression of the antiviral protein Bcl-2 leads to reduced influenza virus titers and retention of the viral ribonucleoprotein in the nucleus (58Hinshaw V.S.

It therefore seems that influenza virus has acquired the capability of taking advantage of the protection machinery of the host cells, thereby supporting viral replication. It is more efficient for a viral invader to take advantage of existing cellular activities rather than actively induce such processes in the host cell. In line with this assumption the virus needs mechanisms to keep a balance between limitation of the antiviral response and maintenance of sufficient signaling strength to support virus growth. Such a balance control may be provided by the viral NS1 protein, which keeps activities of certain transcription factors in a tolerated limit (24Wang X. Li M. Zheng H. Muster T. Palese P. Beg A.A. Garcia-Sastre A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11566-11573Google Scholar, 45Ludwig S. Wang X. Ehrhardt C. Zheng H. Donelan N. Planz O. Pleschka S. García-Sastre A. Heins G. Wolff T. J.

Virol. 2000; 74: 7989-7996Google Scholar), thereby preventing an overflow of an antiviral response but still allowing some proviral proteins to be produced. Although NS1 may prevent dsRNA-induced activation of IRF-3, which mainly controls the type I IFN response, the protein will not prevent induction of NF-κB by viral proteins (35Flory E. Kunz M. Scheller C. Jassoy C. Stauber R. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8307-8314Google Scholar). In support of such a balanced response we observed that recombinant TRAIL or recombinant CD95L only enhanced virus propagation if cells were stimulated late in infection in concentrations up to 10–20 ng/ml or 50 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 4, B and D). Earlier stimulation or higher concentrations of TRAIL or CD95L resulted in a loss of the supportive effects (data not shown). This late requirement of TRAIL correlates well with the expression kinetics of the protein (Fig. 3C) and the observed late requirement for caspase activity in the viral replication cycle (47Wurzer W.J. Planz O. Ehrhardt C. Giner M. Silberzahn T. Pleschka S. Ludwig S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2717-2728Google Scholar). Furthermore, the recent finding that influenza A virus strains express a proapoptotic protein, PB1-F2, late in the virus life cycle is consistent with a requirement of apoptosis induction for efficient virus growth (60Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Google Scholar). In summary, we have identified NF-κB and some of its proapoptotic target genes as crucial cellular factors for influenza virus replication. This surprising dependence of influenza virus on NF-κB activity may also have implications for future antiviral strategies. We thank J. Hiscott of Montreal, Canada, for providing plasmids."

https://openalex.org/W1969275043,"Polysialic acid (PSA) is a post-translational protein modification that is widely expressed among neural cell types during development. Found predominantly on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), PSA becomes restricted to regions of neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the adult. In the mammalian genome, two polysialyltransferases termed ST8Sia-II and ST8Sia-IV have been hypothesized to be responsible for the production of PSA in vivo. Approaches to discover PSA function have involved the application of endoneuraminidase-N to remove PSA and genetic manipulations in the mouse to deplete either NCAM or ST8Sia-IV. Here we report the production and characterization of mice deficient in the ST8Sia-II polysialyltransferase. We observed alterations in brain PSA expression unlike those observed in mice lacking ST8Sia-IV. This included a PSA deficit in regions of neurogenesis but without changes in the frequency of mitotic neural progenitor cells. In further contrast with ST8Sia-IV deficiency, loss of ST8Sia-II did not impair hippocampal synaptic plasticity but instead resulted in the misguidance of infrapyramidal mossy fibers and the formation of ectopic synapses in the hippocampus. Consistent with studies of animal models bearing these morphological changes, ST8Sia-II-deficient mice exhibited higher exploratory drive and reduced behavioral responses to Pavlovian fear conditioning. PSA produced by the ST8Sia-II polysialyltransferase modifies memory and behavior processes that are distinct from the neural roles reported for ST8Sia-IV. This genetic partitioning of PSA formation engenders discrete neurological processes and reveals that this post-translational modification forms the predominant basis for the multiple functions attributed to the NCAM glycoprotein.

Typically attached to N-glycans, PSA is produced in the Golgi apparatus and is found among a limited number of glycoproteins and predominantly on the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Enzymatic removal of PSA by using endoneuraminidase (endo-N) induces various neurological abnormalities including deficits in hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD), spatial learning, cell migration, and axonal targeting as observed in NCAM-deficient mice (4Tomasiewicz H.

Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 635-643Google Scholar). PSA may alter the adhesive property of NCAM in mediating these processes and may also influence cell-cell communication involving integrins, cadherins, and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (14Rutishauser U. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 304-312Google Scholar, 15Fujimoto I. Bruses J.L. Rutishauser U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31745-31751Google Scholar). Expression of PSA is high in embryonic brain and generally reduced in the adult. However, PSA is continuously present in some adult regions such as the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, coincident to where neurogenesis and neuronal plasticity persist (16Seki T. Arai Y. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 17: 265-290Google Scholar, 17Kuhn H.G. Dickinson-Anson H. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2027-2033Google Scholar). Two genes encoding polysialyltransferases ST8Sia-II (STX) and ST8Sia-IV (PST) are independently capable of directing PSA synthesis in vitro (18Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Google Scholar, 19Kojima N. Yoshida Y. Tsuji S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 119-122Google Scholar, 20Nakayama J. Fukuda M.N. Fredette B. Ranscht B. Fukuda M.

Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Google Scholar). Although ST8Sia-II and -IV share 59% amino acid identity, they are expressed in different spatial and temporal patterns among neural tissues (23Yoshida Y. Kurosawa N. Kanematsu T. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30167-30173Google Scholar, 24Kurosawa N. Yoshida Y. Kojima N. Tsuji S. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 494-503Google Scholar, 25Hildebrandt H. Becker C. Murau M. Gerardy-Schahn R.

To understand how the mammalian neurological system may be modulated in vivo by altered PSA formation, the genetic bases of PSA formation in vivo must be defined. To date this has been explored by analyzing mice lacking the ST8Sia-IV polysialyltransferase. NCAM expression was unaltered by ST8Sia-IV deficiency, whereas specific brain regions exhibited decreased PSA levels, and adult animals bore a restricted phenotype involving an impairment of LTD and LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region (29Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar). However, unlike NCAM deficiency, no decrease in CA3 LTP was observed, and hippocampal mossy fiber projections were unaltered. Here we report the generation and characterization of ST8Sia-II-deficient mice to investigate the role of this polysialyltransferase in neurological activity and define the biological mechanisms that modulate PSA formation and NCAM function. ST8Sia-II Mutagenesis—The murine ST8Sia-II gene was isolated from a mouse129/SvJ genomic DNA library and used to construct a targeting vector. An EcoRI-XhoI fragment containing exon 4 was flanked by two loxP sites as described (30Marth J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 97: 1999-2002Google Scholar). Targeted embryonic stem (ES) clones were identified by PCR and characterized by genomic Southern blotting. ES clones bearing the deleted (Δ) ST8Sia-II allele were obtained after transient expression of Cre recombinase. Targeted ES cells were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice. Mutant ST8Sia-II alleles were bred into the C57BL/6 mouse strain for more than six generations prior to phenotype analysis. RNA Analyses—Total RNA was purified using Trizol solution (Invitrogen) and analyzed by Northern and RT-PCR as described (26Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers (10 μm) used are as follows: mX-Tg1, 5′-CTGGAGGCAGAGGTACAATCAGATC-3′ (nucleotides 104-128); mX-Tg2, 5′-CCTCAAAGGCCCGCTGGATGACAGA-3′ (nucleotides 646-622); mP-Tg1, 5′-AGGCTGGCTCCACCATCTTCCAACA-3′ (nucleotides 173-197); and mP-Tg2, 5′-CTCTGTCACTCTCATTCCGAAAGCC-3′ (nucleotides 625-601). Western Blot Analyses—Brain tissues were isolated and homogenized with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl; 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.1% SDS; 5 mm EDTA) containing proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). Protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Some tissue extracts were incubated with endo-N (31Hallenbeck P.C. Vimr E.R. Yu F. Bassler B. Troy F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3553-3561Google Scholar) for 1 h at 37 °C prior to analysis. Membranes were blocked with 10% dry milk powder in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with either mouse anti-PSA 5A5 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, diluted 1:1000 in TBST) or rat anti-NCAM H28 antibody (Immunotech, diluted 1:200), followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:4000) or anti-rat IgG (1:3000), and detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). BrdUrd Labeling—BrdUrd (20 mg/ml in 0.007 n NaOH and 0.9% NaCl) was delivered by intraperitoneal injection into ST8Sia-II-deficient and wild-type mice (50 mg/kg body weight) five times at 2-h intervals over an 8-h period. One week after the last administration, the mice were deeply anesthetized with Avertin (0.015 ml/g body weight), and brains were removed, fixed with Carnoy (60% ethanol, 30% chloroform, 10% acetic acid), and embedded in paraffin to cut sagittal or coronal sections at 10 μm. Every third section was collected, and 10 sections, which cover 300 μm in the center of the hippocampus, were stained for BrdUrd. BrdUrd-positive cells were detected by BrdUrd-specific monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) and Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Molecular Probes). To measure distribution of embryonic neural stem cells in brains, BrdUrd was administered into pregnant heterozygous mice (100 mg/kg at embryonic day 16, E16) that were mated with heterozygous male mice. Brains from neonatal mice and 10-day postnatal mice were fixed and stained as described above. Histology—For Timm's staining, mice were perfused intracardially with 15-50 ml of 0.37% sodium sulfide solution followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Every third section covering 300 μm in the center of the hippocampus was analyzed as described (9Cremer H. Chazal G. Goridis C. Represa A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1997; 8: 323-335Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical or immunofluorescence staining was performed as described (10Seki T. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3757-3766Google Scholar, 26Ong E. Nakayama J. Angata K. Reyes L. Katsuyama T. Arai Y. Fukuda M. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 415-424Google Scholar, 29Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar). To stain sections with antibodies for β-tubulin (Babco), synapsin I (Chemicon), glial fibrillary acidic protein, or MAP2 (Roche Applied Science), brains were fixed with Carnoy; to stain sections with anti-PSA 12F8 (BD Biosciences), anti-NCAM H28, and anti-calbindin d-28K (Chemicon), brains were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Electrophysiology—Hippocampal slices from 5- to 6-month-old ST8Sia-II-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates were used for recordings. After halothane anesthesia, decapitation, and removal of the brain, the hippocampi were cut with a VT 1000 M vibratome (Leica, Nussloch, Germany) in 300-μm-thick slices in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mm) 250 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, and 1.5 MgCl2, pH 7.3. The slices were then kept at room temperature in a chamber filled with carbogen-bubbled ACSF, containing 125 mm NaCl instead of 250 mm sucrose, for at least 2 h before the start of recordings (modified from Ref. 32Edwards F.A. Konnerth A. Sakmann B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 430: 213-249Google Scholar). In the recording chamber, slices were continuously superfused with carbogen-bubbled ACSF (2-3 ml/min) at room temperature. For recordings in the CA3 region, the slices were prepared as for recordings in the CA1 region but with some modifications. Before decapitation, mice were transcardially perfused with ice-cold ACSF, containing (in mm) 250 sucrose, 25 NaHCO3, 25 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.5 CaCl2, and 6 MgCl2, pH 7.3. Slices were cut according to Claiborne et al. (33Claiborne B.J. Xiang Z. Brown T.H. Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 115-121Google Scholar). Exchange of sucrose-containing ACSF with normal ACSF (containing 2.5 mm CaCl2 and 1.5 mm MgCl2) was performed gradually using peristaltic pumps. Schaffer collateral-CA1 extracellular recordings of focal fEPSPs were obtained from the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region in response to stimulation of Schaffer collaterals by an electrode placed ∼400 μm apart from the recording electrode in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region. Recordings and stimulations were performed with glass pipettes filled with ACSF having a resistance of 2 megohms. Basal synaptic transmission was monitored at 0.033 Hz. The slices were maintained at room temperature. Homosynaptic LTP in the CA1 region was induced by θ-burst stimulation (TBS) applied orthodromically to Schaffer collaterals and recorded extracellularly in the stratum radiatum. A TBS consisted of 10 bursts delivered at 5 Hz. Each burst consisted of four pulses delivered at 100 Hz. Duration of pulses was 0.2 ms, and five TBSs were applied every 20 s to induce LTP (29Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar). The stimulation strength was in the range of 40-70 μA to provide fEPSPs with an amplitude of 50% of the subthreshold maximum. The mean slope of fEPSPs recorded 0-10 min before TBS was taken as 100%. The transient potentiation immediately following TBS (or STP, short term potentiation) was measured as a maximal increase in the fEPSP slope during 1 min after LTP induction. The values of LTP were calculated as increase in the mean slopes of fEPSPs measured 50-60 min after TBS. Mossy fiber-CA3 extracellular recordings and stimulations were both performed with glass pipettes filled with ACSF and having a resistance of 2 megohms with stimulation strength of ∼40 μA. The stimulating electrode was placed close to the internal side of the granule cell layer. The recording pipette was placed in the stratum lucidum of the CA3 region. The mossy fiber responses selected for recording were of 40-60 μV, with a fast rise time and decay of fEPSPs (total duration of fEPSP <10 ms, rise time <3.5 ms), large paired pulse facilitation (>170%), and prominent frequency facilitation (>200%). The selected responses had no hallmarks of polysynaptic activation, such as jagged decay phase with multiple peaks, or variable latencies of fEPSPs. The LTP-inducing high frequency stimulation (HFS) consisted of one train of stimuli applied at 100 Hz for 1 s one time (“weak” stimulation protocol) or repeated four times with an interval of 20 s (“strong” stimulation protocol). To evoke LTP exclusively in mossy fiber synapses, which are known to undergo LTP in an NMDA receptor-independent manner, the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 (50 μm; Tocris, Bristol, UK) was applied 15 min before and during HFS. All recorded mossy fiber responses followed presynaptic stimulation of 100 Hz and showed no changes in the shape of responses after induction of LTP. To additionally confirm that the fEPSPs recorded were evoked by the stimulation of mossy fibers and not by the associational/commissural pathway, an agonist of type II metabotropic glutamate receptors (LCCG1, 10 μm; Tocris), which is known to reduce synaptic transmission in CA3 mossy fiber synapses (34Manzoni O.J. Castillo P.E. Nicoll R.A. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 965-971Google Scholar), was applied at the end of each experiment. Slices in which responses were reduced by at least 70% were selected for analysis. Basal synaptic transmission was monitored at 0.033 Hz. The mean amplitude of fEPSPs recorded 0-10 min before HFS was taken as 100%. Post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) was calculated as the maximal increase in the amplitude of fEPSP after HFS. The values of LTP were calculated as increase in the mean amplitude of fEPSPs measured 50-60 min after HFS. Data acquisition and measurements were performed by using an EPC-9 amplifier and Pulse software (Heka Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz, Germany). Values in electrophysiological experiments are reported as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance using Sigma Plot 5.0 software (Chicago). Nerve Tract Tracing between the Hippocampus and Amygdala—Neuronal tracing was analyzed in eight mice of each genotype by injecting biotinylated dextran amine (BDA, Molecular Probes) into the amygdala. After the mouse was deeply anesthetized with ketamine (1.25 mg/g) and xylazine (0.07 mg/g), BDA (10% in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4; 0.2 μl) was stereotaxically injected into amygdala by using Picospritzer (Parker Instrumentation) and the following coordinates: Anterior, -0.12; Left, -0.27; Dorsal, -0.4 in cm from Bregma (35Franklin K.B.J. Paxinos G. The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). The animals were allowed to recover under close observation and were returned to their cage. Six days after injection, brains were fixed as described above, and cryosections were analyzed immunohisto-chemically using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled Avidin (Vector Laboratories). Metabolic and Behavioral Parameters—Two separate cohorts of 4-month-old male mice were analyzed. The first consisted of 10 wild-type and 9 ST8Sia-II-deficient littermates. These were assessed in a behavioral test battery modified from that used by McIlwain et al. (36McIlwain K.L. Merriweather M.Y. Yuva-Paylor L.A. Paylor R. Physiol. Behav. 2001; 73: 705-717Google Scholar) and as described previously (37Corbo J.C. Deuel T.A. Long J.M. LaPorte P. Tsai E. Wynshaw-Boris A. Walsh C.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7548-7557Google Scholar). This included parameters such as metabolic performance, physical appearance, sensorimotor reflexes, motor activity, nociception, acoustic startle, sensorimotor gating, and assessments of learning and memory. Concern that testing mice in such a large battery could influence behavior in any individual task and that multiple assessments increased the probability of a type I statistical error, a second cohort of mice was also analyzed (wild-type, n = 16; Δ/Δ, n = 15). In the open field test, activity was measured in a 30-min test period in an area of 45 × 45 cm using a Digiscan apparatus (Accuscan Electronics, Columbus, OH). Vertical activity (rearing) and distance (total and center) were recorded. Passive avoidance analysis involved a two-compartment light/dark apparatus (35 × 18 × 30 cm, Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA). Each mouse was placed in the lighted compartment. When the animal entered the dark compartment, a guillotine door closed behind and a foot shock of 0.4 mA was delivered through the grid floor of the dark compartment for 3 s. If the mouse did not enter the dark compartment within 10 min, it was excluded from the retrieval test. In the retrieval trial performed 24 h later, the latency for the mice to enter the dark compartment was recorded. The maximum latency was 600 s. Fear conditioning analyses used chambers (26 × 22 × 18 cm high) made of clear Plexiglas placed in a 2 × 2 array (Med Associates). A video camera was used for recording and analysis (FreezeFrame, Actimetrics, St. Evanston, IL). The conditioned stimulus (CS) was an 85-db, 2,800-Hz, 20-s tone, and the unconditioned stimulus was a scrambled foot shock at 0.75 mA presented during the last 3 s of the CS. Mice were placed in the test chamber for 3 min before recording CS and freezing behavior. Freezing was defined as the absence of movement other than breathing, and thresholds were selected via the software of high correlation with human observers. Three CS/unconditioned stimulus pairings were given with 1-min spacing, and freezing during the CS was also recorded. Each mouse was returned to the shock chamber 24 h later, and freezing responses were recorded for 3 min (context test). The chambers were modified to present a different environmental context (shape, odor, color changes), and 2 h later the mice were placed in this novel environment. Freezing behavior was recorded for 3 min before and during three CS presentations (cued conditioning). The time spent freezing was converted to a percent value. The water maze task constituted a pretraining phase during which all mice from both cohorts were tested for 2 days in a straight-swim pretraining protocol. Mice received 16 trials (8 trials over 2 days) in a 31 × 60-cm rectangular tank that was located in a different room than the circular tank used in the hidden platform trials. The platform was located 1 cm below the water opposite from the start location. Latency to climb onto the platform was the dependent measure. Criteria for advancing to the hidden platform trials was completing 6 of 8 trials under 10 s on the 2nd day. This pretraining procedure provided experience with swimming and climbing onto a submerged platform without exposing the mice to the spatial cues used in the hidden platform trials. This procedure both screens for mice with severe motor deficits and reduces behavioral variability often seen on the 1st day of hidden platform testing. All mice successfully passed this pretraining phase. Hidden platform testing followed in which extra-maze visual cues were hung from a curtain located around a 1.26-m diameter circular tank. The water was made opaque with the addition of non-toxic paint. The 10-cm diameter escape platform was located 1 cm below the surface of the water, and a Polytrack video-tracking system (San Diego Instruments) was used to collect mouse movement data (location, distance, and latency) during training and probe trials. Each mouse was given eight trials a day, in two blocks of four trials for 4 consecutive days. After 36 trials, each animal was given a 60-s probe trial. During the probe test, the platform was removed, and quadrant search times were measured. Visual cue testing was performed 1 day after the last hidden-platform training trial, wherein mice were trained to locate a visiblecued platform. The visible cue was a gray plastic cube (9 cm) attached to a pole so that it was 10 cm above the platform. On each trial of the visible platform test, the platform was randomly located in one of the four quadrants. Mice were given eight trials, in blocks of four trials, and the latency to find the platform was recorded for each trial. Metabolic chambers termed CLAMS (Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) automatically recorded metabolic parameters including volume of carbon dioxide produced (VCO2), volume of oxygen consumed (VO2), respiration (respiratory exchange ratio) = VCO2/VO2, and caloric (heat) value ((3.815 + 1.232 × respiratory exchange ratio) × VO2), motion in all three axes in time, and consumption of food and water. Data were collected every 30 min over three 12-h dark cycles and two 12-h light cycles and analyzed as mean values over each 12-h period with the exception of food and water intake which were added to the total during subsequent cycles. Pulmonary function was scored by measurement of the uptake of CO. A carbon monoxide uptake monitor (Columbus Instruments) measured the CO level in a sealed chamber after exposing the mouse to a 60-s interval of air with 0.17% CO. The mean breath per min was also recorded. Each animal was tested once. Blood pressure was determined by a noninvasive blood pressure tail-cuff system (Columbus Instruments) that measures systolic blood pressure in addition to heart rate and relative changes in diastolic and mean blood pressure. Individual mice were placed in a small cylinder chamber; occlusion and sensor cuffs were placed on the tail, and the tail was warmed to 37 °C. Mice were first acclimated to the restraining chamber, tail cuffs, and the heat fan for 30 min for 2 days prior to testing. The mean of four measurements on the 3rd day was reported and analyzed by the Student's t test. ST8Sia-II Inactivation in the Mouse Germ Line—The ST8Sia-II gene is highly conserved among mammals and includes multiple exons that compose the catalytic domain (21Scheidegger E.P. Sternberg L.R. Roth J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22685-22688Google Scholar). Exon 4 encodes a significant portion of the sialyl motif L, a peptide sequence that is essential for sialyltransferase activity (38Datta A.K. Paulson J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1497-1500Google Scholar). DNA encoding exon 4 of the ST8Sia-II gene was targeted for elimination from the mouse genome (Fig. 1A). Targeted ES cells that bore the exon 4 deletion were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to obtain chimeric mice. The mutant allele was transmitted into the germ line and bred into the C57BL/6 strain (Fig. 1B). Mice homozygous for the deleted ST8Sia-II allele (Δ) were produced by heterozygous parental genotypes at close to Mendelian ratios (wt/wt:wt/Δ:Δ/Δ = 29:50:21%; n = 255). No differences in body weight or brain size were noted despite the fact that highest expression of ST8Sia-II occurs in wild-type embryos at early developmental stages. Inactivation of ST8Sia-II because of deletion of exon 4 was investigated by RNA and enzymatic analyses. RT-PCR revealed that the truncated form of ST8Sia-II mRNA lacking exon 4 was produced in both heterozygous and the ST8Sia-II null mice (Fig. 1C). The mutant ST8Sia-II cDNA was isolated and found unable to produce polysialyltransferase activity (data not shown). RNA analyses by RT-PCR at various post-natal ages further demonstrated that the disruption of ST8Sia-II does not affect the level of ST8Sia-IV mRNA (Fig. 1D). PSA Expression and Neurogenesis—PSA expression was reduced in the olfactory bulb and cerebral cortex of adult ST8Sia-II-deficient mice (Fig. 2). There was no quantitative alteration of PSA among the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum, in contrast to the pattern of PSA deficiency found among mice lacking ST8Sia-IV (29Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Google Scholar). However, closer examination of the hippocampus of ST8Sia-II-deficient mice revealed a PSA deficit in the dentate gyrus. Neurogenesis takes place throughout adulthood in the dentate gyrus, and progenitor cells that migrate into the granule cell layer express high levels of PSA. There is also an association of neuronal precursor cells and PSA expression with other regions supporting neurogenesis in the adult brain, including the subventricular zone. Progenitor cells expressing PSA in the granule layer were greatly reduced and often absent in ST8Sia-II-deficient mice (Fig. 3, A and B). In the subventricular zone, there was no difference in PSA expression in the anterior region; however, PSA expression was reduced among newly"
https://openalex.org/W1980574728,"Nectins are Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that are involved in formation of cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). The nectin-based cell-cell adhesion induces activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, which eventually enhances the formation of AJs through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Although evidence has accumulated that nectins recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites through their cytoplasm-associated proteins, afadin and catenins, it is not fully understood how nectins are physically associated with cadherins. Here we identified a rat counterpart of the human LIM domain only 7 (LMO7) as an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein. Rat LMO7 has two splice variants, LMO7a and LMO7b, consisting of 1,729 and 1,395 amino acids, respectively. LMO7 has calponin homology, PDZ, and LIM domains. Western blotting revealed that LMO7 was expressed ubiquitously in various rat tissues. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that LMO7 localized at cell-cell AJs, where afadin localized, in epithelial cells of rat gallbladder. In addition, LMO7 localized at the cytoplasmic faces of apical membranes in the same epithelial cells. We furthermore revealed that LMO7 bound α-actinin, an actin filament-bundling protein, which bound to α-catenin. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that LMO7 was associated with both the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin systems. LMO7 was assembled at the cell-cell adhesion sites after both the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin systems had been assembled. These results indicate that LMO7 is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein that connects the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin systems through α-actinin.

Cells in multicellular organisms recognize their neighboring cells, adhere to them, and form intercellular junctions. Such junctions have essential roles in various cellular functions, including morphogenesis, differentiation, proliferation, and migration (for reviews, see Refs. 1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar, 2Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Google Scholar, 3Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Google Scholar). In polarized epithelial cells, cell-cell adhesion is mediated through a junctional complex comprised of tight junctions (TJs), 1The abbreviations used are: TJ, tight junction; Ab, antibody; ADIP, afadin dilute domain-interacting protein; AJ, adherens junction; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ES cells, embryonic stem cells; F-actin, actin filament; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; His6, hexahistidine; LMO7, LIM domain only 7; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MBP, maltose-binding protein; pAb, polyclonal antibody. adherens junctions (AJs), and desmosomes (3Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Google Scholar). These junctional structures are typically aligned from the apical to basal sides, although desmosomes are distributed independently in other areas (3Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Google Scholar). AJs were originally defined using ultrastructural analysis as closely apposed plasma membrane domains reinforced by a dense cytoplasmic plaque where actin filament (F-actin) bundles are undercoated (3Perez-Moreno M. Jamora C. Fuchs E. Cell. 2003; 112: 535-548Google Scholar). Molecular analysis shows that AJs are cell-cell adhesion sites where classic cadherins function as cell-cell adhesion molecules and where the actin-based cytoskeleton and several cytoplasmic components are assembled (for reviews, see Refs. 4Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Google Scholar and 5Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Google Scholar). E-cadherin, like other classical cadherins, is a single-pass transmembrane protein whose extracellular domain mediates homophilic recognition and adhesive binding in a Ca2+-dependent manner (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Google Scholar). E-cadherin associates with the actin cytoskeleton through peripheral membrane proteins, including α-, β-, and γ-catenins, α-actinin, and vinculin (4Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Google Scholar, 5Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Google Scholar). β-Catenin interacts directly with the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin and connects E-cadherin to α-catenin, which binds directly to F-actin. α-Actinin and vinculin are also F-actin-binding proteins that bind directly to α-catenin. The association of E-cadherin with the actin cytoskeleton through these peripheral membrane proteins strengthens the cell-cell adhesion activity of E-cadherin (4Nagafuchi A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 600-603Google Scholar, 5Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Google Scholar). We have found that Ca2+-independent immunoglobulin-like cell-cell adhesion molecules, nectins, and their associated F-actin-binding protein, afadin, localize at AJs (for reviews, see Refs. 6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar and 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar). Nectins comprise a family of four members, nectin-1, -2, -3, and -4. All nectins form homo-cis-dimers and then homo-trans-dimers (trans-interactions), causing cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3 furthermore forms hetero-trans-dimers with nectin-1 and -2. Nectin-4 also forms hetero-trans-dimers with nectin-1. Afadin has at least two splice variants, l- and s-afadin (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar). Unless otherwise specified, afadin refers to l-afadin in this paper. Nectins recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion through afadin and catenins, resulting in formation of AJs in epithelial cells and fibroblasts and in formation of synapses in neurons (for reviews, see Refs. 6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar, 8Takai Y. Shimizu K. Ohtsuka T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 520-526Google Scholar). Nectins also recruit first junctional adhesion molecules and then claudins and occludin to the apical side of AJs in cooperation with cadherins, resulting in formation of TJs (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar). Kinetically, nectins increase the velocities of the formation of AJs and TJs. Claudins are key Ca2+-independent cell-cell adhesion molecules at TJs, but the function of occludin has not yet been established (for a review, see Ref. 9Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 4: 285-293Google Scholar). Junctional adhesion molecules are Ca2+-independent Ig-like cell-cell adhesion molecules that recruit the cell polarity protein complex, consisting of Par-3, atypical protein kinase C, and Par-6, by directly binding Par-3 (for a review, see Ref. 10Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Google Scholar). We have demonstrated recently that nectin-1 and -3, but not nectin-2 furthermore play a role in cell polarization by binding Par-3 directly (11Takekuni K. Ikeda W. Fujito T. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Monden M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5497-5500Google Scholar). On the other hand, nectins induce activation of Cdc42 and Rac small G proteins, which regulates cell-cell adhesion through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (for reviews, see Refs. 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar and 12Shimizu K. Takai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 631-636Google Scholar). Rac is also activated by E-cadherin (for a review, see Ref. 13Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Google Scholar). Cdc42 activated by nectins increases the number of filopodia and cell-cell contact sites such as “Fork initiation.” Rac activated by either nectins and/or E-cadherin induces formation of lamellipodia and efficiently zips the cell-cell adhesion between the filopodia such as “Zipper.” The Cdc42 activated by nectins is furthermore involved in the formation of the claudin-based TJs in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (14Fukuhara A. Shimizu K. Kawakatsu T. Fukuhara T. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51885-51893Google Scholar). Non-trans-interacting nectins inhibit the E-cadherin-induced activation of Rac and the subsequent formation of AJs, until the non-trans-interacting nectins trans-interact with other nectins and induce the activation of Cdc42 (15Hoshino T. Shimizu K. Honda T. Kawakatsu T. Fukuyama T. Nakamura T. Matsuda M. Takai Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1077-1088Google Scholar). Although evidence has accumulated that nectins recruit cadherins to the nectin-based cell-cell adhesion sites, resulting in the formation of AJs (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar), it is not fully understood how nectins are physically associated with cadherins. Afadin binds α-catenin directly in vitro, but this binding is not strong (6Takai Y. Nakanishi H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 17-27Google Scholar, 7Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar). The direct binding of these proteins may occur in vivo, but it is more likely that a post-translational modification(s) of either or both proteins and/or an unidentified molecule(s) is required for the binding of α-catenin and afadin. Consistently, we have identified two connector units for nectins and cadherins (16Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Nishioka H. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1001-1017Google Scholar, 17Asada M. Irie K. Morimoto K. Yamada A. Ikeda W. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4103-4111Google Scholar). One is a ponsin-vinculin unit. Ponsin is an afadin- and vinculin-binding protein, and vinculin is an F-actin- and α-catenin-binding protein. The other is an afadin dilute domain-interacting protein (ADIP)-α-actinin unit. ADIP is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein, and α-actinin is an α-catenin-binding protein. However, we have not obtained direct evidence that the nectin-afadin system is associated with the cadherin-catenin systems in vivo through these two connector units. Therefore, there may be another connector unit for nectins and cadherins. It also remains unknown which protein(s) is the downstream target(s) of Cdc42 and Rac activated by nectins during the formation of AJs and TJs. To obtain the molecule(s) that acts as a connector for nectins and cadherins, or which functions in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion by Cdc42 and Rac, we attempted here to identify an afadin-binding protein using yeast two-hybrid screening. We identified a rat counterpart of human LIM domain only 7 (LMO7) as an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein. Human LMO7 was first reported to be a human cDNA containing a tissue-specific alternative spliced LIM domain (18Putilina T. Jaworski C. Gentleman S. McDonald B. Kadiri M. Wong P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 433-439Google Scholar). Human and mouse LMO7 are candidate genes for the breast cancer development in human chromosomal region 13q21-q22 and for the embryonic lethality in the mouse Ednrbs-1Acrg deletion, respectively (19Rozenblum E. Vahteristo P. Sandberg T. Bergthorsson J.T. Syrjakoski K. Weaver D. Haraldsson K. Johannsdottir H.K. Vehmanen P. Nigam S. Golberger N. Robbins C. Pak E. Dutra A. Gillander E. Stephan D.A. Bailey-Wilson J. Juo S.H. Kainu T. Arason A. Barkardottir R.B. Nevanlinna H. Borg A. Kallioniemi O.P. Hum. Genet. 2002; 110: 111-121Google Scholar, 20Kurihara L.J. Semenova E. Miller W. Ingram R.S.

However, no functional analysis of LMO7 protein has been performed. Here we have shown that LMO7 is an afadin- and α-actinin-binding protein that connects the nectin-afadin and E-cadherin-catenin systems through α-actinin. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—One bait vector, pGBD-nectin-2-cytoplasmic domain (CP) (amino acids 387–467), was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the amino acid residue of nectin-2α into pGBD-C1 (22James P. Hallady J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar). The yeast expression plasmids expressing l-afadin (amino acids 1–1829) and s-afadin (amino acids 1–1663) were constructed with the pADHU-Myc vector, which was designed to express an N-terminal Myc-tagged protein. Another bait vector, pGBD-LMO7-PDZ (amino acids 1030–1052), was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the amino acids residue of LMO7a into pGBD-C1. Yeast two-hybrid libraries constructed from rat brain and rat lung cDNAs were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATa trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2::GAL7-lacZ) harboring pGBD-nectin-2-CP and pADHU-Myc-l-afadin was transformed with the rat brain and rat lung cDNAs libraries. 16 and 16 positive clones were obtained from 4 × 105 clones of a rat lung library and 5 × 105 clones of a rat brain library, respectively. Two-hybrid analysis revealed that the proteins encoded by these 32 clones bound to afadin, but not to nectin-2-CP (see Fig. 1A and data not shown). Standard procedures for yeast manipulations were as described previously (23Kaiser C.A. Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Methods in Yeast Genetics, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors—Full-length cDNAs of LMO7a and LMO7b were obtained from a rat heart Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) by PCR. The obtained full-length cDNAs encoded two splice variants of rat LMO7, LMO7a (GenBank™ accession number AY533473) and LMO7b (GenBank™ accession number AY533474), consisting of 1,729 and 1,395 amino acids, respectively. The mammalian expression vectors pCMV-FLAG, pCMV-HA, and pCMV-Myc were used to express N-terminal FLAG-, hemagglutinin (HA)-, and Myc-tagged proteins, respectively (24Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) was used to express an N-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP)-tagged protein. The mammalian expression vector expressing afadin (amino acids 1–1829) was constructed with pCMV-Myc. The mammalian expression vectors expressing LMO7a and LMO7b, pCMV-FLAG-LMO7a (amino acids 1–1729), pCMV-FLAG-LMO7b (amino acids 1–1395), pCMV-FLAG-LMO7-C (1318–1729), pEGFP-LMO7a (1–1729), and pEGFP-LMO7b (1–1395) were constructed with pCMV-FLAG and pEGFP-C1. The mammalian expression vector expressing α-actinin-1 (GenBank™ accession number BC015766), pCMV-HA-α-actinin-1-C (amino acids 406–892), was constructed with pCMV-HA. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion or maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion vectors of LMO7, MBP-LMO7-C1 (amino acids 1320–1412), MBP-LMO7-C2 (1573–1723), GST-LMO7-C1 (1320–1412), GST-LMO7-C2 (1573–1723), and GST-LMO7-C3 (1540–1729) were constructed with pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMal-C2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The GST and MBP fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs), respectively. pFastBac1-Myc-His6-afadin was designed to express a C-terminal Myc- and His6 (hexahistidine)-tagged afadin (Myc-His6-afadin; amino acids 1–1829). The Myc-His6-afadin was expressed in High Five insect cells (Invitrogen) and purified by the use of TALON metal affinity beads (Clontech) as described previously (25Tachibana K. Nakanishi H. Mandai K. Ozaki K. Ikeda W. Yamamoto Y. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1161-1176Google Scholar). Antibodies—GST-LMO7-C1 (amino acids 1320–1412) and GST-LMO7-C2 (1573–1723) were used as each antigen to raise polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) in rabbits. Two pAbs against LMO7-C1 (amino acids 1320–1412) and LMO7-C2 (1573–1723), N02 and C05, were used after affinity purification with MBP-LMO7-C1 (amino acids 1320–1412) and MBP-LMO7-C2 (1573–1723), respectively. A mouse anti-afadin monoclonal Ab (mAb) was prepared as described previously (26Sakisaka T. Nakanishi H. Takahashi K. Mandai K. Miyahara M. Satoh A. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1609-1617Google Scholar). A rat anti-ZO-1 mAb was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). A mouse anti-E-cadherin mAb and a rabbit anti-β-catenin pAb were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). A mouse anti-FLAG-M2 mAb and a rabbit anti-α-catenin pAb were purchased from Sigma. A rat anti-HA mAb was purchased from BabCO (Richmond, CA). A rabbit anti-α-actinin pAb and a mouse anti-Myc mAb were purchased from Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture and Transfection—MTD-1A cells were kindly supplied by Dr. S. Tsukita (Kyoto University). MTD-1A and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Afadin–/– ES cells were generated as described previously (27Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1117-1132Google Scholar). Wild-type and afadin–/– ES cells were cultured without feeder cells on gelatin-coated 10-cm dishes for 2 days in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 3 mm adenosine, 3 mm cysteine, 3 mm guanosine, 3 mm uridine, and 1 mm thymidine (27Ikeda W. Nakanishi H. Miyoshi J. Mandai K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka M. Togawa A. Takahashi K. Nishioka H. Yoshida H. Mizoguchi A. Nishikawa S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1117-1132Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were transfected using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (Clontech). MTD-1A cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Assay for Coimmunoprecipitation of LMO7 with Afadin and α-Actinin—Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using HEK293 cells were done as follows. HEK293 cells were transfected with the expression plasmids in various combinations. The cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell extract (1.2 mg of protein) was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The cell extract was incubated with 4 μl of the anti-FLAG M2 mAb-coated protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 18 h. After the beads were washed with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in an SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-FLAG, anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-afadin, and anti-α-actinin Abs. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments using MTD-1A cells and wild-type and afadin–/– ES cells were done as follows. MTD-1A cells, wild-type ES cells, and afadin–/– ES cells on two 10-cm dishes were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A, followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The cell extract was incubated with 20 μl of the anti-LMO7 pAb (N02)-coated protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 18 h. After the beads were washed with buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the SDS sample buffer for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-LMO7, anti-afadin, anti-α-actinin, anti-E-cadherin, anti-α-catenin, and anti-β-catenin Abs. Assay for the Binding of LMO7 to Afadin—To examine the interaction of LMO7 with Myc-His6-afadin (12.5 pmol of protein fixed on 5.7 μl of beads) was immobilized on the anti-Myc mAb-coupled beads prepared by cross-linking of the anti-Myc mAb with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) via dimethylpimelimidate (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). GST-LMO7-C3 (amino acids 1540–1729; 252 pmol of protein) was applied to the Myc-His6-afadin-immobilized beads equilibrated with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 12 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GTPγS). After the beads were washed extensively with buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gel), followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Other Methods—Subcellular fractionation of rat liver was performed as described (29Kawabe H. Nakanishi H. Asada M. Fukuhara A. Morimoto K. Takeuchi M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (34Laemmuli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Google Scholar). Identification of an Afadin-binding Protein—To identify an afadin-binding protein, we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length afadin bound to the cytoplasmic domain of nectin-2 as a bait (Fig. 1A). We screened 4 × 105 clones of a rat lung library and 5 × 105 clones of a rat brain library and obtained 16 and 16 positive clones, respectively. Seven clones encoded proteins highly similar to the C-terminal portion of human LMO7 (GenBank™ accession number AF33045). Rat full-length clones of LMO7 were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. Two splice variants were isolated, and they encoded proteins composed of 1,729 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 195,568 and 1,395 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 156,646, respectively (Fig. 1B). We named these rat counterparts of human LMO7, LMO7a and LMO7b. Both LMO7a and LMO7b have calponin homology (amino acids 17–129 in LMO7a and LMO7b), PDZ (amino acids 1076–1152 in LMO7a; 742–818 in LMO7b), and LIM (amino acids 1659–1723 in LMO7a; 1325–1389 in LMO7b) domains (Fig. 1B). LMO7a also has an F-box (amino acids 549–590), which is shown to be critical for degradation of cellular regulatory proteins (35Cenciarelli C. Chiaur D.S. Guardavaccaro D. Parks W. Vidal M. Pagano M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1177-1179Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The amino acids sequences of human LMO7 and rat LMO7b were 75% identical to each other. To confirm whether the isolated cDNAs encode full-length LMO7a and LMO7b, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-FLAG-LMO7a and pCMV-FLAG-LMO7b, which expressed the FLAG-tagged full-length proteins of LMO7a and LMO7b, respectively. The cell extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with the anti-LMO7 pAbs. Two anti-LMO7 pAbs, N02 against the central portion of LMO7a (amino acids 1320–1412) and C05 against the C-terminal portion of LMO7a (amino acids 1659–1723), were generated. Proteins with a molecular mass of about 220 and 200 kDa were detected in the extracts of HEK293 cells expressing pCMV-FLAG-LMO7a and pCMV-FLAG-LMO7b, respectively, by these two pAbs (Fig. 1C and data not shown). The band of exogenously expressed FLAG-LMO7b was slightly higher than that of endogenous LMO7 in rat liver. This difference is probably because of the molecular mass of FLAG tag. Thus, the isolated cDNAs encode full-length LMO7a and LMO7b. In Vitro and in Vivo Binding of LMO7 to Afadin—Two-hybrid analysis revealed that LMO7 specifically bound to l-afadin, but not to s-afadin (Fig. 1A). The region containing the LIM domain (amino acids 1659–1723) of LMO7 was required for the binding to afadin (Fig. 1B). To confirm the binding of LMO7 to afadin in intact cells, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with the Myc-tagged full-length of afadin (Myc-afadin) and the FLAG-tagged C-terminal portion of LMO7 containing the LIM domain (FLAG-LMO7-C; amino acids 1318–1729), which was isolated in the two-hybrid screening. When FLAG-LMO7-C was immunoprecipitated from the cell extract with the anti-FLAG mAb, Myc-afadin was coimmunoprecipitated as detected by Western blotting with the anti-Myc mAb (Fig. 2A). When FLAG-LMO7-C was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG mAb from the extract of HEK293 cells transiently expressing FLAG-LMO7-C alone, endogenous afadin was coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2B). We next examined whether endogenous afadin was coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous LMO7 from the extract of MTD-1A cells. MTD-1A cells expressed two isoforms of LMO7, which were detected by two anti-LMO7 pAbs (Fig. 1C and data not shown). When the two isoforms of endogenous LMO7 were immunoprecipitated from the extract of MTD-1A cells with anti-LMO7 pAb, endogenous afadin was coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2C). Afadin was not coimmunoprecipitated with control IgG. Finally, we examined whether LMO7 interacted directly with afadin. A GST fusion protein of the region containing the LIM domain (GST-LMO7-C3; amino acids 1540–1729) stoichiometrically bound to the Myc- and His6-tagged protein of afadin (Myc-His6-afadin) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads through the anti-Myc mAb (Fig. 2D). These results together with the two-hybrid analysis indicate that LMO7 binds directly to afadin both in vitro and in vivo. Tissue and Subcellular Distribution of LMO7—Western blotting with the anti-LMO7 pAb detected ∼180-kDa protein in rat heart, lung, kidney, and small intestine (Fig. 3A lanes 2, 3, 5, and 7). The larger and smaller bands (∼210 and ∼115 kDa in brain, ∼200 kDa in kidney) were detected, suggesting that the larger and smaller splice variants of LMO7 may be expressed (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 5). After long exposure, the immunoreactive band of LMO7 was detected in other tissues including liver, spleen, testis, and skeletal muscle (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation analysis of LMO7 in rat liver indicated that it was enriched in the fraction rich in AJs and TJs, where afadin was also enriched (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5). The reason why the Western blotting of tissue distribution with short exposure did not detect ∼180-kDa protein in the liver (Fig. 3A, lane 4) was probably because of its low expression level. These results indicate that LMO7 is expressed widely, although its expression levels vary depending on tissues.

Fish that live in the polar oceans survive at low temperatures by virtue of ‘antifreeze’ plasma proteins1 in the blood that bind to ice crystals and prevent these from growing. However, the antifreeze proteins isolated so far from the winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus), a common fish in the Northern Hemisphere, are not sufficiently active to protect it from freezing in icy sea water. Here we describe a previously undiscovered antifreeze protein from this flounder that is extremely active (as effective as those found in insects) and which explains the resistance of this fish to freezing in polar and subpolar waters."

We have shown recently that Ox-PAPC-mediated induction of IL-8 transcription is independent of NF-κB activation, a major transcription factor utilized by cytokines and lipopolysaccharide for the induction of IL-8 transcription. In this study, we provide evidence for the role of c-src in Ox-PAPC and, specifically, PEIPC-mediated IL-8 induction. Ox-PAPC and its component phospholipids induced a rapid and transient phosphorylation of c-src Tyr418, a hallmark of c-src activation, in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Ox-PAPC-mediated IL-8 protein synthesis in HAEC was inhibited by Src family kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, but not by an inactive analog, PP3. Transient expression of plasmids containing C-terminal Src kinase or kinase-deficient dominant-negative c-src resulted in a 72 and 50% reduction in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 promoter activation in human microvascular endothelial cells, respectively. In contrast, overexpression of v-src kinase resulted in a 4-fold increase in IL-8 promoter activation, without inducing NF-κB promoter activation. Furthermore, treatment of HAEC with Ox-PAPC and its component PEIPC induced the activation of STAT3 by phosphorylating Tyr705, a feature of STAT3 activation. STAT3 is a known downstream effector of c-src. Ox-PAPC-induced activation of STAT3 resulted in the translocation of STAT3 from the cytoplasm of HAEC into their nuclear compartment. Transient expression of a dominant-negative STAT3β construct in HMEC strongly inhibited IL-8 induction by Ox-PAPC. Taken together, these data demonstrate the role of the c-src kinase/STAT3 pathway in Ox-PAPC-mediated IL-8 expression in endothelial cells.

We have identified three bioactive phospholipid components of Ox-PAPC, i.e. 1-palmitoyl-2-epoxyisoprostane-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PEIPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (POVPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (PGPC) (2Subbanagounder G.

Although structurally quite similar, these oxidized phospholipids differ in their biological activities (5Berliner J.A. Subbanagounder G. Leitinger N. Watson A.D. Vora D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The proinflammatory effect of Ox-PAPC and its component phospholipids is attributed to their ability to enhance monocyte binding to endothelial cells (EC) and to stimulate synthesis of chemotactic factors that activate monocytes. Ox-PAPC increases monocyte binding to EC by activating β1-integrins on the surface of EC by means of an inside-out signaling mechanism, mediated through R-Ras activation and elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels (3Cole A.L. Subbanagounder G. Mukhopadhyay S. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1384-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This activated integrin binds CS-1/fibronectin, which in turn, interacts with monocyte-specific integrins (6Shih P.T. Elices M.J. Fang Z.T. Ugarova T.P. Strahl D. Territo M.C. Frank J.S. Kovach N.L. Cabanas C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We have evidence that PEIPC is the most bioactive phospholipid contributing to the increase in monocyte binding and intracellular cAMP induced by Ox-PAPC in endothelial cells and other Ox-PAPC-responsive cell types (3Cole A.L. Subbanagounder G. Mukhopadhyay S. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1384-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ox-PAPC also activates EC to increase transcription of chemokines, such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (7Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which promote monocyte adhesion to activated EC. The signaling mechanism mediating Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription, however, remains to be elucidated. Recently, we have demonstrated that Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription differs from traditional lipopolysaccharide and cytokine-induced IL-8 transcription. Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis is more sustained than that described for lipopolysaccharide and cytokines and is also independent of NF-κB and AP-1, transcription factors regulating the IL-8 promoter by lipopolysaccharide and cytokines (8Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N. Matsushima K. Vora D.K. Berliner J.A. Reddy S.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1585-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 synthesis is mediated through a novel, alternative signal transduction pathway. To identify the signaling pathway leading to Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription, we previously examined the role of PPARα in chemokine induction in both mouse and human EC (7Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Ox-PAPC activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α in murine aortic EC and fails to induce monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 protein synthesis in PPARα-null murine endothelial cells, suggesting that PPARα is involved in Ox-PAPC signaling of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 synthesis in mouse aortic endothelial cells (7Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Because Ox-PAPC, and specifically PEIPC, activate PPARα in human EC, we proposed a role for PPARα in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. However, a role for PPARα in Ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 transcription in human EC could not be consistently demonstrated. The current study demonstrates an important role for c-Src kinase as the initial activator of IL-8 induction by Ox-PAPC treatment in human EC. Src kinases participate in growth factor/cytokine signal transduction pathways that mediate proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis (10Schwartzberg P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific expression and alternative splicing yields at least 14 different Src-related kinases. Three family members (c-src, c-fyn, and c-yes) are expressed in EC and, on the basis of studies with transgenic mice, seem to have partially overlapping functions. Src family kinases have been known to play important roles in many cellular processes and pathological conditions, including chemokine induction (11Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). For instance, thrombin-induced 9E3/CEF4 (avian chemokine homologue to human IL-8) and urateinduced IL-8 synthesis in fibroblasts require c-src kinase activity (12Vaingankar S.M. Martins-Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5226-5234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Liu R. Aupperle K. Terkeltaub R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 961-968PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of c-src activity is mediated through phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues. Phosphorylation of Tyr529 by C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) inhibits c-src activity, whereas dephosphorylation of this residue seems to be an activating mechanism. Autophosphorylation of Tyr418 in the catalytic domain is also an activating signal. The phosphorylation state of c-src regulates the intramolecular interactions between the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain and the SH2 and SH3 domains. Phosphorylation of Tyr418 and/or dephosphorylation of Tyr529 induce conformational changes in c-src, which promote its interaction with other regulators and downstream effectors. Among the downstream effectors of Src kinases are the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) (14Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To date, six mammalian genes have been identified in this family of transcription factors. Alternative splicing and post-translational proteolytic cleavage has been shown to generate additional forms of several STAT members (15Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). c-src has been shown to activate STAT1 (16Cirri P. Chiarugi P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), STAT3 (17Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6643-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). STAT transcription factors play key roles in diverse physiologic processes, from proliferation and differentiation to growth arrest and apoptosis (14Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 20Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4912) Google Scholar). Activation of Src kinases can lead to the activation of STAT proteins, which is reflected by phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and serine residues. The phosphorylated STAT proteins, in turn, undergo homo/hetero-dimerization and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind specific promoter response elements and direct transcription of specific genes. A role for STAT has been demonstrated in the synthesis of several cytokines, but not IL-8. In the current study, we provide evidence that the STAT3 signal transduction pathway mediates IL-8 induction by Ox-PAPC and, specifically, its component PEIPC in human EC. We also demonstrate that c-src activation by Ox-PAPC is independent of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway utilized by Ox-PAPC (POVPC) in activating β1-integrins for monocyte binding.

Whole-cell Lysate Preparation—Confluent endothelial cells (HAEC or HMEC) were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described previously (9Walton K.A. Cole A.L. Yeh M. Subbanagounder G. Krutzik S.R. Modlin R.L. Lucas R.M. Nakai J.

After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant (cell lysate) was collected. Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Lysate Preparation—Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modified method of Dignam et al. (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells were harvested in ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 0.1 ml of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. After 10 min on ice, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and stored as cytoplasmic extract at —20 °C. Subsequently, 0.04 ml of buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 4.2 m NaCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails was added to the pellet. After 15 min on ice, the resuspended pellets were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and stored as nuclear extract at —20 °C. Plasmids—Luciferase reporter plasmids containing human IL-8 promoter (pIL-8-Luc, —1481 to +44 bp) were obtained from Dr. K. Matsushima at the University of Tokyo, Japan. Dominant-negative c-src (DN-src) plasmids, a kinase deficient c-src, were obtained from Dr. John Shyy at University of California, Riverside. Constitutively active Src plasmids, v-src, were provided by Dr. S. Reddy at University of California, Los Angeles (22Herschman H.R. Reddy S.T. Xie W. Adv. Exp. Med.

Luciferase reporter plasmids containing three copies of the NF-κB-binding sites from the human IL-8 promoter were obtained from Drs. R. de Martin and N. Leitinger at the University of Vienna, Austria (25Hofer-Warbinek R. Schmid J.A. Stehlik C. Binder B.R. Lipp J. de Martin R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22064-22068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection—HMEC were plated in 48-well culture dishes (2.0 × 106 cells/plate) in MCDB131 containing 10% FBS. After forty-eight hours, with cells at 90% confluency, transfections were performed in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) with 0.125 μg of total DNA (0.05 μg pIL8-Luc, 0.05 μg phRL-Renilla, and 0.025 μg of either empty vector or dominant-negatives) per well and Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen) at 1:5. Four hours after transfection, wells were aspirated and replaced with full media (MCDB131 containing 10% FBS) for an additional twenty-four hours. Cells were then stimulated with Ox-PAPC for 16 h and analyzed using a Luciferase assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to control vector, phRL-Renilla (Promega). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IL-8 levels in HAEC supernatants were measured with an IL-8 ELISA kit (Quantikine, R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Western Blotting, Assessment of Tyrosine Phosphorylation—For studies on tyrosine phosphorylation, cell lysates (aliquots of 20–30 μg of protein) were prepared and analyzed by Western analysis. After boiling for 5 min in β-mercaptoethanol-containing Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), the samples were separated on 4–12% Tris-glycine SDS gels (Gradipore) for 3 h at 50 mV. The gel was then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membranes for 2 h at 200 mA. Indicated antibodies were applied to the membrane. ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used as the substrate for X-Omat AR film (Kodak) exposure. Ox-PAPC and Its Component Phospholipids (PEIPC and POVPC) Induce Tyrosine Phosphorylation of c-src at Tyr418— Activation of c-src kinase correlates with the phosphorylation state of two tyrosine residues, Tyr418 and Tyr529 (26Martin G.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC alters c-src kinase activity, phosphorylation of c-src at Tyr418 and Tyr529 was examined at various time points after Ox-PAPC treatment. Phosphospecific c-src antibodies detected an increase in Tyr418 phosphorylation within 30 s after Ox-PAPC treatment (Fig. 1A, top panel). Tyr418 phosphorylation peaked at 2 min with Ox-PAPC treatment and returned to control (PAPC) levels within 5 min (Fig. 1A, top panel). Ox-PAPC treatment, however, did not induce a significant decrease in phosphorylation at Tyr529 (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Ox-PAPC treatment also did not change the total amount of c-src, as measured by pan-Src antibody at any time point (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). We examined the relative ability of the three bioactive component phospholipids, PEIPC, POVPC, and PGPC, to induce IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 1B) and promote c-src phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). PEIPC was clearly the most active phospholipid, inducing a 5-fold increase in IL-8 protein levels at 1 μg/ml. PEIPC was also the most active in promoting c-src Tyr418 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C); POVPC induced phosphorylation of Tyr418 to a lesser degree, whereas PGPC was minimally active (Fig. 1C). These results demonstrate that Ox-PAPC and its active components, PEIPC and POVPC, rapidly activate c-src kinase in HAEC by phosphorylating Tyr418. Src Family Kinase Inhibition Decreases Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 Expression—To test the hypothesis that Src family kinases play a role in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 expression, we first employed Src family kinase-specific inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, as well as their inactive analogue, PP3. In HAEC pre-treated with the Src kinase inhibitors for 30 min, PP1 and PP2, but not PP3, significantly reduced Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 protein synthesis (Fig. 2A). Pre-treatment of HAEC with PP2 also significantly inhibited PEIPC-induced IL-8 synthesis (Fig. 2B). Like the chemical inhibitors, Csk also negatively regulates the activity of the Src kinase family (13Liu R. Aupperle K. Terkeltaub R. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2001; 70: 961-968PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this endogenous Src inhibitor negatively regulates IL-8 induction by Ox-PAPC, we co-transfected the Csk expression plasmid with the luciferase reporter construct containing the human IL-8 promoter (pIL-8-Luc) into HMEC. Overexpression of Csk resulted in a significant reduction in Ox-PAPC-induced pIL-8-Luc activation (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the induction of IL-8 protein synthesis by Ox-PAPC and PEIPC treatment in human endothelial cells is mediated through Src family kinases. Identification of c-src as the Src Family Kinase Member Regulating IL-8 Induction by Ox-PAPC—PP1, PP2, and Csk nonselectively block the activity of many members of the Src family of kinases. Because c-src is highly expressed in endothelial cells (11Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), we examined the role of c-src in mediating Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis by employing dominant-negative kinase-deficient c-src mutant plasmids. In HMEC transfected with DN-Src, IL-8 protein synthesis induced by Ox-PAPC treatment was significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in HMEC co-transfected with pIL-8-Luc and DN-Src, IL-8 promoter activation induced by Ox-PAPC treatment was significantly reduced (Fig. 3B). Because the level of reduction in IL-8 promoter activation is similar between DN-Src and nonspecific Src kinase inhibitors, our data suggests that c-src is the major Src kinase family member mediating Ox-PAPC induction of IL-8 protein synthesis. To address whether Src kinase activation is sufficient for inducing IL-8 synthesis in human endothelial cells, we cotransfected HMEC with the constitutively active v-src expression construct (0.025 μg/well). Co-transfection of HMEC with v-Src and p-IL-8-Luc caused a 4-fold increase in pIL-8-Luc activation, compared with cells transfected with p-IL-8-Luc and empty vector (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, at this concentration (0.025 μg/well), v-src overexpression did not activate the NF-κBx3-Luc reporter (Fig. 3C), indicating that increased Src kinase activity can activate the IL-8 promoter, independently of NF-κB activation. Identification of STAT3 as a Downstream Effector of Ox-PAPC-induced c-src Activation—c-src is known to activate many transcription factors, including NF-κB, c-Myc, Ets-1, and STAT 1, 3, and 5 in different biological processes (14Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 3334-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To determine whether STAT proteins play a role in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis in endothelial cells, we first examined the ability of Ox-PAPC to increase phosphorylation of STAT proteins. Using phosphospecific antibodies to the STAT family, we found that Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC significantly induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 (Fig. 4A), but did not induce phosphorylation of STAT 1, 5, or 6 (data not shown). Ox-PAPC-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in the HAEC cytoplasmic compartment was observed as early as 5 min and was sustained for up to 1 h (Fig. 4A, top panel). The total amount of STAT3 also decreased in the cytoplasmic extract after treatment with Ox-PAPC at each time point (Fig. 4A, middle panel). Because phosphorylation of STAT proteins in the cytoplasm leads to their dimerization and movement into the nucleus, we isolated nuclear extracts from Ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC caused the translocation of STAT3 into the nuclear compartment within 5 min and was sustained for up to 1 h (Fig. 4B). We also examined whether PEIPC treatment of HAEC would also activate STAT3 nuclear translocation. PEIPC treatment of HAEC induced STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation at 5 min and 1 h as well (Fig. 4C). To demonstrate the importance of STAT3 activation in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 transcription, we overexpressed a dominant-negative STAT3 (STAT3β) construct in HMEC. Overexpression of the STAT3β construct resulted in a 50% reduction in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 promoter luciferase activation, as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4D). In the present study, we have identified c-src tyrosine kinase as a major signaling molecule for the induction of IL-8 protein synthesis by Ox-PAPC and its bioactive phospholipid components in human endothelial cells. We have demonstrated that a known downstream effector of c-src kinase, STAT3, is also activated by Ox-PAPC treatment and that STAT3 activation plays an important role in Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. Our data suggests a role for endothelial Src family kinases in atherogenesis. It has been reported that Src family kinase activity increases in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-enriched domains isolated from oxidized LDL-treated human EC (27Myers S.J. Stanley K.K. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 143: 389-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Shear stress has been demonstrated to modulate atherogenesis via its effect upon mechano-transducers, which cause c-src activation in EC (28Traub O. Berk B.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II has been reported to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ, an Src substrate (29Masamune A. Kikuta K. Satoh M. Satoh A. Shimosegawa T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, angiotensin II was found to stimulate a 2- to 3-fold increase in the activity of c-src within 2 min (29Masamune A. Kikuta K. Satoh M. Satoh A. Shimosegawa T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), similar to our observation regarding the rapid activation of c-src by Ox-PAPC treatment (Fig. 1A). These findings suggest that activation of Src family kinases in endothelial cells by pro-atherogenic molecules, such as angiotensin II or Ox-PAPC, is an important early signaling event. It may seem paradoxical that oxidized phospholipids increase IL-8 protein synthesis in endothelial cells through c-src independently of NF-κB, whereas others have shown that persistent Src activation promotes NF-κB activation (30Funakoshi-Tago M. Tago K. Sonoda Y. Tominaga S. Kasahara T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1257-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Eicher D.M. Tan T.H. Rice N.R. O'Shea J.J. Kennedy I.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2710-2719PubMed Google Scholar). Our data, however, indicate that a low level of v-src overexpression does not activate NF-κB but increases IL-8 promoter activation significantly (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, overexpression of a high level (1 μg/well) of v-src activates both the IL-8 and NF-κBx3 reporter constructs (data not shown). Similarly, Fig. 1A demonstrated that Ox-PAPC does not induce persistent c-src activation in human endothelial cells, but rather is transiently turned off by 5 min. Taken together, these data suggest that a transient and low level of c-src activation is sufficient to increase IL-8 protein synthesis in human endothelial cells independently of NF-κB. c-src activates several downstream effectors including c-Myc, Ets-1, NF-κB, as well as STAT family members 1, 3, and 5 (11Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). With the exception of STAT proteins, all of these transcription factors have been associated with up-regulation of IL-8 in various conditions and cell types (8Yeh M. Leitinger N. de Martin R. Onai N.

Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2001; 108: 832-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We have provided evidence that a known downstream effector of c-src kinase, STAT3, is activated by Ox-PAPC treatment in human endothelial cells. Ox-PAPC treatment of HAEC induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 4A), as well as translocation of STAT3 into the nuclear compartment (Fig. 4B). The level of phosphorylation of STAT 1, 5, or 6 in HAEC, however, remained unchanged with Ox-PAPC treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, transfection of HMEC with the dominant-negative STAT3β inhibited OxPAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. STAT3 has been previously demonstrated to play a role in inflammation induced by various stimuli, particularly IL-6 and interferon-γ (35Velichko S. Wagner T.C. Turkson J. Jove R. Croze E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35635-35641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36Catlett-Falcone R. Landowski T.H. Oshiro M.M. Turkson J. Levitzki A. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Moscinski L. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. Dalton W.S. Jove R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). STAT3 has also been reported as a “proatherogenic” signaling molecule, because Ox-LDL has been demonstrated to increase its activation (37Maziere C. Alimardani G. Dantin F. Dubois F. Conte M.A. Maziere J.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ox-LDL activation of STAT3, however, seems to occur by a separate pathway than that seen with Ox-PAPC because it requires NF-κB activation. Although STAT regulation of IL-8 protein synthesis has not been described previously, we have recently identified a nucleotide sequence in the upstream region of the human IL-8 promoter between —430 to —438 bp, which is identical to the GAS consensus sequence, demonstrated to bind STAT3 in other promoters. In this paper, we have also identified the most active phospholipid component of Ox-PAPC responsible for IL-8 induction and c-src/STAT3 activation. We report that the highest levels of IL-8 induction and c-src activation were seen with PEIPC, and, to a lesser degree, with POVPC. PGPC had no significant effect upon c-src activation and has been reported recently to signal by means of an alternative pathway to that of PEIPC and POVPC (38Bochkov V.N. Mechtcheriakova D. Lucerna M. Huber J. Malli R. Graier W.F. Hofer E. Binder B.R. Leitinger N. Blood. 2002; 99: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In a recent paper (3Cole A.L. Subbanagounder G. Mukhopadhyay S. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1384-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that Ox-PAPC and its component phospholipids induce monocyte-endothelial cell binding by activating β1-integrins through a cAMP/R-Ras-mediated pathway. Because c-src has been reported to be a downstream effector of G protein coupled receptors, we examined the potential cross-talk between these pathways in IL-8 induction by Ox-PAPC treatment. Our results provide evidence that the activation of c-src by Ox-PAPC treatment in HAEC is independent of cAMP/PKA. Pretreatment of HAEC with RP-cAMP, a cAMP inhibitor, did not inhibit Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 protein synthesis (data not shown), nor did it inhibit Ox-PAPC-induced c-src activation (data not shown). These data demonstrate that although cAMP levels are elevated by Ox-PAPC treatment in HAEC, cAMP does not mediate Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis. We have recently identified Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 as a candidate receptor for the Ox-PAPC-induced IL-8 synthesis pathway (39Walton K.A. Hsieh X. Gharavi N. Wang S. Wang G. Yeh M. Cole A.L. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29661-29666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Certain polymorphisms of TLR have been associated with atherogenesis in humans (40Kiechl S. Lorenz E. Reindl M. Wiedermann C.J. Oberhollenzer F. Bonora E. Willeit J. Schwartz D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar) and C3H mice, which, lacking TLR4, are resistant to atherogenesis (41Vink A. Schoneveld A.H. van der Meer J.J. van Middelaar B.J. Sluijter J.P. Smeets M.B. Quax P.H. Lim S.K. Borst C. Pasterkamp G. de Kleijn D.P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 1985-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A relationship between c-src and TLR has recently been implicated; inhibition of c-src activity by PP2 resulted in a significant decrease in the phosphorylation of the downstream effector of TLR4 (42Hazeki K. Masuda N. Funami K. Sukenobu N. Matsumoto M. Akira S. Takeda K. Seya T. Hazeki O. Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 43Yazawa N. Fujimoto M. Sato S.

These findings suggest that c-src may be activated by Ox-PAPC or its phospholipid components downstream of TLR4. Thus, based upon our former studies regarding the cAMP/R-Ras pathway in β1-integrin activation and our current data regarding the c-src/STAT3 pathway in IL-8 synthesis, we hypothesize two distinct pathways by which Ox-PAPC activates monocyte-endothelial cell interaction (Fig. 5). For IL-8 transcription in endothelial cells, Ox-PAPC, and specifically PEIPC, binds to the TLR4 complex, which transduces a rapid and transient increase of c-src kinase activity. Activated c-src induces phosphorylation and activation of STAT3, which dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, binding the potential GAS element in the IL-8 promoter and increasing IL-8 transcription (Fig. 5). For β1-integrin activation, on the other hand, the oxidized phospholipids act through an unidentified G protein-coupled receptor to increase the level of intracellular cAMP, activating R-Ras, which mediates inside-out β1-integrin activation. This Ox-PAPC-induced integrin activation, in turn, increases the deposition of CS-1 fibronectin (an alternatively spliced fibronectin) on the cell surface, which enhances monocyte binding to endothelial cells. We and others (4Subbanagounder G. Wong J.W. Lee H. Faull K.F. Miller E. Witztum J.L. Berliner J.A. J. Biol.

The current data suggest a candidate signaling mechanism by which phospholipid oxidation products may contribute to the development of NF-κB-independent chronic inflammation, as seen in psoriasis (44Debets R. Timans J.C. Homey B. Zurawski S. Sana T.R. Lo S. Wagner J. Edwards G. Clifford T. Menon S. Bazan J.F. Kastelein R.A. J.

Ther. 2002; 302: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, our studies suggest that the c-src/STAT3 pathway may be an important interventional target in chronic inflammation as well as in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2019133761,"The ability of integrin adhesion receptors to undergo rapid changes in affinity for their extracellular ligands (integrin activation) is essential for the development and function of multicellular animals and is dependent on interactions between the integrin β subunit-cytoplasmic tail and the cytoskeletal protein talin. Cross-talk among different integrins and between integrins and other receptors impacts many cellular processes including adhesion, spreading, migration, clot retraction, proliferation, and differentiation. One form of integrin cross-talk, transdominant inhibition of integrin activation, occurs when ligand binding to one integrin inhibits the activation of a second integrin. This may be relevant clinically in a number of settings such as during platelet adhesion, leukocyte trans-migration, and angiogenesis. Here we report that competition for talin underlies the trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation. This conclusion is based on our observations that (i) β tails selectively defective in talin binding are unable to mediate trans-dominant inhibition, (ii) trans-dominant inhibition can be reversed by overexpression of integrin binding and activating fragments of talin, and (iii) expression of another non-integrin talin-binding protein, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ-90, also inhibits integrin activation. Thus, the sequestration of talin by the suppressive species is both necessary and sufficient for trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation.

Tight control of integrin activation is required for many biological processes including embryonic development, wound healing, hemostasis, immune response, and tumor cell metastasis (6Martin-Bermudo M.D. Dunin-Borkowski O.M.

Most cells express more than one integrin, and cross-talk between integrins allows ligand binding to one integrin to regulate the function of other integrins on the same cell (9Diaz-Gonzalez F.

One form of integrin cross-talk occurs when ligation of one integrin inhibits the activation of a second integrin, the socalled trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation (9Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Trans-dominant inhibition mediated by β1, β2, or β3 integrins has been demonstrated in a variety of cell types and shown to regulate cell adhesion, spreading, migration, clot retraction, and differentiation (9Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 10Porter J.C. Hogg N. J.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 3715-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Trans-dominant integrin inhibition may be relevant physiologically and clinically in a number of settings. For example, α2β1-dependent platelet adhesion to collagen is inhibited following αIIbβ3-mediated fibrinogen binding to ADP-activated platelets (14Riederer M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Steiner B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and this may contribute to increased platelet adhesion to the subendothelium in Glanzmann's thrombastenia and afibrinogenemia (14Riederer M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Steiner B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in patients with acute coronary syndrome, transdominant inhibition of α2β1 may underlie the significant long term reduction of clinical events following short term treatment with pharmacological αIIbβ3 inhibitors (14Riederer M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Steiner B. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 858-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Trans-dominant inhibition also regulates adhesion of human T-lymphocytes and thus contributes to the control of leukocyte transmigration (10Porter J.C. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, there is now considerable interest in whether αvβ3-mediated trans-dominant inhibition of α5β1 accounts for the effects of endogenous or pharmaceutical antagonists of αvβ3 on tumor angiogenesis (19Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E65-E68Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 21Hynes R.O. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 22Hamano Y. Zeisberg M. Sugimoto H.

Despite its potential importance, the mechanism of transdominant integrin inhibition has not been elucidated. However, it is known that inhibition is dependent on the β subunitcytoplasmic tail of the suppressive integrin (9Diaz-Gonzalez F. Forsyth J. Steiner B. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1939-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the expression of isolated integrin β tails fused to an irrelevant type I trans-membrane and extracellular domain in a variety of cell lines, megakaryocytes, and platelets and in the thymus and cardiac tissue in vivo is sufficient to induce trans-dominant integrin inhibition (20Schmeissner P.J.

Fail. 2002; 8: 262-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One explanation for trans-dominant inhibition is that the suppressive β tail competes with other integrin β tails for limiting cytoplasmic factors necessary for integrin activation (23Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 390: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, trans-dominant integrin inhibition may be mediated by the titration of essential intracellular protein(s). Talin, a cytoskeletal protein, binds to most integrin β tails (32Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Talin binding to the integrin β tail activates integrins (33Calderwood D.A. Yan B. de Pereda J.M. Alvarez B.G. Fujioka Y. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Science. 2003; 301: 1720-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), and disruption of the integrin-talin interaction prevents integrin activation (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Thus, talin binding to integrin β tails is a final step in integrin activation. Therefore, we examined whether competition for talin mediates trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation. We report that β tails containing mutations that selectively inhibit talin binding are unable to mediate trans-dominant integrin inhibition and that overexpression of the integrin β tail-binding domain of talin can reverse trans-dominant inhibition. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ-90 (PIPKIγ-90) 1The abbreviations used are: PIPKγ, phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type Iγ; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FN9–11, fibronectin, type III repeats 9–11; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PI, propidium iodide; AI, activation index; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. binds talin and competes for talin binding to integrin β tails. The overexpression of PIPKIγ-90 also inhibits integrin activation. In contrast, PIPKIγ-87, a variant that lacks the talin-binding site, fails to inhibit integrin activation. Thus, the sequestration of talin causes this form of trans-dominant integrin inhibition.

Tac-transfected cells were suspended and stained with PAC-1 and then washed and stained with biotinylated anti-Tac mAb 7G7B6. Bound PAC-1 and 7G7B6 were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (BioSource) and streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) respectively. GFP-transfected cells were suspended and stained with PAC-1 and then washed and stained with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (Biomeda). Five min prior to analysis, propidium iodide (PI; 2 μg/ml final) was added. Cells were washed and analyzed on a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). PAC-1 binding to live (PI-negative) transfected (7G7B6- or GFP-positive) cells was assessed. Activation was quantified as an activation index defined as AI = (F – Fo)/(Fmax – Fo), where F is the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of PAC-1 binding, Fo is the MFI of PAC-1 binding in presence of the αIIbβ3 antagonist Ro43-5054 (1 μm), and Fmax is the MFI of PAC-1 binding in the presence of αβ3-activating mAb anti-LIBS6 (2 μm). Percentage inhibitions were calculated as 100× (AI0 – AI)/(AI0) where AI0 = AI in cells transfected with the control vector (Tac-α5 or GFP). FACS Analysis of the Activation State of α5β1—CHO cells were transfected transiently as described above, and 24 h later, they were analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (35Tadokoro S.

Cells were washed and, where necessary, stained with anti-Tac mAb 7G7B6. Bound GST-FN9–11 and 7G7B6 were detected with streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BioSource) respectively. Five min prior to analysis, PI (2 μg/ml final) was added. GST-FN9–11 binding to live (PI-negative) transfected (7G7B6- or GFP-positive) cells was assessed.

Percentage inhibition was calculated as for PAC-1. Cell-spreading Assays—CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 were transfected transiently as described above with cDNAs encoding Tac-α5, Tac-β3, or Tac-β3 mutants (2 μg) and enhanced GFP (1 μg) as a marker of transfection. Twenty-four h later, cells were plated onto tissue culture dishes coated with 15 μg/ml fibrinogen. Cells were allowed to spread for 1 h and were viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 100 epifluorescence microscope with a ×10 objective. Bright-field and GFP images were collected on a SPOT charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Images were processed, and the area of GFP-positive cells was calculated using Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, MD, www.scioncorp.com). Isolated β Tails Require an Intact Talin-binding Site to Mediate Trans-dominant Inhibition of Integrin αIIbβ3 Activation— Integrin activation is inhibited by overexpression of integrin β3 tails fused to the trans-membrane and extracellular domains of the Tac subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (Tac-β3) (26Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether competition for talin mediates trans-dominant inhibition, we generated Tac-β3 constructs with impaired talin binding activity and assessed their effect on integrin activation. We previously identified point mutations at Trp739 and Leu746 in the β3 tail that inhibit talin binding from cell lysates without detectably inhibiting the binding of other proteins from platelets (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) or CHO cells (data not shown). Furthermore, these mutations inhibited the direct interaction between recombinant integrin β3 tails and purified talin (Fig. 1, B and C). Substitution of Tyr747 with Ala also inhibited the binding of talin; however, this mutation is not specific for talin as the binding of many other proteins also is inhibited (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Thus, W739A or L746A substitutions in the β3 tail selectively inhibit direct talin binding to integrin β3 tails in vitro, whereas D740A or D740K mutations do not inhibit direct binding. When introduced into full-length integrins, W739A or L746A substitutions disrupt integrin activation, a process dependent on talin binding (35Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), indicating that these mutations also inhibit talin binding in vivo. The introduction of mutations that selectively disrupt talin binding into Tac-β3 allowed us to investigate the role of talin in trans-dominant inhibition of integrin activation. The activation state of αIIbβ3 integrins was assessed by measuring the binding of the ligand-mimetic mAb, PAC-1 (47Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells stably expressing αIIbβ3 were transfected with vector encoding Tac-β3 mutants, Tac-β3, or Tac-α5 (a negative control) (26Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h later, the cells were harvested, and the binding of anti-Tac (to quantify Tac expression levels) and PAC-1 (to assess integrin affinity state) to live (PI-negative) cells was analyzed by three-color flow cytometry. As reported previously (26Chen Y.-P. O'Toole T.E. Shipley T. Forsyth J. LaFlamme S.E. Yamada K.M. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18307-18310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the cells expressing Tac-β3, but not those expressing Tac-α5, exhibited inhibition of integrin activation that correlated with Tac expression as evidenced by a diagonal slope of the leftward shift of the FACS dot plot (Fig. 2A). Inhibition was cell-autonomous because only transfected cells showed a reduction in activation. Furthermore, the addition of the activating monoclonal antibody, anti-LIBS6, stimulated PAC-1 binding to similar levels in all of the cells (data not shown), showing that the inhibition of PAC-1 binding was not the result of a reduction in the expression of αIIbβ3 following transfection with Tac-β3. Notably, Tac-β3W739A or L746A, mutants that are selectively deficient in talin binding, failed to suppress PAC-1 binding (Fig. 2A). Thus, the mutations that disrupt talin binding inhibit trans-dominant suppression of αIIbβ3 by isolated β tails. The activation index (the ratio of specific PAC-1 binding: maximal anti-LIBS6-stimulated specific PAC-1 binding) allows the quantification of αIIbβ3 activation (45O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Culley B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8553-8558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Tac-β3 or Tac-β3 containing mutations that maintain talin binding (D740A or D740K) produced a >60% inhibition of αIIbβ3 activation, whereas Tac-β3 containing mutations that disrupt talin binding (W739A,L746A,K748A, or L746A) had little effect on integrin activation (Fig. 2B). The differing effects of the Tac-β3 mutants were not attributed to differing expression levels, because the analyses were performed on cells gated for similar Tac expression. Furthermore, Western blotting of immunoprecipitated Tac-β3 revealed that all of the Tac-β3 constructs reacted with an antiserum raised against the C-terminal portion of the β3 tail (Fig. 2C), suggesting that differential proteolysis of the Tac-β3 mutants does not account for their differing effects on integrin activation. Hence, free β3 tails require an intact talin-binding site to mediate trans-dominant inhibition of αIIbβ3. Trans-dominant Inhibition of Activated β1 and β3 Integrins Requires an Intact Talin-binding Site in the Suppressive-free β Tail—When expressed in CHO cells, αIIbβ3 is activated weakly (activation index 0.22 ± 0.02; mean ± S.E.) (38O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To test whether competition for talin also mediated the trans-dominant inhibition of more active integrins, we examined chimeric αIIbβ3 integrins. The substitution of the α5-cytoplasmic tail for that of αIIb generates a more active integrin, αIIbα5β3 (activation index 0.45 ± 0.03; mean ± S.E.) (37O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Tac-β3 inhibited the activation of this active chimera, and this inhibition was impaired by mutations that reduce talin binding (Fig. 3A). Therefore, talin binding to Tac-β3 is required for trans-dominant inhibition of β3 integrins, regardless of their activation state. Furthermore, this effect is not limited to β3 integrins, because similar results were obtained with active (activation index 0.40 ± 0.03) chimeric αIIbβ3 integrins containing the α6Aβ1A-cytoplasmic domains (αIIbα6Aβ3β1A) (Fig. 3B). The experiments described above assessed the activation of ectopically expressed αIIbβ3 or chimeric αIIbβ3 integrins using the mAb PAC-1. As an alternative approach, we used an integrin binding fragment of FN9–11 to assess the activation state of endogenous CHO α5β1 integrins (42Hughes P.E. Oertli B. Hansen M. Chou F.L. Willumsen B.M. Ginsberg M.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2256-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The binding of FN9–11 is specific, because it can be inhibited by EDTA or function by blocking anti-α5β1 antibodies and can be stimulated by the β1-activating antibody, 9EG7, and Mn2+ (data not shown). Using this approach, we found that Tac-β3, but not"
https://openalex.org/W2025572792,"We have exploited a variety of molecular genetic, biochemical, and genomic techniques to investigate the roles of purine salvage enzymes in the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii. The ability to generate defined genetic knockouts and target transgenes to specific loci demonstrates that T. gondii uses two (and only two) pathways for purine salvage, defined by the enzymes hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) and adenosine kinase (AK). Both HXGPRT and AK are single-copy genes, and either one can be deleted, indicating that either one of these pathways is sufficient to meet parasite purine requirements. Fitness defects suggest both pathways are important for the parasite, however, and that the salvage of adenosine is more important than salvage of hypoxanthine and other purine nucleobases. HXGPRT and AK cannot be deleted simultaneously unless one of these enzymes is provided in trans, indicating that alternative routes of functionally significant purine salvage are lacking. Despite previous reports to the contrary, we found no evidence of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) activity when parasites were propagated in APRT-deficient host cells, and no APRT ortholog is evident in the T. gondii genome. Expression of Leishmania donovani APRT in transgenic T. gondii parasites yielded low levels of activity but did not permit genetic deletion of both HXGPRT and AK. A detailed comparative genomic study of the purine salvage pathway in various apicomplexan species highlights important differences among these parasites.

A detailed comparative genomic study of the purine salvage pathway in various apicomplexan species highlights important differences among these parasites. Like all parasitic protozoa, the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii lacks the ability to synthesize the purine ring de novo, and thus relies entirely on the salvage of purines from the host cell to meet its nutritional needs (1Perotto J. Keister D.B. Gelderman A.H. J. Protozool. 1971; 18: 470-473Google Scholar, 2Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Google Scholar, 3Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol.

This requirement, coupled with the shortcomings of conventional therapies for treating congenital toxoplasmosis and opportunistic infections associated with AIDS and other immunosuppressive conditions (4Haverkos H.W.

Remington J.S. Luft B.J. Antimicrob. Agents Annu. 1987; 2: 297-306Google Scholar), makes purine salvage an attractive target for chemotherapy. The purine metabolism of T. gondii has previously been examined biochemically, resulting in the identification of various activities capable of assimilating nucleosides and nucleobases from the host cell into the purine nucleotide pools of the parasite (2Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Google Scholar, 3Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Google Scholar). (See “Discussion” for a model of the purine salvage pathway in Toxoplasma and other apicomplexan parasites.) Reported salvage activities include the phosphoribosylation of adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, and the phosphorylation of adenosine. The latter seems to contribute most significantly to parasite purine economy, as adenosine is incorporated into nucleotide pools at a considerably higher rate than any purine nucleobase (2Schwartzman J.D. Pfefferkorn E.R. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 77-86Google Scholar, 3Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Google Scholar). Most of the reported salvage activities can be accounted for by two enzymes: hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HXGPRT) 1The abbreviations used are: HXGPRT, hypoxanthine-xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase; AK, adenosine kinase; AMP, adenosine 5′-monophosphates; APRT, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase; 6TX, 6-thioxanthine; 8-azaA, 8-azaadenine; 2-FA, 2-fluoroadenine. and adenosine kinase (AK). The genes for both have been cloned and expressed in bacterial systems, and the purified proteins have been examined biochemically and structurally (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar, 10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem.

Biol. 2000; 296: 549-567Google Scholar). Genetic studies indicate that neither enzyme is essential for parasite viability, suggesting that the purine salvage pathways of the parasite are functionally redundant. The incorporation of labeled inosine and hypoxanthine into adenine nucleotides, and of labeled adenosine into IMP, indicates that AMP and IMP are interconvertible. The conversion of AMP to IMP (via AMP deaminase), and of IMP to AMP (via adenylosuccinate synthetase/lyase) probably predominate, although adenine and adenosine deaminase activities (3Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Google Scholar) may also play a role. Despite the previously measured incorporation of adenine by Toxoplasma, no adenine phosphoribosyltransferase gene has been identified in this or any other apicomplexan parasite. In the present study, we have integrated genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches to explore the contributions of HXGPRT and AK in maintaining a robust purine salvage pathway. The ability of T. gondii to grow in virtually any nucleated mammalian cell (14Pfefferkorn E.R. Schwartzman J.D. Kaspar L.H. Cytopathology of Parasitic Disease. 99. Putnam Books, London1983: 74-91Google Scholar), combined with the availability of various mammalian somatic cell mutants and the ability to genetically manipulate the parasite (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar), has allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the role played by individual parasite enzymes in overall purine nutrition. These studies provide formal proof that all purine salvage in T. gondii proceeds via HXGPRT or AK (there is no functional APRT activity), and fitness assays support the suggestion that AK is metabolically more important than HXGPRT. We have also exploited the large-scale genomic datasets now available for multiple apicomplexan species to create detailed maps of purine salvage pathways for several of these parasites, an important first step toward identifying potential drug targets for broad-spectrum anti-parasitic chemotherapy. Parasites, Cells, Chemicals, and Reagents—T. gondii strain RH (available through Ogden Bioservices Corporation, Rockville, MD) or mutants derived from this strain were used for all in vitro tissue culture experiments and were cultivated in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF cells) or other fibroblast cells, as described previously (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar, 16Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Google Scholar). [14C]Adenine (56 Ci mol–1), [14C]xanthine (57 Ci mol–1), [3H]adenosine (48 Ci mmol–1), and [3H]uracil (20 Ci mmol–1) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). All unlabeled subversive substrates of purine salvage enzymes were purchased from Sigma. DNA modifying enzymes were acquired from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DE81 anion-exchange filters were obtained from Whatman (Hillsboro, OR). Molecular Genetic Manipulations—All molecular manipulations were performed according to standard protocols (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Isolation of parasite genomic DNA was carried out by digestion with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) in the presence of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Digested genomic DNA was blotted to Nytran filter paper and processed as described. The AK probe consisted of the open reading frame of the AK cDNA excised from the pBAceAK expression vector (11Darling J.A. Sullivan Jr., W.J. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 15-23Google Scholar) by digestion with NdeI and XbaI. The HXGPRT probe was isolated from a similar expression vector (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar) by digestion with NdeI. Probes were purified from agarose gels by Qiagen gel purification kit and 32P labeled utilizing Stratagene Prime-It II™ random primer labeling kit. Generation of Defined Knockouts—Plasmids for generating defined knockouts at the HXGPRT or AK loci (constructs HXGPRT-KO and AK-KO) have been described previously, as have the methods employed to isolate mutant parasites (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar, 10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Google Scholar). The HXGPRT::AK knockout construct was constructed by inserting an AK cDNA driven by the T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase promoter into the HXGPRT-KO vector. The construct pminAK (10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII and NotI to remove the AK expression cassette (AK cDNA flanked by dihydrofolate reductase 5′ and 3′ sequences), and the resulting fragment was blunted and gel-purified using the Qiagen gel purification kit. The HXGPRT-KO vector was digested with SalI and blunted by removal of a 5.5-kb SalI fragment, which was replaced by ligation with the AK expression cassette. The (blunt) 5.5-kb SalI fragment was digested with SacI, and the resulting fragment was reintroduced by ligation into the vector polylinker (NotI [blunt]-SacI) downstream of the AK expression cassette. Targeting of this AK transgene to the HXGPRT locus was accomplished as described (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar) by selection in 320 μg/ml 6-thioxanthine (6TX). Enzyme Assays—After lysis of the host cell monolayer, parasites were isolated from residual host cell debris by filtration through 3-μm Nucleopore filters. Parasites were pelleted by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before resuspension in 500 μl of TMD buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) and lysis by sonication on ice or the addition of 1% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay and normalized for all enzymatic determinations. All enzyme assays were conducted according to the radiometric methods described previously (17de Jong J.W. Keijzer E. Uitendaal M.P. Harmsen E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 407-412Google Scholar, 18Miller R.L. Lindstead D. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1983; 7: 41-51Google Scholar). AK reactions were performed in a 50-μl volume at 37 °C in TMD buffer with 1 mm ATP, 5 mm NaF (to inhibit phosphatase activity), 25 μCi of [3H]adenosine (48 Ci mmol–1), and appropriate volumes of crude parasite lysate. Reactions were terminated by spotting 10 μl of the reaction mix onto DEAE anion-exchange filters. Filters were washed 3× in water and once in ethanol, dried completely at 60 °C; radioactivity was assessed by liquid scintillation counting. Measurements were taken over a 120-min time course. Xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT) and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) reactions were performed similarly, using PRT reaction mixes containing TMD buffer with 1 mm phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, 0.3 μCi of [14C]xanthine (57 Ci mol–1) or 1.3 μCi of [14C]-adenine (56 Ci mol–1), and appropriate volumes of crude lysate. Sensitivity of T. gondii to Toxic Adenine Analogs—The growth of intracellular T. gondii was measured in confluent 24-well plates of either wild-type human foreskin fibroblasts or APRT-deficient mouse fibroblasts by the incorporation of [3H]uracil into acid-precipitable material. Parasites were grown in the presence of either 2-fluoroadenine (2-FA) (2 ng/ml to 200 μg/ml) or 8-azaadenine (8-azaA) (10 ng/ml to 100 μg/ml). After 48 h growth, parasites were subjected to a 4-h pulse of 5 μCi of [3H]uracil (20 Ci mmol–1), and plates were processed as described (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). In Vitro Uptake of [14C]Adenine—Parasites were infected at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well into 24-well plates containing confluent monolayers of APRT-deficient mammalian host cells. After 24 h, 1.3 μCi of [14C]adenine (56 Ci mol–1) was added to each well, and adenine incorporation was allowed to proceed for 4 h before plates were processed as described for measurement of [14C]adenine incorporation (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Acid precipitable material was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Expression of Leishmania donovani APRT in T. gondii—The open reading frame of the L. donovani APRT (19Allen T. Hwang H.Y. Wilson K. Hanson S. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 99-103Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech), utilizing a 5′ primer, GGAagatctATGGCCTTCAAGGAAGTCAG, and a 3′ primer, AGTAgctagcGTGCGGGTGCTCGGCCAG (restriction sites in lowercase). The 5′ primer converted the second amino acid of LdAPRT from Pro to Ala, for optimized expression in Toxoplasma (20Matrajt M. Nishi M. Fraunholz M.J. Peter O. Roos D.S. Mol Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 120: 285-289Google Scholar). The amplified fragment was digested with BglII and NheI, gel-purified, and ligated into appropriately digested ptubACP-YFP-HA vector, 2M. Nishi and D. S. Roos, manuscript in preparation. replacing the acyl carrier protein-green fluorescent protein open reading frame with that of the LdAPRT. This vector also contains a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase selectable marker under the control of the SAG1 promoter (21Kim K. Soldati D. Boothroyd J.C. Science. 1993; 262: 911-914Google Scholar). The resulting ptubLdAPRT-HA fusion construct was electroporated into wild-type, ΔAK, and ΔHXGPRT parasites as described (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were allowed to infect confluent fibroblast monolayers in 24-well plates, and after 24 h of growth, were processed for immunofluorescence detection of APRT-HA fusion protein. Samples were fixed in paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in Triton X-100, and assayed with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:1500 dilution). Transfected parasites were also subjected to chloramphenicol selection (6 μg/ml); parasites surviving three rounds of passage in drug were cloned by limiting dilution in drug (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar) and assayed for APRT activity. Fitness Assays—Competition assays between the parental wild-type and ΔHXGPRT and ΔAK parasites were performed as described (22Fohl L.M. Roos D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1319-1327Google Scholar). For detection of viable wild-type or knockout parasites at various time-points, plaque assays were performed in 6-well plates in the presence of suitable selective drugs (15Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Google Scholar). Mycophenolic acid or 6-thioxanthine was used as selection for ΔHXGPRT versus wild-type competition: the former selects for wild-type parasites, whereas the latter selects for ΔHXGPRT parasites. Similarly, adenine arabinoside was used to select for ΔAK mutants in competitions against wild-type parasites. Genomic Analysis—A BLAST searchable database of all publicly available Apicomplexan genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences (constructed by Dr. Martin Fraunholz, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) was used for this study. This database contains complete or nearly complete genomic sequences for Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii (5X), T. gondii (10X), Eimeria tenella (5X) and Theileria annulata (8X), Cryptsporidium parvum (7X), Cryptosporidium hominis (12X), Tetrahymena thermophila, and additional genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences from P. chabaudi, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, T. gondii, E. tenella, and Theileria parva. 3The following are available on the World Wide Web: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium yoelii are from //PlasmoDB.org; T. gondii is from //ToxoDB.org; Eimeria tenella and Theileria annulata are from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens; Cryptsporidium parvum is from www.parvum.mic.vcu.edu/; Cryptosporidium hominis is from www.cbc.umn.edu/ResearchProjects/AGAC/Cp/index.htm; Tetrahymena thermophila is from www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/ttg/; P. chabaudi, P. vivax, P. knowlesi, T. gondii, and E. tenella are from www.cbil.upenn.edu/paradbsservlet/index.html and ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens; and Theileria parva genome was obtained from www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/tpa1/. Putative homologs of purine salvage transporters and enzymes were identified by using TBLASTN (WU-BLAST), with a cutoff of p < 10–9. Previously published and/or annotated sequences for the Apicomplexan purine salvage genes were used as query sequences whenever possible. A complete list of query sequences and matches is provided as supplemental material. Defined Genetic Knockouts of Purine Salvage Enzymes—Successful genetic knock-outs of either the AK or HXGPRT loci have been described previously and shown to be deficient in the corresponding purine salvage activities (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar, 10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Google Scholar). The ease of generating such mutants prompted efforts to delete both loci in a single parasite. A summary of the results from numerous such experiments is provided in Table I. Deletion of either individual locus was readily achieved, using AK-KO or HXGPRT-KO constructs (see “Materials and Methods”). In contrast, in three independent experiments, we were unable to delete the AK locus in the ΔHXGPRT background (based on adenine arabinoside selection of parasites transfected with the AK-KO construct), or to delete the HXGPRT locus in the ΔAK background (based on 6TX selection of parasites transfected with the HXGPRT-KO construct). Parasites resistant to both adenine arabinoside and 6TX were occasionally isolated in the latter experiment (using 6TX selection), but DNA hybridization analysis revealed no obvious lesion at the HXGPRT locus, and Western blotting showed normal levels of HXGPRT protein. These parasites are presumed to harbor substrate specificity mutations at the HXGPRT locus or mutations at other loci that affect 6TX toxicity.Table ISummary of attempts to knock out AK and HXGPRT lociParental genotypeTransfection constructSelectionResistant parasites?Deletion of targeted gene?RH, wild-typeAK-KOAraAYesYesRH, wild-typeHXGPRT-KO6TXYesYesΔHXGPRTAK-KOAraANoNoΔAKHXGPRT-KO6TXYesNoΔAKHXGPRT::AK6TXYesYesΔHXGPRT, LdAPRT+AK-KOAraANoNoΔAK, LdAPRT+HXGPRT-KO6TXYesNo Open table in a new tab The inability to delete both HXGPRT and AK suggests that the double-knockout phenotype may be lethal for T. gondii. To further address this hypothesis, we attempted to genetically delete both loci, while providing AK activity in trans (producing a double knock-out genotype that is nevertheless AK+). The HXGPRT-KO construct was modified to contain the coding region of T. gondii AK (driven by the T. gondii dihydrofolate reductase promoter), generating construct HXGPRT::AK. 6TX-resistant parasites were readily obtained after transfection of ΔAK parasites, and the resulting clones were tested by Southern analysis to assess their genotype and enzyme assays to assess purine salvage activities, as shown in Fig. 1. As expected, probing with AK cDNA demonstrates genomic EcoRI fragments of 2.1 and 3.8 kb in wild-type and ΔHXGPRT parasites and deletion of the larger fragment in the ΔAK mutant (10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Google Scholar). This same pattern was observed in the HXGPRT::AK mutant, demonstrating maintenance of the ΔAK genotype. In addition, a larger band was also observed of the size expected from integration of the HXGPRT::AK plasmid at the HXGPRT locus (Fig. 1, arrowhead). The same size band was observed with an HXGPRT probe, which also shows that the endogenous HXGPRT locus (observed in wild-type parasites and ΔAK mutants) was successfully disrupted in the HXGPRT::AK mutant. The smaller size of the HXGPRT locus in this mutant relative to the ΔHXGPRT clone is attributable to molecular manipulations associated with construction of the HXGPRT::AK vector (see “Materials and Methods”). Enzyme assays demonstrate no AK activity in the ΔAK parent but show activity comparable with that of wild-type parasites (and ΔHXGPRT mutants) when AK was targeted to the HXGPRT locus in the ΔAK background. XPRT assays show normal activity in the ΔAK parent but none in HXGPRT:AK parasites, similar to the ΔHXGPRT mutants characterized previously (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar). Taken together, these results demonstrate that it is possible to disrupt both the AK and HXGPRT genetic loci simultaneously, but only if one of these activities is provided in trans (in this case, by expression of AK at the disrupted HXGPRT locus). APRT Activity and Parasite Sensitivity to Subversive Substrates of APRT—The inability to generate ΔHXGPRT, ΔAK double-knock-out parasites is somewhat surprising, given the previous identification of APRT activity in T. gondii (3Krug E.C. Marr J.J. Berens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10601-10607Google Scholar), which could provide for an alternative route of purine assimilation for the parasite. Consistent with prior reports, RH-strain T. gondii cultivated in normal human foreskin fibroblasts were susceptible to both 2-FA (IC50 ∼ 75 ng/ml) and 8-azaA (IC50 ∼ 1.5 μg/ml), as shown in Fig. 2 (white symbols). These adenine analogs are known to function as subversive substrates of APRT, and both have been shown to produce APRT-dependent toxicity in other systems (23Savarese T.M. Cannistra A.J. Parks Jr., R.E. Secrist 3rd, J.A. Shortnacy A.T. Montgomery J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1881-1893Google Scholar, 24Pongsaensook P. Smith L.E. Grosovsky A.J. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 27-36Google Scholar, 25Dare E. Roelofs M.H. Simi S. Pavanello S. Pilli F. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 203: 336-343Google Scholar). When parasites were grown in APRT-deficient cells (16Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Google Scholar), however, IC50s for both drugs increased to >100 μg/ml, a decrease in sensitivity of ∼2.7 × 103 and 67-fold for 2-FA and 8-azaA, respectively (Fig. 2, black symbols). These results suggest that toxicity of 2-FA and 8-azaA is dependent upon host, rather than parasite, APRT activity. Furthermore, although variable levels of APRT activity were observed in crude cytosolic extracts of parasites cultivated in wild-type human foreskin fibroblasts (data not shown), we were completely unable to detect phosphoribosylation of radiolabeled adenine when parasites were grown in APRT-deficient fibroblasts (Table II), supporting the suggestion that parasites lack an endogenous APRT activity. In addition, T. gondii tachyzoites grown in APRT-deficient host cells incorporate only very low levels of [4C]adenine (see Fig. 3B).Table IISpecific activities for purine salvage enzymes in wild-type and LdAPRT-expressing parasitesSubstrateParasite lineAdenineAdenosineXanthineRH, wt0.02 ± 0.0215.7 ± 1.14.8 ± 0.8RH, LdAPRT+1.35 ± 0.0814.3 ± 0.65.1 ± 1.2ΔAK, LdAPRT+1.12 ± 0.070.02 ± 0.014.9 ± 0.5ΔHXGPRT, LdAPRT+1.29 ± 0.0815.2 ± 1.60.01 ± 0.01 Open table in a new tab Expression of L. donovani APRT in T. gondii—To further probe purine salvage pathways in T. gondii, we attempted to express L. donovani APRT in wild-type, ΔAK, and ΔHXGPRT T. gondii. An LdAPRT-HA fusion construct (see “Materials and Methods”) was expressed in the parasite cytosol (Fig. 3A), and the resultant protein possesses APRT activity both in vivo (Fig. 3B) and in vitro (Fig. 3C and Table II). Wild-type parasites incorporate very little [14C]adenine into acid-precipitable material when grown in APRT-deficient host cells, in contrast to transgenic parasites expressing L. donovani APRT (Fig. 3B). APRT activity was virtually undetectable in cell-free extracts of wild-type RH-strain parasites (grown in APRT-deficient host cells), but significant levels of activity were seen in RH:LdAPRT, ΔAK:LdAPRT, and ΔHXGPRT:LdAPRT transgenics (Fig. 3C and Table II). Analysis of other purine salvage activities in parasites expressing high levels of LdAPRT indicates that HXGPRT and AK activities are unaffected by the presence of the transgenic APRT activity (Table II). Interestingly, the relative values of these salvage activities suggest that adenosine utilization in T. gondii is significantly more efficient than for other purines, whereas the activity of transgenic APRT is detectable but considerably lower than either AK or HXGPRT. To explore whether APRT-expressing parasites might be amenable to genetic deletion of both the AK and HXGPRT loci, ΔAK:LdAPRT and ΔHXGPRT:LdAPRT parasites were transfected with HXGPRT-KO or AK-KO vectors (respectively) and subjected to selection for deletion of either locus. As indicated in Table I, no double knock-outs have been identified to date. Fitness Assays for ΔAK and ΔHXGPRT Parasites—Previous studies on ΔAK and ΔHXGPRT mutants showed no dramatic differences in growth rates as compared with the wild-type parasites from which they were derived (9Donald R.G. Carter D. Ullman B. Roos D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14010-14019Google Scholar, 10Sullivan Jr., W.J. Chiang C.W. Wilson C.M. Naguib F.N. el Kouni M.H. Donald R.G. Roos D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 1-14Google Scholar). More recently, however, we have found that sensitive competition assays enable the detection of subtle fitness defects in other mutants (22Fohl L.M. Roos D.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1319-1327Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, both the ΔAK and ΔHXGPRT knockout lines showed significant fitness impairment, with ΔAK parasites displaying a fitness defect of 7.6% per generation (Fig. 4A) and ΔHXGPRT exhibiting a defect of 3.7% per generation (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that both AK and HXGPRT play an important role in parasite metabolism and fitness, although the presence of neither gene is essential for viability, as noted above. The larger defect observed in ΔAK supports the suggestion that this enzyme plays the more important role in purine salvage.

https://openalex.org/W2103279939,"Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases are recruited by transcription factors and adapter proteins to regulate specific subsets of target genes. We were interested in identifying interaction partners of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that might be involved in conferring target or substrate specificity. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we isolated the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) as a novel HDAC1-associated protein. We demonstrated the in vivo interaction of REA with HDAC1 and characterized the respective domains required for their interaction in vitro. In addition, we found that REA also associates with the class II histone deacetylase HDAC5. In luciferase reporter assays, REA decreased transcription, and this repression was sensitive to the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. Finally, we showed that REA specifically interacts with the chicken ovalbumin upstream binding transcription factors and II. The nuclear receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream binding transcription factor I was found to cooperate with REA and histone deacetylases in the repression of target genes. We, therefore, propose a novel function for REA as a mediator of transcriptional repression by nuclear hormone receptors via recruitment of histone deacetylases.

Eukaryotic DNA is packaged into highly dynamic chromatin, the basic unit of which is the nucleosome. This consists of a central “hub” comprising two of each of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, around which are wrapped 146 bp of DNA. The highly conserved histone proteins are subject to several post-translational modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and sumoylation. Extensive studies have forged a link between the acetylation state of chromatin and its transcriptional status. Dynamic acetylation and deacetylation of lysine residues within the N-terminal tails of core histones seem to be necessary for a series of crucial nuclear events such as silencing, replication, and correct DNA repair. Initial research into the relevance of histone acetylation aimed at identifying and characterizing the enzymes involved; that is, the histone acetyltransferases and their antagonists, the histone deacetylases (HDACs). 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; REA, repressor of estrogen receptor activity; GST, glutathione S-transferase; COUP-TF, chicken ovalbumin upstream binding transcription factor; TSA, trichostatin A; DBD, DNA binding domain; RXR, retinoid X receptor; TR, thyroid hormone receptor; SRC-1, steroid receptor co-activator 1; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ERα, estrogen receptor α; aa, amino acids; HA, hemagglutinin; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1, 1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. Class I HDACs, which include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8, and HDAC11, have been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression, differentiation, and development (1Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Google Scholar), and a series of studies has revealed a potential role for HDACs in carcinogenesis (for review, see Ref. 2Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Google Scholar). The prototypical histone deacetylase HDAC1, a homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional modulator Rpd3 (3Vidal M. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6317-6327Google Scholar), was first identified using a trapoxin affinity matrix (4Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Google Scholar). An important aspect of HDAC1 function is its target specificity, determined predominantly by the precise composition of HDAC1-containing complexes and the nature of HDAC1-associated proteins. Apart from the well characterized SIN3 and NuRD complexes (Refs. 1Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Google Scholar and 5Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Google Scholar and references therein), an additional HDAC1-containing complex, named CoREST, has been isolated from human cells (6You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Google Scholar, 7Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6817-6824Google Scholar). HDAC2, the second member of the class I deacetylases, is commonly found within the same complexes as HDAC1 (1Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 121-126Google Scholar, 5Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Google Scholar, 6You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The third class I deacetylase HDAC3 is generally found to be associated with the co-repressors SMRT and N-CoR as well as with the class II deacetylase enzymes HDAC4 and HDAC5 (for review, see Ref. 8de Ruijter A.J. van Gennip A.H. Caron H.N. Kemp S. van Kuilenburg A.B. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 737-749Google Scholar). As yet little is known about the function of the two other members of the class I histone deacetylase family, the recently described HDAC8 (9Buggy J.J. Sideris M.L. Mak P. Lorimer D.D. McIntosh B. Clark J.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 199-205Google Scholar, 10Van den Wyngaert I. de Vries W. Kremer A. Neefs J. Verhasselt P. Luyten W.H. Kass S.U. FEBS Lett. 2000; 478: 77-83Google Scholar, 11Hu E. Chen Z.X. Fredrickson T. Zhu Y. Kirkpatrick R. Zhang G.F. Johanson K. Sung C.M. Liu R.G. Winkler J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15254-15264Google Scholar) and HDAC11 (12Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Google Scholar). Class II enzymes, comprising HDACs 4-7 and HDAC9-10, are generally linked to the regulation of differentiation-related genes, and in contrast to the strictly nuclear class I deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2, are found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells (13Khochbin S. Verdel A. Lemercier C. Seigneurin Berny D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 162-166Google Scholar). Class III deacetylases have been implicated in gene silencing and control of aging (14Shore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14030-14032Google Scholar, 15Guarente L. Kenyon C. Nature. 2000; 408: 255-262Google Scholar). A large number of transcription factors regulate gene expression through the recruitment of histone deacetylase complexes. Nuclear hormone receptors are well characterized examples of HDAC-recruiting proteins. Initially, the retinoic acid receptors and thyroid receptors were shown to interact indirectly with HDACs through their interaction with N-CoR and SMRT in the absence of ligand (16Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Google Scholar, 17Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 43-48Google Scholar). Recruitment of HDAC2 through N-CoR and SMRT was also described for steroid receptors in the presence of partial antihormones (18Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Google Scholar). Similarly, HDACs associate both in vitro and in vivo with different transcription cofactors that bind nuclear receptors in the presence of agonists (19Wei L.N. Hu X. Chandra D. Seto E. Farooqui M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40782-40787Google Scholar, 20Wei L.N. Farooqui M. Hu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16107-16112Google Scholar, 21Fernandes I. Bastien Y. Wai T. Nygard K. Lin R. Cormier O. Lee H.S. Eng F. Bertos N.R. Pelletier N. Mader S. Han V.K. Yang X.J. White J.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 139-150Google Scholar). More recently, a direct association between HDACs and nuclear receptors was reported (22Kawai H. Li H. Avraham S. Jiang S. Avraham H.K. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 353-358Google Scholar), thus increasing the complexity of the interaction between these two types of partners. HDAC1 is certainly the best-studied mammalian histone deacetylase. The enzyme is not only essential for mouse development but also for normal proliferation of mouse embryos and embryonic stem cells (23Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Google Scholar). HDAC1 expression has to be tightly regulated since both overexpression and loss of HDAC1 result in severe disturbance of proliferation and cell cycle progression (23Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Google Scholar, 24Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Google Scholar). Transcription of the murine HDAC1 gene is induced by cooperative phosphorylation and acetylation signals, allowing both growth factor-dependent activation and feedback regulation (25Hauser C. Schuettengruber B. Bartl S. Lagger G. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7820-7830Google Scholar, 26Schuettengruber B. Simboeck E. Khier H. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6993-7004Google Scholar). In addition, post-translational modifications seem to be important for the biological function of the enzyme and the regulation of its activity by other factors (27Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Google Scholar, 28David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23658-23663Google Scholar, 29Colombo R. Boggio R. Seiser C. Draetta G.F. Chiocca S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1062-1068Google Scholar). HDAC1 has been shown to form homodimers and to associate with HDAC2 (30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar, 31Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Google Scholar). This has already led us to propose dimerization as a pivotal event for HDAC1 enzymatic activity (30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar). Apart from this, specific recruiting factors are required to confer high target specificity upon HDAC1. To this aim, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate hitherto unknown interaction partners of HDAC1. One of the candidate proteins isolated was the repressor of estrogen receptor activity (REA) (32Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Google Scholar). By co-immunoprecipitation experiments and glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, we established the interaction between REA and both HDAC1 and HDAC5. Moreover, we demonstrated that REA specifically interacts not only with estrogen receptor but also with the orphan nuclear receptors chicken ovalbumin upstream binding transcription factor (COUP-TF) I and II. Our data identify REA as novel HDAC-interacting protein that modulates the activity of a defined subset of nuclear hormone receptors. Chemicals and Materials—17β-Estradiol and 4-hydroxytamoxifen were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and resuspended in 96% ethanol. Custom oligonucleotides were purchased from VBC-Genomics, Vienna, Austria. Cell Culture and Cell Transfection—U2OS, HeLa, 293, Swiss 3T3, and MCF7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Embryonic stem cells were grown as previously described (23Lagger G. O'Carroll D. Rembold M. Khier H. Tischler J. Weitzer G. Schuettengruber B. Hauser C. Brunmeir R. Jenuwein T. Seiser C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2672-2681Google Scholar). DNA transfection was carried out according to the previously published polyethyleneimine transfection procedure (33Baker A. Saltik M. Lehrmann H. Killisch I. Mautner V. Lamm G. Christofori G. Cotten M. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 773-782Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—The murine B-cell receptor-associated protein 37 (mBAP37) cDNA was kindly provided by M. Lamers (34Terashima M. Kim K.M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3782-3792Google Scholar). Deletions were constructed using standard PCR-based methods. Specific information regarding oligonucleotide sequences is available upon request. The bait plasmid used in two-hybrid screening was constructed by inserting a PCR fragment corresponding to aa 299-482 of mouse HDAC1 into pEG202, downstream of the region encoding the LexA DNA binding domain (DBD). Prey libraries of HeLa cDNA or mouse embryonic brain cDNA were kindly provided by R. Brent and W. Stockinger, respectively. The REA cDNA fragment encoding aa 89-299 was PCR-amplified and subcloned via BamHI/XmaI into pQE30 for expression of His6-tagged REA in the Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS strain. Correct reading frames were verified by sequencing. REA deletion constructs were PCR-amplified and cloned into adequately digested pGEX4T1 vectors for expression as a GST fusion proteins. GST-HDAC1 constructs have been described elsewhere (30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar). The mHDA5 expression vector was kindly provided by S. Khochbin. Expression plasmids for COUP-TFI and II were obtained from M. G. Parker, and the GFP-tagged COUP-TFI plasmid was obtained from F. Pakdel. C-terminal and N-terminal deletion mutants of COUP-TFII were obtained by digestion with EagI and BamHI, respectively. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Plasmids and yeast strains used in this study were adapted from the system of R. Brent (68Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Google Scholar). The yeast strain EGY191, which contains a chromosomally integrated auxotrophic marker (LEU2) and an ectopic lacZ reporter plasmid (pSH18-34), was sequentially transformed with the bait-encoding pEG202-HDAC1 (299-482) plasmid and either the pJG4-5 mouse embryonic brain cDNA or the HeLa cDNA prey libraries. Transformants were plated on media lacking leucine. Galactose inducible LEU+ colonies exhibiting lacZ activity, as determined by filter-lift assays, were further characterized. Colonies harboring interacting prey proteins were used to quantify β-galactosidase activity by an o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-based liquid assay. Northern Blot Analysis—mRNA expression was analyzed using the Northern blot sandwich method as described previously (35Seiser C. Teixeira S. Kuhn L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13074-13080Google Scholar). Antibodies—To raise a specific antibody directed against mouse REA, the His6-tagged fragment (aa 89-299) expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS was used to immunize rabbits by standard methods. Antibodies were affinity-purified by overnight incubation on nitrocellulose strips loaded with recombinant His-REA. After washing with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, bound antibodies were eluted by sequential incubation with 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and 100 mm triethylamine, pH 10.0. Eluates were neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and tested for specificity by Western blot analysis. The REA antibody described above as well the HDAC1 monoclonal antibody 10E2 and the RbAp48 monoclonal antibody 13D10 are commercially available at Upstate Biotechnology. The estrogen receptor α antibody H-184, the Gal4 DNA-BD monoclonal antibody, and the MTA1 antibody C-17 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Other antibodies used in this study were the HA-specific monoclonal antibodies 12CA5 and 16B12 and the GFP monoclonal antibody from Clontech. Glutathione S-Transferase Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 DE3 pLysS. GST fusion proteins with HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 have been described previously (30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar). GST-SRC-1 and expression vectors for RXRα and TRα were obtained from M. G. Parker. Large scale preparation, purification of the recombinant proteins, and binding to the glutathione beads were performed as previously described (36Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Google Scholar). Beads coated with GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled full-length REA or HDAC1 protein for 2 h in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture). Beads were washed 3 times in lysis buffer and 1 time in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to elute bound proteins. Eluates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. To control normalized amounts of immobilized GST and GST fusion proteins, duplicate inputs were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subsequently stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution. Protein Isolation and Immunoprecipitation—Whole-cell protein extraction and immunoprecipitation experiments were performed as previously described (24Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Google Scholar, 37Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J.V. Hunt T. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6551-6557Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein were incubated with specific antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture). Then, 20 μl of 50% v/v protein A-coupled Sepharose bead slurry was added and incubated under gentle agitation overnight at 4 °C. After three washes in lysis buffer, bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed on Western blots. Alternatively, one-half of the immunoprecipitates was used directly to assay deacetylase activity, whereas the second half was mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on Western blots. Isolation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Protein Fractions—To separate nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins cells were lysed in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). After homogenization by passing the suspension through a 20-gauge syringe needle and control of efficiency by phase contrast microscopy, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 8 min at 4 °C. The supernatant cytoplasmic extract was transferred to a fresh tube. To obtain nuclear proteins, nuclei were resuspended in 1 volume of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min under agitation. The nuclear extract was then cleared from debris by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Histone Deacetylase Activity Assays—Histone deacetylase activity was measured as previously described (24Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Google Scholar, 38Lechner T. Lusser A. Brosch G. Eberharter A. Goralik Schramel M. Loidl P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 181-188Google Scholar). In short, protein extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with 5 μl of [3H]acetate-labeled chicken erythrocyte histones in a total volume of 30 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture) for 1 h at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 36 μl of 1 m HCl, 0.4 m acetate, and released acetate was extracted with 800 μl of ethyl acetate. After centrifugation at 8400 × g for 5 min, 600 μl of the organic phase were counted in 3 ml of toluene liquid scintillation mixture. Western Blot Analysis and Indirect Immunofluorescence—Protein extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After incubation with specific antibodies, the proteins were detected with the ECL kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Subcellular localization of HDAC1 and REA was determined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 135TV microscope and Leica TCS NT confocal microscope) as previously described (30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar). Nuclear DNA was visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or TOTO-3 (Molecular Probes Inc.). Luciferase Reporter Assays—SV40 thymidine kinase minimal promoter/Gal4-luciferase reporter constructs and Gal4-DBD fusion mammalian expression vectors were generous gifts from D. Eberhard and have been described previously (39Eberhard D. Jimenez G. Heavey B. Busslinger M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2292-2303Google Scholar). For luciferase reporter assays cells were grown and transfected in 6-well tissue culture dishes. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed by incubation in 200 μl of luciferase assay buffer (25 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.54 mm sodium tripolyphosphate, 16.3 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 0.1% Triton, 5.6 mm dithiothreitol; 1.2 mm ATP, 46 μm luciferin). Luciferase levels were measured using a Mediators Photoluminometer. Transfection efficiency was assessed by measuring β-galactosidase levels in an 80-μl aliquot of the cell lysate using an o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside-based liquid assay. Additionally, an aliquot of each extract was analyzed on Western blots to evaluate the levels of co-expressed proteins. REA Interacts with HDAC1 in the Yeast Two-hybrid System—The class I enzyme HDAC1 is present within three large multi-protein complexes, referred to as the SIN3, NuRD (for review, see Ref. 5Ahringer J. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 351-356Google Scholar), and CoREST complexes (7Humphrey G.W. Wang Y. Russanova V.R. Hirai T. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6817-6824Google Scholar). Specificity for target genes may be conferred by the composition of the HDAC-containing complexes. For this reason, we were interested in identifying additional HDAC1-interacting proteins. Pilot experiments indicated that high expression of full-length HDAC1 protein fused to a DNA binding domain significantly impaired the viability of yeast. 2J. Taplick, V. Kurtev, and C. Seiser, unpublished data. Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using a truncated mouse HDAC1 protein (aa 299-482) as bait with cDNA libraries from human HeLa cells and mouse embryos. Yeast colonies harboring HDAC1-interacting proteins were identified by their inducible viability on media lacking leucine and increased transcription from the lacZ gene. In this manner, we repeatedly identified the repressor of REA (32Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Google Scholar) as an HDAC1-interacting protein in both the human and the murine cDNA libraries. Sequencing of the corresponding cDNAs revealed that they encode truncated versions of REA encompassing amino acids 89-299 and 103-299 of the human and mouse proteins, respectively. Mouse REA was first identified as the murine B-cell receptor-associated protein 37 (mBAP37), a protein originally isolated through its physical association with the B lymphocyte IgM antigen receptor (34Terashima M. Kim K.M. Adachi T. Nielsen P.J. Reth M. Kohler G. Lamers M.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3782-3792Google Scholar). Complete sequencing of the murine open reading frame revealed that the encoded mouse REA displays 100% identity with the human REA protein (data not shown). The interaction of HDAC1 with REA was confirmed by back-crossing. Freshly transformed S. cerevisiae strain EGY191 expressing REA (aa 89-299) as bait, and HDAC1 (aa 299-482) as prey showed inducible viability on media lacking leucine (Fig. 1A). In contrast, transformants expressing an unrelated bait protein (LexA-bicoid) or the LexA DNA binding domain alone were not viable under these conditions, thus confirming the specificity of the HDAC1/REA interaction. These results were complemented by the analysis of lacZ transcription levels (Fig. 1B), which showed an ∼6-fold induction of β-galactosidase activity in strains co-expressing REA (89-299) and LexAHDAC1 (299-482) when compared with the LexA DNA binding domain or the unrelated control LexA-bicoid. Expression and Intracellular Localization of REA—We first looked at the expression pattern of REA in a variety of tissues and cell lines. 32P-Labeled REA cDNA was hybridized to a Clontech Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different mouse tissues. REA mRNA was detectable in several tested tissues, with very high expression in heart, liver, kidney, and to a lower extent, testis (Fig. 1C). HDAC1 mRNA was detected at high levels in testis and kidney and at lower levels in all other tissues tested with the exception of skeletal muscle. To analyze REA protein expression, we raised an REA-specific polyclonal antiserum using bacterially expressed, purified His6-tagged REA protein (aa 89-299). Specificity of the REA antiserum was confirmed by Western blot analysis and further enhanced by affinity purification against the antigen (data not shown). This affinity-purified antibody detected a single band corresponding to a 37-kDa protein in Western blots of whole cell protein extracts from a variety of established human and mouse cell lines (Fig. 1D). Among those tested were the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF-7. Mouse cell lines analyzed for REA expression were the interleukin-2-dependent T cell line B6.1 and primary erythroblasts as well as embryonic stem cells derived from HDAC1 wild type and homozygous mutant mice. In addition, a signal at 37 kDa was also detected in whole cell protein extracts from rat embryonic fibroblasts, indicating reactivity of the antibody for human, mouse, and rat species. HDAC1 protein was present in all cell lines tested, with the exception of the HDAC1 -/- ES cells. To establish further the connection between REA and the nuclear enzyme HDAC1, we next determined the subcellular localization of the REA protein. A putative nuclear localization sequence (aa 86-89) has been found through analysis of the polypeptide sequence (32Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Google Scholar); however, to our knowledge, direct evidence for the presence of REA within the nucleus is lacking. Using the affinity-purified REA antibody, we analyzed the subcellular localization of REA in logarithmically growing MCF-7 cells by confocal microscopy. REA was present in a distinct speckled pattern throughout the cell, with denser signals within the area of the nucleus (Fig. 2A, upper panel). A similar REA distribution pattern was observed in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Fig. 2A, lower panel) and HeLa cells (data not shown). Our data indicate that a subpopulation of REA shares its subcellular localization with the strictly nuclear HDAC1 (24Bartl S. Taplick J. Lagger G. Khier H. Kuchler K. Seiser C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5033-5043Google Scholar, 30Taplick J. Kurtev V. Kroboth K. Posch M. Lechner T. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 27-38Google Scholar). REA was reported to display increased association with estrogen receptor α (ERα) in the presence of the antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen (32Montano M.M. Ekena K. Delage Mourroux R. Chang W. Martini P. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6947-6952Google Scholar). We were, therefore, interested in knowing whether treatment of MCF-7 cells with the hormone would lead to a re-distribution of REA within the cell. Confocal immunofluorescence studies of MCF-7 cells treated for various periods of time with 10-6m 17β-estradiol or 10-6m 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen showed that REA signal intensity and distribution remained unaffected by the presence of ligand (data not shown). In a separate approach we analyzed the intracellular localization of REA by Western blot analysis of biochemically fractionated cell extracts. Logarithmically growing MCF-7 cells were harvested and used to prepare cytoplasmic versus nuclear extracts (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Sequential probing with antibodies specific for REA and HDAC1 confirmed that a significant portion of REA was present in the nuclear fraction, coincident with the localization of HDAC1 (Fig. 2B).

In skeletal muscle, TEF-1 factors interact with a skeletal muscle-specific cofactor called Vestigial-like 2 (Vgl-2) that is related to the Drosophila protein Vestigial. Here, we characterize Vgl-4, the only member of the Vestigial-like family expressed in the heart. Unlike other members of the Vgl family that have a single TEF-1 interaction domain called the tondu (TDU) motif, Vgl-4 has two TDU motifs in its carboxyl-terminal domain. Like other Vgl factors, Vgl-4 physically interacts with TEF-1 in an immunoprecipitation assay. Vgl-4 functionally interacts with TEF-1 and also with myocyte enhancer factor 2 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Overexpression of Vgl-4 in cardiac myocytes interfered with the basal expression and α1-adrenergic receptor-dependent activation of a TEF-1-dependent skeletal α-actin promoter. In cardiac myocytes cultured in serum and in serum-free medium, a myc-tagged Vgl-4 protein was located in the nucleus and cytoplasm but was exported from the nucleus when cells were treated with α1-adrenergic receptor agonist. A chimeric nuclear-retained Vgl-4 protein inhibited α1-adrenergic receptor-dependent activation. In contrast, deletion of the TDU motifs of Vgl-4 prevented Vgl-4 nuclear localization, relieved Vgl-4 interference of basal activity, and enhanced α1-adrenergic up-regulation of the skeletal α-actin promoter. Nuclear export of Vgl-4 is dependent on the nuclear exportin CRM-1. These results suggest that Vgl-4 modulates the activity of TEF-1 factors and counteracts α1-adrenergic activation of gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac and skeletal muscle genes are regulated by the transcriptional enhancer factor (TEF-1) family of transcription factors.

These results suggest that Vgl-4 modulates the activity of TEF-1 factors and counteracts α1-adrenergic activation of gene expression in cardiac myocytes. Differentiation of cardiac and skeletal muscle from pluripotent embryonic stem cells requires the selective activation of a limited number of transcription factors that drive the expression of many genes that confer the tissue-specific phenotype. The transcriptional enhancer factor-1 (TEF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: TEF-1, transcriptional enhancer factor-1; Vgl, Vestigial-like; TDU, tondu; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2.1The abbreviations used are: TEF-1, transcriptional enhancer factor-1; Vgl, Vestigial-like; TDU, tondu; MEF2, myocyte enhancer factor 2. family of transcription factors is required for muscle-specific gene activation. TEF-1 was identified from the characterization of the cardiac troponin T promoter. Cardiac troponin T is expressed in fetal skeletal muscle and in cardiac muscle. Mutation analysis of the cardiac troponin T promoter showed that the MCAT element (originally defined as a muscle-specific cytidine-adenosine-thymidine sequence, 5′-CATTCCT-3′) is required for high levels of promoter activity in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (1Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6404-6408Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 2Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similar MCAT elements have been characterized in a large number of skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific promoters (3Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K.G. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The transcription factor that binds to this element was identified as the SV40 enhancer-binding factor TEF-1 (4Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TEF-1 is expressed in many tissues (5Stewart A.F.R. Richard III, C.W. Suzow J. Stephan D. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C. Adra C.N. Genomics. 1996; 37: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and TEF-1 has also been implicated in placenta-specific enhancer function (6Jiang S.-W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10384-10392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jacquemin P. Oury C. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism whereby TEF-1 confers tissue specificity to an MCAT-bearing promoter has been ascribed to the interaction of TEF-1 with tissue-specific cofactors. For example, both the human placental lactogen promoter (6Jiang S.-W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10384-10392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jacquemin P. Oury C. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the β-myosin heavy chain promoter (8Tsika R.W. McCarthy J. Karasseva N. Ou Y. Tsika G.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C1761-C1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Huey K.A. Haddad F. Qin A.X. Baldwin K.M. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C738-C748Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) contain MCAT elements and are TEF-1-dependent for their specific expression in placenta and muscle, respectively. Thus, placenta- and muscle-specific TEF-1 cofactors must confer tissue-specific activity of TEF-1-dependent promoters. Studies in Drosophila have identified an important role for a cofactor of the TEF-1 homologue scalloped during wing and flight muscle differentiation (10Bate M. Rushton E. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1993; 316: 1047-1061PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sudarsan V. Anant S. Guptan P. VijayRaghavan K. Skaer H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This cofactor, called Vestigial, is critical for the development and patterning of the wing: loss of Vestigial results in a failure of wing development, and ectopic expression of Vestigial in tissues of the eyes, legs, and antennae leads to the development of ectopic wing tissue (12Kim J. Sebring A. Esch J.J. Kraus M.E. Vorwerk K. Magee J. Carroll S.B. Nature. 1996; 382: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 13Halder G. Polaczyk P. Kraus M.E. Hudson A. Kim J. Laughon A. Carroll S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3900-3909Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Binding of Vestigial switches the DNA target selectivity of the Scalloped protein (14Halder G. Carroll S.B. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar) and activates many wing and flight muscle-specific genes. These studies suggest that Vestigial acts as a selector protein controlling tissue-specific gene activation during organogenesis. We and others have identified mammalian homologues of Vestigial (14Halder G. Carroll S.B. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 17Mielcarek M. Günther S. Kruger M. Braun T. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S269-S274Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The first human homologue of Vestigial was named Tondu (the French word for “shaved”), perhaps because it could partially rescue the wing phenotype caused by a null mutation in Drosophila Vestigial (15Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a Northern blot of fetal human tissues, Tondu was found to be expressed in the kidney and lung, but not in the brain or the heart (15Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tondu was shown to physically and functionally interact with TEF-1 through a conserved sequence called the tondu (TDU) motif. We also identified this factor but named it Vestigial-like (Vgl)-1. Northern blot analysis of adult human tissues showed that it is expressed almost exclusively in the placenta (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We identified two other genes that bear a TDU motif and called them Vgl-2 and Vgl-3, although these proteins have little homology outside the TDU motif. Vgl-3 was also found to be placenta-specific. Thus, Vgl-1 and Vgl-3 likely contribute to the placenta-specific activity of TEF-1. In the adult, Vgl-2 was detected only in skeletal muscle. Vgl-2 is expressed in the myogenic cell line C2C12, and Vgl-2 mRNA levels increase during muscle differentiation. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we found that Vgl-2 also interacts with TEF-1 factors through its TDU motif. In addition, we found that Vgl-2 uses the TDU motif to interact with the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor (MEF) 2 (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Vgl-2 activated a TEF-1-dependent promoter and a MEF2-dependent promoter in myotubes, but not in myoblasts. By in situ hybridization in fetal mice, Vgl-2 mRNA appeared in early muscle precursors together with the myogenic differentiation factor myogenin (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Vgl-2 with MyoD, another myogenic differentiation factor, enhanced MyoD-induced muscle differentiation of 10T½ cells with a 7-fold increase in myosin heavy chain expression (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). From these functional properties, because Vgl-2 is skeletal muscle-specific and is expressed at the onset of skeletal muscle differentiation in the somitic myotome, Vgl-2 likely accounts for the skeletal muscle-specific function ascribed to TEF-1. However, a similar tissue-restricted member of the Vestigial-like family of cofactors had not been identified in the heart. Differentiation of cardiac muscle progenitor cells involves the selective activation of the GATA4 and Nkx2.5 transcription factors in pluripotent mesoderm (18Komuro I. Izumo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8145-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 19Kuo C.T. Morrisey E.E. Anandappa R. Sigrist K. Lu M.M. Parmacek M.S. Soudais C. Leiden J.M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). However, because mutation of TEF-1 binding sequences in the promoters of cardiac-specific genes causes a loss of tissue specificity (2Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4271-4283Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and because ablation of TEF-1 expression causes abnormal cardiac development and an embryonic lethal phenotype (21Chen Z. Friedrich G.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2293-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), these studies support a role for TEF-1 factors in cardiac development. In the adult, cardiac myocytes respond to growth-promoting stimuli by undergoing hypertrophy, rather than cell division. Although cardiac myocytes are considered to be terminally differentiated, hypertrophic signals such as the α1-adrenergic receptor agonist phenylephrine induce the expression of a number of genes characteristically expressed in the fetal heart (22Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and also partially reactivate specific components of the cell cycle machinery, including members of the E2F family of transcription factors (24Vara D. Bicknell K.A. Coxon C.H. Brooks G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21388-21394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and cyclin D (25Busk P.K. Bartkova J. Strom C.C.

Thus, myocytes transit through the G1-S phase of the cell cycle but appear unable to reenter a proliferative state. TEF-1 factors have been implicated in the activation of fetal genes in response to hypertrophic signals (22Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

If cardiac myocytes could be induced to dedifferentiate and reenter the cell cycle, this would represent an exploitable strategy to repair injured myocardium after myocardial infarction. Alternatively, expansion and modification of adult stem cells could also provide a means of regenerating injured tissue (30Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S.

In the present study, we characterized Vgl-4, a novel member of the Vgl family of TEF-1 cofactors. Vgl-4 was initially identified as a transcript expressed in an adult human myeloid leukemia bone marrow-derived stem cell line (31Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (199-210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Vgl-4 is the only Vgl member expressed in the heart. Unlike other members of the Vestigial family, Vgl-4 has two TDU motifs, suggesting that Vgl-4 might form a bridge between TEF-1 and MEF2 transcription factors. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis showed that Vgl-4 interacts with MEF2 and TEF-1. Overexpression of Vgl-4 in transient transfection assays in cardiac myocytes squelched a TEF-1-depedent skeletal α-actin promoter and interfered with its α1-adrenergic induction. Vgl-4 becomes localized to the cytoplasm with α1-adrenergic stimulation, suggesting that it is part of a dedifferentiated phenotype. Whereas the functional role of Vgl-4 in cardiac development remains to be elucidated, its interaction with and modulation of known cardiac and skeletal muscle transcription factors reveal a novel component of cardiac muscle differentiation. Expression Plasmids and Constructs—The full-length human (BQ932927) and mouse (BC048841) Vgl-4 cDNAs were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The human Vgl-4 cDNA was released from the pOTB7 plasmid using EcoRI and XhoI, labeled by random hexamer oligonucleotide priming, and used for Northern blot analysis of gene expression with a multi-tissue Northern blot (Clontech). The EcoRI/XhoI fragment was ligated into the human cytomegalovirus enhancer-driven expression vector pXJ40. To generate a myc-tagged Vgl-4 protein, the mouse Vgl-4 cDNA cloned in the pCMV-SPORT6 expression vector was released by a HindIII digest, filled-in with Klenow, and a XhoI digest. The fragment encoding amino acids 29–287 was ligated in-frame to a SmaI/XhoI-linearized pBluescript-myc tag vector to obtain the pBSmycVgl-4 vector. From the pBSmycVgl-4 vector, an NcoI/XhoI fragment encoding myc-tagged mouse Vgl-4 was ligated into the NcoI/XhoI-linearized pXJ40 expression vector to obtain the pXJmycVgl-4 vector. A chimeric construct bearing the amino-terminal domain of TEF-1 carrying the DNA-binding domain and nuclear localization signal fused to the mycVgl-4 cDNA sequence was obtained by ligating an EcoRI/filled-in BamHI fragment of TEF-1 in-frame to a filled-in NcoI/XhoI fragment of mycVgl-4 into an EcoRI/XhoI linearized pXJ40 vector. A mycVgl-4 expression construct lacking the TDU motifs was obtained by releasing and filling-in a SapI/XhoI digest of pXJmycVgl-4, thereby deleting the carboxyl terminus from amino acid 192. For the mammalian two-hybrid analysis, the pG5-luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) was used. The pMTEF-1 vector (containing the coding sequence for the yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to the human TEF-1 cDNA encoding amino acids 168–426) and the pMMEF2 vector (containing GAL4 DNA-binding sequence fused to the full-length MEF2C sequence) have been described previously (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The pVP16 vector (encoding the activation domain of the herpes simplex virus VP16 protein) was linearized with MluI and PstI. A BssHII/PstI fragment of the human Vgl-4 cDNA encoding amino acids 113–296 of the carboxyl terminus of Vgl-4 was ligated in-frame to the MluI/PstI-linearized pVP16 vector to generate the pVPVgl-4 vector. The pVPVgl-4ΔTDU vector, which lacked both TDU1 and TDU2, was obtained by filling in an EcoNI site and ligating to an Eco47III site in Vgl-4, thereby deleting the sequence coding for amino acids 207–273. The pVPVgl-4TDU1 vector was obtained by cloning a NaeI fragment coding for amino acids 153–232 of human Vgl-4 into the pVP vector at the filled-in BamHI site. The pVPVgl-4TDU2 vector was obtained by cloning a 3′ NaeI/HindIII fragment coding for amino acids 233–296 into the pVP vector between the filled-in EcoRI and the HindIII sites. All constructs were sequenced at the University of Pittsburgh core facility. In Vitro Translation and Co-immunoprecipitation—The pXJTEF-1 and pXJmycVgl-4 plasmids were transcribed with T7 polymerase and translated in vitro (Promega) to produce unlabeled full-length human TEF-1 and myc-tagged mouse Vgl-4 proteins. Incorporation of [35S]methionine was also used to produce radiolabeled proteins for immunoprecipitation. Reticulocyte lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Igepal CA-630 supplemented with protease inhibitors). Unlabeled mycVgl-4 was incubated with radiolabeled TEF-1 and immunoprecipitated using a rabbit anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and unlabeled TEF-1 protein was incubated with radiolabeled mycVgl-4 and immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-TEF-1 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA). Proteins were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried down, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized on a phosphor storage screen (Amersham Biosciences). Tissue Culture and Transfection—Neonatal rat cardiac myocytes were isolated as described previously (32Simpson P. J. Clin. Investig. 1983; 72: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), except that Worthington type II collagenase (5 mg/ml in Hank's balanced salt solution, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 1% glucose) was substituted for trypsin. Myocytes were cultured at low density (5 × 106 viable cells/well of a 6-well dish) in Hank's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and bromodeoxyuridine (100 μm) to prevent non-myocyte proliferation. Twenty-four h after plating, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 30 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method for 2 h with serum-containing medium, as described previously (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were rinsed several times, maintained in serum-free medium for 2 days, and harvested for the luciferase assay, as described previously (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Activities (mean ± S.E.) of the skeletal α-actin promoter were normalized to basal activity when co-transfected with empty pXJ40 expression vector and set at 1-fold. By independent sample t test, mean fold activities of the skeletal α-actin promoter response to phenylephrine in the presence of overexpressed TEF-1 transcription factors and the Vgl-4 cofactor were considered different from the response in the presence of empty expression vector at the p < 0.05 significance level. CV-1 fibroblasts maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.7 μg of the pG5-luciferase reporter (Promega) and 0.1 μg each of the pM and pVP expression vectors (Clontech) using LipofectAMINE™ reagent (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence detection of mycVgl-4, CV-1 cells and cardiac myocytes were plated and transfected on two-chamber collagen-coated glass slides. Cells were permeabilized and fixed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The myc-tagged protein was detected using a c-myc (A-14) rabbit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and visualized with Cy2-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Myosin heavy chain was revealed using MF20 mouse monoclonal antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma bank, University of Iowa) visualized with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mg/ml; Roche Applied Science). Vgl-4 was identified in the SMART (Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool; smart.ox.ac.uk/) data base as a protein containing two tandem TDU motifs (Fig. 1). A putative nuclear export signal and binding site for interaction with the nuclear exportin CRM-1 having the consensus sequence LX1–3 LX2–4LXL (33Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) was also identified in Vgl-4. Originally described as a putative protein encoded by a cDNA (KIAA0121) isolated from a human bone marrow stem cell-derived cell line (31Nagase T. Seki N. Tanaka A. Ishikawa K. Nomura N. DNA Res. 1995; 2 (199-210): 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), Vgl-4 is unique among the Vgl family of cofactors in that its expression is not tissue-restricted in the adult human (Fig. 2). Whereas Vgl-1 and Vgl-3 are largely placenta-enriched and Vgl-2 is skeletal muscle-specific (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Vgl-4 is expressed in the heart, kidney, and brain as well as in other tissues at lower levels.Fig. 2Northern blot analysis of Vgl-4 expression in human tissues. A human multi-tissue Northern blot with 1 μg mRNA/lane was probed for Vgl-4 expression. Vgl-4 expression was highest in the heart, kidney, and brain. Position of size markers is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the two TDU motifs diverge from those previously described for other members of the Vgl family (Fig. 1B), we tested whether Vgl-4 could also interact with TEF-1 (Fig. 3). Functional interaction between TEF-1 and Vgl-4 was observed by two-hybrid analysis in transiently transfected CV-1 cells (Fig. 3A; p < 0.001), and physical interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3B). In addition, like Vgl-1 and Vgl-2 (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), Vgl-4 interacts with MEF2 (Fig. 3A; p < 0.001). Interestingly, when half the pMTEF-1 and half the pMMEF2 vectors were both expressed with pVP-Vgl-4, a stronger interaction was observed than with pMTEF-1 and pMMEF2 vector alone (p < 0.0001). On the other hand, Vgl-1 contains a single TDU motif, and when pVP-Vgl-1 was similarly co-expressed with pMTEF-1 and pMMEF2, enhanced interaction was not seen (data not shown), suggesting that the presence of tandem TDU motifs in Vgl-4 allows TEF-1 and MEF2 to bind to Vgl-4 at the same time. In-frame deletion of both TDU motifs in Vgl-4 prevents Vgl-4 interaction with TEF-1 and MEF2 (Fig. 4). Although TDU1 preferentially interacted with TEF-1 (Fig. 4A), and TDU2 preferentially interacted with MEF2 (Fig. 4B), neither TDU motif alone was sufficient to restore full interaction with TEF-1 or MEF2.Fig. 4The TDU motifs are required for Vgl-4 interaction with TEF-1 and MEF2. Using the mammalian two-hybrid assay in CV-1 cells, an in-frame deletion of the TDU motifs in human Vgl-4 prevents its interaction with TEF-1 (A) and MEF2 (B). The TDU1 motif weakly interacted with TEF-1 (A), but not with MEF2 (B). In contrast, the TDU2 motif did not interact with TEF-1 (A) but interacted weakly with MEF2 (B). All values, n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To directly test whether the interaction between Vgl-4 and TEF-1 modulates the transcriptional activity of TEF-1, we used the mammalian two-hybrid assay in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5). Vgl-4 alone does not affect the expression of the GAL4-dependent promoter (compare pM/pVP with pM/pVPVgl-4). When fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain, TEF-1 is a moderately strong transcriptional activator of a heterologous GAL4-dependent promoter, pG5-luciferase, in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 5, pMTEF-1), but not in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3), as reported previously (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). α1-Adrenergic signaling increases reporter gene expression in the presence of GAL4/TEF-1 (pMTEF-1), but not in the presence of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain alone (pM). Thus, α1-adrenergic signaling increases TEF-1 transcriptional activity. Interaction between Vgl-4 and TEF-1 was also observed in cardiac myocytes (compare pMTEF-1/pVP with pMTEF-1/pVPVgl-4; p < 0.01), as it was in CV-1 cells (Fig. 3). However, in the presence of Vgl-4, the α1-adrenergic signaling-mediated potentiation of TEF-1 function was prevented (Fig. 5, compare pMTEF-1/pVPVgl-4 with pMTEF-1/pVPVgl-4/PE; p < 0.02). To determine how Vgl-4 modulates the α1-adrenergic signaling-mediated potentiation of TEF-1 function, a myc-tagged Vgl-4 protein was expressed in cardiac myocytes by transient transfection. In cardiac myocytes cultured in 5% fetal bovine serum or in serum-free medium, mycVgl-4 was localized predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 6, A and C). However, 24 h after phenylephrine stimulation, mycVgl-4 was predominantly exported to the cytoplasm, and little signal remained in the nuclei of cultured cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6E). To determine how Vgl-4 regulates gene expression in cardiac myocytes, the effect of Vgl-4 overexpression was tested on a TEF-1-dependent α-skeletal actin promoter (Fig. 7). Vgl-4 overexpression lowered the basal activity of the α-skeletal actin promoter (p < 0.01), suggesting that Vgl-4 is a negative modulator of TEF-1. The α-skeletal actin gene is up-regulated by the α1-adrenergic receptor-selective agonist phenylephrine up to 6-fold (Fig. 7). The response of the skeletal α-actin promoter to phenylephrine was blunted by TEF-1 overexpression (p < 0.01), by Vgl-4 overexpression (p < 0.02), or when Vgl-4 was co-expressed with TEF-1 (p < 0.0001). Taking into account that Vgl-4 is largely exported from the nucleus of phenylephrine-treated cardiac myocytes (Fig. 6), the ability of Vgl-4 overexpression to abrogate the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter might be enhanced if it were made to remain in the nucleus. To test whether a strong nuclear localization signal could override phenylephrine-mediated nuclear export of Vgl-4, a chimeric protein was generated using the nuclear localization signal of TEF-1 fused to mycVgl-4. This chimeric protein, TEF(N)-mycVgl-4, is not exported from the nucleus of cardiac myocytes treated with phenylephrine (Fig. 8, C and D). When tested on the skeletal α-actin promoter, the chimeric protein that is resistant to nuclear export nearly ablated the α1-adrenergic response (Fig. 7). On the other hand, deleting the carboxyl-terminal domain of Vgl-4 containing both TDU motifs caused cytoplasmic retention of Vgl-4 (Fig. 8, E and F) and markedly increased the α1-adrenergic up-regulation of the skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7). To determine whether the mechanism that regulates nuclear shuttling of Vgl-4 in cardiac myocytes requires the nuclear exportin CRM-1, as suggested by the presence of a putative nuclear export signal (Fig. 1), cardiac myocytes treated with phenylephrine were also treated with the CRM-1 inhibitor leptomycin B (Fig. 9). Leptomycin B blocked nuclear export of Vgl-4 in phenylephrine-treated cardiac myocytes. In the present study, we have identified Vgl-4 as a novel member of the Vgl family of transcription cofactors. Vgl-4 is expressed in several tissues, with the highest expression seen in the heart, followed by the kidney and brain (Fig. 2). This is the first member of the Vestigial family to be identified in the heart. Like other members of this family, united by the TDU motif, Vgl-4 interacts with TEF-1 and MEF2 in cultured cells. Thus, Vgl-4 joins a growing list of transcription factors and cofactors known to interact with TEF-1. Vgl-4 carries two TDU motifs required for the interaction with TEF-1 and MEF2, as supported by the two-hybrid analysis (Figs. 3 and 4). Vgl-4 may serve an important function bridging TEF-1 and MEF2 in cardiac muscle. The presence of two tandem TDU motifs in Vgl-4 is unique among vertebrate Vgl family members but is also seen in hypothetical proteins of Drosophila melanogaster (NP_648658) and Caenorhabditis elegans (AAK82912) that are distinct from Vestigial. However, the function of these other invertebrate Vestigial-like factors is not known. Interestingly, the first and second TDU motifs of the Drosophila protein are spaced farther apart and are different from each other (Fig. 1A), yet they show remarkable similarity to the equivalent TDU motifs in Vgl-4, suggesting that these motifs are conserved and may be functionally distinct. In support of this hypothesis, TDU1 and TDU2 showed selective interaction with TEF-1 and MEF2, respectively (Fig. 4). The existence of another protein in Drosophila bearing tandem TDU motifs points to a very ancient origin of the Vgl family. TEF-1 forms a multi-protein complex with other transcription factors including the histone-modifying enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (34Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the serum response factor (35Gupta M. Kogut P. Davis F.J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Gupta M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10413-10422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and MEF2 (36Maeda T. Gupta M.P. Stewart A.F.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 791-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Among transcriptional co-activators, the p160 proteins (37Belandia B. Parker M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30801-30805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), the Src/Yes-associated protein Yap65 (38Vassilev A. Kaneko K.J. Shu H. Zhao Y. DePamphilis M.L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), and Vgl-2 (16Maeda T. Chapman D.L. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48889-48898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) are able to augment transcription from an MCAT-dependent promoter. Unlike Vgl-2 in skeletal muscle, Vgl-4 appears to be a negative regulator of TEF-1-dependent gene expression in cardiac myocytes when tested on the TEF-1-dependent skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7) and on the β-myosin heavy chain promoter (data not shown). Similarly, Vgl-4 interfered with the activity of a MEF2-dependent myosin light chain promoter in cardiac myocytes (data not shown). Vgl-4 interference with TEF-1-dependent promoter activity under basal conditions suggests either that Vgl-4 itself is a negative cofactor or that Vgl-4 recruits a negative factor to TEF-1. If Vgl-4 is a negative cofactor, blocking its interaction with TEF-1 should have restored baseline skeletal α-actin promoter activity. If Vgl-4 recruits a negative factor to TEF-1, then blocking Vgl-4 interaction with TEF-1 would allow overexpressed mutant Vgl-4 to compete for binding to the negative factor with endogenous Vgl-4, relieve the inhibition of the TEF-1 complex, and further increase the baseline activity of the skeletal α-actin promoter. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, a carboxyl-terminal-truncated Vgl-4 lacking the TDU motifs augmented the basal activity of the skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7). The skeletal α-actin promoter is activated by α1-adrenergic stimulation, and this response requires TEF-1 transcription factors (23Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24346-24352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Previously, we observed a 3-fold activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter by α1-adrenergic stimulation (29Maeda T. Mazzulli J.R. Farrance I.K. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24346-24352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here, we found that the use of collagenase rather than trypsin during myocyte isolation markedly improved the response to phenylephrine, up to 6-fold (Fig. 7; data not shown). The phenylephrine response of the skeletal α-actin promoter in the presence of empty expression vector (pXJ40) reflects the increased activity of endogenous TEF-1 transcription factors (28Ueyama T. Zhu C. Valenzuela Y.M. Suzow J.G. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17476-17480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Maeda T. Mazzulli J.R. Farrance I.K. Stewart A.F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24346-24352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Consistent with our previous findings, TEF-1 overexpression inhibited the response to phenylephrine (27Stewart A.F.R. Suzow J. Kubota T. Ueyama T. Chen H.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that exogenous TEF-1 titrates limiting cofactors. Overexpression of Vgl-4 also attenuated the α1-adrenergic activation of the skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7). Vgl-4 may modulate TEF-1 by two possible mechanisms, either by recruiting a co-repressor to TEF-1, as under basal conditions, or by preventing α1-adrenergic modification of TEF-1. The two-hybrid analysis of the effects of Vgl-4 under basal and α1-adrenergic stimulation in cardiac myocytes supports either mechanism. Transcription of a heterologous promoter (pG5-luciferase) was activated by a GAL4 DNA-binding domain/TEF-1 fusion protein under basal conditions and was further activated in response to α1-adrenergic stimulation (Fig. 5). The ability of pMTEF-1 to further activate the pG5-luciferase reporter in response to α1-adrenergic stimulation was abolished in the presence of a chimeric protein containing the activation domain of VP16 fused to Vgl-4 (pVPVgl-4). Thus, Vgl-4 interferes with α1-adrenergic-mediated TEF-1 function. Nuclear localization of Vgl-1 depends on its interaction with TEF-1 because preventing Vgl-4 interaction with TEF-1 by deleting the TDU motifs caused cytoplasmic retention of Vgl-4 (Fig. 8). Interestingly, Vgl-4 moves out of the nucleus of cardiac myocytes treated with the α1-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine (Fig. 6), suggesting that Vgl-4 removal is required to promote the α1-adrenergic response. Forced nuclear retention of Vgl-4 in a chimeric construct carrying a strong nuclear localization signal (Fig. 8) markedly reduced the α1-adrenergic response of the skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7). Conversely, overexpression of a carboxyl-terminal-truncated Vgl-4 lacking the TDU motifs that is retained in the cytoplasm augmented the α1-adrenergic response of the skeletal α-actin promoter (Fig. 7). Overexpression of Vgl-4 likely overwhelms the nuclear export mechanism, and the presence of residual nuclear Vgl-4 could account for the interference of the α1-adrenergic response. Vgl-4 carries a consensus nuclear export signal (see Fig. 1A), a binding site of the nuclear exportin CRM-1 (33Fabbro M. Henderson B.R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our studies show that the CRM-1 inhibitor leptomycin B blocks nuclear export of Vgl-4 in phenylephrine-treated cardiac myocytes (Fig. 9). A CRM-1-dependent mechanism controlling nuclear localization of the cardiac transcription factor GATA4 in response to β-adrenergic signaling has been described previously (39Morisco C. Seta K. Hardt S.E. Lee Y. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28586-28597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase III prevents CRM-1 interaction with GATA4 and its nuclear export. During development, GATA4 regulates the expression of the cardiac-specific homeobox gene Nkx2.5 that controls cardiac myocyte differentiation (40Brown III, C.O. Chi X. Garcia-Gras E. Shirai M. Feng X.H. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10659-10669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). α1-Adrenergic signaling may unmask the nuclear export domain of Vgl-4 by phosphorylating the 14-3-3 site and thereby allow nuclear export through a CRM-1-dependent mechanism. α1-Adrenergic signaling is known to activate a fetal gene program and to partially reactivate components of the cell cycle in a process of cardiac myocyte dedifferentiation (22Kariya K. Farrance I.K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26658-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol.

Bartek J. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56: 64-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is important to note that the Drosophila Vestigial protein is required for cell proliferation in the wing primordium (41Martín-Castellanos C. Edgar B.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1003-1013PubMed Google Scholar, 42Paumard-Rigal S. Zider A. Vaudin P. Silber J. Dev. Genes Evol. 1998; 208: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), suggesting that members of the Vestigial family of transcription cofactors may participate in regulating the transition from proliferation to cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Thus, like GATA4, regulating the nuclear localization of Vgl-4 may play a role in cardiac myocyte differentiation. Although we do not yet know the genes that are regulated by Vgl-4 through their interaction with TEF-1 factors, one likely outcome of this interaction is a change in DNA binding specificity at muscle-specific promoters. In Drosophila, Vestigial interaction with Scalloped alters DNA binding specificity and activates many wing-specific genes (14Halder G. Carroll S.B. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 3295-3305PubMed Google Scholar) and allows the differentiation of indirect flight muscles (11Sudarsan V. Anant S. Guptan P. VijayRaghavan K. Skaer H. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whether Vgl-4 also affects TEF-1 target selectivity remains to be determined.

Two evolutionarily conserved multiprotein complexes, Crumbs-PALS1 (Stardust)-PATJ and Cdc42-Par6-Par3-atypical protein kinase C, have been implicated in the assembly of tight junctions and in polarization of Drosophila melanogaster epithelia. These two complexes have been linked physically and functionally by an interaction between PALS1 and Par6. Here we identify an evolutionarily conserved region in the amino terminus of PALS1 as the Par6 binding site and identify valine and aspartic acid residues in this region as essential for interacting with the PDZ domain of Par6. We have also characterized, in more detail, the amino terminus of Drosophila Stardust and demonstrate that the interaction mechanism between Stardust and Drosophila Par6 is evolutionarily conserved. Par6 interferes with PATJ in binding PALS1, and these two interactions do not appear to function synergistically.

Epithelial cells possess asymmetry with respect to the apicobasal axis reflected by the differential distribution of proteins and lipids in the apical and basolateral surfaces (1Roh M.H. Margolis B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F377-F387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Polarized mammalian epithelial cells have a tight junctional seal, which serves as a physical barrier that separates apical and basolateral membranes. It has been shown that proteins containing the PDZ (postsynaptic density-95/discs large/ZO-1) domain play an important role during cell polarization (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar), and multiple PDZ protein complexes are involved in the assembly and maintenance of tight junctions. One of the major groups of PDZ proteins is the membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein, which has one or more PDZ domains as well as an Src homology 3 domain and a noncatalytic guanylate kinase domain. Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila melanogaster have shown that membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein Stardust (Sdt) interacts with the transmembrane protein Crumbs (Crb) through its PDZ domain, and mutations in either Crb or Sdt cause polarity defects in Drosophila epithelia (3Tepass U. Knust E. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The mammalian homologue of Sdt is PALS1 (protein associated with Lin seven) (4Roh M.H. Makarova O Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Like Sdt, the PDZ domain of PALS1 binds the C-terminal tail of mammalian Crb isoforms, and PALS1 also interacts with a multi-PDZ domain protein, PATJ (PALS1-associated tight junction protein), through L27 (Lin-2 and Lin-7) domain dimerization (4Roh M.H.

Muecke S. Margolis B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 317-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Crb-PALS1-PATJ complex localizes to the tight junctions of mammalian epithelial cells, and the disruption of the complex leads to defects in cell polarity (6Straight S.W. Shin K. Fogg V.C. Fan S. Liu C.J. Roh M.H. Margolis B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similarly, the Drosophila PATJ homologue, formerly known as discs lost (Dlt) (7Bhat M.A. Izadoost S. Lu Y Cho K.O. Choi K.W. Bellen H.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 833-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 8Pielage J. Storke T. Bunse I. Klambt C. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), can interact with the L27 domain of Sdt. Therefore, the analogous complex in D. melanogaster is Crb-Sdt-PATJ. Another evolutionarily conserved tight junction complex is composed of PDZ proteins Par3, Par6, and aPKC and the GTP-loaded form of the small GTPase Cdc42 (9Wodarz A. Ramrath A. Grimm A. Knust E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1361-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 10Petronczki M. Knoblich J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 11Joberty G.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The Par3-Par6-aPKC complex is important for determining polarity in many cell types, including D. melanogaster neuroblasts, the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, and mammalian epithelial cells (12Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 13Wodarz A. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). Par6 also interacts with the active form of Cdc42 and Rac. Both its Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding domain (CRIB)-like motif and the adjacent PDZ domain are required for this interaction (11Joberty G. Petersen C. Gao L. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 12Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P. Mbamalu G. Scott J.D. Pawson T. Nat.

The Drosophila homologues of Par3, Par6, and aPKC are Bazooka, DmPar6, and DaPKC, respectively. They also form a complex and localize at the subapical region of the Drosophila epithelia (18, Knust, E., and Bossinger, O. Science 298, 1955-1959Google Scholar). The two tight junction complexes have been studied separately until recently, when they were connected by the interaction between PALS1 and Par6 (19Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It was shown that PALS1 and Par6 bind directly, and the interaction is between the PALS1 amino terminus and the CRIB and PDZ domains of Par6. PDZ domains usually recognize the extreme carboxyl terminus of binding partners, but they can also recognize an internal binding site if the site is presented in a β-finger structure that mimics the protein carboxyl terminus (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the PALS1-Par6 interaction. We found that the Par6 binding site in the PALS1 amino terminus and the interaction mechanism are conserved in the Sdt-DmPar6 interaction in D. melanogaster. We also studied the relationship between PALS1-PATJ interaction and PALS1-Par6 interaction, and our results indicate that the binding may be competitive rather than synergistic. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (Y11; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies were utilized for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting experiments. Mouse anti-GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; aa, amino acid(s); HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. antibody (Cell Signaling) was used to detect the GST fusion proteins in the GST pull-down experiments. Mouse monoclonal anti-Myc, rat monoclonal anti-ZO-1 (Chemicon), and rabbit polyclonal anti-PALS1 (4Roh M.H. Makarova O Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) antibodies were used in the immunostaining experiments. Cell Culture—MDCK type II cells and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 units of penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. MDCK Myc-PALS1 (wild type and V37G mutant) and HA-Par6B cell lines were maintained in media supplemented with 600 μg/ml G418 and 300 μg/ml hygromycin B, respectively. MDCK Stable Cell Lines—Early passage MDCK cells grown to ∼30% confluence on 10-cm plastic dishes were transfected with 5 μg of pRK5-Myc-PALS1 V37G or pHA3-Par6B DNA constructs together with 0.5 μg of pSV2neo (for G418 selection) or pTRE2hyg (for hygromycin B selection) empty vectors using Fugene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Transfected cells were replated in medium containing 600 μg/ml G418 or 600 μg/ml hygromycin B 48 h after transfection. Medium was changed every 2–3 days. After 12 days of selection, surviving clones were picked and screened for Myc-PALS1 V37G or HA-Par6B expression by immunostaining and Western blot. DNA Constructs—HA-Par6B, Myc-PALS1, GST-PALS1(1–181), and Myc-PATJ constructs were generated as previously described (4Roh M.H. Makarova O Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 19Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of HA-Par6, Myc-PALS1, GST-PALS1, and Myc-PATJ constructs were carried out as previously described (20Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). GST-tagged Stardust (residues 1–256) and HA-tagged DmPar6 were generated by PCR from Drosophila embryonic cDNA (Clontech) and cloned into pG-STag and pKH3 vectors, respectively. In identification of the Stardust U1 region, a 5′-end primer against the ECR1 and a 3′-end primer against the PDZ domain were used, and PCRs were carried out at the annealing temperatures of 50, 52, 54, and 56 °C. Only one specific product of 1.2 kb was obtained, and it was cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Blotting—Plasmids (3 μg for GST pulldown and 2 μg for coimmunoprecipitation or as indicated in the experiment) were transfected with Fugene6 reagent into HEK293 cells grown to 50% confluence on 10-cm dishes. After 48 h, cells were collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO5, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). HA-Par6 stable MDCK cells were grown to confluence on 10-cm dishes and collected in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer likewise. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C). For GST-PALS1 pull-downs, 10 μg of GST protein was used per experiment. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was performed as previously described (19Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Imaging—MDCK cells were seeded at a high density into the Lab-Tek II chamber slide system (Nalge Nunc). They were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in 1% SDS/PBS for 5 min, and blocked in 2% goat serum/PBS for 1 h. Chamber slides were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution (monoclonal anti-Myc 9E10 (1:1000), monoclonal anti-ZO-1 (1:400), monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (1:1600), and polyclonal anti-PALS1 (1:200) overnight in a humidified chamber at 30 °C. After extensive washes with PBS, chamber slides were incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1500 in blocking solution) for 2 h at 30 °C. Subsequently, chamber slides were washed three times with PBS and mounted with ProLong antifade regent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed at the University of Michigan Diabetes Center with an Olympus FluoView 500 scanning laser confocal microscope. PALS1 Interacts with Par6 through an Evolutionarily Conserved Region in Its Amino Terminus—It was previously shown that PALS1 interacts with Par6 through its amino-terminal region aa 1–181 (19Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), which consists of the U1 region (aa 1–120) and the L27N domain (aa 121–181) (Fig. 1A). The L27N domain mediates the PALS1-PATJ interaction by L27 domain heterodimerization with the L27 domain of PATJ, whereas the function of the PALS1 U1 region is largely unknown. We made further deletions in the PALS1 amino terminus and performed GST pull-down experiments to precipitate HA-Par6 expressed in HEK293 cells. We found that the first 20 amino acids of the U1 region are not required in this interaction, whereas the first 20 amino acids of the L27N domain are essential (data not shown). Thus, we determined the minimum binding region in PALS1 required for Par6 binding to be amino acids 21–140. We performed an alignment of the PALS1 amino terminus and found two regions conserved in PALS1 from human, mouse, zebrafish, and Drosophila PALS1 homologue, Stardust (Fig. 1B). We named these regions evolutionarily conserved region 1 and 2 (ECR1 and ECR2, respectively). A GST-PALS1(1–181) fusion protein with the ECR1 deleted cannot bind HA-Par6, whereas binding to Myc-PATJ is not affected (Fig. 1C). In contrast, deletion of the ECR2 region has no effect on Par6 binding. We also expressed the ECR1 peptide alone fused to GST, but this was not able to bind Par6. This indicates that the ECR1 region of PALS1 is necessary but not sufficient for Par6 binding. Point Mutations in the PALS1 ECR1 Reduce Interactions with Par6—To further characterize the Par6 binding site, we mutated each amino acid in the PALS1 ECR1. Hydrophobic residues were mutated to glycine, whereas the other residues were mutated to alanine. GST-PALS1(1–181) containing ECR1 point mutations were bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and their ability to precipitate HA-Par6 was tested. Two mutations, V37G and D38A, severely reduced the binding of Par6 (Fig. 2A). In contrast, point mutations in the PALS1 L27N domain, V150G and L154G, that abolish the interaction with PATJ had no effect on Par6 interactions. We next made more conservative mutations in Val-37 and Asp-38 by generating V37I and D38E and found near wild type binding of these two mutants to Par6 (Fig. 2A, bottom right panel). Similar experiments were also carried out in MDCK cells stably expressing HA-Par6. The GST-PALS1(1–181) V37G and D38A bound HA-Par6 poorly, whereas the V37I mutant and the D38E mutant had no significant effect on binding (Fig. 2B). Point mutations in the PALS1 L27N domain did not affect the interaction between PALS1 and Par6. Par6 Binding Site in Drosophila Stardust—We examined whether this Par6 binding site was functional in the PALS1 Drosophila homologue, Stardust. According to the published sequence (21Hong Y. Stronach B. Perrimon N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 2001; 414: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 22Bachmann A. Schneider M. Thellenberg E. Grawe F. Knust E. Nature. 2001; 414: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), Stardust has only one L27 domain and a much larger U1 region at its amino terminus when compared with PALS1 homologues from other species. In this large Stardust U1 region, there is one perfectly matched ECR1 and another region that is an imperfect match for an ECR1 region. There are also two ECR2 motifs. We designed a 5′-primer against the ECR1 and a 3′-primer against a conserved region in the PDZ domain and performed a PCR from Drosophila embryonic cDNA (0.5–12-h pool). A PCR product of 1.2-kb was obtained and the sequencing of this product reveals a much shorter U1 region of 256 aa. A 1299-bp fragment described in Stardust was missing from our PCR product, and this fragment is predicted to be an exon in the Drosophila genome data base (FlyBase, available on the World Wide Web at flybase.bio.indiana.edu). Using additional oligonucleotides from this region, we were unable to obtain a product containing this exon in any of our PCRs. Thus, we believe the predominant form of Stardust mRNA found in the embryo is the one shown in Fig. 3A. This U1 region (aa 1–256) of Drosophila Stardust was cloned and fused to GST. GST-Sdt(1–256) can bind HA-Par6 in a similar fashion to GST-PALS1(1–181), but it does not interact with PATJ because it does not contain an L27 domain (Fig. 3B). Val-19 and Asp-20 in the Stardust ECR1 were analogous to the crucial binding residues Val-37 and Asp-38 in the PALS1 ECR. Mutation of these residues in GST-Sdt(1–256) to V19G and D20A impaired binding to mammalian and Drosophila Par6 (DmPar6) (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that the same Par6 binding site exists in Stardust ECR1, and the mechanism of interaction between PALS1/Stardust and Par6 is likely to be conserved between Drosophila and the mammalian system. Interaction between the PALS1 ECR1 and Par6 CRIB-PDZ Domains—Previous results also showed that the PALS1-Par6 interaction is mediated by a region that covers both the semi-CRIB domain and the PDZ domain in Par6 (19Hurd T.W. Gao L. Roh M.H. Macara I.G. Margolis B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Since the Par6 semi-CRIB domain and PDZ domain can form an integral structure and interact with Cdc42 (23Garrard S.M. Capaldo C.T. Gao L. Rosen M.K. Macara I.G. Tomchick D.R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we wanted to test whether the Par6 semi-CRIB domain and PDZ domain also work coordinately to bind PALS1 or whether either one of them is sufficient for the interaction. Different Par6 deletion mutations were made and co-transfected into HEK293 cells with wild type Myc-PALS1 (Fig. 4A). Mutants with either the CRIB domain alone or PDZ domain alone cannot co-immunoprecipitate with Myc-PALS1, whereas the mutant with both domains present can interact with PALS1, although the interaction is not as strong as that of Par6 wild type (Fig. 4B). The V37A mutation was generated in full-length PALS1, and the mutant showed decreased interaction with Par6 wild type in a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. A Par6 point mutation, M235W, also resulted in weakened interactions with PALS1 wild type in a coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 4B). Par6 M235W alters a methionine residue in the PDZ binding pocket into a bulky tryptophan to block the PDZ domain-binding pocket, and this mutation abolishes the interaction between Par6 and the two mammalian lethal giant larvae isoforms (mLgl-1 and mLgl-2) (24Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). We noted that PALS1 V37G did not completely abolish binding with Par6, as was seen with GST-PALS1(1–181) V37G, so it is possible that there are other Par6 binding sites in PALS1 outside the aa 1–181 region. Also, we wanted to investigate the relationship between the PALS1 ECR1 and Par6 PDZ domain, so we co-transfected different PALS1 truncation mutants (Fig. 4A) with either Par6 wild type or Par6 M235W mutant and performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. PALS1(1–181) shows a dramatic decrease in binding to Par6 M235W like full-length PALS1, whereas the PALS1 ΔN only has residual interaction with both Par6 wild type and Par6 M235W. These coimmunoprecipitation results, together with the GST pulldown results in Fig. 2, suggest that the PALS1-Par6 interaction is through PALS1(1–181) and Par6 CRIB-PDZ domains, and the interaction between PALS1 ECR1 (the valine residue) and Par6 PDZ binding pocket is a major contributor to the binding between PALS1 and Par6. PALS1 V37G Mutant Is Localized to the Tight Junction—To determine the subcellular localization of the PALS1 V37G mutant, a MDCK cell line that stably expresses Myc-PALS1 V37G was generated. As shown in Fig. 5, Myc-PALS1 V37G mutant is localized at the tight junction as detected by Myc and PALS1 staining. It was co-localized with the tight junction marker ZO-1 and is above the adherens junction marker E-cadherin in the Z-section image (data not shown) just as the endogenous PALS1 did in the wild type MDCK cell line (4Roh M.H. Makarova O Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It was previously shown that the L27N domain of PALS1 is responsible for tight junction targeting, and deletion of just the U1 region did not disrupt the localization of PALS1 (4Roh M.H. Makarova O Liu C.J. Shin K. Lee S. Laurinec S. Goyal M. Wiggins R. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The V37G mutation in PALS1 U1 region does not affect the PALS1-PATJ interaction, and this probably explains the normal localization of this mutant in epithelial cells. Par6 Interferes with PATJ in Binding PALS1—A region of the PALS1 L27N domain is required for binding Par6, but the reason for this requirement is not clear. However, as shown in Fig. 2A, mutations in PALS1 L27N domain that abolish PALS1-PATJ binding do not affect the PALS1-Par6 binding; thus, we wanted to determine whether PALS1 and PATJ work synergistically to bind Par6 as seems to be suggested by studies in Drosophila (25Nam S.C. Choi K.W. Development. 2003; 130: 4363-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A constant amount of Myc-PATJ and increasing amounts of HA-Par6 were co-transfected into HEK293 cells, and the cell lysates were incubated with GST-PALS1(1–181)-agarose beads. With the increase of Par6 expression, there is an increase in Par6 binding to GST-PALS1(1–181) and a decrease in PATJ binding (Fig. 6). This result suggests that Par6-PALS1 binding can interfere with PATJ-PALS1 binding, and these two interactions do not work synergistically. In this report, we identified the Par6 binding site in the PALS1 amino-terminal region and showed that the same binding site also exists in Stardust, the Drosophila PALS1 homologue. The PALS1-Par6 binding is mainly mediated by the interaction between the binding site in the PALS1 ECR1 and the Par6 PDZ domain binding pocket. PDZ domains are intracellular modules that usually bind the extreme carboxyl terminus of a protein and also can recognize internal sites when that site is presented in a β-finger structure that mimics the protein carboxyl terminus (2Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). The β-finger structure is usually stabilized by disulfide bonds or salt bridges. In the case of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS)-syntrophin interaction, an Arg residue 9 aa downstream of the 0-position of the internal binding site in neuronal nitric-oxide synthase forms a salt bridge with the Asp residue and stabilizes the β-finger structure (26Hiller B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). We also found an Arg residue 9 aa downstream of Val-37 in PALS1 that is conserved among species, but the mutation of this Arg to Asp did not interfere with its binding to Par6 in GST pull-down experiments (data not shown). A recent report has shown that Drosophila Par6 and PATJ bind to each other directly and that the interaction is between the amino terminus of DmPar6 and the third PDZ domain of Dm-PATJ (25Nam S.C. Choi K.W. Development. 2003; 130: 4363-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We cotransfected HEK293 cells with mammalian Par6 and PATJ, and we did not see the coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins. However, we do not exclude the possibility of Par6-PATJ interaction in the process of polarization of MDCK cells, and this interaction may bring new complexity to the dynamic cooperation of the two tight junction complexes. The newly identified mLgl-Par6 interaction shows similarities to the PALS1-Par6 interaction. It is mediated by binding of the amino-terminal region of mLgl, which contains several WD40 repeats, to the Par6 PDZ domain (24Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 27Plant P.J. Fawcett J.P. Lin D.C.C. Holdorf A.D. Binns K. Kulkarni S. Pawson T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 28Betschinger J. Mechtler K. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), and the Par6 M235W mutant cannot bind mLgl-1 or mLgl-2 (24Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). There is no detectable sequence homology between the mLgl amino terminus and PALS1 amino terminus, and there is no sequence similar to the PALS1 ECR1 found in mLgl. However, the similarities of the two interactions suggest that further study of the mLgl-Par6 interaction will probably help to elucidate the mechanism of the PALS1-Par6 interaction and vice versa. There was a requirement for the PALS1 L27N domain in the interaction between Par6 and PALS1, yet its role is still not clear, since the Drosophila Stardust amino terminus lacking the L27 domain could still bind Par6 (Fig. 3B). We made a series of deletions in the Stardust U1 region and found that Sdt(1–194) bound Par6 as strongly as Sdt(1–256), and Sdt (1–154) still had substantial binding to Par6. Based on these findings, we speculate that the first 20 amino acids of the PALS1 L27N domain help the PALS1 U1 region fold into a proper structure when the protein is expressed as a GST fusion protein. Similarly, we would speculate that this L27 region is not required in Stardust because of the larger amino terminus that can fill this role. Previous circular dichroism study suggested that L27 domains are largely unfolded individually, but when associated with their heterodimerization partners they show a significant increase in helicity as well as a cooperative unfolding transition with increasing temperature (29Harris B.Z. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Lim W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34902-34908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We propose that PALS1 may have two conformational states in its amino terminus. In state 1, when PALS1 interacts with PATJ, the PALS1 L27N domain is fully folded, heterodimerizing with the PATJ L27 domain. In state 2, the PALS1 L27N domain is largely unfolded, and the first 20 amino acids of the L27N domain fold with the adjacent U1 region to form a structure to present the Par6 binding site in ECR1 to the Par6 PDZ domain. However, it is possible that the Par6 binding site is also properly presented when the PALS1 L27N domain is fully folded, but in this case PATJ binding and Par6 binding may interfere with each other due to steric hindrance. The fact that Stardust lacks the L27N domain but still can bind Par6 also suggests that PATJ does not promote the PALS1-Par6 interaction by forming a protein complex with the two, and since the PALS1 L27N domain is shared between the two interactions, it is reasonable to think that PALS1 does not interact with Par6 and PATJ at the same time. However, these studies were performed in HEK293 cells, and it is possible that such cooperative interactions may occur during polarization in MDCK cells. The true nature of these interactions will require additional studies, in particular structural analysis. Recently, Prehoda and co-workers (30Peterson F.C. Penkert R.R. Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) studied the structure of the PDZ domain of Drosophila Par6 bound to a carboxyl-terminal peptide ligand in the absence of Cdc42. A mutagenesis study of this carboxyl-terminal ligand suggested that the P0 residue and the P-1 residue are essential for the recognition of Par6 PDZ domain, whereas the P-2 residue was not important. This is in contrast to classic PDZ domain peptide interactions, where the P0 residue and the P-2 residue are essential. This could help explain why we found two adjacent residues in the PALS1 ECR1 that are important for Par6 interaction. Some of their data also supported the idea that the PALS1-Par6 interaction is mediated by the PDZ binding pocket of Par6. Overall, our studies indicate that the ECR1 region in PALS1 is essential for the interaction between the Par6 CRIB-PDZ region and PALS1. Our data also show an important role for the remainder of the U1 region, suggesting that the U1 region possibly folds into a specific tertiary structure to present the ECR1 motif to Par6. Structural studies will be necessary to confirm this speculation."
https://openalex.org/W2061130457,"Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor critical for key cellular processes, including immune response, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression. A yeast two-hybrid screening, using the Rel homology domain (RHD) of the p65 subunit (RelA) of NF-κB as bait, led to the isolation of PIAS3, previously identified as a specific inhibitor of STAT3. We show that PIAS3 can directly associate with p65 using an in vitro pull-down and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays. When overexpressed, PIAS3 inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription induced by treatment with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β or by overexpression of TNF family receptors such as RANK, TNFR1, and CD30 or signal transducers of TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Downregulation of PIAS3 by RNA interference reverses its effect on TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation. We found that an N-terminal region of PIAS3 is necessary for both the interaction with p65 and the transcriptional suppression activity. In addition, we found that an LXXLL coregulator signature motif located within the N-terminal region of PIAS3 is the minimal requirement for the interaction with p65. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PIAS3 interferes with p65 binding to the CBP coactivator, thereby resulting in a decreased NF-κB-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that PIAS3 may function in vivo as a modulator in suppressing the transcriptional activity of p65.

There are five known members of the mammalian NF-κB/Rel family: p65 (RelA), c-Rel, RelB, p50 (NF-κB1), and p52 (NF-κB2). These proteins share a conserved 300-amino acid region known as the Rel homology domain (RHD), which is responsible for DNA binding, dimerization, and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Google Scholar, 5Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Google Scholar). In most cells, Rel family members form hetero- and homodimers with distinct specificities in various combinations. p65, RelB, and c-Rel are transcriptionally active members of the NF-κB family, whereas p50 and p52 primarily serve as the DNA binding subunits (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Google Scholar, 5Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Google Scholar). The most widely studied and most abundant form of NF-κB is the heterodimer of p50 and p65. A common feature of the regulation of NF-κB is the sequestration in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex physically associated with a class of inhibitory molecules known as IκBs (7Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with a variety of inducers such as phorbol esters, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) results in phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of the IκB proteins (2Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 8Bours V. Bonizzi G. Bentires-Alj M. Bureau F. Piette J. Lekeux P. Merville M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 27-38Google Scholar, 9Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Google Scholar). The degradation of IκB proteins exposes the nuclear localization sequence in the remaining NF-κB dimers, which in turn leads to a rapid translocation of NF-κB to nucleus where it activates target genes by binding to cognate DNA regulatory elements (4May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Google Scholar, 5Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Google Scholar, 6Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Google Scholar). A recent work has shown that NF-κB-dependent transcription requires the function of transcriptional coactivator proteins (10Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Google Scholar, 11Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Google Scholar, 12Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Google Scholar). The CBP and its homologue, p300, are coactivators that interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB to enhance its ability to activate transcription. Inducible phosphorylation of p65 by the protein kinase A catalytic subunit stimulates NF-κB-dependent gene expression by enhancing the interaction of p65 with CBP (13Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar, 14Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Google Scholar). Two other coactivators are also known to be involved in regulating the transactivation function of NF-κB. The HAT function of the p/CAF coactivator was shown to be required for the activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (15Sheppard K.A. Rose D.W. Haque Z.K. Kurokawa R. McInerney E. Westin S. Thanos D. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6367-6378Google Scholar), and the SRC-1 coactivator protein was shown to interact with the p50 subunit of NF-κB to potentiate NF-κB-mediated transactivation (16Na S.Y. Lee S.K. Han S.J. Choi H.S. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10831-10834Google Scholar). Thus, interaction with transcriptional coactivators is important in mediating the transactivation potential of NF-κB. Moreover, the differential association of NF-κB with coactivator proteins and possibly with corepressor proteins in unstimulated cells as well as in cells in which NF-κB has been activated is likely to determine the level of activation or repression of NF-κB-regulated genes (17Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Google Scholar, 18Ashburner B. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7065-7077Google Scholar, 19benezra M. Chevallier N. Morison D. MacLachlan T.K. El-Deiry W.S. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26333-26342Google Scholar). Although the requirement of coactivators for transcriptional activation by NF-κB is well established, little work has been done to determine the importance of repressors in regulating NF-κB transactivation. To gain more insights into negative regulation of NF-κB-activity, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and found PIAS3 as a potential binding partner for p65. We provide evidence that PIAS3 exerts a strong inhibitory effect on NF-κB-dependent transactivation through binding to the Rel domain of p65. Additionally, we found that the interaction between p65 and PIAS3 requires the LXXLL motif of N-terminal PIAS3. Moreover, we show that PIAS3 negatively regulates NF-κB-dependent transcription by interfering with the ability of the CBP coactivator to interact with p65. Plasmids and Antibodies—pSos-p65-(1-313) containing the N-terminal RHD of p65, the bait plasmid for the Cytotrap yeast two-hybrid screen, was generated by inserting the p65 N-terminal region corresponding to amino acids 1-313 into pSos (Stratagene). To generate bacterial expression vectors for GST-p65N (aa 1-313) and GST-p65C (aa 314-551), the corresponding p65 cDNA fragments were generated by PCR and cloned in-frame into pGEX-5x-1 (Amersham Biosciences). A full-length murine PIAS3 cDNA was obtained by PCR from a cDNA library of T cell hybridoma KMls-8.3.5 (20Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Google Scholar). FLAG epitope-tagged PIAS3 cDNAs (PIAS3 wt (aa 1-584), PIAS3-N (aa 1-391), and PIAS3-C (aa 391-584)) were generated by PCR amplifying corresponding fragment from the full-length PIAS3 cDNA and subsequently cloning into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma). FLAG epitope-tagged PIAS3 LL-AA mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). To generate eukaryotic expression vectors for the GSTCBP-(1-450) mutant, CBP cDNA fragment encoding the corresponding N-terminal region was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into pEBG vectors as described previously (21Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of all constructs obtained by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NF-κB reporter vector (κB)3-interferon-luciferase and pCMV-β-gal plasmids have been described previously (22Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Kandala G. Liou M.-L. Liou H.C. Choi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 93: 9699-9703Google Scholar). The c-Jun (pFA-Jun) pathway-specific transactivators, the GAL4 UAS-containing luciferase reporter (pFR-Luc) plasmid, and the MEKK (pFC-MEKK) expression vectors were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Expression constructs encoding RANK, TNFR1, CD30, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 have been described previously (21Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Google Scholar, 23Wong B.R.

The antibody (Ab) specific for phosphorylated IκB-α was from New England Biolabs; anti-IκBα (C-21), anti-p65 (C-20), anti-PIAS3 (H-169), and anti-CBP (A-22) Abs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and the anti-FLAG epitope Ab (M2) was from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The CytoTrap™ (Stratagene) yeast screening was performed with murine thymus cDNA library (Stratagene) as prey and pSos-p65-(1-313) as the bait according to the manufacturer's instructions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain cdc25H was transformed sequentially with pSos-p65-(1-313) and murine thymus cDNA library fused to the pMyr plasmid containing the myristylation sequence of v-Src. Because the cdc25H yeast cell contains a temperature-sensitive mutant of the yeast homologue (cdc25H) of human hSos, it cannot grow at 37 °C. Positive clones were selected by the ability of cdc25H cells to grow on galactose plate at 37 °C. The hSos-p65-(1-313) protein is recruited to the plasma membrane because of the interaction with the myristoylated protein encoded by a pMyr clone selected from the target library, thereby complementing the cdc25 defect and allowing the growth of the cdc25H yeast clone at 37 °C due to activation of the Ras-signaling pathway. The pMyr plasmids were rescued from positive colonies and identified by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen). The cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well dish 1 day prior to transfection by calcium phosphate method as previously described (21Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Google Scholar). Each transfection was done using an equal amount of total DNA by adding appropriate amount of the control vector, pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). At 36-h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and the whole cell extracts were prepared for the luciferase assay. The luciferase activity was measured by the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity as described previously (21Lee S.Y. Lee S.Y. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1275-1285Google Scholar). The data are obtained from three independent transfections and presented as the -fold increase in luciferase activities (means ± S.D.) relative to the control. Recombinant human TNF-α and IL-1β were purchased from R&D Systems. Immunoprecipitations and Western Blot Analysis—To examine the protein-protein interaction in cultured 293T cells, subconfluent plates were transfected with 2-7 μg of the indicated combinations of expression vectors by calcium phosphate method. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG Ab, anti-p65 Ab, or anti-CBP Ab for 3 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected by incubation (1 h, 4 °C) with protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science). After extensive washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by 6-10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG, anti-p65, or anti-CBP Abs. Membranes were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For endogenous immunoprecipitations, mouse T cell hybridoma KMls-8.3.5 cells (20Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Google Scholar) were lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated with polyclonal anti-p65 Ab or IgG as a control. Western blotting for detection of endogenous PIAS3 and endogenous p65 was performed with polyclonal anti-PIAS3 and anti-p65 Abs, respectively. Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and GST Binding Assay—GST-p65 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE) (Novagen) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as specified by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins (2 μg) immobilized on the beads were used for binding assay. Cell lysates transfected with FLAG epitope-tagged PIAS3 DNA were incubated with either GST or GST-p65 fusion proteins for 3 h at 4 °C in the 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Samples were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western analysis using enhanced chemiluminescence. RNA Interference—Custom SMARTpool plus small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target human PIAS3 (catalog no. M-004164-00-05) was designed and synthesized by Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA (5 nmol) was transfected into MCF-7 cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 48 h after transfection, the cells were treated with TNF-α for 6 h and lysed for NF-κB-luciferase reporter assay. A nonspecific RNA duplex (Dharmacon, catalog no. D-001130-01-05) was used in control experiments. The relative expression of endogenous PIAS3 was monitored by Western blotting of cell extracts isolated from control or siRNA-treated cells, using a polyclonal antibody against PIAS3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Identification of PIAS3 as a Novel p65-interacting Partner Using Yeast Two-hybrid System—We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with NF-κB p65. The cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1-313 of p65, containing the Rel homology domain, was used as bait. We screened ∼1.5 million transformants from the mouse thymus cDNA library. One of the isolated clones encoded the C-terminal region of the PIAS3 starting from amino acid 298 (data not shown). We subsequently isolated a full-length mouse PIAS3 cDNA clone from the cDNA library derived from a mouse T cell hybridoma cell line KMls-8.3.5 (20Lee S.Y. Park C.G. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 669-674Google Scholar) for further study. To confirm the interaction between p65 and PIAS3 in vitro, we performed a GST pull-down assay. GST fusion proteins with N-terminal or C-terminal portions of p65 (Fig. 1A) were synthesized in E. coli, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and incubated with the cell lysates containing PIAS3. As shown in Fig. 1B, PIAS3 was retained by GST-p65N-(1-313) (lane 2), but not by GST alone or GST-p65C-(314-551) (lanes 1 and 3). To demonstrate the interaction between p65 and PIAS3 in mammalian cells, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation assay. FLAG-tagged full-length PIAS3 was coexpressed with p65, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either control IgG or anti-FLAG monoclonal Ab. The coimmunoprecipitated protein was examined for the presence of p65 by immunoblot assay using anti-p65 Ab. In Fig. 1C, it can be seen that p65 can be coprecipitated by antibody against the FLAG epitope but not by control mouse IgG Ab. To further confirm this finding, the same cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 polyclonal Ab, and then bound PIAS3 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG Ab (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that p65 interacts with PIAS3 in mammalian cells. To test whether endogenous PIAS3 and p65 can interact in vivo in response to treatment with TNF-α, we prepared total cell lysates from T cell hybridoma KMls-8.3.5 where both proteins are naturally expressed. With these extracts, we performed immunoprecipitations with either polyclonal anti-p65 Ab or with IgG as a control. As shown in Fig. 1E, endogenous PIAS3 was coimmunoprecipitated from the KMls-8.3.5 cell lysates treated with TNF-α by the p65 Ab (lane 4) but not with the control IgG (lane 2). In contrast, when untreated with TNF-α, PIAS3 was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of p65 Ab (lane 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that p65 interacts with PIAS3 in vivo upon TNF-α stimulation. PIAS3 Inhibits Transcriptional Activation of NF-κB—Because PIAS3 was shown to bind p65, we asked whether PIAS3 had any effect on the NF-κB-dependent transcription through diverse NF-κB activating signals. 293T cells were cotransfected with NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmids either with empty vectors or with PIAS3 expression plasmids. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were either left untreated or treated with human TNF-α (20 ng/ml) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 6 h, and then NF-κB activity was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, endogenous NF-κB activity was maintained at a basal level, and this activity was not affected by PIAS3 overexpression. When overexpressed, PIAS3 inhibited TNF-α-and IL-1β-mediated NF-κB activations. The similar effects of PIAS3 were observed when NF-κB was activated by overexpressing TNF family receptors (Fig. 2B) or various TRAF molecules (Fig. 2C), including RANK, TNFR1, CD30, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, all of which are well known to mediate NF-κB activation. These results suggest that PIAS3 might function at a point where divergent signals merge in the NF-κB activation pathways. Because divergent NF-κB activation signals converge on IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation, we investigated the effect of PIAS3 on IκB-α. We did not find any differences between PIAS3-overexpressed and normal cells in the extent of the TNF-α-induced IκB-α phosphorylation and degradation (Fig. 3A), suggesting PIAS3 might act downstream of IκB-α.Fig. 3Effects of PIAS3 on the p65-mediated NF-κB-transactivation. A, PIAS3 does not interfere with TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. 293T cells were transfected with either 1 μg of pFLAG-PIAS3 or same amount of empty vector. After 36 h of transfection, cells were stimulated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for indicated minutes and lysed. Western blotting was performed on the lysates with specific antibody for IκBα and phospho-IκBα (upper and middle panels). The lower panel shows that equal amounts of PIAS3 were expressed in each transfection. B, PIAS3 represses p65-mediated transcriptional activity. 293T cells were transfected with (κB)3-interferon-luciferase reporter plasmid and with either pcDNA-p65 (0.5 μg) or pFLAG-PIAS3 (1 μg) expression plasmids as indicated. Reporter assays were performed as described in Fig. 2A. Controls for the expression of p65 and FLAG-tagged PIAS3 are shown in the bottom panel. The results shown represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. C, effects of PIAS3 on the c-Jun transcriptional activity monitored with a pathway-specific trans-activator plasmid encoding a GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to c-Jun activator domains and a GAL4 UAS/luciferase reporter construct. 293T cells were transfected with 100 ng of pFR-luc and 50 ng of pFA-c-Jun together with the indicated amounts of PIAS3 expression plasmids. As positive controls, either mock transfected cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 6 h or cells or 293T cells were transfected with 0.2 μg of an expression vector containing the MEKK. The results shown represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. Controls for the expression of FLAG-tagged PIAS3 are shown in the bottom panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate whether PIAS3 suppresses the activity of NF-κB through acting on the p65, we examined the effect of PIAS3 on NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity when p65 is overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 3B, PIAS3 was able to suppress p65-mediated NF-κB activity without affecting p65 expression levels. Therefore, the ability of PIAS3 to inhibit NF-κB activity most likely results from direct interaction between p65 and PIAS3 rather than from its activity on upstream signaling events involving TRAFs and IκB-α. Next, we asked whether PIAS3 could affect the transactivation function of any other transcription factor that can be activated by TNF-α. To investigate this, we examined the effect of PIAS3 on the c-Jun transcriptional activity using reporter constructs expressing c-Jun-dependent luciferase. In contrast to the results seen with NF-κB reporter, overexpression of PIAS3 in 293T cells did not repress a c-Jun-dependent reporter but, rather, enhanced it to a certain extent (Fig. 3C). Therefore, PIAS3 suppression of NF-κB activity did not result from a general suppression of transcription. Because our data indicated that PIAS3 overexpression could inhibit TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 2A), it seemed likely that inhibition of PIAS3 expression would result in increased TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activity. MCF-7 cells were transfected with Oligofectamine alone or siRNA directed against PIAS3 or cyclophilin as a control. After 48 h of siRNA transfection, an NF-κB luciferase reporter construct was cotransfected along with a β-galactosidase expression vector. After an additional 24 h, the cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 6 h. TNF-α stimulation increased the NF-κB activity in both Oligofectamine and control siRNA-transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner, and there was a further increase in TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activity in PIAS3 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the reduction of PIAS3 leads to increased TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activity. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PIAS3 siRNA, but no RNA interference or cyclophilin siRNA, specifically reduced the expression of PIAS3 but not β-actin (Fig. 4B). The LXXLL Motif in PIAS3 Is Exclusively Required for the Interaction with p65—The LXXLL motif has been previously demonstrated to be a protein interaction module that can mediate coactivator-nuclear receptor (NR) interactions or coactivator-coactivator interactions (26Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref Google Scholar, 27Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R.

A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Google Scholar). Because PIAS3 contains the LXXLL motif starting at the amino acids residue 19, it was of interest to examine whether this putative LXXLL motif is required for the interaction with p65. We generated FLAG-tagged N-terminal (aa 1-391) or C-terminal (aa 391-584) deletion constructs of PIAS3 and a mutant PIAS3 (PIAS3 LL-AA) with point mutations in the LXXLL motif of PIAS3 (LQVLL to LQVAA) (Fig. 5A) and cotransfected these PIAS mutants with p65 DNAs into 293T cells. Coimmunoprecipitation data showed that p65 interacted with the C-terminal deletion mutant of PIAS3 expressing N-terminal domain (P3N) but failed to interact with the N-terminal deletion mutant (P3C) (Fig. 5B, lane 4 and 5). Interestingly, the PIAS3 LL-AA mutant was unable to interact with p65 (lane 3), even though all PIAS3 derivatives were produced in comparable levels (middle panel). Theses result indicated that the LXXLL motif of PIAS3 is minimally required for the interaction with p65. To determine the functional significance of the LXXLL motif-mediated interaction between PIAS3 and p65 in terms of NF-κB activity, 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding the wild type PIAS3 or the various PIAS3 mutants together with p65 and NF-κB reporter. Consistent with the in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays, PIAS3-C lacking N-terminal portions (1-391) containing the LXXLL motif and the PIAS3 LL-AA mutant, did not inhibit the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. However, PIAS3-N, which has the LXXLL motif and is able to bind to p65, inhibited the NF-κB activity comparable to the wild type PIAS3. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of PIAS3 and most likely the LXXLL motif are important in interacting with p65 and negatively regulating p65-mediated NF-κB activity. PIAS3 Interferes with the Interaction of p65 with CBP—Because the CBP and its homologue, p300 coactivator, interact with the p65 subunit of NF-κB, thereby enhancing its ability to activate transcription (12Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Google Scholar, 13Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Google Scholar), we sought next to determine whether PIAS3 could also suppress the NF-κB activity enhanced by coexpression of p65 and CBP. Whereas overexpression of p65 stimulated transcription from the reporter gene by nearly a factor of 10 and CBP alone stimulated transcription by 2.5-fold, the combination of p65 plus CBP led to a 20-fold increase in transcriptional activity (Fig. 6A). Importantly, cotransfection of PIAS3 with p65 plus CBP resulted in significantly less activation of NF-κB. In contrast, expression of PIAS3 mutant with point mutations in the LXXLL motif had no effect on the NF-κB activity. We next asked whether overexpression of CBP could overcome the inhibition effects of PIAS3 on NF-κB activity. Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of wild type PIAS3 were relieved when CBP was expressed at a high dose (Fig. 6B). Together, these results suggest that PIAS3 can suppress the transcriptional enhancement of NF-κB activity by CBP. Previous studies have shown that the N-terminal region of CBP (aa 1-450) is sufficient for the interaction with p65 (10Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Google Scholar, 12Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal 450 amino acids of CBP are required to mediate NF-κB-induced transcriptional enhancement (31Hiroi M. Ohmori Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 651-660Google Scholar). Thus, it was conceivable that PIAS3 blocks coactivation by CBP by inhibiting the formation of the p65-CBP complex. To test this possibility, 293T cells were cotransfected with an expression plasmid encoding the GST-fused N-terminal region of CBP (aa 1-450) together with p65 and increasing amounts of PIAS3 expression vectors. As shown in Fig. 7A, p65 was detected in lysates precipitated with GST beads containing the N-terminal region of CBP (lane 3). Importantly, when GSTCBP and p65 were expressed together with PIAS3, the amounts of p65 found in GST beads precipitates were severely decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A, lane 4 and 5). Similar results were obtained when a full-length CBP was used to transfect and to immunoprecipitate the proteins (Fig. 7B,lanes 3-5). Taken together, these results suggest that transcriptional suppression by PIAS3 is dependent on its ability to compete with CBP for binding to p65. In this study, we present data demonstrating the interaction of the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB with PIAS3. By both in vitro binding assay and coimmunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that the Rel homology domain of the p65, but not the C-terminal domain, which contains the transactivation domain, interacts with the N-terminal region of PIAS3. Further mapping of the PIAS3 interaction revealed that an LXXLL coregulator signature motif of PIAS3 is responsible for the functional interaction with p65. When PIAS3 was overexpressed, the transcriptional activity of p65 was significantly suppressed. Interestingly, overexpression of PIAS3 interfered with the ability of the CBP coactivator to interact with p65. This suggests that PIAS3 exerts its effects through interfering with the interaction between p65 and CBP. Based on these results, we conclude that PIAS3 is a novel negative regulator of NF-κB p65. Biochemical studies indicate that PIAS proteins interact directly with different transcription factors, including STATs, steroid receptors, and p53, and can regulate their transcriptional activities both positively or negatively (32Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Google Scholar, 33Kotaja N. Aittomaki S. Silvennoinen O. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1986-2000Google Scholar, 34Gross M. Liu B. Tan J. French F.S. Carey M. Shuai K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3880-3887Google Scholar, 35Nelson V. Davis V. Maxwell S.A. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 221-234Google Scholar). In particular, PIAS3 was initially isolated as a specific inhibitor of STAT3 signaling and shown to inhibit the DNA-binding activity of STAT3 (36Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Google Scholar). Recently, however, additional roles of PIAS3 have been reported in different transcriptional regulations through its physical interaction with other proteins, including a zinc finger protein Gfi-1 (37Rodel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bac P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Google Scholar), microphthalmia transcription factor (38Levy C. Nechushtan H. Razin E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1962-1966Google Scholar), and nuclear receptor coactivator TIF2 (39Jiménez-Lara A.M. Heine M.J.S. Gronemeyer H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 142-146Google Scholar). In addition to these different classes of signal-activated transcriptional factors or coactivators, our findings put NF-κB p65 to the list of PIAS3-interacting proteins. It is likely that the transcriptional effects of PIAS3 might be quite diverse, depending on their interaction partners, activation signals, and cell types. PIAS3 expression did not block upstream events in the NF-κB activation cascades, including phosphorylation and degradation of IκB-α or nuclear translocation of p65 (data not shown). Recent data indicated that PIAS3 predominantly exists in the nucleus (37Rodel B. Tavassoli K. Karsunky H. Schmidt T. Bac P. Möröy T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5845-5855Google Scholar). When stimulated with TNF-α, which causes the translocation of NF-κB, the activated NF-κB might interact with PIAS3 already present in the nucleus. Consistently, we detected TNF-α-dependent interaction of p65 with PIAS3. Similar to this, STAT3-PIAS3 interaction, in which their interaction depends on IL-6 stimulation, is also found in the nucleus (36Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Google Scholar). Our in vitro gel shift assays did not reveal any effect of PIAS3 on the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB (data not shown). This finding is consistent with a previous report (36Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Google Scholar), in which GST-PIAS3 had no effect on the TNF-α-induced DNA-binding activity of NF-κB. It is therefore likely that the mechanism by which PIAS3 inhibits p65-mediated transcriptional activity is different from those involving STAT3 or microphthalmia transcription factor, whose DNA-binding activity is inhibited by PIAS3. One attractive hypothesis is that PIAS3 regulates p65-mediated transcriptional activity through promoting p65 sumoylation, because a putative RING domain of the PIAS family has recently been shown to be involved in sumoylation and in fact has been suggested to function as a sumo-E3 ligase (40Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Google Scholar, 41Kahyo T. Nishida T. Yasuda H. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 713-718Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitination, sumoylation does not appear to promote protein degradation but rather was shown to be involved in protein-protein interactions, subcellular compartmentalization, and protein stability (42Schdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H. Pichler A. Melchior F. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3088-3103Google Scholar, 43Kentsis A. Gordon R.E. Borden K.L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 667-672Google Scholar). In this context, we tested whether sumoylation regulates p65-mediated transcriptional activity. However, SUMO conjugation of p65 is not detected in the presence of PIAS3 and overexpression SUMO and p65 together with κB reporter gene did not repress p65-mediated NF-κB activity (data not shown). Furthermore, p65 lacks the consensus sequences (ψKXE; ψ, hydrophobic amino acid), required for SUMO-1 conjugation (44Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Google Scholar). The LXXLL signature motif was originally identified in several nuclear receptor coactivators and corepressors. The α-helical LXXLL signature motif is a protein interaction module that has been demonstrated to mediate coregulator-NR interactions or coregulator-coregulator interactions (27Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. Stallcup M.R. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3343-3356Google Scholar, 28Neaear A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature (Lond.). 1999; 398: 828-832Google Scholar, 29Rachez C. Lemon B.D. Suldan Z. Bromleigh V. Gamble M. Neaear A.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Freedman L.P. Nature (Lond.). 1999; 398: 824-828Google Scholar). In addition, the LXXLL motif in PIASy is required for suppression of androgen receptor (AR) transactivation (45Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar). Recently, Liu et al. (30Liu B. Gross M. Hoeve J. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3203-3207Google Scholar) observed that the LXXLL motif of PIASy is not involved in PIASy-STAT1 interaction but is absolutely required for the repression activity of PIASy. Thus, it seems that the LXXLL motif can act either as a protein interaction module or as a functional repressor module depending on the binding partners. In our experiments with PIAS3, mutating the LXXLL motif to LXXAA resulted in the loss of interaction with p65, suggesting the motif is an interaction module of p65. Recent work has shown that NF-κB-dependent gene expression requires the function of transcriptional coactivators, including CBP, SRC-1/NcoA-1, TIF-2/GRIP-1/NcoA2, and p/CAF (17Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577Google Scholar). Among them, CBP plays a critical role as a bridge factor between sequence-specific transcriptional activator and basal transcriptional machinery. In this context, interaction of CBP with p65 may facilitate recruitment of other transcriptional coactivators. Because the level of CBP is limiting in comparison to that of p65 (46Hottigen M.O. Felzien L.K. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3124-3134Google Scholar), it is possible that competition for p65 between CBP and PIAS3 may regulate p65 transactivation. In accordance with this scenario, increasing amounts of CBP could counteract PIAS3-mediated repression on NF-κB activity. Conversely, increasing amounts of PIAS3 interfere with CBP-p65 interaction. Taken together, we propose a model whereby PIAS3 functions as a negative regulator of NF-κB. In the absence of PIAS3 for a given cell type, the activated NF-κB interacts with various factors, including general transcription factors and coactivators, to activate the transcription of NF-κB target genes. In contrast, when PIAS3 exists in the nucleus, PIAS3 physically interacts with p65, thereby affecting NF-κB activity depending on the relative levels of NF-κB, coactivators such as CBP, and PIAS3.

Cholesterol is an essential molecule for animal cells to maintain and regulate function and structure of the biomembrane. It is synthesized in most somatic cells, whereas its catabolic site is limited to the liver and to the steroidogenic cells except for partial hydroxylation in some somatic cells. Accordingly, cholesterol is removed from the cells and transported to the liver for its conversion to bile acids, and this is one of the essential events in cholesterol homeostasis for the body and for the cells (1Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). High density lipoprotein (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CE, cholesteryl ester; MEM, modified Eagle's essential medium; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; ABCA1, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1; LDL, low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; apoA-I, apolipoprotein A-I; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CE, cholesteryl ester; MEM, modified Eagle's essential medium; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. is believed to play a central role in this system, and this is thought to be one of the antiatherogenic characteristics of HDL. This reaction takes place through at least two distinct mechanisms: 1) physicochemical release of cholesterol from the cell surface, which is driven by cholesterol esterification on HDL, and 2) the apolipoprotein-mediated pathway to remove cellular cholesterol and phospholipid to generate new HDL particles (2Hara H.

HDL thus plays a central role in both mechanisms.Apolipoprotein-dependent cellular cholesterol release is absent in fibroblasts from patients with Tangier disease (3Francis G.A. Knopp R.H. Oram J.F.

We reported that probucol causes dramatic selective inhibition of the apolipoprotein-mediated cellular lipid release and its binding to cells (23Tsujita M. Yokoyama S.

Thus, this is another piece of evidence that the apolipoprotein-cell interaction to generate HDL is a major source of plasma HDL. Probucol can therefore be considered an inhibitor of the function of ABCA1.Cellular ABCA1 undergoes both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations (25Wang N. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of ABCA1 is carried out by oxysterol through the liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor system, which seems relevant to the function of ABCA1 to expel an excess amount of cell cholesterol (25Wang N. Tall A.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of ABCA1 is also mediated by other factors such as cyclic AMP (13Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

On the other hand, stabilization of ABCA1 can be an alternative mechanism to regulate ABCA1 activity, such as protection of ABCA1 protein by helical apolipoprotein (26Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

Probucol did not influence the transcription and intracellular distribution of ABCA1 but suppressed its degradation by calpain to increase inactive ABCA1 in the plasma membrane.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Reagents—Probucol (4,4′-(isopropylidenedithio)bis [2,6-di-tert-butylphenol]) was a generous gift from Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Calpain and calpeptin were from Calbiochem. [1,2-14C]Cholesteryl oleate and [3H]acetic acid were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, and iodine-125 (125I) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Lipoprotein and Apolipoprotein—Lipoproteins were isolated from fresh human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation in sodium bromide at a density of 1.006–1.063 g/ml for LDL and 1.125–1.21 g/ml for HDL. Lipoprotein-free plasma protein fraction was collected as a bottom fraction with a density of 1.21 g/ml. All plasma fractions were thoroughly dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl (PBS). Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) was isolated from the human HDL fraction by delipidation followed by anion exchange column chromatography in 6 m urea as described previously (34Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ApoA-I was dissolved in PBS before use in experiments according to the methods described previously (34Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1982; 91: 1267-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Preparation of Probucol-containing LDL and Probucol-carrying Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)—To deliver probucol to the cells, probucol-containing LDL was prepared according to the method described previously (23Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13011-13020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Nishikawa O. Yokoyama S. Kurasawa T. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Lipid microemulsion was prepared by sonicating egg phosphatidylcholine (Avanti) and triolein (Wako Pure Chemicals) with and without probucol. LDL (15 mg of protein) was incubated at 37 °C for 48 h with the microemulsion containing or not containing probucol in the presence of lipid-free plasma fraction (1.5 g of protein), dithionitrobenzoic acid (2 mm), aprotinin (20 units/ml), gentamycin (0.1 mg/ml), EDTA (0.5 mm), and NaN3 (0.1% w/v). The mixture was applied to a dextran sulfate-cellulose column to recover LDL as the bound fraction eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. LDL was further purified by ultracentrifugal floatation at a density of 1.063 g/ml and thoroughly dialyzed against PBS. To label cholesteryl ester (CE) in LDL, the emulsion was prepared with [14C]cholesteryl oleate (30 μCi), and the same procedure was applied to prepare the labeled LDL containing probucol. Alternatively, probucol was conjugated with BSA (fatty acid-free, Sigma). 250 μg of probucol was solubilized in 125 μl of methanol and incubated with 10 ml of 10% BSA (w/v) for 1 h at 37 °C.Cell Culture and Loading with LDL—WI-38 human fibroblast cells (RIKEN Cell Bank) (36Stanbridge E. Onen M. Perkins F.T. Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1969; 57: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C in Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma) with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Inc.), 5 units/ml penicillin, and 5 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into a 35-, 60-, or 100-mm dish at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/ml. When the cells were grown to 80% of a confluent stage, the probucol-containing LDL (0–50 μg as LDL protein/ml) or probucol-carrying BSA (0.2%, w/v) was added for 24-h incubation to load probucol in the cells.Cellular Lipid Release Assay—The probucol-loaded cells prepared as described above were washed and maintained in the lipoprotein-free medium for the next 24 h prior to any further experiments. The cells were incubated for 24 h with various amounts of apoA-I in the medium containing 0.02% BSA. Lipid was extracted from the medium with chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and cells with n-hexane:2-propanol (3:2, v/v), and total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and choline-phospholipid were determined by colorimetric enzymatic assay system (Kyowa Medics) (13Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11092-11099Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Determination of Probucol in the Cells—Probucol in the cell lipid extracts was measured by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography according to the method described by Satonin and Coutant (37Satonin D.K. Coutant J.E. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 380: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The cell extracts from the medium of a 60-mm dish were dissolved in acetonitrile, hexane, 0.1 m ammonium acetate (90:6.5:3.5, v/v/v) and injected into a Deltapak C18 reversed-phase column (150 × 3.9 mm, 300 A; Waters). The mobile phase was acetonitrile:water (85:15, v/v) with the flow rate at 1.5 ml/min, and the probucol was detected by absorbance at 240 nm.Evaluation of the Synthesis of Lipids—WI-38 cells at 80% of confluent stage in 35-mm dishes were washed with PBS and cultured in 1 ml of modified Eagle's essential medium (MEM) containing 0.2% BSA with or without probucol. After replacement with 1 ml of fresh medium, the cellular lipid was labeled by incubating for 2 h with 20 μCi/ml [3H]acetic acid. Lipid was extracted with n-hexane:2-propanol (3:2, v/v), and radioactivity was determined in cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and cholesteryl ester after separation by thin layer chromatography.Determination of Cholesterol Distribution to the Plasma Membrane—To determine traffic of newly synthesized cellular cholesterol moved to the cell surface, the cells were treated with 0.2% BSA carrying and not carrying probucol for 24 h and were labeled with [3H]acetic acid for 2 h. To determine distribution of LDL-derived cholesterol to the cell surface, the cells were incubated for 24 h with [14C]CE-LDL (50 μg of protein/ml) containing or not containing probucol, washed with PBS, and incubated with MEM containing heparin (1400 IU/ml) for 45 min at 4 °C to remove surface-bound LDL. The labeled cells were quickly washed with PBS, fixed with 1% glutaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and washed with PBS to remove the fixative reagent. The cells were then incubated with cholesterol oxidase (1 unit/ml) in MEM for 1 h to allow the conversion of cholesterol to cholestenone in the plasma membrane (38Porn M.I. Ares M.P. Slotte J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1385-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the cells were washed with PBS, cellular lipids were extracted, and radioactivity was determined for cholesterol, cholestenone, and cholesteryl ester separated by thin layer chromatography.Subcellular Membrane Fractionation—Bulk membrane fraction was prepared as follows. Cells in 100-mm dishes were harvested and treated with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mm benzamidine) for 30 min on ice with vortexing every 10 min. The cell debris and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 444,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Subcellular membrane subfractions were prepared as follows. The cell pellet after centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min was lysed with cold extract solution (0.02 m boric acid, 0.3 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, and protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma), pH 10) for 15 min on ice with vortexing every 5 min. The cell debris and nuclei were discarded by centrifugation at 650 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for l h at 4 °C. The pellet was harvested, and the supernatant was further centrifuged at 290,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The second pellet was harvested, and the supernatant was treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate the protein.Western Blotting—The membrane fraction and cellular subfractions were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm benzamidine, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor cocktails (Sigma) and were sonicated for 5 s. After determination of the protein content by a BCA method (Pierce), the fractions were dissolved in 9 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, 1% dithiothreitol and were developed in 6 or 15% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 10% SDS, respectively, and the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) by semidry blotter in blotting buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 m glycine, and 10% methanol (v/v)) for 3.5 h. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20 and was probed with the rabbit antiserum against the C-terminal peptide of human ABCA1 (26Arakawa R.

The immunoreactive proteins were visualized by ECL or the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences).ABCA1 Degradation Rate—WI-38 cells in 100-mm dishes were incubated in 6 ml of the medium with LDL (300 μg of protein) containing or not containing probucol as described above. Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated at 37 °C in MEM containing 20 ng/ml cycloheximide (Wako Pure Chemicals). ABCA1 in the cell membrane fraction was detected by immunoblot analysis as described above. For studying the calpain-mediated proteolysis of ABCA1, the experiment was performed according to the method described by Wang et al. (27Wang N. Chen W. Linsel-Nitschke P. Martinez L.O. Agerholm-Larsen B. Silver D.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cells were washed three times with PBS and placed on ice for 10 min. Then cells were permeabilized by incubating on ice for 15 min with 80 μg/ml digitonin in MEM. The cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with μ-calpain (0.1 μm) in MEM containing 2 mm CaCl2. The cells were lysed with 3 ml of buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine) containing 40 μg/ml calpeptin. The ABCA1 in the cell membrane fraction was analyzed by using immunoblot analysis.RNA Extraction and Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells by using RNA extraction reagent (Isogen, Nippon Gene). After contaminated genomic DNA was digested with DNase I (Takara Shuzo Co.), first standard cDNA was synthesized by a SuperScript™ preamplification system (Invitrogen) from 2 μg of the total RNA. PCR was performed by using primers (sense and antisense) for cDNA 5′-GAA CTG GCT GTG TTC CAT GAT-3′ and 5′-GAT GAG CCA GAC TTC TGT TGC-3′ (for ABCA1) and 5′-ATG GTG GGA ATG GGT CAG AAG-3′ and 5′-CAC GCA GCT CAT TGT AGA AGG-3′ (for β-actin) (synthesized by Sawady Technology Co., Ltd.). The quantification of ABCA1 and β-actin mRNA was achieved using SYBR Green PCR master mix reagent in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems Japan).125I-Apolipoprotein A-I Binding to the Cell Surface—Specific binding of 125I-labeled apoA-I was estimated as displaceable binding by excessive cold apoA-I (23Tsujita M. Yokoyama S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13011-13020Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ApoA-I was dissolved as 1 mg in 20 ml of the 0.1 m PBS (pH 6.5) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. 125I (2 mCi) and 15 beads of IODO-BEAD® iodination reagent (Piece) were added to the solution, and the labeling reaction was carried out with stirring for 15 min at room temperature. The solution was concentrated by using the Ultrafree-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) with centrifugation at 700 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The analysis of product by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that 94% of the total radioactivity was recovered in apoA-I and that the specific radioactivity was 2367, 608 cpm/μg of protein. After treatment with LDL containing or not containing probucol, cells in 35-mm dishes were incubated with various concentrations of 125I-apoA-I at 0 °C for 2 h in 500 μl of MEM (pH 7.4, containing 25 mm HEPES, 0.2% BSA). The cells were chased twice by the medium with or without 50 μg/ml non-labeled apoA-I at 0 °C for 4 h and washed with cold PBS. The cell-bound radioactivity was recovered in 1 ml of 0.5 m NaOH.RESULTSConsistent with our previous reports (23Tsujita M. Yokoyama S.

This effect was dose-dependent with respect to the dose of probucol-containing LDL (Fig. 1B). Probucol also inhibited displaceable binding of 125I-apoA-I (Fig. 1C). Dose-dependent increase of cellular probucol content was observed within the range of the dosage of the probucol-containing LDL employed in the present experiment (Fig. 2A). Loading of cholesterol to the cells via LDL was not influenced by the presence of probucol in LDL (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Accumulation of LDL-derived cholesterol and probucol in WI-38 cells. A, WI-38 cells were incubated with probucol-free or probucol-containing LDL (total of 50 μg of protein) in 3 ml of medium within a 60-mm dish for 24 h. Probucol accumulated in the cells was measured using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each bar represents an individual experimental data point. B, the accumulation of cholesterol in WI-38 by incubating with probucol-free LDL (open bar) and probucol-carrying LDL (dot-filled bar) was measured. LDL (50 μg of LDL protein/35-mm dish) was incubated with cells at 37 °C for 24 h. The cellular cholesterol was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are the average and S.E. of triplicate assays. FC, free cholesterol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effect of probucol on lipid biosynthesis was examined. To avoid the effect of lipid loading via LDL, probucol was given to the cells as a BSA-probucol conjugate. Probucol also inhibited the apoA-I-mediated lipid release even when it was given directly by this procedure (Fig. 3A). In this condition, incorporation of acetate was somewhat increased by probucol in all of the lipid fractions tested, including free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Effect of probucol on cellular lipid synthesis. A, probucol-carrying or probucol-free 10% BSA was added to the medium to make the final BSA concentration 0.2% and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. ApoA-I was added to the cells and incubated for another 24 h. The cholesterol (Ch) and phospholipid (PL) in the medium were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, WI-38 cells were loaded with probucol as described above, followed by labeling with [3H]acetic acid (20 μCi/ml) for 2 h. The cellular lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography, and radioactivity was determined in the fractions of free cholesterol (FC), cholesteryl ester (CE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SPM). Each bar represents the average and S.E. of three data points. Dot-filled columns and open columns indicate the data for probucol-treated and probucol-free cells, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2068482350,"Atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) has been implicated in several signaling pathways such as cell polarity, cell survival, and cell differentiation. In contrast to other PKCs, aPKC is unique in having the PB1 (Phox and Bem 1) domain in the N terminus. The aPKC PB1 domain binds with ZIP/p62, Par6, or MEK5 through a PB1-PB1 domain interaction that controls the localization of aPKC. Here, we determined the three-dimensional structure of the PB1 domain of PKCι by NMR and found that the PB1 domain adopts a ubiquitin fold. The OPCA (OPR, PC, and AID) motif inserted into the ubiquitin fold was presented as a ββα fold in which the side chains of conserved Asp residues were oriented to the same direction to form an acidic surface. This structural feature suggested that the acidic surface of the PKCι PB1 domain interacted with the basic surface of the target PB1 domains, and this was confirmed in the case of the PKCι-ZIP/p62 complex by mutational analysis. Interestingly, in the PKCι PB1 domain a conserved lysine residue was located on the side opposite to the OPCA motif-presenting surface, suggesting dual roles for the PKCι PB1 domain in that it could interact with either the conserved lysine residue or the acidic residues on the OPCA motif of the target PB1 domains.

Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3099-3103Google Scholar), followed by the cloning of isoform PKCι/λ (2Selbie L.A. Schmitz-Peiffer C.

Now, aPKC has been suggested as playing a crucial role in signal transduction pathways such as cell polarity, cell differentiation, and cell survival (4Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Google Scholar, 5Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Google Scholar). In contrast to conventional PKC, aPKC contains only a single C1 domain but is devoid of a C2 domain in the N-terminal regulatory region. A tandem repeat of the C1 domain is known to be a target of diacylglycerol, and the C2 domain is a binding site for Ca2+. However, because of the lack of a C2 domain and the incomplete C1 domain in aPKC, neither Ca2+ nor diacylglycerol activates aPKC. Instead, aPKC contains a PB1 domain at the N terminus. In PKC signaling, the regulation of both the catalytic activity and the spatial localization of PKC is essential. PKC is known to translocate to a specific region in response to activation signals and then phosphorylate specific target proteins. Such spatial localization of PKC in cells is partially regulated by either PKC-binding scaffold proteins or anchoring proteins (6Newton A.C. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2353-2364Google Scholar). In particular, aPKC binds with PB1 domain-containing proteins such as ZIP/p62 (7Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Google Scholar, 8Gong J. Xu J.

Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 4: 1218-1227Google Scholar) through the PB1-PB1 domain interaction. Thus, the PB1-mediated interaction between aPKC and the scaffolding or anchoring proteins plays a crucial role in exerting the biological functions of aPKC (4Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T.

The aPKC-Par6 complex is conserved from nematodes to mammals as a cell polarity regulator (5Ohno S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 641-648Google Scholar, 21Wodarz A. Nat.

A defect in PB1-PB1 interaction between aPKC and Par6 results in incomplete localization (32Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Google Scholar). The PB1 domain is evolutionarily conserved from yeasts to humans, especially in the context of cell polarity-related proteins (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Google Scholar, 33Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Google Scholar) and is classified into two types, type I and type II (34Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Google Scholar). Type I contains a motif of 28 amino acid residues with highly conserved acidic and hydrophobic residues that is named a PC motif (35Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Google Scholar). This name is derived from the fact that the motif occurs in mammalian p40phox and budding yeast Cdc24p. The PC motif is also known as OPR (octicosapeptide repeat) (36Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Google Scholar) or AID (atypical PKC interaction domain) (4Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 399-403Google Scholar) and is generically named the OPCA (OPR, PC, and AID) motif (33Ponting C.P. Ito T. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Inagaki F. Sumimoto H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 10Google Scholar). Type I utilizes acidic residues on the OPCA motif as an interaction site, whereas type II utilizes a conserved lysine residue on the side opposite to the OPCA motif-presenting surface as its interaction site, suggesting that the PB1-PB1 interaction is mainly electrostatic (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Google Scholar, 37Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Google Scholar) but also highly specific and exclusive (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Google Scholar). Moreover, some PB1 domains such as aPKC and ZIP/p62 contain the OPCA motif and the conserved lysine residue and are classified as type I and type II (Fig. 1) (34Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Google Scholar). The OPCA motif of aPKC and the conserved lysine residue of ZIP/p62 were reported to be responsible for aPKC-ZIP/p62 complex formation (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar, 39Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Øvervatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Google Scholar). On the other hand, aPKC uses the conserved lysine residue for interaction with the OPCA motif of MEK5 (32Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Google Scholar), suggesting that the aPKC PB1 domain functions as type I and type II. To elucidate the structural properties of the PB1 domain of aPKC and the interaction mode with its binding partners on the basis of the tertiary structure, we determined the solution structure of the PB1 domain of aPKC, PKCι, by NMR and discussed the biological implications of the PB1-PB1 interaction. Preparation of PKCι-(16–99)—Complementary DNA fragments encoding PKCι and ZIP/p62 were prepared as described previously (9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Google Scholar). Human PKCι-(16–99) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. PKCι-(16–99) was first purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences). Following cleavage with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), PKCι-(16–99) was purified by gel filtration on a Superdex75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences). 13C and 15N uniformly labeled proteins were prepared in M9 medium with 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter; Shoko), [U-13C]glucose (2 g/liter; Shoko), and Celtone-CN powder (1 g/liter; Martek Biosciences). The purified PKCι-(16–99) was concentrated to 1 mm in 90% H2O/10% D2O or 100% D2O containing 50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% (w/v) NaN3. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR measurements were carried out at 25 °C on a Varian UnityPlus 600 or a Unity Inova 600 spectrometer, each equipped with three radio frequency channels and a triple-resonance pulsed field gradient probe. The sequential assignments of 1H, 13C, and 15N resonances were made using through-bond heteronuclear correlations along the backbones and side chains with the pulse sequences three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HN(CO)CA, three-dimensional HNCA, three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, three-dimensional HNCACB, three-dimensional HBHA(CBCACO)NH, three-dimensional C(CO)NH (40Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar), and four-dimensional HCCH-total correlated spectroscopy (41Olejniczak E.T. Xu R.X. Fesik S.W. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 655-659Google Scholar) recorded on the 13C/15N-labeled sample. Distance information between protons was obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited and 13C-edited NOE spectroscopy (40Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996Google Scholar) recorded with a mixing time of 75 ms on the 13C/15N-labeled sample. Structure Calculations—The NMRPipe software suite (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) was used to process the NMR data and pick the resonance peaks. Semiautomatic assignment of the resonance peaks of each amino acid residue was carried out using the Olivia (objective, chemical shift library-based and stereo view assignment) software developed in our laboratory. 2M.

NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Google Scholar). The restraint range was extended to ± 30° for the residues located in α-helices or β-strands. The distance constraints of hydrogen bonds were incorporated based on the characteristic NOE patterns. The restraints used for structural calculations are summarized in Table I. The structural calculations in combination with iterative NOE peak assignments were performed for nine cycles, and a total of 100 structures was finally obtained. The mean coordinates were obtained by averaging the coordinates of the 20 lowest energy structures.

Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). The molecular surface model was generated by the GRASP program (47Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar), and the ribbon model was generated using the PyMOL program (pymol.sourceforge.net/). In Vitro Pull-down Binding Assay—The constructs of various mutants of PKCι-(16–99) and rat ZIP/p62-(1–98) were prepared by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. The PCR products of PKCι variants were ligated to pGEX6P (Amersham Biosciences), and those of ZIP/p62 variants were ligated to pMAL (New England Biolabs). All of the constructs were sequenced to confirm their identities. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) resin for a GST fusion protein or with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein, respectively. For in vitro pull-down binding assays, the purified PKCι variants and ZIP/p62 variants were mixed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Subsequently, a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added, followed by further incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, proteins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The eluates were subjected to 18% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. We evaluated the binding affinity by densitometric analysis of the bands in the SDS-PAGE using NIH Image software as described previously (37Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Google Scholar). Identification of the aPKC PB1 Domain Boundaries Required for Interaction with ZIP/p62—Although a minimum sequence of the PB1 domain of PKCι corresponding to 17–98 amino acids is expected from the sequence alignment of the PB1 domain (Fig. 1), the binding assays for an aPKC-ZIP/p62 complex formation have been performed using a much longer construct of PKCι-(1–107) (7Puls A. Schmidt S. Grawe F. Stabel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6191-6196Google Scholar, 9Ito T. Matsui Y. Ago T. Ota K. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3938-3946Google Scholar, 32Noda Y.

Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar, 39Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Øvervatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Google Scholar). Interestingly, p40phox PB1 required more C-terminally extended residues out of the alignment in order to interact with p67phox PB1, whereas Cdc24p PB1 did not require such a residual region to bind with Bem1p PB1 (35Nakamura R. Sumimoto H. Mizuki K. Hata K. Ago T. Kitajima S. Takeshige K. Sakaki Y. Ito T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 583-589Google Scholar). These results imply diversity and mutual specificity in the PB1-PB1 interaction. Thus, we expressed both constructs of PKCι-(16–99) and PKCι-(1–107) in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells as GST fusion proteins. The results of an in vitro pull-down binding assay revealed that PKCι-(16–99) bound with ZIP/p62 to an extent similar to that of PKCι-(1–107). Thus, PKCι-(16–99) was considered to be a functionally minimum region. This view was consistent with the experimental evidence that the degradation of PKCι-(1–107) occurred soon after the removal of GST by treatment with protease (data not shown). Furthermore, the 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum of PKCι-(16–99) was well dispersed, suggesting that PKCι-(16–99) corresponds to a structural domain (Fig. 2B). We concluded that any region of PKCι that extended out of the PB1 domain did not contribute to the interaction with ZIP/p62, and, thus, PKCι-(16–99) is more suitable for structure determination than PKCι-(1–107). Therefore, we started to determine the tertiary structure of PKCι-(16–99) (hereafter referred to as PKCι PB1) in solution by NMR. Recently, the NMR assignment of PKCι-(1–113) was reported (48Roehrl M.H. Hyberts S.G. Sun Z.Y. Fields A.P. Wagner G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 373-374Google Scholar). In that 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum, the cross-peaks corresponding to the regions outside of PKCι-(16–99) were either absent or located at the random coil region, a finding that is consistent with our result that the PKCι-(16–99) is a structural domain. Structure of the PKCι PB1 Domain—The assignments of 1H, 15N, and 13C NMR resonances were accomplished through the analyses of a suit of the NMR spectra described under “Experimental Procedures.” The structure of PKCι PB1 was determined on the basis of 1492 NOE-derived interproton distance restraints, 56 dihedral angle restraints, and 27 hydrogen bond restraints. A total of 100 structures was calculated, and the 20 lowest energy structures were evaluated. The residues derived from the PreScission protease cleavage site (N-terminal five residues, GPLGS) and the loop between α2 and β5 were flexible because of a lack of long range NOEs. For residues 17–84 and 92–98, the root mean square deviation from the mean structure was 0.41 Å for the backbone Cα, C′, and N atoms, indicating that the backbone of PKCι PB1 was well defined, as illustrated in Fig. 3A. The number of the experimental restraints and the structural statistics of PKCι PB1 are summarized in Table I. The PKCι PB1 domain contains two α-helices (α1, residues 38–49; α2, 74–84) and a mixed β-sheet that consists of five β-strands (β1, residues 17–22; β2, 27–32; β3, 58–62; β4, 68–70; β5, 92–97). The inner two strands, β1 and β5, are parallel, whereas β2, β3, and β4 run in an antiparallel manner. PKCι PB1 takes on a ubiquitin fold on which the OPCA motif is presented. The OPCA motif of PKCι (Leu-56–Leu-83) has a ββα fold, and each of the side chains of Trp-61 and Pro-68 is located on the opposite side of the β-sheet, which forms a hydrophobic core. The β-hairpin between β3 and β4 forms a characteristic turn, referred to as a type I + G1 β-bulge, so that the side chains of the two conserved Asp residues (Asp-63 and Asp-67) orient to the same side to form an acidic surface. Additional residues Glu-64, Glu-65, Glu-76, and Glu-79 in the OPCA motif also contribute to form this acidic surface, the characteristic interaction site of the type I PB1 domain. The tertiary structures of the PKCι and Cdc24p PB1 domains confirm that the OPCA motif has not only sequence similarity but also structural similarity, and, accordingly, PKCι PB1 appears to serve as a type I PB1 domain. Mutational Analysis to Test for Interactions between aPKC and ZIP/p62—The present structural analysis suggests that the OPCA motif in PKCι PB1 can interact with ZIP/p62 PB1. Thus, we performed mutational analysis using an in vitro pulldown binding assay (Fig. 4). Because the conserved Asp residue in the type I PB1 domain was known to be an essential residue, Asp-63 of PKCι and Asp-67 of ZIP/p62 were substituted with Ala. The conserved lysine residue (Lys-20 of PKCι and Lys-7 of ZIP/p62), which is essential in the type II PB1 domain, was also substituted with Ala. We evaluated the effects of these mutations on PKCι-ZIP/p62 complex formation. The D63A mutant of PKCι PB1 abolished the interaction with ZIP/p62 PB1, whereas the K20A mutant of PKCι PB1 had no effect on the binding with ZIP/p62 PB1. Thus, the OPCA motif in PKCι was revealed to be responsible for the interaction with ZIP/p62 PB1, confirming that PKCι PB1 serves as a type I PB1 domain. On the other hand, the K7A mutant of ZIP/p62 PB1 disrupted the ability to bind with PKCι PB1, but the D67A mutant of ZIP/p62 PB1 bound with PKCι PB1. The mobility of the K20A mutant of PKCι-(16–99) was retarded as compared with that of the wild-type protein. The mutant protein would be expected to undergo a mobility shift in the opposite direction, because abnormal retardation of migration on SDS-PAGE is usually considered to be associated with a high proportion of basic amino acids (49Coligan J.E. Dunn B.E. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepancy is presently unknown, it may be due to intramolecular hydrophobic interactions, which can sometimes affect the mobility of proteins in SDS-PAGE (49Coligan J.E. Dunn B.E. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). Therefore, ZIP/p62 PB1 binds with PKCι as a type II PB1 domain. Recently Wilson et al. and Lamark et al. independently reported the results of a binding assay of aPKC-ZIP/p62 and their mutants that were similar to ours (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar, 39Lamark T. Perander M. Outzen H. Kristiansen K. Øvervatn A. Michaelsen E. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34568-34581Google Scholar). Both results strongly support the notion that the OPCA motif in PKCι PB1 interacts with the conserved lysine residue in ZIP/p62 PB1 as a typical PB1-PB1 interaction. Interaction Surface of aPKC PB1 as a Type I PB1 Domain— The electrostatic surface potential of PKCι PB1 is shown in Fig. 5A. The conserved acidic residues in the OPCA motif form two acidic surfaces, wherein Asp-63, Glu-64, Glu-65, and Asp-67 form one acidic surface, and Glu-76 and Glu-79, located on the N-terminal region of α2, form the other. These two acidic surfaces are common features of the type I PB1 domain (34Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Google Scholar). Because the interaction surface of PKCι PB1 is highly acidic, the cognate binding region of ZIP/p62 PB1 should present a basic surface. Considering the alignment and topology of the ZIP/p62 PB1 domain, basic residues on β2 and β5 surround the conserved lysine residue, Lys-7, on β1, suggesting that such basic residues on β2 and β5 seem to assist the PB1-PB1 interaction. Thus, we prepared several mutants where the basic residues on β2 and β5 were replaced by alanine residues, namely the R94A mutant and the R21A/R22A double mutant of ZIP/p62 PB1. We evaluated the effects of these mutations on the formation of the PKCι-ZIP/p62 complex. The R21A/R22A double mutant of ZIP/p62 PB1 showed an apparent decrease in binding affinity with PKCι PB1, suggesting that Arg-21 or Arg-22 or both are involved in the interaction between PKCι PB1 and ZIP/p62 PB1. The R94A mutant also showed an appreciably weaker interaction with PKCι PB1, but the D67A mutation had no effect. These results, taken together, support the notion that ZIP/p62 PB1 serves as a type II PB1 domain and that the basic residues on β2 and β5 (Arg-21 and Arg-22 on β2 and Arg-94 on β5) as well as the Lys-7 of ZIP/p62 PB1 interact with the acidic residues on the OPCA motif of PKCι PB1. Interaction Surface of aPKC PB1 as a Type II PB1 Domain— aPKC PB1 is known to bind with MEK5 PB1, where aPKC PB1 accepts the OPCA motif in MEK5 PB1, thus serving as a type II PB1 domain in the aPKC-MEK5 complex (32Noda Y. Kohjima M. Izaki T. Ota K. Yoshinaga S. Inagaki F. Ito T. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43516-43524Google Scholar). The structure of PKCι PB1 demonstrates that the conserved lysine residue (Lys-20) is exposed, which enables Lys-20 to interact with the OPCA motif of MEK5 PB1 (Fig. 6). The interaction surface of the type II PB1 domain presented on Bem1p PB1 (37Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Google Scholar) and p67phox PB1 (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar) is mainly composed of β1, β2, and α1, and, additionally, β5 in p67phox PB1. Accordingly, the interaction surface of PKCι PB1 with MEK5 can be restricted to the same region. The expected interaction surface of the type II PKCι PB1 domain is shown in Fig. 6 and is comprised of positively charged residues on β1 (Arg-18 and Lys-20), hydrophobic residues such as Ile-27 and Ile-29 on β2, and acidic residues on α1 (Glu-44 and Asp-47). α1in PKCι PB1 uniquely presents a negatively charged surface in contrast to those of Bem1p PB1 (37Terasawa H. Noda Y. Ito T. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Ogura K. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3947-3956Google Scholar) and p67phox PB1 (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar), which present positively charged surfaces (Fig. 6). Thus, in the case of PKCι PB1, neither self-oligomerization using both the OPCA motif and Lys-20 occurs, nor is Lys-20 involved in an interaction with ZIP/p62 PB1 as the type II PB1 domain. In this respect, the negatively charged α1 of PKCι may confer its specificity toward MEK5. Further structural study is required to elucidate this specific interaction. Structural Comparison among the PB1 Domains—The type I and type II PB1 domains form a complex using different regions regardless of their high structural similarity. We compared the structure of the PKCι PB1 domains with those of the Cdc24p and Bem1p PB1 domains and also with ubiquitin using the DALI search engine (50Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). PKCι PB1 is highly similar to both Cdc24p PB1 (root mean square deviation 1.4 Å) and Bem1p PB1 (root mean square deviation 1.7 Å). All form a ubiquitin-like β-grasp fold. Despite the overall structural similarity among the PB1 domains, the structure of the OPCA motif comprising the ββα fold and the turn classified as the type I + G1 β-bulge is unique to the PKCι and Cdc24p PB1 domains, which are classified as type I PB1 domains. On the other hand, the opposite surface defined as the interacting portion of the type II PB1 domain is quite similar to the equivalent portion of the type I PB1 domain and is also similar to the equivalent region of ubiquitin. However, the lysine residue in β1 is absolutely conserved only in type II PB1 domains and is substituted with arginine in type I PB1 domains (Fig. 1). It should be noted that aPKC PB1 and ZIP/p62 PB1, containing both the OPCA motif and the conserved lysine residue, can be expected to serve as type I and type II PB1 domains. Specificity of PB1-PB1 Interaction and Its Biological Implication—The electrostatic surface of the OPCA motif in Cdc24p presents two acidic surfaces split by the hydrophobic residues Val-826 and Val-836. Consistent with its surface, the expected interaction surface of Bem1p is composed of two basic surfaces on β1 and α1 divided by the hydrophobic residues of β2. Thus, the interaction surfaces between the type I and type II PB1 domains are complementary (34Yoshinaga S. Kohjima M. Ogura K. Yokochi M. Takeya R. Ito T. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4888-4897Google Scholar). Although the interaction between two acidic surfaces in the type I PB1 domain and the two basic surfaces in the type II PB1 domain is canonical, the PB1-PB1 interaction uses additional interaction surfaces. The recently determined structure of the p40phox PB1-p67phox PB1 complex revealed that the C-terminal extension out of the p40phox PB1 domain is involved in the interaction with p67phox PB1, where an extensive region that includes β5 of p 67 phox PB1 is used as a binding site (38Wilson M.I. Gill D.J. Perisic O. Quinn M.T. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 39-50Google Scholar) in addition to the canonical interaction. In the aPKC-ZIP/p62 PB1 complex, β5 of the ZIP/p62 PB1 domain probably interacts with the OPCA motif of aPKC, because the region extending out of the aPKC PB1 domain is not required for the interaction. This implies that the interaction between aPKC and ZIP/p62 may differ from that of p40phox and p67phox. Such diversity in interactions in the PB1-PB1 complex gives specificity to the PB1-PB1 interaction. The identification of the type I and type II PB1 surfaces on the opposite sides of aPKC implies that aPKC may bind with both ZIP/p62 and MEK5 in a ternary complex. MEK5 and aPKC form a complex in an epidermal growth factor-dependent manner, and the formation of the complex is required to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) (14Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 4: 1218-1227Google Scholar). ZIP/p62 is also reported to be involved in ERK5 activation downstream of TrkA in NGF (51Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Google Scholar). Thus, the biological relationship in vivo and the PB1-PB1 interaction in vitro suggest that aPKC, ZIP/p62, and MEK5 form a ternary complex through the PB1-PB1 interaction and function cooperatively upstream of ERK5. Conclusion—The structure of aPKC PB1 has the typical features of type I PB1 domains in that the conserved acidic residues in the OPCA motif form two conserved acidic surfaces. Moreover, mutational analysis confirmed that aPKC served as the type I PB1 domain and that ZIP/p62 served as the type II PB1 domain in the aPKC-ZIP/p62 PB1 complex formation. The acidic surface in the type I PB1 domain and the basic surface in the type II PB1 domain are utilized for the canonical interaction in the PB1-PB1 complex formation. However, additional sites are used for specific interactions. This gives diversity and specificity to the PB1-PB1 interaction. The aPKC is known to serve as the type II PB1 domain in the aPKC-MEK5 PB1 complex. The structure of aPKC PB1 shows that the conserved lysine residue in the type II PB1 domain is exposed to interact with the OPCA motif. Notably, α1 of aPKC presents an acidic surface in contrast to the basic surface in Bem1p PB1 or p67phox PB1 (Fig. 6). Such variation in the electrostatic surface potential may also contribute to the specificity of the PB1-PB1 interaction. In addition, the surface potential of aPKC eliminates the possibility of self-oligomerization of the aPKC PB1 domain."

RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that fulfils this role through interaction of binding partners with one of its seven WD40 domains. We recently identified the kinase Fyn and the NR2B subunit of the N-methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) as binding partners of RACK1. Scaffolding of Fyn near its substrate NR2B by RACK1 inhibits Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B and thereby negatively regulates channel function. We found that Fyn and NR2B share the same binding site on RACK1; however, their binding to RACK1 is not mutually exclusive (Yaka, R., Thornton, C., Vagts, A. J., Phamluong, K., Bonci, A., and Ron, D. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 5710–5715). We therefore tested the hypothesis that RACK1 forms a homodimer that allows the simultaneous binding of Fyn and NR2B. We found that RACK1 binds to itself both in vitro and in the brain. Deletion analyses identified a RACK1-RACK1 dimer-binding site within the 4th WD40 repeat, and application of the 4th WD40 repeat or a peptide derivative to hippocampal slices inhibited NMDAR activity. We further found that in hippocampal slices, both RACK1 and NR2B associated with another WD40 protein, the β-subunit of G protein (Gβ), previously shown to heterodimerize with RACK1 in vitro (Dell, E. J., Connor, J., Chen, S., Stebbins, E. G., Skiba, N. P., Mochly-Rosen, D., and Hamm, H. E. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 49888–49895). However, activation of the pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (1–38) G protein-coupled receptor, previously found to induce the dissociation of RACK1 from the NMDAR complex (Yaka, R., He, D. Y., Phamluong, K., and Ron, D. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 9630–9638), attenuated the association of Gβ with RACK1 and NR2B. Based on these results, we propose that WD40-mediated homo- and heterodimerization of RACK1 mediate the formation of a transient signaling complex that includes the NMDAR, a G protein and Fyn. Efficient signaling requires accurate spatial and temporal compartmentalization of proteins. RACK1 is a scaffolding protein that fulfils this role through interaction of binding partners with one of its seven WD40 domains.

However, activation of the pituitary adenylate cyclase polypeptide (1–38) G protein-coupled receptor, previously found to induce the dissociation of RACK1 from the NMDAR complex (Yaka, R., He, D.

Based on these results, we propose that WD40-mediated homo- and heterodimerization of RACK1 mediate the formation of a transient signaling complex that includes the NMDAR, a G protein and Fyn. RACK1 was originally identified as an anchoring protein for protein kinase C (4Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Scopus (636) Google Scholar), but in the past decade, its role has been greatly expanded through structure prediction, localization, and identification of novel binding partners (reviewed in Ref. 5McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Google Scholar). RACK1 is a 36-kDa protein containing seven WD40 repeats that mediate its protein-protein interaction properties (6Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Google Scholar). Homology with the G protein subunit Gβ has led to the prediction of the structure of RACK1 as being a seven-bladed β-sheet propeller (7Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Google Scholar, 8Sondek J. Bohm A. Lambright D.G. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 369-374Google Scholar), suggesting the availability of multiple protein interaction surfaces. RACK1 acts as a scaffolding/anchoring protein for a number of binding partners, ranging from signaling proteins such as kinases (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar, 9Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Google Scholar, 10Kiely P.A. Sant A.

In addition, recent data suggest that RACK1 binding may play a role in gene expression, translation, and ribosome assembly and activation (3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar, 15Angenstein F. Evans A.M. Settlage R.E. Moran S.T. Ling S.C. Klintsova A.Y. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Greenough W.T. J.

Marchisio P.C. Biffo S. Nature. 2003; 426: 579-584Google Scholar). Therefore, RACK1 is a multi-purpose protein that regulates various biological functions. We recently demonstrated that RACK1 acts as a novel inhibitory scaffolding protein associating in a tri-molecular complex with the tyrosine kinase Fyn and its substrate, the NR2B subunit of the glutamate-gated ion channel, NMDAR (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: NMDAR, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; PACAP, pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MBP, maltose binding protein; PSD, postsynaptic density; DSP, dithiobissuccinimidylpropionate; HA, hemagglutinin; aa, amino acids; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potentials; EPSC, excitatory postsynaptic currents; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PDZ, PSD95/Disc-large/ZO-1; AMPAR, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor. We found that this association prevents the phosphorylation of NR2B by Fyn and inhibits NMDAR-mediated activity (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). However, removal of RACK1 from the NMDAR complex via the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin or PACAP(1–38), enables NR2B phosphorylation by Fyn and enhances NMDAR channel function (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar, 3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar). It is interesting that Fyn and NR2B share a region of sequence homology that mediates their binding at a single RACK1 binding site located in the first WD40 repeat at amino acids 35–48 (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Our previous in vitro data suggest that Fyn and NR2B interact with RACK1 simultaneously and that RACK1 serves as a physical bridge between the kinase and its substrate (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). As a possible explanation for the simultaneous interactions of Fyn and NR2B with RACK1 via a single binding site, we hypothesized that RACK1 can bind both Fyn and NR2B by existing as a homodimer. Herein, we present data showing that RACK1 is indeed capable of forming both homo- and heterodimers with Gβ. We propose that the interaction of RACK1 with itself and with Gβ localizes RACK1 near the NMDAR and the appropriate GPCR, allowing the tight regulation of channel function via the GPCR-mediated Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B.

Recombinant Proteins—MBP, MBP-RACK1, GST, and GST-RACK1 were expressed in Escherichia coli using methods described previously (18Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Google Scholar). RACK1ΔC (N1) (aa 1–180) and RACK1ΔN (aa 138–317) (C2), and the 4th WD40 repeat of RACK1 (RPT4) (144–179) were sub-cloned into pTat-HA and expressed and purified from E. coli as described previously (16He D.-Y. Vagts A.J. Yaka R. Ron D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 272-280Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2a). Peptides—RPT4-1 (QDESHSEWVSCVR, RACK1 aa 143–155), RPT-4-2 (CVRFSPNSSNPIIV, RACK1 aa 153–166), the RPT4-1 scrambled peptide (CWHQSEDRSEVSV), and the Tat-peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) were synthesized by SynPep (Dublin, CA). The purity of peptides was greater than 90%, and the integrity was determined by Mass spectroscopy. In vitro overlay binding assay was performed as described in Ref. 18Ron D. Luo J. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24180-24187Google Scholar. In brief, proteins or peptides were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane using a slot blot apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated in overlay block (3% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr 15,000–20,000), and 0.2 m NaCl). Overlay proteins were added to the membrane in overlay buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr 15,000–20,000), and 0.2 m NaCl), and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Unbound material was removed by washing in overlay wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr 15,000–20,000), 0.2 m NaCl, and 1.2 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for overlaid proteins, and the binding was detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) and processed using the STORM PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Column Assay—Crude extracts of MBP-fusion proteins (∼1 mg) were incubated with pre-washed amylose suspension (Bio-Rad), and the column was washed extensively (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). Hippocampal homogenate (1 mg), Tat-HA-fusion proteins (80 μg), or normalized in vitro translated radiolabeled proteins, were applied to the column in overlay buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr 15000–20000), and 0.2 m NaCl). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Interactions were analyzed either by Western blot and ECL (for homogenates and fusion proteins) or by fluorography (for radiolabeled proteins). In Vitro Translation—[35S]Methionine-labeled RACK1 deletion mutants 1–60 (N2), 138–317 (C1), 68–317 (C2), and 144–179 (RPT4) (see also Fig. 2a) proteins were generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (TnT kit; Promega) using appropriate cDNAs. In vitro translated products were normalized before use by SDS-PAGE, and signal was detected by fluorography. Preparation and Fractionation of Whole-Brain or Hippocampal Homogenates—3–4-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats were euthanized with Halothane, and the whole brain was removed. Whole brain or hippocampi were homogenized on ice using a glass teflon homogenizer in homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). Crude membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described previously (19Thornton C. Yaka R. Dinh S. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23823-23829Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was performed using differential centrifugation as described previously (20Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Google Scholar). In brief, pellets were Dounce-homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and large debris (P1). The supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g to obtain a crude synaptosomal fraction (P2) and supernatant (S2). The P2 fraction was subsequently lysed hypo-osmotically and centrifuged at 25,000 × g, resulting in the synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1). The integrity of the synaptosomal fraction was determined by Western blot analysis with the PSD marker, PSD95. Chemical Cross-linking—Hippocampal homogenates (0.5 mg) were treated with the cross-linking reagent DSP (1 mm) as described previously (21Wilson S.E. Smith M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2457-2463Google Scholar). Cross-linked homogenates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed with 5 μg of the appropriate antibodies and 500 μg of hippocampal homogenate as described previously (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar, 3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar). Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (350–400 μm) were prepared from 3–4-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The slices were allowed to recover for 2 h in an artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion medium that contained: 126 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 0.01 mm MgCl2, 2.4 mm CaCl2, 18 mm NaHCO3, and 11 mm glucose, saturated with 95%O2/5%CO2 at 25 °C. After recovery, slices were submerged and continuously superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid at 25 °C. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were recorded from stratum-radiatum of CA1 region with glass microelectrodes filled with 2 m NaCl. To obtain NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs, picrotoxin (100 μm) and 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (10 μm) were added to the bath solution to block GABAA receptor- and AMPAR-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials and EPSPs, respectively. To evoke fEPSPs, Schaffer collateral/commissural afferents were stimulated with 0.1-Hz pulses using steel bipolar microelectrodes at intensities adjusted to produce an evoked response that was 50% of the maximum recorded fEPSP for each recording. The maximal rate of change in fEPSP within a time window selected around the rising phase was calculated. Whole-cell, voltage-clamp recordings were made from CA1 pyramidal cells using a glass microelectrode (3–5MΩ) filled with internal solution containing 117 mm cesium methanesulfonic acid, 2.8 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.4 mm EGTA, 5 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 2.5 mm MgATP, and 0.25 mm MgGTP. The pH and osmolarity of the internal solution were 7.2–7.4 and 290–300 mOsm, respectively. Cells were held at +40 mV and –70 mV for NMDAR- and AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), respectively. Series and input resistances were continuously monitored with a 4-mV depolarizing step given with every afferent stimulus. The amplitudes of EPSCs were measured using a window at the peak of the event, relative to the baseline taken immediately before the stimulus artifact. Data were collected using an Axopatch-1D amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), filtered at 2 kHz, and digitized at 5–10 kHz. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests and one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test were used in data analysis. RACK1 Forms a Dimer in Vitro and in Brain—We previously determined that Fyn and NR2B share the same binding site on RACK1. Our previous results also suggest that the binding of Fyn and NR2B to RACK1 is not mutually exclusive but simultaneous (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). We hypothesized, therefore, that RACK1 forms a homodimer that enables both Fyn and NR2B to bind. To test this hypothesis, RACK1 was expressed as MBP and GST fusion proteins, and binding of GST-RACK1 to MBP-RACK1 was detected using an overlay assay. As shown in Fig. 1a, GST-RACK1 directly interacted with MBP-RACK1 (top) but not with the control protein MBP (top), and GST alone did not bind MBP-RACK1 (bottom), suggesting that RACK1 is capable of interacting with itself. Next, MBP-RACK1 or MBP was immobilized on a column, incubated with brain homogenate, and the association of endogenous RACK1 to recombinant MBP-RACK1 or MBP was determined by Western blot analysis using anti-RACK1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1b, a single immunoreactive band at the size of RACK1 was detected binding to MBP-RACK1 but not to MBP, suggesting that endogenous RACK1 can interact with itself. To test whether the RACK1 homodimer is present in brain in vivo, we treated rat brain homogenates with the membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent DSP, and carried out immunoprecipitations using anti-RACK1 antibodies. In DSP-treated homogenates, a RACK1-immunoreactive band was detected with a mass of ∼65 kDa (Fig. 1c, lane 2). The RACK1 monomer band immunoprecipitated from the untreated homogenate (Fig. 1c, lane 1) but was absent in the immunoprecipitation from the cross-linked homogenate (Fig. 1c, lane 2). These results imply that RACK1 can exist as a dimer in rat brain; however, we cannot exclude the possibility that the higher molecular weight complex also contains a different protein of similar size that interacts with RACK1. Nevertheless, we have found that RACK1 forms a homodimer in vitro and exists in a higher molecular mass complex in rat brain preparations. Identifying the Binding Site for RACK1 Dimerization—Having determined that RACK1 is capable of forming a homodimer, we next set out to identify the dimer-binding site on RACK1. We expressed the N terminus fragment (aa 1–180, N1) and the C terminus fragment (aa 138–317, C1) of RACK1 (Fig. 2a, diagram) as HA-tagged fusion proteins and tested their ability to bind immobilized MBP-RACK1. It is interesting that significant RACK1 binding was detected with both deletion fragments (Fig. 2b, lanes 1 and 2), above the nonspecific binding to MBP alone (Fig. 2b, lanes 3 and 4). The RACK1 mutants N1 and C1 share a common sequence of 42 amino acids (aa 138–180), which encompasses the 4th RACK1 WD40 repeat (aa 144–179). Thus, sequences within this region could mediate at least part of the RACK1-RACK1 interaction. We therefore generated a series of RACK1 deletion mutants: (N2, C1, C2), and the 4th WD40 repeat (RPT4) (Fig. 2a, diagram), expressed by in vitro translation, and the resulting radiolabeled proteins were tested for binding to MBP-RACK1. Consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2b, both C1 and C2 fragments bound to MBP-RACK1 (Fig. 2c, lane 1, middle). No binding was observed for the N2 mutant (Fig. 2c, lane 1, top); however, the 4th WD40 repeat (RPT4) bound to MBP-RACK1 (Fig. 2c, lane 1, bottom), suggesting that the region between amino acids 144–179 contains a RACK1 dimerization site. If RPT4 does indeed represent, at least in part, the dimerization site for RACK1, it should be possible to prevent RACK1 dimerization by preincubation of a RACK1 monomer with the RPT4 fragment. We therefore tested the ability of the radiolabeled C2 deletion mutant to bind with MBP-RACK1 in the presence and absence of the radiolabeled RPT4. RPT4 incubation reduced the binding of the C2 fragment to MBP-RACK1 (Fig. 2d) suggesting further that the 4th WD40 repeat is mediating, at least in part, the RACK1 homodimer formation. Based on these results, we generated two peptides spanning the 4th WD40 repeat, RPT4-1 (amino acids 143–155) and RPT4-2 (amino acids 153–166). To determine whether there was a preference in binding RACK1, we immobilized RPT4-1 and RPT4-2 onto nitrocellulose membrane and performed an overlay assay using MBP-RACK1 or MBP (Fig. 2e). Both peptides bound to MBP-RACK1 but not MBP; however, the binding between MBP-RACK1 and RPT4-1 (Fig. 2e) was much stronger than with RPT4-2 (Fig. 2e), suggesting that a dimer-binding site is contained within amino acids 143–155 of RACK1. RACK1 Homodimerization Is Important for NMDAR Function in the Hippocampus—In the hippocampus, RACK1 serves as an inhibitory scaffolding protein preventing the phosphorylation of the NMDAR by Fyn (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar). Activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by forskolin or PACAP(1–38) causes RACK1 to be removed from the NMDAR complex, which leads to an increase in Fyn phosphorylation of NR2B, and the enhancement of NMDAR-mediated activity (3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar) (Figs. 3b and 4a, open circle). We hypothesized that disruption of the RACK1 dimer by the 4th WD40 repeat fragment or a peptide derivative would interfere with RACK1 maintenance of the NR2B/RACK1/Fyn complex and consequently alter NMDAR-mediated function. To test the hypothesis, we first generated a Tat-HA-RPT4 fusion protein in which the Tat moiety allowed the transduction of the fragment into hippocampal slices (3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar). We measured the ability of PACAP(1–38) to enhance NMDAR activity in the presence and absence of Tat-HA-RPT4 and the Tat-peptide control. As shown in Fig. 3, Tat-HA-RPT4 was successfully transduced into hippocampal slices (Fig. 3a), and the transduction of 1 μm Tat-HA-RPT4 protein, but not the Tat-peptide alone, abolished PACAP(1–38)-mediated enhancement of NMDAR-mediated fEPSPs to baseline amplitude (Fig. 3, b and c). We also carried out whole-cell, patch-clamp experiments using 10 μm forskolin to enhance NMDAR activity in CA1 pyramidal cells, and introduced the RPT4-1 peptide through the recording electrode. We found that in the presence of 100 μm of RPT4-1, but not the scrambled peptide, forskolin-mediated increases in NMDAR-mediated EPSC amplitude were completely inhibited (Fig. 4, a and b). However, RPT4-1 did not alter AMPAR-mediated EP-SCs (Fig. 4c). Because the RACK1/Fyn pathway does not alter AMPAR activity (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5710-5715Google Scholar, 3Yaka R. He D.Y. Phamluong K. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9630-9638Google Scholar), these results suggest that disruption of the RACK1 dimer affects the proper function of the NMDAR.Fig. 4RPT4-1 peptide abolishes forskolin-enhanced NMDAR-EPSCs. a, NMDAR-mediated EPSCs plotted for recordings made from hippocampal CA1 slices in the presence of 10 μm forskolin (Fsk) alone (○, n = 6), forskolin + 100 μm RPT4-1 peptide (•, n = 6), or forskolin + 100 μm scrambled RPT4-1 peptide (▪, n = 6). The horizontal bar indicates the period of forskolin application. Peptides were applied via the patch electrode by means of diffusional exchange during whole-cell recordings as described previously (1Yaka R. Thornton C. Vagts A.J. Phamluong K. Bonci A. Ron D. Proc.

Inset, traces of NMDAR-EPSCs (average of 12 consecutive responses) obtained from the following: 1) a neuron recorded before (baseline, 3–5 min) and during forskolin application (13–15 min); 2) infusion of RPT4-1 peptide followed by forskolin application; 3) infusion of scrambled RPT4-1 peptide followed by forskolin application. b, histogram depicts the percentage change in EPSC amplitude baseline compared with 10–15 min after forskolin application. One-way analysis of variance showed significant difference among different treatments (p < 0.0001). Forskolin-enhanced NMDAR-EPSCs (black bar, 35.12% ± 6.52, n = 6) was significantly abolished in RPT4-1 dialysis experiments compared with forskolin alone (open bar, –6.48% ± 3.83, **, p < 0.001, Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, n = 6), but not in scrambled RPT4-1 peptide dialysis experiments compared with forskolin alone (hatched bar, 35.12% ± 6.52, p > 0.05, Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test, n = 6). c, AMPAR-mediated EPSCs plotted for recordings made from hippocampal CA1 slices in cells dialyzed with 100 μm RPT4-1 peptide. It/I1 [the average size of the AMPAR-EPSCs for each minute (It) divided by the average size of the AMPAR-EPSCs of the first minute (I1)] was plotted for recordings made by using standard whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration from CA1 pyramidal cells. The measurement of AMPAR-EPSCs started 3 min after the breakthrough of the recording pipette (n = 4). Data are presented as mean percentage of baseline ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Gβ Interacts with RACK1 and NR2B in Brain—Recently, β-subunit of G protein, Gβ, was identified as a RACK1 binding partner in vitro (2Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Google Scholar). Gβ is structurally related to RACK1, and both proteins contain seven WD-40 repeats (6Smith T.F. Gaitatzes C. Saxena K. Neer E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 181-185Google Scholar). This study raised the possibility that RACK1 is also capable of forming heterodimers with other WD40 repeat-containing proteins. In addition, a recent study by the same group suggests that in COS-7 cells, Gβ localizes RACK1 to the membrane (22Chen S. Dell E.J. Lin F. Sai J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17861-17868Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that, in brain, the NR2B/Fyn/RACK1 trimolecular complex might be stabilized at the membrane by the interaction of RACK1 with Gβ.Gβγ, together with Gα, associates with GPCRs and is primarily localized to the membrane, as is NR2B (Fig. 5a, top and bottom). Furthermore, a portion of Gβ immunoreactivity is detected in the synaptosomal membranal fraction (LP1) where the majority of NR2B is localized (Fig. 5b). Although RACK1 is mainly cytosolic, a portion of it is found in the membranal fraction (Fig. 5a, middle), and specifically in the synaptosomal membranal fraction (Fig. 5b). To determine whether RACK1 interacts with Gβ in brain, we immunoprecipitated RACK1 from whole-brain homogenates and tested for the presence of Gβ in the complex. We observed a significant amount of Gβ co-immunoprecipitating with RACK1 (Fig. 5c, lane 1). To determine whether the interaction of RACK1 with Gβ allows the formation of a larger complex containing the NMDAR, we immunoprecipitated NR2B and found Gβ to be co-immunoprecipitated as well (Fig. 5d, lane 1). To determine whether the association between NR2B and Gβ was specific, we immunoprecipitated the GluR1 subunit of AMPAR and determined whether Gβ was coimmunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig. 5f, lane 1, no association between GluR1 and Gβ was observed. These results suggest that RACK1 is linking Gβ, and therefore its GPCR, to the NMDAR complex at"

Non-trafficked truncations assembled as tetramers but were nevertheless retained in the endoplasmic reticulum.

Leucine zippers (heptad repeats of hydrophobic residues, such as leucine, isoleucine, and valine) contribute to a C-terminal “coiled coil” structure and are responsible for heteromerization of the GABAB(1) and GABAB(2) (γ-aminobutyric acid) complex (17Kuner R.

Coiled coils have also been described in the C terminus of a series of potassium channels, including KCNQ1 and eag/erg family members (22Jenke M. Sanchez A. Monje F. Stuhmer W. Weseloh R.M. Pardo L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Using peptides derived from eag and erg, the authors proposed that these domains act as sites driving tetramerization, which is required for the mature channel to exit the ER and be processed to the cell surface. The KCNQ1 protein constitutes the pore-forming subunit underlying the slow delayed rectifier IKs in heart. Mutations in KCNQ1 are the commonest cause of LQTS, and, although >90 KCNQ1 mutations have been reported, trafficking of the channel has received little study; only one mutation (T587M) has been associated with mistrafficking to date (2Yamashita F.

In this study, we identified an 11-amino acid (aa) region within the KCNQ1 C terminus that is required for normal cell surface expression. However, neither alanine-scanning mutagenesis across this region nor mutation of known trafficking motifs throughout the protein identified specific residues modulating misprocessing. By contrast, experiments based on structural prediction algorithms support the hypothesis that integrity of a coiled coil, which includes a previously recognized leucine zipper (23Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), is required in the C terminus for normal trafficking. Furthermore, disease-causing mutations clustered in one predicted coil disrupt trafficking, suggesting one common mechanism for this form of the long QT syndrome. Epitope-tagged Constructs—The KCNQ1 DNA (GenBank™ accession number AF000571), a gift from Dr. Mark Keating of Children's Hospital Boston, was subcloned into the pCI vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For all variant constructs, final products were subcloned and sequenced to verify that the desired sequences were introduced. Recombinant PCR was used to introduce the c-Myc (EQKLISEEDL) epitope into the extracellular S1-S2 linker (Myc-KCNQ1) in-frame after nucleotide position 438 between glutamate 146 and glutamine 147 (Fig. 1A). To construct N-terminally triple FLAG epitope-tagged KCNQ1 (FLAG3-KCNQ1), wild-type or mutated KCNQ1 cDNA was isolated and inserted into the p3×FLAG CMV 7.1 vector (Sigma). KCNE1 (minK; GenBank™ number AF135118) DNA was subcloned into the pCI and pSI vectors. The c-Myc epitope was fused in-frame with the N terminus using PCR-based techniques. KCNQ1 mutants were generated using standard techniques of site-directed mutagenesis (1–5 nucleotide changes) or recombinant PCR. Cell Culture and Transfection—For trafficking experiments, tsA-201 cells, which are efficiently transfected, were used. Because tsA-201 cells express an endogenous K+ current, electrophysiology studies were conducted in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cells were transiently transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen); the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N3 plasmid, BD Biosciences Clontech) was cotransfected in electrophysiology experiments to identify transfected cells. When KCNE1 was co-transfected, the molar KCNE1/KCNQ1 ratio was 1:1. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were split, transferred to a Lab-Tek II chamber slide system (Nalge Nunc International), and grown for another 24 h. Electrophysiology—Whole cell voltage clamp was performed at 22 °C with 2–5-megaohm microelectrodes and an Axopatch 200A amplifier. Data acquisition, cell surface area measurement, and data analysis used methods similar to those reported previously for IKr and IKs (24Yang P. Kanki H. Drolet B. Yang T. Wei J. Viswanathan P.C. Hohnloser S.H. Shimizu W. Schwartz P.J. Stanton M.S. Murray K.T. Norris K. George A.L.J. Roden D.M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1943-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 25Yang T. Kanki H.

Pharmacol. 2001; 38: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To obtain current-voltage relations for IKCNQ1 or IKs, cells were held at -80 mV, activating currents were elicited with depolarizing pulses from -60 to +120 mV in 10 mV steps, and deactivating tail currents were recorded upon return to -40 mV. Pulses were delivered every 30 s. The extracellular solution was normal Tyrode's solution (25Yang T. Kanki H. Roden D.M. Circulation. 2003; 108: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The intracellular pipette filling solution contained 200 mm KCl to minimize rundown (discussed in the supplemental “Expanded Experimental Procedures,” found in the on-line version of this article), along with 5 mm 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA)-K4, 5 mm K2ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES. After adjustment to pH 7.2 with KOH, the final intracellular K+ was ∼235 mm. Current was recorded both after break-in and after rundown had stabilized. All electrophysiology experiments were conducted by an investigator blind to the identity of the transfected construct. Immunocytochemistry—For cell surface staining of c-Myc-tagged proteins, cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc antibody conjugated with Cy3 (1:400; Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) twice, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 25 min at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS, glass coverslips were mounted. To study intracellular protein localization, cells were permeabilized and blocked with preincubation solution (0.2% Triton X-100, 2% BSA, and 5% goat serum in PBS) for 20 min after fixation. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS, and the secondary antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibody was Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Images were obtained using an Olympus AX70 (Olympus, Melville, NY) microscope and captured using Optronics DEI-750 Acquire software (Optronics, Goleta, CA). In some experiments, confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, New York) with an argon-krypton laser. Enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and Cy5 fluorescence were detected by excitation at λ = 514 and 633 nm, respectively; a 63×/1.40 Plan-Apochromat oil lens was used, and BP 530-600 and LP 650 filters were used for the EYFP and Cy-5 signals, respectively. The pinhole aperture size for confocal study was 120 μm. Quantification of Fluorescence—The intensity of cell surface fluorescence was analyzed from unmodified 12-bit images captured by a MicroMax CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and Zeiss Axiophot Microscope. Images were obtained using low magnification in near-confluent, single layer areas on the sample slides. Images of multiple samples prepared under identical conditions were obtained on the same study day. Each experiment included non-transfected controls to determine background fluorescence. Further details are presented under “Expanded Experimental Procedures” in the on-line version of this article. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—These experiments were carried out using differentially tagged wild-type and/or mutant KCNQ1 cDNA and KCNE1cDNA cotransfected into tsA-201 cells. Further details are presented under “Expanded Experimental Procedures” on-line. Recognized Trafficking Motifs—KCNQ1 tagged with c-Myc in the extracellular S1-S2 linker generated IKCNQ1 and IKs (when transfected with KCNE1), similar to untagged wild-type channels. Normal cell surface expression of c-Myc-tagged wild-type KCNQ1 is shown in Fig. 1B and contrasted with tagged T587M (reported previously to be mistrafficked) (2Yamashita F. Horie M. Kubota T. Yoshida H. Yumoto Y. Kobori A. Ninomiya T. Kono Y. Haruna T. Tsuji K. Washizuka T. Takano M. Otani H. Sasayama S. Aizawa Y. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2001; 33: 197-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and non-transfected cells. Recognized trafficking motifs in the KCNQ1 C terminus were mutated (649DPE651 → 649APA651, 662YEQL665 → 662AEQL665, and LL at positions 405, 471, 496, and 616 to AA) in the S1-S2 c-Myc-tagged KCNQ1 background, and each was trafficking competent. Because T587M is in the C terminus, we next studied constructs truncated at aa positions 511, 535, 565, 590, 600, 610, and 621 (the protein consists of a total of 676 aa). As shown in Fig. 1C, only wild-type and Δ621–676 proteins displayed staining at the cell surface, whereas staining of the other constructs showed no significant difference from that of non-transfected control cells. Fig. 1D shows robust IKs recorded from cells transfected with wild-type and Δ621–676 as compared with current that was reduced by more than an order of magnitude with Δ610–676; with pulses to 60 mV, activating IKs was 61.7 ± 7.2, 49.6 ± 11.8, and 4.6 ± 1.3 pA/pF, respectively (n = 4 each). Mutant Channels Are Synthesized but Retained in the ER—Lack of cell surface expression may reflect intracellular retention, accelerated turnover, or failure of protein synthesis. Western blotting (Fig. 2A) showed that the amount of trafficking-defective mutant protein produced was similar to that of wild-type, indicating that mutant proteins are retained at intracellular sites. We next considered whether the failure of truncated mutants to reach the cell surface might reflect a failure of assembly as tetramers. Fig. 2B demonstrates a definition of experimental conditions that revealed higher molecular weight bands consistent with dimers, trimers, and tetramers in lysates from cells transfected with FLAG3-wild-type KCNQ1. Blotting with an anti-KCNQ1 antibody directed against a C-terminal epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California) identified the same bands with wild-type constructs, but not truncations, that lack the epitope (data not shown). When these conditions were then applied to cells transfected with wild-type or C-terminal truncated constructs (Fig. 2C), bands corresponding to monomers, dimers, trimers, and tetramers were detected (appropriately lower molecular weights with greater truncations). Thus, truncations that do not reach the cell surface can, nevertheless, assemble as tetramers. To address the site of intracellular retention, we co-transfected C-terminally truncated FLAG3-KCNQ1 mutants with the pEYFP-ER plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech), which encodes an EYFP fused to the ER-retention motif KDEL. The pattern of staining for non-trafficked C-terminal truncations and LQT1 mutants was nearly identical to that for EYFP-ER (Fig. 3, A and C), indicating these KCNQ1 constructs are retained in the ER. By contrast, FLAG3-tagged trafficking-competent constructs (including wild-type) displayed a staining pattern regionally different from those for the retained constructs (Fig. 3B) that extended beyond the ER (Fig. 3, A and B). Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis in 610–620 Does Not Identify a Single Residue Required for Trafficking—The fact that the Δ610–676 construct is not expressed on the cell surface while Δ621–676 is (Fig. 1C) raises the possibility that specific residues within the 610–620 segment mediate forward trafficking. We therefore generated further constructs by substituting alanine for the wild-type residue at each position in this region within the trafficking-competent Myc-Δ621–676 background. Cell surface staining of these 11 KCNQ1 constructs ranged from 25.9 ± 2.0 to 113.9 ± 4.0% (with Δ621–676 = 100% and non-transfected control = 0%). Thus, a single specific residue absolutely required for forward trafficking was not identified in the 610–621 region. We therefore turned our attention to the hypothesis that a secondary or tertiary structure in this region determines KCNQ1 trafficking. Evidence That a Putative C Terminus Coiled Coil Is Required for Trafficking—Secondary structure algorithms (pbil.ibcp.fr/) predict that the KCNQ1 C terminus contains multiple α-helices (Fig. 4A). In addition, tertiary structure algorithms (COILS, pbil.ibcp.fr/ and www.ch.embnet.org/) predict with >90% probability that the most C-terminal two α-helices (at positions 536–565 and 586–618) generate a coiled coil structure (Fig. 4B). Truncation at aa 610 leads to shortening of the last α-helix, raising the possibility that disrupting this structure, rather than a lack of specific aa sequence, might be responsible for mistrafficking. We next generated a construct in which aa 600–609, just upstream of the 610–620 region, was deleted in the Δ621–676 background. Structural predictions based on the algorithms listed above indicate that this 10-aa deletion disrupts the predicted coiled coil structure but preserves the α-helices. This construct displayed no cell surface expression, suggesting a key role for the coiled coil. Fig. 5 shows the results of further experiments for testing this idea. Two turns of the α-helix in the coiled coil encompass seven aa, with hydrophobic residues positioned every seven aa to form the hydrophobic interface characteristic of the coiled coil. To perturb the hydrophobic interface, we introduced six-, seven-, and eight-aa deletions in this region of the wild-type channel (Δ604–609, Δ603–609, and Δ602–609, respectively) and found that only the seven-aa-deleted protein reached the cell surface. A second seven-aa deletion, Δ602–608, also displayed normal cell surface expression, arguing against the idea that deletions from position 602 might generate a retention motif or destroy a forward trafficking motif. The findings were similar with the wild-type and Δ621–676 backgrounds.Fig. 5Effect of deletions within the predicted coiled coil on cell surface expression. The left column shows the predicted probability of a coiled coil for each construct. Cell surface expression data (middle columns) were obtained with c-Myc-tagged constructs in non-permeabilized cells; scale bars, 100 μm. Cell surface expression was normalized to wild-type KCNQ1 (= 1) and non-transfected control (= 0) in this and subsequent figures.

Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Mutations were therefore introduced at both Leu606 and Leu613 (in the same construct) in the Myc-Δ621–676 trafficking-competent background. Fig. 6B shows that cell surface expression was preserved with alanine substitutions at these positions. Because alanine is, like leucine, hydrophobic (27Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Franks F. Protein Biotechnology: Isolation, Characterization, and Stabilization. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 467-488Crossref Google Scholar), more severe mutations were introduced, i.e. proline to disrupt the α-helical structure (27Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Franks F. Protein Biotechnology: Isolation, Characterization, and Stabilization. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 467-488Crossref Google Scholar) and aspartate to disrupt the hydrophobic interface while preserving the α-helical structure (28Nilsson I. Saaf A. Whitley P. Gafvelin G. Waller C. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Neither construct was expressed on the cell surface. Similarly, when alanine was introduced at both Leu602 and Ile609, cell surface expression was retained, whereas with proline and aspartate substitutions at these positions it was not. We infer that cell surface expression requires not only the α-helical structure in this region but also the hydrophobic interface in this α-helix. Protein-Protein Interactions and Cell Surface Expression—Because leucine zippers represent molecular interaction sites (29Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 30Lupas A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that the KCNQ1 protein must interact with another protein to exit the ER and move to the cell surface. One candidate interacting protein is yotiao, a recently described A kinase anchoring protein partner of KCNQ1 (23Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). However, alanine mutations at Leu602 and Ile609, found previously to abolish the yotiao-KCNQ1 interaction (23Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), did not alter cell surface expression. Schmitt et al. (31Schmitt N. Schwarz M. Peretz A. Abitbol I. Attali B. Pongs O. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 332-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) have suggested that aa 590–620 serve as a tetramerization domain. This conclusion was based on studies showing that the Δ621–676 construct generated a current, whereas Δ590–676 did not, and that labeled peptides derived from this region interacted with each other. However, data in Fig. 2, B and C, indicate that truncated constructs that do not traffic to the cell surface can nevertheless assemble as multimers. To further address this possibility using the complete protein, we cotransfected C-terminal truncations tagged with FLAG3 and C-terminal truncations tagged with c-Myc, and studied their interactions using immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting; Fig. 7A shows the results of that experiment, demonstrating again that even trafficking-incompetent Δ590–676 channels interact with each other. Another candidate interactor is the β-subunit KCNE1. However, we found that KCNE1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with not only KCNQ1 wild-type and the Δ621–676 mutant but also with the trafficking-incompetent mutants Δ610–676, Δ600–676, and Δ590–676 (Fig. 7B).

The four mutants in the 587–594 segment displayed markedly reduced cell surface expression, whereas R539W, R555C, and R583C (which we and others have previously shown do generate IKs in heterologous expression systems) (24Yang P. Kanki H. Drolet B. Yang T. Wei J. Viswanathan P.C. Hohnloser S.H. Shimizu W. Schwartz P.J. Stanton M.S. Murray K.T. Norris K. George A.L.J. Roden D.M.

Circulation. 1997; 96: 2778-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) displayed near-normal cell surface expression with or without KCNE1 (Fig. 8A). No IKs was observed with G589D and R591H, whereas a small current (<10% of wild-type) was observed with R594Q (Fig. 8B). Although the predicted coil structure and the sites of these mutations are highly conserved across species, the structural algorithms do not predict disruption of the coiled coil with any of these point mutations; in fact, deletion of the proximal 11 residues of coil 2 still results in a predicted coil. We have demonstrated here that normal cell surface expression of KCNQ1 requires the region between residues 610 and 620, but not the terminal 56 aa. Engineered and naturally occurring mistrafficked mutations were retained in the ER; however, neither mutations of previously recognized trafficking motifs throughout KCNQ1 nor alanine-scanning mutagenesis in the 610–620 region identified the specific residues required for normal cell surface trafficking, leading us to hypothesize that the region itself must be intact for normal channel processing. We thus turned our attention to the possibility that a structural motif, rather than a specific aa sequence, is required to process the channel normally. Secondary structural algorithms predict that the KCNQ1 protein contains multiple α-helices in its C terminus and that the 610–620 region occupies the end of one of them. Moreover, this α-helix is also predicted to have the potential to form a coiled coil structure, which is known to act as a protein interaction cassette. Our finding that the deletion of seven, but not six or eight, aa in this region retains cell surface trafficking provides powerful support for this concept. The data presented in Fig. 5 support the idea that cell surface expression is dependent on the length of a deletion, arguing against a role for a specific amino acid residue (e.g. 609). Coiled coil structures are made up of two or more α-helices that assemble in either parallel or antiparallel orientations (38Monera O.D. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3862-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 39Monera O.D. Zhou N.E. Lavigne P. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3995-4001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 40Myszka D.G. Chaiken I.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2363-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The hallmark of the coiled coil is a heptad repeat with the aa designated a–g. Positions a and d are occupied by hydrophobic residues and form the helix interface (“core”), which is thought to interact with other hydrophobic regions on the same or different proteins, whereas b, c, e, f, and g are hydrophilic and form the solvent-exposed part of the helix surface (“coat-”) (29Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 41McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Because the number and orientation of the helices contained in the structure are determined by a combination of the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the core and the coat, the results of mutagenesis in the coiled coil are not readily predictable. In our experiments, channels with alanine substitutions for hydrophobic residues in the leucine zipper displayed cell surface expression. These alanine-substituted channels are predicted to retain the coiled coil structure, although interactions with proteins that bind to I/L/V heptad repeats may be reduced. By contrast, substitutions of proline (L603P + L613P and I609P), which will markedly kink an α-helix (27Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Franks F. Protein Biotechnology: Isolation, Characterization, and Stabilization. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 467-488Crossref Google Scholar), or the hydrophilic residue aspartate (L606D + L613D, L602D + I609D), which preserves α-helices but perturbs the hydrophobic interface, disrupted cell surface expression. These results further support the concept that the structural integrity of this region is a key determinant of normal KCNQ1 processing. In some proteins, subcellular trafficking and localization require protein-protein interactions through coiled coil regions (42Zhong Q. Lazar C.S. Tronchere H. Sato T. Meerloo T. Yeo M. Songyang Z.

Thus, in the KCNQ1 protein the requirement for the coiled coil structure suggests a key protein-protein interaction at this site. The interacting protein could serve a number of functions, such as occluding an ER retention motif elsewhere on the channel, promoting appropriate folding, or providing a suitable forward trafficking motif. We have considered three candidates as potential interacting proteins at this site, i.e. other KCNQ1 subunits, KCNE1, and yotiao. However, our experiments do not implicate any of these three as the trafficking-modulating associated partner protein. Three of the LQTS mutants displayed cell surface expression comparable that of with wild-type. Each of these three displays a mild clinical phenotype, and two of them are exposed only by drug challenge (24Yang P. Kanki H. Drolet B. Yang T. Wei J. Viswanathan P.C. Hohnloser S.H. Shimizu W.

One feature of these variants is that they shift the voltage dependence of IKs activation positive (24Yang P. Kanki H. Drolet B. Yang T. Wei J. Viswanathan P.C. Hohnloser S.H. Shimizu W.

Our finding here that a cluster of four LQT1 mutations in the distal coil all reduce IKs by decreasing cell surface expression raises the possibility of a disrupted structure in this region as a common mechanism.

Mouse and human deoxy-Ngb display hexacordinated hemochrome-binding schemes at the Fe2+ (17Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Google Scholar, 18Trent III, J.T. Hargrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19538-19545Google Scholar). The proximal histidine can be replaced by an external ligand such as O2, resulting in an oxygen affinity (P50) of ∼1–2 torr, similar to that of myoglobin (6Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Google Scholar, 17Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Google Scholar). Initially, Ngb was found to be predominantly expressed in the brains of man and mouse (6Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Google Scholar), but recent analyses show Ngb to be also present in the peripheral nervous system and some non-neuronal endocrine tissues (19Reuss S. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Weich B. Wystrub S. Reuss M. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Neuroscience. 2002; 115: 645-656Google Scholar, 20Geuens E. Brouns I. Flamez D. Dewilde S. Timmermans J.P. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30417-30420Google Scholar, 21Wystub S. Laufs T. Schmidt M. Burmester T. Maas U. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Reuss S. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 346: 114-116Google Scholar). Particularly high amounts of Ngb were observed in the mammalian retina where it could reach a concentration similar to that of myoglobin in muscle cells (14Schmidt M. Gieβl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Google Scholar). This study also suggests that, at the subcellular level, Ngb is localized adjacent to the mitochondria. In cultured neuronal cells from the mouse brain, synthesis of Ngb is enhanced under low oxygen conditions (12Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Google Scholar), although these results could not been confirmed by in vivo studies (22Mammen P.P.A. Shelton J.M. Goetsch S.C. Williams S.C. Richardson J.A. Garry M.G. Garry D.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 1591-1598Google Scholar). The presence of Ngb promotes the survival of cultured neuronal cells at low oxygen levels, and overexpression of Ngb may protect neurons from hypoxic-ischemic injury in vitro and in vivo (12Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Google Scholar, 15Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Google Scholar). The available data suggest that Ngb expression levels correlate with high oxygen consumption rates, implying an important role of Ngb in neuronal O2 supply, although other functions of Ngb are still conceivable (13Pesce A. Bolognesi M. Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Dewilde S. Moens L. Hankeln T. Burmester T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1146-1151Google Scholar, 23Wakasugi K. Nakano T. Morishima I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36505-36512Google Scholar). Whereas Ngb was originally identified in mammalian species (6Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Google Scholar), it is also present in fishes (24Awenius C. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 418-421Google Scholar), suggesting a widespread occurrence in vertebrates. The investigation of Ngb function in non-mammalian species is an essential prerequisite for the understanding of its role in the vertebrate metabolism. Here, we have carried out a detailed genetic, biochemical, and expressional analysis of Ngb from the zebrafish Danio rerio. Cloning and Sequencing of D. rerio Ngb cDNA and Gene—D. rerio were kept at 28 °C in a freshwater aquarium. Genomic DNA of D. rerio was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy kit. Several oligonucleotide primers were designed according to the Ngb cDNA sequence (24Awenius C. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 418-421Google Scholar) and partial data base entries of the zebrafish Ngb gene. Overlapping fragments were amplified using the SAWADY “Mid Range” PCR system (PeqLab). The sequences were obtained after the cloning of the PCR products into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). 5′-RACE experiments were carried out with the Invitrogen kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using ∼1 μg of D. rerio total RNA and three nested oligonucleotide primers. Sequences were obtained either directly from the PCR products or after cloning into the pCR4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequences were analyzed by applying the GeneDoc 2.6 (25Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield D.W. The European Molecular Biology Network Newsletter. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar), MatInspector V2.2 (26Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Google Scholar), and BLAST searches (27Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) using Eukaryotic Promoter Data base, release 76 (28Périer R.C. Praz V. Junier T. Bonnard C. Bucher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 302-303Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ngb—The complete D. rerio Ngb cDNA was cloned into the pET3a expression vector (Novagen) using PCR-generated NdeI and BglII restriction sites. The plasmid was transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys strain and grown at 25 °C in TBY medium (0.5% NaCl, 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, pH 7.4) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 1 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid. The culture was induced at A600 = 0.8 by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.4 mm and grown overnight. The bacteria were harvested by a 20-min centrifugation at 4,322 × g and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 8 μg/ml DNase, and 4 μg/ml RNase supplemented with Complete™ proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and Pefabloc (Roche Applied Science). The cells were broken by three freeze-thaw cycles in fluid nitrogen followed by ultrasonication (10 × 30 s). The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C to digest the DNA and RNA. The cell debris was removed by a centrifugation for 1 h at 4 °C at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. The reddish 60–70% ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and desalted using an Amicon Ultra filter (Millipore). Further purification of Ngb was achieved by a DEAE ion-exchange column with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Size exclusion chromatography was carried out using a High Load™ 26/60 Superdex™ 75 prep grade (Amersham Biosciences). The final Ngb fractions were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, pooled, concentrated, and stored frozen at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) method. Absorption Spectra and Ligand-binding Kinetics—The spectral forms were determined on a Cary400 or HP8453 spectrometer. The main characteristic differing from human hemoglobin is the deoxy form, which has the enhanced α and Soret band characteristic of the hexacoordinated species. The CO-bound form can be photodissociated to follow the subsequent competitive rebinding of CO and the distal histidine. A 10-ns yttrium aluminium garnet laser at 532 nm was used for photodissociation. A monochromatic detection beam was used consisting of a 50-watt quartz halogen lamp with an interference filter. Antibody Preparation and Western Blotting—Purified recombinant D. rerio Ngb was used to raise a polyclonal antibody in rabbits. Specific antibodies were affinity-purified from the crude rabbit serum using recombinant D. rerio Ngb coupled to a SulfoLink column (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody was stored at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris, 100 mm glycine, ∼pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.1% NaN3. For Western blotting, selected tissues were homogenized in 1% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 65 mm Tris, pH 6.8. The samples were heat-denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded to a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Antibody detection was carried out on protein samples transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation for 2 h with 2% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.3% Tween 20). The membranes were incubated with anti-Ngb antibodies diluted 1:2,000 in 2% milk/TBST. The membranes were washed four times for 10 min in TBST and incubated with the goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled with alkaline phosphatase (Dianova). The filters were washed in TBST as above, and detection was carried out with either nitro blue tetrazolium chloride or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate as substrates. In Situ Hybridization—The DNA template for generating an Ngb antisense RNA probe was produced by PCR, attaching the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence to the 3′ end of the Ngb cDNA. Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA was then generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Control sense RNA probe was created using a cDNA carrying the T7 promoter sequence at the 5′ end. Two specimens of D. rerio were prepared by freezing the animals on dry ice and decapitating them. Frontal cryosections (15 μm) were mounted onto slides coated with aminosilane and stored at –80 °C. Prior to hybridization, the sections were postfixed for 15 min in 4% formaldehyde/PBS and washed 2 × 5 min in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and 5 min in PBS. Hybridization with labeled RNA probes was carried out at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 2× SSC. Sense probes and hybridization mixtures completely lacking probe RNA were used as negative controls. Slides were washed for 3 × 5 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 20 min in 0.1× SSC at 60 °C and subsequently treated for 15 min at 37 °C with RNase A in 2× SSC. After washing 3 × 5 min with 2× SSC and 5 min in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, nonspecific antibody binding sites were blocked with 1% blocking reagent (Roche Applied Science), 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Specimens were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) coupled with alkaline phosphatase (diluted 1:100 in PBS) and washed 2 × 5 min in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin and 5 min in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 50 mm MgCl2. Detection was carried out using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The reaction was stopped by washing in PBS, and preparations were mounted in 50% glycerol/PBS and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Neuroanatomical regions were identified by the aid of the brain atlas by Wullimann et al. (30Wullimann M.F. Rupp B. Reichert H. Neuroanatomy of the Zebrafish Brain: A Topological Atlas. Birkhäuser, Basel, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Studies—Tissues were fixed for 8 h or overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl). Cryosections (12 μm) were prepared and placed onto glass slides coated with chromalaun gelatin. Nonspecific binding sides were blocked for 15 min in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% TritonX-100 in PBS. The sections were incubated with anti-Ngb antibodies (1:20–1:50) in the blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed 3 × 8 min in PBS. Incubation with the secondary antibody coupled with Cy3 (Dianova), diluted 1:500 in blocking solution, was carried out for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The sections were washed 3 × 8 min in PBS, mounted in Elvanol polyvinyl alcohol (Mowiol, Calbiochem), and examined with a Leitz DM RD microscope. The D. rerio Neuroglobin Gene—The nucleotide sequence of zebrafish Ngb cDNA has been determined previously (24Awenius C. Hankeln T. Burmester T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 418-421Google Scholar). We designed multiple primers that allowed the amplification of overlapping fragments from the D. rerio Ngb gene. The sequences of the PCR fragments are essentially identical (>99%) with the sequence of clone CH211-233N24 from the zebrafish genome project (Sanger Institute). Within the Ngb coding region, only at the third nucleotide of codon 153, a silent C→T transition was observed (Supplemental Fig. S1). Putative mRNA transcription start sites were determined by 5′-RACE experiments and deduced from the longest expressed sequence tags (fr71g03.y1, fr74a03.y1, and fr73f03.y1). Counting from the 5′ most transcription start site to the poly(A) tail, the zebrafish Ngb gene covers a total of 6286 bp (Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. S1). A comparison of the genomic sequences with the cDNA reveals the presence of four introns. The second, third, and fourth introns are positioned within the coding region at exactly the same positions as in the human and mouse neuroglobin genes (6Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Google Scholar) as follows: B12.2 (i.e. between codon positions 2 and 3 of the 12th amino acid of the globin helix B); E11.0; and G7.0. An additional intron of 184 bp is located at bp 119 in the 5′-non-coding region, whereas the start ATG was found at position 446. Thus, the D. rerio Ngb mRNA covers 2640 bp, including a 5′-untranslated region of 261 bp and a 3′-untranslated region of 1899 bp. The expressed sequence tags in the sequence databases show the presence of another transcribed region of unknown function 1.5 kb upstream to the Danio Ngb gene (data not shown), thus delimiting the 5′-regulatory sequences of the Ngb gene. This upstream region, putatively encompassing the Ngb promoter, was compared with the Eukaryotic Promoter Data base, which is an annotated collection of eukaryotic PolII promoters with experimentally determined transcription start sites (28Périer R.C. Praz V. Junier T. Bonnard C. Bucher P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 302-303Google Scholar). In this analysis, the upstream region revealed significant similarities with various PolII promoter regions. In particular, the promoters of mouse myoglobin and rabbit β-hemoglobin gave significant scores (E = 2 × 10–13 and E = 2 × 10–7), indicating the integrity of the predicted transcription start site. Further inspections of the 5′-upstream sequences of the zebrafish Ngb gene show that the putative promoter lacks a TATA box, whereas multiple other regulatory sequences such as GATA-binding sites, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, and CAAT box are present (Supplemental Table S1). Two putative neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSEs) were also identified in the Ngb promoter region (Fig. 1). The Ngb gene plus the upstream and downstream genomic regions were scanned for the presence of putative hypoxia-responsive sequence elements (HREs). HREs in hypoxia-regulated genes are defined by the binding motif of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 (5′-RCGTG-3′) (31Wenger R.H. Gassmann M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 609-616Google Scholar). Typically, an HRE includes two HIF-1 motifs (in direct or inverted orientation) or one HIF-1 motif combined with an erythropoietin (EPO) box (32Semenza G.L. Jiang B.-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J.-P. Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Google Scholar) or a HIF ancillary sequence (33Kimura H. Weisz A. Ogura T. Hitomi Y. Kurashina Y. Hashimoto K. D'Acquisto F. Makuuchi M. Esumi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 273: 2292-2298Google Scholar). Five such closely spaced motif combinations are present in the zebrafish Ngb gene region (Fig. 1). Ligand-binding Kinetics of Zebrafish Neuroglobin—The Danio Ngb was expressed using the pET3a vector system. The recombinant protein was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography (Supplemental Fig. S2). The ferrous deoxy form of Ngb shows a typical hexacoordinated absorption spectrum (Fig. 2A) as characterized by large amplitudes for the α band (560 nm) and the Soret band (426 nm) (17Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Google Scholar). The kinetics after CO photodissociation revealed a biphasic form. The rapid phase is competitive binding of CO or the distal histidine residue. For higher CO levels, the rate and relative amplitude of this phase increases. At low CO levels, the histidine binding becomes more competitive and the slow phase becomes more prominent. The slow phase involves the replacement of the histidine by CO and requires several seconds for a complete return to the initial CO-bound state. From the kinetics at various CO levels, one can extract the CO on-rate and the histidine both on-rate and off-rate (Table I). Similarly, competition of oxygen and CO can be used to obtain the rate coefficients for oxygen. Note that two ligand affinities are given in the table. The intrinsic affinity is the ratio of the binding rates for a given ligand. This would be the affinity in the absence of competing ligand. The overall oxygen affinity, taking into account the competing histidine ligand, is calculated to be ∼1 torr, similar to human NGB without dithiothreitol (34Hamdane D. Kiger L. Dewilde S. Green B.N. Pesce A. Uzan J. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Bolognesi M. Moens L. Marden M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51713-51721Google Scholar). With dithiothreitol, the disulfide bond is broken and human NGB shows a lower oxygen affinity. This effect was not observed for Danio Ngb.Table ILigand binding parameters to NgbCOOxygenHistidineO2konkonkoffKdkonkoffKaP50μm/ssnmstorrDanio702500.31.32500212500.9Human NgbaHamdane et al.

Open table in a new tab Detection of Ngb Protein in Zebrafish Tissues—Specific antibodies against recombinant zebrafish Ngb were raised in rabbits and further purified by affinity chromatography. In Western blotting, these antibodies detect the recombinant Ngb at ∼16 kDa (Fig. 3A). Ngb was also stained by the antibody in extracts from the brain, the total eye, and the gills but not in the muscle or the blood. As already observed in mouse (14Schmidt M. Gieβl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Google Scholar), the apparent molecular mass of the native Ngb is slightly higher than that of the recombinant protein. The reason for this discrepancy is still unknown but may be explained by posttranslational modifications. After preadsorption of the antibodies with the antigen, the Ngb band disappeared in Western blots of retinal and brain tissues, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-Ngb antibodies. To investigate whether Ngb may be released from the cells, the total brain was incubated for 2 h in PBS. However, no Ngb could be detected in the supernatant while there was a signal in the brain extracts (Fig. 3B). Expression Pattern of Danio Ngb by mRNA in Situ Hybridization—To localize the sites of Ngb mRNA expression in zebrafish, frontal cryosections of head regions were analyzed by in situ hybridization (ISH) using an in vitro transcribed antisense RNA probe. Cross-sections from several layers were inspected (Supplemental Fig. S3). A perinuclear signal typical for mRNA hybridization of Ngb was found in the neuronal somata of essentially all of the regions of the Danio brain (Fig. 4) (see also Supplemental Fig. S4 and Supplemental Table S2). Control experiments that included nonspecific RNA (mouse intestine total RNA) as competitor showed identical staining (data not shown). Sections hybridized with an in vitro transcribed sense RNA probe showed no staining (Supplemental Fig. S5), thus demonstrating the specificity of the Ngb labeling. For example, in a section of the posterior mesencephalon (Fig. 4), we found a particularly strong Ngb signal in the periventral zone of the tectum opticum. Additional staining was observed in putative neurons scattered in the white matter of the brain and in neuronal populations such as the preglomerular nucleus, posterior tubular nucleus, the torus longitudinalis, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary gland. An examination of further frontal sections showed the presence of Ngb mRNA in various brain regions (Supplemental Fig. S4 and Supplemental Table S2), e.g. Ngb mRNA was also detected in brain regions of the visual system, predominantly in parts of the tectum opticum and the torus semicircularis, which are both part of the mesencephalon. ISH signal was also present in two other regions involved in visual signal processing, the area dorsalis telencephali of the telencephalon and the medulla oblongata, a part of the rhombencephalon. The other parts of the Danio brain in which strong ISH signals were observed included parts of the telencephalic area dorsalis telencephali, the diencephalic posterior tuberculum, the hypothalamus, and the synencephalon. In the rhombencephalon, which includes the metencephalon and the myelencephalon, signals could be seen in the formatio reticularis. Ngb ISH staining was also noticed in the telencephalon, containing the bulbus olfactorius (Fig. 5A). Intense Ngb ISH signal could be detected in the sensory epithelium of the peripheral olfactory organ. Strong Ngb mRNA labeling was also observed in distinct layers of the zebrafish retina (Fig. 5B). The outer and inner nuclear layers, which contain the nuclei, and the ganglion cell layer were heavily stained with the Ngb probe, whereas the outer plexiform layer and the outer segments of the photoreceptor cells appeared to be unstained. The head cross-sections revealed that Ngb is also present in the gills (Fig. 5C). The ISH signal appeared to be limited to the chloride cells that were located mainly at the base and the lateral regions of the secondary lamella. Immunodetection of Danio Ngb Protein—The presence of the Ngb protein in zebrafish tissues was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence experiments. An affinity purified α-Danio Ngb antibody was applied on cryosections from both fixed and unfixed tissues. In agreement with the mRNA ISH data, we observed scattered Ngb immune reactivity of the brain neurons. Particularly strong staining of neurons was observed in the diencephalic lateral hypothalamus (Fig. 6A). In control experiments without first antibody, no staining of the neurons was observed (Fig. 6B). In the retina, no anti-Ngb immune staining was found either in the cells of the retinal pigment epithelium or in the outer segments of the photoreceptors. Bright immune staining was observed in the photoreceptor layer, whereas there was little but detectable immune reaction in the outer and inner plexiform layers and at the ganglion cells (Fig. 6C). No signal was present in the appropriate control experiments (not shown). In the gills, we observed scattered staining of cells that most probably corresponded to the chloride cells of the secondary lamella (F"

In all cases, the substrate was unmodified in the most populated reaction intermediate, and no chemically modified substrate species accumulated to a detectable amount. The cephalosporins tested showed similar formation rate constants for this intermediate, and they differed mostly in their decay rates. Formation of a non-productive enzyme ·substrate complex was detected for imipenem. The substrate binding differences can be accounted for by considering the structural features of each substrate. The apoenzyme could not bind any of the substrates, but binding was restored when the apoenzyme was reconstituted with Zn(II), revealing that the metal ions are the main determinants of substrate binding. This evidence is in line with the lack of an optimized substrate recognition patch in B1 and B3 metallo-β-lactamases that provides a broad substrate spectrum.

This evidence is in line with the lack of an optimized substrate recognition patch in B1 and B3 metallo-β-lactamases that provides a broad substrate spectrum. The most prevalent mechanism of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics is the production of β-lactamases (1Frère J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 2Bush K. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 839-845PubMed Google Scholar), which inactivate these drugs by hydrolyzing the active β-lactam bond. Metallo-β-lactamases (class B β-lactamases) constitute a distinct class within this family of enzymes (3Cricco J.A. Vila A.J. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 915-927PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wang Z. Fast W.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 660-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In most cases, these metalloenzymes exhibit a broad substrate spectrum, being able to hydrolyze most of the β-lactam antibiotics currently available (Fig. 1) (6Felici A. Amicosante G. Oratore A.

The spread of metallo-β-lactamase genes among pathogenic bacterial strains is raising an increasing concern in the biomedical community because no clinically useful inhibitors have yet been developed. Metallo-β-lactamases are classified in three groups according to sequence homology: subclasses B1, B2, and B3 (5Galleni M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Rossolini G.M. Spencer J. Dideberg O. Frère J.M.

All class B lactamases share a common fold, and the residues that constitute the metal binding site are mostly conserved, although the overall sequence similarity among them is low. In all structures but one, two Zn(II) ions are found in the active site. One of the metal ions (Zn1) is bound to three histidine residues of the protein and a water molecule (17Carfi A. Pares S.

All characterized inhibitors are able to bind the active site metal ions. Docking studies of substrates on the three-dimensional structures of these enzymes have been performed to delineate the interactions responsible for substrate binding and catalysis (18Concha N.

Proteins. 2004; 54: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In subclass B1 lactamases, the conserved residue Lys-224 is thought to bind the substrate carboxylate. Aside from this residue, no single group of residues can account for binding of the widely differing, efficiently hydrolyzed substrates, leaving an open question on the main determinants of substrate binding by class B lactamases. The hydrolysis of β-lactams by metallo-β-lactamases is thought to be similar to the base-catalyzed hydrolysis (30Page M.I. The Chemsitry of β-Lactams. Blackie Academic & Professional, Glasgow, Scotland, UK1992Crossref Google Scholar, 31Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 703-711Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar). It proceeds through an initial nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the substrate by the zinc-bound water/hydroxide moiety, leading to the formation of a tetrahedral intermediate. Presteady state kinetic studies on the subclass B1 metallo-β-lactamases from B. fragilis (CcrA) and from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (IMP-1) and the subclass B3 enzyme from Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (L1) have demonstrated that the hydrolysis of the chromophoric cephalosporin nitrocefin proceeds through an anionic intermediate in most cases (32Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 10788-10789Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 33Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J.

However, Spencer and co-workers (37Spencer J. Clarke A.R. Walsh T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33638-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have demonstrated for the L1 enzyme that the formation of this intermediate is not a general feature of β-lactam hydrolysis catalyzed by metallo-β-lactamases but is rather due to the particular chemical nature of nitrocefin, which allows the stabilization of the negative charge on the nitrogen atom through an extended π-delocalization. In the same study, the β-lactam cleavage was identified as the rate-limiting step for the hydrolysis of another cephalosporin, cefaclor, and for the carbapenem substrate meropenem. Presteady state kinetic studies on the hydrolysis of nitrocefin and benzylpenicillin by Zn-BcII have also been carried at sub-zero temperatures using cryosolvents (38Bicknell R. Waley S.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6876-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Altogether, the information gathered in the above mentioned studies points to the existence of a mechanistic heterogeneity in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics catalyzed by metallo-β-lactamases caused both by differences in the active sites of the enzymes and in the structures of the substrates. With the aim of generating a more complete picture of β-lactam binding and hydrolysis by metallo-β-lactamases, we studied the presteady state kinetics of the reaction of BcII with clinically used antibiotics: benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, cephapirin, and imipenem. We were not able to detect any spectroscopically distinguishable intermediate during the hydrolysis of any of the substrates. Analysis of the substrate binding kinetics showed a marked heterogeneity among these β-lactams. Finally the apoenzyme could not bind any of the substrates tested, indicating that the metal ions play a crucial role in substrate binding to BcII. Reagents—All chemicals were of the best quality available. Benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, and cephapirin were purchased from Sigma. 10–20 mm stock solutions of benzylpenicillin, cefotaxime, and cephapirin and 5–10 mm stock solutions of imipenem were prepared in distilled water. Benzylpenicillin stocks were not stored; cefotaxime and cephapirin stocks were stored at –20 °C for no longer than 1 week, and imipenem stocks were stored at –70 °C for no longer than 1 week. The concentrations of the stock solutions were determined spectrophotometrically, measuring the ΔA at λmax after complete hydrolysis catalyzed by BcII. The following values of Δϵλmax were used: benzylpenicillin, Δϵ235 = –800 m–1·cm–1; cefotaxime, Δϵ262 = –7500 m–1·cm–1; cephapirin, Δϵ259 = –7000 m–1·cm–1; and imipenem, Δϵ300 = –9000 m–1·cm–1. Preparations of Enzyme Samples—Expression and purification of BcII were performed as reported previously (11Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Purity of the enzyme preparations was checked by SDS-PAGE. Protein samples used in all experiments reported were exchanged from the final purification buffer to 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, using a HiPrep® 26/10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) or by two dialysis steps against >100 volumes of the same buffer. Buffer solutions were treated by stirring with Chelex to remove traces of divalent metal ions. The Zn(II) content was measured using the colorimetric reagent 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol in denaturing conditions (16Fast W. Wang Z. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 39Tanaka M. Funahashi S. Shirai K. Inorg. Chem. 1968; 7: 573-578Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Hunt J.B.

A 6-h treatment of the native enzyme samples with 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol in the same buffer used for kinetic determinations removed ∼0.3 eq of Zn(II)/enzyme, indicating that they were loosely bound. Apoenzymes were obtained as described previously (42de Seny D. Heinz U. Wommer S. Kiefer M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Galleni M. Frère J.M. Bauer R. Adolph H.W. J. Biol.

Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically using ϵ280 = 30,500 m–1·cm–1 (12Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D.

Presteady State Kinetic Measurements and Data Analysis—Experiments were carried on an Applied Photophysics SX.18-MVR stopped-flow spectrometer. Inner tubing of the apparatus, syringes, and valves are devoid of metallic surfaces. Enzyme fluorescence measurements were performed by excitation at 280 nm (slit width = 0.5 mm) and detection through a cut-off filter at >305 nm. The photomultiplier voltage was set to obtain a 4.0- or 0.8-V signal with the free enzyme. The background signal obtained after washing the observation cell with buffer ranged within 2–5% of the enzyme signal. Absorbance changes were measured at the corresponding λmax for each substrate using an absorption photomultiplier. The absorbance reference was set to the final absorbance value measured after completion of the reaction. For both absorbance and fluorescence measurements, the excitation/absorption pathlength was 0.2 cm. All reactions were performed in 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, without extra Zn(II) added except when indicated. The whole sample head was kept at 15 °C using a Lauda RC6 thermostatted circulator. Kinetic runs under pseudo-first order conditions to follow substrate binding were performed by mixing 2 or 4 μm enzyme solutions with 10–160 μm substrate (syringe concentrations) and measuring the protein intrinsic fluorescence on a split time base. 20 runs were averaged for all tested conditions due to the low amplitude of the signal obtained and the high observed rate constants even at low substrate concentration. For the cephalosporin substrates, the enzyme fluorescence quenching was satisfactorily fitted to simple exponential functions. A simple reaction scheme was assumed for these substrates (Scheme 1). A linear fit of the data points was therefore performed to calculate k–1 + kcat and k+1. Subtraction of the kcat value obtained from steady state experiments allowed us to calculate an estimate for k–1. The reaction rates for imipenem hydrolysis were obtained from a global analysis of fluorescence and absorption reaction traces at different substrate concentration using the software DynaFit (43Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). In all cases, the enzyme fluorescence was followed until the substrate was fully consumed. The final part of the reactions (when the substrate concentration is well below the Km value) were fitted to single exponential functions, and the whole reaction curves were normalized by subtraction of the estimated final fluorescence value. This allowed us to evaluate the amplitude of the quenching process for cefotaxime, cephapirin, and imipenem where inner filter effects due to absorption of the substrate at the excitation wavelength were estimated to be negligible. The quenching amplitudes can be correlated to the maximum fraction of enzyme that binds substrate at a given substrate concentration (44Auld D.S. Latt S.A. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the quenching amplitudes were fitted to the following function, Q=Qmax/(1+Ks/[S]) where Q is the observed quenching amplitude and Qmax is the expected fluorescence quenching at saturating substrate concentration, to obtain values of the fraction of fluorescence quenched in the E·C* complex and of the apparent equilibrium constant KS. Single turnover experiments were performed at enzyme concentrations of 20 or 60 μm and at substrate concentrations of 10 or 30 μm, respectively. For all β-lactams tested, both substrate consumption and enzyme fluorescence were recorded. Fluorescence recovery and the whole absorbance curves were fitted to single exponential functions. Steady state kinetic parameters in the same conditions used for the presteady state experiments were obtained by recording and analyzing the whole reaction time courses of substrate consumption or by fitting the initial rates of hydrolysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The steady state rate equations were obtained with the computer program Albass (45Varon-Castellanos R. Garcia-Moreno M. Garcia-Sevilla F. Ruiz-Galea M.M. Garcia-Casanovas F. Computerized Derivation of the Steady-State Equations of Enzyme Reactions. Albacete, Spain1995Google Scholar). Substrate Binding—Spencer and co-workers (37Spencer J. Clarke A.R. Walsh T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33638-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have recently shown that the intrinsic fluorescence of the metallo-β-lactamase L1 from S. maltophilia is substantially quenched during substrate binding, thus providing an efficient way to follow this process. We used the same strategy with BcII, which shows an identical behavior upon binding of all substrates tested by us. The initial fast quenching process could be followed for the two cephalosporins, but in the case of penicillin and imipenem this event was too fast to be monitored since it occurred during the dead time of the instrument (Fig. 2). To evaluate the rate constants for the binding of cephalosporins, fluorescence quenching was monitored under pseudo-first order conditions, and the experimental curves were fitted to single exponential functions. The observed pseudo-first order rate constants for both cefotaxime and cephapirin binding increased linearly with increasing substrate concentration in the working substrate range (Fig. 3). Determinations at higher substrate concentrations were attempted, but the reaction rates were too high to allow a reliable fit. The linear increase of the observed rate constants with substrate concentration suggests a simple one-step binding process (Scheme 1) for which both k+1 and k–1 could be estimated (Table I).Table ISubstrate binding rate constantsSubstratek+1k-1KSQmaxμm-1·s-1s-1μm%Cefotaxime31 ± 3240 ± 8014 ± 218Cephapirin32 ± 5610 ± 15021 ± 119 Open table in a new tab The fluorescence quenching amplitude measured at different substrate concentrations can be exploited to estimate the fraction of protein fluorescence quenched in the E·C* complex (Qmax) and the apparent reversible substrate binding equilibrium constant KS (44Auld D.S. Latt S.A. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4994-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The normalized amplitudes were fitted as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding Qmax and the constant KS (Supplemental Fig. S1 and Table I). Imipenem binding to BcII followed by enzyme fluorescence quenching revealed a biexponential behavior. First, a very fast (close to the detection limit) initial quenching process occurred followed by a further decrease in the protein fluorescence emission at a slow rate (∼8 s–1) before fluorescence was recovered due to substrate depletion (Fig. 4). The finding of a fast initial binding step is consistent with the high Km and kcat values of this substrate. The second process, however, was too slow to be included in a linear reaction pathway since the turnover number for imipenem hydrolysis is 122 s–1. The simplest reaction schemes that can account for these observations are those shown in Scheme 2 that include formation of a non-productive enzyme·substrate complex (E·Im2). The whole reaction time courses for imipenem hydrolysis and protein intrinsic fluorescence quenching were globally fitted to this reaction scheme. It was assumed that the absorptivity of the β-lactam chromophore is unaltered in both the non-productive (E·Im2) and the productive (E·Im1) complexes compared with free imipenem. Initial guesses for the relative quenching amplitudes were obtained from the biexponential fits of the first 0.3 s of the fluorescence signal. The value of k+1 was fixed as diffusion-limited (108m–1·s–1), and all other kinetic constants were fitted simultaneously to all data sets. The resulting fit and the obtained rate constants are displayed in Fig. 4.Scheme 2Proposed kinetic schemes for imipenem hydrolysis by BcII. The non-productive E ·Im2 complex was formed by direct binding to the free enzyme (A) or by reorganization of the productive E ·Im1 complex (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Apo and Zn(II)-reconstituted BcII—To evaluate the influence of the metal ions in substrate binding, the same experiments were carried with apoenzymes using cefotaxime, benzylpenicillin, and imipenem as substrates. No quenching of the apoenzyme intrinsic fluorescence was detected after mixing with any of the mentioned substrates. In all cases, a residual substrate hydrolysis was detected that was attributable to the presence of a small fraction of Zn-enzyme in the apoenzyme preparations. The same apoenzyme preparations were reconstituted with excess Zn(II) (10 μm Zn(II), ∼5 eq). Fig. 5 shows that substrate binding was restored in the reconstituted apoenzyme. Quenching of the enzyme fluorescence occurs before the substrate undergoes any chemical modifications (see below). These observations indicate that apoBcII cannot bind any of the substrates tested. β-Lactam Hydrolysis—All substrates were assayed under single turnover conditions following both substrate consumption and enzyme fluorescence. The rates of fluorescence recovery after the initial quenching and of β-lactam hydrolysis (followed by absorbance) were almost identical in all cases (Table II).Table IISingle turnover dataSubstratekobs fluor.kobs, subst.s-1CefotaximeaReaction of 30 μm BcII with 15 μm substrates.8590CephapirinaReaction of 30 μm BcII with 15 μm substrates.6167ImipenembReaction of 25 μm BcII with 10 μm substrates.1518a Reaction of 30 μm BcII with 15 μm substrates.b Reaction of 25 μm BcII with 10 μm substrates. Open table in a new tab The first step in the hydrolysis reaction, i.e. formation of a tetrahedral gem-diol intermediate after nucleophilic attack by the enzyme, is expected to result in a modification of the substrate spectrum. The fact that both the fluorescence recovery and changes in substrate absorbance proceeded at the same rates indicates that quenching of the enzyme intrinsic fluorescence occurs before the substrate has undergone any chemical reaction and that the fluorescence decay is mainly due to substrate binding. Although it is evident that the rate-limiting step should happen after substrate binding, the present data do not allow us to make any inference on the nature of the rate-limiting step as none of the putative reaction intermediates seemed to reach a concentration high enough to be detected. Hydrolysis of imipenem measured under single turnover conditions did not show biphasic fluorescence curves (Supplemental Fig. S2). In the presence of excess enzyme, the substrate is expected to be hydrolyzed through the fast, direct reaction path and be depleted before any significant amount of the non-productive complex is formed. To verify this assertion, the expected fluorescence and absorbance traces were calculated using the rate constants obtained under pseudo-first order conditions for this reaction. Only the quantum yields of the E·Im1 and E·Im2 complexes were allowed to vary to fit the experimental data. The steady state kinetic parameters for the reaction of BcII with the assayed substrates were measured in the same reaction conditions. The estimated values are in good agreement with the parameters calculated with the steady state rate equations using the values obtained for the individual rate constants (Table III).Table IIISteady state kinetic parameters at 15 °CSubstratekcatKmCal"

PrPsc is considered a hallmark for TSEs and is derived from the normal form of the prion protein (PrPc) through post-translational modifications that induce a conformational change and confer on it a partial resistance to degradation by proteases, as well as a marked insolubility in the presence of detergents. In brain homogenates or extracts, PrPsc is present as large aggregates named scrapie-associated fibrils (SAFs). PrPsc is the only direct unambiguous marker known for TSEs, and its detection is the basis of most diagnostic tests for prion diseases. Because PrPc is always present in tissues expressing PrPsc, specific detection is currently achieved after a proteinase K treatment, which completely degrades the cellular form of PrP and spares most of PrPsc sequence. In recent years, several papers (1Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R.

Surprisingly, the first mAb described (15B3) was obtained after an immunization with bovine recombinant PrP, which is not supposed to mimic any of the characteristic features of PrPsc (1Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The approach described by Paramithiotis et al. (2Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K. Tonelli Q. Ledebur H.C. Chakrabartty A. Cashman N.R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) is founded on the hypothesis that a linear epitope containing the YY (R or Q) motif is specifically exposed in PrPsc. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies produced by immunization with a synthetic peptide (CYYRRYYRYY) were shown to specifically immunoprecipitate PrPsc. To clarify the mechanism by which mAbs can interact with SAFs as found in a TSE-infected brain, we have screened a large series of mAbs of various specificities. We have been able to show that antibodies unrelated to PrP can efficiently and selectively immunoprecipitate PrPsc versus PrPc from a TSE-infected brain by interactions that do not imply the paratope of the antibodies. Brain Samples—Sheep brain samples were kindly provided by Olivier Andréoletti (INRA/ENVT, Toulouse, France). Scrapie-infected brain was from a VRQ/VRQ animal naturally infected with the Langlade isolate (5Andreoletti O. Berthon P. Marc D. Sarradin P. Grosclaude J. van Keulen L. Schelcher F. Elsen J.M. Lantier F. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 3115-3126Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)-infected human brain were provided by Professor Hans A. Kretzshmar (Institut für Neuropathologie, Munchen, Germany) and human non-infected brain by Dr. Armand Perret-Liaudet (Hôpital Neurologique et Neurochirurgical, CHU Lyon, France). In both the human and sheep brain, we verified that PrPc levels in non-infected brain were higher than in the infected brain. This clearly appears in Fig. 1 looking at the results recorded with antibodies recognizing PrPc (see Fig. 1, A, Bar-224 and B, Pri-308). Epitope Mapping—Dodecapeptides (frameshift by one residue) were synthesized on a cellulose membrane (Abimed, Langelfed, Germany) by the Spot method of multiple peptide synthesis (6Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar) as modified by Molina et al. (7Molina F. Laune D. Gougat C. Pau B. Granier C. Pept. Res. 1996; 9: 151-155PubMed Google Scholar). This method has an advantage over an ELISA method in that all peptides are presented in the same orientation (peptides are bound to the membrane by their C-terminal residue). The reactivity of immobilized peptides was assessed by incubation with the mAbs, for 90 min at 37 °C. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary antibody (1 h at room temperature). Coupling to Magnetic Beads and Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Antibodies (0.5 mg) were coupled to 1 ml of Dynabeads M-280 tosylated (from Dynal), and the surface of the beads was saturated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The final concentration of beads was 109 beads/ml. Brain tissues were homogenized (20% w/v) in 5% glucose using a ribolyzer and were first diluted 2-fold (10% homogenate) in 2× lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and finally were brought to 5% brain homogenate by diluting in the same lysis buffer. 5 μl of this 5% homogenate were incubated with or without 0.6 μg of proteinase K (PK) for 45 min at 37 °C. Samples were then diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer supplemented with 5 mm Pefabloc (Roche) to block PK digestion. 20 μl of beads coupled to antibodies were then added and reacted for 2 h at 20 °C with rotation. Beads were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20 and heated to 100 °C in loading buffer without reducing agents. When PrPsc bound to the beads was measured using an ELISA technique (see Fig. 2), we proceeded as described above, but beads coupled to antibody or BSA were reacted with the sample overnight at 4 °C. After a washing step, PrPsc was removed from the beads by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in 25 μl of denaturing buffer C1 (from the Bio-Rad purification kit) and was diluted 10-fold in EIA buffer prior to being assayed by the two-site immunometric assay. Two-site Immunometric Assay—The immunometric assay was performed in 96-well maxisorb immunoplates coated with the purified monoclonal anti-PrP antibody (SAF-34). 100 μl of sample were dispensed onto the wells and reacted for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes, 100 μl of acetylcholinesterase-labeled anti-PrP tracer, Bar-224 for sheep samples, and Pri-308 for human samples, were dispensed and reacted for 2 h at room temperature. After six washes, solid-phase bound acetylcholinesterase activity was determined using the colorimetric method of Ellman (8Grassi J. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Fretier P. Turbica I. Rezaei H. Hunsmann G. Comoy E. Deslys J.P. Arch. Virol. 2000; 16: 197-205Google Scholar). Preparation of SAFs Using the Bio-Rad Kit—SAFs were prepared using the Bio-Rad purification kit (Bio-Rad) designed to purify and concentrate PrPsc extracted from tissues. Briefly, 200 μl of 20% brain homogenate in sucrose 5% (w/v) were mixed with 200 μl of solution A containing proteinase K (80 μg/ml) and were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 200 μl of solution B and centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g, PrPsc recovered as a pellet was denatured with 25 μl of solution C1 at 100 °C for 5 min and was diluted 10-fold in EIA buffer before being assayed with the two-site immunometric assay. Competition Experiments—Beads coupled to JEQ-254 and beads coupled to SHA-31 were prereacted for 1 h at room temperature with either the hapten JEQ2 (0-[4-(2-amino-ethyl)-2-hydroxyl-phenyl]-methyl-phenyl-phosphonate) or a synthetic peptide (Pri-4) corresponding to the 126–164 sequence of human PrP, respectively, both at a concentration of 100 μg/ml before contact with brain samples. Western Blot—Samples eluted from beads were run on SDS-PAGE (12% resolving). Proteins were blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk. Immunoprecipitated PrP was detected with Pri-308 coupled to horseradish peroxidase for the human brain samples and with Bar-224 coupled to horseradish peroxidase for the sheep brain samples. Peroxidase activity was detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Dura, Pierce). Denaturation Experiments—100 μl of 10% homogenate (see above) were mixed with 100 μl of 3 m guanidine HCl in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.4 or 3.5, and incubated for 5 h at 20 °C with rotation. Proteins were then methanol-precipitated (–20 °C for 2 h). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer. Before the addition of beads, the samples were brought to a 0.2% homogenate by dilution with lysis buffer. For urea denaturation at 100 °C, 50 μl of 10% homogenate were mixed with 50 μlof8 m urea and heated to 100 °C for 10 min. Before the addition of beads, samples were brought to a 0.2% homogenate by dilution with lysis buffer (final concentration 160 mm urea). The Solid-phase Immobilized Epitope Immunoassay (SPIE-IA) Technique—The SPIE-IA technique was developed several years ago by some of us (9Pradelles P. Grassi J. Creminon C. Boutten B. Mamas S. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 16-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Volland H. Pradelles P. Ronco P. Azizi M. Simon D. Creminon C. Grassi J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 228: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This new format was originally developed to allow the determination of low molecular weight haptens in excess reagent conditions (immunometric assays) but is also suitable for measuring proteins in a sandwich format using a single epitope (11Grassi J. Creminon C. Frobert Y. Etienne E. Ezan E. Volland H. Pradelles P. Clin. Chem. 1996; 42: 1532-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here we used SPIE-IA to capture native SAF preparations with a solid-phase immobilized mAb, with the detection of captured SAFs being ensured in further steps after cross-linking of the SAF proteins, denaturation of SAF, and the detection of denatured PrP with an enzyme-labeled anti-PrP monoclonal antibody. Briefly, monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma culture supernatants were immobilized on a solid phase (96-well microtiter plate) coated with a goat polyclonal anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody (overnight at 4 °C). After a first washing step, infected brain homogenate (treated with or without PK) was reacted with solid-phase-bound mAbs (2 h at room temperature). After a second washing step, solid-phase-bound SAFs were cross-linked with a monoclonal antibody using glutaraldehyde (0.1%, for 5 min at room temperature) before a third washing step. Residual glutaraldehyde reactivity was neutralized with borate trimethylamine as described previously (10Volland H. Pradelles P. Ronco P. Azizi M. Simon D. Creminon C. Grassi J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 228: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and solid-phase-bound proteins were denatured by 1 m NaOH (5 min at room temperature). After a fifth washing step, solid-phase-bound PrP was detected by reaction with an acetylcholinesterase-labeled anti-PrP mAb. Screening of Monoclonal Antibodies for Their Capacity to Immunoprecipitate PrPsc—For this study, we tested 53 different mAbs of various specificities and from two immunoglobulin classes (20 IgM and 33 IgG). Twenty six of them were unable to immunoprecipitate significantly PrPc or PrPsc in preliminary experiments. We shall present here the results obtained with 27 different mAbs, which were categorized in four groups (Table I). mAbs of group A (all IgG) were raised against recombinant PrP or SAFs and all bind a PrP epitope containing the YY (R or Q) motif. Amazingly, one of these mAbs (Bar-234) actually binds an epitope containing the three YY (R or Q or D) motifs as described for mAb 15B3 (1Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). mAbs of group B (3 IgG and 1 IgM) were raised against PrP peptides or recombinant PrP and bind other PrP epitopes than the YY (R or Q) motif. mAbs of groups A and B were clearly shown to bind PrPc, recombinant PrP, or denatured PrPsc in previous techniques (ELISA, Western blot, immunohistochemistry). In contrast, mAbs of group C (1 IgG and 4 IgM), which were raised against the β-folded mouse recombinant PrP or native hamster SAF, were identified using a peculiar screening technique (SPIE-IA, see “Experimental Procedures”) designed to detect interactions with SAFs. However, mAbs of group C failed to bind PrPc or recombinant PrP in ELISA and Western blot experiments (Table I, legend), so that if they bind SAFs it is not established that they recognize any form of PrP. Finally, mAbs of group D (5 IgG and 6 IgM) recognizing different proteins or peptides unrelated to PrP, or unrelated haptens (see Table II).Table IMonoclonal antibodies directed against PrP or SAFsGroupMonoclonal antibodyIsotypeImmunogenLinear epitopeASAF-53IgG2aProteinase K-treated and denatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brain144-DYEDRYYREN-153ASAF-61IgG2aProteinase K-treated and denatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brain144-DYEDRYYREN-153A12F10IgG2aRecombinant human PrP144-DYEDRYYRE-152ABar-224IgG2aRecombinant ovine PrP141-FGNDYEDRYYR-151ABar-233IgG2bRecombinant ovine PrP141-FGNDYEDRYYRE-152ABar-234IgG1Recombinant ovine PrP141-FGNDYEDRYYR-151 156-RYPNQVYYRPV-166 224-RESQAYYQR-228ASHA-31IgG1Proteinase K-treated and undenatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brain145-YEDRYYRE-152BPri-308IgG1Synthetic peptide, human PrP: Pri3 (KTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLG)111-HMAGAAAA-118BPri-917IgG1Synthetic peptide, human PrP: Pri9 (CITQYERESQAYYQRGS)216-TQYERE-221B11C6IgG2aRecombinant human PrPBind PrPc through a conformational epitopeBBar-232IgMRecombinant ovine PrPUnidentifiedCSHA-29IgG1Proteinase K-treated and undenatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brainUnidentifiedCβS-43IgMRecombinant β-folded murine PrPUnidentifiedCβS-36IgMRecombinant β-folded murine PrPUnidentifiedCSHA-52IgMProteinase K-treated and undenatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brainUnidentifiedCSHA-9IgMProteinase K-treated and undenatured SAF from scrapie-infected hamster brainUnidentified Open table in a new tab Table IIMonoclonal antibodies of specificity unrelated to PrP or SAFsGroupMonoclonal antibodyIsotypeImmunogenDJEQ-254IgMJEQ2 (0-[4-(2-amino-ethyl)-2-hydroxyl-phenyl]-methyl-phenyl-phosphonate)-KLHDJEQ-255IgG1JEQ2 (0-[4-(2-amino-ethyl)-2-hydroxyl-phenyl]-methyl-phenyl-phosphonate)-KLHDHis-2IgMPolyhistidine, His11-KLHDHis-22IgG1Polyhistidine, His11-KLHDElec-39IgMAcetylcholinesterase from Electrophorus electricusDNSP-48IgMN-terminal part of substance P, RPKPQQGGC-KLHDAMT-TP 95IgM3′-aminothymidine triphosphate, AMT-TP-KLHDSDKP-21IgMN-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro, SDKPDC-KLHDTB-14AIgG1C-terminal fragment of the neurotoxic chain of the botulinic toxinDTB-15CIgG1C-terminal fragment of the neurotoxic chain of the botulinic toxinDTB-17BIgG2aC-terminal fragment of the neurotoxic chain of the botulinic toxin Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted using mAbs coupled to magnetic beads and were performed on TSE-infected and non-infected brain homogenates from sheep (Fig. 1A, scrapie (SC)) or human (Fig. 1B, CJD) in the presence or absence of proteinase K treatment. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot. The results of these immunoprecipitation experiments are presented in Fig. 1. As expected, antibodies that were shown previously to bind PrPc or recombinant PrP (groups A and B, all of IgG isotype, excepting Bar-232) clearly immunoprecipitated PrPc in non-infected brain homogenates and gave negative results in the PK-treated non-infected brain (Fig. 1). Obviously, the results are influenced by species specificity, and, for instance, Bar-224, which does not recognize human PrP, gave negative results with human brain. The reverse situation is observed with Pri-308, which binds human PrP. Among these first series (groups A and B) six antibodies (SAF-53, SAF-61, 12F10, Bar-234, SHA-31, and 11C6) were able to immunoprecipitate PrPsc in either human or sheep infected brain homogenate treated with PK, five of which (all of them excepting 11C6) bind an epitope containing the YYR motif. Among antibodies of group C none proved to immunoprecipitate PrPc as seen in non-infected brain homogenates (Fig. 1). However, all of them were able to immunoprecipitate PrPsc in either PK-treated or untreated infected brain homogenates (Fig. 1) in agreement with the results obtained by screening with the SPIE-IA technique (Table 1, legend). As expected, none of the antibodies of group D proved to immunoprecipitate PrPc, but surprisingly, six of them, including four IgM (JEQ-254, His-2, EE-39, SDKP-21) and two IgG (His-22, JEQ-255), very clearly immunoprecipitated PrPsc in the infected brain in the absence of or after PK treatment (Fig. 1). PrPsc aggregates in a scrapie-infected brain appeared more reactive than those in a CJD-infected brain (Fig. 1, compare A with B). We also made the observation that a low but significant immunoprecipitation of PrP is observed in a scrapie-infected sheep brain homogenate, in the absence of PK treatment, with BSA-coated beads (Fig. 1A). This suggests that microbeads coated with any kind of protein can bind SAFs under appropriate conditions. This is supported by the observation that increasing the concentration of PrPsc in the sample led to an increased immunoprecipitation of PrPsc by BSA-coated beads as shown in Fig. 2 where immunoprecipitated PrP is measured using an ELISA method. The results recorded with five antibodies of unrelated specificity (TB-14A, TB-15C, TB-17C, NSP-48, and AMT-95) that behave like BSA-coated beads (Fig. 1A) may just reflect the presence of BSA on the beads as a saturating agent. PrPsc in CJD-infected brain homogenate also reacts with BSA-coated beads as shown in Fig. 2, but this is not visible in the Western blot experiments presented in Fig. 1B because experimental conditions (concentration of PrPsc, reaction time) are different. Characterization of the Interactions between PrPsc and Monoclonal Antibodies—Because these data unambiguously demonstrated that antibodies bearing specificity completely unrelated to PrP (including two antibodies recognizing an artificial haptenic molecule, JEQ2, see Table II) could react with PrPsc aggregates (SAFs), we performed competition experiments to assess whether or not this binding was mediated by the binding site of the corresponding antibody. For antibodies recognizing PrPc, a clear inhibition of PrPc immunoprecipitation was observed in the presence of an excess of the corresponding PrP peptide as shown, for instance, in Fig. 3A for antibody SHA-31. With this antibody a partial inhibition of PrPsc immunoprecipitation was also observed (Fig. 3A), indicating that the anti-PrP activity of SHA-31 participates in the immunoprecipitation process. On the other hand, no inhibition was recorded with any of the other antibodies of unrelated specificity immunoprecipitating PrPsc (His-22, JEQ-255, JEQ-254, His-2, EE-39, and SDKP-21) as illustrated, for instance, by mAb JEQ-254 in Fig. 3B. This shows that the immunoprecipitation process recorded with these unrelated antibodies does not involve the antibody binding site (paratope) but rather other parts of the antibody molecule. To evaluate the implication of the Fc portion of antibodies we performed the same immunoprecipitation experiments with SHA-31 and His-22 Fab′ antibody fragments. As shown in Fig. 4, SHA-31 and His-22 Fab′ fragments failed to immunoprecipitate PrPsc, whereas SHA-31 Fab′ still efficiently binds PrPc confirming that the antibody binding site is not essentially involve in the immunoprecipitation process of PrPsc.Fig. 4Selective immunoprecipitation of PrPsc is observed with entire antibodies but not with Fab′ fragments. Immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with SHA-31 and His-22 on non-infected or CJD-infected human brain homogenates, as described in the legend to Fig. 1, using either entire antibody (A) or Fab′ fragments (B) covalently bound on magnetic microbeads. N, normal; CJD, CJD-infected; +, treated with proteinase K; –, treated without proteinase K. Similar results were obtained with sheep brain homogenates from non-infected or scrapie-infected animals (results not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Efficient Immunoprecipitation of PrPsc by Monoclonal Antibodies of Unrelated Specificity—Whatever the nature of the interactions between antibody-coated beads and SAFs, this may result in a very efficient immunoprecipitation of SAFs as shown in Fig. 2 where the results obtained with mAbs βS-36, JEQ-254, and BSA-coated beads are compared with those recorded using a rapid biochemical technique suitable for purifying SAFs (including a PK treatment and a centrifugation step, Bio-Rad purification kit). It is worth noting that βS-36-coated beads appear particularly efficient and immunoprecipitate the totality of PrPsc as efficiently as the biochemical method. This indicates that this antibody could be used advantageously for establishing an immunoprecipitation diagnostic test in absence of PK treatment. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that SAF can be immunoprecipitated through nonspecific interactions with mAbs independently of the antibody specificity. The exact nature of these interactions has yet to be investigated but very likely involves nonspecific interactions mediated either by the constant part of the antibodies or by their sugar moiety. This is supported by experiments showing that Fab′ fragments of some of these antibodies failed to immunoprecipitate PrPsc. This is not surprising taking into account that several proteins and polymers have already been shown to bind SAFs, including serum proteins (12Fischer M.B. Roeckl C. Parizek P. Schwarz H.P. Aguzzi A. Nature. 2000; 408: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), heparan sulfates (13Schonberger O. Horonchik L. Gabizon R. Papy-Garcia D. Barritault D. Taraboulos A. Biochem.

In addition, we show that a significant PrPsc immunoprecipitation can be obtained even with BSA-coated beads in appropriate conditions. The immunoprecipitation technique used is supposed to favor low affinity interactions, because antibodies or BSA is linked to a highly disperse solid phase (magnetic beads) providing a high density interaction surface thus favoring the binding with highly polymerized PrPsc as found in SAFs. Our data show that both IgG and IgM antibodies of unrelated specificity can ensure efficient immunoprecipitation of SAFs, but the proportion of IgM bearing this property seems to be higher. In addition, anti-PrP mAbs can participate in the immunoprecipitation of SAFs through their paratope as observed here with mAbs SHA-31 (but also with SAF-53, SAF-61, 12F10, and 11C6, results not shown) indicating that SAFs bear PrPc molecules or PrPc epitopes in agreement with previous works (16Bieschke J. Giese A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Zerr I. Poser S. Eigen M. Kretzschmar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5468-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, our work raises serious questions concerning the actual specificity of the antibodies described previously as specifically recognizing PrPsc, because the hypothesis of nonspecific interaction between monoclonal antibodies and SAFs was not taken into account. In the studies by Korth et al. (1Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and Curin et al. (3Curin S.V. Bresjanac M. Popovic M. Pretnar H.K. Galvani V. Rupreht R. Cernilec M. Vranac T. Hafner I. Jerala R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3694-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) it is quite clear that mAbs 15B3 and V5B2 have some anti-PrP activity, because they both bind linear PrP peptides. mAb-mediated immunoprecipitation of SAFs could thus be related to low affinity anti-PrP binding enhanced by the use of microbeads, which favor the reactivity of PrPsc (largely aggregated as SAFs and presenting repeated PrP epitopes) with regard to PrPc (monomeric or oligomeric). The presence of PrPc epitopes on SAFs is supported by some observations made in our study wherein a large proportion of anti-PrP mAbs actually immunoprecipitated PrPsc, as found in PK-treated SAF preparations (Fig. 1). In this situation, the specificity of immunoprecipitation is linked to the technique used (immunoprecipitation) rather than to the intrinsic specificity of the mAbs. Alternatively, selective immunoprecipitation of PrPsc could result from nonspecific interactions as observed here with some antibodies of unrelated specificity. This question remains open and can be cleared up only by means of appropriate competitive experiments. In contrast, the rationale proposed by Paramithiotis et al. (2Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K. Tonelli Q. Ledebur H.C. Chakrabartty A. Cashman N.R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) appears highly questionable for the following reasons. 1)This paper provides very little evidence that anti-YYR antibodies actually bind any form of PrP. There are no data demonstrating that these antibodies specifically bind β-folded recombinant PrP with regards to α-folded PrP, which is the basis of the rationale described by the authors. In addition, it is not shown that the immunizing peptide (CYYRRYYRYY) can inhibit the immunoprecipitation of SAFs. The only data supporting PrP binding are those showing that these antibodies bind “partially denatured PrP” as obtained in acidic pH and guanidine HCl-treated non-infected brain samples. To our mind, the observed binding is due rather to the aggregation of PrPc favored by this specific treatment, as shown by the same authors in a previous paper (17Zou W.Q. Cashman N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43942-43947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This is supported by the demonstration that mAbs βS-36 and JEQ-254, which have no anti-PrP activity, were able to immunoprecipitate PrPc, as contained in a non-infected brain sample when this partial denaturing treatment was applied (Fig. 5). This confirms that immunoprecipitation is related to the aggregation of PrP and not because of an epitope specifically exposed in PrPsc or partially denatured PrPc.2)In our study, we tested seven monoclonal antibodies directed against a linear epitope containing the YY (R or Q) motif (mAbs of group A), and most of them bind PrPc as observed in tests performed on a non-infected brain in the absence of PK treatment. It is worth noting that mAb 6H4 used as a control antibody (binding both PrPc and SAFs) by the same authors also binds an epitope containing the YYR sequence (1Korth C. Stierli B. Streit P. Moser M. Schaller O. Fischer R. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Kretzschmar H. Raeber A. Braun U. Ehrensperger F. Hornemann S. Glockshuber R. Riek R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. Oesch B. Nature. 1997; 390: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). This shows that the YY (R or Q) epitope is not cryptic in PrPc, which is in contradiction with the hypothesis of Paramithiotis et al. (2Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K. Tonelli Q. Ledebur H.C. Chakrabartty A. Cashman N.R. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Our feeling is that the results reported in Paramithiotis et al. (2Paramithiotis E. Pinard M. Lawton T. LaBoissiere S. Leathers V.L. Zou W.Q. Estey L.A. Lamontagne J. Lehto M.T. Kondejewski L.H. Francoeur G.P. Papadopoulos M. Haghighat A. Spatz S.J. Head M. Will R. Ironside J. O'Rourke K.

Med. 2003; 9: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) reflect mainly nonspecific interactions between mAbs and SAFs, as those observed here with PrP-unrelated mAbs. The reasons that this is observed with all anti-YYR monoclonal antibodies described in this paper and not with BSA-coated beads and several control antibodies are not clear and possibly reflect differences under “Experimental Procedures” as well as a serendipitous selection of control antibodies. Whatever way the antibodies were produced, it appears that a large proportion of mouse monoclonal antibodies bearing a specificity completely unrelated to SAFs or PrP allows selective immunoprecipitation of aggregated PrPsc as found in SAFs from a TSE-infected brain. In this context, the only requirement to obtain selective immunoprecipitation of PrPsc versus PrPc is to use antibodies not recognizing PrPc. As a consequence, such antibodies could be selected efficiently by screening large libraries of mAbs of unrelated specificity in immunoprecipitation experiments rather than resorting to more sophisticated approaches. This is very likely what we did when we screened mAbs of the βS or of the SHA series using the SPIE-IA technique (Table I, legend). Obviously antibodies bearing this property are suitable for developing a diagnostic test for TSE allowing direct detection of PrPsc as shown in Fig. 2. The actual advantages of this approach would be to allow a rapid and efficient concentration of PrPsc in the absence of PK treatment and the centrifugation step. This point is under examination in our laboratory. We thank Hans A. Kretzschmar and Dr. Perret-Liaudet for providing human brain samples, to Dr. Olivier Andréoletti for providing sheep brain samples, and to G. Hunsmann for the provision of mAbs 12F10 and 11C6.

https://openalex.org/W1990580956,"In Escherichia coli, two main protein targeting pathways to the inner membrane exist: the SecB pathway for the essentially posttranslational targeting of secretory proteins and the SRP pathway for cotranslational targeting of inner membrane proteins (IMPs). At the inner membrane both pathways converge at the Sec translocase, which is capable of both linear transport into the periplasm and lateral transport into the lipid bilayer. The Sec-associated YidC appears to assist the lateral transport of IMPs from the Sec translocase into the lipid bilayer. It should be noted that targeting and translocation of only a handful of secretory proteins and IMPs have been studied. These model proteins do not include lipoproteins. Here, we have studied the targeting and translocation of two secretory lipoproteins, the murein lipoprotein and the bacteriocin release protein, using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach. The data indicate that both murein lipoprotein and bacteriocin release protein require the SRP pathway for efficient targeting to the Sec translocase.

Furthermore, we show that YidC plays an important role in the targeting/translocation of both lipoproteins. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the SecB pathway targets a subset of secretory proteins to the Sec translocase (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Google Scholar). The chaperone SecB keeps secretory proteins in a translocation-competent state. The SecB-preprotein complex is targeted at a late stage during translation or after translation to the Sec translocase in the inner membrane. The signal recognition particle (SRP) 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; IMP, inner membrane protein; IMV, inverted membrane vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; LP, mature lipoprotein; OmpA, outer membrane protein A; TF, trigger factor; TM, transmembrane segment; (Tmd)Phe, l-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-diazirin-3H-yl]phenylalanine; U-PLP, unmodified prolipoprotein; HA, hemagglutinin; BRP, bacteriocin release protein; Lpp, murein lipoprotein; SPase, signal peptidase. 1The abbreviations used are: SRP, signal recognition particle; IMP, inner membrane protein; IMV, inverted membrane vesicle; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; LP, mature lipoprotein; OmpA, outer membrane protein A; TF, trigger factor; TM, transmembrane segment; (Tmd)Phe, l-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-diazirin-3H-yl]phenylalanine; U-PLP, unmodified prolipoprotein; HA, hemagglutinin; BRP, bacteriocin release protein; Lpp, murein lipoprotein; SPase, signal peptidase. pathway targets IMPs to the same or a very similar Sec translocase in a cotranslational mechanism (2Herskovits A.A. Bochkareva E.S. Bibi E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 927-939Google Scholar, 3de Gier J.W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Google Scholar). The SRP, which consists of the Ffh protein and the 4.5 S RNA, binds to the first transmembrane segment (TM) of an IMP when it becomes exposed outside the ribosome. Upon contact of the SRP with its receptor, FtsY, the nascent IMP dissociates from the SRP and enters the Sec translocase. The core of the Sec translocase consists of the IMPs, SecY and SecE, and the peripheral subunit, SecA (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Google Scholar). SecY and SecE form a protein-conducting channel (4Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Google Scholar), and SecA drives proteins in an ATP-dependent process through this channel (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Google Scholar). The Sec translocase catalyzes linear transport of secretory proteins and of periplasmic domains of IMPs across the membrane. In addition, TMs of IMPs are recognized in the Sec translocase and laterally transferred into the lipid bilayer. The Sec translocase-associated form of YidC appears to assist in this lateral transfer of TMs (5Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Google Scholar, 6Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Google Scholar). YidC, which is present in excess over the Sec translocase, is also involved in the integration of some small SRP/Sec-independent IMPs (7Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 8Serek J. Bauer-Manz G. Struhalla G. Van Den Berg L. Kiefer D. Dalbey R. Kuhn A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 294-301Google Scholar). Thus far, no evidence has been obtained that points to a role of YidC in the targeting/translocation of secretory proteins across the inner membrane (7Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 9Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Bernstein H.D. Oudega B. Otto B.R. Luirink J. J. Biol.

It should be noted that in E. coli targeting and translocation of only a handful of secretory proteins and IMPs have been studied thoroughly. Hardly anything is known about the targeting and translocation of lipoproteins, which in most cases are secretory proteins. A lipoprotein is synthesized as a preprotein with an N-terminal signal sequence. Lipoproteins contain a conserved sequence, the “lipobox,” that includes the signal peptidase II (SPase II) cleavage site (10Juncker A.S. Willenbrock H. Von Heijne G. Brunak S. Nielsen H. Krogh A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1652-1662Google Scholar). The cysteine located just after the SPaseII cleavage site is diacylglycerated upon translocation; subsequently the signal sequence is clipped off by SPaseII, yielding an apolipoprotein. Finally, the amino-modified cysteine is fatty acylated, giving rise to the mature lipoprotein (11Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Google Scholar). Secretory lipoproteins can, depending on the sequence of the early mature region, remain associated to the outer leaflet of the inner membrane or be transported by the Lol system to the outer membrane (12Hara T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40408-40414Google Scholar). To identify the components involved in the targeting and translocation of secretory lipoproteins, we have analyzed the maturation of two model secretory lipoproteins. Maturation of lipoproteins has been studied in vivo using strains that are mutated in targeting and translocation factors and in vitro using a translation/cross-linking system. One of the two model lipoproteins is the murein lipoprotein (Lpp), which is the most abundant protein in E. coli. Lpp is attached to the inner leaflet of the outer membrane of E. coli and forms stable trimers (13Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar). One of three Lpp molecules is covalently linked to the peptidoglycan layer (13Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar). The other model lipoprotein is the pCloCF13-encoded bacteriocin release protein (BRP) (14van der Wal F.J. Luirink J. Oudega B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 381-399Google Scholar). The BRP is essential for the translocation of the bacteriocin cloacin DF13, a bactericidal protein, across the cell envelope (14van der Wal F.J. Luirink J. Oudega B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 381-399Google Scholar). Notably, the BRP signal sequence is very stable after cleavage from the preprotein, in contrast to other signal sequences, and plays a yet undefined role in cloacin DF13 export (14van der Wal F.J. Luirink J. Oudega B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 381-399Google Scholar). Our combined in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that the SRP pathway plays an important role in the targeting of Lpp and BRP to the Sec translocase. Surprisingly, YidC is also shown to function in the targeting/translocation of both secretory lipoproteins. Reagents, Enzymes, and Sera—All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and alkaline phosphatase were purchased from Invitrogen. The Expand long template PCR kit was from Roche Applied Science. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene, and the Megashort script T7 transcription kit was from Ambion Inc. [35S]methionine and protein A-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Pansorbin was obtained from Merck. All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma. Antiserum against hemagglutinin (HA) tag was purchased from Sigma and AbCam. Antisera against L23 and L29 were kind gifts from R. Brimacombe. The antisera against TF and SecA were gifts from W. Wickner. Antisera against Ffh, YidC, and SecY were from our own collection. E. coli Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions for in Vivo Targeting and Translocation Studies—E. coli strain TOP10F′ grown in Luria Bertani medium was used for all plasmid constructions. In all lipoprotein expression vectors, the pCloDF13-encoded T1 terminator, which regulates the expression of the pCloDF13-encoded BRP, was cloned upstream of the genes encoding Lpp and BRP to prevent any background expression (15van den Elzen P.J. Walters H.H. Veltkamp E. Nijkamp H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2465-2477Google Scholar). Upon induction of expression, the T1 terminator is “overruled.” The pCloDF13-encoded T1 terminator region was amplified using pJL28 as a template (16Luirink J. Duim B. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 393-399Google Scholar). Primers were designed so that both an NcoI site and a stop codon were introduced upstream and an EcoRI site and a ribosome binding site were introduced downstream of the T1 terminator region. The T1 terminator region was cloned NcoI-EcoRI into pET21d, yielding pET21d-T1. Plasmids pET21d-T1Lpp and pET21d-T1BRP were obtained by plasmid PCR and site-directed mutagenesis using pGEM42-Lpp and pJL28, respectively, as templates (17Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Google Scholar). A methionine codon was introduced at position 16 in the Lpp signal sequence and position 17 in the BRP signal sequence (Fig. 1). In addition, a C-terminal 4 × methionine tag was attached to both Lpp and BRP to increase labeling efficiency. Subsequently, T1Lpp and T1BRP were NcoI-HindIII-cloned into pEH1 (18Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Mehraein-Ghomi F. Mitsopoulos C. Jacob J.P. Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 676-678Google Scholar), pEH3 (18Hashemzadeh-Bonehi L. Mehraein-Ghomi F. Mitsopoulos C. Jacob J.P. Hennessey E.S. Broome-Smith J.K. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 676-678Google Scholar), and pBAD24 (19Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8168-8172Google Scholar), yielding pEH1-T1Lpp, pEH3-T1Lpp, pBAD24-T1Lpp, pEH1-T1BRP, pEH3-T1BRP, and pBAD24-T1BRP. Finally, the genetic information coding for an HA tag with a stop codon at its 3′ prime end (20Chen Y.T. Holcomb C. Moore H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6508-6512Google Scholar), preceded by a flexible linker (Pro-Gly-Gly) was fused to the 4 × methionine-tagged Lpp and BRP, using BamHI and HindIII sites. This yielded pEH1-T1LppHA, pEH3-T1LppHA, pBAD24-T1LppHA, pEH1-T1BRPHA, pEH3-T1BRPHA, and pBAD24-T1BRPHA. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The Ffh conditional strain WAM121 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% arabinose as described previously (21de Gier J.W. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Google Scholar). To deplete cells for Ffh, cells were grown to mid-log phase in the absence of arabinose. The 4.5 S RNA conditional strain FF283 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 mm IPTG as described previously (21de Gier J.W. Mansournia P. Valent Q.A. Phillips G.J. Luirink J. von Heijne G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 307-309Google Scholar). To deplete cells for 4.5 S RNA, cells were grown to mid-log phase in the absence of IPTG. The temperature-sensitive amber suppressor SecA depletion strain BA13 and the control strain DO251 were cultured in M9 minimal medium at 30 °C as described previously (22Qi H.Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Google Scholar, 23Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Park S.K. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1015-1027Google Scholar). To deplete cells for SecA, cells were grown to mid-log phase at 41 °C. The SecE depletion strain CM124 was cultured in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% glucose and 0.2% l-arabinose as described previously (24Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Google Scholar, 25de Gier J.W. Scotti P.A. Sääf A. Valent Q.A. Kuhn A. Luirink J. von Heijne G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Google Scholar). To deplete cells for SecE, cells were grown to mid-log phase in the absence of l-arabinose. The temperature-sensitive amber suppressor YidC depletion strain KO1672, along with its wild-type control strain KO1670 (26Hansen F.G. Hansen E.B. Atlung T. Gene. 1985; 38: 85-93Google Scholar), were cultured in M9 minimal medium at 30 °C overnight. To deplete KO1672 cells for YidC, cells were grown to mid-log phase at 42 °C. Where appropriate, ampicillin (100 μg ml–1), chloramphenicol (30 μg ml–1), kanamycin (50 μg ml–1), and tetracyclin (12.5 μg ml–1) were added to the medium. In Vivo Assay for Targeting and Translocation—The model lipoproteins Lpp and BRP were expressed by l-arabinose induction from the pBAD24 vector in strains TOP10F′, FF283, BA13, DO251, KO1672, and KO1670 and by IPTG induction from the pEH1 vector in strain CM124 and the pEH3 vector in strain WAM121. For all experiments cells were grown to mid-log phase. Expression of the constructs was induced for 3 min with either l-arabinose (0.2%) or IPTG (1 mm). When indicated, the SPaseII inhibitor globomycin (final concentration 100 μg ml–1) was added 5 min before induction. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml, Ci = 37 GBq) for 30 s before precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (final concentration 10%). Subsequently, the samples were washed with acetone, resuspended in 10 mm Tris/2% SDS, and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and anti-OmpA serum. Anti-HA immunoprecipitations were analyzed by means of Tricine SDS-PAGE (16.5% peptide criterion gels from Bio-Rad) and anti-OmpA immunoprecipitations by means of standard SDS-PAGE. Gels were scanned by Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimaging using the Image Reader V1.8J/Image Gauge V 3.45 software. E. coli Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions for in Vitro Studies—E. coli strain MC1061 grown in Luria Bertani medium supplemented with CaCl2 (10 mm) was used for all plasmid constructions. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used for the construction of all point mutations. Strain MRE600 was used to prepare a lysate for translation of in vitro synthesized mRNA and suppression of UAG stop codons in the presence of (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup. Inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs) were prepared from strain MC4100 grown in Luria Bertani medium. Plasmid pC4Meth55LppTAG11 (Fig. 1) was constructed by plasmid PCR and site-directed mutagenesis using pGEM42-Lpp as template (17Valent Q.A. Kendall D.A. High S. Kusters R. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5494-5505Google Scholar). Plasmid pC4Meth55BRPTAG10 was obtained by plasmid PCR and site-directed mutagenesis using pJL28 as a template (16Luirink J. Duim B. de Gier J.W. Oudega B. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 393-399Google Scholar). pC4Meth55LppTAG11 encodes truncated Lpp, and pC4Meth-55BRPTAG10 encodes truncated BRP. A methionine has been introduced at position 16 in the Lpp signal sequence and at position 17 in the BRP signal sequence, and both Lpp and BRP have been fused to a C-terminal 4 × methionine tag to improve labeling efficiency. Plasmid pC4Meth55LppTAG11 contains an amber mutation at position 11 in the Lpp gene, and plasmid pC4Meth55BRPTAG10 contains an amber mutation (TAG) at position 10 in the BRP gene to enable tRNAsup photocross-linking (Fig. 1). Where appropriate, ampicillin (100 μgml–1) was added to the medium. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, Targeting, and Cross-linking— Truncated mRNA was prepared as described previously from HindIII-linearized Lpp and BRP derivative plasmids. For photocross-linking, (Tmd)Phe was site-specifically incorporated into nascent chains by suppression of a UAG stop codon using (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup in an E. coli in vitro translation system containing [35S]methionine to label the nascent chains. This procedure has been described previously (5Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Google Scholar, 27Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Google Scholar). Targeting to IMVs, photocross-linking, and carbonate extraction (to separate soluble and peripheral membrane proteins from integral membrane proteins) was carried out as described previously (27Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Google Scholar). Carbonate-soluble and -insoluble fractions were either trichloroacetic acid precipitated or immunoprecipitated. The material used for immunoprecipitation was 2-fold the amount used for trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Release of nascent chains from the ribosome was provoked by incubating the nascent chains after translation for 10 min at 37 °C with EDTA (25 mm). Samples were analyzed using 15% Laemmli SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging as described previously (27Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Google Scholar). Model Lipoproteins—We have used the murein Lpp and the pCloDF13-encoded BRP as model proteins to study the targeting and translocation of secretory lipoproteins in E. coli (13Shu W. Liu J. Ji H. Lu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1101-1112Google Scholar, 14van der Wal F.J. Luirink J. Oudega B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 381-399Google Scholar). To improve the labeling of Lpp and BRP with [35S]methionine, both lipoproteins were slightly modified. A methionine was introduced in the signal sequences of both Lpp and BRP (Fig. 1). This does not have a significant impact on the predicted hydrophobicity of the Lpp and BRP signal sequences, and we felt confident that the introduction of a methionine would affect Lpp and BRP signal sequence interactions only marginally at the most. Actually, in the ColA and ColN BRPs, which are homologous to the pCloDF13 BRP, a methionine naturally occurs at this position. To further improve labeling, a stretch of 4 methionines was attached to the very C terminus of both Lpp and BRP. To be able to immunoprecipitate Lpp and BRP in the in vivo experiments, the 9-amino acid-long influenza virus HA epitope tag preceded by a flexible linker (Pro-Gly-Gly) was attached to their C termini (Fig. 1) (20Chen Y.T. Holcomb C. Moore H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6508-6512Google Scholar). The modified pCloDF13-encoded BRP causes lysis upon overexpression, just like the wild-type version of the protein, and the clipped off signal sequence is stable (results not shown). For the sake of clarity, we refer in the rest of this report to the modified lipoproteins as Lpp and BRP. Translocation of Lpp and BRP across the Inner Membrane Is Sec Translocase-dependent—To test whether the introduction of the extra methionines and the HA tag interfere with the in vivo processing and maturation of Lpp and BRP, the constructs were studied in the E. coli TOP10F′ strain and Sec translocase mutant strains. Maturation of lipoproteins occurs in three steps: 1) the unmodified prolipoprotein (U-PLP) is converted into a diacylated prolipoprotein (M-PLP) upon translocation across the inner membrane, 2) cleavage of the signal sequence by SPaseII yields the apolipoprotein, and 3) acylation of the lipoprotein gives rise to the mature lipoprotein (11Sankaran K. Wu H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19701-19706Google Scholar). Both Lpp and BRP were expressed in the TOP10F′ strain in the absence and presence of globomycin, which inhibits SPaseII. Inhibition of SPaseII causes the accumulation of the M-PLP form of lipoproteins (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2) (28Inukai M. Takeuchi M. Shimizu K. Arai M. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 1203-1205Google Scholar). This was confirmed in experiments where [3H]palmitate was used rather than [35S]methionine to label cells in the presence of globomycin (results not shown). Taken together, the modifications improve labeling and facilitate immunoprecipitation of Lpp and BRP without affecting their maturation. Lpp and BRP were also expressed in SecE and SecA depletion strains. Both SecE and SecA are key components of the Sec translocase. Upon depletion of SecE, SecY is rapidly degraded by the FtsH protease. Therefore, SecE depletion results in the loss of the SecY/E core of the Sec translocase (29Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Tokuda H. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31196-31201Google Scholar). SecA depletion results in the loss of the motor of the Sec translocase (22Qi H.Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Google Scholar). Upon SecE and SecA depletion, the U-PLP form of both Lpp and BRP accumulate (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6). This points to a key role of the Sec translocase in the translocation of Lpp and BRP across the inner membrane, corroborating previous studies using Sec-conditional mutant strains (30Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 949-954Google Scholar, 31Oudega B. Mol O. van Ulsen P. Stegehuis F. van der Wal F.J. Luirink J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1543-1547Google Scholar, 32Sugai M. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2511-2516Google Scholar, 33Watanabe T. Hayashi S. Wu H.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 4001-4007Google Scholar). Efficient in Vivo Targeting of Lpp and BRP Requires SRP— How are Lpp and BRP targeted to the Sec translocase? The SecB and the SRP pathways are the two main targeting pathways to the Sec translocase (34Valent Q.A. Scotti P.A. High S. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. Lentzen G. Wintermeyer W. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2504-2512Google Scholar). In the absence of SecB, targeting of both Lpp and BRP is not significantly affected (results not shown). We next investigated the role of the SRP in the targeting of Lpp and BRP to the Sec translocase. The E. coli SRP consists of the protein component Ffh and the RNA component 4.5 S RNA. Both Ffh and 4.5 S RNA are essential for viability, and depletion of either of the SRP components compromises the SRP targeting pathway, thereby preventing the targeting of many IMPs (3de Gier J.W. Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 314-322Google Scholar, 35Ribes V. Romisch K. Giner A. Dobberstein B. Tollervey D. Cell. 1990; 63: 591-600Google Scholar, 36Phillips G.J. Silhavy T.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 744-746Google Scholar). Targeting of Lpp and BRP was studied both under 4.5 S RNA and Ffh depletion conditions (Fig. 3, A and B). Depletion of 4.5 S RNA (Fig. 3A) and of Ffh (Fig. 3B) both resulted in accumulation of the unmodified precursor forms of BRP (most pronounced) and Lpp (less pronounced). As a control, the processing of pro-OmpA, an outer membrane protein that is targeted by SecB, was monitored in the same samples. No effect of depletion of the SRP components could be detected, confirming that the observed accumulation of U-PLP is not because of more general secondary effects of SRP depletion. Together, the results indicate that a functional SRP pathway is required for efficient targeting of the BRP and, albeit to a lesser extent, of the Lpp. Efficient in Vivo Translocation of Lpp and BRP Requires YidC—All IMPs studied so far require YidC for efficient assembly into the inner membrane. It has been suggested that YidC assists the transfer of TMs from the Sec translocase into the lipid bilayer (5Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Google Scholar). So far, no evidence has been obtained pointing to a role of YidC in the translocation of secretory proteins (6Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Müller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Google Scholar, 7Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E.

However, the unexpected role of the SRP in the targeting of BRP and Lpp prompted us to evaluate the role of YidC in the translocation of these proteins using a temperature-sensitive strain that is conditional for YidC expression (Fig. 4). To our surprise, depletion of YidC by growth at the non-permissive temperature resulted in the accumulation of unmodified precursor forms of BRP (most pronounced) and Lpp (less pronounced). Again, the processing of pro-OmpA that is translocated independent of YidC (7Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar) was monitored as a control and appeared unaffected. The combined data suggest that YidC plays a differential role in the translocation of both lipoproteins. Nascent Lpp and BRP Synthesized in Vitro Cross-link to Ffh, SecA, SecY, and YidC—To study the targeting and translocation of Lpp and BRP in more detail, we have used an in vitro translation/photo cross-linking approach. In this assay, the interactions of nascent (ribosome-associated) polypeptides with cytosolic and membrane components are fixed and analyzed. [35S]Methionine-radiolabeled nascent chains of Lpp and BRP were synthesized in an E. coli cell-free extract from truncated mRNA to a length of 55 amino acids. Assuming that the ribosome covers ∼35 amino acids, the Lpp and BRP signal sequences are expected to be exposed just outside the ribosome (37Houben E.N. Urbanus M.L. Van Der Laan M. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Driessen A.J. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35880-35886Google Scholar). To specifically probe the molecular environment of the signal sequence in the nascent Lpp and BRP species, a single amber stop codon (TAG) was introduced in the center of the hydrophobic core in the Lpp (position 11) and BRP (position 10) signal sequences (Fig. 1). The amber stop codons were suppressed during the in vitro translation by addition of (Tmd-)Phe-tRNAsup, an amber suppressor tRNA that is amino-acylated with the photo cross-linker (Tmd)Phe. In all constructs, the TAGs were efficiently suppressed by (Tmd)Phe-tRNAsup (data not shown). Purified inverted IMVs were added from the start of the translation reaction to allow cotranslational membrane targeting and interaction of the translation intermediates with the membrane. After the translation/insertion reaction, one half of each sample was irradiated with UV light to induce cross-linking; the other half was kept in the dark to serve as a control. The samples were extracted with carbonate to separate soluble and peripherally membrane-associated material from membrane-integrated components. Cross-linking partners were identified by immunoprecipitation. Without UV irradiation, no cross-linking products were detected using both Lpp and BRP nascent chains (data not shown). Upon translation but prior to UV irradiation, the samples were divided in two, and EDTA was added to one aliquot to provoke the release of the nascent chains from the ribosome. This allowed us to assess the importance of the context of the ribosome for cross-linking to the truncated Lpp and BRP species. EDTA has been shown to disassemble ribosomes (37Houben E.N. Urbanus M.L. Van Der Laan M. Ten Hagen-Jongman C.M. Driessen A.J. Brunner J. Oudega B. Luirink J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35880-35886Google Scholar). Both nascent Lpp and BRP were efficiently targeted to the IMVs, judging from the relatively high (∼50%) carbonate resistance. When the carbonate supernatant of UV-irradiated samples was"

One of them, PecS, which belongs to the MarR family, also controls the synthesis of various other virulence factors, such as cellulases and indigoidine. Here, the PecS consensus-binding site is defined by combining a systematic evolution of ligands by an exponential enrichment approach and mutational analyses. The consensus consists of a 23-base pair palindromic-like sequence (C–11G–10A–9N–8W–7T–6C–5G–4T–3A–2)T–1A0T1(T2A3C4G5A6N7N8N9C10G11). Mutational experiments revealed that (i) the palindromic organization is required for the binding of PecS, (ii) the very conserved part of the consensus (–6 to 6) allows for a specific interaction with PecS, but the presence of the relatively degenerated bases located apart significantly increases PecS affinity, (iii) the four bases G, A, T, and C are required for efficient binding of PecS, and (iv) the presence of several binding sites on the same promoter increases the affinity of PecS. This consensus is detected in the regions involved in PecS binding on the previously characterized target genes. This variable consensus is in agreement with the observation that the members of the MarR family are able to bind various DNA targets as dimers by means of a winged helix DNA-binding motif. Binding of PecS on a promoter region containing the defined consensus results in a repression of gene transcription in vitro. Preliminary scanning of the E. chrysanthemi genome sequence with the consensus revealed the presence of strong PecS-binding sites in the intergenic region between fliE and fliFGHIJKLMNOPQR which encode proteins involved in the biogenesis of flagellum. Accordingly, PecS directly represses fliE expression. Thus, PecS seems to control the synthesis of virulence factors required for the key steps of plant infection.

The enterobacteria Erwinia chrysanthemi and other soft-rot Erwinia species can infect a wide range of economically important crops causing soft-rot diseases. The pathogenic behavior of these bacteria is characterized by a rapid necrosis of parenchymatous tissues, mainly caused by pectic enzymes that degrade the middle lamellae and the primary cell wall (1Collmer A. Keen N. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1986; 24: 383-409Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, plant colonization by pectinolytic Erwinia is a multifactorial process requiring numerous additional factors, including cellulases (2Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Condemine G. Nasser W.

However, it seems clear that appropriate regulation of gene expression is essential for a pathogen to adapt to a particular host environment. In E. chrysanthemi, the production of pectic enzymes is modulated by a complex network involving several regulatory proteins (10Surgey N. Robert-Baudouy J. Condemine G. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1071-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Reverchon S.

Among them is the PecS protein, a member of the MarR family of transcriptional regulators that are required for the adaptation of a variety of bacteria to different environments. This family includes MarR and EmrR (Escherichia coli), which control genes involved in multiple antibiotic resistance; RovA, which plays a role in the regulation of the invasion of mammalian cells by Yersinia enterocolitica and mediates regulation of invasin in response to environmental signals; HprR (Bacillus subtilis) required for hydrogen peroxide resistance as well as for the control of sporulation; MexR, which regulates multidrug efflux systems in Pseudomonas aeruginosa; and SlyASt (Salmonella typhimurium), which is required for resistance against oxidative damage and survival in macrophages (15Miller P.F.

In E. chrysanthemi, PecS acts as a repressor on the production of the degradative enzymes, i.e. pectate lyases and cellulases (21Reverchon S. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1127-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and up-regulates the synthesis of polygalacturonase enzymes (22Nasser W. Schevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Schevchik V.E. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pecS mutants produce an extracellular blue pigment called indigoidine, which is involved in the resistance to the products of oxidative burst, including hydrogen peroxide (24Reverchon S. Rouanet C. Expert D. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Consistent with its involvement in the regulation of the synthesis of a large group of virulence factors, it has been shown that PecS plays a key role in the virulence of E. chrysanthemi (24Reverchon S. Rouanet C. Expert D. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 654-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The signal to which PecS responds is not yet known. Previous experiments carried out on 11 natural PecS target genes have suggested that PecS binds to DNA as a dimer and acts by means of a direct mechanism by interacting with the regulatory regions of the controlled genes (22Nasser W. Schevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Schevchik V.E. Nasser W. J.

For example, the operator site to which PecS binds to control gene transcription has not been identified, and it is not clear whether PecS directly modulates the RNA polymerase activity on the controlled gene promoters. The present study is aimed at more fully understanding the nature of the molecular mechanisms used by PecS to direct the gene expression control. A PCR-based systematic evolution of ligands by an exponential enrichment (SELEX) 1The abbreviations used are: SELEX, systematic evolution of ligands by an exponential enrichment; RNAP, RNA polymerase. approach and site-directed mutagenesis experiments were used to identify the PecS-binding site consensus; database searches revealed new members of the PecS regulon. Moreover, we report the use of in vitro transcription and potassium permanganate footprinting to monitor the action of PecS on RNA polymerase activity. Chemicals and Enzymes—Chemicals and enzymes used in this work were obtained from commercial sources. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Microbiological Methods—Bacterial strains used in this work were E. coli DH5α (F′ ϕ80dlacZ Δ(lacZYA-argF)U169deoR recA1 and A1 hsdR17 (rk—1, mk+) phoA supE44 λ-thi-1 gyrA96 relA1/F′ proAB+ lacIqZΔM15 Tn10-Tc) (Invitrogen) and E. chrysanthemi strain A350 (lmrTc lacZ2) and its pecS derivative, A1524 (lmrTc lacZ2 pecS::MudIIPR13) (laboratory collection). All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented, when required, with antibiotics at the following concentration: 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol. To test motility, equal quantities of bacteria were loaded into holes in 0.4% Luria-Bertani agar plates. Plates were checked between 12 and 24 h after inoculation. Motility was determined by measuring the diameter of the colony. The plasmid pCR 2.1 (Invitrogen) was used for the cloning of the SELEX products. The constructs pSR1235 and pSR1802 are described by Praillet et al. (25Praillet T. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 26Praillet T. Reverchon S. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The plasmids pN1908, pN1912, and pN1946 are described by Nasser et al. (22Nasser W. Schevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The construct pSR1919 was generated by deleting the 1675-bp NruI/SmaI from pSR1802. For construction of pWN2965, the celZ promoter region (330-bp NruI/EcoRV) from pSR1919 was cloned in the EcoRV site of pBluescriptApR (Stratagene). The plasmid pWN2969 was generated by cloning the fliE regulatory region (361 bp, —313 to +48, relative to the translation initiation codon ATG) in the vector pCR 2.1. RNA Isolation and Primer Extension Analysis—RNA extraction and normalization, as well as primer extension experiments, were essentially performed as described previously (28Reverchon S. Expert D. Robert-Baudouy J. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3500-3508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers used for specific detection of mRNA were 5′ end-labeled: celZ1, 5′-CTGGATTCTTATCCAAATAAGAGAGCGG-3′, which anneals to celZ mRNA molecules at positions +4to +31 (relative to the translation initiation codon ATG); fliEpext, 5′-CGTCGATACCCTGAATAGAC-3′, and PFliE1R, 5′-CGGTAATCTGCATCTGCTGC-3′, which anneal +3to +22 and +29 to +48, respectively (relative to the fliE translation initiation codon ATG). The extension products were resolved on a 6% sequencing gel and visualized by autoradiography on Amersham MP film. The length of the transcripts was identified by using the corresponding dideoxy sequencing reactions as a reference. Proteins—PecS was isolated as described previously (26Praillet T. Reverchon S. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The E. coli RNA polymerase holoenzyme was purchased from Epicentre (Epicentre, Madison, WI). Band-shift Assay—PpecS, PpecSL, PpecSH, and PfliE were PCR-amplified using pSR1235 or pWN2969 DNA as templates and the pairs of primers PecSBanID (5′-GTGCCAATCACCAGCATGG-3′) and PecS-BglIR (5′-GCACATCCATGTGCAGTTCTC-3′), PecSBanID and PecM-48R (5′-GACATTGAATATTTCTTTCCGG-3′), PecM-46D (5′-GATGTTATTGACATACTAATTACG-3′) and PecSBglIR, PFliE1R and PFliE2D (5′-GCTGAACGATATGGGTAACG-3′), respectively. The primers PecS-BanID, PecM-46D, PecM-48R, and PecSBglIR are complementary to +147 to +166, —64 to —41, —39 to —18, and —183 to —163, respectively (relative to the pecS transcription initiation site); the primers PfliED2 and PfliE1R are complementary to —313 to —294 and +29 to +48, respectively (relative to the fliE translation initiation codon). The primers PecSBanID, PecM-48D, and PfliED2 were uniquely end-labeled using (γ-32P)ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The fragments obtained were purified after electrophoresis on agarose gel using the Qiagen quick extraction kit. The PcelZ, PpehX, PpehV, and PpehW DNA fragments were recovered from plasmids pSR1919, pN1908, pN1912, and pN1946, respectively. These DNA fragments were further end-labeled with (α-32P)dCTP or (α-32P)dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase was then purified as described above. Band-shift assays were performed as described previously (26Praillet T. Reverchon S. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and apparent dissociation constants (Kd) were determined as described earlier (29Nasser W. Reverchon S. Condemine G. Robert-Baudouy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The signals obtained were detected by autoradiography on Amersham MP film and quantified using ImageMaster TotalLab version 2.01 software (Amersham Biosciences). Selection of the PecS-binding Site from Random DNA Sequences— The method for binding-site selection was adapted from Tuerk and Gold (30Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8055) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were synthesized: R76, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGN26GAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′, where N indicates that either G, A, T, or C was inserted at that position; RC23, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGCGACTTCGTATATTACGACGTCGGAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′; RC13, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGTCGTATATTACGAGAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′; O-celZ, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGTATTGAAAATTCCGAGAATGAATCTAGCATGAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′; O-pecS, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCGCGTATGCGTATATTACGAAATCGGAGGCGAATTCAGTGCAACTGCAGC-3′ pR, 5′-CAGGTCAGTTCAGCGGATCCTGTCG-3′; pF, 5′-GCTGCAGTTGCACTGAATTCGCCTC-3′. Double-stranded DNA fragments were generated by one round of PCR with 0.2 μm oligonucleotides R76, RC23, RC13, O-pecS, or O-celZ as a template and 1 μm oligonucleotide pF as a primer in 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 μm each dGTP, dATP, and dTTP, 4 μm dCTP, 20 μCi (α-32P)dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences), and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega). The reaction mixture was heated at 94 °C for 1 min, annealed at 62 °C for 3 min, and extended at 72 °C for 9 min; then, cold dCTP was adjusted to 50 μm followed by an extending reaction for 10 min. The reaction products were purified on a Sephadex G-25 MicroSpin column (Amersham Biosciences) and electrophoresed on an 8% acrylamide gel using 0.5 × TBE (90 mm Tris, 64.6 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) as running buffer. The double-strand DNA fragments, detected after a 5-min exposure on autoradiographic film, were excised and eluted by an overnight incubation at 30 °C in 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS. DNA fragments contained in the elution were precipitated for 30 min at —20 °C in the presence of 40 μg of glycogen and 1 volume of isopropanol. Recovered pellets were then rinsed with 70% ethanol and resuspended at 4 × 104 counts/min/μl in water. A sample (2 μl) of the resulting mixture was used for band-shift assays. The PecS-DNA complexes were then excised and extracted as described above. All of the recovered DNA was amplified by PCR with 10 μm of each primer pF and pR in 20 μl of mixture as described above. The reaction mixture was heated at 94 °C for 2 min; then, for each of 12 cycles, it was denatured at 94 °C for 1 min, annealed at 62 °C for 1 min, and extended at 72 °C for 1 min. The reaction products were purified on a Sephadex G-25 MicroSpin column and used for the next step of selection. After a total of seven rounds of selection and amplification, the eluted DNA was cloned into a pCR 2.1 vector system. After transformation into E. coli strain DH5α, the plasmids were recovered, and the cloned regions were sequenced and analyzed using MEME software. 2Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME) software is available on the World Wide Web at meme.sdsc.edu/meme/website/intro.html. In Vitro Transcription—Supercoiled plasmid was used for in vitro transcription and primer extension reactions according to Lazarus and Travers (31Lazarus L.R. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The mRNA obtained after in vitro transcription was divided into equal parts and used for primer extension by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) with radioactively end-labeled primers celZ1 for celZ mRNA and bla3B4 (5′-CAGGAAGGCAAAATGCCGC-3′) for the bla transcript. The extension with primers celZ1 and bla3B4 yields 151- and 100-bp fragments, respectively. The amount of the celZ transcript produced was quantified and normalized to that of bla. Potassium Permanganate Reactivity Assay—The reactions for potassium permanganate reactivity assays were performed with supercoiled templates. The reactions were performed similarly to those used for in vitro transcription, with minor modifications: plasmid DNA (500 ng) and proteins, as indicated, were incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science). After incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 0.1 volume of 100 mm potassium permanganate solution was added for 15 s to the reaction mixtures containing DNA and proteins. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 volume of 14 m β-mercaptoethanol, 40 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science) and sodium acetate to 0.3 m, precipitated with 3 volumes of ice-cold ethanol, and washed twice with 70% ethanol. The reaction products were solubilized in water and used as a template for five cycles of amplification by Taq polymerase with 5′-radio-labelled celZ1 to reveal the modified bases. The amplification products were analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. Selection of the PecS-binding Site from a Pool of Random DNA Sequences—Traditional in vitro methods for identifying protein binding sites, such as DNase I footprinting or missing contact experiments, failed to reveal a DNA-binding consensus for PecS (22Nasser W. Schevchik V.E. Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Hugouvieux-Cotte-Pattat N. Schevchik V.E. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2664-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 25Praillet T. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Reverchon S. Mol.

Noumura K. Tsuyumu S. Nasser W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5948-5957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a SELEX strategy for selecting targets from random DNA sequences was adopted. The oligonucleotides used for selection (R76) carried constant flanking sequences for PCR, whereas the central 26 nucleotides were randomized. The enrichment of PecS-binding sites was achieved by a combination of band-shift assays and PCR amplifications. O-celZ is an 80-base pair oligonucleotide having the known high-affinity PecS-binding site of celZ as the central 30-base pair (26Praillet T. Reverchon S. Nasser W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). O-celZ was used as a control to monitor the degree of enrichment at the different steps of selection. At the PecS concentration used (7 nm), only a very weak complex was observed with R76 at the beginning of the selection, whereas at least 25% of the O-celZ probe was shifted (Fig. 1). The selection-amplification cycle was repeated until no significant enrichment was observed from one step to another. This was achieved between cycles 7 and 8, wherein 7 nm of PecS caused at least 55% of the total DNA probe to be in a complex (Fig. 1). At this stage, it is supposed that a fairly pure population of high-affinity sites is selected. The DNA fragments recovered from the PecS-DNA complexes obtained after seven cycles of selection were cloned into the pCR 2.1 plasmid. Sequencing revealed 21 unique DNA fragments out of a total of 30 recovered (Fig. 2). Band-shift assays were performed with the 21 retained DNA sequences to determine their relative affinities for PecS. Protein was in excess over DNA in these experiments, and the apparent dissociation constant (Kd) was taken as the concentration of PecS that drove half of the DNA into a complex. The Kds ranged from values similar to that of the celZ operator (10 nm) to that of the pecS operator (2 nm, the strongest natural site yet identified).Fig. 2Alignment of sequences from 21 PecS-binding sites. The alignment was carried out with MEME software. The plus and minus signs indicate the orientation of the sequence selected by the software for the alignment and correspond to the top and the bottom strands of DNA, respectively. The nucleotides localized in the central randomized part are indicated by capital letters; lowercase letters correspond to the constant flanking sequences. Black boxes, nucleotides displaying a conservation rate higher than 75% (among the 21 sequences); dark gray, conservation rates between 75–50%; light gray boxes, conservation rates between 50–40%. *, nucleotides conserved in all of the sequences. The deduced consensus from the alignment is indicated by the same shading. Bottom, nucleotides of the consensus conserved in O-pecS and O-celZ are indicated by black boxes. The affinity of PecS for the different binding sites is indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the relative affinity of the 21 isolates varied in a 4-fold range, it was concluded that the selected DNA fragments contained PecS-binding sites. Analysis of the random sequence of the 21 selected sites was performed with the MEME software to identify a consensus motif. Based upon a matrix analysis, this software identifies conserved motifs among DNA sequences (32Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Intelligent Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). The results of this computer analysis were refined by taking into account the invariant nucleotides located next to the 26 variable bases. This approach allowed for the identification of a palindromic-like consensus sequence of 23 bases: (C—11G—10A—9N—8W—7T—6C—5G—4T—3A—2)T—1A0T1 (T2A3C4G5A6N7N8N9C10G11) (Fig. 2). This consensus is characterized by the presence at both ends of C and G residues, as well as by two inverted sequences, T—6C—5G—4T—3A—2 and T2A3C4G5A6, located in the central part. Within this consensus, the four bases, G—4, A—2, T2, and C4, displaying the highest conservation rate (present in more than 90% of the selected sequences) could play a key role in the interaction with PecS. However, the consensus defined therein still tolerates an important variability, especially at positions —8, 7, 8, and 9. As a general rule, the PecS regulator displays higher affinities for the operators which have closer similarity with the defined consensus (Fig. 2). Two sequences, RC23 (5′-CGACTTCGTATATTACGACGTCG-3′), which has the most conserved nucleotides at the different positions, and RC13, which contains the central part of the consensus (—6 to 6) (Table I), were designed to validate the deduced consensus. Titration experiments performed on these two oligonucleotides revealed that PecS displays for RC23 a Kd corresponding to the mean value observed for the majority of the 21 selected sites (5 nm), whereas the affinity measured with RC13 (Kd of 23 nm) is 4.5-fold lower than that for RC23 (Fig. 3). These results confirm that (i) the consensus defined indeed corresponds to the PecS-binding site, (ii) the most highly conserved central part of the consensus is sufficient to have a specific interaction with PecS, and (iii) the bases that are relatively degenerated, located at both sides of the inverted repeats, contribute to the PecS affinity for its sites.Table ISummary of alignment of selected PecS binding site The color code is the same as for Fig. 2. Open table in a new tab We also constructed mutant operators in which the entire left (—11 to —1) or right (+1 to +11) half of the consensus was deleted. PecS did not bind significantly with these two oligonucleotides in the band-shift assay (data not shown), suggesting that the palindromic structure is required for the PecS dimer binding. Consensus Base Pairs Required for High-affinity PecS Binding—To assess the contribution of the highly conserved bases G—4, A—2, T2, and C4 to the promoter activity, we synthesized various derivatives of the oligonucleotide RC23 containing one or two changes at the positions mentioned (Fig. 4). The DNA-binding properties of the PecS protein were examined first on single-mutant oligonucleotides that carried G—4/A, A—2/C, T2/A, and C4/T. Figs. 3 and 4 show that the G—4/A mutant exhibited a decreased affinity of 2.5-fold for PecS, compared with that of the RC23 wild-type fragment, whereas the A—2/C, T2/A, and C4/T substitutions caused a still more severe binding defect (between 9- and 12-fold decrease of PecS affinity) (Figs. 3 and 4). In addition, a substitution was introduced at position —1 (T—1/A) to convert the central part of the consensus into a perfect palindrome and at position 0 (A0/C) to evaluate the importance of the base at the central position. No significant difference was observed with these two mutated oligonucleotides (data not shown). Thus it appears that the four highly conserved bases, and particularly A—2, T2, and C4, are required for efficient binding of PecS to DNA. The fact that the S1 sequence selected during the SELEX procedure, which displays a T base at position —4, shows the lowest binding capacity for PecS is consistent with this assertion. Next, we used individual mutants containing two changes, one in each half of the consensus. Binding of PecS to the mutant operators in band-shift assays revealed severe reductions in affinity for two of the mutants (G—4/A + T2/A and A—2/C + C4/T, showing a 16- and a 23-fold decrease in PecS affinity, respectively) and a quasi-total impairment in the binding of PecS for two of the mutants (A—2/C + T2/A and G—4/A + C4/T) (Figs. 3 and 4). These data reveal that the modification of two bases located symmetrically in relation to the center (—4 and +4or —2 and +2) affect more strongly the binding of PecS than does any other combination. Indeed, whereas each single T2/A and C4/T mutant similarly affects the PecS binding, t"

Furin inhibitors reported as yet are peptide derivatives and proteins, with the exception of andrographolides, which are natural compounds. Here we report that the small and highly stable compounds M(chelate)Cl2 (M is copper or zinc) inhibit furin and Kex2, with Cu(TTP)Cl2 and Zn(TTP)Cl2 as the most efficient inhibitors. (TTP is 4′-[p-tolyl]-2,2 ′:6′,2″-terpyridine.) Inhibition is irreversible, competitive with substrate, and affected by substituents on the chelate. The free chelates are not inhibitors. Solvated Zn2+ is less potent than its complexes. This is true also for copper and Kex2. However, solvated Cu2+ (kon of 25,000 ± 2,500 s–1) is more potent than Cu(TTP)Cl2 (kon = 140 ± 13 s–1 and allows recovery of furin activity prior to a second inhibition phase. A mechanism that involves coordination to the catalytic histidine is proposed for all inhibitors. Target specificity is indicated by the fact that these metal chelate inhibitors are much less potent toward Kex2, the yeast homologue of furin. For example, kon with Zn(TTP)Cl2 is 120 ± 20 s–1 for furin, but only 1.2 ± 0.1 s–1 for Kex2.

Furin is a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs). These structurally related serine proteases are located within the secretory pathway of the cell, where they cleave protein precursors at the C-terminal side of single or paired basic residues (1Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Steiner D.F. Dalbey R.E. Sigman D.S. The Enzyme XXII.

The inactive precursors processed by SPCs are transformed to biologically active hormones, receptors, growth factors, neuropeptides, and enzymes. SPCs, and especially furin, also play a major role in pathogenesis (4Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 5Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Human furin processes elements of various bacterial toxins, including anthrax, diphtheria, shigella, and pseudomonas, enabling their entry into host cells. This is achieved by furin molecules on the outer surface of the host cell plasma membrane or in the endocytic pathway (4Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 5Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the trans Golgi network, furin processes the envelope glycoproteins profusogens of many viruses during their biosynthesis. In the absence of processing by furin, new viruses released from the host cell are unable to fuse with uninfected cells. Viruses exploiting human furin include ebola, HIV-1, measles, avian influenza, Newcastle disease virus, and cytomegalovirus (4Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 5Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Because furin is expressed in practically all body tissues and cell types (5Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and because it is essential for the effects of so many aggressive pathogens, its inhibitors may be envisioned as wide spectrum antidotes against known and even unknown biological threats (7Jean F.

Such broad spectrum intervention may be most useful in an unexpected bioterror attack. Inhibition of purified furin and the other SPCs has been demonstrated with proteins and peptides (3Rockwell N.C.

These include: (a) natural endogenous inhibitors of SPCs, (b) prodomains that are part of the inactive pro-SPC (these block pro-SPC proteolytic activity during synthesis and are removed by post-translational modification), and (c) peptides that have no physiological connection to the activity of SPCs. A few of these inhibitors are potent, reaching IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (3Rockwell N.C. Krysan D.J. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4525-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 6.Fugère, M., and Day, R. Curr. Pharma. Des. 8, 125–133Google Scholar, 8Komiyama T. VanderLugt B. Fugère M. Day R. Kaufman R.J.

The only non-protein, non-peptide inhibitor of furin reported to date is a neoandrographolide, a diterpene lactone extracted from the medicinally active plant Andrographis paniculata, and its succinoyl ester derivatives (9Basak A. Cooper S. Roberge A.G. Banik U.K. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The IC50 values reported are in the high micromolar and low millimolar range. Here we report the inhibition of furin by copper and zinc complexes of terpyridine derivatives, with IC50 values of 5–10 μm (kon = 120–140 s–1). Our compounds are stable under various conditions and are not expected to pose delivery problems, qualities vital for the development of a wide-scope anti-bioterror agent for civil and military uses. Enzyme, Substrate, and Reagents—Substrate BOC-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg↓MCA (BOC, t-butoxycarbonyl; MCA, methylcoumarinamide) was purchased from Bachem. Its concentration was determined according to the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) product fluorescence after complete digestion with Kex2.

Solvents for organic syntheses were from Fisher or Acros, ACS grade or higher. Chelates and ligands were purchased from Aldrich (except for 4′-[4-methoxyphenyl]-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (MPT), which was from Alfa-Aesar) at the highest purity level available and were used without further processing. Zn(chelate)Cl2 compounds were prepared according to published procedures (14Hill M.G. Bailey J.A. Miskowski V.M. Gray H.B. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 35: 4585-4590Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Constable E.C. Lewis J. Liptrot M.C. Raithby P.R. Inorg. Chim.

J. Chem. 1970; 23: 673-682Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other Cu(chelate)Cl2 compounds were prepared according to the same modified procedure (16Harris C.M. Lockyer T.N. Aust. J. Chem. 1970; 23: 673-682Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Compound composition was verified by elemental analysis (C, H, and N). Stock solutions of free chelates and metal compounds were made up in pure Me2SO. Buffer pH was adjusted with HCl and NaOH solutions. Inhibition Assays—Furin (3 nm) and varying concentrations of either a 1:1 mixture of MCl2 (where M is Zn, Cu, Hg) and chelate or prepared M(chelate)Cl2 complex or MCl2 alone were incubated in 96-well plates at 22 °C for 2 h in assay buffer (20 mm NaMES, pH 7.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% Me2SO, [NaCl] = 20 mm and [CaCl2] = 1mm). The substrate BOC-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg↓MCA (9 μm = Km/2 (11Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol.

IC50 values were obtained with KaleidaGraph 3.0 from a fit of the normalized activity versus inhibitor concentration data to Equation 1,∂P/∂t=ν0·exp[−kobs·t](Eq. 1) where kobs (the apparent inactivation rate constant) is dependent on the initial inhibitor concentration ([I]0) according to Equation 2,kobs={kon/(1+[S]0/Km)}·[I]0(Eq. 2) (17Bieth J.G.

Each dose-response experiment was performed at least twice in each set and in at least two separate sets (often many more than two sets). IC50 values obtained for repeat tests within the same experiment were very close. The same is true for different experiments run within the same day. Large deviations from the mean IC50 value were observed when a new batch of substrate was used or when the substrate batch got older. For this reason, experiments that were repeated over time (such as those with solvated Zn2+ and solvated Cu2+) bear a large error. However, despite the errors in the absolute IC50 values, the ratios between the results with the various inhibitors were consistent in all experiments. Error values given are of a single S.D. from the mean. Inhibition assays with Kex2 were similar to those with furin, although conditions were slightly different. Kex2 (1.2 nm) and the inhibitor were incubated at 22 °C for 2 h in assay buffer (168 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% Me2SO, [NaCl] = 20 mm and [CaCl2] = 1 mm). The substrate BOC-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg↓MCA was added ([S]0 is 19 μm, which is the Km, Ref. 18Brenner C. Fuller R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1992; 89: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and the product formation rate was monitored as described for furin. Because zinc compounds formed with aryl derivatives of TERPY during the inhibition (or prepared before it) were fluorescent (15Constable E.C. Lewis J. Liptrot M.C. Raithby P.R. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1990; 178: 47-54Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the activities obtained at high inhibitor concentrations (>250 μm) were too low (deviating from the exponential fit). In these cases, IC50 values (all lower than 250 μm) were obtained using only low inhibitor concentration data. This was a problem only with Kex2, as it was less sensitive to our inhibitors than furin. Determination of Irreversibility—Furin (15 nm) was incubated at 22 °C for 2 h in assay buffer and either Zn(TTP)Cl2 (at 9, 18, or 34 μm), Cu(TTP)Cl2 (at 0.6, 2.4, or 9.6 μm), ZnCl2 (at 12.5, 50, or 250 μm), CuCl2 (at 0.6, 2.4, or 7.2 μm), or no inhibitor at all. With Cu2+, the experiment was repeated using 8 min of incubation, giving results that were identical to the longer incubation period. Each inhibitor concentration was run in two independent tubes. Reactions were then diluted 100-fold with buffer. Substrate (100 μm) was added, and AMC product release was monitored for 2 h as described above for the inhibition assays. (Longer monitoring was not useful because of loss of furin activity at 30 °C.) Rates of AMC product release after dilution were obtained from a linear fit to data points between 2,000 and 7,200 s. Activities prior to dilution were determined on an aliquot set aside from the same reaction mixture, using the procedure described above for the inhibition assays. The same procedure was employed with Kex2, with a few differences. Kex2 (6 nm) and either a 1:1 mixture of TTP and ZnCl2 (250 or 1,200 μm), ZnCl2 only (2.5 or 5 mm), or no inhibitor at all were incubated at 22 °C for either 30 or 90 min in assay buffer. Incubation periods were short to avoid complete inhibition. Dilution and assay procedures were the same as with furin. Rates of AMC product release after dilution were obtained from a linear fit to data points between 1,000 and 4,000 s. Determination of Kinetic Constants—Furin (at 1.5 nm to avoid substrate depletion) was added to mixtures in 96-well plates that included a constant amount of inhibitor (30 μm Zn(TTP)Cl2, 200 μm ZnCl2, 12 μm Cu(TTP)Cl2, or 100 μm CuCl2) and a varied amount of substrate (between 4.5 (Km/4) and 36 μm (2Km)) in assay buffer. Each substrate concentration was checked in at least two independent wells. After mixing, the release of AMC product was monitored at 30 °C for at least 2 h as described above for the inhibition assays. The fluorescence emitted by Zn(MPT)Cl2 at 460 nm (the wavelength used to monitor product concentration) prevented us from reliably monitoring the action of this complex. This was not a problem with Zn(TTP)Cl2. Individual traces were fit according to Equation 4,P=a+(νhν+νs)t+(ν0−νs)·(1−exp[−kobs·t])/kobs(Eq. 4) where P is [product], a is vertical correction, kobs is the apparent inactivation rate constant, vo is the rate of uninhibited reaction, vs is the product formation rate at equilibrium with inhibitor, vhv is the rate of photochemical product degradation, t is time (17Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Brinkerhoff C.J. Podsiadlo P. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Blum O. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2002; 3: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) with vs = 0 whenever the inhibition was irreversible. Equation 4 simulates slow binding inhibitors. We added the vhν·t term to account for slow photochemical degradation of the AMC product (20Kunjappu J.T. J. Photochem. Photobiol. A. 1991; 56: 365-368Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which is first order in substrate and zero order in metal and chelate (19Brinkerhoff C.J. Podsiadlo P. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Blum O. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2002; 3: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We did not examine the kinetics of a 1:1 mixture of M ions (M is Zn2+, Cu2+) and chelate here, because [M(chelate)]2+ formation is heavily favored. Thus, the changes in active inhibitor concentration could not be treated under the steady state approximation. This was not a concern with the preincubated experiments, where active inhibitor formation was completed well before substrate addition. The kinetic follow-up with Kex2 was similar to that with furin. 0.03 nm Kex2 was added to mixtures that included 19 μm substrate and either Zn(TTP)Cl2 (at 0–140 μm, concentration limited by compound fluorescence) or ZnCl2 (at 0–3.5 mm) in assay buffer. Monitoring the product release rate was as described for furin. Enzyme inhibition experiments included incubation of chelate and metal salt (or of the preassembled metal-chelate complex) together with the enzyme at 22 °C, followed by addition of the substrate BOC-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg↓MCA. Inactivation was quantified from the initial rate of fluorescent AMC product release. The results with zinc and its complexes are presented in Table I (see also Scheme 1) and those with copper in Table II.Table IEnzyme inhibition by solvated Zn2+alone, in the presence of chelates at a 1:1 ratio, and preprepared [Zn(chelate)Cl2]2Tridentate with 1:1 Zn2+IC50Zinc complexIC50FurinKex2FurinKex2μmμmμmμmZn2+ alone21 ± 3890 ± 110Zn2+ alone21 ± 3890 ± 110MPT10 ± 285 ± 8Zn(MPT)Cl29 ± 1.275 ± 1.5TTP10 ± 2100 ± 7Zn(TTP)Cl29 ± 1.195 ± 19Me2-4′-TTP—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.Zn(Me2-4′-TTP)Cl214 ± 2115 ± 6TERPY29 ± 51050 ± 160Zn(TERPY)Cl2890 ± 60t-Bu3-TERPY—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.Zn(t-Bu3-TERPY)Cl2No inh.bNo inh., no inhibition.No inh.bNo inh., no inhibition.Cl-TERPY—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.—aFree ligand was insufficiently soluble.Zn(Cl-TERPY)Cl270 ± 72200 ± 190PyCH2PP19 ± 3870 ± 200DPA100 ± 101030 ± 160Me3-[9]aneN355 ± 10>2500a Free ligand was insufficiently soluble.b No inh., no inhibition.

Open table in a new tab Inhibition by Zinc and Its Compounds—The trends among the various chelates were similar for furin and Kex2, but furin was more susceptible to the inhibition by about two orders of magnitude (Table I and see also kon values below). Zinc complexes of the aromatic derivatives of TERPY were the only inhibitors more efficient than solvated Zn2+. Yet, all zinc-chelate combinations afforded some degree of inhibition except for Zn(t-Bu3-TERPY)Cl2 which is probably too bulky. The free chelates by themselves had no affect on enzyme activity. In similarity to copper and Kex2 (19Brinkerhoff C.J. Podsiadlo P. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Blum O. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2002; 3: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), inhibition enhancement was maximized at a 1:1 ratio of metal to tridentate, suggesting that the active inhibitor has only one tridentate bound to zinc. In support of this conclusion is the observation that inhibition by preassembled complexes was practically the same as, or slightly better than inhibition by the corresponding mixtures of solvated Zn2+ and chelate (which formed the complexes in situ). These findings justify the use of preassembled complexes to study the inhibitory effects. We did so whenever a free tridentate chelate was insufficiently soluble, or when kinetic constants were obtained. Inhibition Is Irreversible—Dilution experiments reveal that furin and Kex2 inhibition by Zn(TTP)Cl2 was irreversible. To examine reversibility, the enzymes were preincubated with the inhibitor, reactions were diluted 100-fold by buffer, and substrate was added. Reaction monitoring was initiated immediately afterward (Fig. 4 shows a similar looking experiment with solvated Cu2+). When product formation was resumed after the dilution, product accumulation rates were linear with time. However, the slopes were not parallel; the higher the initial inhibitor concentration, the slower the product formation rate. This indicates that even after dilution, furin retained a substantial fraction of the inhibitor bound. The linearity of the kinetic traces indicates that inhibitor dissociation (resulting in higher active enzyme concentration and increasing reactivity) did not take place after enzyme activity was resumed. The residual enzyme activity after dilution (calculated from the slopes of the kinetic traces) and before dilution (calculated from dose-response correlation using a set-aside portion of the nondiluted solutions) shows that there was no increase in active enzyme concentration after the dilution (product formation rates differ according to the dilution factor). This holds true for both furin and Kex2 at all the concentrations examined. Furin and Kex2 inhibition by Cu(TTP)Cl2 was similar to that by Zn(TTP)Cl2, and likewise irreversible. But this was not the case with the solvated metal ions. With furin, the residual activity after dilution was higher than before dilution by a factor of 7 for Zn2+ (at 250 μm, the highest inhibitor concentration examined, 65% of the initial uninhibited activity was observed instead of 8%). With Cu2+, the activity after dilution was higher by a factor of 3 (22% at 7.2 μm Cu2+ instead of 7%). This indicates that some of the bound metal ions (but not the complexes) dissociate from the protein during the dilution process. Metal dissociation is complete within the time needed for the protein to resume product formation. This suggests two modes of inhibition by Zn2+: one irreversible (linear kinetic traces), the other reversible (rapid but partial metal dissociation upon dilution). Partially reversible inhibition by the solvated metal ions was also observed with Kex2. With 2.5 mm Zn2+ the activity was 46% prior to the dilution, but 53% after. With 5 mm Zn2+ the values were 7.5 and 22%. The metalchelate complexes were fully irreversible with Kex2. Competition with Substrate—Enzyme inhibition by Zn-(TTP)Cl2 and by solvated Zn2+ was competitive with substrate; it was attenuated by higher substrate concentrations (Figs. 1 and 2).Fig. 2Kex2 inhibition progress curves at different [S]0 (4.25–38 μm) at fixed [Zn2+]0 (2 mm). Reactions were initiated by enzyme addition at 30°, without any prior incubation. [Kex2] = 0.03 nm. Buffer was as stated under Table I for Kex2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Kinetic Data—Data obtained by kinetic follow-up of furin inhibition at seven substrate concentrations (between 4.5 (Km/4) and 36 μm (2Km)) were linearly fit in a plot of [I]0/kobsversus [S]0 (S, substrate; I, inhibitor) (17Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Using the simplified model shown in Reaction 1 we got kon values of 120 ± 20 s–1 for Zn(TTP)Cl2 and 5.4 ± 0.6 s–1 for Zn2+. The same [I]0/kobsversus [S]0 plot can be used also to extract Ki = k–1/k1 and k2 for the simplified model shown in Reaction 2. However, despite the good linear fit, the values obtained had no physical meaning (one of the resulting values, Ki or k2, is negative), and the latter model was rejected. Also with Kex2, only the model shown in Reaction 1 was consistent with all our data, yielding kon values of 1.2 ± 0.1 s–1 for Zn(TTP)Cl2 and 0.28 ± 0.03 s–1 for Zn2+. To validate our kinetic model, Kex2 was inhibited also with varied [I]0, keeping [S]0 constant. For this experiment, each kinetic model leads to a different plot. The standard plot for the Reaction 2 model ([I]0/kobsversus [I]0) resulted in poor correlation. A plot of kobsversus [I]0 (resulting from the Reaction 1 model) yielded kon values very similar to those of the first experiment (Table II). Unlike our findings with Kex2 and copper (19Brinkerhoff C.J. Podsiadlo P. Komiyama T. Fuller R.S. Blum O. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2002; 3: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), the effect of chloride on Kex2 inhibition by Zn2+ and its compounds and on furin was negligible. Mutational Analysis—Cys217 of Kex2 is adjacent to the catalytic His213. It is not known whether it takes part in catalysis (21Holyoak T. Wilson M.A. Fenn T.D. Kettner C.A. Petsko G.A. Fuller R.S. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6709-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although it is a potential site for metal binding within the active site. A C217S mutant of Kex2 was constructed, expressed, and purified (data not shown). The mutant enzyme was enzymatically active, although activity was reduced (roughly 5-fold; characterization of the effects of this mutation on catalysis will be published elsewhere). Using normalized inhibition tests (Table III) we found that the mutation had some effect on the inhibition by solvated Zn2+ and Cu2+, but none on the inhibition by the complexes [Cu(TERPY)Cl]+ and Zn(TTP)Cl2.Table IIIInhibition of Kex2 and its C217S mutant by copper and zincEnzymeIC50Solvated Zn2+Zn(TTP)Cl2Solvated Cu2+[Cu(TERPY)Cl]+μmμmμmμmKex2 (WT)890 ± 11095 ± 2095 ± 3525 ± 2C217S Kex2490 ± 2095 ± 4115 ± 425 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Inhibition by Copper and Its Compounds—Furin inhibition with solvated copper ions and copper complexes was similar to that with zinc and to our previous observations with Kex2 (19Brinkerhoff C.J.

As we have seen with zinc, all copper-chelate compounds exhibited some degree of furin inhibition (Table II), except for [Cu(TERPY)2]2+, which has no coordination sites available for target binding. Copper compounds of TERPY chelates substituted at the 4′ position by an aryl group were consistently the best, but this time the advantage in modifying TERPY was very small (Table II).Fig. 5Furin inhibition progress curves at different initial substrate concentrations (4.5–36 μm) at fixed [Cu2+]0 (100 nm).

Traces at 6.75, 9, and 18 μm substrate are not shown for clarity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Unlike our previous examples, all metal-tridentate complexes tested with furin were much inferior in potency to the solvated Cu2+ ions. As a result, the mixture of solvated Cu2+ and free chelate was superior as a furin inhibitor to the preprepared complex (by at least one order of magnitude) because of the remaining uncomplexed copper ions in the mixture. This became obvious when preincubation of copper and tridentate chelate in the absence of enzyme led to reduced inhibition under any of the following conditions: longer preincubation times, higher TERPY/copper ratios, and higher TERPY + Cu2+ concentrations (at constant TERPY/copper ratios). Furin inhibition by solvated Cu2+ was unique also in revealing two phases during kinetic follow-ups (Fig. 5). The first phase was similar to all other inhibitions we observed, although it was com"

We cloned a cDNA from SV40-transformed human fibroblasts that shares 80% homology to a rat calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase that encodes a PPM1F protein. By using extracts from transfected cells, PPM1F, but not a mutant (R326A) in the conserved catalytic domain, was found to dephosphorylate in vitro a peptide corresponding to the auto-inhibitory region of CaMKII. Further analyses demonstrated that PPM1F specifically dephosphorylates the phospho-Thr-286 in autophosphorylated CaMKII substrate and thus deactivates the CaMKII in vitro. Coimmunoprecipitation of CaMKII with PPM1F indicates that the two proteins can interact intracellularly. Binding of PPM1F to CaMKII involves multiple regions and is not dependent on intact phosphatase activity. Furthermore, overexpression of PPM1F in fibroblasts caused a reduction in the CaMKII-specific phosphorylation of the known substrate vimentin(Ser-82) following induction of the endogenous CaM kinase. These results identify PPM1F as a CaM kinase phosphatase within fibroblasts, although it may have additional functions intracellularly since it has been presented elsewhere as POPX2 and hFEM-2. We conclude that PPM1F, possibly together with the other previously described protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, can regulate the activity of CaMKII. Moreover, because PPM1F dephosphorylates the critical autophosphorylation site of CaMKII, we propose that this phosphatase plays a key role in the regulation of the kinase intracellularly.

IntroductionThe dynamic interactions between kinases and phosphatases play a critical role in the regulation of cellular processes.

In response to Ca2+-mobilizing agents, CaMKII is autophosphorylated (at Thr-286 for CaMKIIα) generating a kinase with Ca2+-independent activity (autonomous activity); however, this activity rapidly declines on removal of the stimulus (2Gorelick F.S.

In the rat forebrain, the predominant phosphatase varies with the distinct cellular compartment; PP2A dephosphorylates soluble CaMKII, whereas PP1 acts on postsynaptic density-associated kinase (8Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Google Scholar). In the case of rat cerebellar granule cells, the predominant phosphatase activity in cytosolic extracts is PP2C (7Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Google Scholar). More limited studies have examined the regulation of CaMKII by phosphatases in non-neuronal cells, including canine vascular smooth muscle cells (16Zhang S. Yang Y. Kone B.C. Allen J.C. Kahn A.M. Circulation. 2003; 107: 1539-1544Google Scholar, 17Mishra-Gorur K. Singer H.A. Castellot J.J. Am. J.

CaMKII has been shown to be expressed in these cells based on the detection of kinase activity in the following rodent and human fibroblast cell lines: NIH 3T3 (mouse embryo) (18Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070Google Scholar); 3Y1 (rat embryo) (19Ohta Y. Ohba T. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol.

Hence, this kinase may play a critical role in the Ca2+-mediated signaling cascades that have been shown to be required for cell cycle progression in fibroblasts (23Boynton A.L. Whitfield J.F. Isaacs R.J. Tremblay R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 241-248Google Scholar, 24Durkin J.P. Boynton A.L. Whitfield J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 103: 233-239Google Scholar, 25Klug M. Steinhardt R.A. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 907-916Google Scholar). In support of this possibility, treatment of proliferating NIH 3T3 cells with KN-93, a membrane-permeable synthetic inhibitor of CaMKII, induced G1 arrest (18Tombes R.M. Grant S. Westin E.H. Krystal G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1063-1070Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKII contributes to the S-phase delay in the cell cycle of γ-irradiated human fibroblasts; ataxia telangiectasia fibroblasts fail to undergo this delay because of the inability of these cells to activate CaMKII following γ-irradiation (22Famulski K.S. Paterson M.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 183-186Google Scholar), and normal fibroblasts treated with KN-62, a pharmacological inhibitor of CaM kinases, exhibit an “ataxia telangiectasia-like” phenotype after γ-ray treatment (26Mirzayans R. Famulski K.S. Enns L. Fraser M. Paterson M.C. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1597-1605Google Scholar). As has been observed with neuronal cells, the increase in autonomous CaMKII activity was transient in the γ-irradiated normal fibroblasts, suggesting that the rapid decline in kinase activity is the result of phosphatase regulation (22Famulski K.S. Paterson M.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 183-186Google Scholar).Presently, very little is known about the phosphatases that regulate CaMKII in fibroblasts. There is indirect evidence to indicate that this regulation does occur. The finding that Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, pretreated with KN-93, were protected from apoptosis induced by nodularin, a cyclic pentapeptide inhibitor of PP1 and PP2A, suggests that the inhibition of these phosphatases can lead to CaM kinase deregulation and subsequent apoptosis in fibroblasts (27Fladmark K.E. Brustugun O.T. Mellgren G. Krakstad C. Boe R. Vintermyr O.K. Schulman H. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2804-2811Google Scholar). We previously identified a cDNA (termed J4-3) from a subtractive hybridization screen of SV40-transformed human fibroblasts (28Pardinas J. Pang Z. Houghton J. Palejwala V. Donnelly R.J. Hubbard K. Small M.B. Ozer H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 171: 325-335Google Scholar) that matched the 3′-un-translated region of a cDNA (KIAA0015) cloned from a human myeloid cell line (29Nomura N. Miyajima N. Sazuka T. Tanaka A. Kawaraboyashi Y. Sato S. Nagase T. Seki N. Ishikawa K. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1994; 1: 27-35Google Scholar) that contained a putative PP2C phosphatase motif. Since then, two groups of investigators have independently isolated the same cDNA from different sources and have named it hFEM-2 (30Tan K.M.L. Chan S.-L. Tan K.O. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44193-44202Google Scholar) and POPX2 (31Koh C.-G. Tan E.-J. Manser E. Lim L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 317-321Google Scholar), depending on its identified function. Both groups recognized what we had found earlier during the course of our investigation, 2B. P. Harvey and H. L. Ozer, The 2001 Annual Retreat on Cancer Research in New Jersey, April 25, 2001, Abstract P080. the human sequence shares 80% identity with the rat Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase (rCaMKPase) (32Kitani T. Ishida A. Okuno S. Takeuchi M. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 1022-1028Google Scholar); however, neither group fully investigated this possible function of the gene, other than to demonstrate that a partially purified hFEM-2 could dephosphorylate CaMKII in vitro (30Tan K.M.L. Chan S.-L. Tan K.O. Yu V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44193-44202Google Scholar). The rCaMKPase has characteristics similar to members of the PP2C family, including a dependence on divalent cations for activity and insensitivity to okadaic acid (OA), and has been shown to dephosphorylate as well as deactivate autophosphorylated CaMKII in vitro (33Ishida A. Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1904-1910Google Scholar). This phosphatase substantiates the findings in previous studies (7Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Google Scholar, 8Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Google Scholar, 10Fukunaga K. Muller D. Ohmitsu M. Bako E. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 807-817Google Scholar, 14Easom R.A. Tarpley J.L. Filler N.R. Bhatt H. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 283-288Google Scholar) that PP2C-like phosphatases play a role in regulating CaM kinase activity. To assess CaMKII regulation in fibroblasts, we determined whether J4-3, which we name PPM1F in accordance with the PP2C family designation as given by the Human Genome Nomenclature Commission, functions as CaM kinase phosphatase. Our results show that like its rat homolog PPM1F specifically dephosphorylates Thr-286 of CaMKII and deactivates the autophosphorylated kinase in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrate by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) that the two proteins interact intracellularly and, most important, that PPM1F can inhibit the intracellular phosphorylation of a CaMKII-specific substrate by the endogenous CaM kinase, indicating that PPM1F can contribute to the regulation of CaMKII in fibroblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—The normal fetal human diploid bone marrow fibroblast HS74, its SV40-transformed immortal cell sublines, and HEK293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-10 medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) as described previously (34Neufeld D.S. Ripley S. Henderson A. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2794-2802Google Scholar). Chinese hamster fibroblast CHO-K1 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (35Dermody J.J. Wojcik B. Du H. Ozer H.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 4594-4601Google Scholar). Mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 10% bovine calf serum (Sigma) as described previously (36Jha K.K. Cacciapuoti J. Ozer H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 97: 147-152Google Scholar). All cell lines were maintained in complete medium at 37 °C.Cloning of PPM1F and Construction of Deletion Mutants—The PPM1F-A cDNA (full-length J4-3) was generated from an SV40-transformed nonimmortal human diploid fibroblast cell line by reverse transcription with an oligo(dT) primer by using the SuperScript™ Preamplification System (Invitrogen) followed by PCR with DNA primers flanking the largest open reading frame of the cDNA by using Taq polymerase (Roche Diagnostics). PPM1F-A was cloned into pIRES2EGFP (Clontech), and an HA epitope tag was introduced at the C-terminal end by ligating a double-stranded oligo to the BstAPI (SibEnzyme) site overhang, resulting in a 4-amino acid truncated protein that we termed PPM1F-B. The construct carrying the HA epitope-tagged PPM1F-B (PPM1F-B·HA) under the control of a CMV promoter was named pPPM1F-B·HA/IG. The CMV-IE promoter/PPM1F-B·HA/IRES/EGFP/SV40 poly(A) cassette was subcloned into a vector carrying a Pac gene under the control of an SV40 origin-defective early promoter resulting in the pPPM1F-B·HA/IGPac construct. The PPM1F cDNA was generated from the ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 using the same protocol as described for PPM1F-A and was cloned into pVAX1 (Invitrogen). The nontagged version of the PPM1F Δ13-94 mutant was generated by the ligation of MscI and filled in EcoRI overhang (New England Biolabs) within the PPM1F sequence. The PPM1F cDNA was subcloned into the SalI (Invitrogen) site of pCMV-Myc (Clontech). As a consequence of generating the construct pCMV-Myc·PPM1F, an additional 33 amino acids, including the Myc epitope tag, are present at the N terminus of the Myc·PPM1F protein. All subsequent deletion mutants of PPM1F were generated by using pCMV-Myc as the vector and consequently contain the additional amino acids unless otherwise specified. The PPM1F Δ13-94 gene was subcloned into the SalI site to give the Myc·PPM1F Δ13-94 mutant. The ligation of the SrfI (Stratagene) overhang from PPM1F with that of SalI from the vector generated the Δ1-148 mutant that has only 23 of the 33 additional amino acids mentioned earlier. The large internal deletion mutant Δ148-397 was constructed by ligating together the two SmaI (Roche Diagnostics) sites in PPM1F that were the farthest apart from each other. To generate the Δ300-454 deletion mutant, the filled in overhangs of BssHII (New England Biolabs) from PPM1F and NotI (New England Biolabs) from the vector were ligated together. As a result of this ligation, the stop codon fell within the vector sequence 7 amino acids downstream of the PPM1F sequence. The remainder of the C-terminal deletion mutants of PPM1F, which include Δ411-454, Δ417-454, Δ419-454, Δ422-454, Δ433-454, and Δ441-454, were constructed by Expand High Fidelity PCR (Roche Diagnostics) by using a common 5′ DNA primer corresponding to PPM1F sequence directly proximal to the open reading frame together with an XhoI restriction site. Specific 3′ primers encode the amino acids immediately upstream of the deletion together with a stop codon at the position of the truncation and a BglII (Roche Diagnostics) restriction site. The missense mutant R326A was generated by the same PCR method by using a 5′ primer containing a conversion of the AGA codon (976-978 bp of the PPM1F cDNA) to that of GCA as well as a HincII (New England Biolabs) restriction site, and a 3′ primer corresponding to the distal open reading frame sequence, including the stop codon together with a BstAPI restriction site. The digested PCR product was incorporated into the PPM1F cDNA by replacing the original HincII/BstAPI fragment. All PPM1F constructs were sequenced in their entirety to verify that no other mutations were present. DNA primers and sequencing were provided by the Molecular Resource Facility at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School.Preparation of Phosphatase Assay Substrate—AutoCaMtide3 (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 100 μm was phosphorylated in vitro with 500 ng of purified CaMKII (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), as described previously (37Kameshita I. Ishida A. Okuno S. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 149-153Google Scholar), with the addition of 1 mm CaCl2 and 20 μg/ml calmodulin to the reaction mixture ([γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)). The reaction was diluted with 3× phosphatase reaction buffer containing 33.3 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.33 mm EGTA (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 25 μm32P-AutoCaMtide3. Labeled peptide was separated from kinase protein by centrifugation through Microcon-10 microconcentrators (Millipore).Phosphatase Assays—Depending on the experimental conditions, phosphatase assays were performed to evaluate the activity of exogenous PPM1F in a variety of cell types. For the time course analysis as well as the immunoprecipitation experiments, CHO-K1 were seeded at 7.5 × 105 cells per 60-mm plate and then transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE2000™ (Invitrogen) with 10 μg of pPPM1F-B·HA/IG or vector control plasmid for 5 h. These cells were then harvested 40 h post-transfection for assay. For the phosphatase assays involving deletion mutants of PPM1F, HEK293T cells were seeded at 3.5 × 106 cells per 60-mm plate and then transiently transfected overnight using LipofectAMINE2000™ with 10 μg of pCMV-Myc·PPM1F or with specified deletion mutants. These cells were then harvested 18 h post-transfection for assay. Cell extracts were prepared in a manner similar to that described by Dhavan et al. (38Dhavan R. Greer P.L. Morabito M.A. Orlando L.R. Tsai L.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7879-7891Google Scholar) with exclusion of the phosphatase inhibitors from the extraction buffer (referred to as modified PIPES-buffered extraction solution). For each sample, an aliquot was used for protein estimation with the Bio-Rad protein assay and for Western blot analysis with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA epitope or anti-Myc epitope antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 0.2 μg/ml) and with mouse monoclonal anti-α-actinin antibody (Sigma, 1:1000) to ensure that equal amounts of protein were loaded. The blots were then stained with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rat anti-mouse κ light chain-specific IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as the secondary antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence was performed by using Western Lightning™ Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To determine the activity directly in lysates, the extract supernatant was diluted 1:4 in excess extraction buffer. Phosphatase reactions were initiated with the addition of an aliquot of diluted supernatant to a 30 °C preincubated reaction mixture consisting of the following: 7.5 μm32P-AutoCaMtide3 solution (see “Preparation of Phosphatase Assay Substrate” for details), 10 mm MnCl2, and 10 μm CaMKII-specific inhibitory peptide (CaM-KIINtide) (39Chang B.H. Mukherji S. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10890-10895Google Scholar) (synthesized by Sigma-Genosys) with or without 10 μm OA (Sigma, sodium salt). Various reaction times were used depending on the experiment and are provided in the figure for that experiment. Reactions were terminated by the addition of ice-cold 15% trichloroacetic acid. Recovery of 32P-AutoCaMtide3 as well as analysis of samples by scintillation spectrometry was performed according to the same procedure used in the in vitro CaMKII assay described by Dhavan et al. (38Dhavan R. Greer P.L. Morabito M.A. Orlando L.R. Tsai L.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7879-7891Google Scholar). A sample devoid of cell extract was included with each assay as a control to define the total amount of 32P incorporated in the substrate. The difference of the sample (experimental) values from control (starting) indicated the amount of PO4 released from the peptide as a result of phosphatase activity. To assess the activity of immunoprecipitated PPM1F-B·HA, cell extracts were prepared as stated previously with the exception that the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of each supernatant was retained at 4 °C for the phosphatase reaction as well as for Western blot analysis by using anti-HA epitope antibody. To 500 μg of total protein for each sample, 20 μg of agarose conjugated anti-HA epitope (anti-HA-AC) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the agarose beads were washed twice with ice-cold modified PIPES-buffered extraction solution (5 min per wash) at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then resuspended in a minimal amount of extraction buffer and immediately added to the phosphatase reaction mixture. The reactions were completed following the protocol listed above.In Vitro Dephosphorylation of CaMKII—HEK293T were transiently transfected overnight with 10 μg of plasmid for the following genes: mCaMKIIα (pME18S-CaM Kinase II, a gift from Dr. Thomas R. Soderling (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR)), Myc·PPM1F, Myc·PPM1F R326A, Myc·PPM1FΔ419-454, Myc·PPM1FΔ422-454, or vector plasmids. Cells were then harvested 18 h post-transfection, and cell extracts were prepared in a similar manner as described under “Phosphatase Assays.” To activate CaMKII exogenously, aliquots (∼40 μg of total cellular protein per reaction) of mCaMKIIα-containing lysate were used in limiting autophosphorylation reactions as described previously by Brickey et al. (40Brickey D.A. Bann J.G. Fong Y.-L. Perrino L. Brennan R.G. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29047-29054Google Scholar) with the addition of 10 μm OA. Further activation was inhibited by the addition of 50 μm KN-93 (Calbiochem, water-soluble). To dephosphorylate CaMKII, aliquots of activated mCaMKII were added to the phosphatase reaction buffer containing 2 mm MnCl2, 10 μm OA, and 50 μm KN-93. These reactions were initiated by the addition of extract (∼50 μg of total cellular protein per reaction) prepared from cells transfected with Myc·PPM1F (or related construct) and were incubated for 30 min at 23 °C before being terminated with the addition of SDS loading buffer. Replicate samples were pooled and then analyzed by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal anti-ACTIVE™ CaMKII (pT286) (also known as anti-phospho-CaMKIIα/β (Thr-286/Thr-287)) (Promega, 1:1000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal anti-CaMKIIα (Sigma, 5 μg/ml), and anti-Myc epitope-specific antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody for the rabbit polyclonal antibodies.In Vitro Deactivation of CaMKII—The steps to the point of terminating the phosphatase reaction were done essentially the same way as described under “In Vitro Dephosphorylation of CaMKII.” In place of SDS loading buffer, 400 mm β-glycerophosphate, a nonspecific inhibitor of protein phosphatases, was added to each phosphatase reaction to give a final concentration of 80 mm in the kinase reaction. Autonomous CaMKII activity was assessed (for 3 min) for aliquots of this mixture utilizing the in vitro CaMKII assay protocol previously described by Dhavan et al. (38Dhavan R. Greer P.L. Morabito M.A. Orlando L.R. Tsai L.-H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7879-7891Google Scholar) (kinase assay kit from Invitrogen) with the following additions: OA (10 μm), KN-93 (50 μm), protein kinase A (Sigma, protein kinase inhibitor), and protein kinase C (fragment 19-36, Sigma) inhibitors were included in the reaction buffer at a final concentration of 0.4 μm each. Bio-Rad protein assay was used for protein estimation.Coimmunoprecipitations—HEK293T cells were transiently cotransfected with 5 μg of pCMV-CaMKIIwt (CaMKII cDNA subcloned from pME18S-CaM kinase II (provided by Dr. Thomas R. Soderling) into pVAX1 (Invitrogen)) and 5 μg of pCMV-Myc·PPM1F or specified deletion mutant plasmid. Cell extracts were prepared as described previously by Aplin and Juliano (41Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 695-706Google Scholar) using the modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer with the exception that the protease inhibitors were substituted with the following: 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml Pefabloc® SC (Roche Diagnostics). Protein estimation was performed on the supernatant using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). For each sample, 500 μg of total cellular protein was pre-cleared with 20 μg of anti-HA-AC antibody for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged. Twenty micrograms of agarose-conjugated anti-Myc epitope (anti-Myc-AC) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the supernatant, and the immunoprecipitation (IP) reaction was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was centrifuged and washed three times at 4 °C as follows: once with ice-cold modified RIPA buffer containing 1 m NaCl for 10 min, and then twice more with ice-cold modified RIPA buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl. The immunoprecipitate was resuspended in modified RIPA buffer and SDS loading buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit polyclonal anti-CaMKIIα and anti-Myc epitope-specific antibodies. For each sample, 20 μg of cell lysate was analyzed by Western blot with the same anti-CaMKIIα antibody.CaMKII-specific Phosphorylation of Vimentin—For the experiments with endogenous CaM kinase, NIH 3T3 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate (3 plates per plasmid) and then were transiently transfected for 5 h using LipofectAMINE PLUS™ (Invitrogen) with 10 μg per plate of pPPM1F-B·HA/IGPac or vector. For the experiments with the constitutively active CaMKII mutant, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently cotransfected with 3 μg of pRSV-CaMKII-(1-290) (a gift from Dr. Thomas R. Soderling) and 10 μg of pPPM1F-B·HA/IGPac or vector. Eighteen hours post-transfection, cells from each 100-mm plate were transferred into a single 150-mm plate with complete medium containing 4 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma).

The GGAs contain four different domains named Vps27, Hrs, Stam (VHS); GGAs and TOM1 (GAT); hinge; and γ-adaptin ear (GAE). The VHS domain recognizes transmembrane cargo, whereas the hinge and GAE regions bind clathrin and accessory proteins, respectively. The GAT domain is a polyfunctional module that interacts with various partners including the small GTPase ARF, the endosomal fusion regulator Rabaptin-5, ubiquitin, and the product of the tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101). Previous x-ray crystallographic analyses showed that the GAT region is composed of two subdomains, an N-terminal helix-loop-helix containing the ARF binding site, and a C-terminal triple α-helical (trihelical) bundle. In this study, we define the Rabaptin-5 binding site on the GGA1-GAT domain and its relationship to the binding sites for ubiquitin and TSG101. Our observations show that Rabaptin-5, ubiquitin, and TSG101 bind to overlapping but distinct binding sites on the trihelical bundle.

Three GGAs (i.e. GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3) have been described in humans, and 1–3 GGAs have been described in other organisms from yeast to mammals. The GGAs have a modular structure consisting of four domains or regions named Vps27, Hrs, Stam (VHS), GGAs and TOM1 (GAT), hinge, and γ-adaptin ear (GAE) (Fig. 1A). The VHS domain binds acidic cluster-dileucine sorting signals present in the cytosolic domains of transmembrane cargo proteins such as the mannose 6-phosphate receptors (2Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C.

McPherson P.S. Bonifacino J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8018-8028Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that, like the GAE domain, the GAT domain of the GGAs has multiple binding partners. In addition to ARF, the GAT domains of GGA1 and GGA2, but not GGA3, interact with Rabaptin-5 (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar). Since the GAE domain also binds Rabaptin-5, this indicates that the interactions of GGA1 and GGA2 with Rabaptin-5 are divalent. Whereas the GAE domain binds the ΨG(P/D/E)(Ψ/L/M)-fitting sequence FG-PLV (residues 439–443) in the central unstructured region of Rabaptin-5, the GAT domain of GGA1 and GGA2 binds to a C-terminal region of Rabaptin-5 predicted to form two coiledcoils (referred to as C2-1 and C2-2) (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar). Rabaptin-5 is in turn a divalent Rab4/Rab5 effector that exists in a complex with Rabex-5, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab5 (20Stenmark H. Vitale G. Ullrich O. Zerial M. Cell. 1995; 83: 423-432Google Scholar, 21Vitale G. Rybin V. Christoforidis S. Thornqvist P. McCaffrey M. Stenmark H. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1941-1951Google Scholar, 22Horiuchi H. Lippe R.

The Rabaptin-5-Rabex-5 complex participates in endosomal tethering/fusion events, and its interaction with the GGAs could promote tethering and fusion of GGA-coated carrier vesicles with endosomes. Furthermore, the GAT domains of the GGAs, particularly GGA1 and GGA3, bind ubiquitin (24Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Google Scholar, 25Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T.

Finally, the tumor susceptibility gene 101 product (TSG101), which is a ubiquitin-binding component of the machinery involved in multivesicular body formation, also interacts with GGA-GAT domains (24Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the GAT domain of some GGAs, such as GGA1, has the ability to bind at least four partners: ARF-GTP, Rabaptin-5, ubiquitin, and TSG101. The three-dimensional structure of the GGA1-GAT domain has recently been solved by x-ray crystallography (27Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Google Scholar, 28Suer S.

It consists of an elongated structure having an N-terminal helix-loop-helix “hook” subdomain and a C-terminal triple α-helical bundle subdomain (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this “trihelical” subdomain resembles the regulatory N-terminal domain of the SNAREs, syntaxin 1a and 6 (31Misura K.M. Bock J.B. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9184-9189Google Scholar). The GAT domains of two other proteins, target of myb1 (TOM1) and TOM1-like 1 (TOM1-L1) do not contain the N-terminal hook subdomain but are also predicted to have a similar trihelical subdomain based on sequence similarity. Biochemical and structural analyses have shown that residues in the hook subdomain of GGA-GAT bind ARF-GTP (9Puertollano R. Randazzo P. Hartnell L.M. Presley J. Bonifacino J.S.

The trihelical subdomain of GGA-GAT, on the other hand, has been shown to bind Rabaptin-5 (30Zhu G. Zhai P. He X. Terzyan S. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6392-6399Google Scholar) and to contain residues that bind ubiquitin and TSG101 (24Puertollano R. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 244-251Google Scholar, 25Shiba Y. Katoh Y. Shiba T. Yoshino K. Takatsu H. Kobayashi H. Shin H.W. Wakatsuki S. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7105-7111Google Scholar). The binding site for Rabaptin-5 within the trihelical subdomain and its relationship to that of the other GAT binding partners, however, remain to be delineated. It also remains to be determined whether Rabaptin-5 binds the trihelical domains of TOM1, TOM1-L1, and the syntaxins 1a and 6. Here we demonstrate that Rabaptin-5, ubiquitin, and TSG101 bind to overlapping but distinct sites on the trihelical subdomain of GGA1-GAT and that Rabaptin-5 does not interact with the trihelical domains of other proteins. The different GAT binding partners engage in both competitive and cooperative interactions that may be important for the function of the GGAs in protein sorting. pGAD and pGBT9 Constructs—Mutations in pGAD424-human GGA1-GAT, pGAD424-human GGA1-VHS+GAT, and pGBT9-human GGA1-GAT were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers (35-mers) purchased from Sigma or Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). Mutations in pGBT9-human GGA3-GAT were introduced using the same procedure. The pGBT9 constructs encoding human GGA1-GAT (residues 148–314), human GGA2-GAT (residues 164–330), and human GGA3-GAT (residues 147–313) as well as the pGAD constructs encoding full-length human Rabaptin-5 and the 551–661 and 551–862 fragments of this protein were described in Ref. 19Mattera R.

An EcoRI/SalI fragment encoding human GGA1-VHS+GAT (residues 5–314, containing also a M233V substitution) was obtained by digestion from pGFP-GGA1-VHS+GAT and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGAD424 and pGBT9. The pGBT9 constructs encoding human ARF1 Q71L and human ARF1 T31N (subcloned into EcoRI/SalI sites) were described in Ref. 8Dell'Angelica E.C. Puertollano R. Mullins C. Aguilar R.C. Vargas J.D.

Hartnell L.M. Presley J. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Google Scholar) and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGBT9. The EcoRI/SalI and EcoRI/XhoI cDNA fragments encoding TOM1-L1-GAT (residues 200–284) and full-length synthaxin were obtained by PCR amplification from human brain and human liver cDNA libraries, respectively, and subcloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of pGBT9. pET-28a(+) Constructs—An EcoRI/XhoI fragment encoding human Rabaptin-5-(551–862) was obtained by PCR amplification from pGAD-myc-Rabaptin-5 (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar), digested, and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pET-28a(+) (Novagen, Madison, WI). The His6-tagged Rabaptin-5-(551–862) fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (Qiagen). pGEX Constructs—EcoRI/SalI fragments encoding human GGA1-GAT, human GGA1-VHS+GAT, human GGA3-GAT, and human GGA3-VHS+GAT were subcloned into the corresponding sites of pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The mouse monoclonal anti-Rabaptin-5 antibody was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The rabbit anti-GGA1 and anti-Rabex-5 antisera were kind gifts from M. S. Robinson (University of Cambridge, UK) and M. Zerial (Max Planck Institute, Dresden, Germany), respectively. The rabbit anti-GST antiserum was described in Ref. 34Dell'Angelica E.C. Klumperman J.

Transformation of AH109 cells with pGAD- and pGBT9-based constructs by the lithium acetate method was performed following the instructions for the Matchmaker two-hybrid system (Clontech). Double transformants were isolated on synthetic defined medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Interaction of fusion proteins was monitored by activation of HIS3 gene transcription following plating on medium lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan, in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of the competitive inhibitor of the HIS3 protein 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). The use of plates with different concentrations of 3-AT provided a semiquantitative evaluation of the strength of the specific interactions under study. The presence of 3-AT also minimized nonspecific interactions between constructs and prevented background growth. The preparation of bovine brain cytosol and the general conditions used in the pull-down protocols by immobilized GST fusion proteins (Fig. 7B) were described previously (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar). The effect of ubiquitin on the pull-down of Rabaptin-5 from bovine brain cytosol by GGA1-GAT (Fig. 7B) was analyzed using a GST-GGA1-VHS-GAT fusion, since we did not observe binding of endogenous Rabaptin-5 to the GST-GGA1-GAT alone (results not shown). This difference may reflect a spacer effect that improves the folding and/or the accessibility of the GAT domain in the fusion protein to Rabaptin-5. Consistent with the results obtained in the yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 5B and Ref. 19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar), we did not observe binding of Rabaptin-5 to either GST-GGA3-VHS-GAT or GST-GGA3-GAT alone. The glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) with immobilized GST fusions (30 μg) were washed and preincubated with 0–100 μg of His6-human ubiquitin (Sigma) or irrelevant proteins for 40 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 750 μl of 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.25% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (EDTA-free Complete™; Roche Applied Science) (binding buffer). At the end of this period, 600 μl of bovine brain cytosol diluted in binding buffer (1.5 mg of protein) were added, followed by further incubation for 90 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Rabaptin-5 or anti-His tag antibodies as previously described (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar).Fig. 5Identification of GGA1-GAT and GGA3-GAT mutations that result in the loss and gain of Rabaptin-5 binding, respectively. Experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 4 using the single, double, or triple substitution mutants depicted in the panels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The effect of Rabaptin-5 on the ubiquitin-GAT domain interaction (Fig. 7A) was studied with ubiquitin-agarose beads and recombinant GGA1-VHS-GAT and Rabaptin-5 fragments. Aliquots representing 1.5 μg of GST fusions were preincubated in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of His6-Rabaptin-5-(551–862) for 60 min at 4 °C in a final volume of 500 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.15% bovine serum albumin. At the end of this period, the preincubation mixtures were added to 20 μl of ubiquitin-agarose (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or protein A-agarose (Sigma) followed by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed three times with binding buffer without bovine serum albumin, and the bound proteins were eluted and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with rabbit anti-GST antiserum. Interaction of endogenous complexes with ubiquitin (Fig. 7D) was analyzed by incubating 40 μl of ubiquitin-agarose or protein A-agarose beads with 1.5 ml of bovine brain cytosol (15 mg of protein diluted in binding buffer) for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed three times with binding buffer, and the eluted proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using anti-Rabaptin-5, anti-GGA1, or anti-Rabex-5 antisera. Relationship between the Binding Sites for ARF1 and Rabaptin-5 in the GGA1-GAT Domain—We introduced various amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal helix-loop-helix “hook” of GGA1-GAT, which contains residues critical for ARF1 binding, and in a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the C-terminal trihelical bundle of GGA1-GAT (Fig. 1B; yellow and red dots, respectively, in Fig. 2). The mutations introduced in the N-terminal hook (L182A, N194A, I197A, K198A, M200A, D204A, and Q205A) were selected based on previous mutational analyses performed by us and by other laboratories (9Puertollano R.

The experiments aimed at examining GAT domain-ARF1 interactions were performed using constructs expressing the constitutively active, GTP-locked, ARF1 Q71L mutant and the inactive, GDP-locked, ARF1 T31N mutant as a negative control. We previously reported that the C-terminal Rabaptin-5-(551–739) fragment containing the C2-1 and C2-2 coiled-coil regions and excluding the Rab5 interaction site binds to GGA1-GAT and GGA2-GAT and that the Rabaptin-5-(551–661) fragment (including only the C2-1 region) is sufficient for this interaction (19Mattera R. Arighi C.N. Lodge R. Zerial M. Bonifacino J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 78-88Google Scholar). In order to detect relative differences in avidity, we evaluated the effect of GAT domain substitutions on the binding of Rabaptin-5 using three different constructs expressing either full-length Rabaptin-5 or the 551–661 and 551–862 fragments of this protein. The effects of the substitutions in the N-terminal hook and C-terminal region of GGA1-GAT on the binding of ARF1 and Rabaptin-5 were analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid system using different concentrations of 3-AT, a competitive inhibitor of the His3 protein, to evaluate the avidity of the interactions. Consistent with previous structural analyses (9Puertollano R. Randazzo P. Hartnell L.M. Presley J. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Google Scholar, 27Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev.

Toda K. Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 369-378Google Scholar), the results in Fig. 3A (left panels) showed the importance of GGA1-GAT residues Leu182, Asn194, Ile197, Lys198, Met200, and Asp204 in interactions with GTP-bound ARF1. The role of the GGA1-GAT residue Lys198 was evident only when assaying the interactions under more stringent conditions (i.e. in the presence of 2 mm 3-AT), consistent with the partial reduction in the ability of this mutant to pull down ARF1 in vitro (27Collins B.M. Watson P.J. Owen D.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 321-332Google Scholar). Substitution of some of the residues proposed to adjoin the ARF binding site in the GGA1-GAT domain (28Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4451-4456Google Scholar) (namely Met200 and Asp204 but not Gln205) resulted in a similar decrease in the interaction with ARF1 Q71L when the yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed in the presence of 2 mm 3-AT (Fig. 3A, left panels). Substitution of residues that are important for the binding of ARF1 to the N-terminal hook of GGA1-GAT did not affect the interaction of this domain with the different Rabaptin-5 constructs (Fig. 3B, left panels). An exception to this general pattern was the GGA1-GAT N194A mutant, which exhibited a weaker binding to full-length Rabaptin-5 in plates containing 2 mm 3-AT (Fig. 3B, left panels) and did not bind this construct in assays carried out in the presence of 15 mm 3-AT (not shown); however, interactions of this mutant with the smaller Rabaptin-5 fragments were normal under all conditions (Fig. 3B, left panels; results not shown).Fig. 3Effect of mutations in the helix-loop-helix “hook” (N terminus) and the C-terminal trihelical bundle (C terminus) of GGA1-GAT on the binding to ARF1 Q71L and Rabaptin-5. A, the indicated substitutions were introduced in the Gal4 transcription AD construct pGAD-GGA1-GAT, whereas the cDNAs encoding ARF1 Q71L and ARF1 T31N were subcloned in the Gal4 DNA-BD vector pGBT9. This specific design was required, since no interactions could be evidenced when the wild type GGA1-GAT and ARF1 Q71L cDNAs were subcloned in BD and AD vectors, respectively (results not shown). B, the indicated substitutions were introduced in pGBT9-GGA1-GAT, whereas the Rabaptin-5 constructs were subcloned in the AD vector pGAD. Co-transformants shown in both panels were plated on medium without histidine (–His), to detect HIS3 reporter gene activation upon interaction of constructs, and on medium with histidine (+His) as a control for loading and growth of the co-transformants. The –His plates containing 3-AT (a competitive inhibitor of the His3 protein) provided increased stringency and were used to compare the relative strength of the specific interactions under study. Controls for nonspecific interactions included co-transformation of pGAD constructs with a BD-p53 plasmid as well as co-transformation of the pGBT9 constructs with an AD-SV40 large T-antigen plasmid (T-Ag). Co-transformation with vectors encoding the BD-p53 and AD-SV40 large T-antigen provided a positive control for interactions. Lanes labeled wt show the interactions with the native GGA1-GAT domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Importantly, the substitution of all residues in the proposed Rabaptin-5 binding site located on the surface of the GGA1-GAT trihelical bundle (28Suer S. Misra S. Saidi L.F. Hurley J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4451-4456Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B and C, and red dots in Fig. 2), including the replacement of Arg260 by Glu but not by Ala, affected the interaction with Rabaptin-5 constructs (Fig. 3B, right panels). Whereas the F264A, A267D, and L277A substitutions in GGA1-GAT abolished binding to all of the Rabaptin-5 constructs, the R260E, L281A, and N284A substitutions exhibited weakened interactions with either full-length Rabaptin-5 or its 551–862 fragment but maintained recognition by the shorter fragment (residues 551–661) (Fig. 3B). However, the double substitution R260E/L281A also abolished the interaction with the Rabaptin-5-(551–661) fragment, which exhibits a higher avidity for the GGA1-GAT domain as compared with the full-length or 551–862 constructs (Fig. 3B, right panels). Significantly, the substitutions in the Rabaptin-5 binding site did not affect the interaction of GGA1-GAT with ARF1 Q71L in assays performed in the absence of 3-AT, although a slightly weakened interaction of some mutants could be observed in the presence of 2 mm 3-AT (Fig. 3A, right panels). Taken together, these observations demonstrate the existence of a binding site for Rabaptin-5 in the trihelical bundle of the GGA1-GAT domain. The experiments also show that the binding sites for ARF1 and Rabaptin-5 are largely independent, although the partial effects on Rabaptin-5 binding brought about by the N194A substitution and the weakened interaction with ARF1 Q71L seen with some GGA1-GAT trihelical bundle mutants hint at the possibility of interactions between these two separate binding sites. Rabaptin-5 Does Not Interact with the GAT Domain of TOM1 or TOM1-L1 or with the Syntaxin 6 Trihelical Bundle—The GAT domains in TOM1 and TOM1-L1 lack the N-terminal helix-loop-helix present in the corresponding domains of the GGAs (α1 helix and N-terminal portion of α2) but exhibit sequence similarity in the trihelical bundles (C-terminal portion of α2 together with α3 and α4 helices) (Fig. 2). The absence of the sequence critical for binding of ARF1 to GGA1-GAT in the corresponding domains of TOM1 and TOM1-L1 (region with yellow dots in Fig. 2) is consistent with the inability of TOM1-GAT to associate with the trans-Golgi network in an ARF1-dependent manner (9Puertollano R. Randazzo P. Hartnell L.M. Presley J. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it was of interest to investigate the possible interaction of Rabaptin-5 with the trihelical bundle of TOM1-GAT and TO"
https://openalex.org/W2082366465,"The mechanisms by which the antifreeze protein (AFP) modifies the ice morphology are identified precisely as surface poisoning by the ice binding surface (IBS) of insect AFPs and as bridge-induced surface reconstruction by the IBS of fish AFPs and antifreeze glycoproteins. The primary surfaces of hexagonal ice have predetermined face indices. The “two-dimensional” insect type IBS has regularly spaced binding intervals in two directions. It causes surface poisoning by matching and reinforcing simultaneously intersecting strong bonding directions on the primary ice surfaces. The secondary ice surfaces have variable face indices. The “one-dimensional” and “irregular” IBS variants of fish AFPs and antifreeze glycoproteins are either linearly extended with regular ice binding intervals or have ice binding sites lacking spacing regularity. These variants can bridge transversely lattice periods or shorter oxygen–oxygen distances between parallel adjacent strong bonding directions that do not intersect. Thus, one-dimensional and irregular IBS variants induce supplementary bridges cross-wise on selected secondary surfaces by mimicking strong bonding directions that are not present in the ice structure. These proteins cause surfaces with variable face indices, which in the absence of the AFPs would not grow flat, to appear in the morphology. Whereas for the primary ice surfaces it is only the morphological importance that is determined by the experimental conditions, for the secondary ice surfaces it is the face indices themselves that become adjusted in the process of maximizing the AFP-substrate interaction through attainment of the best structural match. The growth morphology of the AFP-ice system is derived from various factors, including the face indices, surface molecular compositions, relative growth rates, and the mechanisms responsible for that morphology. The theoretical formulation agrees with experiments over a wide range and resolves these, to date, unexplained phenomena. The mechanisms by which the antifreeze protein (AFP) modifies the ice morphology are identified precisely as surface poisoning by the ice binding surface (IBS) of insect AFPs and as bridge-induced surface reconstruction by the IBS of fish AFPs and antifreeze glycoproteins. The primary surfaces of hexagonal ice have predetermined face indices. The “two-dimensional” insect type IBS has regularly spaced binding intervals in two directions. It causes surface poisoning by matching and reinforcing simultaneously intersecting strong bonding directions on the primary ice surfaces. The secondary ice surfaces have variable face indices. The “one-dimensional” and “irregular” IBS variants of fish AFPs and antifreeze glycoproteins are either linearly extended with regular ice binding intervals or have ice binding sites lacking spacing regularity. These variants can bridge transversely lattice periods or shorter oxygen–oxygen distances between parallel adjacent strong bonding directions that do not intersect.

The growth morphology of the AFP-ice system is derived from various factors, including the face indices, surface molecular compositions, relative growth rates, and the mechanisms responsible for that morphology. The theoretical formulation agrees with experiments over a wide range and resolves these, to date, unexplained phenomena. Freezing is a process of ice crystallization from supercooled water. Ice should first experience ice nucleation, followed by growth (1Mutaftschiev B. Hurle D.T.J. Handbook of Crystal Growth. 1. North Holland Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1993: 189-247Google Scholar). Whether or not freezing takes place is determined to a large extent by ice nucleation (2Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Google Scholar, 35Wilson P.W. Leader J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2098-2107Google Scholar). There is evidence that fish antifreeze proteins bind to and reduce the efficiency of heterogeneous nucleation sites rather than bind to embryonic ice nuclei (2Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Google Scholar, 35Wilson P.W. Leader J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2098-2107Google Scholar). Similar phenomena were obtained and explained in Refs. 3Du N. Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Google Scholar, 4Du N. Liu X.Y. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36000-36004Google Scholar, 5Liu X.Y. Du N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6124-6131Google Scholar. The inhibition of ice nucleation is important in any antifreeze process. The antifreeze action of the AFP 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, antifreeze protein; IBS, ice binding surface; PBC, periodic bond chain; TmAFP, Tenebrio molitor AFP. 1The abbreviations used are: AFP, antifreeze protein; IBS, ice binding surface; PBC, periodic bond chain; TmAFP, Tenebrio molitor AFP. is actually first to inhibit nucleation by terminating the relevant kinetics (3Du N. Liu X.Y. Appl. Phys. Lett. 2002; 81: 445-447Google Scholar, 4Du N. Liu X.Y. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36000-36004Google Scholar, 5Liu X.Y. Du N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6124-6131Google Scholar). When the inhibition of ice nucleation fails, the AFP proceeds to inhibit the growth of ice. In this work the growth morphology is derived to first-order by taking into account the AFP-ice system. For the first time, the face indices, the surface molecular compositions, and the assessment of relative growth rates of the ice crystals as well as the AFP-induced morphological modification mechanisms are predicted, based on the AFP-ice system, by the periodic bond chain (PBC) theory developed by Hartman and Perdok (cf. some of the original references, Refs. 6Hartman P. Perdok W.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1956; 9 (721–727): 569-572Google Scholar, 7Strom C.S. Z. Kristallogr. 1980; 153: 99-113Google Scholar, 8Strom C.S. Hartman P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1989; 45: 371-380Google Scholar, 36Hartman P. Perdok W.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1958; 11 (459–464): 365-369Google Scholar, 37Strom C.S. Z. Kristallogr. 1981; 154: 31-43Google Scholar, 38Strom C.S. Z.

Meekes H. Verheijen M.A. Vogels L.J.P. Wang M. Myerson A.S. Molecular Modeling Applications in Crystallization. Cambridge University Press, New York1999: 228-312Google Scholar). According to that theory, the observed morphology is determined as a composite effect of a progression of internal and external factors. A zero-order basic theoretical morphology depends solely on the ice structure. The influence of the environment causes a morphological modification. The environment is usually the surrounding liquid, which often contains influential molecular species. Such species may exert an even stronger morphological effect than the liquid itself, as is the case with the AFP. In a first-order approximation, the AFP action, whether direct or mediated through the interfacial liquid, is the major external factor affecting the morphology, because its role outweighs by far the role of the surrounding phase. In this work, the engagement of the AFP on the ice lattice is analyzed correctly in the context of the approximate AFP-ice system, and this analysis delivers a comprehensive explanation for the observed important features of the AFP-induced morphological modifications. A second-order morphological effect would involve the growth (not the equilibrium) processes of the AFP-ice-water system, which is also an approximate system. A third-order morphological effect would involve the growth processes of a realistic scenario including AFP, ice, water, and molecular species. Both of these effects are outside the present scope. Initially, in trying to understand the AFP-induced morphological modifications, researchers carried out docking experiments with the AFP on the bare ice substrates, mainly focusing on the adsorption of antifreeze protein molecules on specific surfaces of ice (2Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Google Scholar, 10Antson A.A. Smith D.J. Roper D.I. Lewis S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 875-889Google Scholar, 11Knight C.A. Crystal Growth Des. 2001; 14: 429-438Google Scholar, 35Wilson P.W. Leader J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2098-2107Google Scholar). They relied on the “hydrogen bond theory” to explain the antifreeze action of the fish AFP in terms of hydrogen bond formation between protein residues and lattice water molecules. Subsequent mutant-AFP experiments proved that hydrogen bonding could not be the primary cause of the freezing inhibition and that Van der Waals forces were equally unable to provide a complete explanation. As a reaction to these results, some of the erroneous conclusions that were obtained were attributed to the approximation derived from considering the AFP-ice system in isolation and neglecting the role of the ice-water interface. This work will show that part of the reason for erroneous conclusions was overreliance on incorrect assumptions. In later works, researchers abandoned the AFP-ice system and carried out molecular dynamics simulations on the AFP-ice-water system (12Dalal P. Knickelbein J. Haymet A.D.J. Sönnichsen F.D. Madura J.D. PhysChemComm. 2001; (http://www.rsc.org/is/journals/current/physchemcomm/contentslists/2001/pc001001.htm)Google Scholar). However, molecular dynamics simulations such as those carried out by those authors can only deliver information on the equilibrium molecular distribution of the simulated faces, provided, moreover, that the simulations are done correctly. Noteworthily, crystal growth is not an equilibrium process, for which reason the molecular dynamics results could say nothing about the relative growth rates that are needed to explain the morphology and/or its AFP-induced modification. The molecular dynamics results merely confirmed that hydrogen could not be the primary factor of the freezing inhibition. In studying the morphology or the morphological modification, one is forced to deal with the mechanisms producing or modifying the face orientations and the surface molecular compositions as well as the relative growth rates. Examples of such mechanisms include the formation of kinks and steps (if the faces are essentially flat) on the ice crystals, the motion of steps, and the transport of impurities and heat. If the AFP is involved, the adsorption of the AFP on the ice surface and the impact of the kink and step integration kinetics should be included. These are definitely not equilibrium processes but growth mechanisms. Most of the above studies suffer from the same drawback, i.e. the ice substrates (13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar) considered were produced by cutting the hexagonal ice structure randomly and juxtaposing the AFP ice binding surface to that planar crystal cut (examples are a “different (201) cut” (in Ref. 28Dalal P. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 2000; 40: 1276-1284Google Scholar) 2See also the Antifreeze Protein Type I (AFPI) page at http://pout.cwru.edu/∼frank/afp1/. 2See also the Antifreeze Protein Type I (AFPI) page at http://pout.cwru.edu/∼frank/afp1/. or a “(201) cut 2,” which cannot be a valid substrate, and a computer simulation concluding that there is the “likely occurrence” of the (111) ice surface on the morphology (22Wierzbicki A. Madura J.D. Salmon C. Sönnichsen F.D. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1997; 37: 1006-1010Google Scholar), whereas (111) is not a valid surface because it is roughened). The crystallographic validity of the randomly obtained planar cut surfaces was not called into question. However, crystallographically valid flat surfaces need not be planar cut slices of the structure; in fact, these surfaces often exhibit heavily undulating and corrugated surface boundaries (9Strom C.S. Grimbergen R.F.P. Bennema P. Meekes H. Verheijen M.A. Vogels L.J.P. Wang M. Myerson A.S. Molecular Modeling Applications in Crystallization. Cambridge University Press, New York1999: 228-312Google Scholar). Both the AFP-ice interaction and the molecular equilibrium distribution in the AFP-ice-water system depend crucially on the detailed definition of the simulated ice crystal substrates. Whenever those substrates are invalid, so are the results. The appearance of pyramidal forms on ice crystals grown under the influence of the AFP has thus far been explained (2Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Google Scholar, 14Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Google Scholar, 35Wilson P.W. Leader J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2098-2107Google Scholar) as the occurrence of an intermediate orientation between the basal face and the primary prism. For example, it is held in Refs. 2Jia Z. Deluca C.I. Chao H. Davies P.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 285-288Google Scholar and 35Wilson P.W. Leader J.P. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2098-2107Google Scholar that reduction of the (100) prismatic growth rate could give rise to a pyramid; it is also held in Ref. 14Miura K. Ohgiya S. Hoshino T. Nemoto N. Suetake T. Miura A. Spyracopoulos L. Kondo H. Tsuda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1304-1310Google Scholar that the (201) pyramid is the result of an intersection between the basal face and the primary prism when the RD3 AFP attaches one terminus of its ice binding surface (IBS) to the basal face (001) and the other terminus to the prism (100). However, crystallographic face orientations cannot be averaged. Consider two valid growth layers, (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2), that are adjacent; none of the remaining valid growth layers is intermediate, i.e. located in between these two. Depending on the respective growth rates, one of the following two occurrences will take place: (i) either (h1k1l1) or (h2k2l2) will suppress the other if its growth rate is dominantly lower; or (ii) both (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2) will appear on the crystal, their relative importance being reflected in their relative growth rates. The following occurrence, i.e.“crystallographic averaging”, will never occur; some intermediate growth layer, which, by the above definition, is not a valid growth layer because it is adjacent to both (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2), will never appear on the crystal as a “crystallographic average” between (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2) regardless of the respective growth rates of (h1k1l1) and (h2k2l2). If averaging were a legitimate crystallographic operation, in the course of many repeatedly applied averaging operations we would hardly be observing any facetted crystals! Additionally, the following phenomena received insufficient attention in previously related studies. A broad variety of observed pyramidal ice forms has been reported repeatedly (15Zhang W. Laursen R.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 430: 372-376Google Scholar). Because one may not expect the variation in pyramidal shapes to result from a variation in the lattice constants of hexagonal ice, that variation must be based on a strong variation of the pyramidal face indices. This exceptional occurrence of variable face orientations in AFP-modified ice has not been dealt with. The unusual behavior of the AFP of one insect (Tenebrio molitor) (13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar) in producing pyramidal ice crystallites, as opposed to hexagonal disk-shaped ones, has puzzled the literature because, as will be shown in this work, previous studies failed to distinguish the predetermined face indices of the primary pyramid from the variable face indices of the secondary pyramids (17Houston Jr., M.E. Chao H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Sönnichsen F.D. Loewen M.C. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11714-11718Google Scholar). The superior activity of the insect AFPs (13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar) in depressing the freezing point of water has also remained unexplained; it can, however, be attributed to the difference between the surface poisoning mechanism on one hand and the mechanism of bridge-induced surface reconstruction on the other. In experimental observations, the diversity of AFP structures capable of inhibiting freezing is accompanied by a remarkable uniformity of the morphological modification resulting from the AFP action. The unifying structural elements that underlie the antifreeze activity have not been identified. Protein activity in inhibiting freezing is largely measured in terms of thermal hysteresis. The freezing inhibition is brought about by adsorption of the AFP binding sites on ice substrates. Freezing inhibition is always accompanied by a modification of the morphology of the ice crystallites. The converse does not hold true; a morphological modification of ice does not necessarily imply that the freezing point has been depressed, because a change in morphology can have different causes and can be accompanied by total protein inactivity (cf. Refs. 13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar, 16Baardsnes J. Kondejewski L.H. Hodges R.S. Chao H. Kay C. Davies P.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 87-91Google Scholar, and 17Houston Jr., M.E. Chao H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Sönnichsen F.D. Loewen M.C. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11714-11718Google Scholar). The particular ice morphology observed is a direct consequence of the structural details related to the adsorption mechanism of the AFP on the ice surfaces, such that different modes of adsorption trigger different crystal habits consistently and predictably. The structure of the ice binding surface of the AFP is the instrument of freezing inhibition. The known ice binding surfaces of all AFPs are fairly flat and rigid (18Yang D.S.C. Bubanko S. Xue Y. Seetharaman J. Hew C.L. Sicheri F. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2142-2151Google Scholar) and are classified as the two types shown in Fig. 1. The two-dimensional “insect-type” IBS, typical of the insect AFPs such as those of the spruce budworm and T. Molitor, is a rigid, planar, and repetitive IBS with regularly spaced binding intervals in two directions (Fig. 1a). The “fish-type” IBS, typical of fish AFPs and antifreeze glycoproteins, comprises two variants as follows: the “one-dimensional” IBS variant is linearly extended with regularly arranged binding intervals (Fig. 1b); the “irregular” IBS variant is two-dimensional and may well (but not necessarily) be planar in order to function but lacks regularity in the spatial arrangement of its binding sites (13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar) (Fig. 1c). There is a direct correlation between the IBS characteristic structure on one hand and the triggered morphological modification mechanism on the other. A summary of the AFP structures is found in Ref. 13Jia Z. Davies P.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 101-106Google Scholar (cf.Table I and Fig. 3 of that reference). Insect AFPs contain β-sheets with a strict two-dimensional array of binding sites that makes them many times more effective than fish AFPs at depressing the freezing point. Fish AFPs (types I, II, III, and IV) and antifreeze glycoproteins contain a single α-helix or mixed α- and β-loops or helix bundles or short β-strands. The most extensively studied fish type I AFP is characterized by linearly extended, one-dimensional IBSs.Table ISummary of all chain directions [uvw] emerging from the program FFACE (7Strom C.S. Z.

Less elongated pyramids with indices in the range (102)–(201), although not excluding the occurrence of (101), have also been observed (26De Luca C.I. Comley R. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1502-1508Google Scholar, 27Graham L.A. Liou Y.C. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 727-728Google Scholar) as well as combinations of such pyramids with the basal face (001) and various prisms (hk0) (17Houston Jr., M.E. Chao H. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. Kay C.M. Sönnichsen F.D. Loewen M.C. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11714-11718Google Scholar). The addition of foreign compounds can change the AFP conformation, thereby causing a transition in the ice morphology between pyramidal and prismatic (29Ewart K.V. Yana D.S.C. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Fletcher G.L. Hew C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16627-16632Google Scholar). Antifreeze glycoproteins trigger the growth of secondary prisms with indices as high as (120) or (410) that give way to the primary prism (100) at increased AFP concentrations (30Knight C.A. DeVries A.L. J. Cryst. Growth. 1994; 143: 301-310Google Scholar). Ref. 31Wilson P.W. Gould M. DeVries A.L. Cryobiology. 2002; 44: 240-250Google Scholar reports a prismatic morphology, which might possibly be the (100) prism observed in fish AFPs. Whereas fish AFPs trigger a hexagonal prismatic or pyramidal morphology, most (but not all!) insect AFPs (e.g. the spruce budworm AFP) trigger a disk-type morphology, i.e. hexagonal plates consisting of the basal face (001) and the hexagonal prism (100). Nevertheless, the insect T. molitor AFP, despite the results of docking experiments showing an increased affinity for the basal face (001) and the primary prism (100), persistently produces stubby, lemon-shaped hexagonal ice pyramids that, judging from Fig. 3 in Ref. 27Graham L.A. Liou Y.C. Walker V.K. Davies P.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 727-728Google Scholar and Fig. 7A in Ref. 19Wathen B. Kuiper M. Walker V. Jia Z. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 729-737Google Scholar, seem to maintain constant face indices such as those of the (101) pyramid face as depicted in Fig. 2. In this study we will conclude that crucial properties of the ice substrates on which the AFPs act have, in the past, been overlooked or misunderstood. Consequently, some important differences in the way different AFPs operate have not been recognized, and the respective mechanisms by which these AFPs modify the ice morphology have been misinterpreted.

Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 11339-11345Google Scholar) provides a first-principles approach to predicting crystal morphology and morphological modification. Crystal growth is governed by two-dimensional network formation consisting of periodic chains of strong bonds. The orientations and compositions of all of the possible surfaces that could grow in a flat mode are determined theoretically. Morphological modifications can be predicted when the influence of the growth environment is known. Morphological modification mechanisms are surface poisoning, e.g. (32Strom C.S. J. Cryst. Growth. 2001; 222 (2001): 298-310Google Scholar), surface reconstruction, e.g. (33Strom C.S. Liu X.Y. Wang M. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 9638-9646Google Scholar), and other factors. PBC analysis of the growth morphology of ice in the presence of the AFP leads, in a natural way, to two AFP-induced morphological modification mechanisms associated with AFPs that have, effectively, a two-dimensional IBS and AFPs that lack a regular two-dimensional character. The latter IBS type is effectively one-dimensional or spatially irregular. A general exposition is provided in this work. Detailed explanations and supporting experimental evidence of the morphological processes related to AFP, i.e. substrate interaction as regards the above two IBS types, will be the subject matter of forthcoming publications. The occurrence of crystallographic faces on a crystal cannot be arbitrary; it is controlled by the growth kinetics of the specific faces. According to PBC theory, the observed crystal morphology consists of a basic or structural morphology for which the structure is responsible and, often, a morphological modification effect due to external factors. A crystal is normally bounded by “flat” crystal faces (6Hartman P. Perdok W.G. Acta Crystallogr. 1956; 9 (721–727): 569-572Google Scholar, 7Strom C.S. Z.

By applying the PBC theory we can determine the structural morphology and, to a large extent, also predict the influence of external factors on the growth fronts if we are given information on the growth conditions. The PBC theory gives no information on the absolute size of the grown crystals. The growth of the most stable faces is controlled by a layer-by-layer mechanism. The structural characteristics of flat faces can be explained by the existence of networks of strong bonds parallel to the growing surface (hkl). Strong bonds are bonds between growth units (usually molecules) in the first coordination sphere. These surface configurations are actually networks of intersecting (nonparallel) PBCs. A PBC is, by definition, an uninterrupted chain (or bundle of chains) of strong bonds in the first coordination sphere that has a unique and well defined crystallographic direction [uvw]. The molecular content of a PBC is, at most, the entire unit cell content. Naturally, PBCs come in families of infinitely many identical parallel chains generated by lattice translations. By its very definition, a valid PBC may not contain lattice translations (between identi"

In the present work, we have addressed the question of the respective roles of the two domains in the different steps of the topoisomerization cycle. For this purpose, we prepared various recombinant topoisomerases from two model enzymes: topoisomerase I from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima and topoisomerase I from Escherichia coli. We compared the properties of the two core domains to that of the topoisomerases formed by combining the core domain of one enzyme to the carboxyl-terminal domain of the other. We found that, contrary to E. coli (Lima, C. D., Wang, J. C., and Mondragon, A. (1993) J. Mol. Biol. 232, 1213–1216), the core domain from T. maritima (TmTop65) is able to sustain by itself a complete topoisomerization cycle, although with low efficiency. Fusion of TmTop65 to the entire carboxyl-terminal domain from E. coli considerably increases binding efficiency, thermal stability, and DNA relaxation activity. Moreover, the chimera predominantly acquires the cleavage specificity of E. coli full-length topoisomerase. For the chimera obtained by fusion of the T. maritima carboxyl-terminal domain to the core EcTop67, very low DNA relaxation activity and binding are recovered, but formation of a covalent DNA adduct is impaired. Taken together, our results show that the presence and the nature of the carboxyl-terminal domain of bacterial topoisomerases I strongly determine their DNA binding efficiency and cleavage specificity but is not strictly required for strand passage.

The control of DNA topology is critical for all essential processes that require opening of the double helix such as DNA replication, transcription, DNA repair, or recombination. In hyperthermophilic organisms, this control appears more critical, as high temperature also helps open the double-stranded DNA. Thus, topoisomerases as they are able to modify DNA structure (for reviews, see Refs. 2Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar and 3Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar) appear essential in these processes of adaptation to extreme temperatures. We have recently described the properties of the topoisomerase I from the hyperthermophilic bacterium, Thermotoga maritima, whose growth temperature is about 80 °C (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At 75 °C, this enzyme has an extremely high rate of relaxation activity on negatively supercoiled DNA. It belongs to the large family of topoisomerases IA present in all three domains of life, Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya (5Serre M.C. Duguet M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 37-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 6Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This type of enzymes catalyzes the transient breakage of one strand in double-stranded DNA to allow passage of the other DNA strand, or duplex, through the break and then religation of the broken strand. The different steps of the topoisomerization cycle occur through trans-esterification reactions in which the active site tyrosine of the enzyme becomes linked to the 5′-phosphate. An important advance in the understanding of the mechanism of topoisomerases IA has been made by the determination of the spatial structures of the Escherichia coli topoisomerase III (7Mondragon A. DiGate R. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the 67-kDa fragment polypeptide from E. coli topoisomerase I (1Lima C.D. Wang J.C.

It constitutes the core domain of E. coli topoisomerase I in which are present the totality of the conserved motifs, particularly those forming the active site of the protein (5Serre M.C. Duguet M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 37-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 20: 505-512Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The structural data combined with biochemical approaches have allowed us to postulate an enzyme-bridged mechanism for topoisomerases IA (11Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol.

Biol. 2003; 329: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Like E. coli topoisomerase I, the enzyme from T. maritima can be divided into the following two domains: a core domain consisting of the first 540 amino acids of the protein, and a carboxyl-terminal domain consisting of the 93 remaining amino acids (Fig. 1). Whereas the core domains of bacterial topoisomerases I exhibit a high sequence similarity, the carboxyl-terminal domains are very divergent (5Serre M.C. Duguet M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 74: 37-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 10Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Syst. Appl.

Acta. 1995; 1264: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). They contain a variable number of zinc domains ranging from 0 to 5 (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 16Grishin N.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In E. coli topoisomerase I, there is a large carboxyl-terminal domain (268 amino acids) with three tetracysteine zinc-binding motifs (17Tse-Dinh Y.-C. Beran-Steed R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15857-15859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zinc deletion inactivates the enzyme (18Tse-Dinh Y.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14317-14320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mutation of one cysteine of the second zinc finger abolishes the cleavage specificity (19Zhu C.X. Qi H.Y. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, the core domain Top67 is inefficient in DNA relaxation and can cleave only small oligonucleotides (1Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, a potential role of the zinc domain in the strand passage step has been proposed (20Ahumada A. Tse-Dinh Y.C. BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 13Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In T. maritima topoisomerase I, the role of the 93 last amino acids constituting the carboxyl-terminal domain appears different from that of the E. coli enzyme. Indeed, we have shown that the hyperthermophilic enzyme contains a unique zinc motif that is not essential to the DNA relaxation activity and whose mutation does not change the intensity or specificity of DNA cleavage (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the respective roles of the carboxyl-terminal and core domains of the T. maritima topoisomerase I compared with those of E. coli, we have constructed, overexpressed, and purified eight recombinant proteins. These include the two full-length topoisomerases I, an inactive mutant of T. maritima enzyme, the two core domains, TmTop65 and EcTop67, and three chimeric proteins with the core domain of one protein fused to the carboxyl terminus of the other, and vice versa (Fig. 1). The different proteins were tested for various properties as follows: zinc content, ability to relax DNA, thermal stability, DNA binding, cleavage efficiency, and specificity. The results of these experiments provide a new insight into the respective roles of the core and carboxyl-terminal domains in the mechanism of bacterial topoisomerases I. Cloning and Protein Expression—The pET29b expression vector was used for all constructions. Recombinant T. maritima topoisomerase I (TmTopo I) 1The abbreviations used are: TmTopo, T. maritima topoisomerase I; PMPS, p-[hydroxymercuri]benzene sulfonate; LC, long chimera; RC, reverse chimera; SC, short chimera; PAR, 4-[2-pyridylazo]resorcinol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DTT, dithiothreitol. was obtained as described previously (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment encoding the 540 first amino acids from T. maritima topoisomerase I was prepared by PCR, using genomic DNA as template, Pfu DNA polymerase (Expand high fidelity kit, Roche Applied Science), and the following primers: 5′-AGAGGTGGAGGAGGATCCGAGTAAGAAAGTGAAGAAATATATCGT-3′ as the forward primer, containing a BamHI restriction site (underlined sequence), and 5′-GTCGTTCCTGTCGTCGACTCAGGAAAAGGATTCATAAAACTC-3′ as the reverse primer, containing a SalI restriction site. PCR products were inserted into the pET29b expression vector (Novagen) at the BamHI/SalI sites, and constructs were checked by DNA sequencing. This construction was named TmTop65. When the carboxyl-terminal part of E. coli topoisomerase I was fused to TmTop65 to yield a chimeric protein, the stop codon was removed from the TmTop65 construct. To allow the construction of chimeric proteins, DNA constructs encoding full-length protein and polypeptides from E. coli topoisomerase I were prepared. E. coli topoisomerase I (EcTopo I) was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA with 5′-AAATTAGGTAAGGTGCATATGGGTAAAGCTCTTGTC-3′ as the forward primer, containing an NdeI restriction site, and 5′-ACCTGACAGAATGTCGACTTATTTTTTTCCTTCAAC-3′ as the reverse primer, containing a SalI restriction site. PCR products were inserted into the pET29b expression vector at the NdeI/SalI sites. A DNA fragment encoding the first 596 amino acids from E. coli topoisomerase I, also known as “Top67 mutant” (1Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was also prepared with 5′-AGAAGGAGATATACATATGGGTAAAGCTCTTGTC-3′ as the forward primer, containing an NdeI restriction site, and 5′-AGTCGGGCAGTCGACCTAGCTGGTCAGAACCATCTGGTT-3′ as the reverse primer, containing a SalI restriction site. PCR products were inserted at the NdeI/SalI sites of pET29b. This construct was renamed EcTop67. When the carboxyl-terminal domain of T. maritima topoisomerase I was fused to EcTop67 to yield the chimeric protein RC, the codon stop was removed from the EcTop67 construct. Two other DNA fragments encoding the last 268 and 157 amino acids from E. coli topoisomerase I were produced by PCR using as forward primers 5′-GTTCTGACCAGCGTCGACATTGACTGCCCG-3′ and 5′-GGTTATGACGGCGTCGACGTTGAGTGTGAA-3′, respectively, each containing a SalI restriction site. For both constructs, the oligonucleotide 5′-AAAACCTGACAGAGCGGCCGCTTATTTTTTTCC-3′ was used as the reverse primer containing a NotI restriction site. These fragments were then cloned at the end of TmTop65 at the SalI/NotI sites. The chimeric proteins resulting from these constructions were named long chimera (LC, when the fragment corresponding to the 268 amino acids from EcTopo I was fused) and short chimera (SC, when the fragment corresponding to the 157 amino acids of EcTopo I was fused). A DNA fragment encoding the last 93 amino acids from TmTopo I was obtained by using the two oligonucleotides: 5′-TATGAATCCGTCGACAGTGTGTTCGACAGGAAC-3′ as the forward primer containing a SalI restriction site, and 5′-TGGTGCTCGAGTGCGGCCGCAAGCTTGTCCACTCAAGAGCCTTT-3′ as the reverse primer, containing a NotI restriction site. This fragment was cloned at the end of EcTop67 DNA construct. The chimeric protein was named reverse chimera (RC). As a result of the cloning procedures, the chimeric proteins LC, SC, and RC contained two supplementary amino acids, one valine and one aspartic acid. All the resulting expression plasmids were transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen). A colony of transformed cells was picked and grown at 37 °C in LB medium with 35 μg/ml kanamycin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol until the A600 reached 0.5. Induction of gene expression was carried out with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C(A600, 1.0–1.2), and the cells were harvested and stored at –80 °C until required. About 15 g of cells were obtained from 4.8 liters of culture. The same procedure was followed to express all the recombinant proteins. Protein Purification—Frozen cells were resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. To remove DNA, Polymin P was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.36% (w/v). After stirring for 1 h, the solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 90,000 × g. Ammonium sulfate (70% saturation, final concentration) was added to the supernatant, and the solution was allowed to stir overnight at 4 °C before centrifugation (24,000 × g for 30 min). The pellet was dissolved in 7 ml of buffer A and extensively dialyzed against this buffer at 4 °C. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min and applied onto an heparin-Sepharose column (IBF) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing with buffer A and buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl), the elution was performed by applying a gradient from buffer B to a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.1 m NaCl. Active fractions eluted around 0.5–0.6 m NaCl. They were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator (Centricon 30) before loading onto a gel filtration column (Sephacryl S-200 HR, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 m NaCl. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15% (v/v), prior to storage of the active fractions at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (21Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard or spectrophotometrically by using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient of each recombinant protein. Zinc Content Measurements—The zinc content of the wild type and mutant proteins was determined by a colorimetric method. A solution of 2.5 mm p-[hydroxymercuri]benzene sulfonate (PMPS) was added in increments of 1 μl to a 500-μl sample of a 10 μm enzyme solution (in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol) containing 0.1 mm 4-[2-pyridylazo]resorcinol (PAR). Zinc release from the enzyme was monitored by the absorbance at 500 nm of the PAR2 Zn(II) complex, whose molar absorptivity is 6.6 104m–1 cm–1 (22Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). DNA Relaxation Assay—The reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, and 200 ng of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (pTZ 18). The reaction was initiated by adding the protein solution to be tested, which was serially diluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA. The undiluted protein solution added to the reaction mixture contained 1 pmol of enzyme. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of stop solution containing 50 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS, 25% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue. Samples were electrophoresed through 2.5% agarose gels in TEP buffer (90 mm Tris phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) for 5 h at 4 V/cm. Gels were stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Thermostability Assay—The proteins were preincubated at 50 °C for different times prior to dilution and tested for their DNA relaxation activity as described above. Oligonucleotide Radiolabeling—The 22-mer oligonucleotide 5′-GAATGAGTCGCAACTTC↓GGGAT-3′, containing a unique cleavage site for the T. maritima topoisomerase I (position indicated by the arrow) (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was synthesized and purified by MWG Biotec prior to labeling at its 5′- or 3′-end. Ten pmol of this 22-mer oligonucleotide were 5′-end-labeled using 5 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Biolabs) in the presence of 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 10 μl of buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating the samples at 75 °C for 15 min. This labeling allowed us to evaluate the ability of topoisomerase I to interact with the noncovalently bound end of the cleaved oligonucleotide. Indeed, in the trans-esterification mechanism of type IA topoisomerases, the tyrosine of the active site forms a covalent intermediate with the 5′-end of the cleaved strand, leaving free the 3′-end which nevertheless remains complexed to the protein. The oligonucleotide size markers (Amersham Biosciences) were labeled following the manufacturer's protocol. For 3′-labeling, 20 pmol of the 22-mer oligonucleotide were incubated with 10 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]ddATP in 50 μl of buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating the samples to 95 °C for 5 min. Gel Mobility Shift Assay and Oligonucleotide Cleavage Assay—0.2 pmol of the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 4 pmol of protein in buffer A, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 30 μg/ml BSA, and 60 mm NaCl for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture was then split as follows: 10 μl were added to 2.5 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol; and 5 μl were loaded onto a 6% native polyacrylamide gel containing 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm glycine. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C at 150 V for 3 h and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant version 1.2 software. The second half of the reaction mixture was stopped by the addition of 1% SDS and 10 μl of loading buffer (97.5% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.3% bromphenol blue, 0.3% xylene cyanol). The samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min, and 8 μl were loaded onto an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1) containing 50% (w/v) urea in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was electrophoresed at 48 V/cm for 2 h and subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was performed using the ImageQuant version 1.2 software. In some experiments (Fig. 7), the 20-μl reaction mixture was loaded onto a 12% native polyacrylamide gel instead of a 6% gel; 10 μl were treated as described above, and the remaining mixture was further incubated with 1% SDS and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K at 50 °C for 45 min prior to being loaded onto the gel. Formation of Covalent Complexes—0.4 pmol of the 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 4 pmol of protein in buffer A for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction was stopped by addition of 2.5 μl of concentrated Laemmli buffer (312.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% SDS, and 250 mm DTT). The samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and 10 μl were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to autoradiography. Rationale for the Design of Chimeras between T. maritima and E. coli Topoisomerases I—To evaluate the respective roles of the core and carboxyl-terminal regions in the mechanism of the T. maritima topoisomerase I compared with that of E. coli, chimeric proteins were constructed (Fig. 1). First, a truncated mutant composed of the first 540 amino acids of the T. maritima enzyme, TmTop65, was chosen from sequence comparisons with other bacterial topoisomerases I (10Kaltoum H. Portemer C. Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 20: 505-512Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It corresponds to the trans-esterification domain (core) of the protein and possesses all the conserved motifs present in the family. The core domain of E. coli topoisomerase I (the first 596 amino acids), called Top67, whose three-dimensional structure is known (8Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), was also reconstructed (see “Experimental Procedures”) and cloned into the pET29b expression system as were the other constructions. The polypeptide produced under these conditions was renamed EcTop67 in order to avoid any confusion with TmTop65. The three chimeric proteins were then designed. In the first, named “long chimera,” the entire carboxyl-terminal part of E. coli topoisomerase I (last 268 amino acids) containing the three zinc fingers was added to TmTop65. Because the two first zinc fingers in E. coli Topo I were described as essential for activity, a second chimera named “short chimera” was built, in which a sequence containing only the third zinc finger and the rest of the carboxyl-terminal domain of E. coli Topo I (157 amino acids) was fused to TmTop65. Finally, to look for a possible complementation of the inactive E. coli Top67 fragment by the carboxyl-terminal part of T. maritima topoisomerase I, a third chimeric protein, named “reverse chimera,” was constructed in which the entire carboxyl-terminal sequence of T. maritima topoisomerase I (the last 93 residues) was fused to EcTop67. Overexpression, Purification, and Zinc Content of the Recombinant Proteins—Eight proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” as follows: the two full-length E. coli and T. maritima topoisomerases I, the Y288F inactive T. maritima mutant, in which the tyrosine involved in the trans-esterification reaction has been replaced by a phenylalanine (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the five constructs above described. Purified proteins were verified by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. They exhibited the expected size and purity (Fig. 2). For the E. coli enzyme, we observed a doublet band, a result also obtained in other studies but did not appear to affect its properties (23Zhang H.L. Malpure S. Li Z. Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9039-9045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Previous studies stressed the importance of zinc fingers on the activity of E. coli topoisomerase I. We thus verified the ability of the various constructs to bind zinc atoms. The zinc content was titrated by using the sulfhydryl reagent PMPS. This compound is known to release zinc(II) from zinc-binding proteins by fixation of a mercury atom on cysteine residues (22Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Released zinc is then fixed by the metallochrome indicator PAR (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results, shown in Fig. 3, indicate that in all cases the recombinant proteins produced in E. coli have incorporated the expected number of zinc atoms in their structure as follows: three zinc atoms are bound to the full-length E. coli enzyme and the LC, one zinc atom for full-length T. maritima enzyme, SC and RC, and no zinc atoms for TmTop65 and EcTop67. T. maritima Topoisomerase I Lacking Its Carboxyl-terminal Part (TmTop65) Retains Low Relaxation Activity—The core domain of E. coli topoisomerase I (EcTop67) contains all the conserved motifs found in topoisomerases IA but lacks the ability to perform relaxation (1Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This prompted us to check the relaxation activity of the T. maritima topoisomerase deletion mutant TmTop65, equivalent to EcTop67. As shown in Fig. 4, the activity of TmTop65 is reduced about 250-fold compared with the full-length enzyme at the same temperature of 37 °C. This result emphasizes the importance of the carboxyl-terminal domain for enzyme activity, possibly by increasing its DNA binding efficiency (see binding experiments, Fig. 5).Fig. 5Oligonucleotide gel mobility shift assay of recombinant topoisomerases I. 0.2 pmol of the 5′-end-labeled 22-mer oligonucleotide was incubated with 4 pmol of full-length (TmTopo I, EcTopo I, and TmY288F), truncated (TmTop65 and EcTop67), and chimeric (LC, SC, and RC) topoisomerases as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reactions were processed and resolved through a 6% native polyacrylamide gel. No enzyme was added in the control reaction (lane C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observation that TmTop65 retains some relaxation activity was unexpected (Fig. 4 and Fig. 6, 0 panel) In the same experiment, EcTop67 is totally inactive, as described previously (1Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragon A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This result suggests that the core domain TmTop65 of T. maritima is able to perform complete topoisomerization cycles, including strand passage and religation steps. Finally, because the optimal temperature for T. maritima topoisomerase is 75 °C, we also checked the activity of TmTop65 at this temperature and found that it is totally inactive at 75 °C (not shown). Thermal Stability and Relaxation Activity of the Chimeras— The results obtained with TmTop65 prompted us to verify the thermostability of the recombinant enzymes that we have created. All of them were inactivated at 75 °C (not shown), except the T. maritima full-length topoisomerase I (4Viard T. Lamour V. Duguet M. Bouthier de la Tour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46495-46503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We then systematically investigated the relaxation activities of all the proteins at 37 °C and their thermostability after preincubation at 50 °C for various periods. The results are shown in Fig. 4. The first observation is that the mesophilic and the hyperthermophilic full-length topoisomerases exhibit comparable relaxation activities at 37 °C, although the distribution profile is different. At high concentrations of enzyme, the E. coli topoisomerase I fully relaxes DNA, whereas some topoisomers remain with the T. maritima enzyme. The second observation is that removal of the carboxyl-terminal domains, yielding EcTop67 and TmTop65, has dramatic effects on their activity and stability, stressing the importance of these domains for full activity. The next question we addressed was the ability of a carboxyl-terminal domain to cross-a"

To investigate the structural and dynamic changes that occur upon membrane binding, we analyzed the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) mobility and accessibility parameters of a continuous 30-residue nitroxide scan encompassing helices D and E in repeat 2 of annexin B12 (residues 134–163) while the protein was bound to phospholipid vesicles in the presence of Ca2+.

(2002) Biochemistry 41, 1464–1473) showed that the overall backbone fold for the scanned region did not change upon membrane binding. However, side-chains in the loop between the D and E helices were highly dynamic in solution but became essentially frozen in the EPR time scale upon binding to membranes. Accessibility measurements clearly established that side-chains in this loop were exposed to the hydrophobic core of the bilayer and provide the first evidence that a D–E loop directly participates in the Ca2+-dependent binding of annexins to membranes. Other localized changes showed that the D-helix became much less dynamic after membrane binding and identified quaternary contact sites in the membrane-bound homo-trimer. Finally, immobilization of the D–E loop upon contact with phospholipid suggests that the bilayer, which is normally very mobile on the EPR time scale, is immobilized in the head-group region by the annexin B12. This suggests that annexin B12 alters membrane structure in a manner that may be biologically significant.

This suggests that annexin B12 alters membrane structure in a manner that may be biologically significant. Ca2+ plays an important regulatory role in many aspects of cellular life. Some of the most abundant Ca2+-sensing proteins in multicellular organisms belong to the annexin family of proteins. A hallmark of annexins is their ability to bind to phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Many diverse functions have been proposed for the different members of the annexin family (1Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Google Scholar), and all rely on the ability of annexins to interact with membranes. Despite its obvious biological importance, relatively little detailed molecular information is available regarding the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound form of the annexins. Images of two-dimensional crystals of annexins 4 and 5 on phospholipid monolayers obtained by electron crystallography indicated that the membrane-bound proteins had the same general shape as observed in x-ray crystal studies of the soluble proteins but lacked the resolution to draw further inferences (2Kaetzel M.A. Mo Y.D.

Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Google Scholar) Atomic force microscopy studies of annexin A5 on the surface of planar lipid bilayers reached similar conclusions (4Reviakine I. Bergsma-Schutter W. Mazeres-Dubut C. Govorukhina N. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 234-239Google Scholar). In contrast to the limited information available for membrane-bound annexins, much has been learned about the structure of different annexins in their water-soluble form. Crystal structures have been solved for several annexins (5Liemann S. Huber R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 516-521Google Scholar, 6Seaton B.A. Annexins: Molecular Structure to Cellular Function. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, Texas1996Google Scholar), and the general picture emerges that all annexins might share the same overall fold. As illustrated by annexin B12 (7Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Google Scholar) in Fig. 1, annexins typically are made up of four highly homologous and conserved repeats. Each of these repeats contains a four-helical bundle and a fifth helix that runs perpendicular to the bundle (Fig. 1). Another common feature of annexins is a somewhat curved shape that gives rise to a convex and a concave side. The convex side of annexins contains eight interhelical loops that bind multiple Ca2+ ions when crystals are grown in the presence of high concentrations of Ca2+. Based on a crystal structure of annexin A5 in which one of these Ca2+ ions is coordinated by both the protein and by the head group of a soluble phospholipid analogue, annexins are proposed to bind to membranes via a Ca2+-bridge mechanism (8Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by studies of annexin A5 that used the fluorescence of a natively occurring Trp to show that one of the eight loops, the A–B loop in repeat 3, is in direct contact with the membrane (9Meers P. Mealy T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5411-5418Google Scholar, 10Sopkova J. Vincent M. Takahashi M. Lewit-Bentley A. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11962-11970Google Scholar). However, the involvement of the other binding sites has not been shown directly. The current study employs site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) 1The abbreviations used are: SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NiEDDA, Ni(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetate. 1The abbreviations used are: SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NiEDDA, Ni(II) ethylenediaminetetraacetate. to determine structural features and molecular mechanism that allow annexin B12 to bind to bind to membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This is an attractive model system that should provide insights into the general biophysical principles that govern the interaction between proteins and phospholipids. SDSL is based on the introduction of specific nitroxide groups into the protein sequence (11Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Google Scholar). This is typically done by modifying unique cysteine residues in the protein sequence to give the new side chain R1 (Structure 1). The shape of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the nitroxide-labeled protein reflects the mobility of the R1 side chain and can be used to provide information on local (12McHaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 273: 810-812Google Scholar, 13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar) and backbone dynamics (14Columbus L. Hubbell W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 288-295Google Scholar). Measurement of the EPR accessibility parameters to paramagnetic reagents in solution can be used to determine solvent accessibility of R1 in a soluble protein and to determine topography of a membrane protein (15Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2910Google Scholar). Secondary structure of a protein can be determined by nitroxide scanning experiments in which single native side chains are sequentially replaced with R1, and the EPR mobility and/or accessibility parameters are measured and analyzed for periodic changes as a function of sequence number. Using SDSL, we have recently studied the interaction of annexin B12 with membranes (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar, 16Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Google Scholar, 17Langen R. Isas J. Hubbell W. Haigler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Annexin B12 is a dynamic protein that can reversibly adopt a number of conformations in response to changes in phospholipid, pH, and Ca2+. It is a monomer in solution, but in response to Ca2+, it rapidly forms a trimer on the surface of bilayers (16Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Google Scholar) that resembles the trimer in the crystallographic hexamer (7Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Google Scholar) composed of a dimer of trimers (Fig. 1, bottom). Annexin B12 also undergoes an “inside-out” global refolding (18Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Google Scholar) and forms a transmembrane pore by a Ca2+-independent mechanism at mildly acidic pH (17Langen R. Isas J. Hubbell W. Haigler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Google Scholar, 19Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Google Scholar). The backbone fold of the transmembrane form is completely different from the fold of the Ca2+-dependent trimer on the surface of membranes. It is not yet known whether transmembrane insertion is a general property of the annexin family of proteins but at least one other annexin, annexin A5, seems to insert into membranes in this manner (19Isas J.M. Cartailler J.P. Sokolov Y. Patel D.R. Langen R. Luecke H. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3015-3022Google Scholar). In this report, we present a nitroxide scanning study in which every amino acid in the sequence from 134 to 163 of annexin B12 has been replaced by R1 one at a time (Fig. 1). We have previously used SDSL to show that this region exhibits a structure in solution that is similar to the one observed in the crystal structure (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar). However, at low pH and in the presence of phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles, this region undergoes a massive inside-out refolding (18Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Google Scholar) and is converted into a continuous transmembrane helix (17Langen R. Isas J. Hubbell W. Haigler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Google Scholar, 20Ladokhin A.S. Isas J.M. Haigler H.T. White S.H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13617-13626Google Scholar). Herein, we show that the structure of the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound state is closely related to that of the solution structure, except with large changes in the dynamics of the D–E loop caused by direct contact with the phospholipid bilayer. The immobilization of this membrane-binding loop is likely to contribute to the stabilization of helix D, which also becomes significantly less dynamic upon membrane binding. Overall, little evidence was found for structural changes in helix E, except for an immobilization of sites on its outside surface. These changes are probably caused by quaternary contact resulting from trimer formation. Protein Expression and Purification—A series of 30 single cysteine substitution mutants that correspond to residues 134–163 of annexin B12 were constructed by methods described previously (16Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Google Scholar, 17Langen R. Isas J. Hubbell W. Haigler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing by using a Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham Biosciences). The annexin B12 mutants were expressed in recombinant bacteria and purified by reversible Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid vesicles followed by column chromatography as described previously (16Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Google Scholar). Spin-labeling and EPR Measurements—The methods used to modify the introduced cysteines with spin-label (1-oxy-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolinyl-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (a generous gift from Prof. K. Hideg, University of Pecs, Hungary) were as described previously (16Langen R. Isas J.M. Luecke H. Haigler T.H. Hubbell W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22453-22457Google Scholar). Spin-labeled mutants of annexin B12 are designated by giving the sequence position of the cysteine substitution followed by the code of the nitroxide spin-label, R1. Spin-labeled proteins were stored in dilute buffer at pH 7.4. Before use in EPR experiments, the spin-labeled proteins were concentrated in a Microcon YM-10 (Amicon) using a tabletop microcentrifuge at the recommended speed. Large vesicles with a lipid composition of phosphatidylserine (brain; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) and phosphatidylcholine (egg yolk; Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 2:1 molar ratio were prepared according to Reeves/Dowben protocol (21Reeves J.P. Dowben R.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1969; 73: 49-60Google Scholar). EPR experiments were performed on spin-labeled annexin B12 mutants (30 μg protein) in buffer (20 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) plus phospholipid vesicles. The molar ratio of protein to lipid was 1:500, and the binding of annexin B12 to the vesicles was induced by Ca2+ (1 mm). EPR spectra were obtained by using a Varian model E-109 spectrometer fitted with a loop gap resonator (22Hubbell W.L. Froncisz W. Hyde J.S. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1997; 58: 1879-1886Google Scholar). All spectra were obtained at 2 mW incident microwave power and a field modulation of ∼1 G (1 G = 0.1 millitesla). For the accessibility measurements, the oxygen concentration was that of oxygen in equilibrium with air and the chelated nickel (NiEDDA) concentration was 3 mm. EPR Spectra and R1 Mobility—To probe for local changes in structure and dynamics upon Ca2+-dependent membrane binding, we generated 30 R1-labeled derivatives of annexin B12 (residues 134–163) and recorded the EPR spectra for the soluble and membrane bound forms. Fig. 2, red traces, shows the EPR spectra for each R1-labeled annexin B12 derivative while bound to phospholipid vesicles composed of phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (2:1) in the presence of Ca2+ at neutral pH. The previously published (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar) spectra of these derivatives in 30% sucrose solution are shown for comparison (Fig. 2, black trace). Under both conditions, the line shapes of the EPR spectra reflect only internal motions of the R1 side chain and local backbone fluctuations because the rotational motion of the protein was reduced by either binding to membranes or by the presence of sucrose. Thus, the two sets of spectra can be directly compared with reveal how Ca2+-dependent membrane interaction affects local structure and dynamics. As can be seen in Fig. 2, there are extended regions in which the EPR spectra for the solution and membrane-bound state are highly similar or nearly super imposable (Fig. 2, highlighted by black numerals). These regions include most of helix E, the loop region from residues 157 to 163, and parts of helix D, suggesting that, at least to some extent, the overall character of the protein fold was retained upon Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. Nevertheless, significant spectral changes can be detected at certain positions (Fig. 2, highlighted by red numerals), especially in the interhelical loop (residue 142R1–145R1), which contains the putative membrane-binding regions. These changes occurred only in the simultaneous presence of phospholipid vesicles and Ca2+, because addition of either one alone caused no significant spectral changes (data not shown). The most dramatic effect of Ca2+-induced binding to bilayers was observed at position 144R1. In solution, the nitroxide at this site was highly mobile, similar to R1 in flexible loops in other proteins (12McHaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 273: 810-812Google Scholar). Membrane binding effectively freezes out this motion on the EPR time scale as indicated by the broadened lines, the increased separation between the outer peaks, and the concomitant decrease in signal amplitude (Fig. 2). This is graphically illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows a plot of the inverse of the central linewidth (ΔHo–1) as a function of residue number. ΔHo–1 is commonly used as a semiquantitative measure of mobility with a larger number generally indicating higher mobility (12McHaourab H.S. Lietzow M.A. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 273: 810-812Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows that of all the positions scanned, 144R1 has the highest mobility in sucrose (black trace) but nearly the lowest mobility in the membrane-bound state (red trace). This effect is not limited to position 144R1 but extends to other sites around it. With the exception of 143R1, which is already immobilized in solution, all other sites in this loop region and the C-terminal region of helix D (residues 140R1 and 141R1) experience very strong immobilization upon membrane binding (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, membrane interaction causes a pronounced large-scale suppression of mobility for D–E connecting loop region, whereas the loop regions on the opposite (concave) side of the molecule (157R1–163R1) seem to be largely unaffected. Although the overall immobilization was the most pronounced in the D–E interhelical loop regions, significant spectral changes were also observed in helix D (138R1–142R1), particularly toward the C-terminal region adjacent to the D–E interhelical loop region. To a much lesser extent, spectral changes also were observed at some sites in helix E (residues 153R1 and 156R1). To better understand the structural basis responsible for these EPR spectral changes, it is important to first consider the structure and dynamics of this region in solution. In solution, both helices exhibit periodic variations in mobility that are in agreement with their structure in the crystal. For example, helix surface sites (positions 137R1, 141R1, 149R1, and 153R1) correspond to local mobility maxima, whereas the buried residues (positions 135R1, 139R1, 147R1, 151R1, and 154R1) display minimal mobility. It is interesting that the overall mobility values in solution are significantly higher in helix D than in helix E (Fig. 3). Based on this differential mobility and other data, our previous study of this region in solution concluded that helix D was more dynamic and loosely packed than the longer helix E (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound state, the mobility of residues 134R1 through 142R1 and 146R1 through 156R1 showed a periodic change in ΔHo–1 that was again entirely consistent with a helical structure. For example, in the bound state residues expected to be buried on the inner face of helix D (135R1, 139R1) and helix E (147R1, 151R1, 154R1) were strongly immobilized and correspond to local minima for the ΔHo–1 values (Figs. 2 and 3). Based on these mobility values, it therefore seems that no major conformational changes occurred. In the absence of conformational reorganization, the differences in mobility observed especially in helix D are therefore likely to reflect alterations in the overall dynamics. Indeed, the ΔHo–1 values in Fig. 3 indicates a general suppression of R1 mobility at all sites in helix D, especially those close to the D–E interhelical loop region. Thus, helix D must have become significantly more rigid after Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. We interpret this decreased mobility after membrane binding at all positions in helix D as being caused by tighter helix packing and reduced backbone motion (Fig. 2 and 3). It seems likely that this more rigid structure is induced by the strong ordering experienced by the D–E interhelical loop region, which is likely to serve as an anchor for the otherwise more dynamic helix D. The EPR spectra and ΔHo–1 values for most positions in helix E were very similar in solution and after membrane binding. Nevertheless, we noted two sites (153R1, 156R1) at which the R1 spectra reflect a decreased mobility membrane interaction (Fig. 2). It is interesting that both of these sites fall onto the outside surface of helix E and are located at a site of contact in the crystallographic trimer (Fig. 1). Thus, the most likely explanation for this immobilization is the formation of quaternary contacts between different subunits in a membrane bound-trimer. Accessibility to Oxygen and NiEDDA and Structural Model of Membrane-bound Form—Data presented in the previous section indicated that the loop between the D and E helices became dramatically less dynamic after Ca2+-dependent membrane binding (Fig. 2 and 3). Because this region is located on the convex surface of annexin B12, it is likely that it might directly interact with the membrane. To test this notion and to obtain more detailed structural information, we measured the accessibility parameters Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) for R1 at each position in the scanned region of annexin B12. For a protein in aqueous solution, accessibility to these colliders depends on the local structure, in particular the degree to which R1 becomes buried in the protein. As a consequence, the periodic oscillations of both Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) along a helix are largely in phase. For a membrane protein, topography is the most important factor in determining accessibility, because a site exposed to the membrane will exhibit strong accessibility to O2, which partitions into the hydrophobic core of the membrane, but weak accessibility to the more hydrophilic NiEDDA (15Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2910Google Scholar). Fig. 4, top, shows that Π(O2) and Π(NiEDDA) were in phase in both helical regions of the membrane-bound protein, demonstrating that the helices behave like regions in a soluble protein and are therefore not in immediate contact with the phospholipid bilayer. Furthermore, the accessibility to O2 and NiEDDA were high throughout the loop region from residue 157R1 to 163R1 as would be expected for a loop region that was not in membrane proximity. On the other hand, 142R1, 144R1, and 145R1 had high Π(O2), characteristic of an R1 residue that interacts with the bilayer. The contrast parameter Φ = ln{Π(O2)/Π(NiEDDA)} is useful for identifying nitroxide side chains that are exposed to bilayers with high Φ values corresponding to membrane exposure (15Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2910Google Scholar). Fig. 4, bottom, presents a plot of Φ as a function of sequence position in the scanned region of annexin B12 with the exception of positions 147R1, 151R1, 154R1, and 155R1, which were excluded from this analysis because the Π values at these positions were near zero. Fig. 4, bottom, clearly identifies 142R1, 144R1, and 145R1 as sites that are directly exposed to bilayers (Fig. 4, bottom). In striking contrast to the high Φ values obtained for these three residues in the membrane-bound protein, low Φ values were measured (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar) in solution for 142R1, 144R1 and 145R1 (–0.87, –1.10, and –1.11, respectively). The other residue in the loop between the two helices, 143R1, had moderate accessibility to both O2 and NiEDDA (Fig. 4, top) and a low Φ value (Fig. 4, bottom) in the membrane-bound state, thereby indicating that it was not in direct contact with the bilayers. Thus, despite the fact that 143R1 is flanked by residues that interact directly with the bilayer, its side chain seems to face away from the bilayer and most probably is folded back into the protein. These data are consistent with the crystal structure of annexin B12, which indicates that the side chain of thr143 projects inward to a location between the D and E helices (see “Discussion”). Previous studies provided a wealth of high-resolution data on soluble annexins but only limited and lower-resolution data on the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound form of the proteins (5Liemann S. Huber R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 516-521Google Scholar). The primary goal of this study was to determine the structural and dynamic changes that occur upon Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin B12 to the membrane surface. Toward this end, the mobility and accessibility parameters of a nitroxide scan of positions 134 through 163 of annexin B12 were measured while the protein was bound to phosphatidylserine-containing vesicles in the presence of Ca2+, and these data were compared with previously published values for these positions determined while the protein was in solution (13Isas J.M. Langen R. Haigler H.T. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1464-1473Google Scholar). These data indicate that the overall backbone fold for the scanned region in the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bound state is similar to the fold in solution as determined by EPR analysis but is totally inconsistent with the structure of the scanned region when the protein forms a transmembrane pore at low pH in the absence of Ca2+ (17Langen R. Isas J. Hubbell W. Haigler H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14060-14065Google Scholar, 18Isas J.M. Patel D.R. Jao C. Jayasinghe S. Cartailler J.P. Haigler H.T. Langen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30227-30234Google Scholar). However, it should be noted that the scanned region was not positioned in a region suitable to analyze the “hinge” motion proposed to occur when soluble annexins bind to bilayers in the presence of Ca2+ (23Voges D. Berendes R. Burger A. Demange P. Baumeister W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 199-213Google Scholar). Although the overall fold was similar after membrane binding, some structural changes were noted in: 1) the loop between the D and E helices, 2) the D helix, and 3) sites of quaternary contact in membrane-bound trimers. These changes and their implications with regard to the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent membrane binding of annexins are discussed below. This discussion is facilitated by referring to Fig. 5, which presents a structural model of the scanned region of annexin B12 based on x-ray crystallography. In constructing this figure, we also consider a published crystal structure of annexin A5 in complex with Ca2+, and glycerophosphoserine, an analogue of the polar head-group of phosphatidylserine (8Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Google Scholar). Based on this annexin A5 structure, we modeled Ca2+ (yellow) and PO4 (green and red) into annexin B12 in Fig. 5, right, which represents the membrane-bound form of the protein. The Ca2+ and PO4 provide orientation with regard to the location of the bilayer, which would be expected to be horizontal and below the protein in Fig. 5. In addition to presenting the static x-ray structure, the backbone in Fig. 5 is color-coded to represent the dynamic properties of the protein based on ΔHo–1 values presented in Fig. 3. By far the most striking effect of membrane interaction was the strong reduction of the dynamics in the D–E interhelical loop region. In solution (Fig. 5, left) this loop is very dynamic, but upon membrane interaction, it becomes highly structured and immobilized (Fig. 5, right). Based on differences in O2 and NiEDDA accessibilities (Fig. 4, bottom), it is clear that 142R1, 144R1, and 145R1 insert into a hydrophobic region of the bilayer, whereas 143R1 (also located in the loop) projects toward the core of the protein as expected from the crystal structure (Fig. 5). Thus, this study establishes a direct interaction between the membrane and the D–E loop and provides the first direct data that the D–E loop of any annexin participates in Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. It is also intriguing that this loop is highly flexible in solution, yet it is likely to have a similar rigid structure in both the crystal and membrane-bound forms. In the annexin B12 x-ray crystal structure, this loop is involved in multiple interactions with neighboring protein molecules and has relatively low thermal factors (7Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Google Scholar). It seems that these interactions in the crystal “freeze out” the same conformation that this dynamic loop adopts when it interacts with the membrane. In addition to the strong reduction in the dynamics of the interhelical loop region, we also observed significant changes in the overall mobility at most sites in helix D (Figs. 2 and 3). This effect is weak in the N-terminal region of the helix but very pronounced in the C-terminal region, which is the membrane-proximal region of helix D (Fig. 5). These data suggest that the immobilization of the membrane binding loop is at least one of the factors that constrain the motion of helix D. In contrast to helix D, much more subtle changes were observed in helix E (Fig. 5). Here, EPR spectral changes were largely confined to sites located on the outside surface. Upon membrane interaction, these sites exhibit a somewhat reduced mobility (Figs. 2 and 3). We interpret this Ca2+ and membrane-dependent mobility change to be the consequence of quaternary contacts made upon trimer formation (Fig. 1, bottom). The interaction of annexin B12 with bilayers is a highly cooperative process that clearly involves multiple interactions with perhaps as many as 12 Ca2+ ions per annexin B12 monomer (or up to 36 per trimer), each of which is individually of low affinity (24Patel D.R. Jao C.C. Mailliard W. Isas J. Langen R. Haigler H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7054-7060Google Scholar). Each Ca2+ ion is likely to be coordinated by the phosphoryl oxygen from bilayer phospholipid and thus form a “Ca2+ bridge” between annexins and the bilayers (8Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Google Scholar). We have previously noted that the spacing between the Ca2+ binding sites and the phospholipid head group regions seems to be complementary (24Patel D.R. Jao C.C. Mailliard W. Isas J. Langen R. Haigler H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7054-7060Google Scholar). One might therefore expect that the complementary spacing of the head groups in bilayers may be essential for protein-lipid interaction. In support of this idea, we saw no changes in mobility of 144R1 when it was incubated in solution with high concentrations of Ca2+ (25 mm) and glycerophosphoserine (50 mm), an analogue of the polar head group of phosphatidylserine (data not shown), even though 144R1 was strongly mobilized by Ca2+-dependent interaction with bilayers (Fig. 2 and 3). Thus, the physical state of phospholipid membranes clearly plays a critical role in annexin B12 binding. It should also be pointed out that, based on the crystal structure, the carboxylate of glu142 provides one of the ligands for a type II Ca2+ site in the second repeat of annexin B12 (7Luecke H. Chang B.T. Mailliard W.S. Schlaepfer D.D. Haigler H.T. Nature. 1995; 378: 512-515Google Scholar). Thus, replacement of the native Glu side chain with a nitroxide could reduce the affinity of this Ca2+ binding site or possibly disrupt it. Nonetheless, 142R1 still underwent significant immobilization upon membrane binding (Fig. 2). Considering the large number of Ca2+ bound per annexin molecule, it is possible that other sites of annexin B12 were sufficient to cause local immobilization of lipid and protein even in the presence of the mutated type II site. Molecular motions in a phospholipid bilayer occur over a wide time range. For example, the trans-gauche isomerizations of the hydrocarbon chains occur on a time scale of 10–9–10–10 s, and, together with the axial diffusion of individual lipid molecules on a time scale about an order of magnitude slower, these motions give rise to liquid-like properties of the bilayer interior. These motions are on the order of the EPR time scale, and spin labels on the lipid chains near the bilayer center have high mobility (25Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Google Scholar). However, the head group region is more ordered and is characterized primarily by rotation of the lipid about the long axis (10–8–10–9), local fluctuations in the head group moiety, and lateral diffusion. Lateral diffusion can be characterized by the lifetime of a lipid at a particular position, before it exchanges with its neighbors. This is on the order of 10–7 s, very slow on the EPR time scale (26Devaux P. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 4475-4481Google Scholar). For a protein-bound spin label, such as 144R1 of annexin B12 located in the head group region of the bilayer, it is thus likely that axial rotational diffusion and local fluctuations will determine the nitroxide motion. These motions are sufficiently rapid to support an intermediate mobility of the nitroxide (correlation times of 1–10 ns). Indeed, R1 side chains on the surface of bacteriorhodopsin, facing the headgroups of the bilayer, have intermediate mobility (15Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2910Google Scholar) much higher than that observed for 144R1 on annexin B12 bound to bilayers. Relevant to the present work are SDSL studies of the Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid bilayers of the C2 domains of phospholipase A2 (27Malmberg N.J. Van Buskirk D.R. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13227-13240Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (28Kohout S.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1254-1265Google Scholar) to phospholipid bilayers. In these studies, R1 was placed at sites within the Ca2+-binding loops of these proteins, and some of these sites localized to the headgroup region of the bilayer in the bound state. At these sites in the C2 domains, the bilayer caused some decrease in mobility of the nitroxides, but the effects were minor compared with the bilayer-dependent immobilization of 144R1 in annexin B12. Thus, it is likely that the immobilization of 144R1 in annexin B12 after binding to bilayers is a result of interaction of the nitroxide with phospholipid head groups that are strongly immobilized by a type of protein-bilayer interaction that is unique to the annexins. This phenomenon is not specific to bilayers containing phosphatidylserine, because strong immobilization was also observed when phosphatidylserine was replaced with either phosphatidylglycerol or cardiolipin. 2J. M. Isas, R. Langen, W. L. Hubbell, and H. T. Haigler, unpublished results. These results further support the notion that the immobilization of 144R1 is not caused by any specific interaction of the R1 side chain with phosphatidylserine but rather is caused by overall restrictions in the lipid mobility. One would therefore expect that the native serine side chain at position 144 would experience immobilization similar to that observed for the nitroxide side chain at this position. It is possible that the unusual property of annexin-induced immobilization of bilayer headgroups could have implications for the biological function of this family of proteins. Several annexin gene products have been shown to cause pronounced effects on lipid dynamics after Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. FRAP experiments have shown that the lateral diffusion rates of phospholipids are reduced by several orders of magnitude by annexin A4 or A5 binding (29Gilmanshin R. Creutz C.E. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8225-8232Google Scholar, 30Saurel O. Cezanne L. Milon A. Tocanne J.F. Demange P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1403-1410Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies of spin-labeled lipids show that annexin A5 has found profound effects on the lipid fluidity gradient (31Megli F.M. Selvaggi M. Liemann S. Quagliariello E. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10540-10546Google Scholar, 32Megli F.M. Mattiazzi M. Di Tullio T. Quagliariello E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5534-5542Google Scholar), which is naturally present in phospholipid bilayers (25Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Google Scholar). It is interesting that strong reduction in mobility was observed in particular at lipid sites closest to the head group region (31Megli F.M. Selvaggi M. Liemann S. Quagliariello E. Huber R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10540-10546Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that the overall motion of both the lipid head group and the lipid binding sites in the protein are reduced significantly upon Ca2+-dependent interaction. We are not aware of any other instance in which the interaction of a protein and membrane has been shown to cause strong immobilization in both the lipid head group and the protein. Ca2+-dependent binding of annexin B12 to bilayers is strongly exothermic, with an enthalpy of association of –75 kcal/mol protein (24Patel D.R. Jao C.C. Mailliard W. Isas J. Langen R. Haigler H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7054-7060Google Scholar), yet this interaction is fully reversible. The overall free energy of the interaction must be significantly reduced by the entropy loss because of reduced mobility of both protein and lipid. These observations raise the possibility that annexin-induced immobilization of phospholipids could have physiologically significant effects on the mobility of other proteins in biological membranes. In support of this idea, recent studies have shown that the diffusion coefficient of the ryanodine receptor is reduced to near zero in planar bilayers in the presence of 1 μm annexin B12 (33Peng S. Publicover N.G. Airey J.A. Hall J.E. Haigler H.T. Jiang D. Chen S.R. Sutko J.L. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 145-151Google Scholar)."
