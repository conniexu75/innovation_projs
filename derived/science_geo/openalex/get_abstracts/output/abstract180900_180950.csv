https://openalex.org/W2035423713,"Feathers are highly ordered, hierarchical branched structures that confer birds with the ability of flight. Discoveries of fossilized dinosaurs in China bearing 'feather-like' structures have prompted interest in the origin and evolution of feathers. However, there is uncertainty about whether the irregularly branched integumentary fibres on dinosaurs such as Sinornithosaurus are truly feathers, and whether an integumentary appendage with a major central shaft and notched edges is a non-avian feather or a proto-feather. Here, we use a developmental approach to analyse molecular mechanisms in feather-branching morphogenesis. We have used the replication-competent avian sarcoma retrovirus to deliver exogenous genes to regenerating flight feather follicles of chickens. We show that the antagonistic balance between noggin and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) has a critical role in feather branching, with BMP4 promoting rachis formation and barb fusion, and noggin enhancing rachis and barb branching. Furthermore, we show that sonic hedgehog (Shh) is essential for inducing apoptosis of the marginal plate epithelia, which results in spaces between barbs. Our analyses identify the molecular pathways underlying the topological transformation of feathers from cylindrical epithelia to the hierarchical branched structures, and provide insights on the possible developmental mechanisms in the evolution of feather forms."

The purpose of this investigation was to gain further insights into the characteristics of proteins in whole saliva and in vivo formed pellicle components. To maximize separation and resolution using only micro-amounts of protein, a two-dimensional gel electrophoresis system was employed. Protein samples from parotid secretion, submandibular/sublingual secretion, whole saliva, and pellicle were subjected to isoelectric focusing followed by SDS-PAGE. Selected protein spots were excised, subjected to “in-gel” trypsin digestion, and examined by mass spectrometry (MS). The data generated, including peptide maps and tandem MS spectra, were analyzed using protein data base searches. Components identified in whole saliva include cystatins (SA-III, SA, and SN), statherin, albumin, amylase, and calgranulin A. Components identified in pellicle included histatins, lysozyme, statherin, cytokeratins, and calgranulin B. The results showed that whole saliva and pellicle have more complex protein patterns than those of glandular secretions. There are some similarities and also distinct differences between the patterns of proteins present in whole saliva and pellicle. MS approaches allowed identification of not only well characterized salivary proteins but also novel proteins not previously identified in pellicle.

However, detailed understanding of the protein composition in WS is still limited because of the lack of knowledge about proteins in other contributors to whole saliva such as secretions from minor salivary glands and gingival crevicular fluid. In addition, little is known about modifications that occur on proteins during or after secretion into the oral cavity. The acquired enamel pellicle (EP) is a protein film thought to result from the selective adsorption of precursor proteins present in WS onto tooth surfaces. Because of its intimate contact with enamel surfaces, the EP plays an important role in maintaining tooth integrity by controlling the mineral solution dynamics of enamel. At its interface with the oral environment, the EP exerts selectivity on bacterial attachment and is involved in the initial stages of plaque formation (14Hay Lazzari E.P. Handbook of Experimental Aspects of Oral Biochemistry. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1983: 44-67Google Scholar). Because of the limiting amount of proteins that can be harvested from EP formed in vivo, previous investigations have utilized sensitive but indirect approaches such as enzymatic assays and immunologic detection to identify EP components (15Orstavik D. Kraus F.W. Scand. J. Dent. Res. 1974; 82: 202-205PubMed Google Scholar, 16Al-Hashimi I. Levine M.J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1989; 34: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 17Carlen A.

Oral Sci. 2001; 109: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of the ways for direct identification of EP components is mass spectrometry (MS). MS has undergone considerable advances in the sensitive and specific analysis of biological materials (20Jonsson A.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 868-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The development of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS by Hillenkamp and colleagues (21Spengler B. Karas M. Bahr U. Hillenkamp F. J. Phys. Chem. 1987; 91: 6502-6506Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22Karas M. Hillenkamp F. Anal. Chem. 1988; 60: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar) greatly increased the ability to analyze non-volatile biomolecules. Since then, improvements in MALDI-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometers and sample handling methodologies have allowed very high throughput, primarily as a result of the speed of data acquisition and greater tolerance of contaminants (e.g. salts and detergents) by MALDI when compared with other MS methods (23Chaurand P. Luetzenkirchen F. Spengler B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 10: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The introduction of quadrupole orthogonal time-of-flight (QoTOF) MS has provided yet another level of sophisticated analysis (24Morris H.R. Paxton T. Dell A. Langhorne J. Berg M. Bordoli R.S. Hoyes J. Bateman R.H. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 25Shevchenko A. Chernushevich I. Ens W. Standing K.G. Thomson B. Wilm M. Mann M. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 11: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The coupling of quadrupoles to the TOF analyzer initially generated electrospray ionization (ESI) data with high sensitivity (<10 fmol) and mass accuracy (<20 ppm) and allowed for tandem experiments that give much more complete and reliable data to facilitate protein identification and characterization (26Guilhaus M. Selby D. Mlynski V. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2000; 19: 65-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The more recent addition of a MALDI source to the QoTOF mass spectrometer gave these instruments additional flexibility (27Shevchenko A. Loboda A. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2132-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). These advances in MS have been employed in a variety of biological investigations including cataloguing bacterial proteomes (28Jungblut P. Thiede B. Zimny-Arndt U. Muller E.C. Scheler C.

Recently, our group carried out the first direct identification of proteins found in EP formed in vivo using a MS approach with samples separated on one-dimensional SDS gels (34Yao Y. Grogan J. Zehnder M. Lendenmann U. Nam B. Wu Z. Costello C.E. Oppenheim F.G. Arch. Oral Biol. 2001; 46: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We have now addressed complications that arise from the presence of multiple components in an apparent single electrophoretic band by achieving better resolution of the protein mixture through the use of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE). Application of 2-DE has only been reported in a few investigations on proteins in WS (35Marshall T. Williams K.M. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 36Beeley J.A. Khoo K.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 1652-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 37Kojima T. Andersen E. Sanchez J.C. Wilkins M.R. Hochstrasser D.F. Pralong W.F. Cimasoni G. J. Dent. Res. 2000; 79: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and none so far on proteins found in in vivo formed EP. In none of these EP studies were proteins identified using MS techniques. In the present study, we used 2-DE to resolve and compare proteins from glandular secretions, WS, and EP and identified selected components from WS and EP using mass spectrometry. Healthy non-medicated male and female volunteers, ranging in age from 20 to 60 years, were selected. The subjects exhibited no overt signs of gingivitis or caries. Saliva and pellicle collection protocols were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Boston University Medical Center, and informed consent was obtained from each subject. Parotid secretion (PS) from both glands was collected by means of a Carlson-Crittenden device (38Carlson A.J. Crittenden A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1910; 26: 169-177Crossref Google Scholar). Submandibular/sublingual secretion (SMSL) was collected using a custom-fitted device consisting of a plastic core covered with Impregum F Impression material (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). The flow of glandular secretion was provoked by gustatory stimulation using sugar-free lemon-flavored candies. Collection of WS was carried out under masticatory stimulation using a uniform bolus of ParafilmTM (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The samples were kept on ice during the collection procedure. Immediately after the collection, WS samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C to remove undissolved materials. Samples of glandular secretions and WS supernatant collected from two subjects were pooled and stored in 200-μl aliquots at −20 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using a micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce). The collection procedure for thein vivo EP was carried out as described (34Yao Y. Grogan J. Zehnder M. Lendenmann U. Nam B. Wu Z. Costello C.E. Oppenheim F.G. Arch. Oral Biol. 2001; 46: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, each donor was subjected to a thorough dental prophylaxis employing a coarse pumice containing no additives. EP was then allowed to form on the enamel surfaces over a 2-h period. Teeth in each quadrant were isolated with cotton rolls, rinsed twice with water, and dried with air. A Durapore PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) soaked in 0.5m sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.0, was held with a pair of cotton pliers and used to swab the coronal two thirds of the labial/buccal surfaces spanning from the central incisor to the first molar. One PVDF membrane was used for the collection of pellicle in each quadrant. The resulting four membranes from one subject were placed into a polypropylene microcentrifuge tube. To recover pellicle proteins from PVDF membranes, 1 ml of distilled water was added to each tube and extraction of pellicle was carried out by vortexing the sample for 30 s followed by sonication (Branson Cleaning Equipment Co., Shelton, CT) for 5 min in an ice bath at 4 °C. Control experiments using two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) showed that sonication of PS under these conditions provoked undetectable fragmentation of proteins/peptides. To separate the extraction liquid from the membrane, a small needle-size (16-gauge) hole was placed on the bottom of the tube followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and the pellicle extract was collected into a separate tube. Pellicle samples were then desalted using sequential dilution-centrifugation steps in an Amicon microcentrifuge device (Millipore) with a molecular mass cut-off of 3000 Da. Desalted pellicle samples were then analyzed using a micro-BCA protein assay to determine protein concentration. 2-DE (28Jungblut P. Thiede B. Zimny-Arndt U. Muller E.C. Scheler C. Wittmann-Liebold B. Otto A. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39Wilkins M.R. Pasquali C. Appel R.D. Ou K. Golaz O. Sanchez J.C. Yan J.X. Gooley A.A.

Biol. 1997; 186: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was carried out by isoelectric focusing (IEF) using pre-made immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips on the Protean IEF cell (Bio-Rad) followed by SDS-PAGE using the Protean-II device (Bio-Rad). Approximately 50 μl of PS, SMSL, WS, or pooled EP samples containing 100 μg of proteins was mixed with 300 μl of IEF rehydration buffer in a focusing tray upon which a 17-cm-long, pre-made IPG strip was added. Rehydration was carried out in the tray under a constant voltage of 50 V for 12 h. The voltage was then gradually increased to 10,000 V, and samples were focused for an additional 6 h. To prepare the IPG strip for the second dimension, the strip was first equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 6 m urea with 1% dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by a second equilibration for 10 min using the same buffer except that dithiothreitol was replaced by 4% iodoacetamide (Sigma). Subsequently, the IPG strip was applied horizontally on top of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 × 20 cm), and proteins/peptides were separated vertically for 16 h at a constant voltage of 105 V. The resulting two-dimensional gel was stained either with silver (Owl Separation System, Portsmouth, NH) or with Sypro-Ruby (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Gels with the Sypro-Ruby staining were visualized under ultraviolet light using a Gel-Doc 1000 Imager (Bio-Rad). Protein spots were excised from two-dimensional gels using a sterile, cut pipette tip. Proteins contained in the gel were digested with sequencing-grade trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) as previously described (41Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 513-530PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides were extracted from gel pieces with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile and dried using a Speed-VacTM (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY). The resulting samples were resuspended in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted using ZiptipsC-18TM (Millipore) as per the instructions from the manufacturer. Samples were then dried and resuspended in 50% methanol with 1% formic acid and were analyzed using both the Finnigan MAT Vision 2000 MALDI-TOF reflectron mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with an ultraviolet laser (nitrogen, 337 nm) and the Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex QStar Pulsari quadrupole/orthogonal acceleration TOF mass spectrometer (QoTOF) with nanospray and MALDI (UV laser; nitrogen, 337 nm) sources (Applied Biosystems Inc., Framingham, MA). The MALDI-TOF MS was used initially to both screen samples to ensure adequate digestion and peptide recovery and to analyze samples at higher mass ranges. The QoTOF was then used to obtain data with high mass accuracy as well as to obtain tandem MS data. The MALDI matrix was 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), and typically 50–200 laser shots were summed for each spectrum. The laser power used was between 50 and 60% when obtaining the Vision spectra and 30–33 μJ when obtaining the QoTOF spectra. When obtaining QoTOF nanospray data, 1-μm nanospray tips, pulled with a Sutter model P-87 micropipette puller, were used with an ion source voltage of 1000–1300 V. For tandem data, nitrogen was used as the collision gas and a range of operator-controlled collision voltages (12–50 V for electrospray; 35–90 V for MALDI) were employed. Spectra were analyzed systematically by manually reconstructing mass data with tabulation of peaks having an area of 1.0% or greater relative to the largest peak. Peaks corresponding to trypsin autolysis peptides were not included. Mass lists were used to screen against tryptic fragment libraries including Mascot (Matrix Sciences Ltd.; www.matrixscience.com), PROWL (Rockefeller University and New York Universities; www.prowl.rockefeller.com), Protein Prospector (University of California at San Francisco; www.prospector.ucsf.edu), PepSea (Protana; 195.41.108.38) and PeptideSearch (EMBL; www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de) to identify salivary and pellicle components. Instruments were externally calibrated, and identification of fragment mass matches used an error of 0.1% for data obtained using the Vision 2000 MALDI-TOF MS and 50 ppm for data obtained using the QoTOF. In samples with appropriate signal (>10 counts), tandem MS data was obtained with the QoTOF and resultant fragmentation data were screened using the PepSea and Mascot data bases. The validity of protein matches was confirmed by either additional tandem data or a careful examination of all MS data available for that particular sample, and total coverage for each result was calculated. EP formed in vivo from a pooled sample derived from 20 subjects (100 μg) showed a characteristic 2-DE pattern using a focusing range of pH 3–10 (Fig. 1,panel A). Visual inspection of the gel revealed that most of the proteins/peptides were distributed into three zones dictated by molecular mass. The high molecular mass region I, spanning between 36 and 97 kDa, contained many detectable spots clustered together, which primarily focused between pI 5 and 6. The middle molecular mass region II, ranging between 21 and 36 kDa, again showed clustering of many spots focused between pI 5 and 7. The low molecular mass region III, covering the area below 21 kDa, contained many spots focusing in the range of pI 4–8. It is interesting to note that pI ranges for the major spots in the three zones expand as their molecular masses decrease. A 2-DE gel of proteins from a WS pool prepared using the same electrophoretic conditions revealed a different pattern from that of EP (Fig. 1, panel B). Although proteins were also mainly distributed into zones I–III in the vertical dimension, they were focused horizontally into wider pI ranges in zone I and II with major spots shifted to a more basic pI region than was observed with EP. To our knowledge, this is the first time that well resolved EP and WS samples are shown in 2-DE gels with a full view (pI range 3–10 and molecular mass range 0–200 kDa). However, the relatively similar pI values among some components in both biological samples clearly pointed to the necessity of further resolving these proteins/peptides. Because most of the major components were contained in the pI 5–8 range, narrow range IPG strips (pH 5–8) were subsequently applied in the IEF phase of the 2-DE. The pattern of spots visualized by 2-DE of proteins in WS and EP (Fig. 1) was next compared with those in PS and SMSL because the latter secretions are thought to contain primarily intact proteins which can serve as precursors to those in WS and the EP. The electrophoretogram of protein (100 μg) from pooled PS showed a profile of proteins with well defined separation (Fig. 2,panel A). Using the same zoning criteria, zone I contained ∼30 detectable spots, which largely focused between pI 6 and 7. Zone II consisted of at least 10 distinguishable spots, which were focused between pI 5 and 6. Zone III was divided mainly into two regions. The acidic region contained 3 heavily stained spots between pI 5 and 5.5 and several spots that migrated below pI 5. The basic region (pI higher than 7) contained ∼12 spots that were clearly discernible. A similar, but not identical, electrophoretic pattern was observed with SMSL (Fig. 2, panel B). The differences are likely caused by the presence of some proteins in SMSL such as mucins and cystatins, which are absent in PS. The tailing effect in the region above zone I (Fig. 2, panel B) may be caused by migration of MUC-7 glycoforms (42Liu B. Rayment S. Oppenheim F.G. Troxler R.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Additional spots seen in the basic region of zone III (Fig. 2, panel B) likely represent cystatin molecules. Although the data in Fig. 2 were obtained using pooled samples from two subjects, very similar electrophoretic patterns were obtained with samples from several other subjects. Given the relatively simple electrophoretograms from both PS and SMSL, one may imagine that WS, representing mostly a mixture of glandular secretions with only minor contributions from gingival crevicular fluid, would show an electrophoretic pattern that would nearly be a summation of the two protein patterns (Fig. 2, A andB). Therefore, it was surprising to find that there were significant differences between the protein patterns observed for glandular secretions (Fig. 2, A and B) and WS (Fig. 3) in the pI range 5–8. First, the number of detectable protein spots in WS was dramatically greater than those in either PS (Fig. 2A) or SMSL (Fig. 2 B). There were approximately 65 spots in zone I, 43 spots in zone II, and 30 in zone III. Second, proteins/peptides in WS seemed to be more distributed evenly throughout the pH range 5–8, in contrast to the clustering of spots in specific pH ranges that was observed in glandular secretions. Some proteins in glandular secretions such as the 5-protein spot series in the 40–45-kDa region (zone I, indicated by * in Fig. 2,A and B) were absent in WS, whereas more proteins/peptides were detectable in zone II of WS. These observations lend support to the finding that WS represents a mixture of proteins not only derived from different sources but, more importantly, proteins that have undergone significant processing and modification upon entering the oral cavity. EP was also analyzed using the narrow focusing range pH 5–8 (Fig. 4). A more refined pattern of spots was observed when EP was separated by this range in comparison to that shown in Fig. 1. This is particularly pronounced in the high (zone I) and middle (zone II) molecular mass zones because of greater resolution of the proteins/peptides separated in a narrower pH range exhibiting very close pI values. When components had greater pI variance, adequate separation could be obtained in both pH ranges as seen in zone III of Figs. 1 and 4. More than 40 spots were observed in each of the three zones, showing an overall distribution pattern that was essentially the same as that observed with the broad pH range gels (Fig. 1). The majority of the spots in zone I (Fig. 4) were focused between pI values of 5 and 6. This range expanded to pI 5–7 for zone II and to 5–8 for zone III. Spots with high staining intensity appeared in the same location for both gels and represent proteins/peptides of relatively high abundance. Despite of the fact that the EP analyzed over the pH range 3–10 was derived from a pool of pellicle proteins obtained from different subjects than the EP analyzed over pH range 5–8, there are considerable similarities in the overall EP patterns. These similarities point toward a consistency in EP composition and suggest that the generation of its constituents is dictated by a common mechanism. The difference between the electrophoretic patterns of EP and WS (Fig. 1, panels A and B) became more obvious when these proteins were separated in the focusing range of pH 5–8 (Figs. 3 and 4). In zone I, few of the spots observed in the pI range of 5–6 in EP were observed in WS, whereas the staining intensity for the protein series between pI 6 and 7 was significantly reduced in EP compared with WS. In zone II, very few of the spots observed in EP seemed to relate to those in WS. Although a few EP proteins in zone III were comparable with those in WS with respect to spot location, they varied in staining intensity. To identify specific protein/peptide components in EP and WS, MS methods were employed. Selected protein spots from WS and EP 2-DE gels were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion (43Jensen O.N. Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 571-588PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed using a MALDI-TOF and ESI- and MALDI-QoTOF mass spectrometers. Data were acquired with several types of mass spectrometers to ensure more complete coverage of identified spots. Analyzed protein spots are labeled numerically in Figs. 1, 3, and 4(S for WS and P for EP). Results for individual proteins identified are summarized in Table I. In general, the experimentally observed pI values were in good agreement with values reported in protein data bases. Exceptions are lysozyme, histatin 3, and calgranulin B. The discrepancy could be related in part to covalent modifications occurring during the EP formation and in part to steric influences and structural/conformational contributions. Details with respect to matching peptide masses as well as observed modifications (oxidation, pyroglutamination, phosphorylation, and alkylation) for each protein are given in Table II.Table IAssignment of gel components from whole saliva and in vivo pellicleSpot no.Protein assignedProtein Information Resource data base codeObserved (gel)TheoreticalSequence coverage (MS)MasspIMasspIDaDa%S1Cystatin SAP0922814,0004.614,3814.6774S2Cystatin SA-IIIUDHUP 114,0004.514,2714.7643S3StatherinSBHUP60004.053804.2230S4Cystatin SNUDHUP 217,0007.6413,2887.8481S6Calgranulin ABCHUCF10,0007.4410,8346.5168S8Cystatin SNUDHUP 215,0006.9913,2887.8434S13AmylaseALHUS56,0006.9755,9386.3448S14AmylaseALHUS56,0006.3255,9386.3448S15AmylaseALHUS56,0006.2555,9386.3448S16Serum albuminABHUS66,0006.3466,4335.9017P1LysozymeLZHU14,0007.9314,7009.2862P2Histatin 3B3254160007.8406210.084P3Histatin 1A3254160007.249287.0071P6StatherinSBHUP60004.053804.2225P11Cytokeratin 13P"

In this study, we investigated the role of VEGF/VPF in breast cancer metastasis to the brain. Very little is known about the role of endothelial integrity in the extravasation of breast cancer cells to the brain. We hypothesized that VEGF/VPF, having potent vascular permeability activity, may support tumor cell penetration across blood vessels by inducing vascular leakage. To examine this role of VEGF/VPF, we used a Transwell culture system of the human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) monolayer as an in vitro model for the blood vessels. We observed that VEGF/VPF significantly increased the penetration of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells across the HBMEC monolayer. We found that the increased transendothelial migration (TM) of MDA-MB-231 cells resulted from the increased adhesion of tumor cells onto the HBMEC monolayer. These effects (TM and adhesion of tumor cells) were inhibited by the pre-treatment of the HBMEC monolayer with the VEGF/VPF receptor (KDR/Flk-1) inhibitor, SU-1498, and the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl)ester. These treatments of the HBMEC monolayer also inhibited VEGF/VPF-induced permeability and the cytoskeletal rearrangement of the monolayer. These data suggest that VEGF/VPF can modulate the TM of tumor cells by regulating the integrity of the HBMEC monolayer. Taken together, these findings indicate that VEGF/VPF might contribute to breast cancer metastasis by enhancing the TM of tumor cells through the down-regulation of endothelial integrity.

Brain metastasis, which is an important cause of cancer morbidity and mortality, occurs in at least 30% of patients with breast cancer. A key event of brain metastasis is the migration of cancer cells through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), 1The abbreviations used are: BBB, blood-brain barrier; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HBMEC, human brain microvascular endothelial cell; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; MEK, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; TM, transendothelial migration; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; VPF, vascular permeability factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; VEGF-Ad, adenovirus-encoding VEGF/VPF; CTL-Ad, control adenovirus; SEB, sub-endothelial basement; DiI, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarboxyanine perchlorate; BCEGF-AM, 2,7′-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5(6′)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethylester; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (acetoxymethyl)ester which constitutes the endothelium and the surrounding cells (1Orr F.W.

Yun Z. Nakajima M. Marchetti D. Oncogenesis. 1994; 5: 451-471Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To metastasize to the brain, malignant tumor cells must enter into the circulatory system through the endothelium (intravasation) and then attach to microvessel endothelial cells to invade the BBB (extravasation) (1Orr F.W. Wang H.H. Lafrenie R.M. Scherbarth S. Nance D.M. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 310-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanism of extravasation of tumor cells penetrating the BBB is poorly defined. A widely supported hypothesis is that tumor cell adhesion to endothelium induces the retraction of endothelial cells, which exposes their basement membrane to the tumor cells (3Nicolson G.L. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1988; 7: 143-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Tumor cells recognize and bind to components in the vascular membrane, thereby initiating extravasation and the beginning of new growth at secondary organ sites (4Akiyama S.K. Olden K. Yamada K.M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This suggests that the intact endothelium can serve as a “defensive barrier” to the extravasation of tumor cells. Tumor-bearing blood vessels, however, do not seem to be effective in acting as a defensive barrier for the prevention of tumor cell intravasation, because these blood vessels display high leakage and disrupted integrity (5Thurston G.

Hypoxia is believed to contribute to the leakage of tumor blood vessels by inducing increased vascular permeability (7Olesen S.P.

Hypoxia is also a strong inducer of VEGF/VPF (9Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19761-19766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar,10Gleadle J.M. Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1362-C1368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF/VPF has potent mitotic activity specific to vascular endothelial cells and significant vascular permeable activity (11Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar, 12Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF/VPF binds to its cognate receptors, Flt-1, KDR/Flk-1, and neuropilin-1. Among them, KDR/Flk-1 is responsible for the initiation of signal transduction pathways within the cells (11Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar, 12Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). VEGF/VPF has an essential role in promoting new blood vessel formation (angiogenesis) during tumor development, and inhibition of its function effectively prevents tumor growth through incomplete blood vessel formation (13Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar, 14Brekken R.A. Overholser J.P. Stastny V.A. Waltenberger J. Minna J.D. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5117-5124PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, VEGF/VPF expression has been reported in a number of cancer cell lines and in several clinical specimens derived from breast, brain, and ovarian cancers (15Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Feder J. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brown L.F. Berse B. Jackman R.W. Tognazzi K. Guidi A.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Connolly J.L. Schnitt S.J. Hum.

Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Although the role of VEGF/VPF as an angiogenic factor in primary tumor growth and secondary tumor growth (metastatic tumors) is well studied, its role as a vascular permeability factor in metastatic processes is not well elucidated. Tumor cells may more easily penetrate a retracted endothelial monolayer caused by VEGF/VPF than a tightly arranged monolayer, suggesting that the vascular permeability activity of VEGF/VPF contributes an “offensive ability” to the tumor cells, allowing them to penetrate blood vessels. To examine this hypothesis, we constructed a Transwell culture system of the human brain endothelial monolayer as an in vitro model for the BBB. We then evaluated the inter-relationship between the integrity of the endothelial monolayer and the vascular permeability of VEGF/VPF and their effect on the TM of the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, which are known to express high amounts of VEGF/VPF (19Bachelder R.E. Crago A. Chung J. Wendt M.A. Shaw L.M. Robinson G. Mercurio A.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5736-5740PubMed Google Scholar). Human recombinant VEGF165/VPF (VEGF165 consists of 165 amino acid residues) and anti-human VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody were obtained from Genentech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Human recombinant bFGF was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Rhodamine-phalloidin, DiI, and BCECF-AM were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR), and PD98059, BAPTA-AM, Wortmannin, and SU-1498 were purchased fromCalbiochem. Anti-human VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Anti-human VEGF/VPF polyclonal antibody and anti-human Csk antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (San Diego, CA). Human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) were purchased from Cell Systems Inc. (Kirkland, WA). The cells were seeded onto attachment factor-coated culture plates and maintained in CSC complete medium according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The HBMECs formed tubular-like networks on matrigel and produced the endothelial-specific marker, von Willebrand factor, indicating that these cells maintained the general properties of endothelial cells (20Lee T.H. Avraham H. Lee S.H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10445-10451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). During the course of the experiment, the cells were used until passages three to seven and checked routinely for expression of von Willebrand factor. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and were cultured in EGM complete medium (Clonetics). MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in culture medium (DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine). HBL-100 cells (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. T47D cells (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell lines were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. mRNAs of breast cancer cell lines were isolated from cellular extracts by using an oligo(dT) column (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mRNAs were separated on an agarose gel and transferred to a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was hybridized with a32P-labeled probe for KDR/Flk-1 (a generous gift of Dr. Michael Klagsbrun, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA), and after washing, the blot was exposed to x-ray film. The blot was also stripped and reprobed for actin mRNA. MDA-MB-231 cells were incubated with 200 nm DiI for 30 min and then washed twice with PBS. DiI-labeled cells were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended in culture medium. Alternatively, tumor cells were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and incubated with 1 μm BCECF-AM for 15 min and then centrifuged three times to remove free BCECF-AM. HBMECs grown on attachment factor-coated culture plates were dispersed in 0.05% trypsin solution and resuspended in CSC complete medium. Approximately 100,000 cells were added to the fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 8 μm (Costar Corp.) and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every day with fresh medium. Prior to the assays, the monolayers were washed once with CSC medium without growth factor and then 40,000 DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells in 100 μl of the same medium were added to the apical chamber. To exclude the chemoattractant effect of the added growth factor, VEGF/VPF or bFGF was added evenly to the apical and basolateral chambers. In the case of inhibitor treatment, the monolayers were pre-treated for 30 min, and all synthetic inhibitors were removed from the monolayers by washing twice with culture medium. After incubation for 6 h, the apical chambers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed extensively with PBS. To remove non-migrating cells, the apical side of the apical chamber was scraped gently with cotton wool, and only the migrating tumor cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope. Migrating cells were counted from 10 random fields of ×200 magnification. MDA-MB-231 cells were infected with adenovirus-encoding VEGF/VPF (VEGF-Ad; a generous gift of Dr. Harold Dvorak, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) or control adenovirus (CTL-Ad) at a multiplicity of infection of 1,000 for 48 h. After labeling with DiI, the cells were dispersed in trypsin solution and resuspended in CSC medium without growth factor. 5,000 DiI-labeled cells were treated with VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody and were then added to the apical chamber containing the HBMEC monolayer. After incubation for 18 h, the apical chambers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and the migrating tumor cells were observed according to the method described above. 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 8 μm (Costar Corp.) were coated by air drying with 50 ng of matrigel. MDA-MB-231 cells were trypsinized and suspended at 1.5 × 105 in 100 μl of DMEM containing 1% BSA. The cells were added to the apical chamber and then VEGF/VPF was added to the basolateral chamber containing 600 μl of DMEM with 1% BSA. After incubation for 6 h, the apical chambers were stained with HEMA-3 solution (Fisher), and the apical side of the apical chamber was scraped gently with cotton wool. The migrating tumor cells were observed under a light microscope and were counted from 10 random fields of ×200 magnification. HBMECs were added to attachment factor-coated 24-well culture plates and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every day with fresh medium. Prior to the assays, the monolayers were washed once with CSC medium without growth factor and then 100,000 of DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells in 500 μl of the same medium were added to each well with or without test samples. In the case of inhibitor treatment, the monolayers were pre-treated for 30 min, and all synthetic inhibitors were removed from the monolayers by washing twice with culture medium. After incubation for 2 h, the wells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed extensively with PBS to remove floating tumor cells. Attached tumor cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope and counted from 10 random fields of ×200 magnification. To detach the endothelial monolayer and prepare the sub-endothelial basement (SEB) membrane components, the monolayers were treated with 50 mm NH4OH solution for 5 min as indicated previously (21Gospodarowicz D. Massoglia S. Cheng J. Fujii D.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 127: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and washed extensively with PBS before adding the DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells. To monitor the extent of endothelial cell retraction, the amount of [3H]inulin (Amersham Biosciences) passing across an endothelial monolayer was measured as described (14Brekken R.A. Overholser J.P. Stastny V.A. Waltenberger J. Minna J.D. Thorpe P.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5117-5124PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼100,000 HBMECs were added to fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 0.4 μm (Falcon Corp.) and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was replaced every day with fresh medium. After the removal of culture medium, 0.4 ml of the fresh culture medium containing [3H]inulin (1 μCi) was added to the apical chamber. The basolateral chamber was filled with 0.6 ml of the same medium without [3H]inulin and then 30 ng/ml of VEGF/VPF were added to the apical and basolateral chambers. In the case of inhibitor treatment, the monolayers were pre-treated for 30 min before VEGF/VPF treatment. After incubation for 2 h, 30 μl of medium from the basolateral chamber was collected, and the amount of [3H]inulin across the monolayers was determined by scintillation counting. HBMECs were added to fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 0.4 μm and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After the assays, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Following a PBS washing, the cells were blocked with 20% goat serum in PBS and then incubated at room temperature with rhodamine-phalloidin (diluted 1:40) in PBS for 1 h. After washing by three changes of PBS, the polycarbonate membranes were separated carefully from the apical chamber and mounted on a slide, and F-actin staining was observed under a fluorescent microscope. HBMECs were added to fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 0.4 μm and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After the assays, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Alternatively, 1,000 BCECF-AM-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were added to each well with or without VEGF/VPF (30 ng/ml). After incubation for 2 h, the wells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, washed extensively with PBS to remove floating tumor cells, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. Following a PBS washing, the cells were blocked with 20% goat serum in PBS for 1 h before overnight incubation at 4 °C with anti-human VE-cadherin monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) diluted by calcium containing serum-free DMEM. After washing by three changes of PBS, the cells were incubated for 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG Texas-red (diluted 1:200) in PBS. After washing by three changes of PBS, the polycarbonate membranes were separated carefully from the apical chamber, mounted on a slide, and viewed under a confocal microscope. MDA-MB-231 cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (New England Biolabs). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Boston, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and subsequently incubated with primary antibody for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). It was reported that, in nearly 50% of breast tumors, there was significant expression of KDR/Flk-1 in the tumor epithelial cells, which correlated with the expression of VEGF/VPF by these cells (22De Jong J.S. van Diest P.J. van der Valk P. Baak J.P. J. Pathol. 1998; 184: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To examine whether various breast cancer cell lines express the VEGF/VPF receptor, KDR/Flk-1, which is responsible for most VEGF/VPF activity, we performed Northern blot analysis with a specific probe for KDR/Flk-1. As shown in Fig. 1 A, breast cancer cell lines, such as MDA-MB-231 cells, expressed KDR/Flk-1 mRNA at a low level as compared with HUVEC. Next, to test whether MDA-MB-231 cells respond to exogenously added VEGF/VPF, an invasion assay was performed for 6 h under serum-free conditions. MDA-MB-231 cells were added to a matrigel-coated polycarbonate filter and then invading cells were assessed under a light microscope. When VEGF/VPF was added to the basolateral chambers, the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells was not significantly increased, irrespective of KDR/Flk-1 expression (Fig. 1 B). To test whether VEGF/VPF increases tumor cell penetration, DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were added to an HBMEC monolayer cultured onto a Transwell apical chamber and then penetrating MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed under a fluorescent microscope. To exclude the chemoattractant effect of the added growth factor for the HBMEC monolayer or tumor cells, VEGF/VPF was added evenly to the apical and basolateral chambers. VEGF/VPF treatment led to a dose-dependent increase in the penetration of MDA-MB-231 cells across the HBMEC monolayer as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 2). bFGF is also known as a potent endothelial cell growth factor but does not increase vascular permeability (23Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). When bFGF was added evenly to the apical and basolateral chambers, it failed to significantly increase the TM of the cells. These data indicate the possibility that the increased TM of the MDA-MB-231 cells is because of the endothelial cell retraction induced by VEGF/VPF. To further characterize whether VEGF/VPF is related directly to the increased TM of MDA-MB-231 cells, the HBMEC monolayer was treated with VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody (20 μg/ml) and with SU-1498 (50 μm), an antagonist of KDR/Flk-1. As shown in Fig. 4, both treatments against VEGF/VPF significantly inhibited the TM of the MDA-MB-231 cells.Figure 4BAPTA/AM inhibits the TM of MDA-MB-231 cells across an HBMEC monolayer. HBMECs were added to fibronectin-coated 24-well Transculture inserts with pore sizes of 8 μm and grown for 5 days in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The monolayers were pre-treated for 30 min with the indicated synthetic inhibitors and washed twice with culture medium. 40,000 DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were added to the apical chamber. To exclude the chemoattractant effect of the added growth factor, VEGF/VPF was added evenly to the apical and basolateral chambers.

Gonzalez R. Nicolson G.L. Int. J. Cancer. 1980; 26: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The same phenomenon was observed in this study with MDA-MB-231 cells that attached preferentially to areas where the SEB of the endothelial cell was exposed (Fig. 3, right panel). Therefore, the increased TM of the MDA-MB-231 cells induced by VEGF/VPF might result from the increased adhesion of the cells to the SEB membrane components of the endothelial cells that were exposed. To test this possibility, DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells were added to an HBMEC monolayer cultured onto 24-well plates with or without VEGF/VPF, and cell adhesion was then assessed under a fluorescent microscope. At a concentration of 30 ng/ml, VEGF/VPF increased the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to the HBMEC monolayer 3-fold as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 3, left panel), and this effect was blocked by VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody and SU-1498 (see Fig. 5). However, bFGF failed to significantly increase the adhesion of tumor cells to the monolayer as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the increased TM of MDA-MB-231 cells induced by VEGF/VPF was at least in part derived from enhanced tumor cell adhesion onto the exposed SEB membrane components.Figure 5BAPTA/AM inhibits the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells onto the HBMEC monolayer.

The monolayers were pre-treated for 30 min with the indicated inhibitors, and all synthetic inhibitors except VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody were removed from the monolayers by washing twice with culture medium. 100,000 DiI-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells in 500 μl of the same medium were added to each well with or without VEGF/VPF. After incubation for 2 h, the monolayers were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and washed extensively with PBS to remove floating tumor cells. Attached tumor cells were observed by a fluorescent microscope and counted from 10 random fields of ×200 magnification. The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples.

Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3148) Google Scholar). To examine which signaling pathways of VEGF/VPF in endothelial cells are responsible for the increased TM and adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells, the effects of specific inhibitors for various VEGF/VPF signaling pathways were tested. As shown in Figs.4 and 5, the intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA-AM) slightly inhibited the increased TM and adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells stimulated by VEGF/VPF whereas the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor (Wortmannin) had no effect, indicating that VEGF/VPF increases the TM and adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells through activation of endothelial calcium signaling. Endothelial cell retraction induces the breakdown of intercellular junctions and leads to an increase in vascular permeability. Therefore, we measured the extent of endothelial cell retraction induced by VEGF/VPF as the degree of permeability change of [3H]inulin through the HBMEC monolayer. As expected, VEGF/VPF meaningfully increased the permeability of the monolayer as compared with the untreated control, and this effect was blocked by VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody and SU-1498 (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the increased vascular permeability caused by VEGF/VPF was abolished by BAPTA-AM but not by PD98059 and Wortmannin (Fig. 6), indicating that calcium signaling mediates the increased permeability induced by VEGF/VPF. We then assessed the mechanism that leads to increased endothelial cell permeability. One important regulatory mechanism for the integrity of endothelial cell junction maintenance is the distribution of actin to a cortical pattern, precluding stress fiber formation. As shown in Fig. 7 A, VEGF/VPF caused a marked redistribution of actin fibers that condensed toward the center of the cell, with resulting stress fiber formation. The actin condensation in the endothelial cells occurred within 15 min after VEGF/VPF treatment. Actin redistribution induced by VEGF/VPF was substantially reversed by co-incubation with VEGF/VPF monoclonal antibody and SU-1498 (data not shown). These data indicated that VEGF/VPF was responsible for the architectural change within the endothelial cell, leading to increased vascular permeability. Because we found that calcium signaling contributed to the increased permeability induced by VEGF/VPF, we assessed its contribution to the redistribution of actin. We found that BAPTA-AM potently blocked the effect of VEGF/VPF in stimulating actin redistribution (Fig. 7 A), suggesting a molecular mechanism for the role of calcium in modulating the permeability of the HBMEC monolayer. We also examined adherens junction protein alignment at the HBMEC monolayer (Fig. 7 B). The specific endothelial adherens junctional protein, VE-cadherin, has been shown to maintain and perhaps regulate endothelial barrier properties (25Dejana E. Bazzoni G. Lamp"
https://openalex.org/W2049976919,"Cyr61, a member of the CCN family of genes, is an angiogenic factor. We have shown that it is overexpressed in invasive and metastatic human breast cancer cells and tissues. Here, we investigated whether Cyr61 is necessary and/or sufficient to bypass the 'normal' estrogen (E2) requirements for breast cancer cell growth. Our results demonstrate that Cyr61 is sufficient to induce MCF-7 cells to grow in the absence of E2. Cyr61-transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/Cyr61) became E2-independent but still E2-responsive. On the other hand, MCF-7 cells transfected with the vector DNA (MCF-7/V) remain E2-dependent. MCF-7/Cyr61 cells acquire an antiestrogen-resistant phenotype, one of the most common clinical occurrences during breast cancer progression. MCF-7/Cyr61 cells are anchorage-independent and capable of forming Matrigel outgrowth patterns in the absence of E2. ER alpha expression in MCF-7/Cyr61 cells is decreased although still functional. Moreover, MCF-7/Cyr61 cells are tumorigenic in ovariectomized athymic nude mice. The tumors resemble human invasive carcinomas with increased vascularization and overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Our results demonstrate that Cyr61 is a tumor-promoting factor and a key regulator of breast cancer progression. This study provides evidence that Cyr61 is sufficient to induce E2-independence and antiestrogen-resistance, and to promote invasiveness in vitro, and to induce tumorigenesis in vivo, all of which are characteristics of an aggressive breast cancer phenotype."

The transcriptional activity of AR and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily are modulated by coregulatory proteins.

AR is also involved in the development and progression of prostate cancer, which is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in males. Indeed, somatic mutations of the AR gene have been found in prostate tumors, which may contribute to androgen-independent growth of the cancer cell (2Bentel J.M. Tilley W.D. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 151: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Treatment with antiandrogens can partially or completely arrest prostate cancer cell proliferation. Similar to other steroid receptors the unliganded AR is held in an inactive conformation by association with heat shock proteins in the cytoplasm. The heat shock protein complex assists in maintaining an AR conformation that is active to ligand binding. Upon ligand binding, the heat shock protein complex dissociates from the receptor (3Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Zegers N.D. van der Kwast T.H. Grootegoed J.A. Mulder E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7422-7430Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), allowing AR to homodimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where it recognizes and binds specific promoter elements to activate gene expression (4Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar).Like other members of the NR superfamily, AR contains an N-terminal AF-1 transactivation domain (or A/B domain), a centrally located DNA-binding domain (DBD or C domain), a hinge region (or D domain), and a ligand-binding domain (LBD or E domain). The E domain is also involved in receptor dimerization and contains ligand-dependent AF-2 function. The A/B domain is the most variable among NRs, and in the case of AR, it contains two separate transactivation domains that are required for full ligand-inducible transcription activity (5Simental J.A.

The A/B region also contains a polyglutamine tract whose expansion may influence AR transcription activity and cause infertility and Kennedy's disease (7La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B.

In addition, mutations in the AF-1 function have also been identified in patients suffering from androgen insensitivity or oligospermia (9Gottlieb B. Vasiliou D.M. Lumbroso R. Beitel L.K. Pinsky L.

Interestingly, the A/B domain has been also shown to interact directly with the E domain in a ligand-dependent manner (12Doesburg P. Kuil C.W. Berrevoets C.A. Steketee K. Faber P.W. Mulder E.

The silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT) and the related nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) were originally isolated as RAR- and TR-interacting proteins that form complexes with the unliganded receptors to facilitate transcriptional repression of gene expression (28Chen J.D.

In addition, SMRT and N-CoR have also been implicated as corepressors for a variety of unrelated transcription factors involved in a wide array of biological processes (27Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 689-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promiscuity of SMRT and N-CoR on interacting with multiple transcription factors is consistent with an essential role in embryonic development as was revealed by studies of N-CoR-null mice, which die in midgestation and exhibit defects in several developmental processes (39Jepsen K. Hermanson O. Onami T.M. Gleiberman A.S. Lunyak V. McEvilly R.J. Kurokawa R. Kumar V. Liu F. Seto E. Hedrick S.M. Mandel G. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Despite the established function of SMRT and N-CoR in regulating transcriptional repression activity of several NRs, the role SMRT and N-CoR in regulating AR transcriptional activity is less clear. Recently, it has been shown that AR can interact with N-CoR in HEK293 cells in the presence of DHT (40Fu M. Wang C. Wang J. Zhang X. Sakamaki T. Yeung Y.G. Chang C. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3373-3388Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this interaction is enhanced substantially by an acetylation site mutation at the hinge/D region of AR that affected transactivation function of AR without affecting its transrepression activity (40Fu M. Wang C. Wang J. Zhang X. Sakamaki T. Yeung Y.G. Chang C. Hopp T. Fuqua S.A. Jaffray E. Hay R.T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. Pestell R.G. Mol. Cell.

In this study, we demonstrate that the N-CoR-related corepressor SMRT interacts directly with both the unliganded and liganded AR in vivo andin vitro. We demonstrate that this interaction is mediated through the C-terminal NR-interaction domain (ID2) of SMRT. The minimal interacting surface on AR is mapped to the LBD/E domain, while the presence of DBD/hinge region of AR enhances this interaction substantially. We show that SMRT inhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by AR and further suppresses antiandrogen-mediated inhibition of AR activity. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that the mechanisms of SMRT-mediated inhibition of AR activity are through disruption of AR N/C interaction and/or competition with the p160 coactivators. These data establish a function role for the corepressor SMRT to regulate the transcriptional activity of AR.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have investigated the physical and functional interactions between AR and the corepressor SMRT. We show that SMRT interacts with both the unliganded and liganded forms of ARin vitro and in vivo. The AR-SMRT interactionin vivo appears to be enhanced by agonist or antagonist treatment. We have mapped the interaction surface to the SMRT-ID2 domain and showed that mutation of the ID2 corepressor motif disrupted the interaction. We found that the AR LBD/E domain is sufficient to bind SMRT, while the C/D domain also play a critical role in regulating SMRT binding. In addition, we demonstrate an in vivocolocalization between SMRT and AR in cultured mammalian cells. The biological significance of these in vivo and in vitro interactions between AR and SMRT is supported by transient transfection assay showing that overexpression of SMRT robotically inhibits AR-mediated transcriptional activation of target promoter. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that the mechanisms of SMRT-mediated inhibition on AR transcriptional activity may be due to either disruption of the AR N/C interaction and/or functional competition with the p160 coactivator.Using the Gal4 DBD fusion protein system, we show that AR contains transcriptional repression activity. We localized such repression activity to the E domain of the receptor (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with existing knowledge, we show that the AR A/B domain contains a strong transcriptional activation function, and that this activity is masked in the context of full-length AR. The ability of the G4-AR fusion protein to repress basal transcription is consistent with the interaction of AR with SMRT as first demonstrated by mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 C). We speculate that the inability of G4-AR A/B to repress transcription despite its interaction with SMRT is due to the presence of a strong AF-1 function. The in vivo interaction between AR and SMRT is further supported by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous AR and SMRT from the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell lysate (Fig. 1 D). Interestingly, we found that the AR ligands, especially the antagonist flutamide, appear to enhance the in vivo association of AR with SMRT. This result is consistent with a previous chromatin immunoprecipitation study showing that the AR antagonist bicalutamide could enhance the recruitment of N-CoR and SMRT to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter in LNCap prostate cancer cells (52Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).The physical interaction between AR and SMRT was demonstrated by GST pull-down assay, which indicates that SMRT may interact with AR directly in vitro. We have mapped the interacting surfaces on SMRT to the ID2 domain. Interestingly, the SMRT-ID1 domain has no affinity to AR, despite the fact that this domain is the primary interacting surface for RAR and TR (42Li H. Leo C. Schroen D.J. Chen J.D. Mol.

Our data suggest that there might be at least two SMRT binding sites on the AR protein, although the exact binding mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The best AR fragment for SMRT binding is the AR-(501–919) amino acid fragment that contains both the DBD/hinge region and LBD. Since the LBD alone binds to SMRT but DBD/hinge alone shows no interaction with SMRT, we speculate that there may be a SMRT binding site within the LBD. The fact that the AR-(501–919) fragment binds to SMRT much stronger that the AR-(661–919) fragment suggest a critical role for the DBD/hinge region of AR in regulating corepressor binding. It is possible that the presence of the DBD/hinge domain may help to stabilize a conformation of the LBD and A/B domain that is more compatible with SMRT binding. Alternatively, it is equally possible that there might be a weak binding site within the AR DBD or hinge region that may synergize with the other binding site for SMRT binding. Contrary to a recent report (53Dotzlaw H. Moehren U. Mink S. Cato A.C. Iniguez Lluhi J.A. Baniahmad A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found no interaction between AR A/B alone and SMRT in GST pull-down assays using either GST-cSMRT or SMRT-ID2. However, the interaction between SMRT and AR LBD is readily detectable in our assay. It appears that SMRT utilizes the ID2 corepressor motif for interaction with AR, suggesting that the mechanisms of SMRT binding to these two sites may be related. Since the amino acid sequences of the ID1 and ID2 corepressor motifs are similar, the mechanisms by which AR distinguishes one motif from the other remains to be determined.Unlike RAR and TR, whose interactions with SMRT are ligand-independent (28Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 42Li H. Leo C. Schroen D.J. Chen J.D. Mol.

A. 1996; 93: 7567-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), or the PR and ER whose interactions with SMRT are antagonist-dependent (30Jackson T.A. Richer J.K. Bain D.L. Takimoto G.S. Tung L.

Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we found that the interaction between full-length AR and SMRT is not affected by androgens in the in vitro binding assay (Fig. 2 D). These data suggest that SMRT might be able to interact with both the unliganded and liganded forms of AR. The ability of SMRT to interact with liganded AR is consistent with the reporter gene assay demonstrating that SMRT can inhibit ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by AR (Fig. 4). Alternatively, we have previously shown that there are a substantial number of cells containing cytoplasmic SMRT staining (55Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), implying that SMRT might be involved in the signal transduction pathway of AR in the cytoplasm during its ligand-induced transformation process. It is also possible that SMRT might help to maintain an inactive AR conformation in either the cytoplasm or nucleus.The subcellular distribution of unliganded AR is cell line-dependent as the AR is predominantly nuclear when expressed in HeLa cells but mainly cytoplasmic in COS-1 cells (56Jenster G. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In the presence of hormone, the AR is translocated into the nucleus and distributed in a microspeckles (57Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 58Saitoh M. Takayanagi R. Goto K. Fukamizu A. Tomura A. Yanase T. Nawata H. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28395-28401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Our data show that coexpression of AR and SMRT in HeLa cells results in apparent colocalization in the speckles (Fig. 3), thus confirming in vivo association of AR and SMRT. Interestingly, unlike the recruitment of RAR to the SMRT speckles (55Wu X. Li H. Park E.J. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24177-24185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), AR seems to disrupt the SMRT speckles as a majority of the transfected cells contain microspeckled SMRT staining when AR is coexpressed (Fig. 3). It is possible that AR may be able to recruit SMRT to its nuclear sites. Consistently, SMRT has been detected on the natural AR target promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay in the presence of antiandrogen (52Shang Y. Myers M. Brown M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 601-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Likely, when AR binds to the response element in the presence of antiandrogen, it is able to recruit SMRT to the target promoter because of lack of competition from coactivator. In contrast, in the presence of androgen, SMRT will have to compete with coactivator, and only when SMRT is overexpressed will it be able to show binding to the liganded receptor.Our data suggest that SMRT can inhibit both the AF-1 and AF-2 function of AR in a SMRT dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). This inhibition is likely due to direct binding of SMRT as demonstrated byin vivo and in vitro binding assays. We predict that SMRT binding to liganded AR may block recruitment of coactivators or bring in deacetylase activity to the liganded receptor. It is reasonable to speculate that binding of SMRT to the liganded receptor may be sufficient to block AR transcriptional activity. Interestingly, the inhibition of AR activity can be reverted by overexpression of the coactivator TIF2 (Fig. 6). Because TIF2 also binds to the liganded AR, it is conceivable that the reinstatement of AR activity by TIF2 may be due to displacement of SMRT from the liganded AR, resulting in subsequent recruitment of CBP/p300 or other coactivators to the receptor. The existence of a mutual competition between TIF2 and SMRT on regulating AR transactivation suggests that the corepressor SMRT might inhibit transactivation by the liganded receptor. Similarly, we also observed potent inhibition of AR activity by the SMRT-related corepressor N-CoR. 2G. Liao and J. D. Chen, unpublished data. Because SMRT and N-CoR share highly conserved NR interaction domains, we believe that both SMRT and N-CoR can function independently to negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of liganded AR.The AR has been shown to undergo several rounds of “recycling” before being subjected to proteasome-mediated degradation (57Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), indicating that a mechanism of transient AR inactivation must exist. It has been suggested that hormone inactivation or degradation may result in the transient deactivation of AR activity prior to receptor export from the nucleus (57Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent report indicates that HDAC1 may play a key role in the acute repression of AR transcriptional activity (60Gaughan L. Logan I.R. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25904-25913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We suggest here that SMRT may be another key player in the down-regulation of AR activity. The abilities of SMRT to interact with the liganded AR, to compete with TIF2 coactivator, and to block AR N/C interaction are all consistent with the hypothesis that SMRT is capable of antagonizing the transcriptional activity of AR. Interestingly, SMRT is known to form a stable complex with HDAC1 (61Nagy L. Kao H.Y. Chakravarti D. Lin R.J. Hassig C.A. Ayer D.E. Schreiber S.L. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar), implying that SMRT and HDAC1 may act synergistically to inhibit AR activity. However, our data also indicate that the primary mechanism for the SMRT-mediated AR inactivation may be due to the blockage of AR N/C interaction. This is supported by the fact that the C-terminal fragment of SMRT, which contains only the receptor-interacting domain but no transcriptional repression activity, is capable of blocking N/C interaction (Fig. 5). The molecular mechanisms by which SMRT blocks AR N/C interaction remain to be defined. However, in light of previous observations that SMRT can function as an activating cofactor for HDAC3 to acetylate histones (62Fischle W. Dequiedt F"
https://openalex.org/W1987952787,"The release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria into the cytosol is one of the critical events in apoptotic cell death. In the present study, it is shown that release of cytochrome c and apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) in HeLa cells can be inhibited by (i) overexpression of an oncoprotein Bcl-2, (ii) Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) or (iii) oligomycin, an inhibitor of H+- ATP-synthase. Staurosporine-induced apoptosis is sensitive to Bcl-2 but insensitive to Cyclosporin A and oligomycin. The effect of oligomycin is not due to changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or to inhibition of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis since (a) uncouplers (CCCP, DNP) which discharge the membrane potential fail to abolish the protective action of oligomycin and (b) aurovertin B (another inhibitor of H+-ATP-synthase, affecting its F1 component) do not affect apoptosis. A role of oligomycin-sensitive F0 component of H+-ATP-synthase in the TNF-induced PTP opening and apoptosis is suggested."

We hypothesized that the phosphate potential of β-cells regulates the sensitivity of leucine stimulation. These predictions were tested by measuring leucine-stimulated insulin secretion in perifused rat islets following glucose depletion and by tracing the nitrogen flux of [2-15N]glutamine using stable isotope techniques. The sensitivity of leucine stimulation was enhanced by long time (120-min) energy depletion and inhibited by glucose pretreatment. After limited 50-min glucose depletion, leucine, not α-ketoisocaproate, failed to stimulate insulin release. β-Cells sensitivity to leucine is therefore proposed to be a function of GDH activation. Leucine increased the flux through GDH 3-fold compared with controls while causing insulin release. High glucose inhibited flux through both glutaminase and GDH, and leucine was unable to override this inhibition. These results clearly show that leucine induced the secretion of insulin by augmenting glutaminolysis through activating glutaminase and GDH. Glucose regulates β-cell sensitivity to leucine by elevating the ratio of ATP and GTP to ADP and Pi and thereby decreasing the flux through GDH and glutaminase.

Leucine, which has been studied intensively, may stimulate insulin release through two different mechanisms. The first involves transamination of leucine to α-ketoisocaproate (KIC)1 and subsequent mitochondrial oxidation. The second promotes insulin release via allosteric activation of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) causing oxidation of glutamate to the Krebs cycle intermediate, α-ketoglutarate, plus ammonia. The importance of the latter mechanism has been highlighted recently by the discovery of a dominant form of congenital hyperinsulinism associated with mutations of GDH leading to a gain of enzyme activity, because sensitivity to inhibition by GTP and ATP is impaired (1Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H. Zammarchi E. Poncz M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 1352-1357Google Scholar, 2Stanley C.A. Fang J. Kutyna K. Hsu B.Y.

Affected children have increased β-cell responsiveness to leucine and are susceptible to acute hypoglycemia following a high protein meal (4Hsu B.Y. Kelly A. Thornton P.S. Greenberg C.R. Dilling L.A. Stanley C.A. J. Pediatr. 2001; 138: 383-389Google Scholar). The involvement of GDH may explain the observation that, in contrast to other amino acids, leucine-stimulated insulin secretion (LSIS) is suppressed by high glucose. For example, Gao et al. (5Gao Z.Y., Li, G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Google Scholar) reported that glucose inhibits leucine stimulation of glutaminolysis and insulin secretion in isolated mouse islets, presumably by increasing intracellular ATP and GTP while decreasing ADP and thus inhibiting GDH activity. GDH has also been proposed by Maechler and Wollheim (6Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Google Scholar) to play an essential role in glucose-mediated insulin secretion by acting in the reverse direction to catalyze production of glutamate, which is hypothesized to work as a cofactor in the process leading to exocytosis of insulin granules. These investigators have suggested that lower levels of GDH in mouse islets may explain the reduced second phase of insulin secretion of mouse islets compared with the predominant second phase insulin release observed in rat and human islets (7Maechler P. Gjinovci A. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51 Suppl. 1: S99-S102Google Scholar). Their suggestion that net flux through GDH is toward synthesis rather than oxidation of glutamate has been contradicted by other reports (8Yamada S. Komatsu M. Sato Y. Yamauchi K. Aizawa T. Hashizume K. Endocr. J. 2001; 48: 391-395Google Scholar, 9MacDonald M.J. Fahien L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34025-34027Google Scholar, 10Bertrand G. Ishiyama N. Nenquin M. Ravier M.A. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32883-32891Google Scholar) and is also not consistent with our proposal that the mutations of GDH that cause hyperinsulinism in children act by increasing the oxidation of glutamate and, presumably, the resulting decrease of the intracellular glutamate level. Because of the renewed interest in GDH as a potential key regulatory step in amino acid- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and because of the controversy about the direction of net flux through the enzyme, the present experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that LSIS is due to increased oxidation of glutamate by GDH and that this process is inhibited by glucose. Adult male Wistar rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (glucose-free; Sigma). The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and islets were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified incubator. Islets were cultured with different concentrations of glucose, 5, 10, and 25 mm for 3 to 4 days. 100 cultured rat islets were loaded onto nylon filters in a small chamber and perifused in a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mmol/liter NaCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, pH 7.4) with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Samples were collected every minute for insulin assay. Insulin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Islets were cultured with different concentration of glucose for 3–4 days. Batches of 100 islets were preincubated with glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 2 mm glutamine for 60 min. Islets were then incubated with 2 mm glutamine and different concentrations of leucine for another 60 min with 1 μCi of [1-14C]leucine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) present. A trap filter was placed in each tightly sealed glass tube to collect the 14CO2 produced by the islets, and the amount of radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3 days. Batches of 250 islets for each condition were then incubated with glucose-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer or 25 mm glucose for different time periods up to 120 min. Islets were then homogenized in 70 μl of buffer (0.1 m Tris acetate buffer with 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). GDH activity and ADP responsiveness were determined using the assay described by Wrzeszczynski and Colman (11Wrzeszczynski K.O. Colman R.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11544-11553Google Scholar) with modifications as described previously (2Stanley C.A. Fang J. Kutyna K. Hsu B.Y. Ming J.E. Glaser B. Poncz M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 667-673Google Scholar). Separate batches of 100 islets were taken to measure islet ATP. After brief centrifugation, 10 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid was added to the islet pellet and maintained at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then homogenized after adding 90 μl of buffer (0.1 mm Tris acetate buffer with 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0). Samples were stored at −80 °C until assay. ATP was assayed in triplicate by a luminimetric method using an ATP assay kit (Enliten ATP assay kits; Promega). Islets were cultured with 10 mm glucose for 3 to 4 days. Batches of 1,000 islets were first preincubated with unlabeled 10 mmglutamine in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 90 min at 37 °C. The islets were then incubated under the following conditions for another 120 min: 10 mm [2-15N]glutamine (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) as control. For the other conditions the medium contained, in addition to 10 mm [2-15N]glutamine, the following components: 10 mm leucine, 25 mm glucose, and 10 mm leucine and 25 mm glucose. Another group of islets was sampled at time 0 with 10 mm[2-15N]glutamine alone, the tube being placed on ice immediately after adding the buffer containing 10 mm[2-15N]glutamine. After incubation for 120 min, medium was sampled for total ammonia, insulin, and [15N]ammonia enrichment assays. Pellets were suspended and homogenized with 200 μl of 6% perchloric acid, neutralized to pH 7.0 with 1 mK2CO3 and centrifuged to remove the potassium perchlorate precipitate. The supernatant was used for determination of amino acids, as well as 15N enrichments. Ammonia was determined by a sensitive diffusion method on Vitros Chemistry Analyzer using Vitros AMON slide (Ortho-Clinical Diagnosis, Rochester, NY), which has a sensitivity of <2 μm. Intracellular amino acids were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry measurements of 15N isotopic enrichment (atom % excess, APE) were performed as described previously (12Brosnan J.T. Brosnan M.E. Yudkoff M. Nissim I. Daikhin Y. Lazarow A. Horyn O. Nissim I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31876-31882Google Scholar) using the Hewlett-Packard 5990 gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system.15NH3 was determined following conversion of ammonia to norvaline. 15N enrichment in amino acids was determined using the t-butyldimethyl-silyl derivatives. All chemicals were from Sigma except where indicated otherwise. The accumulation of15N-labeled metabolites is obtained by the product of their isotopic enrichment (atom % excess, APE, %) and their tissue concentrations (nmol/1000 islets). Ammonia production (P-NH4+) was calculated according to the equation, P-NH4+ = total-NH4+ − blank-NH4+. Flux through GDH was calculated from ammonia production and 15N enrichments, and also including the unlabeled glutamate and aspartate pool, according to the equation (Flux via GDH = [(P-NH4+)(APE-NH4+)]/[(APE-Glu + APE-Asp)(0.5)]). Flux through glutaminase was calculated from the sum of [15N]glutamate, [15N]aspartate production, and GDH flux. All the data are presented as mean ± S.E. Student's t tests were performed when two groups were compared. One way analysis of variances was used when multiple groups were compared. Differences were considered significant forp < 0.05. To determine the threshold concentration of stimulated insulin secretion in ramp perifusion studies, a ttest was used comparing the rates of each time point with base-line insulin secretion rates. The first point that was significantly different from base line was considered the threshold. Fig. 1 shows the insulin secretory responses of cultured rat islets to leucine, KIC, or glucose after perifusion in glucose-free buffer to allow run-down of energy stores for either a short (50-min) or a long (120-min) period. Islets cultured with medium containing 10 mm glucose followed by a short period of glucose depletion (50-min) failed to respond to 10 mmleucine (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, islets exposed to the longer period of glucose depletion (120-min) had a brisk, biphasic secretion of insulin in response to 10 mm leucine. After the longer periods of glucose depletion, base-line insulin release was 0.8 ± 0.1 ng/100 islets/min, and following leucine, the insulin secretion reached a peak of 6.8 ± 1.6 ng/100 islets/min followed by a second phase plateau of 10 ± 0.1 ng/100 islets/min. In contrast to leucine, both 10 mm KIC and 10 mm glucose were able to stimulate biphasic insulin release in islets exposed to glucose-free medium for 50 min (Fig. 1,B and C). Glucose stimulated nearly identical insulin responses after the short or long periods of energy depletion (Fig. 1 B). KIC at 10 mm caused a greater initial insulin peak (21 ± 4 versus 10 ± 4 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.001) and a higher second phase plateau (11 ± 0.3 versus 6 ± 0.2 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.001) in islets with 120-min run-down compared with islets with 50-min run-down (Fig. 1 C). Fig. 2 shows the effect of short or long periods of glucose depletion on islet sensitivity to stimulation with a leucine ramp. The threshold for stimulation of insulin release by leucine was lower in islets with 120-min run-down than islets with 50-min run-down (6 versus 14 mm leucine). Furthermore, maximum leucine-stimulated insulin secretion was doubled by extended glucose depletion (15 ± 1 versus 8 ± 3 ng/100 islets/min, p < 0.001). As shown in Fig. 3, the suppression of leucine-stimulated insulin release by glucose was concentration-dependent. When glucose was added to the perifusion buffer during the 120-min equilibration period and then removed for 20 min prior to stimulation with leucine, insulin release was partially inhibited by 10 mm glucose and completely suppressed by 25 mm glucose. In contrast, exposure to glucose had no effect on insulin release in response to depolarization with potassium chloride. When the glucose concentration of the medium used to culture isolated rat islets for 3 days prior to perifusion was reduced from 10 to 5 mm, a biphasic insulin response to stimulation by 10 mm leucine was observed even after very brief glucose depletion (data not shown). Fig. 4 shows the effect of increasing glutamine concentrations on glucose suppression of leucine-mediated insulin release. As shown in panel A, glucose suppression of LSIS was overcome in a dose-dependent manner by increasing the concentration of glutamine from 0 to 10 mm. In the absence of leucine, glutamine alone, even at 10 mm, did not stimulate insulin release. As shown in panel B, increasing the concentration of leucine from 10 to 20 mm increased insulin secretion in the presence of 5 and 10 mm glutamine but had very little added effect in the presence of 2 mmglutamine. These results showed that high leucine in the presence of high glutamine could overcome glucose inhibition of LSIS. To test whether the inhibitory effect of glucose on LSIS was on the pathway of leucine oxidation via KIC, the effect of glucose pretreatment on oxidation of [1-14C]leucine in the absence of glucose was examined (Fig. 5). Maximum rates of leucine oxidation were lowered by 30% with increasing concentrations of glucose pretreatment (p < 0.01). However, oxidation rates of 20 mm leucine by islets cultured in 10 mm glucose were 80% the rate with 10 mm leucine in islets cultured at 5 mm glucose. Studies of insulin secretion showed that islets cultured in 10 mm glucose did not respond to 20 mm leucine, whereas islets cultured with 5 mm glucose responded to 10 mm leucine. Thus, it seems that direct oxidation of leucine contributes little or nothing to the process responsible for LSIS. To determine the factors responsible for altering leucine sensitivity, we measured the effects of incubation in glucose-free medium for varying time on islet ATP concentrations and on basal and maximal GDH activity. As shown in TableI, withdrawal of glucose for 120 min resulted in a nearly 50% fall in islet ATP concentration. Basal GDH enzyme activity was ∼20% of the ADP-stimulated maximal value, suggesting carryover of inhibitors, such as GTP, in the crude islet homogenate. Basal GDH activity increased during the 120 min of glucose depletion by 40% without a change in maximal enzyme activity, consistent with a decline in islet content of GTP and ATP, which are potent allosteric inhibitors of the enzyme.Table IEffect of run-down duration on islet ATP and GDH activityIncubation conditionsATP (n = 3)GDHBasal activity (n = 6)Response to 200 μm ADP (n = 4)pmol/isletnmol/min/100 isletsInitial, G, 08.8 ± 1.20.6 ± 0.054.8 ± 0.450 min, G, 06.3 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.041-aCompared with initial, G, 0,p < 0.05.4.6 ± 0.9120 min, G, 04.8 ± 0.81-aCompared with initial, G, 0,p < 0.05.1.0 ± 0.081-bCompared with initial, G, 0,p < 0.01.5.3 ± 0.7120 min, G, 258.8 ± 0.61-cCompared with 120 min, G, 0,p < 0.01.0.7 ± 0.071-cCompared with 120 min, G, 0,p < 0.01.5.3 ± 0.7Values are means ± S.E.1-a Compared with initial, G, 0,p < 0.05.1-b Compared with initial, G, 0,p < 0.01.1-c Compared with 120 min, G, 0,p < 0.01.

To examine in detail the effects of leucine and glucose on rates of flux through GDH, experiments were carried out using 2-15N-labeled glutamine to trace the flow of the amino nitrogen into glutamate and ammonia. A 90-min pre-incubation in unlabeled 10 mm glutamine was used to mimic the condition of prolonged glucose depletion. Incubations with 10 mm [2-15N]glutamine alone or together with leucine, glucose, or leucine plus glucose were then carried out for 2 h using batches of 1,000 isolated rat islets per tube. As shown in Table II, both leucine and glucose stimulated insulin secretion by these islets. However, the combination of the two gave the same rates of insulin release as glucose alone, consistent with glucose inhibition of LSIS seen previously. The intracellular concentrations of glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, alanine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were measurable under these conditions. Islet glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and alanine concentrations remained relatively constant during the 2-h control incubation with 10 mm glutamine. Incubation with 10 mm leucine did not change islet glutamate concentrations but caused a 30% decrease in aspartate concentrations compared with control. Incubation with 25 mm glucose caused a 40% decrease of glutamate and a 70% decrease of aspartate concentrations. The combination of leucine plus glucose further decreased aspartate concentrations and partly reversed the glucose-induced depression of glutamate concentrations. The intracellular alanine concentrations were very small compared with the glutamate and aspartate pools. Alanine concentrations rose in the presence of glucose, consistent with increased glycolytic flux to pyruvate and subsequent transamination to yield alanine.Table IIInsulin secretion and islet amino acid concentrations (nmol/1000 islets)Insulin secretionGlutamineGlutamateAspartateAlanineGABAμg/1000 islets/2 hTime 0ND100 ± 2525 ± 1.330 ± 0.60.5 ± 0.0316 ± 0.3Control0.7 ± 0.187 ± 523 ± 0.739 ± 1.10.5 ± 0.0313 ± 0.5Leucine, 10 mm6.1 ± 0.32-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.70 ± 521 ± 0.526 ± 1.42-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.0.5 ± 0.0112 ± 1.9Glucose, 25 mm3.5 ± 0.32-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.82 ± 714 ± 0.42-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-bCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.11 ± 0.52-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.2.0 ± 0.132-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.10 ± 0.9Leucine, 10 mm and glucose 25 mm4.0 ± 0.52-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-bCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.75 ± 1117 ± 2.49 ± 0.92-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.2.9 ± 0.282-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.2-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.12 ± 2.8ND, not determined.2-a Compared with control,p < 0.01.2-b Compared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.2-c Compared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.

The isotopic enrichment of glutamate and aspartate was decreased by 10–20% in the presence of leucine, consistent with some contribution of unlabeled nitrogen from leucine through transamination. Glucose decreased the concentrations but not the isotopic enrichment of both glutamate and aspartate, indicting that glucose suppressed flux from glutamine through glutaminase into these amino acids. Isotopic enrichment of GABA was not determined, but turnover of this pool was likely to have been small, because the concentrations of GABA remained essentially unchanged under all of the incubation conditions (TableII).Table IIIRates of production of ammonia, [ 15 N]glutamate, and [ 15 N]aspartate; 15 N isotopic enrichments and flux through GDH and glutaminase in cultured rat isletsAmmonia production[15N]APEProductionFluxAmmoniaGlutamateAspartate[15N]Glu[15N]AspGDHGlutaminasenmol/1000 islets/2hnmol/1000 islets/2hnmol/1000 islets/2hControl130 ± 117 ± 1.263 ± 2.366 ± 2.314 ± 0.526 ± 0.416 ± 357 ± 4Leucine 10 mm217 ± 73-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.14 ± 0.73-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.50 ± 0.73-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.55 ± 1.33-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.10 ± 0.13-bCompared with control,p < 0.05.14 ± 1.13-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.56 ± 23-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.81 ± 33-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.Glucose 25 mm93 ± 93-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.5 ± 0.83-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.62 ± 0.83-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.62 ± 1.33-dCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.9 ± 0.33-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.7 ± 0.43-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.7 ± 13-bCompared with control,p < 0.05.3-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.22 ± 23-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.Leucine 10 mm and glucose 25 mm80 ± 173-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.5 ± 0.33-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.43 ± 0.13-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.46 ± 0.43-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-dCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.7 ± 1.03-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-dCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05.4 ± 0.43-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.9 ± 23-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.20 ± 33-aCompared with control,p < 0.01.3-cCompared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.3-a Compared with control,p < 0.01.3-b Compared with control,p < 0.05.3-c Compared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.01.3-d Compared with leucine 10 mm, p < 0.05. Open table in a new tab As shown in Table III, total ammonia production from the combination of the glutaminase and GDH reactions was stimulated by leucine and suppressed by glucose. In the presence of glucose, the stimulation of ammonia release by leucine was inhibited. The isotopic enrichment of ammonia was significantly increased by incubation with leucine, confirming increased flux through both the glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase steps. Table III shows the calculated rates of 15N-labeled glutamate and aspartate production from glutamine and of the flux rates through the glutaminase and GDH steps. Production of glutamate and, especially, aspartate were decreased by incubation with leucine compared with control and further suppressed by incubation with glucose or glucose plus leucine. Leucine stimulation produced a 350% increase in flux through GDH and a 140% increase in flux through glutaminase compared with the control islets. In contrast, glucose stimulation of islets was associated with a 50% reduction in flux through both GDH and glutaminase. The stimulatory effects of leucine on GDH and glutaminase flux were blocked in the presence of glucose, consistent with the observation that glucose also blocked leucine-stimulated insulin release. The discovery of the GDH linked form of hyperinsulinism has made it important to explore the mechanisms of increased protein and leucine sensitivity of insulin secretion observed in patients with this disorder. The present report describes a robust experimental model in isolated cultured rat islets using a paradigm of energy depletion, or run-down, to test the sensitivity for LSIS. The results show that the energy potential regulates glutaminolysis and modifies the sensitivity of β-cells to leucine stimulation. A prolonged period of run-down to produce a state of energy depletion sensitizes the islet to leucine stimulation. In contrast, with a short period of run-down after withdrawal of high glucose, islets maintain a high energy potential and are insensitive to leucine stimulation. The present results show that the mechanism of LSIS is not primarily through the leucine oxidation pathway, but, as illustrated in Fig. 6, is because of increased glutamine catabolism with enhanced flux through the glutaminase and GDH reactions. Glucose suppression of LSIS involves inhibition of both of these two enzyme steps in glutamine oxidation by an indirect mechanism involving changes in the concentrations of high energy phosphates, GTP and ATP, and of ADP and Pi in β-cells. The results of the present experiments demonstrate that LSIS is conditional, in contrast to the commonly held concept that leucine is comparable with glucose in potency as an insulin secretogogue. These studies clarify previous observations in the isolated perfused rat pancreas showing that LSIS is induced by fuel depletion (13Matschinsky F.M. Fertel R. Kotler-Brajtburg J. Stillings S. Ellerman J. Raybaud F. Holowach-Thurston J. Musacchia X.J. Breitenbach R.P. Proceedings of the Eighth Midwest Conference on Endocrinology and Metabolism, October 6–7, 1972. University of Missouri, Columbia, MO1972: 63-87Google Scholar). The conditional nature of LSIS is also consistent with observations in humans showing that normal healthy subjects do not become hypoglycemic in response to intravenous leucine but become sensitive to leucine after treatment with a sulfonylurea drug, such as tolbutamide (14Fajans S.S Floyd J.C., Jr. Knopf R.F. Conn F.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1967; 23: 617-662Google Scholar). Because LSIS is mediated by allosteric activation of GDH (15Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Nature. 1980; 288: 187-189Google Scholar), islet responsiveness to leucine is directly related to the state of GDH enzymatic activity. Thus, patients with the GDH-linked form of hyperinsulinism are hypersensitive to leucine stimulation (1Stanley C.A. Lieu Y.K. Hsu B.Y. Burlina A.B. Greenberg C.R. Hopwood N.J. Perlman K. Rich B.H.

Metab. 2001; 86: 1782-1787Google Scholar), because of mutations that impair responsiveness to GTP and result in a loss of negative allosteric regulation. In isolated mouse islets, Gaoet al. (5Gao Z.Y., Li, G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Google Scholar) have reported that leucine-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium is blocked after treatment with high glucose. In addition, in mouse islets, the enhancement of [U-14C]glutamine oxidation by the leucine analog 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid, was inhibited by glucose treatment (5Gao Z.Y., Li, G. Najafi H. Wolf B.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1535-1542Google Scholar). In the present study, the run-down paradigm clearly showed that the dynamic changes in sensitivity of LSIS reflect the regulation of GDH enzymatic activity by the β-cells energy potential. Fig. 6 illustrates some of the interactions revealed by the present experiments in the glucose and leucine regulation of glutaminolysis and flux through GDH. During post-prandial hyperglycemia, glucose is the predominant energy source of β-cells, and glucose metabolism increases the levels of ATP and GTP while decreasing the concentrations of ADP, GDP, and Pi (16Detimary P. Van den Berghe G. Henquin J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20559-20565Google Scholar, 17Trus M. Warner H. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 1-14Google Scholar). The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of GTP and ATP for allosteric inhibition of GDH are 50–100 nm and 10–20 μm, respectively (3MacMullen C. Fang J. Hsu B.Y. Kelly A. de Lonlay-Debeney P. Saudubray J.M. Ganguly A. Smith T.J. Stanley C.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1782-1787Google Scholar). These values are well below the intramitochondrial concentrations of these nucleotides, implying that GDH activity might be totally inhibited by the enhanced glucose metabolism following a meal. Under such conditions of high energy potential, GDH becomes refractory to activation by leucine. During energy depletion, the ratio of ATP and GTP to ADP and Pi decreases, and the sensitivity of GDH to allosteric stimulation becomes augmented. The data shown in Table Isuggest that the phosphate potential gradually decreases during islet run-down until it reaches a critical threshold, at which point islets become sensitive to leucine. Previous studies of glutaminolysis in islets that have used [14C]glutamine as a tracer to follow the flux of glutamine into CO2 were unable to distinguish between transamination of glutamate and oxidative deamination. In the present study, by using [2-15N]glutamine we were able to directly follow the fate of the amino nitrogen of glutamine and the changes associated with leucine and glucose stimulation. The results highlight the fact that both glutaminase and GDH are regulated by the phosphate potential and are involved in the suppression of LSIS by glucose. Glutaminase, the pathway-controlling step in glutaminolysis, is a phosphate-dependent enzyme in islets (18Michalik M. Nelson J. Erecinska M. Metabolism. 1992; 41: 1319-1326Google Scholar). Thus, glucose may inhibit glutaminase by decreasing the inorganic phosphate level. Because glutamate is a strong inhibitor of glutaminase, leucine may indirectly stimulate the enzyme by removing glutamate as a result of activation of GDH (see Table III). Thus, regulation of glutaminolysis is the result of the inhibition or activation of these two enzymes. Although the present experiments were designed to investigate ammonia release from GDH deamination and the glutaminase reactions, some of the alterations in islet amino acid metabolism observed during incubation with glucose and leucine involve transamination reactions. For example, under conditions in which islets were incubated with glutamine as the sole fuel, the 15N tracer studies indicate that glutamine is oxidized through glutamate, enters the Krebs cycle at α-ketoglutarate, and exits at oxaloacetate (OAA) by transamination to aspartate through aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Fig. 6). This partial Krebs cycle pathway has also been demonstrated in brain (19Yudkoff M. Nelson D. Daikhin Y. Erecinska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27414-27420Google Scholar). In this study, glutamate carbon accumulated in the form of aspartate when glutamate was the sole carbon source, and the transfer of carbons from glutamate to aspartate could be blocked by the aminotransferase inhibitor, amino oxyacetate. In the present experiments, addition of glucose or glucose plus leucine decreased the ratio of aspartate to glutamate in islets, because the generation of acetyl-CoA from glycolysis allows the Krebs cycle to proceed past oxaloacetate, thus reducing the ratio of oxaloacetate to α-ketoglutarate and shifting the aspartate aminotransferase reaction toward glutamate formation. The reduction of 15N labeling of the glutamate and aspartate pools by addition of leucine probably reflects donation of the leucine amino group by transamination to glutamate and KIC. The fact that glucose inhibits LSIS but has little effect on KIC-stimulated insulin release indicates that allosteric activation of GDH is the primary mechanism by which leucine produces insulin release, under the conditions of the present experiments. The present experiments were designed to measure the oxidative deamination of glutamate through GDH. The results are compatible with the concept that the predominant direction of the GDH reaction in intact islets incubated with glutamine plus or minus leucine or glucose is toward glutamate oxidation. The present observations are consistent with studies by Cooper and co-workers (20Gross M. Cooper A.J. Meister A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 373-380Google Scholar, 21Cooper A.J. McDonald J.M. Gelbard A.S. Gledhill R.F. Duffy T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4982-4992Google Scholar) in liver and by Yudkoffet al. (22Yudkoff M. Nissim I. Nelson D. Lin Z.P. Erecinska M. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 153-160Google Scholar) in brain indicating that the GDH reaction runs exclusively in the oxidative direction under normal conditions. As these investigators have pointed out, flux toward glutamate synthesis is not likely, because normal concentrations of ammonia are over 100 times lower than the K m for ammonia of the GDH reaction. The present experiments do not lend support to the hypothesis of Maechler and Wollheim (6Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Google Scholar) that the GDH reaction runs toward glutamate formation during glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Indeed, under the conditions used, addition of glucose suppressed both glutamate concentrations and the activity of the GDH reaction. However, the present experiments cannot completely exclude the hypothesis put forth by Maechler and Wollheim (6Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Google Scholar), because direct measurements were not made of reductive amination flux through GDH. The present experiments highlight the importance of a GDH-linked metabolic network in β-cells as illustrated in Fig. 6. The key enzymes in this network include phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG), GDH, and aspartate aminotransferase. An increased phosphate potential leads to inhibition of both PDG and GDH, indicating that PDG and GDH may serve as intracellular energy sensors to regulate amino acid metabolism. The metabolism of glucose may control the intracellular amino acid homeostasis by changing the phosphate potential. The changing of aspartate indicates that the transamination reaction plays an important role in glucose and amino acid metabolism in islets. In conclusion, GDH and glutaminase play important roles in insulin secretion stimulated by a mixture of glutamine and leucine. The sensitivity of islets to leucine stimulation is tightly regulated by the energy potential. GDH and glutaminase may serve as intracellular energy sensors to control the islet responsiveness to leucine stimulation. We thank Dr. Henry Drott for technical assistance."

Research over the past decade has identified many types of protein-protein interactions that participate in intracellular signaling pathways (5Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1987; 278: 2075-2080Crossref Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). A common feature of such pathways is the involvement of several types of small protein domains (<100 residues) whose sole function is to recognize sequence motifs presented by other members of the pathway (6Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 7Lee C.H. Cowburn D. Kuriyan J. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 3-31PubMed Google Scholar). Single proteins often contain multiple copies of the same or different protein interaction modules, permitting the formation of the complex, multicomponent assemblies necessary to transmit a specific signal. Indeed, some proteins contain only protein interaction modules and may be considered adapters or scaffolds on which other “active” components of a signaling pathway are brought into proximity (8Cowburn D. Structure. 1996; 4: 1005-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although these interaction domains are often readily identified on the basis of primary sequence, identification of the binding partner relevant to a particular signaling cascade is often difficult. The PDZ domain, so-called because it was first recognized in the proteins post-synaptic density-95, discs large, and zonula occludens 1 (9Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B.

As many as 440 PDZ domains in 259 different proteins have been proposed to exist within the human genome (12Schultz J. Copley R.R. Doerks T. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are ∼90 residues in size and adopt a common fold consisting of a β-barrel capped by α-helices (13Morais Cabral J.H. Petosa C. Sutcliffe M.J. Raza S. Byron O. Poy F. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The predominant function of PDZ domains is to recognize the extreme C termini of other proteins, thereby bringing signaling pathway components into proximity (14Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B.

The LAP (leucine-rich repeat andPDZ-containing) proteins are a recently described family of scaffold proteins that are involved in the formation of membrane complexes and the maintenance of epithelial and neuronal cell shape and polarity (25Bryant P.J. Huwe A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E141-E143Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For example, in Drosophila, mutation of the Scribble LAP protein results in loss of epithelial cell polarity and morphology as well as uncontrolled, tumor-like growth (26Bilder D. Perrimon N. Nature. 2000; 403: 676-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The LAP proteins have a domain structure comprising 16 N-terminal leucine-rich repeats and up to four C-terminal PDZ domains. On the basis of yeast two-hybrid experiments, a mammalian LAP protein that recognizes the C terminus of ERB-B2 (a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family) has been identified and given the name Erbin, forERB-interacting protein (27Borg J.P.

More recently, we have used C-terminal phage display (23Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) to identify optimal ligands for the Erbin PDZ domain (24Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R.

These ligands are quite different in sequence from the C terminus of ERB-B2 and also bind ∼1000-fold more tightly to Erbin PDZ than the C-terminal peptide from ERB-B2 (24Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol.

Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data suggest that LAP proteins are targeted to p120-catenin-localized junctional regions via a PDZ-mediated interaction (24Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have explored in detail the interactions between Erbin PDZ and the optimal phage-derived peptide ligand. A preference for a penultimate tryptophan residue in the ligand has been confirmed by extensive phage library selections, a feature that is also present in the optimal ligand for the second PDZ domain of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase Magi-3 (23Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Affinity measurements of synthetic peptide analogs of the optimal ligand have been made to quantitate the energetic contributions of the five C-terminal ligand residues; the penultimate tryptophan is indeed beneficial to binding (affinity decreases by >1000-fold when replaced by alanine). An efficient phage-based combinatorial scanning approach has also been utilized to identify residues within Erbin PDZ that contribute energetically to ligand binding (30Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although we have previously described a homology-based model of a domain of Magi-3 (23Fuh G. Pisabarro M.T. Li Y. Quan C. Lasky L.A. Sidhu S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21486-21491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the use of homology modeling to interpret the structure-activity data is of limited value because the primary sequence of Erbin PDZ differs in several key regions from that of other PDZ domains whose structures are known (Fig. 1). Thus, we have also used NMR spectroscopy to determine the structure of Erbin PDZ in complex with the p120-catenin-like phage-derived ligand. 1Model 2 in this ensemble is closest to the geometric mean and has been used as a representative single structure for the figures in this manuscript. 1Model 2 in this ensemble is closest to the geometric mean and has been used as a representative single structure for the figures in this manuscript. This structure provides a clear view of the interactions made by the penultimate tryptophan residue and more generally provides a framework within which to understand the affinity and selectivity of peptide binding to Erbin PDZ. This work provides one of the most extensive characterizations to date of the structural and energetic (ligand and protein) components of a PDZ domain interaction with a C-terminal peptide. Enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Maxisorp immunoplates and 384-well assay plates were from Nalge NUNC International (Naperville, IL).

AlphaScreenTM reagents and a plate reader were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides for combinatorial scanning were designed as described previously using equimolar DNA degeneracies (30Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protocols, cleaved off the resin with 2.5% triisopropylsilane and 2.5% H2O in trifluoroacetic acid, and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purity and mass of each peptide were verified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Previously described procedures were used to isolate peptides that bound to a GST-Erbin2 PDZ fusion, using a library of random heptapeptides fused to the C terminus of the M13 gene-8 major coat protein (23Fuh G.

After two rounds of selection, individual clones were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μl of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (31Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to detect peptides that bound specifically to Erbin PDZ. A total of 148 peptide sequences derived from positive clones were aligned, and the occurrence of each natural amino acid at each position was tabulated. The occurrence of each amino acid was normalized by dividing by the number of times the amino acid was encoded by the NNS codon. The normalized data set was used to calculate the percentage of occurrence of each amino acid at each position (see TableI).Table IStatistical analysis of Erbin PDZ binding specificityPositionaPositions in the peptide ligand, from the C terminus to the N terminus, are designated 0, −1, etc.Occurrence of amino acid typeTrpPheTyrMetLeuIleValCysAlaGlyProGlnAsnThrSerHisArgLysGluAsp%02.71.496−1100−22.980141.41.4−31.40.23662−4288.67.85.22.65.21.70.91.74.32.62.61.70.91.73.45.25.23.46.9−5187.58.50.90.92.81.91.9103.86.62.81.92.86.63.82.85.711−6112.82.82.81.44.26.94.2111.45.62.84.28.32.813111.42.8Erbin PDZ-binding peptides were isolated from a random heptapeptide library, 148 sequences were aligned, and the occurrence of each amino acid at each position was tabulated.

The percentage of occurrence of each amino acid type at each position was calculated after normalization for codon bias. The preferred residue at each position is shown in bold type. Erbin PDZ was displayed on the surface of M13 bacteriophage by modifying a previously described phagemid (pS1602) (32Sidhu S.S. Weiss G.A. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Standard molecular biology techniques were used to replace the fragment of pS1602 encoding human growth hormone with a DNA fragment encoding Erbin PDZ. The resulting phagemid (pS2202d) contained an open reading frame that encoded the maltose-binding protein secretion signal, followed by an epitope tag (amino acid sequence: SMADPNRFRGKDLGS), followed by Erbin PDZ and ending with the C-terminal domain of the M13 gene-3 minor coat protein. E. coliharboring pS2202d were co-infected with M13-VCS helper phage and grown at 37 °C without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, resulting in the production of phage particles that encapsulated pS2202d DNA and displayed Erbin PDZ in a monovalent format. Libraries were constructed using previously described methods (31Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with appropriately designed “stop template” versions of pS2202d. For each library, we used a stop template that contained TAA stop codons within each of the regions to be mutated. The stop template was used as the template for the Kunkel mutagenesis method (33Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar) with mutagenic oligonucleotides (see above) designed to simultaneously repair the stop codons and introduce mutations at the desired sites. For shotgun scanning, wild type codons were replaced with the corresponding degenerate codons shown in Table I of Vajdos et al. (34Vajdos F.F. Adams C.W. Breece T.N. Presta L.G. de Vos A.M. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 302: 415-428Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Two separate libraries were constructed with each library designed to mutate 22 Erbin PDZ residues with no overlap between the two. Libraries A1 and A2 were constructed with mutagenic oligonucleotides A1a and A1b or A2aand A2b, respectively. Library A1 mutated residues in two continuous stretches of sequence between positions 16–28 and 46–55, whereas library A2 mutated residues between positions 31–43 and 78–95. For the shotgun homolog scan, libraries H1 and H2 were constructed in an analogous fashion with mutagenic oligonucleotidesH1a and H1b or H2a and H2b, respectively. The library diversities were as follows: A1, 4.2 × 1010; A2, 4.0 × 1010; H1, 4.4 × 1010; and H2, 4.2 × 1010. Phage from the libraries described above were propagated in E. coli XL1-blue with the addition of M13-VCS helper phage. After overnight growth at 37 °C, phage were concentrated by precipitation with polyethylene glycol/NaCl and resuspended in PBS, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 as described previously (31Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phage solutions (1012 phage/ml) were added to 96-well Maxisorp immunoplates that had been coated with capture target and blocked with bovine serum albumin. Two different targets were used; for the display selection the target was an immobilized antibody that recognized the epitope tag fused to the N terminus of Erbin PDZ, whereas for the function selection a biotinylated peptide that binds to Erbin PDZ with high affinity (biotin-TGWETWV) (24Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates. Following a 2-h incubation to allow for phage binding, the plates were washed 10 times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. Bound phage were eluted with 0.1 m HCl for 10 min, and the eluent was neutralized with 1.0 m Tris base. Eluted phage were amplified in E. coli XL1-blue and used for further rounds of selection. Individual clones from each round of selection were grown in a 96-well format in 500 μl of 2YT broth supplemented with carbenicillin and M13-VCS, and the culture supernatants were used directly in phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (31Sidhu S.S. Lowman H.B. Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 333-363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to detect phage-displayed Erbin PDZ variants that bound to either biotin-TGWETWV or anti-tag antibody. After two rounds of selection, greater than 50% of the clones exhibited positive phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay signals at least 2-fold greater than signals on control plates coated with bovine serum albumin. These positive clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis (see below). The sequences were analyzed with the program SGCOUNT as described previously (30Weiss G.A. Watanabe C.K. Zhong A. Goddard A. Sidhu S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8950-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). SGCOUNT aligned each DNA sequence against the wild type DNA sequence by using a Needleman-Wunch pairwise alignment algorithm, translated each aligned sequence of acceptable quality, and tabulated the occurrence of each natural amino acid at each position. For the function selection, the number of analyzed clones are indicated in parentheses following the name of each library: A1 (185 clones), A2 (180 clones), H1 (190 clones), and H2 (170 clones). For the display selection, the following numbers of clones were analyzed: A1 (83 clones), A2 (83 clones), H1 (94 clones), and H2 (96 clones). Culture supernatants containing phage particles were used as templates for PCRs that amplified DNA fragments containing the Erbin PDZ gene, and these fragments were sequenced as described previously (34Vajdos F.F. Adams C.W. Breece T.N. Presta L.G. de Vos A.M. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 302: 415-428Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). An Erbin PDZ construct with GST fused to the N terminus was prepared as described (24Laura R.P. Witt A.S. Held H.A. Gerstner R. Deshayes K. Koehler M.F. Kosik K.S. Sidhu S.S. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12906-12914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The binding affinities of peptides for Erbin PDZ were determined as IC50 values using the AlphaScreenTM, a bead-based chemiluminescence assay with optimized concentration of reagents. The IC50was defined as the concentration of peptide that blocked 50% of the chemiluminescence arising from the interaction of anti-GST acceptor beads coated with Erbin PDZ-GST and streptavidin donor beads coated with biotinylated peptide (biotin-TGWETWV). The assays were performed at room temperature in white opaque 384-well plates (25 μl/well) under subdued lighting to reduce nonspecific chemiluminescence. The assay buffer was PBS, 0.5% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine γ-globulin, 1 ppm proclin. The reaction mixture contained fixed concentrations of anti-GST acceptor beads (16 μg/ml), biotin-TGWETWV (36 nm), and Erbin PDZ-GST (3 nm). Serial dilutions of peptide were added, followed by addition of streptavidin donor beads (20 μg/ml). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h and read on an AlphaQuest plate reader set at 1 s/well. A DNA fragment encoding residues 1273–1371 of Erbin was cloned into theNdeI/BamHI sites of the pET15b expression vector, creating a fusion with an N-terminal His tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. E. coli BL21 cultures harboring the expression plasmid were grown at 37 °C to mid-log phase (A 600 = 0.7) in M9 medium with15NH4Cl or15NH4Cl/13C glucose supplemented with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1.0 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested after 2 h further growth by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 15 min and stored at −80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and sonicated for 3 min on ice. The suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and then the protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, thrombin was added (1 unit/mg of protein), and the sample was dialyzed overnight against PBS at 4 °C. The protein sample was then concentrated and further purified over a Superdex-75 column in PBS to remove thrombin and the cleaved His tag. The identity of the purified protein was verified by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. In addition to Erbin PDZ domain (residues 1273–1371), the construct also contains an N-terminal GSHM tail from the expression vector (i.e. Gly5 of the present construct corresponds to Gly1273 of full-length Erbin). NMR samples typically contained 1.0–1.5 mm protein, 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm d 11-2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-s-sulphonate (DSS) for chemical shift referencing in 93% H2O, 7% D2O. A “100% D2O” sample was prepared by lyophilization and resuspension in 99.995% D2O. NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on Bruker DRX600 and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with triple resonance, triple axis actively shielded gradient probes. Addition of the phage-optimized peptide (AcTGWETWV) to Erbin PDZ indicated that t"

Pax8, the only member of the family expressed in the thyroid tissue, is involved in the morphogenesis of the gland and in the transcriptional regulation of thyroid-specific genes. TTF-1, a homeodomain-containing factor, is also expressed in the thyroid tissue and has been demonstrated to play a role in thyroid-specific gene expression. Despite the presence of Pax8 and TTF-1 also in a few other tissues, the simultaneous expression of the two transcription factors occurs only in the thyroid, supporting the idea that Pax8 and TTF-1 might cooperate to influence thyroid-specific gene expression. In this report, we describe a physical and functional interaction between these two factors. The fusion protein GST-Pax8 is able to bind TTF-1 present in thyroid or in non-thyroid cell extracts, and by using bacterial purified TTF-1 we demonstrate that the interaction is direct. By co-immunoprecipitation, we also show that the interaction between the two proteins occursin vivo in thyroid cells. Moreover, Pax8 and TTF-1 when co-expressed in HeLa cells synergistically activate Tg gene transcription. The synergism requires the N-terminal activation domain of TTF-1, and deletions of Pax8 indicate that the C-terminal domain of the protein is involved.

The vast majority of the promoters of genes expressed in a cell type-specific fashion contains a variety of recognition sequences for tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. It is well known that tissue-specific transcriptional regulation is mediated by a set of transcription factors whose combination is unique to the cell type. Thyroid follicular cells, the most abundant cell population of the thyroid gland, represent a useful model system to elucidate the mechanism operating in the establishment and maintenance of cell type-specific expression. Thyrocytes are responsible for thyroid hormone synthesis and are characterized by the expression of a specific set of genes such as thyroglobulin (Tg)1 and thyroperoxidase (TPO), which are exclusively expressed in this cell type (1Damante G. Di Lauro R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 255-266Google Scholar, 2Damante G. Tell G. Di Lauro R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 307-356Google Scholar), and by the expression of genes expressed only in a few tissues other than the thyroid, such as the thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor and the sodium/iodide symporter. The Tg and TPO promoters have been extensively studied, and multiple factors have been shown to be required for their expression (3Sinclair A.J. Lonigro R. Civitareale D. Ghibelli L. Di Lauro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Google Scholar, 4Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Google Scholar). To date, three transcription factors that specifically bind to and regulate these promoters have been cloned (2Damante G. Tell G. Di Lauro R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 66: 307-356Google Scholar). The three transcription factors are as follows: thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), thyroid transcription factor-2 (TTF-2), and Pax8. TTF-1 (also named NKx 2.1 and T/EBP) is a homeodomain-containing protein expressed in embryonic diencephalon, thyroid, and lung (5Lazzaro D. Price M. Felice M.D. DiLauro R. Development. 1991; 113: 1093-1104Google Scholar). TTF-2 is a forkhead domain-containing protein expressed in pituitary and thyroid (6Zannini M. Avantaggiato V. Biffali E. Arnne M. Sato K. Pischetola M. Taylor B. Phillips S. Simeone A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3185-3197Google Scholar), and Pax8 is a member of the murine Pax family of paired domain-containing genes that is expressed in kidney, in the developing excretory system, and in the thyroid (7Plachov D. Chowdhury K. Walther C. Simon D. Guenet J.-L. Gruss P. Development. 1990; 110: 643-651Google Scholar). We have focused our studies on the molecular mechanisms of action of TTF-1 and Pax8. These two transcription factors are present together only in the thyroid, suggesting that this unique combination could be responsible for early commitment and differentiation of thyrocytes. TTF-1 was originally identified as a protein binding to a DNA sequence that is present three times on both the Tg and the TPO promoters. Furthermore, TTF-1 was shown to be involved in the activation of thyroid-specific gene expression (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar). In fact, TTF-1 is able to activate transcription from the Tg promoter and, albeit at a much lower level, from the TPO promoter both in thyroid and non-thyroid cells. Parallel to its function in the thyroid, TTF-1 plays a critical role also in lung morphogenesis and in respiratory epithelial cell gene expression. It has been demonstrated that TTF-1 is required for the transcriptional activation of surfactant proteins A, B, and C (SP-A, SP-B, and SP-C) and Clara cell secretory protein (9Bruno M.D. Bohinski R.J.

Fernandez-Salguero P. Fox C.H. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 60-69Google Scholar), and the homozygous mice are not viable. Recently, it has been published that TTF-1 and GATA-6 are co-expressed in the respiratory epithelium in vivo and in respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. It has been also demonstrated (15Liu C. Glasser S.W. Wan H. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4519-4525Google Scholar) that TTF-1 and GATA-6 directly interact and have a synergistic effect on the transcriptional activation of the SP-C promoter. The Pax gene family encodes for DNA-binding proteins that are involved in the regulation of the development of a variety of tissues in different species. Specifically, Pax8 has been demonstrate to be required both for morphogenesis of the thyroid gland (16Mansouri A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 87-90Google Scholar) and for maintenance of thyroid-differentiated phenotype (17Pasca di Magliano M., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13144-13149Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in Pax8 control of differentiation have been investigated in detail. Pax8 binds to a single site on the Tg and on the TPO promoters, and in both cases, the Pax8-binding site overlaps with one of the TTF-1-binding site (4Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Google Scholar, 18Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachv D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). In addition, Pax8 was shown, in transient transfection assays, to activate transcription from the TPO and the Tg promoters in non-thyroid cells (18Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachv D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). Recently, direct evidence of the ability of Pax8 to activate transcription of thyroid-specific genes at their chromosomal locus was obtained (17Pasca di Magliano M., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13144-13149Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Pax8 knockout mice the thyroid gland is barely visible and lacks follicular cells (16Mansouri A. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 87-90Google Scholar). Recent studies (19Mascia A. Nitsch L., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 163-176Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in rat differentiated thyroid cells in culture (the PC Cl3 cell line), the thyrotropin-stimulating hormone regulates the expression of both thyroglobulin and Pax8 genes by a cAMP-mediated mechanism. Taken together, all the data present in the literature to date strongly suggest a fundamental role of Pax8 in the maintenance of functional differentiation in thyroid cells. Despite the critical role during development and in human diseases of the Pax proteins, the biochemical basis of their function within the cell nucleus is poorly understood. The functional role of TTF-1- and Pax8-binding sites within the Tg and TPO promoters has been studied in rat, bovine, and human Tg gene promoters (18Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachv D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar, 20Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Mercuri F. Tell G. Damante G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 347-354Google Scholar, 21Javaux F. Bertaux F. Donda A.

Some studies (17Pasca di Magliano M., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13144-13149Google Scholar) have suggested that there might be a functional cooperation between the two transcription factors in the transcriptional activation of thyroid-specific promoters. Recently, it has been proposed that TTF-1 and Pax8 cooperate in the stimulation of the TPO (23Miccadei S., De Leo R. Zammarchi E. Natali P.G. Civitareale D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 837-846Google Scholar) and of the human Tg (22Espinoza C.R. Schmitt T.L. Loos U. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 27: 59-67Google Scholar) gene promoters. However, the demonstration of a direct interaction has not yet been provided. The aim of our study was to investigate a possible biochemical and functional interaction between TTF-1 and Pax8. Indeed, we were able to show a physical interaction between TTF-1 and Pax8, both in thyroid and non-thyroid cells. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed using thyroid cell extracts confirmed the existence of a complex between Pax8 and TTF-1 in vivo. Moreover, we observed an impressive synergistic effect of the two transcription factors on the Tg promoter activation. The synergism involves a specific region of the Tg promoter (region C), that is the most proximal to the start of transcription where TTF-1 and Pax8 binding sites overlap. In addition, by mutational analysis we have identified the portions of TTF-1 and Pax8 proteins responsible for the physical and functional interaction. In conclusion, this paper describes a physical and functional interaction between an homeodomain-containing factor and a paired domain-containing factor, both involved in the regulation of tissue-specific transcription. The GST-Pax8 fusion protein was generated by PCR amplification of Pax8 coding region and subsequent subcloning in theEcoRI site of the pGEX-4T vector. The orientation of the fragment and the correct frame of the fusion were verified by DNA sequencing. 3xFLAG-Pax8 was generated by PCR amplification of Pax8 coding region and subsequent cloning in the EcoRI-XbaI sites of the 3xFLAG CMV-10 vector (Sigma). The plasmids used in transient transfection experiments have been described previously and are as follows: Tg-CAT (3Sinclair A.J. Lonigro R. Civitareale D. Ghibelli L. Di Lauro R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 311-318Google Scholar); Tg-CAT Acore (24Civitareale D. Lonigro R. Sinclair A.J. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2537-2542Google Scholar); TPO-LUC (4Francis-Lang H. Price M. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. DiLauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 576-588Google Scholar); CMV-TTF-1 (25Guazzi S. Price M. Felice M.D. Damante G. Mattei M.G. DiLauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Google Scholar); Δ1, Δ33, Δ2, Δ14, Δ3 (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar); and pCMV5-Pax8 (18Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachv D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). Expression vectors encoding Pax8 splicing variants are described in Ref. 26Poleev A. Wendler F. Fickenscher H. Zannini M. Yaginuma K. Abbott C. Plachov D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 899-911Google Scholar. The reporter construct Tg-CAT ABdel was generated by PCR amplification of a small portion of the Tg promoter (region C) and subsequent subcloning in SalI-HindIII sites of the same reporter plasmid of Tg-CAT. CMV-CAT and CMV-LUC plasmids were used as internal control in transfection assays. The DNA of all plasmids was prepared by Qiagen cartridges (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) and used for cell transfection. PC Cl3 and HeLa cell lines have been described previously (27Berlingieri M. Portella G. Grieco M. Santoro M. Fusco A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2261-2266Google Scholar). PC Cl3 cells were grown in Coon's modified F-12 medium (Seromed) supplemented with 5% calf serum (Invitrogen) and six hormones and growth factors as described by Ambesi-Impiombato and Coon (28Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Coon H.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1979; 10: 163-172Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transactivation experiments, cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/60-mm tissue culture dish, 5–8 h prior to transfection. Transfections were carried out with the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as suggested by the manufacturer. The DNA/FuGENE ratio was 1:2 in all experiments. Cells extracts were prepared after 48 h to determine either the levels of CAT protein with a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LUC activities as described previously (6Zannini M. Avantaggiato V. Biffali E. Arnne M. Sato K. Pischetola M. Taylor B. Phillips S. Simeone A. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3185-3197Google Scholar). Transfection experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times. GST-Pax8 protein was purified from BL21 (DE) LysS bacterial cells transformed with pGEX-Pax8. AtA 600 = 0.6, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm final) was added to the culture to induce the expression of the fusion protein, and cells were harvested 4 h later. Cells were resuspended in Lysis Buffer (1× PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors diluted 1:1000) and sonicated. 1% Triton X-100 was added, and the cell extract was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then subjected to affinity chromatography using glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After binding, beads were washed three times with Washing Buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT). GST-Pax8 was eluted with a buffer containing 10 mmglutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, for 10 min at 4 °C. The eluted protein was store at −80 °C. Protein concentration was judged from Coomassie Blue staining. For the synthesis of bacterial TTF-1 protein,Escherichia coli cells were transformed with pQE12-TTF-1, an expression vector encoding for TTF-1 fused to a His6 tag at the C terminus. The expression and the purification of TTF-1 protein were performed as described previously (46Aurisicchio L., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1477-1482Google Scholar). Pull-down assays were performed by challenging 4 μg of GST or GST-Pax8-purified proteins previously bound to glutathione-agarose beads with 3 mg of total protein extract prepared from PC Cl3 cells or HeLa cells. The binding reactions were carried out for 90 min at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, and then the beads were washed several times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and proteases inhibitors (from Sigma). The bound proteins were eluted by resuspending the beads directly in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 3–5 min. before loading on the gel. The co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed by incubating 2 mg of total protein extract with 20 μl of anti-FLAG-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The samples were then centrifuged, and the agarose gel-bound proteins were washed several times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and proteases inhibitors (from Sigma), resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 3–5 min before loading on the gel. Cells were grown directly on glass coverslips for 72 h, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized for 7 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated for 10 min in 0.1 m glycine in PBS. The coverslips were subsequently incubated for 1 h with a mixture of primary antibodies diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and, after PBS washing, incubated for 20 min with a mixture of fluorescein-tagged goat anti-mouse and rhodamine-tagged goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted 1:50 in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After final washings with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on a microscope slide using a 70% solution of glycerol in PBS. Primary antibodies and sera were monoclonal anti-TTF-1 Ab-1 (clone 8G7G3/1) from Neo Markers (Lab Vision Corporation) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Pax8 Ab187 (29De Vita G. Zannini M. Cirafici A.M. Melillo R.M., Di Lauro R. Fusco A. Santoro M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 97-103Google Scholar). Images were collected with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope, equipped with a 488 nm argon ion laser, a 543 nm HeNe laser, and a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil-immersion objective. Emitted fluorescence was detected using a BP 505–530 bandpass filter for fluorescein isothiocyanate, and a LP 560 long pass filter for TRITC. Pairs of images were collected simultaneously in the green and red channels. High magnification images were collected as 512 × 512 × 32 voxel images (sampling distance 110 nm lateral and 350 nm axial). We have examined the pattern of distribution of Pax8 and TTF-1 in PC cells by immunolabeling and confocal microscopy. The nuclear localization of both transcription factors in thyroid cells in culture has been already shown by indirect immunofluorescence (19Mascia A. Nitsch L., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 163-176Google Scholar). The two antibodies that have been used, Ab-1 (clone 8G7G3/1) against TTF-1 and Ab187 against Pax8, are highly specific as indicated by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Confocal microscopy examination of dual-labeled samples confirmed that the anti-TTF-1 (Fig. 1 a) as well as the anti-Pax-8 (Fig. 1 b) antibody stained only the nuclei, with the exclusion of nucleoli, and did not give any staining outside the nucleus. With either antibody the intensity of staining over individual nuclei varied significantly suggesting a different degree of expression of each transcription factor at the single cell level. At higher magnification (Fig. 1, d and e), it clearly appeared that both factors were not diffused within the nucleus but were instead localized in numerous interconnected nucleoplasmic domains, spread throughout the nucleus. The signals from the two immunostained transcription factors were acquired together, at high resolution, by line-wise scanning. It has been thus possible to determine that the patterns of distribution were quite similar and frequently superimposed, even though not identical, as inferred from the yellow output color (Fig. 1, c andf). In order to determine whether Pax8 and TTF-1 could physically associate, recombinant GST-Pax8 protein was purified from bacteria and used in pull-down experiments with total protein extracts prepared from thyroid and non-thyroid cells. In particular, we used the PC Cl3 cells as a source of thyroid-specific protein extracts and HeLa cells transiently transfected with an expression vector encoding for TTF-1 as a source of non-thyroid protein extracts containing exogenous TTF-1. Results of the binding reactions show that TTF-1 protein is specifically bound by GST-Pax8 but not by the unfused GST protein (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2and 4 with lanes 1 and 3). In addition, the binding between Pax8 and TTF-1 occurs both in thyroid and non-thyroid cells (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and4), suggesting that the molecular basis of this interaction does not require a cell type-specific mechanism. Note that TTF-1 in thyroid cells (PC Cl3 cell line, Fig. 2 A, lane 2) appears as two bands, although when the cDNA is transiently transfected in non-thyroid cells (HeLa cell line, Fig. 2 A, lane 4), only the higher molecular weight band is visible. The reason for this difference is still poorly understood. To investigate the possibility that Pax8 and TTF-1 interact directly, pull-down experiments were performed using the fusion protein GST-Pax8 and bacterial TTF-1 protein affinity-purified. The glutathione-Sepharose beads loaded with GST-Pax8 were indeed able to co-precipitate the bacterial TTF-1 protein (Fig. 2 B,lane 3), although the control reaction of beads loaded with the GST protein did not co-precipitate any protein (Fig. 2 B, lane 2). These results demonstrated that the interaction between Pax8 and TTF-1, already observed in pull-down assays with total protein extracts, is indeed a direct protein-protein interaction. To test whether the interaction observed in vitro in GST pull-down assays could be observed also in vivo, PC Cl3 thyroid cells were stably transfected with 3xFLAG-Pax8, an expression vector encoding for Pax8 fused to the FLAG epitope. Several independent clones were isolated, and the presence of 3xFLAG-Pax8 was determined by Western blot analysis using a specific anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (data not shown). We identified 4 positive clones out of the 10 analyzed, and the neomycin-positive clones that did not express 3xFLAG-Pax8 were used as control of the subsequent experiments. Anti-FLAG-agarose affinity gel was used to immunoprecipitate the 3xFLAG-Pax8 protein from total extracts prepared from clones 3xFLAG-P8-8 (positive clone) and 3xFLAG-P8-7 (negative clone). Subsequently, the bound proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis after separation by SDS-PAGE. Western blot developed with a specific anti-TTF-1 polyclonal antibody showed the presence of TTF-1 co-immunoprecipitated protein only in the extract prepared from clone 3xFLAG-P8-8 (Fig. 2 C). It was reported previously that in transient transfection assays in HeLa cells, TTF-1 is able to activate transcription from a reporter construct in which the Tg minimal promoter is subcloned upstream of the CAT gene (Tg-CAT (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar)). In contrast, in the same experimental model system Pax8 is a quite poor activator of the Tg promoter (18Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachv D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence indicate that Pax8 is a transcription factor strictly required for Tg gene transcription in thyroid cells (17Pasca di Magliano M., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13144-13149Google Scholar, 19Mascia A. Nitsch L., Di Lauro R. Zannini M. J. Endocrinol. 2002; 172: 163-176Google Scholar, 20Fabbro D. Pellizzari L. Mercuri F. Tell G. Damante G. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 21: 347-354Google Scholar). To test whether Pax8 and TTF-1 could synergistically stimulate transcription from thyroid-specific gene promoters, expression vectors encoding for Pax8 and TTF-1 were co-transfected in HeLa cells together with the reporter construct Tg-CAT, separately or in combination. The two transcription factors when transfected separately enhanced transcription from the Tg promoter, albeit to a different extent as expected (Fig. 3). Interestingly, co-expression of TTF-1 and Pax8 led to a marked synergism in the activation of the Tg promoter (Fig. 3). Moreover, a detailed analysis of the synergistic effect demonstrated that for the functional interaction between Pax8 and TTF-1 on the Tg promoter the ratio of the two transcription factors is crucial. It is worth mentioning that when a very small DNA concentration of both transactivators are used, it is possible to observe the synergism. In contrast, higher DNA concentrations still have the ability of activating transcription from the promoter but do not show the synergism any longer (data not shown). A clear dose-dependent effect was observed as reported in other studies (23Miccadei S., De Leo R. Zammarchi E. Natali P.G. Civitareale D. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 837-846Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that TTF-1 activates transcription via a functional redundancy of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar). To determine which of the two domains mediates the synergy with Pax8 in the transcriptional activation of the Tg promoter, we have used deletion mutants described previously (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar). The mutants, named Δ14 and Δ3, were transfected in HeLa cells together with the reporter construct Tg-CAT, in the absence or presence of Pax8. As expected, both mutants were able to activate the Tg promoter as the wild-type TTF-1 molecule (Fig. 4 A). However, we demonstrated that mutant Δ14 that contains the N-terminal activation domain and the homeodomain is able to synergize with Pax8 on Tg-CAT-like wild-type TTF-1 (Fig. 4 A). On the contrary mutant Δ3, which contains the homeodomain and the C-terminal activation domain, lacks the ability to exert the synergism with Pax8 (Fig. 4 A). Therefore, we conclude that even though in previous studies it was suggested that the two activation domains of TTF-1 were functionally equivalent, only the N-terminal domain of TTF-1 is able to synergize with Pax8. To map further TTF-1 N-terminal sequences involved in transcriptional activation with Pax8, we have tested additional TTF-1 N-terminal deletion mutants described previously (8De Felice M. Damante G. Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Di Lauro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26649-26656Google Scholar), such as Δ1, Δ2, and Δ33 (Fig. 4 B). As before, the mutants were transfected in HeLa cells together with the reporter construct Tg-CAT, in the absence or in the presence of Pax8. The results obtained for each of the mutants tested indicate that the sequence downstream from amino acid 51 in TTF-1 N-terminal domain is required for the synergistic activation with Pax8. In fact, deletion mutant Δ1 behaves as wild-type TTF-1 (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the region spanning between amino acids 1 and 51 is not essential for the synergy with Pax8. At the same time, mutants Δ33 and Δ2 show a progressively reduced ability in the cooperation with Pax8 (Fig. 4 B), thus indicating that the portion of the protein downstream from residue 51 is involved in the synergism. In order to test whether the different ability to synergize with Pax8 of mutants Δ14 and Δ3 was due to a different ability in establishing a protein-protein interaction, we have performed pull-down experiments with protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells transiently transfected with the expression vectors encoding for Δ14 and Δ3 mutants. Results of the binding reactions show that Δ14 protein is specifically bound by GST-Pax8, although Δ3 protein is not, thus demonstrating that the biochemical interaction is required for the synergism (Fig. 5). There are several reported isoforms of Pax8 protein (26Poleev A. Wendler F. Fickenscher H. Zann"

However, the downstream mediators of these responses, and the elements linking growth and proliferation, have not been fully elucidated. Rapamycin inhibits hepatocyte proliferation in culture and liver regenerationin vivo. In cultured rat hepatocytes, rapamycin prevented the up-regulation of cyclin D1 as well as proteins acting downstream in the cell cycle. Transfection with cyclin D1 or E2F2, but not cyclin E or activated Akt, overcame the rapamycin-mediated cell cycle arrest. Rapamycin also inhibited the induction of global protein synthesis after growth factor stimulation, and cyclin D1 overcame this inhibition. Rapamycin inhibited hepatocyte proliferation and cyclin D1 expression in the mouse liver after 70% partial hepatectomy. In rapamycin-treated mice, transfection with cyclin D1 induced hepatocyte proliferation, increased hepatocyte cell size, and promoted growth of the liver. These results suggest that cyclin D1 is a key mediator of increased protein synthesis, cell growth, and proliferation downstream of target of rapamycin in mitogen-stimulated hepatocytes."

Pregnenolone can then be directed to one of three principal pathways by microsomal P450c17, the qualitative regulator of steroidogenesis, which catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities (1Nakajin S. Shively J.E. Yuan P.M. Hall P.F. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4037-4042Google Scholar, 2Nakajin S. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3871-3876Google Scholar, 3Zuber M.X. Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R.

In the absence of P450c17,e.g. in adrenal zona glomerulosa and ovarian granulosa cells, pregnenolone is converted to 17-desoxy, C21 steroids including progesterone, corticosterone, and aldosterone. In the presence of the 17α-hydroxylase activity of P450c17, the adrenal zona fasciculata produces C21 17α-hydroxy steroids including the glucocorticoid cortisol. When both 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities are present, the adrenal zona reticularis and gonads produce the C19 17-ketosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA),1 which is the precursor of androgens and estrogens. The ratio of the 17α-hydroxylase to 17,20 lyase activities of human P450c17 is developmentally regulated. Adjusted for body size, the human adrenal produces nearly constant amounts of cortisol throughout life, indicating relatively constant 17α-hydroxylase activity (5Apter D. Pakarinen A. Hammond G.L. Vihko R. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1979; 68: 599-604Google Scholar). By contrast, the production of DHEA is minimal in childhood, rises 100-fold to levels that exceed the production of cortisol in young adulthood, and then gradually decreases with advancing age (6Orentreich N. Brind J.L. Rizer R.L. Vogelman J.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 59: 551-555Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which human adrenal C19 steroid synthesis is turned on (adrenarche) and turned off (adrenopause) remain unclear. Recent clinical observations suggest a link between premature exaggerated adrenarche and the polycystic ovary syndrome (7Ibañez L. Potau N. Virdis R. Zampolli M. Terzi C. Gussinye M. Carrascosa A.

Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2112-2118Google Scholar). Adrenarche is difficult to study because it occurs only in higher primates (10Cutler G.B., Jr. Glenn M. Bush M. Hodgen G.D. Graham C.E. Loriaux D.L. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 2112-2118Google Scholar, 11Smail P.J. Faiman C. Hobson W.C. Fuller G.B. Winter J.S.D. Endocrinology. 1982; 111: 844-848Google Scholar, 12Arlt W. Martens J.W.M. Song M. Wang J.T. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4665-4672Google Scholar), and no cellular model exists; instead, a productive approach has centered on the biochemistry of P450c17. P450c17 is a single enzyme encoded by a single gene that is expressed in both the adrenals and gonads (13Chung B.C. Picado-Leonard J. Haniu M. Bienkowski M. Hall P.F. Shively J.E. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 407-411Google Scholar, 14Picado-Leonard J. Miller W.L. DNA (New York). 1987; 6: 439-448Google Scholar). Like other microsomal P450 enzymes, P450c17 catalyzes several chemical reactions on a single active site by receiving electrons from the flavoprotein P450 oxidoreductase. Human P450c17 can catalyze the 17α-hydroxylation of pregnenolone to 17αOH-pregnonolone (17OH-Preg) or of progesterone to 17αOH progesterone (17OH-Prog). However, the 17,20 lyase reaction almost exclusively converts 17OH-Preg to DHEA; human P450c17 catalyzes the conversion of 17OH-Prog to androstenedione with only 3% of the efficiency of the reaction with 17OH-Preg (15Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar); thus most human sex steroids are made from DHEA. At least three factors influence the ratio of 17,20 lyase to 17α-hydroxylase activities at a post-translational level. First, high molar ratios of P450 oxidoreductase to P450c17 favor lyase activity (2Nakajin S. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3871-3876Google Scholar, 15Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar, 16Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Google Scholar). Second, cytochromeb 5 acts allosterically to foster the interaction between P450c17 and P450 oxidoreductase to promote the lyase reaction, but b 5 does not function as an electron donor (2Nakajin S. Hall P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3871-3876Google Scholar, 15Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar, 17Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 167-175Google Scholar). Third, the phosphorylation of P450c17 on serine and threonine but not tyrosine residues increases 17,20 lyase activity through as-yet-unidentified mechanisms, which may involve increasing its affinity for b 5 and/or P450 oxidoreductase (18Zhang L.H. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Google Scholar). The precise residues of P450c17 that are phosphorylated and the responsible kinase(s) remain unknown. However, when a protein is activated by phosphorylation there generally is an equilibrium between phosphorylation by a kinase and dephosphorylation by a phosphatase (19Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 180-185Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that PP2A serves as the principal phosphatase regulating P450c17 phosphorylation and 17,20 lyase activity. The NCI-H295A adherent population (20Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Google Scholar) of human adrenocortical NCI-H295 tumor cells (21Gazdar A.F. Oie H.K. Shackleton C.H. Chen T.R. Triche T.J. Myers C.E. Chrousos G.P. Brennan M.F. Stein C.A. La Rocca R.V. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5488-5496Google Scholar, 22Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Google Scholar) was grown on 150-mm Petri plates as described (20Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Google Scholar). Cells at 60–80% confluence were treated with okadaic acid, fostriecin, and cantharidin (Calbiochem, www.calbiochem.com). NCI-H295A cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 5 μg of the plasmids pBJF, pBJF-Flag-PP2A, pBJF-Flag-PP4, or pBJF-Flag-PP6 (23Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen, www.invitrogen.com) following the manufacturer's protocol. For in vitro labeling with 32P, NCI-H295A cells were transferred to phosphate-free medium for 1 h and labeled with 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 4 h at 37 °C. NCI-H295A cells were harvested and lysed by sonication (six times for 10 s at 30 kC s−1) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), containing 100 mm KCl and 0.1 mm EDTA. Unbroken cells, the nuclear fraction, and mitochondria were separated at 12,000 × g for 20 min, and microsomes were pelleted from the 12,000 × gsupernatant at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Microsomes were resuspended in the same buffer containing 20% glycerol and used immediately for enzyme assay. 17α-Hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activity assays were as described (15Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Google Scholar, 24Arlt W. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16767-16771Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (20 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C with 50,000 cpm of [3H]progesterone or [3H]17OH-Preg in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), and catalysis was initiated by addition of 1 mm NADPH. After the appropriate time (30–60 min), steroids were extracted in 500 μl of 1:1 ethyl acetate/isooctane and concentrated by evaporation under nitrogen. Concentrated steroids were dissolved in 20 μl of trichloromethane and analyzed by thin layer chromatography over silica gel plates (PE SIL G/UV, Whatman) using a 3:1 mixture of chloroform/ethyl acetate as a mobile phase. Radiolabeled steroids were quantitated using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences, www.amershambiosciences.com). Antibodies against PP2A catalytic subunit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., www.upstatebiotech.com), PP4 (25Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Van Hooser A., Hu, M.C. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Google Scholar), and SET (26Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Google Scholar) were covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose using disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce, www.piercenet.com) and mixed with lysates of NCI-H295A cells (4 μg of antibody/ml of lysate). The bound proteins were eluted, separated by SDS, 4–20% PAGE, immunoblotted with P450c17 antiserum (16Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2498-2506Google Scholar) (1:3000 dilution), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). NCI-H295A cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin. Recombinant catalytic subunit of PP2A was from Promega (www.promega.com); PP4 was prepared by immunoprecipitation from NCI-H295A lysates using antibody provided by Dr. T. H. Tan (25Zhou G. Mihindukulasuriya K.A. MacCorkle-Chosnek R.A. Van Hooser A., Hu, M.C. Brinkley B.R. Tan T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6391-6398Google Scholar). The activities of these phosphatases were confirmed against phosphorylated microsomal proteins by monitoring the release of free phosphate. PP4 and PP2A were immunoprecipitated and washed three times with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 500 mmNaCl. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in 100 μl of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2 at 25 °C for 30 min and pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes. The assay was terminated with 500 μl of Biomol Green reagent (Biomol, www.biomol.com), a phosphate detection reagent based on malachite green, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and read at 620 nm. One unit of phosphatase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 nmol of phosphate per h at 30 °C. For the in vitro PP2A experiments, microsomes were treated with 12.5 units/ml of pure recombinant PP2A catalytic subunit (Promega) at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 20 mm MgCl2. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 μm okadaic acid and 10 mm NaF and chilling on ice for 10 min. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to the catalytic subunits of human PP2A and PP4 were designed with 3′-overhanging thymidine dimers as described (27Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Google Scholar). Target sequences were aligned to the human genome data base in a BLAST search (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) to eliminate those with significant similarity to other genes. Web-based siRNA design software from Ambion (www.ambion.com/techlib/misc/siRNA_finder.html) was used for selecting siRNA sequences. Three target sequences for each gene corresponding to sequences located in the 5′, 3′, or middle regions of each transcript were synthesized and used for transfection (TableI). The siRNAs were synthesized using a transcription-based SilencerTM siRNA synthesis kit (Ambion, www.ambion.com). Transfection was carried out using the OligofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as described (28Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Google Scholar). In brief, NCI-H295A cells were grown to 50–70% confluency in complete medium without antibiotics in 100-mm plates. Cells were washed with serum-free medium prior to transfection. All the siRNA duplexes (2.0 μg/100-mm plate) were diluted in separate tubes with 100 μl of Opti-MEMTM (Invitrogen). In a separate tube, OligofectAMINE reagent was diluted 1:5 with Opti-MEMTM medium and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Diluted OligofectAMINE reagent was added to siRNA duplexes (50 μl of diluted OligofectAMINE reagent/μg of siRNA), and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The volume of medium overlaying the cells was adjusted to 7.5 ml, and the siRNA transfection complexes (200 μl) were added; 6 h later the medium was supplemented with serum to make a final serum concentration of 2%. Because of the slow doubling time of NCI-H295A cells (20Rodriguez H. Hum D.W. Staels B. Miller W.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 365-371Google Scholar, 22Staels B. Hum D.W. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 423-433Google Scholar), the cells were then incubated for an additional 72 h before harvesting for analysis.Table IsiRNA target sequences and siRNA duplexesPP2A (129)5′-AAATGTGCAAGAGGTTCGTTG-3′ (S)5′-AUGUGCAAGAGGUUCGUUGtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttUACACGUUCUCCAAGCAAC-5′ (395)5′-AATGTCTGCGAAAGTATGGGA-3′ (S)5′-UGUCUGCGAAAGUAUGGGAtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttACAGACGCUUUCAUACCCU-5′ (745)5′-AATTGGTGTCATGATCGGAAT-3′ (S)5′-UUGGUGUCAUGAUCGGAAUtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttAACCACAGUACUAGCCUUA-5′PP4 (91)5′-AAGGCCAGAGAGATCTTGGTA-3′ (S)5′-GGCCAGAGAGAUCUUGGUAtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttCCGGUCUCUCUAGAACCAU-5′ (537)5′-AATCGACCGAAAGCAAGAGGT-3′ (S)5′-UCGACCGAAAGCAAGAGGUtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttAGCUGGCUUUCGUUCUCCA-5′ (746)5′-AAGTGGCACTTCAATGAGACG-3′ (S)5′-GUGGCACUUCAAUGAGACGtt-3′ (AS)3′-ttCACCGUGAAGUUACUCUGC-5′Three target sequences (base numbers in parentheses correspond to the position in mRNA sequence) were identified for PP2A and PP4; the synthesized sense and antisense siRNAs are shown below each DNA target.

Full-length rat SETβ cDNA (29Zhang P. Compagnone N.A. Fiore C. Vigne J.L. Culp P. Musci T.J. Mellon S.H. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 613-624Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluebac His2Sf9 (Invitrogen) and transfected intoSpodoptera Sf9 cells for 48 h. Cells (50 ml of culture) were collected, washed, and lysed in 4 ml of 500 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) (buffer B) containing 1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm pefabloc, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The cell lysate was applied to a 250-μl Ni-NTA column previously equilibrated with buffer B containing 1% Tween 20. The column was first washed with 5 ml of buffer B containing 1% Tween 20, then with 5 ml of buffer B, and finally with 5 ml of buffer B containing 5 mm imidazole. The bound SETβ was eluted with 5 ml of buffer B containing 250 mmimidazole. Protein transfection into NCI-H295A cells was performed with Chariot reagent (Active Motif, www.activemotif.com). NCI-H295A cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown to 40–60% confluency. Purified SET protein was diluted with PBS (1.0 μg/ml), and Chariot reagent was diluted with water (1:20). In a separate tube, 100 μl of diluted SET protein was mixed with 100 μl of diluted Chariot reagent and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Growth medium from the cells was aspirated, and cells were washed with PBS. Transfection complex (200 μl/well) was added to cells; the volume was adjusted to 600 μl with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium, and the cells were incubated for 1 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). Cells were supplemented with 1.0 ml of complete growth medium, and incubation was continued for an additional 4 h after which the cells were harvested and used for experiments. Total RNA (1.0 μg) from NCI-H295A cells was converted to cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 50 °C, followed by 35 cycles of PCR amplification (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 90 s at 72 °C).

Gregory P. Sturgill T.W. Haystead T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 459-467Google Scholar). ATP-Sepharose matrix (0.25 ml) was washed three times with 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm NADH, 1 mm NAD, 1 mm ADP, 1 mm AMP, 1 mm DTT, and 60 mmMgCl2 (buffer A). NCI-H295A cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 1% Nonidet P-40; 5 mm EDTA; 2 mm EGTA; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 1 mm DTT; 0.15 mm Na3VO4; 10 mm NaF; 500 μm cantharidin; 1 mm NADH; 1 mm NAD; 1 mm ADP; and 1 mm AMP and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C; and 1 ml of the soluble fraction (1 mg of protein) was added to the washed ATP-Sepharose beads. After incubation for 4 h with agitation at 4 °C, the beads were washed 4 times with 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl, suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A containing 10 mm ATP, and incubated at room temperature for 60 min to elute bound kinases. Bacterially expressed human P450c17 bound to Ni-NTA-Sepharose was incubated with 1–2 μg of protein from the kinase-enriched fraction of NCI-H295A cells in the presence of 10 mm Mg-ATP. NTA-Sepharose containing 0.25–0.5 μg of bound P450c17 in a volume of 50 μl was incubated with 1 mm[32P]ATP (1.0 μCi) and 25 mmMgCl2 and washed 5 times with 0.5 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 500 mm NaCl. Bound32P-P450c17 was denatured by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer, separated by SDS-12% PAGE, and analyzed by PhosphorImager. The pCWH17-mod(His)4 expression plasmid containing the cDNA for modified human P450c17 (31Brock B.J. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1598-1606Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli JM109. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were grown at 37 °C toA 600 0.4–0.6; P450c17 expression was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 48 h, and P450c17 was purified as described (31Brock B.J. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1598-1606Google Scholar). In brief, spheroplasts prepared by lysozyme treatment of bacteria were lysed by sonication for 3 min at 30 kC s−1 and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet containing P450c17 was extracted with 1% Triton X-114 (Calbiochem) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. A reddish brown detergent-rich supernatant fraction containing P450c17 was isolated and passed over a Ni-NTA-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 20 mm histidine to remove nonspecific binding and eluted with 200 mm histidine. Further purification was carried out by hydroxyapatite chromatography to remove histidine and some other protein contaminants. Serine/threonine phosphorylation of P450c17 fosters 17,20 lyase activity, and dephosphorylation of P450c17 in vitrowith alkaline phosphatase decreases 17,20 lyase activity (18Zhang L.H. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Google Scholar). To determine whether a phosphatase participates in the physiological regulation of 17,20 lyase activity in vivo, we treated NCI-H295A cells with phosphatase inhibitors and measured 17,20 lyase activity (Table III). Okadaic acid (32Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar,33Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Google Scholar), cantharidin (34Li Y.M. Casida J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11867-11870Google Scholar), and fostriecin (35Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Google Scholar) are inhibitors of protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) and 4 (PP4) (36Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Google Scholar). Low concentrations of okadaic acid and cantharidin that are relatively specific for PP2A and PP4 increased 17,20 lyase activity 4-fold. Okadaic acid and cantharidin have some activity against protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (35Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Google Scholar), but fostriecin has IC50 values of 1.5 nm for PP2A (35Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Google Scholar, 36Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Google Scholar), 3.0 nm for PP4 (36Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Google Scholar), and 131 μm for PP1 (35Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Google Scholar), making it an essentially pure inhibitor of PP2A and PP4 (35Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Google Scholar,36Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Google Scholar). Concentrations of either 5 or 25 nm fostriecin again increased 17,20 lyase activity 4-fold, implicating PP2A and/or PP4 as the relevant phosphatases.Table IIIEffect of PP2A inhibitors on 17,20 lyase activity in NCI-H295A microsomesInhibitor% 17,20 Lyase activity ± S.D.Control100Fostriecin (5 nm)401 ± 75Fostriecin (25 nm)477 ± 87Cantharidin (50 nm)389 ± 64Okadaic acid (10 nm)450 ± 97bvPhen (50 μm)127 ± 34Sodium orthovanadate (1 mm)110 ± 11 Open table in a new tab The action of okadaic acid on NCI-H295A cells was dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect on lyase activity at 10 nm and a maximal effect at 100 nm, but there was no effect on 17α-hydroxylase activity (Fig. 2 A). Although it is logical to presume that the action of PP2A to inhibit 17,20 lyase activity was directly attributable to dephosphorylation of P450c17, it could also have resulted from an indirect protein-protein interaction. To discriminate between these two possibilities, PP2A was preincubated with various concentrations of okadaic acid. The okadaic acid-treated PP2A was added to NCI-H295A microsomes, and the 17,20 lyase activity was measured (Fig. 2 B). The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of okadaic acid was ∼0.5 nm, suggesting that catalytic activity of PP2A is required for its inhibition of 17,20 lyase activity. Preincubation of PP2A with 100 nm okadaic acid for 15 min before addition to microsomal preparations neutralized the effect of PP2A (data not shown), consistent with PP2A inhibiting 17,20 lyase activity by dephosphorylating P450c17. These values are consistent with the IC50 value of okadaic acid (0.1 nm) on purified preparations of PP2A or PP4 and those observed in cell culture treatments (10 nm) (32Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Google Scholar). Thus PP2A or PP4 appear to function physiologically as intracellular factors that de-phosphorylate P450c17, resulting in suppression of 17,20 lyase activity and sex steroid synthesis. To determine whether the induction of 17,20 lyase activity by phosphatase inhibitors correlated with the degree of P450c17 phosphorylation, we grew NCI-H295A cells in 32P and okadaic acid and estimated 32P incorporation into P450c17. PhosphorImaging of equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitable P450c17 showed that 10 nm okadaic acid promoted the incorporation of 32P (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, phosphatases affected by okadaic acid (PP2A/PP4) appear to play a role in the reversible phosphorylation of P450c17. To identify the specific phosphatases responsible for the effects of the inhibitor treatments, we treated steroidogenically active microsomes from NCI-H295A cells with PP2A and PP4 and assayed 17,20 lyase activity. PP2A (12.5 units/ml) inhibited 17,20 lyase activity to the same extent as alkaline phosphatase (12.5 units/ml), but PP4 (25 units/ml) had no effect (Fig. 3 A). This action of PP2A could be partially overcome by pretreating the PP2A with the phosphoprotein SET (7.8 nm), an inhibitor of PP2A (37Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11059-11062Google Scholar). SET alone did not affect 17,20 lyase activity (not shown). To determine whether PP2A was sufficient for removing the physiologically relevant phosphate groups, we treated NCI-H295A microsomes with PP2A (Fig. 3 B). Preincubation of microsomes with up to 12.5 units/ml of PP2A had no effect on the conversion of progesterone to 17OH-Prog (an index of 17α-hydroxylase activity), but PP2A decreased 17,20 lyase activity (conversion of 17OH-Preg to DHEA) in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal effect at about 0.5 units/ml and complete inhibition at 12.5 units/ml. Thus PP2A exerts the same selective effect on the steroid 17,20 lyase activity of P450c17 that we previously observed with nonspecific calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (18Zhang L.H. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10619-10623Google Scholar), but PP4 does not exert this effect. The presence of PP2A, PP4, and SET in NCI-H295A cells was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). PP2A shares 66% sequence identity with PP4 and 58% identity with PP6, indicating they belong to a related family of phosphatases (38Hardie D.G. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 109-120Google Scholar), and some inhibitors of PP2A also affect PP4 (36Hastie C.J. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 357-361Google Scholar, 38Hardie D.G. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 109-120Google Scholar) and might potentially inhibit PP6. To determine whether the action of PP2A on P450c17 was specific or simply representative of this family of phosphatases, we transfected NCI-H295A cells with expression vectors for the catalytic subunits of PP2A, PP4, or PP6 (23Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 827-832Google Scholar), verified the expression of these proteins by Western blotting, and measured 17,20 lyase activity (Fig. 4 A). Compared with cells transfected with an empty vector, the 17,20 lyase activity of cells expressing PP2A was reduced, whereas the 17,20 lyase activity of cells expressing PP4 and PP6 was unchanged. Thus PP4 and PP6 were unable to dephosphorylate the relevant resid"

Here, we report another Noc complex with a specific role in 40 S subunit biogenesis. This complex consists of Noc4p, which exhibits the conserved Noc domain and is homologous to Noc1p, and Nop14p, a nucleolar protein with a role in 40 S subunit formation. Moreover, noc4 thermosensitive mutants are defective in 40 S biogenesis, and rRNA processing is inhibited at early cleavage sites A0, A1, and A2. Using a fluorescence-based visual assay for 40 S subunit export, we observe a strong nucleolar accumulation of the Rps2p-green fluorescent protein reporter in noc4 ts mutants, but 60 S subunit export was normal. Thus, Noc4p and Nop14p form a novel Noc complex with a specific role in nucleolar 40 S subunit formation and subsequent export to the cytoplasm.

Here, we report another Noc complex with a specific role in 40 S subunit biogenesis. This complex consists of Noc4p, which exhibits the conserved Noc domain and is homologous to Noc1p, and Nop14p, a nucleolar protein with a role in 40 S subunit formation. Moreover, noc4 thermosensitive mutants are defective in 40 S biogenesis, and rRNA processing is inhibited at early cleavage sites A0, A1, and A2. Using a fluorescence-based visual assay for 40 S subunit export, we observe a strong nucleolar accumulation of the Rps2p-green fluorescent protein reporter in noc4 ts mutants, but 60 S subunit export was normal. Thus, Noc4p and Nop14p form a novel Noc complex with a specific role in nucleolar 40 S subunit formation and subsequent export to the cytoplasm. green fluorescent protein wild-type thermosensitive protein A Eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis is spatially organized into different subcellular compartments. Most steps in the pathway leading to mature ribosomes occur in the nucleolus, a specialized nuclear substructure, which includes transcription of the rDNA by RNA polymerase I, modification of the synthesized precursor RNA, and the assembly of both many ribosomal and non-ribosomal proteins with pre-ribosomal RNA (1Woolford J.L., Jr. Adv. Genet. 1991; 29: 63-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaethe resulting large ribonucleoprotein complex forms the 90 S pre-ribosome, which is split into precursor particles for the mature 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunit (2Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). During or after their maturation the pre-ribosomes leave the nucleolus, move toward the nuclear pore, gain export competence, and are finally exported into the cytoplasm. Some maturation steps like processing of the 20 S rRNA intermediate within the 40 S subunit and the association of a few ribosomal proteins to the ribosomes occur rather late, even in the cytoplasm (3Stevens A. Hsu C.L. Isham K.R. Larimer F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7024-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many factors known to be involved in biosynthesis and maturation of ribosomes were identified and characterized in S. cerevisiae(4Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 5Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This organism represents a well suited model organism to study eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, because homologues of the factors required are found in many eukaryotes. Of the more than 70 non-ribosomal proteins that participate in generation of ribosomes, most have been described to be required for modification of rRNA or removal of the external and internal spacer sequences from the precursor 35S pre-RNA. End products of the rRNA processing pathways are the 18 S rRNA, which is present in the 40 S subunit and the 25 S and 5.8 S rRNA, as well as the RNA polymerase III-encoded 5 S rRNA, which are the rRNA constituents of the 60 S subunit. Among the transacting factors involved to produce mature 40 S and 60 S subunits are nucleases, putative RNA helicases, RNA modifying proteins, and proteins associated with small nucleolar RNAs (4Venema J. Tollervey D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 5Kressler D. Linder P. de la Cruz J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7897-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) (see also www.expasy.ch/linder/proteins.html). Folding, processing, and maturation of the rRNA is coordinated with the association of ribosomal proteins, with the assembly and disassembly of transacting factors, and with the movement of the ribosomal particles toward the nuclear pore (6Kruiswijk T. Planta R.J. Krop J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 517: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 7Hadjiolov A. Cell Biol. Monogr. 1985; 12: 1-268Crossref Google Scholar). Different pre-ribosomal particles are generated, which differ in their sedimentation behavior on sucrose density gradients and in both their incorporated rRNA intermediates and (non-)ribosomal proteins. The 35S pre-rRNA, which is the primary rDNA transcript, is a constituent of the 90 S pre-ribosome. Precursor particles of the 40 S ribosomal subunit co-sediment with a size of ∼43 S and contain 20 S pre-rRNA, whereas 60 S precursors co-sediment with ∼66 S and contain 27 S or 25 S, 5 S, and 7 S pre-rRNA (2Trapman J. Retel J. Planta R.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 90: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 8Trapman J. Planta R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

The components associated with the different pre-ribosomal particles are thought to comprise the machineries required for ribosomal subunits formation and their regulation, as well as for quality control steps and for the movement of pre-ribosomes from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm. These protein complexes are transiently associated with nascent ribosomes. Recently, it became possible to purify large precursor assemblies employing (tandem-)affinity purification strategies under mild ionic strength using tagged non-ribosomal precursor subunits. Several 60 S and 40 S pre-ribosome intermediates could be isolated, which differ in their subunit composition (10Harnpicharnchai P. Jakovljevic J. Horsey E. Miles T. Roman J. Rout M. Meagher D.

Biochemical purification of a subnucleolar structure and development of visual screens helped to identify factors that couple 60 S ribosome maturation to the nuclear export of the precursor particles (16Fath S.

Recently, we have identified three novel nucleolar proteins that can be isolated in two heterodimeric complexes; Noc1p-Noc2p is associated with 90 S and 66 S pre-ribosomes in the nucleolus, whereas Noc2p-Noc3p assembles with 66 S particles throughout the whole nucleus (20Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E. Tschochner H. Cell. 2001; 105: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The dynamic interaction of the Noc proteins appeared to be crucial for maturation and intranuclear movement of pre-ribosomes leading to the mature 60 S subunit. A common feature of Noc1p and Noc3p is a conserved stretch of 45 amino acids, which is also present in a third yeast protein, which we termed Noc4p (20Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E. Tschochner H. Cell. 2001; 105: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Here, we analyze the properties of Noc4p and show that it is required for maturation and transport of the 40 S, but not the 60 S, subunit. Noc4p localizes to the nucleolus and forms a stable heterodimer with Nop14, which was recently described to be involved in 40 S subunit biogenesis (21Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3644-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Apparently, formation of different pairs of related Noc proteins represents a common theme in ribosome biogenesis; they participate in distinct steps of either pre-40 S or pre-60 S ribosome assembly, which is directly linked to ribosomal precursor transport. Yeast strains used in this study are given in Table I. Microbiological techniques, plasmid transformation and recovery, mating, sporulation of diploids, and tetrad analysis were done essentially as described (22Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A.

Noc4 with its authentic 5′ and 3′ untranslated region was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA using 5′144c1F-HindIII and 3′144c1R-KpnI oligonucleotides as primers. The derived fragment was cut withHindIII and KpnI and cloned into YCplac33 using the same sites, generating YCplac33-NOC4.

Strain NOC4 shuffle was obtained by transforming plasmid Ycplac33-NOC4 into strain BY4743. After tetrad analysis KAN+ URA+ spores were selected. Strain ProtA-NOC4 and GFP-NOC4were obtained by transforming NOC4 shuffle with plasmids pNOPPA1L-NOC4 and pNOPGFP1L-NOC4 and shuffling out of theURA3 containing vector using 5-fluoro-orotic acid. Functionality of these tagged version of Noc proteins was tested, and no growth defects were observed. Genomic integration of GFP1 or protein A in-frame with NOC4 and Nop14, respectively, was obtained as described previously (25Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A.

Briefly, 20 liters of yeast cultures were grown in YPD to A 600 of 1–2 (2 × 1011 cells), harvested by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold distilled water, resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5 ml/g of cell paste) (0.15 m Hepes, pH 7.8, 60% glycerol, 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Subsequent manipulations were done at 5 °C. After thawing the cells, the equal volume dilution buffer (0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.8, 20 mm MgCl2, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine) was added, and cells were broken with glass beads as described (28Flanagan P.M.

Glass beads and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Analysis of polysomes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as described (20Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E.

To disrupt the ribosomal subunits, cells were not incubated with cycloheximide before breakage, and cell breakage and sucrose gradient analysis were performed in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The plasmid pRS316-Rps2p-eGFP was obtained by replacing the RPL25 open reading frame with the RPS2 gene (29All-Robyn J.A. Brown N. Otaka E. Liebman S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6544-6553Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in plasmid pRS316-RPL25-eGFP (17Gadal O. Strauss D. Kessl J. Trumpower B. Tollervey D. Hurt E. Mol. Cell.

RPS2, which consists of the entire open reading frame plus 500 nucleotides of its 5′ untranslated region including the promoter region, was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the primers AAAAAAGAGCTCGCTTATTCACTAAGGATTCTTAAGGTTT and TTTTTTGGATCCGAATCTCTTCTTTTGAGCAGAAGCTTCA. The 1.3-kb PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI andSacI and cloned into the 5.9-kbSacI-BamHI cut vector pRS316-RPL25-eGFP. Complementation of the rsp2Δ disruption strain by the Rps2p-eGFP reporter construct was tested in the following way: a diploid yeast strain, which is heterozygous for the rsp2Δdisruption (obtained from Euroscarf), was transformed with pRS316-RPS2-eGFP on synthetic-dextrose complete medium lacking uracil plates, and subsequently transformants were sporulated. After tetrad analysis, spores carrying the rsp2Δ disruption and the pRS316-RPS2-eGFP plasmid were selected and tested for complementation by growth on YPD plates at 30 and 37 °C. Plasmids pRS315-RPS2-eGFP or pRS315-RPL25-eGFP were introduced into yeast cells by transformation and selected on synthetic-dextrose complete medium lacking leucine plates. Individual transformants were grown on SDC-leu plates for 4–5 days at 23 °C before transfer in liquid YPD medium and shift to 37 °C for the indicated times. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in water, mounted on a slide, and viewed in the fluorescent channel of a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. Pictures were obtained with a Xillix Microimager CCD camera. Digital pictures were processed by the Improvision software program (Open lab) and Photoshop 4.0.1 (Adobe).

Briefly, 20 ml of yeast culture were harvested and resuspended in 0.4 ml of buffer AE (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.3, 10 mm EDTA). 0.04 ml of 10% SDS and 0.440 ml of phenol (equilibrated in buffer AE) was added, and after mixing the suspension was incubated for 4 min at 65 °C. After cooling for 10 s in ethanol/dry ice, phenol and cellular material was spun down for 2 min at 14000 × g. The aqueous phase was extracted once with phenol and once with chloroform; RNA was precipitated by addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.3, and 2.5 volumes ethanol. 20 μg of the resulting pelleted RNA were resolved by denaturating agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) according to Ref. 23Sambrook J.

The cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1/5 volume of YNB complemented by histidine, lysine, methionine, and 2% glucose. Following a 5-min incubation at 37 °C, 10 μl of 5,6-3H-uracil (45 Ci/mmol, 1mCi/ml;Amersham Biosciences) were added per ml of culture. After 3 min the chase was started by adding unlabeled uracil to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml. Samples of 1 ml were frozen in liquid nitrogen just after starting the chase at the time points indicated. Total RNA was isolated from the cells by the hot-phenol method (32Köhrer K. Domdey H.

The short and conserved Noc domain (∼45 amino acids in length) is found in Noc1p and Noc3p, two nuclear proteins with a role in transport and maturation of ribosomal 60 S subunits. Interestingly, an uncharacterized yeast protein named Noc4p also exhibits such a Noc domain (20Milkereit P. Gadal O. Podtelejnikov A. Trumtel S. Gas N. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Mann M. Hurt E. Tschochner H. Cell. 2001; 105: 499-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To find out whether Noc4p is involved in ribosome biogenesis, we sought to characterize Noc4p, which is an essential protein of 63 kDa. Together with the other Noc proteins, Noc4p is enriched in the previously isolated large nucleolar subcomplex (data not shown) that contains many factors involved in rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis (16Fath S. Milkereit P. Podtelejnikov A.V. Bischler N. Schultz P. Bier M. Mann M. Tschochner H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 575-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Consistent with this biochemical data, chromosomally encoded Noc4p-GFP is located in the nucleolus (Fig. 1 A). Because Noc4p not only has the short Noc domain (residue 447–488 in Noc4p) but shows an extended homology throughout a large part of the Noc1 sequence (Fig. 1 B), Noc4p and Noc1p could perform a related function. Moreover, Noc4p orthologs exist in other organisms includingSchizosaccharomyces pombe and human (Fig. 1 B). Taken together these data suggest that Noc4p is a further member of the Noc protein family with a role in ribosome biogenesis. Previous work showed that Noc1p and Noc2p form a stable heterodimeric complex, which is associated with 60 S pre-ribosomes and required for ribosome maturation and nuclear export. When functional ProtA-tagged Noc4p was affinity-purified under the same stringent conditions that yielded the Noc1p-Noc2p heterodimer, another protein of ∼98 kDa was co-enriched (Fig. 2, lane 3). Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as Nop14p, which was shown previously to play a role in 40 S subunit biogenesis (21Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3644-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we generated a chromosomally integrated Nop14p-ProtA and affinity-purified it under the same stringent conditions. This revealed that the major band co-purifying with Nop14p-ProtA is Noc4p (Fig. 2,lane 4). Other bands found in the Nop14p-ProtA eluate were Noc4p or Nop14p breakdown products and heat shock proteins (possible contaminants). Notably, antibodies raised against the N-terminal domain of Noc2p detect Nop14p on Western blots, suggesting a structural relationship between both proteins, despite the fact that Nop14p and Noc2p do not exhibit an apparent sequence homology (data not shown). Taken together, our data show that Noc4p and Nop14p form a heterodimeric complex, reminiscent of the previously characterized Noc1p-Noc2p and Noc3-Noc2p complexes. Previous work showed that Nop14p plays a role in 40 S subunit biogenesis (21Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3644-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), yet Noc1p, which is related to Noc4p (see Fig. 1 B), is involved in 60 S subunit biogenesis (20Milkereit P. Gadal O.

Therefore, we sought to generate temperature-sensitive noc4 mutants to test them for defects in rRNA processing, ribosome formation, and nuclear export. Twonoc4 ts mutants, noc4–1 and noc4–2, which grow well at 24 °C, but not at 37 °C, were obtained (Fig. 3 A). The mutated noc4–1 protein has amino acid exchanges at position 283 (Ser → Pro), 344 (Ile → Val), 463 (Leu → Gln), and 550 (Val → Ala). Strikingly, the amount of free 40 S subunits significantly decreased in the noc4–1 mutant upon shift to the restrictive temperature, whereas the amount of 60 S subunits increased. In contrast, the noc1–1 mutant shows opposite effects with a loss of 60 S and an increase of 40 S subunits (Fig. 3, B andC). Similar results were obtained when a noc4 ts mutant was used that exhibits a mutation in the Noc domain (data not shown). To test whether and at which specific steps Noc4p is involved in the processing pathway leading to 18 S rRNA, the rRNA component of the 40 S subunit, we performed Northern analysis (Fig. 4,B and C) and pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 4 D). After a 4-h shift to restrictive temperature (37 °C), the total amount of mature 18 S rRNA was significantly reduced in the noc4–1 mutant, whereas the 25 S rRNA level remained almost unaffected (Fig. 4 C). Fig. 4 Balso depicts that noc4 ts mutants are defective in the pathway leading to mature 18 S rRNA but not to 25 S and 5.8 S rRNA; the 20 S pre-rRNA (the immediate precursor to mature 18 S rRNA) was significantly decreased in the noc4–1 mutant, whereas the35S pre-rRNA was more pronounced after shift to the restrictive temperature; in contrast, after an initial reduction briefly after the temperature shift, the amounts of 27 S and 7 S pre-rRNA (precursors of the mature 25 S and 5.8 S rRNA, respectively) raised again to wild-type levels (Fig. 4 B). To compare the precise processing steps that are affected in noc4 and in noc1 mutants, we used different probes complementary to certain regions of the rRNA transcript. The reduction in the 20 S, 32 S, and 27 S A2rRNA species in the noc4 mutants clearly indicates blocks at the early cleavage steps at A0, A1, and A2, respectively. Furthermore, an intermediate could be detected that corresponds in size to the 23 S product, a presumably aberrant species when processing at the early sites A0-A2 are blocked. Interestingly, this 23 S species was only slightly accumulated when compared with other yeast strains defective in 18 S processing. This could be because of a reduced stability of this intermediate innoc4 ts mutants. Appearance of the 27SA/27SB rRNA intermediate underlines that later cleavage steps st"

Previously we demonstrated that the GRIP domain of p230/golgin245 is specifically recruited to tubulovesicular structures of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Here we have characterized two novel Golgi proteins with functional GRIP domains, designated GCC88 and GCC185. GCC88 cDNA encodes a protein of 88 kDa, and GCC185 cDNA encodes a protein of 185 kDa. Both molecules are brefeldin A-sensitive peripheral membrane proteins and are predicted to have extensive coiled-coil regions with the GRIP domain at the C terminus. By immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy GCC88 and GCC185, and the GRIP protein golgin97, are all localized to the TGN of HeLa cells. Overexpression of full-length GCC88 leads to the formation of large electron dense structures that extend from the trans-Golgi. These de novo structures contain GCC88 and co-stain for the TGN markers syntaxin 6 and TGN38 but not for α2,6-sialyltransferase, β-COP, or cis-Golgi GM130. The formation of these abnormal structures requires the N-terminal domain of GCC88. TGN38, which recycles between the TGN and plasma membrane, was transported into and out of the GCC88 decorated structures. These data introduce two new GRIP domain proteins and implicate a role for GCC88 in the organization of a specific TGN subcompartment involved with membrane transport.

From the TGN, proteins are shunted into distinct transport carriers for transport to the plasma membrane, regulated secretory granules, different populations of endosomes, or earlier compartments of the secretory pathway (1Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A fundamental, unresolved question in cell biology is how the Golgi apparatus is formed and in particular how the TGN maintains a highly dynamic tubulovesicular structure and generates the diverse populations of TGN-derived transport carriers. A number of Golgi matrix proteins have been identified, for example GRASP55 and Golgin-45, which may be involved in the maintenance of the medial-Golgi structure (3Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 873-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Short B. Preisinger C. Korner R. Kopajtich R. Byron O. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Little, however, is known about a matrix associated with thetrans-Golgi responsible for generating or maintaining the tubulovesicular structure of the TGN (5Griffiths G. Simons K.

There is growing evidence that components of the Golgi matrix interface with components of the trafficking machinery (8Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 9Seemann J. Jokitalo E. Pypaert M. Warren G. Nature. 2000; 407: 1022-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Unique sets of accessory molecules dictate the budding of transport vesicles and their subsequent docking on specific membrane domains. Many of these proteins are peripheral membrane proteins that are recruited to the donor membrane in a highly regulated manner. For example, on the TGN the AP-1 adaptor complex is involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles whereas other heterotetrameric adaptors, AP-3 and AP-4, and the GGA (Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear homology,ARF-binding) proteins are recruited to distinct TGN domains involved in the formation of both clathrin and non-clathrin-coated vesicles (10Black M.W. Pelham H.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R460-R462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Robinson M.S. Bonifacino J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). However, the specific membrane association of many of these components and the basis for the domain-specific organization of the TGN is poorly defined. Recently we and others (12Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr.

Biol. 1999; 9: 377-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) have identified a family of Golgi coiled-coil peripheral membrane proteins in animal and yeast cells that contain a conserved ∼42-amino acid sequence at the C terminus, called the GRIP domain. The level of sequence identity between the GRIP domains is only modest; however, functional assays have demonstrated that a number of different GRIP sequences can specifically target reporter molecules to the Golgi apparatus. By analysis of chimeric green fluorescent proteins (GFP), the GRIP domain has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient for Golgi targeting in animal cells (12Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GRIP domain of one family member, p230, has been shown to target specifically to the TGN of mammalian cells (16Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In addition, we have also identified recently a coiled-coil protein with a GRIP sequence in protozoan parasites and shown that the GRIP domain was specifically recruited to the TGN in the trypanosomatid parasite, Leishmania mexicana (17McConville M.J. Ilgoutz S.C. Teasdale R.D. Foth B.J. Matthews A. Mullin K.A. Gleeson P.A. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 81: 485-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The identification of GRIP domain proteins associated with the TGN of this very primitive protozoan eukaryotic cell suggests that these coiled-coil proteins play a fundamental role in the organization and/or function of this highly dynamic Golgi compartment. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, only one coiled-coil protein with a GRIP domain has been identified. This protein, Imh1p, is a suppressor of a temperature-sensitive yeast strain that lacks a functional GTPase Rab6 homologue, Ypt6p (18Li B. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16813-16819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast a number of proteins with potential GRIP domains have been identified in mammalian cells, including the two characterized Golgi proteins, p230/golgin245 and golgin97. p230/golgin245 binds to the TGN in a brefeldin A-sensitive manner (15Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Erlich R. Toh B.H. Gleeson P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that endogenous p230 and a GFP chimera containing the p230-GRIP sequence binds to a subdomain of the TGN that forms highly dynamic tubular vesicular extensions that have the characteristics of transport carriers (16Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GFP-p230GRIP chimera has been shown to be associated with a population of in vitro generated vesicles that lack markers (β-COP, γ-adaptin, Rab6, and p200/myosin II) associated with other TGN-derived vesicles (16Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The extended coiled-coil structure of the GRIP domain proteins links them to the broader family of Golgi coiled-coil proteins known as golgins, which are proposed to function as molecular tethers in the docking of transport vesicles with a target membrane and in the maintenance of Golgi structure (21Chan E. Fritzler M. Elec. J. Biotech. 1998; 1: 1-10Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In addition to p230 and golgin97, data base searches also identified two other putative human coiled-coil proteins with GRIP domains, referred to previously as GCC1p (Golgi localizedcoiled-coil protein) and KIAA0336 (13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). By the analysis of GFP fusion proteins, the GRIP domain of GCC1p was shown to function as a Golgi targeting signal in transfected cells. The predicted GCC1p sequence was derived from a DNA cosmid sequence (g1572c101) and required prediction of exon/intron boundaries (13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The human expressed sequence tag sequence, KIAA0336 (GenBankTM accession number AB002334), is predicted to encode a coiled-coil protein of 1583 amino acids. The GRIP sequence of KIAA0336 has not yet been analyzed experimentally; however it is predicted to contain the highly conserved Tyr (or Phe) residues at positions 4 and 12 of the domain, aromatic residues that are essential for the GRIP domain to function in Golgi targeting. These findings raised a number of questions. First, are GCC1p and KIAA0336 bona fide Golgi proteins? Second, in view of the modest sequence similarity between GRIP domains, are the different GRIP domains localized to the same or different regions of the Golgi apparatus? Third, how many mammalian GRIP proteins are found in one particular cell type? Finally, do all the mammalian GRIP proteins have similar functions? In the present study we report on the full-length sequences of both novel human GRIP proteins, which we now call GCC88 (for GCC1p) and GCC185 (for KIAA0336), and demonstrate that they are both localized to the TGN in HeLa cells, along with the other two GRIP family members p230 and golgin97. Altogether, our data show that four different brefeldin A-sensitive GRIP proteins are associated with the TGN of mammalian cells. We further show that GCC88 overexpression results in a major perturbation of a domain of the TGN associated with the membrane transport of TGN38. Human autoantibodies to p230 have been described (22Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the myc epitope has been described (23Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). The P5D4 mouse monoclonal antibody that recognizes the VSV-G epitope was described by Kries (24Kries T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to β-COP were kindly provided by Dr. R. Teasdale (University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia). A monoclonal antibody to GFP, purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, was used at dilutions of 1/1000 for immunoblotting. Monoclonal antibodies to golgin97, syntaxin 6, GM130, and TGN38 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). For electron microscopy, a polyclonal anti-GFP (Molecular Probes) was used at 1/500 dilution. Sheep anti-rabbit Ig-FITC, sheep anti-mouse Ig-FITC, and sheep anti-human IgG-FITC were purchased from Silenus Laboratories (Melbourne, Victoria, Australia), goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red, goat anti-mouse IgG-Texas Red, goat anti-mouse IgG-Alexa Fluor 568, and goat anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 594 were from Molecular Probes. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig and porcine anti-rabbit Ig were obtained from DAKO corporation (Carpinteria, CA). HeLa, COS, and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were maintained as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 10% CO2. Stable HeLa cells expressing α2,6-sialyltransferase (SialylT) tagged at the C terminus with a VSV-G epitope (25Rabouille C. Hui N. Hunte F. Kieckbusch R. Berger E.G. Warren G. Nilsson T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were generously supplied by Dr. T. Nilsson and were grown in the above medium supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Transient transfections of cells were performed using FuGENE transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described previously (16Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). HeLa cell RNA was isolated using the RNAqueous kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (GeneWorks). cDNA was prepared from HeLa RNA using Superscript (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) (Promega) primer. GCC88 cDNA was amplified as four overlapping fragments that collectively spanned the entire length of the open reading frame predicted from the genomic sequence. Fragment 1 (bases 1–783) was amplified using the primers CCGGAATTCCACCATGGAGAAGTTTGGGATG and CGCGGATCCGCGCTGGGTCCTCTCCTCCTG. Fragment 2 (bases 715–1293) was amplified using the primers CCGGAATTCCGAGCAGAGTGACCATGCCTTG and CGCGGATCCGACATTGACATCCAGACTGGA. Fragment 3 (bases 1189–1798) was amplified using the primers CCGGAATTCCCGCATTCTGCAGCTGGAC and CGCGGATCCCTTCTCGGTGAGCACAGCTAG. Fragment 4 (bases 1729–2328) was amplified using the primers CCGGAATTCCCGCACACTGAAACTGGAG and CGCGGATCCTCATCTCTTGCCAGAAGG. Sequences 5′ to the predicted ATG start codon of GCC88 were amplified using the 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (Invitrogen). Each PCR product was subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pGEX-6P-3, except for fragment 4, which was subcloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), and both strands were sequenced using automated DNA sequencing. Fragments were then assembled into full-length cDNA using convenient restriction sites and cloned into pCIneo (Promega). GFP-GCC88GRIP, GFP-p230GRIP, and GFP-golgin97GRIP were described previously (13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 15Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Erlich R. Toh B.H. Gleeson P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A construct encoding the full-length GCC88 with a triple myc epitope tag fused to the N terminus was generated by subcloning the full-length coding region of GCC88 from pCIneo-GCC88 into pCMU-3xMyc (supplied by Dr. Rohan Teasdale). To generate a construct that lacked 279 amino acids from the N terminus of GCC88, pCMU-3xMyc-GCC88 was digested with BamHI andNdeI to remove an 885-bp fragment between the 3′ end of the c-myc coding region and the NdeI site within GCC88. Following Klenow treatment to fill recessed 3′ ends, the digested vector was self-ligated. The sequence encoding the C-terminal 82 amino acids of GCC185 was amplified from pBluescript-SK+-KIAA0336 (provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute) using the primers CCGGAATTCCTTGGAAAGGAATCAAGAG and CCGGAATTCCTATCGAAGTCCAGACCA. The PCR product was digested withEcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C1 (GFP-GCC185GRIP). The full-length 6.8-kb GCC185 cDNA was subcloned into pCIneo (Promega) using XhoI andSacII. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed using pGEX-6P-3 (Pharmacia). The sequence encoding the C-terminal 82 amino acids of GCC185 was subcloned from the pEGFP-GCC185GRIP plasmid into the EcoRI site of the pGEX-6P-3 plasmid (GST-GCC185GRIP). The sequence encoding the C-terminal 199 amino acids of GCC88, derived from a PCR product, was subcloned into the EcoRI/SmaI site of pGEX-6P-3 (GST-GCC88C199aa). Polyclonal anti-GCC185 antiserum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with the GST-GCC185GRIP fusion protein, comprising the C-terminal 82 amino acids of GCC185 fused to the C terminus of GST. The GST fusion protein was purified from a bacterial extract on a column of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) by the method described (22Kooy J. Toh B.H. Pettitt J.M. Erlich R. Gleeson P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20255-20263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit anti-GCC88 antiserum was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with the C-terminal 199 residues of GCC88. This immunogen was produced by first generating a fusion protein comprising the C-terminal 199 amino acids of GCC88 fused to the C terminus of GST (GST-GCC88C199aa). GCC88C199aa polypeptide was then cleaved from the purified GST fusion protein using Prescission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) and purified. Rabbits were immunized three times with 50–100 μg of immunogen emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant or Freund's incomplete adjuvant. A terminal bleed was collected by cardiac puncture 12 days after the final injection. Cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (15Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Erlich R. Toh B.H. Gleeson P.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1645-1654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and examined by confocal microscopy using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 imaging system. For dual labeling, images were collected independently to ensure there was no spillover of fluorescence between channels. Subconfluent monolayers of HeLa cells were detached by scraping into PBS and washed in chilled hypotonic-sucrose buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4), containing Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany). Cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic-sucrose buffer and passaged 20 times through a 26-gauge needle. Intact cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 2,700 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 2 °C for 60 min. The resulting microsome pellet was resuspended in hypotonic sucrose buffer. Equivalent proportions of each fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cell monolayers were treated with 5 μg/ml brefeldin A (Calbiochem) diluted in complete DMEM at 37 °C. Following treatment, cells were washed three times in PBS, fixed, and processed for immunofluorescence. Cell extracts were dissolved in reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk powder in PBS for 2 h. Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder and incubated on the membrane for 1 h, followed by three 10-min washes in 0.05% Tween 20/PBS. Membranes were then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies, as appropriate, and bound antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (20Gleeson P.A. Anderson T.J. Stow J.L. Griffiths G. Toh B.H. Matheson F. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2811-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunogold labeling, subconfluent monolayers of untransfected or transfected HeLa cells were washed with PBS and fixed with buffered 4% paraformaldehyde (electron microscopy grade; ProSciTech), containing 0.2m sucrose and then scraped from the dishes and resuspended in 10% gelatin and infiltrated with 15% polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (Sigma) in 1.7 m sucrose before snap freezing. Preparation of ultra thin cryosections and immunogold labeling were carried out as described previously (16Brown D.L. Heimann K. Lock J. Kjer-Nielsen L. van Vliet C. Stow J.L. Gleeson P.A. Traffic. 2001; 2: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sections were labeled with antibodies to GFP, myc, syntaxin 6, and GCC88, either singly or in combination. Rabbit antibodies were detected with protein A-gold conjugates (gift from Dr. J. Slot, University of Utrecht), and mouse antibodies were labeled with goat anti-mouse gold (British Biocell). NRK cells, grown on coverslips in complete DMEM, were transfected with myc-GCC88 24–36 h before treatment. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and incubated in serum-free DMEM containing 1.25 μg/ml mouse anti-TGN38 monoclonal antibody for the indicated time period at 37 °C or on ice. As controls, cells were incubated in either serum-free DMEM alone or irrelevant antibody (anti-VSV-G epitope monoclonal antibody P5D4) at 37 °C for 90 min. Monolayers were then washed four times in PBS and fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min. Cells were processed as for immunofluorescence and stained with sheep anti-mouse Ig-FITC, followed by rabbit anti-GCC88 and finally goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red. Previously, we established that the defined Golgi proteins, p230/golgin245 and golgin97, contained functional GRIP domains (13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Data base searches identified two other putative human proteins with similar GRIP domains that are predicted to contain extensive coiled-coil regions. One of the putative proteins was predicted from genomic sequences and referred to previously as GCC1p (Golgi localized coiled-coilprotein). We established that the GRIP sequence of this putative protein represented a functional Golgi targeting domain, as a fusion with GFP was efficiently targeted to the Golgi of transfected COS cells (13Kjer-Nielsen L. Teasdale R.D. van Vliet C. Gleeson P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 385-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As the predicted GCC1p protein was based on the sequence of a putative gene within the human genomic cosmid g1572c101 (GenBankTM accession number HSAC000357), requiring prediction of intron/exon boundaries, we have analyzed the sequence of this protein. cDNA clones of GCC1p were obtained by reverse transcriptase PCR using HeLa cell RNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 5′ sequence of the mRNA was obtained using rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Together the clones comprise 2522 bp, and an open reading frame of GCC1 cDNA spans an in-frame ATG initiation codon at nucleotide position 194 bp and a TGA termination at nucleotide position 2519 bp. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 775 amino acids with an expected molecular mass of 87.8 kDa (Fig. 1 B); therefore we now call this protein GCC88. A plot of hydrophilicity suggests GCC88 is a predominantly hydrophilic structure, with no evidence for a signal sequence or hydrophobic transmembrane domain, consistent with a peripheral membrane protein. Analysis of the sequence for coiled coils showed that a considerable portion (>80%) of the molecule had a high probability of assuming a coiled-coil structure, typical of other GRIP proteins. There are a number of interruptions in the predicted coiled-coil structure, suggesting GCC88 adopts a rod-like structure with periodic flexible joints. Non-coiled-coil regions of the molecule include a ∼75 residue segment close to the N terminus and the C-terminal GRIP domain (Fig. 1 C). The second putative human protein with a predicted GRIP domain was based on the sequence of an expressed sequence tag, KIAA0336, and is predicted to encode a protein of 1583 amino acids (calculated molecular mass of 185 kDa) with extensive coiled-coil domains spanning almost the entire length of the protein and a potential non-coiled-coil GRIP domain at its C terminus (Fig. 1 C). We call this protein GCC185. The lack of a signal sequence or transmembrane domain is consistent with it also being a peripheral membrane protein. In view of the low sequence similarity between the GRIP domain sequences (Fig. 1 A) it is important to determine whether the GRIP domain of GCC185 is a functional Golgi targeting sequence. The cDNA encoding the 200 C-terminal residues of KIAA0336 was isolated by reverse transcriptase PCR of HeLa cell RNA, and the sequence of the GRIP domain was shown to be identical to that found in the data base. We constructed a chimeric cDNA encoding the non-coiled-coil C-terminal domain of GCC185 (82 residues), which includes the GRIP domain, fused to the C terminus of GFP. COS cells transfected with the GFP-GCC185-GRIP construct showed targeting of GFP fluorescence to the Golgi region of the transfected cells, as indicated by the concentrated juxtanuclear fluorescence, with a similar staining pattern to GFP-GCC88GRIP and GFP-p230GRIP. Therefore, even though the sequence similarity between the GRIP domains is modest, the GRIP sequence of GCC185 is a functional Golgi targeting motif. To determine whether the two novel human proteins are bona fide Golgi proteins, we generated rabbit antisera to the C-terminal domains of either GCC88 or GCC185 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because the antibodies were generated to sequences that included GRIP domains, we were cognizant of the possibility for cross-reactivity of the antiserum with other members of the GRIP family. Therefore, we assessed the ability of the antisera to cross-react with GRIP domains of the other mammalian members of the family (p230, golgin97, GCC88, and GCC185). Fusions with GFP were analyzed to avoid cross-reactivity of antibodies with the GST. COS cells were transiently transfected with GFP constructs, and cell extracts were immunoblotted with the antisera. As expected, the antisera raised to GCC88C199aa reacted strongly to the 47-kDa GFP-GCC88C199aa, and importantly no cross-reactivity was observed with GFP-GCC185GRIP, GFP-p230GRIP, or GFP-golgin97GRIP fusion protein (Fig. 2 A). Blotting with anti-GFP antibodies demonstrated the presence of abundant levels of each fusion protein on the membrane blot (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, antibodies to GCC185 showed a strong reactivity to the 35-kDa GFP-GCC185GRIP fusion protein but no cross-reactivity to fusion proteins containing GRIP sequence of p230, golgin97, or GCC88 (Fig. 2 B). The band observed at 32 kDa with the anti-GCC185 serum, which does not correspond to sizes of any of the GFP fusion proteins, is nonspecific. Immunofluorescence of transfected COS cells was also performed to ensure the two antisera did not cross-react with other GRIP domains in native rather than denatured proteins. COS cells transfected with GFP-GCC88GRIP stained strongly with the anti-GCC88 antibody, and the anti-GCC88 staining co-localized with the GFP fluorescence, demonstrating that the antibody was binding to the GFP fusion protein. On the other hand, COS cells expressing GFP-GCC185GRIP, GFP-p230GRIP, or GFP-golgin97GRIP showed no staining with the anti-GCC88 antibody (not shown). Similarly, the anti-GCC185 antibody recognized the GFP-GCC185GRIP fusion protein in transfected COS cells but showed no cross-reactivity with the other three GFP-GRIP fusion proteins (not shown). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the anti-GCC88 and anti-GCC185 antibodies are specific for the proteins against which they were raised. Immunoblotting of HeLa cell extracts with anti-GCC88 antibody detected a single specific component of ∼ 105 kDa, an apparent molecular mass slightly l"
https://openalex.org/W2160260982,"Erbin contains a class I PDZ domain that binds to the C-terminal region of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2, a class II ligand. The crystal structure of the human Erbin PDZ bound to the peptide EYLGLDVPV corresponding to the C-terminal residues 1247–1255 of human ErbB2 has been determined at 1.25-Å resolution. The Erbin PDZ deviates from the canonical PDZ fold in that it contains a single α-helix. The isopropyl group of valine at position −2 of the ErbB2 peptide interacts with the Erbin Val1351and displaces the peptide backbone away from the α-helix, elucidating the molecular basis of class II ligand recognition by a class I PDZ domain. Strikingly, the phenolic ring of tyrosine −7 enters into a pocket formed by the extended β2-β3 loop of the Erbin PDZ. Phosphorylation of tyrosine −7 abolishes this interaction but does not affect the binding of the four C-terminal peptidic residues to PDZ, as revealed by the crystal structure of the Erbin PDZ complexed with a phosphotyrosine-containing ErbB2 peptide. Since phosphorylation of tyrosine −7 plays a critical role in ErbB2 function, the selective binding and sequestration of this residue in its unphosphorylated state by the Erbin PDZ provides a novel mechanism for regulation of the ErbB2-mediated signaling and oncogenicity."

A variety of proteoglycan functions are exerted depending on the GAG chains. These chains are usually highly sulfated, and can be classified into several groups including chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan sulfate, heparan sulfate (HS)/heparin, and keratan sulfate based on the GAG composition. HS has been shown to be involved in signal transduction and development together with certain growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrices. In Drosophila melanogaster, HS deficiencies caused by mutations in the genes encoding enzymes involved in the synthesis of HS result in abnormal developmental phenotypes (1Perrimon N. Bernfield M. Nature. 2000; 404: 725-728Google Scholar). HS has been demonstrated to bind to a variety of cell growth factors such as the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family molecules and to modulate their activities in various ways (2Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Google Scholar). Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and some interleukins (interleukins 3 and 7) bind to HS for efficient signal transduction (3Ashikari S. Habuchi H. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29586-29593Google Scholar, 4Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Adams D.H. Eto S. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1998; 110: 118-125Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that CS also plays various important roles in cell adhesion, migration, and recognition, especially of neuronal cells (5Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Google Scholar, 6Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Google Scholar, 7Zou K. Muramatsu H. Ikematsu S. Sakuma S. Salama R.H. Shinomura T. Kimata K. Muramatsu T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4046-4053Google Scholar). The sulfation profiles of CS vary with aging in the cartilage (8Plaas A.H. Wong-Palms S. Roughley P.J. Midura R.J. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20603-20610Google Scholar, 9Bayliss M.T. Osborne D. Woodhouse S. Davidson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15892-15900Google Scholar). Disulfated disaccharide units, CS-D (GlcA(2S)β1–3GalNAc(6S)) and CS-E (GlcAβ1–3GalNAc(4S,6S)), promote the outgrowth of neurites in rat brain (10Sugahara K. Yamada S. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2000; 12: 321-349Google Scholar). These reports suggest that HS and CS have different functions. Thus, it is of interest to clarify the mechanism for the biosynthesis of HS and CS, the molecules responsible for these diverse biological phenotypes. The initial stage in the biosynthesis of both CS and HS involves a linkage tetrasaccharide structure (GlcAβ1–4Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-), which binds covalently to serine residues of core proteins. To initiate the synthesis of HS, a GlcNAc residue is transferred to GlcA of the linkage tetrasaccharide with an α1–4 linkage. On the other hand, GalNAc is transferred to the same acceptor with a β1–4 linkage for the initiation of CS synthesis. Thus, because the acceptor substrate is identical, it is possible that the initiation enzyme for HS or CS synthesis compete with the acceptor substrate, i.e. the linkage tetrasaccharide bound to core proteins, in the cells. If this is the case, the initiation enzymes may play a key role in determining the species of the GAG chain, HS or CS, on the core proteins. After the initiation reaction, the addition of disaccharide units of GlcNAcα1–4GlcAβ1–4 are repeated for elongation of the HS chain, whereas GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1–3 units are repeatedly added for polymerization of the CS chain. For the synthesis of HS, five glycosyltransferase genes,EXT1, EXT2, EXTL1, EXTL2, and EXTL3, were cloned and their products characterized. They retain conserved motifs of short amino acid stretches in their COOH terminus and belong to one family. The EXT1 andEXT2 genes, which have been identified as tumor suppressor genes and were implicated in hereditary multiple exostoses, were found to encode HS polymerases having the activity of both β1,4-glucuronyltransferase (β4GlcAT) and α1,4-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (α4GlcNAcT) (11Senay C. Lind T. Muguruma K. Tone Y. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 282-286Google Scholar). Both enzymes are responsible for the elongation of HS chains. Three enzymes, EXTL1–3, exhibit only α4GlcNAcT activity, but their substrate specificities were different. EXTL1 showed α4GlcNAcT activity toward GlcA in elongation. EXTL2 showed activity in initiation. EXTL3 showed activity in both initiation and elongation for the synthesis of HS (12Kitagawa H. Shimakawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13933-13937Google Scholar, 13Kim B.T. Kitagawa H. Tamura J. Saito T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Sugahara K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7176-7181Google Scholar). Very recently, three glycosyltransferases, chondroitin synthase (CSS) (14Kitagawa H. Uyama T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38721-38726Google Scholar), CS glucuronyltransferase (CSGlcAT) (15Gotoh M. Yada T. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Mochizuki H. Inaba N. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Watanabe H. Kimata K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar), which are involved in the synthesis of CS, have been reported. CSS was found to be a CS polymerase having the activity of both β1,3-glucuronyltransferase (β3GlcAT) and β4GalNAcT. CSGlcAT or CSGalNAcT exhibits the activity of only one glycosyltransferase, β3GlcAT and β4GalNAcT, respectively. Furthermore, CSGalNAcT was found to exhibit apparent β4GalNAcT activity toward the linkage tetrasaccharide for the initiation of CS synthesis. Given the many enzymes involved in the synthesis of HS, it is easy to speculate that multiple glycosyltransferases would also participate in the synthesis of CS. In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a novelN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, CSGalNAcT-2, that is the fourth member participating in the synthesis of CS. In considering the substrate specificities of these two CSGalNAcTs in vitro, we suggest their differential roles in vivo. We performed a tblastn search of the GenBankTM data base using β1,4-glycosyltransferase motifs as queries and identified an expressed sequence tag with GenBankTM accession number NM_018590, which contained a partial open reading frame (ORF), but showed high homology to the carboxyl-terminal region of CSGalNAcT-1. An additional search of the Human Genome Project data base revealed that the genome sequence with GenBankTM accession number NT_008776 was identical to the expressed sequence tag. To obtain the complete ORF, the 5′-rapid amplification of complementary DNA (cDNA) ends method was employed using a Marathon ReadyTM cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Two reverse primers were designed for the 1st PCR: GP245, 5′-GTCAGGAAATCTGAACGATGCTGA-3′, and for the nested PCR, GP244, 5′-GCAGCTGTTAAGGAATTCGGCTGA-3′. The sequence of the DNA fragment obtained by the 5′-rapid amplification of complementary DNA method was determined using a DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Amersham plc, Amersham Place, UK). Finally, a cDNA sequence encoding the ORF was obtained by PCR using the Marathon ReadyTM cDNA of human bone marrow tissue (Clontech) as a template. The putative catalytic domain of CSGalNAcT-2 (amino acids 37 to 542) was expressed as a secreted protein fused with a FLAG peptide in insect cells according to the instruction manual of GATEWAYTM Cloning Technology (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). An ∼1.6-kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the Marathon ReadyTM cDNA derived from human bone marrow (Clontech) as a template, and two primers, 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCAAAGGTGACGAGGAGCAGCTGGCAC-3′ and 5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTCATGTTTTTTTGCTACTTGTCTTCTGT-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted into the vector pDONRTM201 (Invitrogen), then transferred into the expression vector pFBIF to construct pFBIF-CSGalNAcT-2 as described previously (18Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T. Togayachi A. Ishizuka Y. Nakanishi H. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12802-12809Google Scholar). A CSGalNAcT-1 expression vector, pFBIF-CSGalNAcT-1, was also constructed as reported elsewhere (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N.

The catalytic domains of CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 were expressed in Sf21 insect cells. A 50-ml volume of culture medium was mixed and incubated with anti-FLAG M1 antibody resin (SIGMA). The resin was washed twice with 50 mmTris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm CaCl2 and suspended in 100 μl of each assay buffer described below. The putative catalytic domain of β4GalT-7, β3GalT-6, or GlcAT-I was expressed as secreted protein fused with FLAG peptide in insect cells or COS-1 cells as described in detail previously (17Gotoh M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar). Each enzyme was purified as described (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar) and suspended in 100 μl of the glycosylation buffer described below. To determine the enzymatic activity, UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) (Sigma) were utilized as donor substrates. UDP-[3H]GalNAc (7.0 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For acceptor substrates, Gal-α-para-nitrophenyl (pNP), Gal-β-pNP, GalNAc-α-benzyl, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc)-α-pNP, GlcNAc-β-pNP, glucose-α-pNP, glucose-β-pNP, GlcA-β-pNP, fucose-α-pNP, mannose-α-pNP, xylose (Xyl)-α-pNP, and Xyl-β-pNP were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA) and Sigma. Chondroitin and CS-A, -B, -C, and -D were purchased from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). Chondroitin hexasaccharide and methoxyphenyl-linkage tetrasaccharides were kindly donated by Seikagaku Corporation. Oligosaccharides of CS and chondroitin were prepared as previously described (19Gundlach M.W. Conrad H.E. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 705-714Google Scholar). For the GalT assay, 14 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) containing 250 μm UDP-Gal, 12.5 mm MnCl2, and 500 μm of each acceptor substrate was used. For the GalNAcT assay, 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm UDP-GalNAc, 10 mmMnCl2, and 500 μm of each acceptor substrate was used. A 10-μl volume of enzyme solution for 20 μl of each reaction mixture was added and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for the GalT and 16 h for the GalNAcT assay. After incubation, the mixture was filtrated with an Ultrafree-MC column (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and a 10-μl aliquot was subjected to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS-80Ts QA column (4.6 × 250 mm; TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan). 0.1% Trifluoroacetic acid/H2O was used as a running solution and the products were eluted with a 0–15 (for GlcA-β-pNP) or 7–10% (for linkage tetrasaccharide-para-methoxypheny) acetonitrile gradient at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 50 °C. For glycosylated peptides, H2O containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 21% acetonitrile was utilized as the running solution. An ultraviolet spectrophotometer (absorbance at 210 nm), SPD-10AVP(Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for detection of the peaks. In the analysis of glycosylated peptide, labeling was done with Cy5 (AmershamBiosciences) and fluorescence was detected with a fluorescence detector, RF-10AXL (Shimadzu). For the analysis of elongation activity, the CSGalNAcTs reaction mixture containing 100 μg of chondroitin or CS and 40,000–55,500 dpm of UDP-[14C]GalNAc was used. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was filtrated and fractionated with a G2500PW column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) or Superdex 30 pg column (AmershamBiosciences). The radioactivity of each fraction was monitored by liquid scintillation spectrophotometry. A Xyl-bikunin peptide (VLPQEEEGS(-Xyl)GGGQLVT) was purchased from the Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled Xyl-peptide was incubated with 5 μl of three glycosyltransferases, β4GalT-7, β3GalT-6, and GlcAT-I, and 1 mm donor substrates, UDP-Gal and UDP-GlcA, at 37 °°C for 16 h as described in detail previously (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar). A 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm UDP-Gal, 1 mm UDP-GlcA, 10 mmMnCl2, and 500 μm Xyl-bikunin peptide was used for the reaction. The glycosyltransferases for the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide-bikunin peptide were inactivated by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Then, the reaction mixture was filtrated with an Ultrafree-MC column (Millipore), and a 10-μl aliquot was incubated with 1 mm donor substrate, UDP-GalNAc, and each CSGalNAcT at 37 °C for 8 h for the assay of initiation activity of each CSGalNAcT. The reaction products of CSGalNAcTs were filtrated with an Ultrafree-MC column and a 10-μl aliquot was subjected to reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on an ODS-80Ts QA column as described above. An additional peak detected by reversed-phase chromatography was isolated and analyzed by an electrospray ionization (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) MS (ESI-MS, esquire3000plus, and MALDI-TOF-MS, Reflex IV; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA). Then, 25 pmol of product was dissolved in 5 μl of H2O, and 45 μl of 0.1% formic acid and 50 μl of methanol were added. The product solution was infused at a rate of 3 μl/min with a capillary voltage of 3 kV. The hypothetical product peaks obtained by ESI-MS were analyzed by ESI tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). These analyses were done in both positive-ion and negative-ion ESI modes. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, 10 pmol of product was dried, dissolved in 1 μl of H2O, and applied. For the expression in CHO-K1 cells, the full-length cDNAs of CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 were amplified by PCR with primers CSGalNAc-T1, 5′-CCCAAGCTTATGATGATGGTTCGCCGGGGGCT-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCATGTTTTTTTGCTACTTGTCTTCTGT-3′, and CSGalNAc-T2, 5′-CCCAAGCTTATAAGAATGCCTAGAAGAGGACTGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGATCAACCAACAGCTTCACTGTTTGTC-3′. The amplified fragments were inserted into pcDNA3.1/hygromycin(+) (pcDNA3.1/Hygro, Invitrogen) after HindIII and XbaI digestion. The resulting plasmid, pcDNA3.1/HygroCSGalNAcT-1,-CSGalNAcT-2, and the pcDNA3.1/Hygro expression vector were transfected into CHO-K1 cells harboring pMEXneo-PG-FGF-1 that were expressing the syndecan-4/FGF-1 chimera protein (PG-FGF-1) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Medium conditioned by the CHO transfectant containing the secreted PG-FGF-1 protein with GAGs was collected. Fractionation of PG-FGF-1 using a DEAE-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and endoglycosidases: heparitinase (HSase), heparanase (HPase), and chondroitinase ABC (CSase) (Seikagaku Corp.) digestion and Western blotting with monoclonal antibody against FGF-1 (mAb1) (20Imamura T. Oka S. Tanahashi T. Okita Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 363-372Google Scholar) were performed as described previously (21Yoneda A. Asada M. Oda Y. Suzuki M. Imamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 641-644Google Scholar). The PG-FGF-1 bands digested by glycosidases were quantified by densitometric scanning of the digitized image using NIH Image (version 1.60) software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For quantification of the twoCSGalNAcT transcripts, we employed the real-time PCR method, as described in detail previously (18Iwai T. Inaba N. Naundorf A. Zhang Y. Gotoh M. Iwasaki H. Kudo T.

Standard curves for the endogenous control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs, were generated by serial dilution of a pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) DNA containing the GAPDH cDNA. The primer sets and the probes for CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 were as follows. The forward primer for CSGalNAcT-1 was 5′-GACTTCATCAATATAGGTGGGTTTGAT-3′, the reverse primer, 5′-GTCCGTACCACTATGAGGTTGCT-3′, and the probe, 5′-ACCTTTATCGCAAGTATCT-3′ with a minor groove binder (24Kutyavin I.V. Afonina I.A. Mills A. Gorn V.V. Lukhtanov E.A. Belousov E.S. Singer M.J. Walburger D.K. Lokhov S.G. Gall A.A. Dempcy R. Reed M.W. Meyer R.B. Hedgpeth J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 655-661Google Scholar). The forward primer for CSGalNAc-T2 was 5′-CTGACCATTGGTGGATTTGACAT-3′, the reverse primer, 5′-AACCGGAGTCCGAATCACAA-3′, and the probe, 5′-CATCTTTATCGAAAATACTTACATGG-3′ with a minor groove binder. PCR products were continuously measured with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The relative amount of each CSGalNAcT transcript was normalized to the amount of GAPDH transcript in the same cDNA. We determined a novel full-length cDNA sequence by the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends method and registered it in the GenBankTM data base with accession number AB079252. The nucleotide sequence and the putative amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. This cDNA sequence consisted of a 254-bp 5′-untranslated region, 1629-bp coding region, and 1791-bp 3′-untranslated region that contained a poly-A tail (Fig. 1). Although the original expressed sequence tag was obtained in a GenBankTM data base search with β1,4-glycosyltransferase motifs as query sequences, the full-length ORF sequence was identified as highly homologous to CSGalNAcT as previously reported by us (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar). We designated this novel cDNA as CSGalNAcT-2, and renamed the previous CSGalNAcT, CSGalNAcT-1. An alignment of CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 is shown in Fig. 2. A hydropathy profile of the putative amino acid sequence based on Kyte and Doolittle hydrophobicity plots indicates that the ORF of CSGalNAcT-2 encodes a typical type II membrane protein, which is consistent with the topology of other glycosyltransferases, with a cytoplasmic tail of 14 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids, and a large catalytic portion of 508 amino acids. CSGalNAcT-2 contains a DXD motif, which is conserved in many glycosyltransferases and functions as a key sequence for divalent cation binding, and a GWGGED motif, which is highly conserved among some of the β4GalT family.Figure 2Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences of CSGalNAcT-2 and CSGalNAcT-1 by GENETYX.

The genomic structure of the CSGalNAcT-2 gene was determined to be composed of at least 7 exons by comparison between the cDNA and genome sequences (Fig. 1). The exon/intron junctions of CSGalNAcT-2 were identical to those of CSGalNAcT-1 (data not shown). The truncated soluble forms of CSGalNAcT-1 and CSGalNAcT-2 were expressed in insect cells and employed for all experiments. On Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody, each enzyme was detected as a single band corresponding to the predicted size (Fig. 3 B). An additional band appeared by Coomassie staining at ∼50 kDa shared by all lanes (Fig. 3 A), however, the protein recovered from mock transfectants showed no activity for any donors and acceptor substrates (data not shown). At first, we screened the transfer activity of CSGalNAcT-2 using nine donor substrates and multiple monosaccharide-pNP acceptors. In screening of donor and acceptor substrates, CSGalNAcT-2 transferred a GalNAc residue to GlcA-pNP, however, no activity was observed with other combinations of donor and acceptor substrates (data not shown). It was identified in a previous report that CSGalNAcT-1 is β4GalNAcT, which transfers GalNAc to GlcA for initiation and elongation in the synthesis of CS (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar). So far, the linkage of GalNAc with GlcA has been identified only in CS. We considered that CSGalNAcT-2 was also a GalNAcT involved in the synthesis of CS, and performed further analysis using CS-related substrates as acceptors. Two kinds of GalNAc-GlcA linkages are known in CS, one in its polymer structure (3GalNAcβ1–4GlcAβ1-)n and the other between the polymer CS and the linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl). At first, chondroitin was utilized as an acceptor substrate to examine the elongation activity of CSGalNAcT-2. As shown in Fig. 3 C, CSGalNAcT-2 apparently transferred GalNAc to chondroitin to produce an additional peak (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 3 C) as a reaction product. This peak was isolated and identified to have GalNAc on its nonreducing terminus with chondroitinase ACII treatment (data not shown), the method used having been described in a previous study (17Gotoh M. Sato T. Akashima T. Iwasaki H. Kameyama A. Mochizuki H. Yada T. Inaba N. Zhang Y. Kikuchi N. Kwon Y. Togayachi A. Kudo T. Nishihara S. Watanabe H. Kimata K. Narimatsu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38189-38196Google Scholar). Second, a linkage tetrasaccharide (GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ-O-methoxyphenyl) synthesized chemically was utilized as an acceptor substrate to identify the initiation activity of CSGalNAcT-2. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the peak P appeared at a 30.3-min retention time in addition to the acceptor substrate peak (peak S) at 31.1 min. Peaks S and P were isolated by reversed-phase chromatography and their molecular weights were determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Peak S gave a molecular mass of 779.14 m/z, the same as that of the linkage tetrasaccharide with Na+ (Fig. 3 E). Peak P gave two peaks of 982.28 and 998.25m/z as shown in Fig. 3 F. The molecular mass of 982.28 or 998.25 m/z was the same molecular weight as a GalNAc-added linkage tetrasaccharide-O-methoxyphenyl with Na+ or with K+, respectively. Moreover, the peak P was identified to have GalNAc at its nonreducing terminus with chondroitinase ACII treatment (data not shown). These results suggested that CSGalNAcT-2 has two GalNAcT activities, i.e. elongation of chondroitin and initiation of the CS synthesis by transferring GalNAc to the linkage tetrasaccharide. In view of these results, CSGalNAcT-2 was suggested to be GalNAcT involved in the synthesis of CS as well as CSGalNAcT-1. To distinguish the functions of the two CSGalNAcTs, we compared GalNAcT activity toward GlcA found at the nonreducing terminus of various kinds of chondroitin-related acceptor substrates. The amount of enzyme was estimated by Western blotting, and approximately equal amounts of enzyme were used for the GalNAcT reaction. The results are summarized in Table I. Regarding the elongation activity, CSGalNAcT-2 utilized chondroitin polysaccharide as an acceptor more than any other substrate examined, and showed higher levels of enzymatic activity than CSGalNAcT-1 toward all substrates except for the linkage tetrasaccharide (Table I). Furthermore, CSGalNAcT-2 showed remarkably strong activity, compared with CSGalNAcT-1, toward sulfated substrates such as CS poly- and oligosaccharides (Table I). CS-A and CS-B, both of which are sulfated at position C-4 of GalNAc, were better substrates for CSGalNAcT-2 than CS-C, which is sulfated at position C-6 of GalNAc and CS-D, which is sulfated at C-6 of GalNAc and C-2 of GlcA (Fig. 4). CSGalNAcT-2 exhibited much stronger activity toward the longer oligosaccharides, prepared from chondroitin and CS, than toward the shorter ones. These results strongly indicated that CSGalNAcT-2 is much more active in the elongation of chondroitin and CS than is CSGalNAcT-1.Table IComparison of acceptor specificity between two CSGalNAcTsAcceptor substrateActivity (pmol/ml medium/h)CSGalNAc-T-2CSGalNAc-T-1Chondroitin Poly"

Whereas these pathways operate under different nutritional conditions, they all employ common machinery with only a few specific factors assisting in the choice of the delivery program and the membrane source for the sequestering vesicle. We found that the YKR020w gene product is essential for Cvt vesicle formation but not for pexophagy or induction of autophagy. Autophagosomes in the ykr020wΔ mutant, however, have a reduced size. We demonstrate that Ykr020 is a subunit of the Vps fifty-three tethering complex, composed of Vps52, Vps53, and Vps54, which is required for retrograde traffic from the early endosome back to the late Golgi, and for this reason we named it Vps51. This complex participates in a fusion event together with Tlg1 and Tlg2, two SNAREs also shown to be necessary for Cvt vesicle assembly. In particular, those factors are essential to correctly target the prApe1-Cvt19-Cvt9 complex to the preautophagosomal structure, the site of Cvt vesicle formation.

Autophagy is a catabolic process conserved among yeast, plants, and animal cells that permits the cell to eliminate unwanted or unnecessary proteins and organelles and to recycle the components for reuse (1Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). The organellar turnover is exclusively accomplished in the lysosome/vacuole lumen by a wide range of hydrolases capable of breaking down all cellular constituents (1Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). Autophagy plays an essential role during normal physiological processes such as starvation, cellular differentiation, cell death, and aging, but also in preventing some types of cellular dysfunction including cancer (2Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have led to the identification of a large number of molecular components that form the autophagic machinery (1Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these proteins are also utilized for the cytoplasm to vacuole targeting (Cvt) 1The abbreviations used are: Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; Apg, autophagy; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PA, protein A; PAS, preautophagosomal structure; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; tSNARE, target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; VFT, Vps fifty-three; vps , vacuolar protein sorting; vSNARE, vesicle SNARE; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SMD, synthetic minimal medium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid 1The abbreviations used are: Cvt, cytoplasm to vacuole targeting; Apg, autophagy; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; PA, protein A; PAS, preautophagosomal structure; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; tSNARE, target soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; VFT, Vps fifty-three; vps , vacuolar protein sorting; vSNARE, vesicle SNARE; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SMD, synthetic minimal medium; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid pathway (3Harding T.M.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These various processes operate under different nutritional conditions, but biochemical and morphological analyses have shown that in all cases the cargo material (precursor Ape1 (prApe1), bulk cytoplasm or a specific organelle) is sequestered by a cytosolic double-membrane vesicle (7Hutchins M.U. Veenhuis M. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4079-4087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Takeshige K. Baba M. Tsuboi S. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J.

The basic mechanism that leads to the formation of this structure, called an autophagosome, Cvt vesicle, or pexophagosome, is identical in all three pathways and it can be divided into five discrete steps: vesicle induction/nucleation, cargo selection/packaging, vesicle formation/completion, docking/fusion with the vacuole, and subvacuolar vesicle breakdown (1Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Euk. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 2Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. Science. 2000; 290: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (2901) Google Scholar). In the case of pexophagy and the Cvt pathway, the cargo may be specifically targeted to the sequestering membrane where it starts to be enwrapped by a double lipid bilayer. This process leads to the creation of the cytosolic double membrane vesicle. The completed vesicle docks with the lysosome/vacuole and successively fuses with it. In this way the inner vesicle is liberated into the lysosome/vacuole lumen where it is finally consumed by hydrolases. Cellular signals dictate the selection of the cargo material but also the size of the forming vesicle (9Baba M. Osumi M. Scott S.V. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi Y. J.

These shared factors and all the regulatory elements localize to a punctate perivacuolar organelle, also called the preautophagosomal structure (PAS), that is believed to be the formation site of autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles (24Suzuki K.

Most of the autophagy (Apg)/Cvt proteins are cytosolic and achieve their correct localization by interaction with other factors or by specific binding to lipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine or PtdIns(3)P (20Ichimura Y.

Several lines of evidence suggest that the source of the sequestering vesicles for autophagy and the Cvt pathway differ at least in part. For example, Aut7 is needed for nucleation of Cvt vesicles but not autophagosomes; Aut7 is needed for expansion of the autophagosomal membrane (12Abeliovich H. Dunn Jr., W.A. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1025-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Similarly, Apg1 appears to have different roles in these pathways; a catalytic function is needed for the Cvt pathway, but Apg1 may have a nonkinase role in inducing autophagy (28Abeliovich H. Zhang C. Dunn Jr., W.A. Shokat K.M. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). With the exception of the proteins interacting with the Apg1-Apg13 complex, the rest of the pathway-specific factors are components of vesicular traffic machineries (Table II). Autophagy, but not the Cvt pathway, requires the GTP exchange factors, Sec12 and Sec16, and the two COPII coat subunits, Sec23 and Sec24 (29Ishihara N. Hamasaki M. Yokota S. Suzuki K. Kamada Y. Kihara A. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3690-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). That seems to correlate with studies in mammalian cells indicating that autophagosomes are derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (30Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). However, the tSNARE Tlg2, the vSNARE Tlg1, and the Sec1 homologue, Vps45, are essential for the formation of Cvt vesicles but not for autophagosome biogenesis (31Abeliovich H. Darsow T. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6005-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). That is also true for three PtdIns(3)P-binding proteins, the two sorting nexins Cvt13 and Cvt20 plus the transmembrane protein Etf1 (23Nice D.C. Sato T.K. Stromhaug P.E. Emr S.D. Klionsky D.J. J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SNARE-mediated fusion events employ additional proteins called tethering factors that play a role essential in the specificity and coordination of those reactions (33Whyte J.R. Munro S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2627-2637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Pelham H.R.B. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 99-101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the fourth subunit of the VFT tethering complex that, together with Tlg2 and Tlg1, is required for a retrieval transport step back to the late Golgi that is essential for the recycling of the vSNARE Snc1, but also for the completion of Cvt vesicles. We also show that in the absence of those fusion factors, prApe1 and its receptor, Cvt19, together with Cvt9 are not correctly targeted to the PAS. The S. cerevisiaeknockout strains in the BY4742 background used in this study (ykr020wΔ, vps52Δ, vps54Δ,cvt9Δ, apg9Δ, vac8Δ,apg1Δ, vps4Δ, vps5Δ,vps27Δ, vps29Δ, tlg2Δ andccz1Δ) were from ResGenTM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). A vps53Δ homozygous diploid strain obtained from the same company was sporulated and dissected to obtain theVPS53 deletion in a similar background. The rest of the employed strains are listed in Table I. For YKR020w and VPS52 gene disruptions, the entire coding regions were replaced with either the URA3gene from Kluyveromyces lactis flanked by coliphage loxP sites or the HIS5 gene of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, using PCR primers containing ∼40 bases of identity to the regions flanking the open reading frame. Thevac8Δ::URA3 disruption cassette, generously provided by Dr. Lois Weisman (University of Iowa), was digested with AflII and EcoRI and the reaction mixture was then used to transform the vps52Δ strain. Double deletants were selected by verifying the absence of Vac8 in the cell extracts with anti-Vac8 immunoblots (18Wang Y.X. Catlett N.L. Weisman L.S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). PCR-based integrations of the triple HA tag and the 13 × Myc tag at the 3′ end of YKR020w, VPS52,VPS53, and VPS54 were used to generate strains expressing fusion proteins under the control of their native promoters. The templates for integration were pFA6a-3HA-TRP1, pFA6a-13Myc-His3MX6, and pFA6a-13Myc-TRP1 (35Longtine M.S. McKenzie III, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4086) Google Scholar). Normal prApe1 processing and vacuolar morphology were used to confirm the functionality of all genomic fusions. Strains were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone and 2% glucose) or synthetic minimal medium (SMD; 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic amino acids as needed). Nitrogen starvation was carried out in SD-N medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate and 2% glucose). YKR020w flanked by MfeI sites was generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pRS416-CuProtA vector (25Kim J. Huang W.-P. Stromhaug P.E. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

The new plasmid was called pCuPAYKR020(416). This construction was also transferred as aKpnI-SacI fragment into a pRS414 plasmid (36Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) creating pCuPAYKR020(414). All enzymes for manipulation of DNA were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Plasmids expressing PA (pRS416-CuProtA), GFP-Snc1 (pGS416), GFP-Ape1 (pTS466), CFP-Ape1 (pTS470), Cvt19-CFP (pCVT19CFP(414)), YFP-Aut7 (pRS414EYFP-Aut7), CFP-Aut7 (pRS316ECFP-Aut7), GFP-Cvt9 (pTS495 and pCuGFPCVT9(416)), YFP-Cvt9 (pPS97), and CFP-Cvt9 (pPS98) have been described elsewhere (24Suzuki K.

Cells from this preculture were then either grown again in YPD or nitrogen starved in SD-N medium for 3 h. 1 A 600 unit of cells was collected by centrifugation and proteins were precipitated with 500 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min. After spinning the samples for 5 min, pellets were washed once with acetone. Pellets were air dried, resuspended in 100 μl of MURB buffer (50 mmNa2HPO4, 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 3 m urea, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmNaN3, and 0.05% bromphenol blue), and heated at 75 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of 10 μl were loaded on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and after Western blotting, membranes were probed with anti-Ape1 polyclonal antiserum (6Klionsky D.J. Cueva R. Yaver D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Cells grown to early logarithmic (log) phase in SMD medium or shifted to SD-N for 3 h, were prepared for fluorescence and stained with FM 4-64 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (39Reggiori F. Black M.W. Pelham H.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fluorescence signals were visualized with the use of a Nikon E-800 fluorescent microscope (Mager Scientific, Dexter, MI). The images were captured with an ORCA II CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) with the use of Openlabsoftware (Improvision, Lexington, MA). Cells were first grown overnight in SMD medium, then diluted with YPD and grown for an 3 additional hours. 50 A 600 units of cells were harvested, converted to spheroplasts, and kept frozen. Spheroplasts were resuspended and Dounce homogenized in 2 ml of lysis buffer (40Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 15 min and 1.6 ml of supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of prewashed IgG Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were then washed twice with lysis buffer (40Siniossoglou S. Peak-Chew S.Y. Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), once with lysis buffer containing 300 mm KCl, once with lysis buffer containing 500 mm KCl, then once again with lysis buffer containing 300 mm KCl, and finally 3 times with the initial buffer. Finally, beads were heated at 75 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of MURB buffer. After SDS-PAGE and Western blot, membranes were probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For cross-linking experiments, spheroplasts were prepared as above but not frozen. Instead, they were resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate buffer (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 200 mm sorbitol, 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN)) containing 1.5 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (Pierce). Suspensions were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. To quench the cross-linker, 200 μl of ice-cold 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) were added and tubes were transferred to 4 °C for 5 min. Finally, 1.6 ml of ice-cold dilution solution (187.5 mm KCl, 6.25 mm MgCl2, 1.25% Triton X-100) was added and after Dounce homogenization, protein A affinity isolation was performed as above.

We identified the YKR020w gene in a genomic approach where nonessential gene deletions in the yeast S. cerevisiae were scored for a defect in precursor Ape1 (prApe1) maturation. Theykr020wΔ cells grown in rich medium accumulate prApe1, indicating a defect in the Cvt pathway (Fig. 1 A). Certain apgand cvt mutants that are defective in prApe1 transport under vegetative conditions are able to import the protein into the vacuole when autophagy is induced by starvation. For example, mutants specific for the Cvt pathway such as cvt9, vac8,cvt13, and cvt20 or mutants that block autophagosome expansion but not induction such as aut7 are able to mature prApe1 when shifted to starvation conditions (12Abeliovich H.

We examined processing of prApe1 in the ykr020wΔ mutant following induction of autophagy. The ykr020wΔ strain displayed normal processing of prApe1 when this strain was shifted to a nitrogen starvation medium (Fig. 1 A), indicating that autophagic induction is not impaired. A genome-wide approach for the identification of yeast protein complexes by mass spectrometry indicated a putative interaction between Ykr020 and Vps52/Sac2 (44Gavin A.C. Bosche M. Krause R.

https://openalex.org/W2087519729,"Phospholipase C epsilon is a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C that selectively associates with Ras and Rap small GTPases as a target. Here we explored the molecular basis of the Rap1- as well as Ras-mediated regulation of phospholipase C epsilon upon platelet-derived growth factor stimulation by using a receptor mutant deficient in its ability to phosphorylate and activate phospholipase C gamma. Following platelet-derived growth factor treatment, this receptor induces persistent activation of ectopically expressed PLC epsilon through activation of Ras and Rap1. The rapid and initial phase of the activation is mediated by Ras, whereas Rap1 is responsible for the prolonged activation. We further demonstrate that the CDC25 homology domain, which exhibits guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity toward Rap1, but not Ras, is critical for the prolonged activation of phospholipase C epsilon. Platelet-derived growth factor prevented the hematopoietic BaF3 cells containing the mutant receptor from undergoing apoptosis, and enabled these cells to proliferate, only when phospholipase C epsilon was expressed. Therefore, the phospholipase C signal is suggested to be critical for survival and growth of BaF3 cells."

LPP (LIM-containing lipoma-preferred partner) is a LIM domain protein that is localized at sites of cell adhesion and transiently in the nucleus. In various benign and malignant tumors, LPP is present in a mutant form, which permanently localizes the LIM domains in the nucleus. Here, we have investigated which regions in LPP target the protein to its subcellular locations. We found that the LIM domains are the main focal adhesion targeting elements and that the proline-rich region of LPP, which harbors binding sites for α-actinin and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP), has a weak targeting capacity. All of the LIM domains of LPP cooperate in order to provide robust targeting to focal adhesions, and the linker between LIM domains 1 and 2 plays a pivotal role in this targeting. When overexpressed in the cytoplasm of cells, the LIM domains of LPP can deplete endogenous LPP and vinculin from focal adhesions. The proline-rich region of LPP contains targeting sites for focal adhesions and stress fibers that are distinct from the α-actinin and VASP binding sites, and the LPP LIM domains are dispensable for targeting LPP to the nucleus.

Trafficking of signaling molecules between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments, for instance, has important implications for the magnitude and specificity of gene expression (1Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). An interesting recent development is the realization that adhesion receptors and their cytoskeletal partners can regulate this nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of signaling proteins. Specialized cell adhesion sites not only play an architectural role in organizing cell structure and polarity but also are dynamic units directly involved in communication via the nuclear trafficking capability of several adhesion site-associated proteins (1Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One such protein that may play a role in this process is the LIM-containing lipoma-preferred partner (LPP).1 LPP is a protein that is composed of an extensive proline-rich N-terminal region and three C-terminal LIM domains (Fig. 1 A) (2Petit M.M.R. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). LIM domains are cysteine- and histidine-rich double zinc finger protein motifs that comprise ∼55 residues, with the primary sequence CX 2CX 16–23HX 2CX 2CX 2CX 16–23CX 2C (where X is any amino acid) (3Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). The LPP protein localizes in focal adhesions, which are membrane attachment sites of cells to the extracellular matrix (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, LPP can be transiently translocated to the nucleus (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The nucleocytoplasmic distribution of this protein involves a nuclear export signal (NES) that resides in the proline-rich region (Fig. 1 A). At cell adhesions, LPP interacts with VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) via its proline-rich region that contains two VASP-binding (FP4) motifs (Fig. 1 A) (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, LPP also interacts with α-actinin at these sites via its α-actinin binding site located near its N terminus in the proline-rich region (Fig. 1 A). 2B. Li, L. Zhuang, M. Reinhard, and B. Trueb, submitted for publication. Although the molecular function of LPP is not yet known in detail, several characteristics of this protein suggest it has multiple functions in different compartments of the cell. LPP binding to VASP and α-actinin suggests that it has a role in certain aspects of cell motility and actin dynamics. VASP appears to have a universal role in the control of these processes (6Reinhard M. Jarchau T. Walter U. Trends Biochem.

In the nucleus, LPP harbors a significant transcriptional activation capacity residing in the proline-rich region as well as in the LIM domains suggesting that LPP is directly involved in the regulation of gene transcription (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In addition, LPP may play a role in the development of some benign and malignant tumors. In a subgroup of lipomas, which are benign tumors of adipose tissue, the LPP gene acts as the preferred translocation partner of HMGA2 and in these tumors, HMGA2/LPP fusion transcripts are expressed (2Petit M.M.R.

Kazmierczak B. Meyer-Bolte K. Tran K.H. Bullerdiek J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 22: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as in a parosteal lipoma (18Petit M.M. Swarts S. Bridge J.A. de Ven W.J. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1998; 106: 18-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In a case of acute monoblastic leukemia, the LPP gene acts as translocation partner of the MLL gene, and the tumor expresses MLL/LPP fusion transcripts (19Daheron L. Veinstein A. Brizard F. Drabkin H. Lacotte L. Guilhot F. Larsen C.J. Brizard A. Roche J. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 31: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All tumor-specific fusion transcripts that are expressed in the above mentioned tumors encode similar LPP fusion proteins containing AT-hooks (DNA binding domains) of the HMGA2 or MLL proteins followed by LIM domains of LPP. As we have shown before, these fusion proteins are mainly expressed in the nucleus (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As LPP appears to execute different functions depending on its intracellular localization, in focal adhesions or in the nucleus, targeting of LPP to these intracellular compartments is expected to be crucial for the differential functioning of this protein. It is possible that LPP may contribute to the tumorigenic process when its targeting is deregulated. To date however, little is known about the parts of LPP that target the protein to focal adhesions or to the nucleus. To obtain more insight into this matter, we made a variety of GFP-LPP fusion constructs containing either full-length LPP molecules or a number of mutated forms there off. We investigated the intracellular distribution of these chimeras. In this way, we were able to identify distinct regions in the LPP protein as key regulators of the subcellular distribution of LPP. Plasmids for the expression of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged parts of the human LPP protein were made by subcloning the appropriate PCR products in the EcoRI andPstI sites of the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). The plasmid for the expression of GFP-tagged full-length LPP was described before (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Plasmids for the expression of GFP-tagged human zyxin, GFP-tagged human TRIP6, and GFP-tagged mouse ajuba were made by cloning the appropriate cDNAs into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (for zyxin), in the SmaI site of the pEGFP-C2 vector (for TRIP6), or in the BglII and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C1 vector (for ajuba). Plasmids for the expression of N-terminal GFP-tagged and C-terminal β-galactosidase (βGAL)-tagged parts of LPP were made by subcloning the appropriate PCR products in the NheI and XbaI (or SacII) sites of the pHM830 vector (20Sorg G. Stamminger T. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pHM840 construct has been described before (20Sorg G. Stamminger T. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 858-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). LPP constructs containing mutations or small internal deletions were made by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the supplier's instructions. All PCR amplifications were done with the Pwo DNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All synthetic mutations and PCR-amplified regions were verified by sequencing. Cell lines used in this work included CV-1 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast cells; ATCC CCL-70), NIH/3T3 (mouse embryonal fibroblast cells; ATCC CRL-1658), and 293T (human embryonal kidney epithelial cells containing SV40 T-antigen). Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator. Transient transfections were performed using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were grown on glass coverslides (coated with fibronectin in case of NIH/3T3 cells) to 50–60% confluency in 24-well plates. For each transfection 1.5 μl of FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent in 50 μl of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) was added to 0.5 μg of DNA and incubated at room temperature for 20 min after which the mixture was applied directly to the growth medium of the cells. Cells were incubated further at 37 °C for 18–24 h before analysis. Expression of GFP-tagged and GFP-β-galactosidase-tagged proteins was verified by Western blotting using a polyclonal rabbit anti-GFP antibody, dilution 1:5000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell extracts from transfected cells in 24-well plates were prepared by washing the cells three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by direct lysis in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 12% glycerol, 4% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol). 25 μl of each cell extract were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and were loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After size-separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PROTEAN nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). ECL Western blotting was performed using Renaissance Western blotting detection reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the supplier's instructions. In Fig. 7 A, a rabbit polyclonal anti-LPP antibody MP2 was used for ECL Western blotting at a dilution of 1:3000. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 min followed by three washes in PBS containing 0.9 mmCaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2(PBS2+). Quenching was performed by incubating the cells for 10 min at room temperature in PBS2+ containing 50 mm NH4Cl. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 30 min at room temperature. After washing the cells three times in PBS2+, bound primary antibodies were detected with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Following three washes in PBS2+, slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). For detection of GFP fluorescence, cells were fixed and thereafter directly mounted. Slides were analyzed on a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled digital CCD camera system (Photometrics) using SmartCaptureTM software. Primary antibodies used included rabbit polyclonal anti-LPP antibody MP2, dilution 1:200 (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and a mouse monoclonal anti-vinculin antibody hVIN-1, dilution 1:400 (Sigma). As outlined above, certain benign tumors express HMGA2/LPP fusion transcripts encoding HMGA2/LPP fusion proteins. These proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In lipomas, two different fusion transcripts are found encoding HMGA2/LPP fusion proteins composed of the three DNA binding domains of HMGA2 followed by either the two most C-terminal LIM domains of LPP (HMGA2/LPP-short) or a portion of the proline-rich region (amino acids 372–413) and all three LIM domains of LPP (HMGA2/LPP-long) (2Petit M.M.R. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 118-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Our previous observations show that when GFP-tagged forms of these HMGA2/LPP fusion proteins are overexpressed in cells, both forms are expressed only in the nucleus (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, in cells expressing very high levels of HMGA2/LPP-long, this protein is also present in the cytoplasm and in focal adhesions while in cells expressing similar levels of HMGA2/LPP-short, staining in focal adhesions is not observed (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These observations were the first indication that the LIM domains of LPP could play a role in targeting the LPP protein to focal adhesions. To investigate the role of the LIM domains in targeting the LPP protein to focal adhesions, we made a number of GFP fusion proteins containing full-length LPP molecules carrying mutations in one or two of its LIM domains (Fig. 1 B). The mutations in the LIM domains were made in such a way that these domains were completely destroyed: four of eight conserved zinc-binding cysteine and histidine residues were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1 C). We compared the intracellular distribution of these mutant LPP molecules to that of the wild-type protein also expressed as a GFP fusion protein (Fig. 1 B). The distribution of the GFP-tagged wild-type LPP protein is indistinguishable from that of the endogenous protein: GFP-LPP is highly concentrated in focal adhesions and, at steady state, only very low levels of the protein can be detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1, D and D′, and our previous observations, Ref. 5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Mutations in any of the LPP LIM domains resulted in a reduction of the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LPP protein (Fig. 1,E–G and E′–G′). The amount of reduction was different depending on which of the LIM domains was targeted by mutations. While mutations in the third LIM domain caused a minor reduction in focal adhesion targeting capacity (Fig. 1, Gand G′), mutations in the first LIM domain caused a more severe reduction (Fig. 1, E and E′), and mutations in the second LIM domain caused the most severe reduction (Fig. 1,F and F′). When two of the LPP LIM domains were targeted by mutations at the same time, a severe reduction in focal adhesion targeting capacity was observed in all possible cases (Fig. 1,H–J and H′–J′). Mutations in the second and third LIM domain (Fig. 1, I and I′), or in the first and the third LIM domain (Fig. 1, J and J′) reduced the level of LPP in focal adhesions in a similar way as when the second LIM domain was mutated. The most severe phenotype was observed when the first and second LIM domains were mutated at the same time. In this case, focal adhesion targeting of the LPP protein was almost completely abolished (Fig. 1, H and H′). In conclusion, our results suggest that the LIM domains of LPP play an important role in targeting the LPP protein to focal adhesions. LPP is a member of a family of proteins, which are all proline-rich in their N-terminal region and have three LIM domains in their C-terminal region. LPP family members include zyxin (10Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1679-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), TRIP6 (21Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), ajuba (22Goyal R.K. Lin P. Kanungo J. Payne A.S. Muslin A.J. Longmore G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4379-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and LIMD1 (23Kiss H. Kedra D. Yang Y. Kost-Alimova M. Kiss C. O'Brien K.P. Fransson I. Klein G. Imreh S. Dumanski J.P. Hum Genet. 1999; 105: 552-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). While all family members are quite similar in their C-terminal LIM domains, there is only limited similarity in their proline-rich regions. The LPP protein contains regions similar to zyxin near the N terminus (the α-actinin binding site) (Fig. 2, A andB), TRIP6 in the center of the proline-rich region (Fig. 2,A and C), and a region similar to zyxin, TRIP6, and LIMD1 at the C terminus of the proline-rich region (Fig. 2,A and D). Recently, it was shown that when human or chicken zyxin lacking their α-actinin binding site are expressed as fusion proteins with GFP, targeting to focal adhesions is grossly impaired (14Nix D.A.

We investigated whether this region has the same function in targeting LPP to focal adhesions as it has in zyxin. For this purpose, we made a construct expressing a GFP-LPP protein containing a deletion of its α-actinin binding site (GFP-LPPΔ41–57) (Fig. 2, A andB). However, no difference in focal adhesion targeting could be detected between the mutant LPP protein and the wild-type protein (Fig. 2, E and E′). We also investigated whether deletion of the TRIP6 similar region or the zyxin/TRIP6/LIMD1 similar region in LPP has an influence on the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LPP protein. The function of the TRIP6 similar region is not known, either in LPP or in TRIP6. The zyxin/TRIP6/LIMD1 similar region contains a nuclear export signal (NES) in zyxin (26Nix D.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1139-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In LPP, the function of this region is not known. According to our previous results (5Petit M.M. Fradelizi J. Golsteyn R.M. Ayoubi T.A. Menichi B. Louvard D. Van de Ven W.J. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Fig. 2, G andG′, it does not function as a NES in LPP. No difference in focal adhesion targeting could be detected between the wild-type protein and mutant GFP-LPP proteins containing a deletion of the TRIP6 similar region (GFP-LPPΔ205–230) (Fig. 2, A,C, F, and F′) or a deletion of the zyxin/TRIP6/LIMD1 similar region (GFP-LPPΔ387–408) (Fig. 2,A, D, G, and G′). In conclusion, none of the similar regions in the proline-rich region of LPP are important for the focal adhesion targeting of LPP. To obtain more insight into how the LIM domains of LPP function to target LPP to focal adhesions, we deleted the entire proline-rich region of the protein. In this way, we were able to investigate the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LIM domains as a separate entity. We made a construct expressing a GFP fusion protein containing all three LIM domains of LPP (Fig. 3 A). In CV-1 cells, this GFP-LPP-(412–612) protein displayed robust targeting to focal adhesions (Fig. 3, B and B′). However, staining in focal adhesions was not as strong as the staining obtained with the full-length wild-type LPP protein. These observations indicate that targeting of the LIM domains to focal adhesions is not as powerful as for the full-length protein. This suggests that also the proline-rich region of LPP might have a function in targeting the protein to focal adhesions. To further analyze the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LPP LIM domains, we investigated the targeting capacity of paired LIM domains and individual LIM domains of LPP. To do so, we made a number of constructs expressing GFP fusions containing LIM domains 1 and 2 (GFP-LPP-(412–531)), LIM domains 2 and 3 (GFP-LPP-(471–612)), LIM domain 1 (GFP-LPP-(412–473)), LIM domain 2 (GFP-LPP-(471–531)), or LIM domain 3 (GFP-LPP-(531–612)) (Fig. 3 A). Upon expression in CV-1 cells of these GFP-LPP fusion proteins, important observations could be made (Fig. 3, C–G and C′–G′). In contrast to the GFP-LPP protein containing all three LIM domains of LPP, which had strong focal adhesion targeting, paired LIM domains, either LIM 1 and 2, or LIM 2 and 3, as well as each individual LIM domain showed a drastic reduction in their focal adhesion targeting capacity. These results suggest that the three LIM domains of LPP cooperate to provide robust targeting of LPP to focal adhesions. The above-mentioned results on the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LIM domains of LPP, as compared with the complete LPP protein, suggested that the proline-rich region of LPP also has a function in targeting the protein to focal adhesions. To confirm these results, we made a construct expressing a GFP-LPP protein containing only the proline-rich region, lacking all three LIM domains (GFP-LPP-(2–415)) (Fig. 4). CV-1 cells expressing this protein presented staining in focal adhesions indicating that the proline-rich region of LPP has focal adhesion targeting capacity (Fig. 5, A and A′). However, whereas the strength of focal adhesion targeting capacity of the LIM domains was comparable to that of the full-length protein, the targeting capacity of the proline-rich region, although clearly detectable, was found to be much weaker.Figure 5The LPP proline-rich region harbors targeting capacity for focal adhesions and stress fibers. CV-1 cells transiently transfected with constructs expressing GFP-LPP-(2–415) (A, A′), GFP-LPP-(62–415) (B,B′), GFP-LPP-(94–415) (C, C′), GFP-LPP-(94–258) (D, D′, E,E′), GFP-LPP-(94–258)Δ(205–230) (F,F′, G, G′), GFP-LPP-(179–415) (H, H′), GFP-LPP-(179–415)Δ(205–230) (I, I′). Cells were fixed and labeled for vinculin. Cells were visualized either for GFP (A–I) or vinculin (A′–I′).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To narrow down the area in the proline-rich region responsible for its focal adhesion targeting capacity, we made several deletion constructs of the proline-rich region of LPP as depicted in Fig. 4. In this way, we were able to study the effect of deletions in the proline-rich region as a separate entity, isolated from the strong focal adhesion targeting effect of the LIM domains. We first deleted the α-actinin binding site in LPP (GFP-LPP-(62–415)), because α-actinin is known to be a component of focal adhesion sites and as such could provide a docking site for the proline-rich region of the LPP protein. However, deletion of the α-actinin binding site did not alter the targeting of the proline-rich region to focal adhesions (Fig. 5, B andB′). Deletion of the VASP binding sites in addition to the α-actinin binding site (GFP-LPP-(94–415)) had no effect on targeting to focal adhesions (Fig. 5, C and C′). Further deletion of the TRIP6 similar region in addition to the α-actinin and VASP binding sites (GFP-LPP-(94–415)Δ(205–230)) also had no effect (results not shown). These results indicate that the focal adhesion targeting capacity of the proline-rich region of LPP is located either between the VASP binding sites and the TRIP6 similar region or between the TRIP6 similar region and the C-terminal end of the proline-rich region. In order to discriminate between these two possibilities, we made constructs expressing GFP-LPP proteins containing either of these segments of the proline-rich region with the TRIP6 similar region (GFP-LPP-(94–258), GFP-LPP-(179–415)) or without the TRIP6 similar region (GFP-LPP-(94–258)Δ(205–230), GFP-LPP-(179–415)Δ(205–230)) (Fig. 4). GFP-LPP-(94–258) and GFP-LPP-(94–258)Δ(205–230) almost entirely lost the ability to target to focal adhesions (Fig. 5, D, D′,F, and F′). However, occasionally, targeting to stress fibers was observed (Fig. 5, E, E′,G, and G′). In this regard, we noticed that wild-type LPP protein is also occasionally observed along stress fibers. 3M. Petit, unpublished results. On the other hand, GFP-LPP-(179–415) and GFP-LPP-(179–415)Δ(205–230) did show targeting to focal adhesions in a way that was indistinguishable from the targeting capacity of the entire proline-rich region (Fig. 5,H, H′, I, and I′). These results indicate that the LPP proline-rich region harbors targeting capacity for focal adhesions and stress fibers and that these capacities are located between the TRIP6 similar region and the C-terminal end of the proline-rich region, and between the VASP binding sites and the TRIP6 similar region, respectively. Our results suggest that"

Drosophila sex determination offers a system in which the factors involved in cascades of RNA processing events have been identified genetically. The gene Sxl controls the processes of sex determination, dosage compensation, and sexual behavior (6Schutt C. Nothiger R. Development. 2000; 127: 667-677Google Scholar). It encodes an RNA-binding protein (SXL)1 that is present exclusively in female flies and that induces female-specific patterns of alternative splicing of target genes. Female somatic differentiation and sexual behavior, for example, depend upon activation by SXL of a female-specific 3′ splice site in the gene transformer (7Boggs R.T. Gregor P. Idriss S. Belote J.M. McKeown M. Cell. 1987; 50: 739-747Google Scholar, 8Inoue K. Hoshijima K. Sakamoto H. Shimura Y. Nature. 1990; 344: 461-463Google Scholar, 9McKeown M. Belote J.M. Baker B.S.

Cell. 1989; 58: 449-459Google Scholar, 12Valcarcel J. Singh R. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 171-175Google Scholar). Use of the non-sex-specific 3′ splice site results in mRNAs with little coding capacity because of the presence of premature stop codons. The stop codons are skipped when the female-specific 3′ splice site is used, thus generating mRNAs that encode full-length TRA protein. In addition SXL controls splicing of its own pre-mRNA in an autoregulatory loop essential for the maintenance of sexual identity throughout the life of the fly (13Bell L.R. Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 229-239Google Scholar). Genetic analyses have revealed three additional genes involved in at least some of the splicing events regulated by SXL: snf(sans-fille) (14Flickinger T.W. Salz H.K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 914-925Google Scholar), vir (virilizer) (15Hilfiker A. Amrein H. Dubendorfer A. Schneiter R. Nothiger R. Development. 1995; 121: 4017-4026Google Scholar), and fl (2)d (female-lethal (2)d) (16Granadino B. Campuzano S. Sanchez L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2597-2602Google Scholar). snf encodes the Drosophila homolog of two human splicing factors, U1A and U2B“, which are components of the U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, respectively (14Flickinger T.W. Salz H.K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 914-925Google Scholar,17Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Gunderson S.I. Kandels-Lewis S. Seraphin B. Mattaj I.W. RNA. 1996; 2: 11-23Google Scholar). vir and fl (2)d encode nuclear proteins without significant homologies to characterized proteins in data bases (18Niessen M. Schneiter R. Nothiger R. Genetics. 2001; 157: 679-688Google Scholar, 19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar). fl (2)d is required throughout development and adult life and is important for splicing regulation of Sxl andtra (transformer) pre-mRNAs (16Granadino B. Campuzano S. Sanchez L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2597-2602Google Scholar, 20Granadino B. Penalva L.O. Sanchez L. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 26-31Google Scholar), and these activities can account for the sex-specific phenotype associated with certain fl (2)d mutant alleles. The non-sex-specific lethal phenotype of other fl (2)d alleles suggests an additional function for the gene (21Granadino B. San Juan A. Santamaria P. Sanchez L. Genetics. 1992; 130: 597-612Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic interactions, however, have remained elusive. In this report we show that the FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D protein forms complexes with SXL and VIR and that depletion of a FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D human homolog from nuclear extracts affects tra splicing in vitro. These results argue that FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D has a biochemical role in splicing regulation. Interestingly, hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D was independently identified as a protein that interacts with the WT1 (Wilms' tumor1) protein (22Little N.A. Hastie N.D. Davies R.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2231-2239Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor gene WT1is important for genitourinary development, and its mutation is associated with Wilms' tumor, a common form of pediatric kidney cancer (23Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar, 24Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar). The gene encodes various isoforms of a protein containing four zinc fingers generated by alternative splicing, editing, and differential use of translation start sites. Some isoforms differ by the presence or absence of three amino acids (KTS) located between the third and fourth C-terminal zinc fingers (23Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar). Although the −KTS isoform binds nucleic acids and regulates transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation/differentiation (25Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Google Scholar, 26Sukhatme V.P. Cao X.M. Chang L.C. Tsai-Morris C.H. Stamenkovich D. Ferreira P.C. Cohen D.R. Edwards S.A. Shows T.B.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2032-2040Google Scholar), the +KTS isoform binds RNA rather than DNA and has been shown to be associated and localized with splicing factors (29Caricasole A. Duarte A.

Engelkamp D. Rassoulzadegan M. Ross A. Cuzin F. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Cell. 1995; 81: 391-401Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this isoform in RNA processing. Evidence for separable functions of the −/+ KTS isoforms was recently provided by studies in mice where each of the isoforms were knocked out separately (33Hammes A. Guo J.K. Lutsch G. Leheste J.R. Landrock D. Ziegler U. Gubler M.C. Schedl A. Cell. 2001; 106: 319-329Google Scholar). This study demonstrated that the +KTS isoform was essential for male sexual determination, which is consistent with the finding that patients that suffer from Frasier syndrome fail to produce this isoform, and males frequently show sex reversal (23Hastie N.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 391-394Google Scholar). We discuss in this manuscript the involvement of FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)d-like proteins in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression during sex determination in flies and mammals. Flies were cultured on standard food at 25 or 18 °C. For a description of chromosomes and mutants see Ref.34Lindsley D.L. Zimm G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar. Descriptions of the fl (2)d1 and fl (2)d2 alleles can be found in Refs. 19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar and 21Granadino B. San Juan A. Santamaria P. Sanchez L. Genetics. 1992; 130: 597-612Google Scholar. AdML1 pre-mRNA (MINX) was generated by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase using as template plasmid pAdML (pMINX) digested withBamHI. M-tra pre-mRNA contains the 5′ splice site of the AdML pre-mRNA and the alternative 3′ splice sites of the first intron of the Drosophila gene transformer and was generated by in vitro transcription with SP6 using as template pGEM-M-tra digested with BamHI (12Valcarcel J. Singh R. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 171-175Google Scholar). GST-SXL was expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli as described (12Valcarcel J. Singh R. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 171-175Google Scholar). The protein was dialyzed against Dignam buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 0.1 m KCl. FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D protein was expressed in insect Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus containing His-tagged FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D cDNA under the polyhedrin promoter using the pFASTBAC™ vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant protein was expressed and purified on nickel beads according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer and dialyzed against buffer D with 0.1 m KCl. Anti-FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D and anti-hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP antibodies were described previously (19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar, 22Little N.A. Hastie N.D. Davies R.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2231-2239Google Scholar). Anti-FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D and hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP antibodies were affinity-purified, eluted in 200 mm glycine and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 2.5, and neutralized immediately. Anti-SXL polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits using as antigen GST-SXL and RIBI as adjuvant (ImmunoChem Research). The antisera used in this study correspond to bleeds obtained after four boosts with the same antigen. Nuclear extracts fromDrosophila embryos were prepared according to Ref. 35Becker P.B. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2241-2249Google Scholar. HeLa nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al.(36Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar) or purchased from 4C Biotech (Seneffe, Belgium). Based in the homology between FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D and the product of a conceptual translation of the expressed sequence tag human clone D14661, a fragment of hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR. RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of 5′ and 3′ cDNAs ends was carried out using the Qiagen RNeasy kit for RNA isolation and the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen) for full-length cDNA amplification. Antibodies against FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D were bound to protein A-Sepharose by dimethylpimelimidate-mediated cross-linking at room temperature in a rotating wheel for 2 h. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of NEB buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 12.5 mmMgCl, 40 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated with 2 ml of Drosophila embryo nuclear extract for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing four times with buffer, the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer and heated to 95 °C for 3 min to release immunoprecipitated proteins. After electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the gels were fixed for 30 min in 10% glacial acetic acid, 10% methanol. Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was carried out by washing with water twice for 2 min and then for an hour on a shaking platform. The gel was sensitized with 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 1–2 min, then thiosulfate solution was discarded, and the gel quickly rinsed with two 30-s changes of water. The gel was developed with a solution of 0.04% formaldehyde in 2% sodium carbonate. When a sufficient degree of staining was obtained, development was quenched by discarding the developing solution and washing the gel with 1% acetic acid. Bands of interest were excised and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were extracted as described previously (37Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Google Scholar). For matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass mapping, a thin film technique was used for target preparation as described previously (38Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 23: 734-740Google Scholar). Western blots of protein preparations from flies were obtained by freezing the animals and homogenizing them in SDS loading buffer. Appropriate amounts of extract were fractionated by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and incubated with anti-FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D rabbit antiserum at 1:500 dilution and anti-mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) at 1:50.000 dilution for 1 h. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates IgGs (Amersham Biosciences) were used as secondary antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution for 1 h. The blots were developed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to film. 1 ml of either of two different anti-hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP polyclonal antisera (or 300 μl of affinity-purified antiserum) or the corresponding preimmune sera were coupled to 200 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 fast flow beads (Amersham Biosciences) by dimethylpimelimidate-mediated cross-linking. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature in a rotating wheel, the unbound antibodies were eliminated by serial washes with 0.2 methanolamine, pH 8, and 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, and the beads were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then equilibrated with buffer D with 0.1 or 1 m KCl. The first round of depletion was carried out using 200 μl of the beads and 300 μl of HeLa nuclear extracts at 0.1 m KCl. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel, the beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was adjusted to 1m KCl to carry out a second round of depletion at 1m KCl. The depleted extract was separated from the beads by centrifugation using Mobitec columns and dialyzed against buffer D with 0.1 m KCl. RNAs transcribed in the presence of CAP analog (m7G (5′) ppp (5′) G) (New England Biolabs) and for some experiments [α-32P]UTP (AmershamBiosciences) were gel-purified. 20 fmol of RNA were used to set up 10 μl of in vitro splicing mixes containing 2.7 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 4.8 units/μl RNasin, 3% polyvinyl alcohol, 30% nuclear extracts, or 45% immunodepleted/mock depleted nuclear extracts, complemented with either buffer D with 0.1m KCl or with recombinant proteins (SXL or FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D) in the same buffer. After incubation, the RNAs were purified by proteinase K treatment, phenol chloroform extraction, and precipitation. Spliced products were analyzed directly by electrophoresis on 13% denaturating polyacrylamide gels in Tris-borate-EDTA buffer when radioactively labeled RNA was used in the assays. tra alternative splicing was analyzed by primer extension using splice junction-specific primers as described (12Valcarcel J. Singh R. Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1993; 362: 171-175Google Scholar). The gels were exposed to PhosphorImager screens (Fuji BAS-MP), and the intensity of the bands was quantified. Affinity-purified anti-FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation assays in Drosophila embryo nuclear extracts. Equivalent amounts of immunoglobulins from preimmune sera were used as controls. First, the presence of SXL in the precipitates was analyzed by Western blot using specific antibodies. Fig. 1 A shows that SXL could be detected in the precipitates obtained using anti-FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D antibodies but not in control immunoprecipitates. This result indicates that FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D and SXL are part of a complex in embryo nuclear extracts. This conclusion is also supported by the presence of both proteins in similar fractions when nuclear extracts were fractionated on sucrose gradients (data not shown). The results were not affected by treatment of the extract with RNase A previous to immunoprecipitation, arguing against the possibility that the two proteins are co-precipitated because of their independent association to the same pre-mRNA. GST pull-down and far Western blot assays, however, failed to demonstrate a direct interaction between the two proteins (data not shown). To identify additional components associated to FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D, the products of immunoprecipitation were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver nitrate. Two polypeptides of around 120 and 220 kDa could be identified that were precipitated by anti FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D antibodies but not by preimmune sera (Fig. 1 B). The corresponding bands were excised from the gel and sequenced by mass spectrometry (37Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Google Scholar, 38Vorm O. Roepstorff P. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 23: 734-740Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analyses identified these polypeptides as the products of the genes virilizer(vir) (18Niessen M. Schneiter R. Nothiger R. Genetics. 2001; 157: 679-688Google Scholar) and dim-7 (40Lorenzen J.A. Baker S.E. Denhez F. Melnick M.B. Brower D.L. Perkins L.A. Development. 2001; 128: 1403-1414Google Scholar). Previous genetic data have implicated the gene vir in SXL function (15Hilfiker A. Amrein H. Dubendorfer A. Schneiter R. Nothiger R. Development. 1995; 121: 4017-4026Google Scholar). The presence of VIR in FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D immunoprecipitates opens the possibility that the genetic interactions observed betweenSxl, fl (2)d, and vir are based upon physical association of the products of these genes. The genedim-7 encodes a protein homologous to the human RanBP7 (Ran-binding protein7), which is a member of the importin β family of nuclear import receptors (40Lorenzen J.A. Baker S.E. Denhez F. Melnick M.B. Brower D.L. Perkins L.A. Development. 2001; 128: 1403-1414Google Scholar, 41Gorlich D. Dabrowski M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Google Scholar). As was the case with SXL, association of VIR and DIM-7 proteins with FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D was not affected by RNase A digestion previous to the precipitation assay, suggesting that the complex is not mediated by RNA. One possible explanation for the genetic interactions observed betweenSxl and fl (2)d is that FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D influences SXL synthesis or accumulation. To test this, we made use of a fl (2)d mutation, fl (2)d1, which is a recessive temperature-sensitive allele generated by substitution of aspartic acid 179 to asparagine in FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D protein (19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar). This allele is homozygous lethal for females at 29 °C but not at 18 °C, and it does not affect the viability of males at either temperature (16Granadino B. Campuzano S. Sanchez L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2597-2602Google Scholar). The levels of FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D were similar in homozygous fl (2)d1 male flies maintained at 29 or 18 °C (Fig. 2 A). This result indicates that the fl (2)d1 mutation does not cause a reduction in the levels of the protein at the restrictive temperature. The experiments were carried out after heat shock treatment for reasons that will become obvious below. Next we tested whether accumulation of SXL was affected. For this purpose we used the very strong fl (2)d1/fl (2)d2 mutant genotype, which shows also temperature sensitivity. The fl (2)d2 allele produces a nonfunctional truncated protein (19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar), and therefore the presence of functional, full-length FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D in these flies results exclusively from expression of the fl (2)d1 allele. Transgenic male flies transformed with a Sxl cDNA (SxlcF#1) under a heat shock promoter (13Bell L.R. Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 229-239Google Scholar) were subject to heat shock, and accumulation of SXL in fl (2)d1/fl (2)d2 flies was measured at permissive and restrictive temperatures by Western blot analysis. The levels of SXL 48 h after heat shock were similar at both temperatures (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 3 and4 or lanes 5 and 6). Although the amounts of SXL detected were relatively low, previous work has proven that efficient splicing regulation of transformer could be achieved under these experimental conditions (13Bell L.R. Horabin J.I. Schedl P. Cline T.W. Cell. 1991; 65: 229-239Google Scholar). We conclude that thefl (2)d1 mutation affects the functional properties of FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D rather than the stability of the protein and that FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D is not involved in the synthesis or degradation of SXL. The product of conceptual translation of human expressed sequence tags D14661 and DKFZp761K0722 show homology to a region comprising residues 112–216 of FL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D (19Penalva L.O. Ruiz M.F. Ortega A. Granadino B. Vicente L. Segarra C. Valcarcel J. Sanchez L. Genetics. 2000; 155: 129-139Google Scholar). 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to determine the sequence of full-length hfl (2)d transcripts, and alignment to RefSeq genomic sequences was used to establish the exon/intron structure of the locus. Interestingly, some of the exon/intron boundaries have been conserved between human and Drosophila, further arguing that the two genes are evolutionarily related (Fig. 3 A). hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP shows 40% overall identity (50% similarity) to dFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D and 63% identity and 76% similarity in the region between residues 136 and 298 (Fig. 3 B). This region contains aspartate 179, which is mutated in the fl (2)d1 allele mentioned in the previous section. The motif with highest homology includes residues 204–238, where the two proteins are 85% identical and 94% similar. Antibodies raised against hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP were used to deplete the protein from HeLa nuclear extracts. After one round of depletion at 0.1 m and a second round at 1 mKCl, the concentration of the protein was reduced by at least 90% (Fig. 4 A). In vitrosplicing of a model adenovirus pre-mRNA was not reduced in depleted extracts compared with mock depleted extracts (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). This result indicates that depletion of hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP does not compromise splicing of all introns in vitro. To address the possibility that hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP has a role in splicing regulation, in vitro alternative splicing assays were carried out in hFL (2Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar)D/WTAP-depleted and mock depleted HeLa nuclear extracts. Previous work has shown that the activation of a female-specific 3′ splice site in transformer pre-mRNA can be reproduced in vitro by the addition of recombinant purified SXL protein to human nuclear extracts (12Valcarcel J.

Type 1A topoisomerases relax only negatively supercoiled DNA with Mg2+ requirement, whereas type IB topoisomerases relax both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA even in the absence of a metallic cofactor, although Mg2+ and Ca2+ stimulate the relaxation activity (6Liu L.F.

The nonconserved amino-terminal domain contains putative signals for nuclear localization of the enzyme. The largest domain, the core, is essential for enzyme activity and shows high phylogenetic conservation, particularly in the residues closely interacting with DNA. The third domain is known as the linker, which is poorly conserved and highly variable in length and is not essential for the enzyme activity. Finally, the carboxyl-terminal domain is highly conserved and crucial for the catalytic activity.

A DNA topoisomerase IB-like gene (LdTOP1A), which encodes for a protein lacking the conventional active site “SKXXY,” motif has been characterized in L. donovani. However, heterologous expression ofLdTOP1A gene in Escherichia coli produced an inactive protein (12Broccoli S. Marquis J.F. Papadopoulou B. Oliver M. Drolet M.

Unlike type I DNA topoisomerases from several other organisms, the leishmanial enzyme is encoded by two different genes (LdTOP1A and LdTOP1B) located at two different chromosomes, and the polypeptide encoded by LdTOP1B gene contains the conserved SKXXY motif required for activity. This, to our knowledge, is the first report in which two different genes code for an active DNA topoisomerase I.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMedia and reagents were purchased from Sigma. Primers were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Leishmania and Yeast StrainsFor protein expression Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain EKY3 [MAT α ura3-52 his3Δ200 leu2 Δ1 trp1 Δ63 top1 D::TRP1], deficient in DNA topoisomerase I activity, was used. L. donovani strain LSB-51.1 (MHOM/S.D./00/Khartoum) was maintained as promastigotes at 26 °C in Schneider's insect medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml).Cloning of DNA Topoisomerase ITo generate a DNA probe for isolation of the L. donovani LdTOP1A gene (GenBankTM accession number AF303577), 100 pmol of two degenerated primers based on sequence homology alignments 5′-GAT/CACGATCGTCGGT/CTGCTG-3′(sense), corresponding to amino acid residues DTVGCC, and 5′-GTAG/CGTA/GCGGAACACCTT-3′(antisense), coding to the conserved sequence KVFRTY, were added to a reaction mixture containing 100 ng ofLeishmania genomic DNA, 200 μmconcentration each of dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene). A single 264-bp PCR product was obtained and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). A random labeled probe (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was prepared using this 264-bp PCR product as template to screen a L. donovani λ-EMBL3 genomic library (a gift from Dr. Meade, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS) (13Meade J.C. Shaw J. Lemaster S. Gallagher G. Stringer J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 11: 3937-3946Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 plaque-forming units were plated and screened by the PCR probe. One positive bacteriophage clone was isolated, which was further purified through tertiary screening, and sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis was performed by DNAstar, whereas comparisons with other genes of the data base were performed using the search algorithm BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J.

Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.22Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 109 cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Plasmid DNAs were isolated by the alkaline lysis procedure. Chromosomal localization of the genes was conducted by PFGE. Briefly,L. donovani LSB-51.1 (MHOM/S.D./00/Khartoum) promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and mixed with 2% agarose at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Processing of the samples was made at 50 °C for 48 h in 10 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Sarkosyl, and 150 μl of 2 mg/ml fresh-made proteinase K. Separation of the chromosomal bands was achieved at 14 °C in 1% agarose gels with 0.5 × TBE running buffer (45 mmTris borate), using a clamped homogeneous electrical field electrophoresis (CHEF, Bio-Rad) with a 35–120-s ramping pulse at 6 V/cm for 24 h. S. cerevisiae chromosomes were used as molecular weight markers. After staining with ethidium bromide, gels were blotted onto nylon membranes (Sigma) by alkaline transfer. DNA, RNA, and chromosomal blots were hybridized with the randomly primed α-32P-labeled DNA probes. All post-hybridization washes were performed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C.Nuclear Run-on AssayTranscription in isolated nuclei was achieved as described previously by Quijada et al. (16Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, logarithmic phase promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer. Cells were lysed by vortexing in the presence of Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Immediately nuclei washing buffer was added, and the nuclei were pelleted (3000 ×g), washed, and stored at −70 °C until use. In vitro transcription was performed for 10 min at 26 °C in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was stopped, and the radiolabeled nascent RNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform. Non-incorporated isotopes were removed on ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (AmershamBiosciences). 3 μg of each plasmid, to be probed with the nascent RNA, was linearized, denatured, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. The membrane was then subjected to hybridization with the purified labeled RNA.Plasmid ConstructionsPlasmids were constructed using conventional cloning techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.22Google Scholar) and propagated using the E. coli strain TOP10F′ [mcrAΔ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80ΔlacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 recA1deoR araD139 Δ(ara-leu) 7697 galU galK rpsL endA1nupG (F′: lacYq Tn10 TetR)] (Invitrogen). The sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing along both the critical junction sequence sites.YCpGAL1-LdTOP1A-URA ConstructionThe 1.9-kbLdTOP1A gene was amplified from L. donovanigenomic DNA, using a sense primer with a flanking BamHI site and a RGS(His)6 tag: 5′-GCGGATCCGACATGAGAGGATCGCACCACCACCACCACCACAAGGTGGAGAATAGCAAGATGGGGGTGAAG-3′ and an antisense primer with a flanking XbaI site: 5′-CCTCTAGAGGACTCCGACACCTACAGACGAACAGAGTCACTCG-3′, which correspond, respectively, to amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal ends of the LdTOP1A gene. Restriction sites are underlined, and the start codon for DNA topoisomerase I is indicated in bold. The amplified fragment was cloned into the BamHI-SpeI site of the YCpGAL1-URA vector (a gift from Dr. J. C. Wang, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA). The resultant construct, YCpGAL1-LdTOP1A-URA contained the LdTOP1A gene driven by the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter.YCpGAL1-LdTOP1B-URA ConstructionA 838-bpBamHI-ClaI fragment from pSK-LdTOP1Bwas subloned into the YCpGAL1-URA vector. This construct contained theLdTOP1B gene also driven by GAL1 promoter.pESC LdTOP1A-LdTOP1B-URA ConstructionIn a two-fragment ligation reaction, the construct was created by insertion ofLdTOP1A previously cut with BamHI-XhoI from YCpGAL1-LdTOP1A-URA and LdTOP1B cut withNotI-SpeI from YCpGAL1-LdTOP1B-URA.The resultant construct encodes the full-length L. donovaniDNA topoisomerase I driven by the GAL1 and GAL10 promoters.YCpGAL1-hTOP-URA described previously (17Woo M.H.

YCpGAL1-LdTOP1A-URA,YCpGAL1-LdTOP1B-URA, or pESC LdTOP1A-LdTOP1B-URA, carrying the URA3 selectable marker, by treatment with lithium acetate (18Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T.

Transformants were selected on synthetic complete–uracil medium. At least four independent clones were selected from each transformation. After 6-h induction with 2% galactose in synthetic complete ura-raffinose medium, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended at the ratio of 2 g of wet cells/2 ml of TEEG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) supplemented with or without 0.2 m KCl and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 × sodium fluoride, 1 × sodium bisulfite, 2 × Complete Mini® (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cell extracts were prepared by disruption with acid-washed glass beads according to a procedure previously described (21Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Bjornsti M.A. Methods Mol.

Briefly, cells were subjected to one freeze/thaw cycle at −80 °C, lysed by vortexing with 425–600 μm glass beads, and the extracts cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.In Vitro Relaxation AssayDNA topoisomerase I activity was assayed by the relaxation of negatively supercoiled plasmid DNA. DNA topoisomerase I proteins were incubated in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 0.3 μg of pHC624 DNA (2015 bp, plasmid substrate), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mg/ml gelatin, 150 mm KCl.

Reactions were terminated by the addition of 1% SDS, and the extent of plasmid DNA relaxation was assessed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel in 0.1m Tris borate buffer, pH 8.0, at 5 V/cm for 4 h. The gels were visualized under UV illumination after staining with ethidium bromide and photographed (24Ivens A.C. Lewis S.M. Bagherzadeh A. Zhang L. Chan H.M. Smith D.F. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis paper describes the molecular cloning and characterization of a new gene (LdTOP1B) encoding the carboxyl-terminal domain of DNA topoisomerase I in L. donovani. The results suggest that two different proteins, codified by two different genes located on different chromosomes, were required to reconstitute a catalytically active DNA topoisomerase I in Leishmania. Similar intensities of the hybridization signals obtained withLdTOP1A and LdTOP1B genes in the nuclear run-on assays indicate that the abundance of nascent RNA transcripts derived from both genes was similar, and an interaction, probably at post-translational level, should occur to reconstitute an active DNA topoisomerase I.A type I DNA topoisomerase of 67 kDa has been purified fromL. donovani promastigotes nuclear extracts by Chakraborty et al. (10Chakraborty A.D. Gupta A. Majumder H.K. Ind. J. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 30: 257-263PubMed Google Scholar). Das et al. (25Das A. Mandal C. Dasgupta A. Sengupta T. Majumder H.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 794-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) have recently described that this enzyme harbors a serine in place of the usual catalytic tyrosine. In addition a theoretical protein model for L. donovani topoisomerase was presented, suggesting that the serine 553 acts as the reactive nucleophile for enzyme catalysis. However, it is difficult to understand how a serine residue can stand-in for phosphodiesterase activity, since some experiments in which active yeast DNA topoisomerase I was mutated at their active site (Tyr727) to Ser or Phe resulted in enzyme inactivation (23Lynn R.M. Bjornsti M.-A Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3559-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a DNA topoisomerase I-like gene, lacking the sequence corresponding to a conventional active site motif, has been described in L. donovani. Heterologous expression of the LdTOP1A gene in E. coli resulted in production of a catalytically inactive protein (12Broccoli S. Marquis J.F. Papadopoulou B. Oliver M. Drolet M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).In previous studies with human DNA topoisomerase I, Stewartet al. (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were able to reconstitute the enzyme activity by mixing a 58-kDa recombinant core domain with a series of different recombinant carboxyl-terminal fragments, which bind tightly to the core domain forming 1:1 complex probably through non-covalent interactions. This model hypothesizes that the core and carboxyl-terminal domains of topoisomerase I are folded independently and then are simply associated with each other to form an active enzyme (26Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism may be suggested for independent refolding of LdTOP1A andLdTOP1B gene products, resulting in reconstitution of an active topoisomerase I in L. donovani. The results therefore suggest the presence of a novel type of dimeric topoisomerase I inL. donovani. Understanding of distinct molecular characteristics of the leishmanial topoisomerase I and regulation of expression of the enzyme during parasite growth may be useful for development of selective inhibitors of leishmanial topoisomerase I as promising leishmanicidal agents. DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze changes in DNA topology by altering the linkage of DNA strands, solving topological problems caused by cellular processes such as DNA replication, transcription, or recombination (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Type 1A topoisomerases relax only negatively supercoiled DNA with Mg2+ requirement, whereas type IB topoisomerases relax both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA even in the absence of a metallic cofactor, although Mg2+ and Ca2+ stimulate the relaxation activity (6Liu L.F.

L. donovani strain LSB-51.1 (MHOM/S.D./00/Khartoum) was maintained as promastigotes at 26 °C in Schneider's insect medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml).Cloning of DNA Topoisomerase ITo generate a DNA probe for isolation of the L. donovani LdTOP1A gene (GenBankTM accession number AF303577), 100 pmol of two degenerated primers based on sequence homology alignments 5′-GAT/CACGATCGTCGGT/CTGCTG-3′(sense), corresponding to amino acid residues DTVGCC, and 5′-GTAG/CGTA/GCGGAACACCTT-3′(antisense), coding to the conserved sequence KVFRTY, were added to a reaction mixture containing 100 ng ofLeishmania genomic DNA, 200 μmconcentration each of dNTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Stratagene). A single 264-bp PCR product was obtained and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega). A random labeled probe (Random Primed DNA labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was prepared using this 264-bp PCR product as template to screen a L. donovani λ-EMBL3 genomic library (a gift from Dr. Meade, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS) (13Meade J.C. Shaw J. Lemaster S. Gallagher G. Stringer J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 11: 3937-3946Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). 5 × 104 plaque-forming units were plated and screened by the PCR probe. One positive bacteriophage clone was isolated, which was further purified through tertiary screening, and sequenced on both strands. Sequence analysis was performed by DNAstar, whereas comparisons with other genes of the data base were performed using the search algorithm BLAST (14Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59110) Google Scholar).Nucleic Acid Isolation, Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE),1 and Hybridization AnalysisGenomic DNA was isolated from 2 × 109 L. donovani promastigotes by standard procedures (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.22Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from 109 cells using an RNA isolation kit (Qiagen). Plasmid DNAs were isolated by the alkaline lysis procedure. Chromosomal localization of the genes was conducted by PFGE. Briefly,L. donovani LSB-51.1 (MHOM/S.D./00/Khartoum) promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and mixed with 2% agarose at the ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Processing of the samples was made at 50 °C for 48 h in 10 ml of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 1% Sarkosyl, and 150 μl of 2 mg/ml fresh-made proteinase K. Separation of the chromosomal bands was achieved at 14 °C in 1% agarose gels with 0.5 × TBE running buffer (45 mmTris borate), using a clamped homogeneous electrical field electrophoresis (CHEF, Bio-Rad) with a 35–120-s ramping pulse at 6 V/cm for 24 h. S. cerevisiae chromosomes were used as molecular weight markers. After staining with ethidium bromide, gels were blotted onto nylon membranes (Sigma) by alkaline transfer. DNA, RNA, and chromosomal blots were hybridized with the randomly primed α-32P-labeled DNA probes. All post-hybridization washes were performed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C.Nuclear Run-on AssayTranscription in isolated nuclei was achieved as described previously by Quijada et al. (16Quijada L. Soto M. Alonso C. Requena J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4493-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, logarithmic phase promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation and suspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer. Cells were lysed by vortexing in the presence of Nonidet P-40 and Triton X-100. Immediately nuclei washing buffer was added, and the nuclei were pelleted (3000 ×g), washed, and stored at −70 °C until use. In vitro transcription was performed for 10 min at 26 °C in the presence of 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction was stopped, and the radiolabeled nascent RNA was extracted by phenol:chloroform. Non-incorporated isotopes were removed on ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (AmershamBiosciences). 3 μg of each plasmid, to be probed with the nascent RNA, was linearized, denatured, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. The membrane was then subjected to hybridization with the purified labeled RNA.Plasmid ConstructionsPlasmids were constructed using conventional cloning techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.22Google Scholar) and propagated using the E. coli strain TOP10F′ [mcrAΔ(mrr-hsdRMS-mcrBC) φ80ΔlacZΔM15 ΔlacX74 recA1deoR araD139 Δ(ara-leu) 7697 galU galK rpsL endA1nupG (F′: lacYq Tn10 TetR)] (Invitrogen). The sequences were verified by dideoxy sequencing along both the critical junction sequence sites.YCpGAL1-LdTOP1A-URA ConstructionThe 1.9-kbLdTOP"

In subconfluent MDCK cells, 4.1N is distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus; IP3R1 is localized in the cytoplasm. In confluent MDCK cells, both 4.1N and IP3R1 are predominantly translocated to the basolateral membrane domain, whereas 4.1R, the prototypical homologue of 4.1N, is localized at the tight junctions (Mattagajasingh, S. N., Huang, S. C., Hartenstein, J. S., and Benz, E. J., Jr. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 30573–30585), and other endoplasmic reticulum marker proteins are still present in the cytoplasm. Moreover, the 4.1N-binding region of IP3R1 is necessary and sufficient for the localization of IP3R1 at the basolateral membrane domain. A fragment of the IP3R1-binding region of 4.1N blocks the localization of co-expressed IP3R1 at the basolateral membrane domain. These data indicate that 4.1N is required for IP3R1 translocation to the basolateral membrane domain in polarized MDCK cells.

Three distinct types of IP3R (types 1–3) have been cloned (3Furuichi T. Kohda K. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Three functional domains of the most characterized type 1 IP3R (IP3R1), a 2749-amino acid polypeptide, have been studied intensively. The N-terminal portion (residues 1–578) is a ligand-binding domain (4Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 5Miyawaki A. Furuichi T. Ryou Y.

The middle portion (residues 579–2275) is the modulatory domain for various intracellular modulators (Ca2+, calmodulin, and ATP) and for phosphorylation by several protein kinases (cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and tyrosine kinase) (6Mignery G.A.

Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Near the C terminus is a clustered six membrane-spanning channel domain (residues 2276–2589) (12Yoshikawa S. Tanimura T. Miyawaki A. Nakamura M. Yuzaki M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16613-16619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the function of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (residues 2590–2749) has not been fully clarified. To study the function of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1, we searched for molecules binding the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail using a yeast two-hybrid system. Protein 4.1N, a homologue of the erythrocyte membrane cytoskeleton protein 4.1, was identified as a binding molecule for the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1. Protein 4.1, originally identified in red blood cells and called red blood cell protein 4.1 (4.1R), plays a critical role in the morphology and mechanical stability of the red blood cell plasma membrane (13Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Three structural/functional domains have been identified in 4.1R. The N-terminal membrane-binding domain (also called the 30-kDa or FERM domain) (14Chishti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N.

An internal domain contains the spectrin-actin binding (also called the 10-kDa domain) activity required for membrane stability (20Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

Three homologues of 4.1R have been cloned: the widely expressed homologue 4.1G, the neuronal homologue 4.1N, and the brain homologue 4.1B. They share a high degree of homology with prototypical homologue 4.1R in the three structural/functional domains. Each 4.1 protein is characterized by three unconserved unique domains between the conserved membrane-binding domain, the spectrin-actin binding domain, and the CTD (26Parra M. Gascard P.

In this study, we found that 4.1N and IP3R1 associated in both subconfluent and confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a well studied tight polarized epithelial cell line. Both were predominantly translocated to the basolateral membrane domain when MDCK cells grew from subconfluence to confluence, whereas 4.1R, the prototypical homologue of 4.1N, was localized at the tight junction (23Mattagajasingh S.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30573-30585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and other endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker proteins were still present in the cytoplasm in confluent MDCK cells. The localization of IP3R1 at the basolateral membrane domain was determined by its 4.1N-binding region and could be blocked by a fragment of the IP3R1-binding region of 4.1N. These data suggest that 4.1N serves to regulate IP3R1 subcellular localization. All of the plasmids were propagated in the Escherichia coli strain HB101. All PCR products of the cDNA fragments were generated in frame using Platinum®Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and were verified by nucleotide sequencing using an ABI PRISM 377 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). cDNA encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (IP3R1/CTT, aa 2590–2749) were generated by PCR from mouse IP3R1 cDNA and subcloned into the site of EcoRI and BamHI of pGBT9 (Clontech) to generate pGBT9-IP3R1/CTT, into the site of EcoRI and BamHI of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) to generate GFP-IP3R1/CTT, and into the site of BamHI and EcoRI of pGEX-KG (27Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar) to generate GST-IP3R1/CTT. Truncated constructs corresponding to different lengths of IP3R1/CTT (see Fig. 3 A) were subcloned into the site of EcoRI andBamHI of pGBT9. GFP-IP3R1-N was generated by subcloning full-length mouse IP3R1 fusing with an EGFP cDNA in its N terminus into pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen). 2T. Nakayama, M. Hattori, K. Uchida, T. Nakamura, Y. Tateishi, H. Bannai, M. Iwai, T. Michikawa, T. Inoue, and K. Mikoshiba, unpublished data. GFP-IP3R1/Δ18A10 was generated by replacing the fragment consisting of EcoRI to XhoI site (aa 2216–2749) in GFP-IP3R1-N with a PCR product consisting of aa 2216–2737 in mouse IP3R1. GFP-18A10 was generated by subcloning a synthesized cDNA fragment consisting of aa 2738–2749 in mouse IP3R1 into the site of EcoRI andBamHI in pEGFP-C3 (the terminological base for GFP-IP3R1/Δ18A10 and GFP-18A10 is that the last 14 residues of IP3R1 contain the specific recognition site by 18A10 antibody) (28Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). pBact-STneoB-C1 (used to express IP3R1) and EGFP-SERCA2a were as described previously (29Miyawaki A.

To construct the ER marker, DsRed2-KDEL, we fused the N-terminal 17 amino acids of calreticulin to the N terminus of DsRed2 (Clontech) and the ER target and retention signal, KDEL, to its C terminus by a two-step PCR as was described previously (31Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Hunnicutt G.R. Hammer III, J.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Roderick H.L. Campbell A.K. Llewellyn D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen). The mouse 4.1N cDNA was obtained by PCR using the primers of 5′-ATCGGAATTCATGACAACAGAGACAGGT-3′ and 5′-ATCGTCTAGATCAGGATTCCTGTGGCTT-3′ (the underlined letters indicate the EcoRI and XbaI sites for cloning, respectively) corresponding to full-length of mouse 4.1N sequence (accession number AF061283) using mouse cerebellum cDNA library as template and subcloned into the site of EcoRI andXbaI in pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen) (pcDNA3–4.1N). The pcDNA3-HA4.1N/FL was generated by replacing the cDNA fragment of EcoRI to EcoRV consisting of aa 1–298 of 4.1N in pcDNA3–4.1N with a PCR product that contains a corresponding sequence and is amplified using a 5′-primer containing the HA tag sequence and EcoRI site and a 3′-primer containing an EcoRV site. The pcDNA3-Venus-4.1N/FL was generated by inserting a PCR product amplified using the Venus cDNA (33Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2168) Google Scholar) as template into the site of BamHI and EcoRI in pCDNA3–4.1N. The pcDNA3-HA4.1N/ΔCTD and the pcDNA3-Venus-4.1N/ΔCTD (aa 1–766) were generated by replacing a 4.1N fragment consisting of aa 663–879 in pcDNA3-HA4.1N/FL and in pcDNA3-Venus-4.1N/FL (ApaI-ApaI), respectively, with a PCR product consisting of aa 663–766 in 4.1N. The pcDNA3-HA4.1N/CTD (aa 767–879) was generated by subcloning a PCR product of 4.1N/CTD amplified using a 5′-primer containing theEcoRI site and the HA tag sequence and a 3′-primer containing XbaI site and stop codon into the site ofEcoRI and XbaI in pcDNA3.1/Zeo+. pcDNA3-Venus-4.1N/CTD (aa 767–879) was generated by subcloning two PCR products of Venus (BamHI-EcoRI fragment) and 4.1N/CTD (EcoRI-XbaI fragment) into the sites ofBamHI and XbaI in pcDNA3.1/Zeo+. GST-4.1N/CTD was generated by subcloning a PCR product of 4.1N/CTD into the site ofBamHI and EcoRI in pGEX-KG (27Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Truncated constructs corresponding to different lengths of 4.1N (see Fig. 4 A) were subcloned into the sites of EcoRI andBamHI in pGAD424 (Clontech). The GAL4-based MATCHMAKER two-hybrid system II (Clontech) was used for the yeast two-hybrid assays. Plasmid vectors, pGBT9, and pGAD424, encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the GAL4 activating domain, respectively, were used to express hybrid proteins. To screen for proteins that interact with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (IP3R1/CTT), a mixture of embryonic and adult human brain cDNA libraries (both from Clontech) in GAL4 activating domain vector pACT2 was screened using the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of mouse IP3R type 1 cloned into GAL4 DNA-binding domain vector pGBT9 (see “Plasmid Construction” for details) as bait in PJ69–4A yeast. Positive clones were tested further for specificity by co-transformation into yeast either with pGBT9-IP3R1/CTT or with pGBT9 alone. DNA from positive clones were isolated, and the GAL4 activating domain plasmids were recovered in E. coli strain HB101 and sequenced. For binding region mapping, yeast was co-transformed with plasmids carrying respective inserts fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain or GAL4 activating domain and were assayed for nutritional selection of drop-out leucine, tryptophan, adenine, and histidine and for β-galactosidase activity on nitrocellulose filters as described in the Clontech manual. For production of anti-4.1N antibodies, a nucleotide sequence corresponding to amino acid residues 588–790 of mouse 4.1N, which has no homology to the other members of the 4.1 family, was subcloned into pRSET-C (Invitrogen). E. colistrain BL21 (DE3) was transformed with this plasmid, and His6-tagged protein was expressed and then purified over nickel columns. Japanese white rabbits and Wistar rats were immunized with the fusion protein. The rabbit antiserum was affinity-purified against GST-4.1N fragment (aa 588–790) covalently coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard protocols. The anti-IP3R1 rat monoclonal antibodies 18A10, 4C11, and 10A6 and the anti-IP3R1 mouse monoclonal antibody KM1112 were described previously (34Maeda N. Niinobe M. Nakahira K. Mikoshiba K. J.

Anti-GFP monoclonal antibody and anti-HA polyclonal antibody were purchased from Medical & Biological Laboratory, Ltd., and anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 monoclonal antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology. COS-7 and MDCK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nacalai Tesque) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. For subconfluent and confluent MDCK cells, MDCK cells were plated at 0.6–1.0 × 105 and 2.25 × 105cells, respectively, on 18 × 18 mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a 35-mm culture dish and cultured for 1 and 5 days, respectively. The transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested 1 day after transfection. Transfected MDCK cells on coverslips were fixed 3 days after transfection and then were processed for immunofluorescence staining with antibodies as described below. Lysates of subconfluent and confluent MDCK cells and of transformed E. coli, transfected COS-7 cells and whole brain of 8-week-old male ICR mice (Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka Ken, Japan)) were prepared as previously described (37Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7932-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in regard to the preparation the lysate of HEK293 cells and about preparation of P2 fraction from brain tissue, respectively. Co-immunoprecipitation from lysate of MDCK cells and lysate of whole mouse brain was performed as previously described (37Shen L. Liang F. Walensky L.D. Huganir R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7932-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pull-down binding assay was performed as a modification from the co-immunoprecipitation protocol. Briefly, lysates of E. coliand transfected COS-7 cells were first solubilized in 1% sodium deoxycholate at 36 °C for 30 min, followed by adding 0.1 volume of 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 9.0, and the preparations were centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g. The supernatants were then used for in vitrobinding assay. For each reaction, 1,000 μg of protein of solubilized lysate of E. coli was incubated with 30 μl of 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed with washing buffer (4 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) three times, and then the spun down complex of glutathione-Sepharose 4B with fusion protein was used. At the same time, 500 μg of protein of solubilized lysate of transfected COS-7 cells was incubated with 25 μl of 1:1 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C for 1 h to clear any nonspecific binding to beads from the lysates. The cleared supernatant of the lysate was then added to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B-protein complex, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. The complex was then spun down and washed with washing buffer three times. The proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 3 min and were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were probed with anti-GFP Ab, anti-4.1N Ab, 18A10 Ab, 4C11 Ab, or anti-HA Ab. The cells on coverslips were fixed in freshly prepared 1.75% paraformaldehyde in cell culture medium for 15 min at room temperature. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with PBS. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-4.1N Ab, H1L3 Ab (for endogenous IP3R1 in MDCK cells), KM1112 Ab (for exogenously expressed IP3R1), and anti-Na,K-ATPase α1 Ab; final concentration, 2 μg/ml; anti-ZO-1 antiserum, 1:1; rat anti-4.1N antiserum (only used together with H1L3 Ab for dual immunostaining of endogenous 4.1N and IP3R1 in MDCK cells); 1:50) for 1 h at room temperature and washed three times as described above. They were then incubated with suitable Alexa Fluor 488, Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies, or Alexa 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 1 h and washed three times again as described above. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescence images were taken using a confocal scanning microscope (FV-300, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an inverted microscope (I × 70; Olympus) with a 60× objective. To understand the function of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to search for binding molecules of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1. Using a fusion protein of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (IP3R1/CTT; Fig. 1 A) as bait, approximately ∼4.0 × 106 yeast transformants were screened with a mixture of embryonic and adult human brain cDNA libraries fused to the GAL4 activation domain. By nutritional selection assay, 19 positive clones were obtained, and their cDNA inserts were sequenced. Among them, seven clones encoded sequences corresponding to various lengths of the C-terminal portion of 4.1N. The sequence of the shortest fragment corresponded to the C-terminal domain (amino acid residues 767–879) of mouse 4.1N (Fig. 1 B; hereafter, this fragment is referred to as 4.1N/CTD). The interaction between 4.1N and IP3R1 was confirmed by a colony lift filter assay for β-galactosidase activity. To further verify the interaction between 4.1N and IP3R1, a pull-down assay was performed using a fusion protein of GST and 4.1N/CTD (GST-4.1N/CTD). GST-4.1N/CTD attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with the lysates of COS-7 cells transiently expressing the GFP-tagged C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (GFP-IP3R1/CTT) or GFP alone. After extensive washing, proteins bound to GST-4.1N/CTD were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-GFP antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 A, GST-4.1N/CTD bound to GFP-IP3R1/CTT but not to GFP. GST alone did not bind to GFP-IP3R1/CTT. These results indicate that 4.1N/CTD also binds to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 in vitro. To determine whether 4.1N binds to IP3R1 in vivo, lysates of whole mouse brain were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with three distinct rat anti-IP3R1 monoclonal antibodies or a rabbit anti-4.1N polyclonal antibody. Co-precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-4.1N and anti-IP3R1 antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, two bands that migrate at 135 and 100 kDa were detected with anti-4.1N antibody in the input sample and the pellets immunoprecipitated with anti-IP3R1 antibodies. These signals disappeared when the primary antibody was preincubated with the antigen protein (data not shown). The 135-kDa protein is the prototypical product of gene 4.1N. The 100-kDa protein is an isoform abundant in peripheral tissue, as reported by Walensky et al. (38Walensky L.D. Blackshaw S. Liao D. Watkins C.C. Weier H.U. Parra M. Huganir R.L. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6457-6467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, when the reciprocal immunoprecipitation was performed using a rabbit anti-4.1N antibody, IP3R1 was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 2 C). In the negative control experiments, neither normal rat IgG nor normal rabbit IgG immunoprecipitated 4.1N and IP3R1. Taken together, these observations indicate that 4.1N interacts with IP3R1 in vivo. To determine the minimal sequence responsible for IP3R1 binding to 4.1N, serial deletions of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 (Δ1-Δ5) in pGBT9 were constructed, and their associations with 4.1N/CTD were examined using a yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 3 A, whereas the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1 interacted with 4.1N/CTD, none of the deletion mutants interacted with 4.1N/CTD. These results indicate that the last 14 amino acids of IP3R1 are necessary for binding to 4.1N. A pull-down assay was then performed to confirm the yeast two-hybrid results. GST-4.1N/CTD fusion protein was incubated with the lysates of COS-7 cells transiently expressing GFP-IP3R1-N (GFP-tagged full-length IP3R1), GFP-IP3R1/Δ18A10 (GFP-tagged IP3R1 lacking the last 14 amino acids), or GFP-18A10 (the GFP-tagged last 14 amino acids of IP3R1). Expression of GFP-IP3R1-N, GFP-IP3R1/Δ18A10, and GFP-18A10 was confirmed by Western blotting assay using both anti-GFP antibody and 18A10 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 B, both GFP-IP3R1-N and GFP-18A10 were pulled down by GST-4.1N/CTD, but GFP-IP3R1/Δ18A10 was not. Neither GFP-IP3R1-N nor GFP-18A10 was pulled down by GST. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that the last 14 amino acids of IP3R1 are necessary and sufficient for binding to 4.1N. Additionally, because the last 14 amino acids of IP3R1, which contain the specific recognition site by 18A10 antibody of IP3R1 (28Nakade S. Maeda N. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), share no homology with IP3R2 and IP3R3, these data support the result of a yeast two-hybrid assay that 4.1N/CTD does not bind to the C-terminal cytoplasmic tails of either IP3R2 or IP3R3 (data not shown) and suggest that 4.1N specifically binds to IP3R1. The results of the yeast two-hybrid screening showed the shortest fragment of 4.1N required for binding to IP3R1 to correspond to amino acid sequence 767–879 of mouse 4.1N (Fig. 1 B). To test whether other parts of 4.1N also bind to IP3R1 and to more precisely determine the IP3R1-binding site of 4.1N, serial deletions of 4.1N in pGAD424 were constructed, and their associations with IP3R1/CTT were examined using a yeast two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the N-terminal fragment of 4.1N corresponding to amino acids 1–766 (4.1N/ΔCTD) did not interact with the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of IP3R1. The C-terminal domain of 4.1N (amino acids 767–879) interacted with IP3R1/CTT. However, the C-terminal domain fragment consisting of amino acids 784–879 did not. A pull-down assay was then performed to confirm the yeast two-hybrid results. The GST-IP3R1/CTT fusion protein was incubated with lysates of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding HA-tagged 4.1N fusion proteins: pcDNA3-HA4.1N/FL (HA-tagged full-length 4.1N), pcDNA3- HA4.1N/ΔCTD (HA-tagged 4.1N lacking the CTD domain, aa 1–766), or pcDNA3-HA4.1N/CTD (HA-tagged 4.1N/CTD, aa 767–879). The pull-down proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both HA4.1N/FL and HA4.1N/CTD were pulled down by GST-IP3R1/CTT, but HA4.1N/ΔCTD was not. Neither HA4.1N/FL nor HA4.1N/CTD was pulled down by GST alone. These results indicate that the CTD domain of 4.1N (aa 767–879) is necessary and sufficient for binding to IP3R1. Bush et al. (39Bush K.T. Stuart R.O., Li, S.H. Moura L.A. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23694-23699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported IP3R to be localized at the basolateral membrane domain as well as in the cytoplasm in confluent MDCK cells, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this localization have not been clarified. Considering that 4.1R, the prototypical homologue of 4.1N, is an erythroid membrane skeletal protein, we investigated the subcellular localization of 4.1N and its relationship with the localization of IP3R1 in MDCK cells. Subconfluent and confluent MDCK cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained with anti-IP3R1 and anti-4.1N antibodies or phalloidin. In subconfluent MDCK cells, IP3R1 existed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 A). 4.1N was distributed in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and partially co-localized with IP3R1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 B). Neither IP3R1 nor 4.1"

The expression of the IGF-IR gene is negatively regulated by a number of transcription factors, including the WT1 and p53 tumor suppressors. Previous studies have suggested both physical and functional interactions between the WT1 and p53 proteins. The potential functional interactions between WT1 and p53 in control of IGF-IR promoter activity were addressed by transient coexpression of vectors encoding different isoforms of WT1, together with IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, in p53-null osteosarcoma-derived Saos-2 cells, wild-type p53-expressing kidney tumor-derived G401 cells, and mutant p53-expressing, rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells. Similar studies were also performed to compare p53-expressing Balb/c-3T3 and clonally derived p53-null, (10)1 fibroblasts and the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 +/+, which expresses a wild-type p53 gene, and its HCT116 −/− derivative, in which the p53 gene has been disrupted by homologous recombination. WT1 splice variants lacking a KTS insert between zinc fingers 3 and 4 suppressed IGF-IR promoter activity in the absence of p53 or in the presence of wild-type p53. WT1 variants that contain the KTS insert are impaired in their ability to bind to the IGF-IR promoter and are unable to suppress IGF-IR promoter. In the presence of mutant p53, WT1 cannot repress the IGF-IR promoter. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that p53 and WT1 physically interact, whereas electrophoretic mobility shift assay studies revealed that p53 modulates the ability of WT1 to bind to the IGF-IR promoter. In summary, the transcriptional activity of WT1 proteins and their ability to function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes depends on the cellular status of p53.

Life Sci. 2000; 57: 932-942Google Scholar). The IGF-IR plays a central role in cell cycle regulation, as demonstrated by the fact that overexpression of this receptor in fibroblasts abrogates all requirements for exogenous growth factors (4Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R. Carpenter G. Soderquist A.M. Limardo M. Phillips P.D. Ullrich A. Baserga R. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 199-205Google Scholar). In addition to its important role during development, there is evidence pointing to a pivotal role for the IGF-IR in tumorigenesis (5Werner H. LeRoith D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 183-223Google Scholar, 6Werner H. LeRoith D. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1997; 8: 71-92Google Scholar). The IGF-IR is highly expressed by most tumors and cancer cell lines, whereas fibroblasts derived from mouse embryos in which the IGF-IR was disrupted by homologous recombination are resistant to transformation by a number of oncogenes, indicating that IGF-IR function is an important prerequisite for cellular transformation (7Sell C. Rubini M. Rubin R. Liu J.-P. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11217-11221Google Scholar,8Baserga R. Cell. 1994; 79: 927-930Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IGF-IR exhibits potent antiapoptotic effects that are consistent with the role of IGFs as cell survival factors (9Resnicoff M. Abraham D. Yutanawiboonchai W. Rotman H.L. Kajstura J. Rubin R. Zoltick P. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2463-2469Google Scholar,10Sell C. Baserga R. Rubin R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 303-306Google Scholar).Structural analysis of the IGF-IR promoter revealed that it contains multiple binding sites for the WT1 Wilms' tumor suppressor protein, a transcription factor whose inactivation has been implicated in the etiology of a subset of Wilms' tumors, a pediatric kidney malignancy (11Werner H., Re, G.G. Drummond I.A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Sens D.A. Garvin A.J. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5828-5832Google Scholar, 12Werner H. Rauscher III, F. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts C.T., Jr. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar). The WT1 gene product is a nuclear protein of 52–54 kDa that contains N-terminal transcriptional regulatory and self-association domains and a C-terminal DNA and RNA binding domain that comprises four zinc fingers of the C2-H2 class (13Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Haber D.A. Rose E.A. Kral A. Yeger H. Lewis W.H. Jones C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 60: 509-520Google Scholar, 14Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This domain binds to target DNAs containing versions of a 5′-GCGGGGGCG-3′ consensus sequence. Alternative splicing of exon 5 and the use of an alternative splice site at the end of exon 9 produces mRNAs encoding multiple WT1 isoforms (15Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Google Scholar). Using transient transfection assays, we have previously shown that WT1 proteins lacking the exon 9-encoded Lys-Thr-Ser (KTS) insert between zinc fingers 3 and 4 were more effective than the alternatively spliced +KTS variants in suppressing the activity of co-transfected IGF-IR promoter constructs (11Werner H., Re, G.G. Drummond I.A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Sens D.A. Garvin A.J. LeRoith D. Roberts C.T., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5828-5832Google Scholar, 16Tajinda K. Carroll J. Roberts C.T., Jr. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4713-4724Google Scholar). Furthermore, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and DNase I footprint analyses, we demonstrated that this transcriptional effect was associated with specific binding of the WT1-KTS isoform to sites located both upstream and downstream of the IGF-IR gene transcription initiation site (12Werner H. Rauscher III, F. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts C.T., Jr. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar). In addition, stable expression of the WT1-KTS isoform in kidney tumor-derived G401 cells resulted in a decreased rate of cellular proliferation, decreased levels of IGF-IR mRNA and protein, and reduced activity of transfected IGF-IR promoter constructs (17Werner H. Shen-Orr Z. Rauscher III, F. Morris J.F. Roberts C.T., Jr. LeRoith D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3516-3522Google Scholar).IGF-IR gene expression is also regulated by the p53 tumor suppressor (18Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher III, F.J. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8318-8323Google Scholar, 19Prisco M. Hongo A. Rizzo M.G. Sacchi A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1084-1092Google Scholar). Specifically, transcription of the IGF-IR gene is negatively regulated by wild-type p53, whereas a number of tumor-derived, mutant versions of p53 were shown to significantly stimulate the activity of the IGF-IR promoter. Unlike WT1, p53 does not exhibit specific bindingin vitro to the regulatory region of the IGF-IR gene. However, the results of EMSA and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the mechanism of action of p53 involves potential interactions with TBP, the TATA-box binding subunit of the general initiation factor TFIID, and with the Sp1 transcription factor, an important trans-activator of the IGF-IR promoter (20Beitner-Johnson D. Werner H. Roberts C.T., Jr. LeRoith D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1147-1156Google Scholar,21Ohlsson C. Kley N. Werner H. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1101-1107Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence suggest that p53 and WT1 act in concert to control cellular proliferation. Using in vitroimmunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses, p53 and WT1 proteins were shown to physically interact (22Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J. Rauscher III, F. Hill D. Haber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Google Scholar). Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated aberrant expression of p53, an event usually associated with mutation of the p53 gene, in a significant proportion of Wilms' tumors (23Lemoine N.R. Hughes C.M. Cowell J.K. J. Pathol. 1992; 168: 237-242Google Scholar). p53 mutations were usually restricted to anaplastic regions of the tumors, suggesting that progression to anaplasia is associated with clonal expansion of cells that have acquired a p53 mutation (24Bardeesy N. Beckwith J.B. Pelletier J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 215-219Google Scholar). WT1 protein was shown to stabilize p53, modulate its trans-activational properties, and inhibit its ability to induce apoptosis (25Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Google Scholar). Finally, we have previously reported that WT1 and mutant p53 are co-expressed in aggressive, estrogen receptor-negative human breast tumors (26Silberstein G.B. Van Horn K. Strickland P. Roberts C.T., Jr. Daniel C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8132-8137Google Scholar).In view of the central role of the IGF-IR in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis, and to extend our previous observations on regulation of IGF-IR gene expression by WT1 and p53, we have addressed the potential functional and physical interactions between these important tumor suppressors in the transcriptional control of the IGF-IR gene.RESULTSThe proximal ∼500 bp of 5′-flanking and ∼700 bp of the 5′-untranslated region of the IGF-IR promoter have been previously shown to contain 12 bona fide binding sites for WT1 (12Werner H. Rauscher III, F. Sukhatme V.P. Drummond I.A. Roberts C.T., Jr. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12577-12582Google Scholar). These elements bind the WT1 protein lacking the KTS insert between zinc fingers 3 and 4 with medium to high affinity, whereas the binding capacity of the WT1 isoform including the KTS insert is significantly reduced. Consistent with the results of these binding experiments, we showed that transient expression of WT1-KTS isoforms in Chinese hamster ovary cells repressed the activity of a cotransfected IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter by 80%, whereas WT1+KTS variants produced ∼40% repression (16Tajinda K. Carroll J. Roberts C.T., Jr. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4713-4724Google Scholar). To examine the transcriptional effect of WT1 in different p53 backgrounds, we extended our analysis to the osteosarcoma-derived Saos-2, kidney rhabdoid tumor-derived G401, and rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cell lines.To verify that the expression constructs to be utilized in functional assays of transcriptional activity encoded proteins of the expected size, synthetic RNAs were generated by in vitrotranscription of pcDNA3 constructs and used to program rabbit reticulocyte lysates for in vitro translation in a coupled system. As shown in Fig. 2, the apparent molecular weight of the [35S]methionine-labeled WT1 isoforms containing exon 5-encoding sequences (WT1 +/− and +/+) was ∼54 kDa, and the size of the exon 5-lacking WT1 variants (WT1 −/+ and −/−) was ∼52 kDa.Figure 2In vitro transcription/translation analysis of WT1 isoforms. T7 RNA polymerase-driven in vitro transcription reactions were performed using the TNT® quick-coupled transcription/translation system. Each reaction included 1 μg of each of the following expression vectors: WT1 +/−, WT1 −/+, WT1 +/+, WT1 −/−, and empty pcDNA3. In vitrotranslation reactions were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine using rabbit reticulocyte lysates. 1 μl of each translation reaction (out of a total volume of 50 μl) was electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE gels and exposed for 20 h to Kodak X-Omat film.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate the ability of the various naturally occurring WT1 isoforms to regulate the activity of the IGF-IR promoter in a p53-independent manner, p53-null Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with a series of expression vectors containing or lacking alternatively spliced exon 5 and 9 sequences (WT1 +/+, +/−, −/+, and −/−), together with the reporter plasmid p(−476/+640)LUC, which contains most of the proximal region of the rat IGF-IR promoter. The results of co-transfection experiments in Saos-2 cells are presented in Fig. 3. The WT1 −/− isoform induced a significant dose-dependent decrease in promoter activity (37 ± 3.9% inhibition with 1.5 μg of the expression plasmid and 65 ± 2% inhibition with 2.5 μg). These results replicate our previous data using pCB6-derived as well as pcDNA3-derived constructs in Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Werner H., Re, G.G. Drummond I.A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J.

Roberts C.T., Jr. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4713-4724Google Scholar). Transfection of the WT1 +/− isoform inhibited promoter activity by 34 ± 6% at 2.5 μg of input DNA, whereas the KTS-containing variants, WT1 +/+ and −/+, had a limited effect on IGF-IR promoter activity.Figure 3Regulation of IGF-IR promoter activity by WT1 isoforms in Saos-2 cells. 5 μg of the p(−476/+640)LUC reporter plasmid were co-transfected into Saos-2 cells, along with increasing amounts of WT1-KTS (+/− and −/−) (A) or WT1+KTS expression vectors (−/+ and +/+) (B) (or empty pcDNA3) and 2.5 μg of the pCMVβ plasmid using the calcium phosphate method.

Saos-2 cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of the WT1 −/− expression vector, and after 72 h, cells were lysed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cell lysates (50 μg) were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE gels, after which they were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The upper half of each membrane was incubated with an anti-IGF-IR β-subunit antibody, and the lower half was incubated with an anti-WT1 antibody. Results of Western blot analysis of transfected cells showed that increasing amounts of WT1 induced a dose-dependent decrease in the endogenous levels of IGF-IR (Fig. 4). Maximal suppression (∼90% inhibition) was seen with 6 μg of WT1 expression plasmid.Figure 4Effect of WT1 expression on endogenous IGF-IR gene expression. Saos-2 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of a WT1 −/− expression vector, and after 72 h, cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and blotted with an anti-WT1 antibody (upper panel) or with an anti-IGF-IR antibody (lower panel).

Neither of the two KTS-containing isoforms (−/+ and +/+) inhibited the IGF-IR promoter in G401 cells (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Regulation of IGF-IR promoter activity by WT1 isoforms in G401 cells. G401 cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of the p(−476/+640)LUC IGF-IR reporter construct, together with 0–4 μg of WT1-KTS (−/− and +/−) (A) or WT1+KTS (−/+ and +/+) (B) and 0.25 μg of pCMVβ, using the Fugene-6 reagent.

The (10)1 cell line was clonally derived from Balb/c-3T3 cells; thus, both lines share a common genetic background (27Harvey D.M. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, 1.5 μg of WT1 −/− suppressed promoter activity in Balb/c-3T3 cells by 82%, whereas the same amount of vector repressed activity in (10)1 fibroblasts only by 17%. With 2.5 μg of DNA, WT1 −/− induced a further decrease in activity in (10)1 cells to 27%. In addition, co-transfections were performed in the human colorectal cancer cell lines HCT116 +/+, containing wild-type p53, and HCT116 −/−, in which the p53 gene has been disrupted by targeted homologous recombination (28Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Google Scholar). In these cells, the inhibitory effect of the KTS-lacking WT1 +/− isoform on IGF-IR promoter activity was also significantly enhanced in p53-expressing compared with p53-null cells, although the differences between p53-containing and p53-lacking cells were less pronounced than those seen between Balb/c-3T3 and (10)1 cells (51 ± 4 versus 21 ± 3% inhibition at 0.05 μg of expression vector and 58 ± 6versus 38 ± 4% at 0.1 μg of DNA) (Fig. 7 A). Interestingly, the KTS-containing WT1 −/+ isoform had a similar effect in HCT116 −/− and +/+ cells (Fig. 7 B).Figure 6Effect of p53 background on WT1 action.Murine Balb/c-3T3 (open bars) and (10)1 (closed bars) fibroblasts were transfected with 5 μg of the p(−476/+640)LUC reporter plasmid, together with 0, 1.5, or 2.5 μg of a WT1 −/− expression vector, and 2.5 μg of pCMVβ, using the GenePORTER reagent.

In these cells, neither WT1 −/− nor WT1 −/+ affected promoter activity to a significant extent (Fig. 8 A). To more rigorously compare the differential effects of wild-type and mutant p53, triple transfections were performed in Saos-2 cells using the p(−476/+640)LUC reporter, together with the WT1 −/− plasmid (0.25 μg) and minimal amounts (50 ng) of wild-type or codon 248-mutated (pC53–248W) p53 vectors. The rationale for using such low doses of WT1 and p53 was to minimize the individual effect of each tumor suppressor (18Werner H. Karnieli E. Rauscher III, F.J. LeRoith D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8318-8323Google Scholar). Furthermore, we chose the codon-248 mutant to replicate the p53 status in RD cells. As shown in Fig. 8 B, WT1 −/− suppressed promoter activity by 24%, whereas in the presence of wild-type p53, the inhibitory effect increased to 39%. On the other hand, WT1 −/− had essentially no effect in the presence of a mutant p53 (2% inhibition).Figure 8Regulation of IGF-IR promoter activity by WT1 in the presence of mutant p53. A, RD cells were transfected with 1 μg of the p(−476/+640)LUC construct, together with 0–2 μg of WT1 −/− or −/+ expression vectors, and 2.5 μg of pCMVβ, using the Polyfect reagent. Luciferase values, normalized for β-galactosidase, are expressed as a percentage of the luciferase activity of the empty pcDNA3 expression vector. Experiments were repeated between three and five times, each in duplicate. B, Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with the p(−476/+640)LUC reporter, along with 0.25 μg of WT1 −/− (or empty pcDNA3) and 50 ng of wild-type or codon 248-mutant p53 (or empty pCMV-Neo-Bam vector). Shown are the results of a typical experiment, performed at least six times, each in duplicate dishes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In addition to analyzing the wild-type splice variants of WT1, we assessed the transcriptional activities of the naturally occurring DDS- and WAGR-associated mutant versions of WT1. For this purpose, transient co-transfections were performed in Saos-2 cells using the p(−476/+640)LUC IGF-IR promoter-luciferase reporter construct, together with increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding either +/+ or −/− variants of the DDS- and WAGR-associated proteins. Interestingly, both +/+ and −/− isoforms of the DDS-associated mutant (harboring a point mutation in the DNA binding domain) and of the WAGR mutant (displaying a point mutation in the middle portion of the molecule) suppressed the activity of the IGF-IR promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, 2.5 μg of DDS −/− induced a 64% decrease, whereas DDS +/+ induced a smaller, albeit significant, decrease (35%) (Fig. 9 A). At the same DNA concentration, WAGR +/+ and −/− mutants suppressed promoter activity by 60 and 45%, respectively (Fig. 9 B).Figure 9Regulation of IGF-IR promoter activity by DDS - and WAGR-associated mutant WT1 proteins. 5 μg of the p(−476/+640)LUC reporter plasmid were co-transfected into Saos-2 cells together with increasing amounts of expression vectors encoding DDS +/+ and −/− (A) or WAGR +/+ and −/− (B) and 2.5 μg of pCMVβ. Luciferase data were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Experiments were repeated between two and five times, each in duplicate.

Park S. Bernard A. Morris J. Rauscher III, F. Hill D. Haber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Google Scholar), we undertook a series of experiments aimed at establishing whether the functional cooperation between p53 and WT1 isoforms in our cellular systems was similarly associated with specific protein-protein interactions. For this purpose, Saos-2 cells were transiently transfected with 3 μg each of expression vectors encoding WT1 −/− and pcDNA3-HA-p53 (or empty pcDNA3-HA vector). After 24 and 48 h, cells were harvested, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-WT1 monoclonal antibody (F6), and the precipitates were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, complexes were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blotted with an anti-p53 monoclonal antibody (DO-1). As shown in Fig. 10 A, immunoblotting with the p53 antibody identified p53 in anti-WT1 immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with WT1 −/− and pcDNA3-HA-p53 but not in cells transfected with WT1 −/− and empty pcDNA3-HA. On the other hand, co-transfection of mutant p53 (pC53–248W) did not result in WT1/p53 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 10 B).Figure 10Co-immunoprecipitation of p53 and WT1. A, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with 3 μg of an expression vector encoding WT1 −/− and 3 μg of pcDNA3-HA-p53 (or empty pcDNA3-HA vector). 24 and 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody F6, a monoclonal antibody against WT1. Precipitates were loaded onto 8% SDS-PAGE gels, electrophoresed, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes that were blotted with an anti-p53 antibody. Thearrow denotes the position of p53. B, Saos-2 cells were cotransfected with 3 μg of a WT1 −/− vector, together with 3 μg of expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant (codon 248) p53. After 24 h, cells were harvested and processed as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To examine whether p53 expression has an effect on WT1 levels, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding WT1 −/− or −/+, together with a p53 expression vector (or empty vector). After 48 h, nuclear extracts were prepared, and WT1 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting. The results obtained showed that the levels of WT1 were significantly increased in the presence of p53 (Fig. 11 A). To assess whether a similar effect can be seen in the presence of endogenous p53 and to determine whether p53 improves WT1 stability or its nuclear translocation, whole cell and nuclear extracts were prepared from HCT116 −/− and +/+ cells that were transfected with 0, 1, or 3 μg of a WT1 −/− vector. As shown in Fig. 11 B, WT1 abundance was increased in both whole cells and in the nuclei of p53-containing cells (compare lane 2 versus lane 5 and lane 3 versus lane 6). To examine the effect of mutant p53, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with a WT1 −/− vector (or empty vector), together with expression vectors encoding wild-type or mutant (codon 248) p53 (or empty vector). Results of Western blotting showed that cotransfection of wild-type p53 increased the abundance of both endogenous WT1 (compare lane 2 versus lane 1) and exogenously added WT1 (compare lane 5 versus lane 4). On the other hand, mutant p53 did not affect the levels of WT1 (compare lane 3 versus lane 1 and lane 6 versus lane 4) (Fig. 11 C).Figure 11Effect of p53 expression on WT1 levels.

https://openalex.org/W2058035176,"Little is known about the mechanisms that organize the internal membrane systems in eukaryotic cells. We are addressing this question in striated muscle, which contains two novel systems of internal membranes, the transverse tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Small ankyrin-1 (sAnk1) is an ∼17-kDa transmembrane protein of the SR that concentrates around the Z-disks and M-lines of each sarcomere. We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to determine whether sAnk1 interacts with titin, a giant myofibrillar protein that organizes the sarcomere. We found that the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain of sAnk1 interacted with the two most N-terminal Ig domains of titin, ZIg1 and ZIg2, which are present at the Z-line in situ. Both ZIg1 and ZIg2 were required for binding activity. sAnk1 did not interact with other sequences of titin that span the Z-disk or with Ig domains of titin near the M-line. Titin ZIg1/2 also bound T-cap/telethonin, a 19-kDa protein of the Z-line. We show that titin ZIg1/2 could form a three-way complex with sAnk1 and T-cap. Our results indicate that titin ZIg1/2 can bind sAnk1 in muscle homogenates and suggest a role for these proteins in organizing the SR around the contractile apparatus at the Z-line.

The contractile cycle in striated muscle normally requires the spread of the action potential along the T-tubules into the interior of the muscle fiber, where depolarization induces the release of Ca2+ from the terminal cisternae of the SR, causing contraction (2Flucher B.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 3Flucher B.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Relaxation follows the re-uptake of Ca2+ into a distinct domain of the SR, which has been referred to as the longitudinal or network SR (4Franzini-Armstrong C. FASEB J. 1999; 13 Suppl. 2: S266-S270PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the network SR is positioned around the Z-disks and M-lines of each sarcomere, but the structural elements that determine its location have not been determined. Early ultrastructural studies demonstrated the presence of numerous filaments joining the periphery of sarcomeric Z-disks to adjacent SR membranes (5Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1994: 176-199Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of these structures remains elusive. We have searched for protein partners of small ankyrin-1 (sAnk1), a muscle-specific isoform of the erythroid ankyrin-1 gene that is concentrated in the network SR of striated muscle fibers, surrounding the Z-disks and M-lines (6Zhou D.

Titin is a giant (∼2.7–4 MDa) protein that extends from the Z-disk to the M-line within the sarcomere, which it helps to organize.

In the I-band, titin (∼800 kDa to 1.5 MDa) carries proline/glutamate/valine/lysine-rich sequences, which confer great extensibility to the titin filaments (35Linke W.A. Stockmeier M.R. Ivemeyer M.

At the junction of the I-band with the Z-disk, titin interacts with the actin thin filaments, although it is still unclear which titin motifs mediate this interaction (45Linke W.A. Ivemeyer M.

The two most N-terminal Ig domains of titin, which are constitutively expressed in all titin isoforms and reside in the periphery of the Z-disk, bind a recently identified, 19-kDa protein of striated muscle, referred to as T-cap or telethonin (47Gregorio C.C.

Titin has two functions in striated muscle: as a “molecular blueprint” for sarcomeric protein assembly during myofibrillogenesis and as a “molecular spring” that maintains myofibrillar integrity during contraction, relaxation, and stretch (27Trinick J.

Our results show that, in addition to binding T-cap, the two N-terminal Ig domains of titin interact specifically with sAnk1, suggesting that titin also coordinates the assembly of the contractile apparatus with the network SR that surrounds the Z-disk. PCR amplification was used to obtain cDNAs encoding fragments of the Z-disk (∼80 kDa) (47Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunkle K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1411-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) portions of titin. cDNA from human cardiac muscle (Origene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) was used as template, and the following sets of custom oligonucleotide primers were generated, based on the sequence of human cardiac titin (GenBankTM/EBI accession number X90568). For amplification of ZIg1/2, the two most N-terminal Ig domains of titin, primers A (5′-ACGTGAATTCATGACAACTCAAGCACCG-3′, sense) and B (5′-ACGTCTCGAGAGGTACTTCTTCTTCACC-3′, antisense) were used. For ZIg1/2-A (including ZIg1 only), the sense primer A was used in combination with the antisense primer C (5′-ACGTCTCGAGAGCTTTCACGAGAAGCTC-3′). For generation of ZIg1/2-B (containing ZIg2 only), primer D (5′-ACGTGAATTCGAGACAGCACCACCCAAC-3′) was used along with the antisense primer B. For ZIg3, the Ig domain just C-terminal to ZIg1/2, primer E (5′-ACGTGAATTCGCTAAAAAGACAAAGACA-3′, sense) was utilized in combination with primer F (5′-ACGTCTCGAGCATTATTGCTTCTTGAGT-3′, antisense). For amplification of Zr (forZ-repeat), the region of titin that interacts with α-actinin, primer G (5′-ACGTGAATTCAAGGAAACTAGGAAAACA-3′, sense) was used with primer H (5′-ACGTCTCGAGGACAGTCACATTTTTTAA-3′, antisense). For ZIg4/5, immediately following the Z-repeat region, primers I (5′-ACGTGAATTCATAGAAGGTGAATCTGTC-3′, sense) and J (5′-ACGTCTCGAGTCCATGCTTATTGCGAAC-3′, (antisense) were used. For generation of MIg1/2, the first two Ig domains in the M-line region of titin, primer K (5′-ACGTGAATTCGGTGAAAATGTCCGGTT-3′, sense) was used with primer L (5′-ACGTCTCGAGCCCAGCTGTGTTAGT-3′, antisense). For MIg5/6, two additional Ig domains in the M-line region of titin, primer M (5′-ACGTGAATTCCTGACCTGTGTGGTTGAA-3′, sense) was utilized in combination with primer N (5′-ACGTCTCGAGTCCAGCTGAATTTTTTAC-3′, antisense). All sense primers carried an EcoRI recognition sequence, whereas all antisense primers contained an XhoI site for insertion into the yeast two-hybrid pB42AD prey vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and the pGEX4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) for production of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The titin ZIg1/2 fragment was also introduced into the pMAL-c2X vector atEcoRI/SalI sites (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) (XhoI and SalI sites have compatible ends). Similarly, a fragment encoding the C-terminal hydrophilic sequence of sAnk1-(29–155) (25Birkenmeier C.S. Sharp J.J. Gifford E.J. Deveau S.A. Barker J.E. Genomics. 1998; 50: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) was inserted into the yeast two-hybrid pLexA bait vector and the pGEX4T-1 vector atEcoRI/XhoI sites after PCR amplification with primers 1 (5′-ACTGGAATTCGTCAAGGGTTCCCTGTGC-3′, sense) and 2 (5′-ACTGCTCGAGCTGCTTGCCCCTTTT, antisense). An identical set of primers carrying EcoRI and SalI recognition sites was used for insertion into the pMAL-c2X vector to produce a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion peptide. Additional sets of primers were used for amplification of sAnk1 deletion constructs. For sAnk1-A, the sense primer 1 was used in combination with the antisense primer 3 (5′-ACTGCTCGAGTTGTTCCTCTGTCAC-3′). For generation of sAnk1-B, the sense primer 4 (5′-ACTGGAATTCTTCACAGACGAACAG-3′) was used with the antisense primer 2. For sAnk1-C, primer 5 (5′-ACTGGAATCATCTCCACCAGGGTG-3′, sense) was used with primer 6 (5′-ACTGCTCGAGTCCACTCCCTCTTAG-3′, antisense). For generation of MBP-T-cap fusion protein, the full-length pET9D-T-cap plasmid (a generous gift from Drs. S. Labeit (European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) and C. C. Gregorio (University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ)) was used as template to obtain a PCR fragment that contained amino acids 1–140 (47Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunkle K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Primers 7 (5′-ACGTGAATTCATGGCTACCTCAGAGCTG-3′, sense) and 8 (5′-ACGTGTCGACTCATGTCTCCAGCGCCAG-3′, antisense), carryingEcoRI and SalI sites, respectively, were used for insertion into the pMAL-c2X vector. T-cap-(1–140) was also introduced into the pGEX4T-1 vector at EcoRI/XhoI sites (XhoI and SalI have compatible ends) to produce a GST fusion protein. The authenticity of the obtained constructs was verified by sequencing analysis. GST and MBP recombinant polypeptides were expressed by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h and purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose (for GST fusion proteins) (Amersham Biosciences) or amylose resin (for MBP fusion proteins) (New England Biolabs, Inc.) columns following the manufacturers' instructions. The Matchmaker LexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. The pB42AD prey vector and the pLexA bait vector were used to express titin (i.e. ZIg1/2, ZIg1/2-A, ZIg1/2-B, Zr, ZIg3, ZIg4/5, MIg1/2, and MIg5/6) and sAnk1 (i.e. sAnk1-(29–155), sAnk1-A, sAnk1-B, and sAnk1-C) hybrid peptides, respectively, as described above. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 was sequentially transformed with reporter p8op-lacZ, bait, and prey plasmids. True transformants were selected by plating on induction medium (i.e. synthetic dropout Gal/Raf lacking Ura, His, Trp, and Leu) in the presence of 80 mg/liter 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Liquid β-galactosidase assays were performed as described in the Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook using chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate. For each interaction tested, four independent colonies were assayed, and each experiment was repeated twice. Results represent average values. Homogenates of quadriceps muscle of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (Zivic-Miller Laboratories, Inc., Zelienople, PA) were prepared at room temperature for 2–3 min with a Brinkmann Polytron homogenizer at setting 3 (VWR, West Chester, PA) in 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaN3, 120 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal amounts of recombinant GST and GST-ZIg1/2, GST-Zr, GST-ZIg3, GST-ZIg4/5, GST-MIg1/2, and GST-MIg5/6 fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose and mixed with 0.5 mg of quadriceps muscle homogenate at 4 °C for 16 h. Beads were washed in the cold with 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20 and heated for 5 min at 90 °C in 2× SDS Laemmli sample buffer. The soluble fraction was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibodies to sAnk1. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection kit (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). The blot overlay assays were performed as previously described with minor modifications (51Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos A. Huang S.-C. Benz E.J., Jr. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼2.5 μg of bacterially expressed, affinity-purified GST and GST-ZIg1/2 proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Nonspecific sites on the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Tween 20) plus protease inhibitors for 3 h at 25 °C and then incubated with 3 μg/ml MBP-sAnk1 fusion protein in the same buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed five times (15 min each) with buffer A and once with buffer B (1× phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 10 mmNaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20). Subsequently, they were incubated in buffer C (1× phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 10 mm NaN3, 0.1% Tween 20, and 3% dry milk) and probed with antibodies to sAnk1, diluted in buffer C. In a set of parallel assays, increasing concentrations of affinity-purified GST-ZIg1/2 fusion protein (i.e. 5 and 10 μg) were added to buffer A along with MBP-sAnk1, and blots were processed as just described. Equivalent amounts of GST protein, GST-sAnk1, and GST-T-cap bound to glutathione matrices were allowed to interact with 5 μg of recombinant MBP-ZIg1/2, MBP-sAnk1, or MBP-T-cap in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaN3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, and 10 mmmaltose plus protease inhibitors) for 12 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the supernatants were removed, and the glutathione beads were extensively washed with a solution containing 50 mmTris (pH 7.2), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaN3, and 0.1% Tween 20. In a parallel set of experiments, GST-sAnk1 and GST-T-cap attached to glutathione matrices were initially allowed to interact with 5 μg of bacterially expressed MBP-ZIg1/2 for 12 h at 4 °C. Following removal of the supernatants, 5 μg of affinity-purified MBP-T-cap or MBP-sAnk1 were added to the GST-sAnk1·MBP-ZIg1/2 or GST-T-cap·MBP-ZIg1/2 complexes, respectively, and allowed to interact for another 12 h in the cold. At the end of the incubation period, the glutathione beads were washed four times (15 min each) and dissolved in 2× SDS Laemmli sample buffer. The soluble proteins were fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Frozen longitudinal sections and cross-sections of quadriceps muscle of adult rats were prepared as previously described (52Williams M.W. Resneck W.G. Kaysser T. Ursitti J.A. Birkenmeier C.S.

Sections were incubated in buffer D (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% normal donkey serum, and 10 mm NaN3) for 1–2 h at 25 °C. Primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-titin-x112/x113 (3 μg/ml; a generous gift from Dr. C. C. Gregorio), rabbit anti-sAnk1 (3 μg/ml) (6Zhou D. Birkenmeier C.S. Williams M.W. Sharp J.J.

Following extensive washing with the same buffer, samples were counterstained with the appropriate secondary antibodies, including Alexa-568 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-488 donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), in buffer D at 1:100 dilution for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, sections were washed three times (15 min each), mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), and analyzed with a Zeiss 410 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Tarrytown, NY) equipped with a ×63 NA 1.4 objective. Unless otherwise noted, all reagents were from Sigma and were the highest grade available. sAnk1 is an ∼17–19-kDa integral membrane protein of the network SR that has a 126-amino acid sequence extending into the sarcoplasm surrounding Z-disks and M-lines (6Zhou D. Birkenmeier C.S. Williams M.W. Sharp J.J. Barker J.E. Bloch R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).2 We used the yeast two-hybrid assay to test the idea that the hydrophilic sequence of sAnk1 (sAnk1-(29–155)) interacts with the giant myofibrillar protein titin, which spans each half-sarcomere from the Z-disk to the M-line. We inserted cDNA encoding the hydrophilic cytoplasmic domain of sAnk1 (sAnk1-(29–155)) (25Birkenmeier C.S. Sharp J.J. Gifford E.J. Deveau S.A. Barker J.E. Genomics. 1998; 50: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) into the yeast two-hybrid pLexA bait vector (Fig. 1 A) and assayed its ability to interact with the N-terminal ∼80-kDa portion of titin that resides in the Z-line (47Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunkle K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), expressed by a series of constructs inserted into the yeast two-hybrid pB42AD prey vector (Fig. 1 B). Specifically, the PCR products of titin we assayed were ZIg1/2 (amino acids 1–200), ZIg3 (amino acids 201–557), the Z-repeats or Zr domain (amino acids 558–910), and ZIg4/5 (amino acids 911–1118) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Yeast two-hybrid analysis followed by qualitative liquid β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1 C) indicated that sAnk1-(29–155) specifically interacted with the two most N-terminal Ig domains of titin, ZIg1/2 (amino acids 1–200), which reside at the edge of the Z-disk (28Furst D.O.

No specific association between sAnk1-(29–155) and the remaining ∼60-kDa portion of Z-disk titin could be detected (Fig. 1 C). In additional tests of the specificity of the interaction with ZIg1/2, we generated two additional “prey” constructs encoding tandem Ig domains that reside in the M-line region of titin (37Obermann W.M.

The IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis) comprise a family of proteins that oppose caspases and thus act to raise the apoptotic threshold. Disruption of IAP-mediated caspase inhibition has been shown to be an important activity for pro-apoptotic proteins inDrosophila (Reaper, HID, and Grim) and in mammalian cells (Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2). In addition, in the case of the fly, these proteins are able to stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of IAPs by a mechanism involving the ubiquitin ligase activity of the IAP itself. In this report, we show that the Drosophila RHG proteins (Reaper, HID, and Grim) are themselves substrates for IAP-mediated ubiquitination. This ubiquitination of Reaper requires IAP ubiquitin-ligase activity and a stable interaction between Reaper and the IAP. Additionally, degradation of Reaper can be blocked by mutating its potential ubiquitination sites. Most importantly, we also show that regulation of Reaper by ubiquitination is a significant factor in determining its biological activity. These data demonstrate a novel function for IAPs and suggest that IAPs and Reaper-like proteins mutually control each other's abundance.

Although apoptosis research has revealed a plethora of signaling pathways that can contribute to the decision of a cell to die, the ultimate responsibility for completing the cell death program (in most cases) resides with the cysteine proteases known as caspases (reviewed in Refs. 1Hengartner M.O.

Caspase-mediated cleavage of cellular substrates underlies many of the ordered processes that occur as the dying cell shrinks, degrades its DNA, and packages the remains for subsequent phagocytosis. As such, regulation of caspase activation is a key control point for the apoptotic machinery. Acting in opposition to the caspases are the IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis). These proteins function, at least in part, by directly binding to and inhibiting active caspases (Refs. 4Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M., Wu, Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P.

Many of the IAPs also contain a RING finger domain, and like other RING finger proteins, these IAPs can function as ubiquitin ligases (9Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D.

Ubiquitin ligases work in conjunction with ubiquitin-activating and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes to covalently link ubiquitin to lysines present in the target protein. Sequential linkage of multiple ubiquitin moieties (polyubiquitination) then results in targeting of the ubiquitinated protein for destruction by the proteasome (reviewed in Ref. 11Hershko A.

Although it is well established that IAPs can inhibit caspases through physical binding, the significance of IAP ubiquitin-ligase activity for the anti-apoptotic function of IAPs is not yet fully understood. For example, IAPs have been reported to ubiquitinate and promote the degradation of caspases, which could clearly favor cell survival (9Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D.

Conversely, IAPs can auto-ubiquitinate and thereby promote their own destruction, which might be expected to favor cell death (9Huang H. Joazeiro C.A. Bonfoco E. Kamada S. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. J.

In Drosophila, the caspase-inhibiting function of IAPs is antagonized by the pro-apoptotic proteins Reaper, HID, and Grim (the RHG1 proteins). The genes encoding these proteins are closely linked, and their combined deletion results in a generalized failure of apoptosis during development of theDrosophila embryo (18White K. Grether M.E. Abrams J.M. Young L. Farrell K. Steller H. Science. 1994; 264: 677-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Expression of these proteins is tightly controlled at the level of transcription, and ectopic expression of the RHG proteins in either insect or vertebrate cells can initiate apoptosis (19Chen P.

Although Reaper, HID, and Grim do not share overall homology, they do share a short region at their extreme N termini that is responsible for binding IAPs (the so-called RHG motif). The interaction between the RHG motif and the IAP has been suggested to preclude the IAP/caspase interaction, thereby alleviating caspase inhibition (27Fesik S.W. Shi Y.

As a consequence, these proteins can directly bind and inhibit IAPs in a manner similar to that of Reaper, HID, and Grim. Recently, we and others have reported that Reaper, HID, and Grim can also promote apoptosis by stimulating IAP ubiquitination and degradation (12Wilson R. Goyal L. Ditzel M. Zachariou A. Baker D.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Both IAP ubiquitin-ligase activity and the RHG motif are required for this particular interaction, but it is not yet clear whether other regions of the RHG protein or the IAP will also be required. Moreover, although Smac and Omi bind IAPs, there have been no reports that they also stimulate IAP degradation. In this report, we provide evidence that the interaction between the IAPs and the RHG proteins is a two-way street with regard to ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation; that is, not only do the RHG proteins stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of IAPs, but the IAPs also stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of the RHG proteins. Our data demonstrate that the RHG motif is required for IAP-mediated degradation of Reaper, which suggests that a stable interaction between Reaper and the IAP is required for this form of regulation. Moreover, Reaper degradation can be blocked by inhibiting the proteasome, and when Reaper is stabilized by mutating potential ubiquitination sites, it becomes a markedly more potent inducer of apoptosis. Collectively, these data indicate that IAP regulators such as Reaper are targeted for degradation by IAP ubiquitin-ligase activity, and that this regulation is a significant factor in determining their biological activity. The following genetic crosses were used to generate the imaginal discs in Fig. 1: EnG4 × UAS-P35 (panels A and D), EnG4 × UAS-HID, UAS-P35 (panels B, E, and G), and EnG4 × UAS-Rpr, UAS-P35 (panels C, F,H, and I). DIAP1 and HID proteins were detected by indirect antibody fluorescence using the appropriate antibodies and standard techniques. HID and Reaper RNAs were detected by hybridization of digoxigenin-labeled probes, followed by dye staining. DIAP1D20E was prepared as described previously (43Wang S.L. Hawkins C.J. Yoo S.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) from GST-TEV-DIAP1D20E followed by TEV cleavage. pET23a-Reaper-GST was expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) per the manufacturer's instructions. HID-His6 and Grim-His6 were purified as described previously (17Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I., Yu, H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). All of the proteins for in vitro ubiquitination assays were dialyzed against the buffer UD (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) before use. Drosophila embryo extract was made as follows. 0–5-h-old embryos were collected and aged for 6 h at 25 °C. The embryos were dechorionated with 50% bleach, rinsed, suspended in equal volumes of buffer EX (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.25 m sucrose) and homogenized. The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 ×g. The concentration of the extract was ∼10 μg/μl. The ubiquitination assay was carried out as follows. Hid-His6, Reaper-GST, or Grim-His6 protein (100 ng each) was preincubated with 1 μl of embryo extract at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, DIAP1D20E (400 ng) and His-ubiquitin (Calbiochem; 3 μg total) were added in buffer UR (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 40 min and stopped by adding SDS sample buffer. The ubiquitination of each protein was visualized after separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride, and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibody. Anti-Reaper serum was obtained by standard immunization techniques using New Zealand White rabbits and a synthetic Reaper C-terminal peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Research Genetics). The sequence used for peptide synthesis was CHPKTGRKSGKYRKPSQ. Reaper was cloned into pcDNA3 by standard techniques. Further work required removal of a vectorMscI site; thus Reaper/pc3 was digested withPvuII and recircularized. The oligonucleotides (GATCCATGGCAGTGGCATTCTACATACCCGATCAGGCGACTCTGTTGCGGGAGGCGGAGCAGAGGGAGCAGCAGATTCTCCGCTTGCGGGAGTCACAGTGGAGATTCCTGG; CCAGGAATCTCCACTGTGACTCCCGCAAGCGGAGAATCTGCTGCTCCCTCTGCTCCGCCTCCCGCAACAGAGTCGCCTGATCGGGTATGTAGAATGCCACTGCCATG; CCACCGTCGTCCTGGAAACCCTGCGCCAGTACACTTCATGTCATCCGAGGACCGGAAGAAGGTCCGGCAGATATCGCAGGCCATCGCAAT; and CTAGATTGCGATGGCCTGCGATATCTGCCGGACCTTCTTCCGGTCCTCGGATGACATGAAGTGTACTGGCGCAGGGTTTCCAGGACGACGGTGG) were hybridized and cloned separately into Reaper-pcDNA3ΔPvuII to generate clones A (N-terminal mutant) and B (C-terminal tetra-mutant). ReaperKR was generating by splicing the BamHI/MscI fragment from clone A into clone B above, and this insert was subcloned into the various vectors indicated. A variant of pcDNA3 was generated in which a c-Myc epitope tag was cloned downstream of the MCSXbaI site. The Reaper open reading frame minus its stop codon was cloned in frame with the Myc tag of pcDNA3-myc using standard techniques to generate Reaper-Myc. A variant of pSP64T, anin vitro SP6 expression vector with flanking 5′ and 3′ β-globin untranslated region and a polyadenosine tail was generated called pSP64BN. The BglII cloning site of pSP64T was replaced with an oligonucleotide encoding the multiple cloning site of pEBB, including unique BamHI and NotI sites. ReaperKR-FLAG, Reaper-FLAG, Reaper, and ReaperΔ1–15 were subcloned into pSP64BN by standard techniques. To produce radioactive protein for half-life assays, Reaper-myc, Reaper, ReaperΔ1–15, Reaper-FLAG, ReaperKR-FLAG, Cdc25, and Grp94 templates were added at 20 ng μl−1 to rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Stratagene) containing 1 μCi μl−1 of S-35 Translabel (ICN), 1× ((−)-cysteine, (−)-methionine) amino acid mix and other components per manufacturer's protocol. Translated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, soaked in 1 m salicylic acid for 1 h, dried, and exposed to Biomax MR film (Kodak). To assay protein stability, 100 μg ml−1 cycloheximide was added to translated proteins, which were then incubated at 30 °C for an additional 30 and 60 min, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and processed as above. All of the cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. Details of cell culture, vector constructs, immunoblotting, affinity precipitations, and pulse-chase analysis were as previously described (14Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), with the following exceptions. HEK 293T cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish for immunoblotting experiments and 200,000 cells/well in 6-well dishes for pulse-chase analysis and apoptosis assay. The cells were transfected 24 h after plating using a standard protocol of calcium phosphate and HEPES-buffered saline. 10-cm dishes were transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA, and 6-well plates were transfected with a total of 1.6 μg of DNA/well. Where indicated, the proteasome inhibitor LLnL (ALLN, Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 20 μm for 45 min prior to harvesting cells. When appropriate, the cells were harvested by rinsing once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysing the cells on ice with buffer IP (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40, plus 1× Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular)). Bead-bound material following affinity precipitation was washed three times with buffer IP prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting or autoradiography. The apoptosis-inducing ability of Reaper and ReaperKR was assayed by co-transfecting pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) with the vectors indicated. After 48 h, live cells (as determined by forward and side scatter) were analyzed for GFP fluorescence by flow cytometry. Each transfection was performed in duplicate, with and without 50 μm zVAD-fmk (Biomol) to inhibit caspase activation, for a total of four transfections/construct. The percentage of live GFP+ cells for each construct in the absence of zVAD-fmk was normalized to the percentage of live GFP+ cells in the presence of zVAD-fmk such that the results shown indicate caspase-dependent loss of GFP+ cells while correcting for any differences in transfection efficiency between constructs. All of the cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen unless otherwise specified. SL2 cells were obtained from the ATCC via the Duke Cell Culture Facility and were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone). For transfection, 3 × 106 cells (at 5 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded in T-25 flasks. 24 h later, DNA was prepared for transfection by mixing 20–30 μg of appropriate constructs with 62 μl of 2 m CaCl2 and 438 μl of sterile water. 500 μl of 2× HEPES buffered saline was bubbled in to each sample over 1 min. DNA mixtures were allowed to sit for 30 min at room temperature and were then added to cells for 16–24 h, after which cells were pelleted and resuspended in fresh medium. Enhanced GFP was subcloned into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of pCasper3, downstream of the ubiquitin promoter, using standard techniques. Wild type Reaper and ReaperKR were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pMT, downstream of the metallothionine promoter, using standard techniques. SL2 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of GFP and 20 μg of pMT vector, Reaper, or ReaperKR. After 24 h, the cells were pelleted at 1,000 × g for 5 min and then resuspended in fresh medium. Following an additional 24 h, Reaper or ReaperKR was induced with 70 nm CuSO4, and the cells were incubated at 25 °C for 3 days. FACS analysis was then performed. Transfection efficiency was controlled for by normalizing each transfection to its percentage of GFP (+) in the presence of zVAD-fmk. Each transformation was analyzed in triplicate (for a total of 18 samples: nine with zVAD-fmk and nine without). Forward and side scatter were used to gate viable cells, with the same gate settings used for all samples. 100,000 gated cells/sample were counted and then analyzed for GFP fluorescence using FACS ANALYZER (BD). Cells with >102 GFP signal were taken as positive. The percentage of survival for sample A was calculated as [%GFP(+)A − zVAD-fmk]/[%GFP(+)A + zVAD-fmk]. The average percentage of GFP(+) was calculated, and the standard deviations for each sample were used to determine error. Full-length or Δ1–15 reaper-GFP fusions were generated by overlap PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′ reaper, GAAGGAGGATCCATGGCAGTGGCATTCTACATACCC; 5′ overlap, TATCGCAAGCCATCGCAAAGATCTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG; 3′ overlap, CTCGCCCTTGCTCACCATAGATCTTTGCGATGGCTTGCGATA; and 3′ GFP, CCTCCGGATCCCTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCGAG. Fusion open reading frames were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pMT, downstream of the metallothionine promoter, using standard techniques. pIE3-DIAP-HA was a gift from Kristin White (Harvard/MGH). 10 μg of DIAP and 20 μg of full-length or Δ1–15 reaper-GFP were transfected into SL2 cells as described above. 24 h after resuspension in fresh medium, GFP fusions were induced with 700 nm CuSO4 and placed into 50 μmzVAD-fmk to prevent cell death. After 16 h of induction, the cells were pelleted, washed with fresh medium, and resuspended in medium lacking copper but supplemented with 50 μm zVAD-fmk. The cells were immediately subjected to FACS analysis as above, with additional analyses at 16 and 24 h. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate as above. The averages were calculated for each sample, and the standard deviations were used to determine error. The percentage of Reaper remaining in the presence of DIAP1 = [+D]/[no D] where [+D] = [% GFP(+) with DIAP at time T]/[% GFP(+) with DIAP at time 0], and [no D] = [% GFP(+) without DIAP at time T]/[% GFP(+) without DIAP at time 0]. Our previous work and that of others have shown that the interaction between IAPs and Reaper (and Grim and HID) lowers cellular IAP levels by stimulating ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the IAPs (12Wilson R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). In the course of these experiments involving Reaper, HID, and DIAP1, we noticed that overexpression of Reaper in Drosophila imaginal discs led not only to lower DIAP1 levels but also to elevated levels of HID as detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1,A–F). The reciprocal experiment examining Reaper protein levels in the presence of HID overexpression was uninformative because of the inability of our Reaper antibodies to detect Reaper in situ. To eliminate the possibility that Reaper expression was affecting HID transcription (Fig. 1 F), we analyzed the amount of HID mRNA by in situ hybridization and found that there was no increase in the amount of HID message (Fig. 1 H). These results implied that the regulation of Reaper and HID levels were somehow linked at a post-transcriptional step. This seemed particularly significant in light of the fact that the Reaper, HID, and Grim proteins all play a key role in developmental and radiation-induced apoptosis in Drosophila, but there have been no published reports on post-transcriptional mechanisms controlling the abundances of these proteins. Although an effect on translational regulation remained a possible explanation for the elevated HID levels, this seemed unlikely because Reaper has been shown to suppress rather than enhance translation (14Holley C.L. Olson M.R. Colon-Ramos D.A. Kornbluth S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,17Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I., Yu, H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M. Clem R.J. Muller H.A. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, we had also noted that Reaper immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both Reaper and a human IAP (XIAP) contained a prominent 18-kDa species recognized by anti-Reaper immunoblotting. Given the established link between the RHG proteins, IAPs, and ubiquitin-mediated degradation, we strongly suspected that this species was monoubiquitinated Reaper. Indeed, the 18-kDa band evident in the Reaper immunoblot of the anti-Reaper immunoprecipitate was also recognized by anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2 A). Given thatDrosophila IAP-1 (DIAP1) is the physiologically relevant IAP with regard to Reaper, we repeated these experiments with Reaper and DIAP1 with similar results (Fig. 2 A). We then transfected cells with Reaper and either XIAP or DIAP1 and looked for Reaper-ubiquitin conjugates in the IAP immunoprecipitate. We detected multiple ubiquitinated species at 9-kDa intervals above the 9-kDa nonubiquitinated Reaper (Fig. 2 B, black arrowheads). Importantly, these protein species were absent when cells were transfected with Reaper and an XIAP RING finger point mutant (H467A) that lacks ubiquitin ligase activity. Note also that only the 18- and 27-kDa species could be detected in the anti-Reaper immunoblot because the Reaper antibody was prepared against an extreme C-terminal peptide from Reaper, where four of five ubiquitin-modifiable lysines are located (see Fig. 5 A). As such, it is likely that multiubiquitination of Reaper was interfering with antibody binding. The presence of ubiquitinated Reaper species in the IAP co-precipitate suggested that Reaper might be a substrate of IAP ubiquitin-ligase activity. Additionally, we suspected that the RHG protein HID might also serve as a substrate for IAP-mediated ubiquitination because our initial experiment showed that HID levels increased as DIAP1 levels were lowered by Reaper (Fig. 1). To prove that Reaper and HID could in fact serve as substrates for IAP-mediated ubiquitination, we performedin vitro ubiquitination reactions with recombinant forms of these proteins. These results show clearly that Reaper and HID are substrates for DIAP1-stimulated ubiquitination (Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, we found that Grim is also ubiquitinated in vitro (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that all three of theseDrosophila RHG proteins may be regulated"

We constructed three antibody mutants (l-Y50F, l-S91A, and l-S93A) and investigated the interactions between the mutant Fvs and HEL. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicated that the mutations significantly decreased the negative enthalpy change (8–25 kJ mol−1), despite some offset by a favorable entropy change. X-ray crystallography demonstrated that the complexes had nearly identical structures, including the positions of the interfacial water molecules. Taken together, the isothermal titration calorimetric and x-ray crystallographic results indicate that hydrogen bonding via interfacial water enthalpically contributes to the Fv-HEL interaction despite the partial offset because of entropy loss, suggesting that hydrogen bonding stiffens the antigen-antibody complex.

Specific recognition of ligands by proteins is fundamentally important in biological phenomena. Recent high resolution x-ray crystallographic determinations of the structures of various protein-protein complexes have shown that protein-protein interfaces are generally characterized by a high degree of both shape and charge complementarity (1Lo Conte L.

The specificity and affinity of protein-protein interactions are in principle created by the complementarity of the interface surfaces, which allows the formation of various noncovalent bonds (hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals interactions) (1Lo Conte L.

The combination of thermodynamic data with structural results should be a powerful tool for the precise description of the mutant Fv-HEL interactions.In the wild-type Fv-HEL complex, Kondo et al. (36Kondo H. Shiroishi M. Matsushima M. Tsumoto K. Kumagai I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27623-27631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) observed 12 water molecules bridging the imperfect antigen-antibody interface (Fig. 1). Kondo's x-ray crystallographic study indicated that the temperature factor (B factor) of these water molecules is small, and thus, the contribution of these solvent water molecules to the Fv-HEL interaction is assumed to be significant. Therefore, thermodynamic analyses of mutant Fv-HEL interactions combined with structural analyses of the Fv-HEL complexes should give further insight into the molecular basis for the role of hydrogen bond formation via interfacial water molecules in the interaction. In this report, we have focused on three residues (Tyr50, Ser91, and Ser93) in the light chain. These residues participate in the formation of the hydrogen bond network (Fig. 1 B), and thus, the mutational analyses should give further insight into the role of the hydrogen bonds.Here, using isothermal titration calorimetry and x-ray crystallography, we report the effect on complex formation of truncating atoms of antibody side chains participating in hydrogen bond formation via water molecules. On the basis of our thermodynamic and structural results, we discuss the role of the hydrogen bonds in the protein antigen-antibody interaction.RESULTSSecretory Expression, Preparation, and Spectral Properties of Mutant Fv FragmentsTo determine the energetic contribution of hydrogen bonds bridging the imperfect interface of the HyHEL-10 Fv-HEL complex to the antigen-antibody interaction, three mutants (l-Y50F,l-S91A, and l-S93A) were constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. The mutant Fv fragments were purified by affinity chromatography using HEL-Sepharose, followed by gel filtration on Superdex 75 pg. Purities of greater than 95% were obtained by this procedure. The final yield of each mutant was greater than 10 mg/liter of culture.The peptide and aromatic circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the mutants under the native condition (pH 7.2, 25 °C) were measured to examine the effect of mutation on the conformational stability. Comparison of these CD spectra with those of the wild-type (WT) revealed no differences in the far- and near-UV CD spectra of the wild-type Fv and mutant Fv fragments (data not shown), indicating that the secondary and tertiary structures of the mutants are quite similar to the structure of WT. Thus, the mutations have no significant influence on the overall structure.Inhibition of Enzymatic Activity of Hen Lysozyme by MutantsTsumoto, Kumagai, and co-workers (37Ueda Y. Tsumoto K.

Thus, we investigated the inhibition of the enzymatic activity of HEL by three mutants (l-Y50F, l-S91A, andl-S93A) (Fig. 2).Figure 2Inhibition of lysozyme enzymatic activity by HyHEL-10 Fv.

These results also suggest that the overall structures, including the interfacial areas (water molecules), of the mutant Fv-HEL complexes are almost the same as the overall structure of the wild-type Fv complex.Local Structural Changes Observed in Mutant Fv-HEL Complexesl-Y50F Mutant-HEL ComplexAlthough significant structural changes occurred around sites 17–19 of the antigen HEL in the l-Y50F Fv-HEL complex, no structural differences were observed around other sites, including the mutated site (Fig. 6). In addition, the locations of the interfacial water molecules were unchanged. Thus, two hydrogen bonds involving the hydroxyl group of Tyr50 in CDR-L2 were removed because of the mutation, and no structural changes involving interfacial water molecules and the same number of hydrogen bonds as wild-type were observed.Figure 6Comparison of local structures in thelY50F-HEL and WT-HEL complexes.

One water molecule was newly introduced into the mutation site (W3; the ‖ 2F 0 − F 1 ‖ electron density map of the WT-HEL complex around l-S91A is shown in Fig. 7 A, and the corresponding region of the l-S91A-HEL complex is shown in Fig. 7 B), bridging l-Asn32,l-His34, and a water molecule (W13, corresponding to W2 in the wild-type complex), and this new water molecule contributed to the formation of the hydrogen-bonding network at the interface. The B factor of the newly introduced water molecule (W3) is estimated to be 12.5, which is smaller than the average value (16.8) of the Cα chains of the complex. Thus, two hydrogen bonds have been increased, and no other structural changes have been induced because of the mutation.Figure 7Comparison of local structures in -S91A-HEL and WT-HEL complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2053768267,"To better understand G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) signaling, cellular and animal physiology, as well as gene therapy, a new tool has recently been proposed. It consists of GPCR mutants that are insensitive to endogenous ligands but sensitive to synthetic ligands. These GPCRs are called receptor activated solely by synthetic ligands (RASSL). Only two examples of such engineered receptors have been described so far: one Gi-coupled (opioid receptors) and one Gs-coupled (β2-adrenergic receptors). Here, we describe the first RASSL related to serotonin receptors (D100(3.32)A Gs-coupled 5-HT4 receptor or 5-HT4-RASSL). 5-HT4-RASSL is generated by a single mutation, is totally insensitive to serotonin (5-HT), and still responds to synthetic ligands. These ligands have affinities in the range of nanomolar concentrations for the mutant receptor and exhibit full efficacy. More interestingly, two synthetic ligands behave as antagonists on the wild type but as agonists on the 5-HT4-RASSL.

G-protein-coupled receptor receptor activated solely by synthetic ligands Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium dialyzed fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 are the most numerous and the most diverse type of receptors (1Bockaert J. Claeysen S. Becamel C. Pinloche S. Dumuis A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 212: 63-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 2Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar). They transduce messengers as different as odorants, nucleotides, nucleosides, peptides, lipids, or proteins. Eight families of GPCRs are classified according their sequences, their binding domains to ligands, and their ability to activate similar sets of G-proteins. The heterotrimeric (α, β, γ) G proteins are divided into four families based on the nature of their Gα subunits (Gαi, Gαs, Gαq, Gα12–13). Each one couples to a distinct class of receptors and signals through a specific pathway. A series of pathologies have been found to be related to the mutation of GPCRs. These changes lead either to a loss or a gain of function, such as blindness, diabetes insipidus, and hypo- or hyperthyroidism (3Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Depressed GPCR signal transduction is related to numerous complex diseases. Heart failure and asthma are associated with a decrease in the Gs-signaling pathway, whereas an increase in Gi signaling is a potential cause of dilated cardiomyopathy). The concept that modified GPCRs could be used as tools to better understand GPCR-controlled signal transduction pathways in a given cell or organ or for gene therapy has recently been proposed (5Coward P. Chan S.D. Wada H.G. Humphries G.M. Conklin B.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Scearce-Levie K. Coward P. Redfern C.H. Conklin B.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 414-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Scearce-Levie K. Coward P. Redfern C.H. Conklin B.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 232-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Several types of modified GPCRs have been developed to prepare such tools. The first, engineered by Conklin and collaborators (8Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), were named RASSL for “receptor activated solely by synthetic ligands.” The idea is to engineer receptors that would be insensitive to their endogenous ligand(s) but can be fully activated by synthetic ligands. Among the GPCRs, only the κ opioid receptors have been modified so far by Conklin's group (8Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) to produce two opioid receptor-RASSLs, Ro1 and Ro2. Ro1 was constructed by substituting the second extracellular loop of the κ opioid receptor with the corresponding portion of the human δ opioid receptor. This substitution induced a lower affinity for the endogenous peptide ligands (including dynorphin) without significantly reducing the response to κ synthetic ligands, like spiradoline (8Coward P. Wada H.G. Falk M.S. Chan S.D. Meng F. Akil H. Conklin B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The specificity of Ro1 for the synthetic ligands was further enhanced in Ro2 by substituting glutamine for Glu297 in Ro1. More recently, a second type of mutant GPCR the “therapeutic receptor-effector complex” (or “TREC”) was proposed to be a biotechnological tool to study GPCR signal transduction (9Small K.M. Brown K.M. Forbes S.L. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31596-31601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor mutated in 19 positions and fused with Gαs was not activated by β-adrenergic agonists, but only by a non-biogenic amine agonist, L156870, although with relatively low potency. In this report, we describe a third example of RASSL type receptors: a mutant serotonin receptor, the 5-HT4 receptor. 5-HT4 receptors are Gs-coupled receptors expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, human and pig atria, urinary bladder, adrenal medulla, and central nervous system including limbic areas (olfactory tubercles, limbic system, basal ganglia) (10Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Baumgarten H.G. Göthert M. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Serotoninergic Neurons and 5-HT Receptors in the CNS. Spinger-Verlag, Berlin1997: 439-465Google Scholar). Over the past 10 years, the pharmacology and structure of 5-HT4receptors have been extensively studied (10Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Baumgarten H.G. Göthert M.

Martin R.S. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25502-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One of the interesting characteristics of this receptor is its ability to be activated by a wide range of compounds from very different chemical classes (13Clark R.D. Eglen R.M. 5-HT4 Receptors in the Brain and Periphery. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 1-48Crossref Google Scholar). Some are used in clinic to treat gastroparesis, dyspepsia gastro-esophageal reflux, or irritable bowel syndromes. The 5-HT4 agonists are related to tryptamines like 5-HT, to carbazimidamides (HTF-919 or Zelmac), benzamides (metoclopramide or PrimperanTM, cisapride or “PrepulsidTM,” benzoates (SL 10302), benzimidazolones (BIMU8), or aryl ketones (for reviews, see Refs. 10Bockaert J.

The demonstration that tryptamines and benzamides have different pharmacophores (14Buchheit K.H. Gamse R. Giger R. Hoyer D. Klein F. Klöppner E. Pfannküche H.J. Mattes H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 2326-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) prompted us to generate mutant 5-HT4receptors with the aim of disrupting the 5-HT recognition site, keeping the recognition site for synthetic 5-HT4 agonists. The mutant was generated by exchanging the endogenous residue Asp100 to Ala in the m5-HT4(a)R cDNA sequence with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sense primer used was: D100A, 5′-ACC TCT CTGGCT GTC CTA CTC ACC-3′. The cDNAs, subcloned into the pRK5 vector, were introduced into COS-7 cells by transfection. In summary, cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in EP Buffer (50 mm K2HPO4, 20 mm CH3CO2 K, 20 mm KOH, 26.7 mm MgSO4, pH 7.4) with 25–2000 ng of receptor cDNA. The total amount of cDNA was kept constant at 15 μg per transfection with pRK5 vector. After 15 min at room temperature, 300 μl of cell suspension (107 cells) were transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation receptacle (Bio-Rad, Ivry sur Seine, France) and pulsed with a gene pulser apparatus (setting 1000 microfarads, 280 V). Cells were diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; 106 cells/ml) containing 10% dialyzed and decomplemented fetal bovine serum (dFBS) and plated on 15-cm Falcon Petri dishes or into 12-well clusters at the desired density. Six hours after transfection, the surrounding cell medium was exchanged for DMEM without dFBS with 2 μCi of [3H]adenine/ml to label the ATP pool and incubated overnight (16 h). cAMP accumulation was measured, as described previously (15Dumuis A. Bouhelal R. Sebben M. Cory R. Bockaert J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 34: 880-887PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared from transiently transfected cells plated on 15-cm dishes and grown in DMEM with 10% dFBS for 6 h, followed by incubation for 20 h in DMEM without dFBS. The cells were washed twice in PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, harvested in PBS, and centrifuged at 4 °C (200 × g for 4 min). The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.32m sucrose and homogenized 10 times with a glass-Teflon potter at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (5 mg of protein in 1 ml of solution) and stored at −80 °C until use. Saturation experiments were performed using the specific 5-HT4 receptor radioligand [3H]GR 113808 at height concentrations ranging from 0.048 to 0.51 nm. The 5-HT4 receptor binding site density was estimated with [3H]GR 113808 at a saturating concentration (0.5 nm), as described previously (16Ansanay H. Sebben M. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 298: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 5-HT (5 × 10−5m) or RS 100235 (10−7m), a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, was used to determine nonspecific binding. Protein concentration in the samples was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Competition and saturation experiments were analyzed by non-linear regression curves using the computer program LIGAND (17Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). Saturation experiments were also analyzed according to Scatchard. IC50 values required to displace 50% of [3H]GR 113808 binding sites were converted toK D values, according to the equationK D = IC50/1 + S/K DS(18Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar), where S is [3H]GR 113808 concentration, andK DS is the equilibrium constant of [3H]GR 113808. Using Kaleidagraph software, the dose-response curves were fitted according to the following equation.Y=((ymax−ymin)/1+(x/EC50)nH))+yminEquation 1 where EC50 (or EC50inv) is the concentration of agonist (or inverse agonist) that evokes a half-maximal response, y max andy min correspond to the maximal and minimal responses, respectively, and nH is the Hill coefficient. Data were compared using the Stat-View Student program (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA) with t tests. The following drugs were used: GR 113308 (1-[2-(methylsulfonylamino)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl 1-methyl-indole-3-carboxylate), HTF- 919 (5-methoxy-indole-3-carboxaldehyde 4-pentyl-iminosemicarbazone), BIMU8 (endo-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)-2-oxo-3-isopropyl-2,3-dihydro-1Hbenzimidazole-1-carboxamide), (S)-zacopride ((S)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzamide monohydrochloride), cisapride (cis-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-3-methoxy-4-piperidinyl]-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzamide, metoclopramide (N-(2-dimethylamino)ethyl)-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamide), renzapride ((±)-endo-N-(1-azabi-cyclo[3.3.1]non-4-yl)-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzamide mo- nohydrochloride), SB 204070 ((1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl 8-amino-7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxane-5-carboxylate), ML 10302 (2-(1-piperidinyl)ethyl-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate), ML 10375 (2-(cis-3,5-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl)ethyl4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate), RS 67333 (1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-(1-butyl-4-piperidinyl)-1-propanone), RS 100350 (N-[2-[4-[3-(8-amino-7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-yl)-3-oxopropyl]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide), RS 124523 (1-(8-amino-7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-yl)-3-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-4-piperidinyl]-1-propanone), RS 47431 (1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-phenyl)-3-[1-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl)propyl]-4-piperidinyl]-1-propanone), and RS 100235 (1-(8-amino- 7-chloro-1,4-benzodioxan-5-yl)-3-[1-[3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)propyl]-4-piperidinyl]-1-propanone). First, we wanted to render the receptor unresponsive to 5-HT, but responsive to synthetic 5-HT4 agonists. Based on Strader's work on β-adrenergic receptors and on many other biogenic amine receptors (19Strader C. Fong T. Tota M. Underwood D. Dixon R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar), the key interaction between 5-HT4receptors and 5-HT should obviously occur at the highly conserved Asp residue found in TM-III within the biogenic amine receptor family. In the 5-HT4 receptor this Asp is at position 100 in TM-III (Asp100(3.32)). This Asp residue is believed to interact with the positively charged nitrogen of the neurotransmitter protonated amine. Indeed, the mutation of Asp100(3.32) to alanine in the 5-HT4 receptor totally abolished the 5-HT stimulation of cAMP accumulation (11Mialet J. Dahmoune Y. Lezoualc'h F. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Hoebeke J. Sicsic S. Langlois M. Fischmeister R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 12Joubert L. Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bessis A.S. Clark R.D. Martin R.S. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25502-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), as well as the stimulation by other tryptamines (5-CT or 5-MeOT) or by a substituted indole carbazimidamide (HTF-919) (Fig. 1, A and B) (TableI). Compared with 5-HT, HTF-919 has a guanidine function instead of a protonated amine in the indole side chain (20Buchheit K. Gamse R. Giger R. Hoyer D. Klein F. Klöppner E. Pfannfucke H. Mattes H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, when we mutated other well conserved residues within the biogenic amine receptor family and likely to be involved in the 5-HT binding pocket (Ser197(5.43), Trp272(6.48), and Phe275(6.51)), none were able to totally suppress the 5-HT or HTF-919 responses. 5-HT has a 50–500-fold reduced affinity for F275A, W272A, and S197A, with no change in the maximal 5-HT stimulation (12Joubert L. Claeysen S. Sebben M. Bessis A.S. Clark R.D. Martin R.S. Bockaert J. Dumuis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25502-25511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Table I5-HT4 receptor drug efficiency on WT and D100(3.32)A mutant 5-HT4 receptorEfficiency was determined in cAMP accumulation experiments in COS-7 cells transiently expressing either 5-HT4(a) and mutant D100(3.32)A receptors at the same level of receptor density (about 2500 fmol/mg proteins). The results are expressed as percentages of 5-HT-induced cAMP accumulation via the 5-HT4 WT receptors and BIMU8-induced cAMP accumulation via the 5-HT4-R D100(3.32)A mutant receptors.

The chemical structures of some of the 5-HT4receptor drugs tested in this study are shown. Open table in a new tab Efficiency was determined in cAMP accumulation experiments in COS-7 cells transiently expressing either 5-HT4(a) and mutant D100(3.32)A receptors at the same level of receptor density (about 2500 fmol/mg proteins).

Data are the means ± S.E. values of three experiments performed in triplicate (see “Experimental Procedures”). The chemical structures of some of the 5-HT4receptor drugs tested in this study are shown. Interestingly, and in contrast to other biogenic amine receptors (9Small K.M. Brown K.M. Forbes S.L. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31596-31601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mutation of the conserved Asp100(3.32) only moderately affected the specific 5-HT4R radioligand, [3H]GR 113808 (K D = 0.17 ± 0.08 nm and 0.38 ± 0.09 nm at WT and D100(3.32)A receptors, respectively) (Fig. 1 D). Using [3H]GR 113808 binding, we verified that 5-HT was unable to bind the 5-HT4 D100(3.32)A receptor (Fig 1 C). The binding of [3H]GR 113808 was the first indication that ligands, which include the basic nitrogen of the aromatic ring side chain, in a structured ring, associated with an increase in the distance between this basic nitrogen and the main aromatic ring of the compound, suppressed the requirement of the Asp100(3.32) carboxylic group for ligand binding. This was confirmed when we screened most of the non-tryptamine 5-HT4 receptor agonists for their ability to activate the 5-HT4 D100(3.32)A receptor. BIMU8, a specific 5-HT4 agonist structurally very different from 5-HT, belonging to the azabicycloalyl benzymidazolone class (21Dumuis A. Sebben M. Monferini E. Nicola M. Ladinsky H. Bockaert J. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1991; 343: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was found to be a potent agonist. As shown in Fig. 2, this compound remained fully active and even showed higher efficacy and potency on the D100A mutant than on the WT (EC50 values for cAMP stimulation were 4 ± 1.5 and 1 ± 0.5 nm for WT and D100A, respectively) (Fig. 2 A). The affinity of BIMU8 for the 5-HT4receptor was also slightly better on the D100A mutant than on the WT.K D values for BIMU8, measured by competition with the [3H]GR 113808 radioligand, were 30 ± 11 nm and 6.5 ± 3 nm for WT and D100A, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, the benzamides bearing the 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro substitution (renzapride, S-zacopride, or cisapride) were equi-effective on the WT and the D100(3.32)A mutant (Table I) with nanomolar affinity. A slight decrease in their potency on the mutant D100A receptor was observed. These data suggest that the D100(3.32)A mutant could still be activated as long as the agonist could bind the receptor. Furthermore, this mutation had no effect on the receptor expression level. Two drugs were antagonists on WT and agonists at the D100(3.32)A mutant. Benzoate derivatives bearing the 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro-substitution (ML 10302) (22Langlois M. Zhang L. Yang D. Brémont B. Shen S. Manara L. Croci T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 1433-1436Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and the related aryl ketones (RS 67333, RS 124523, RS 100350, RS 47431) (13Clark R.D. Eglen R.M. 5-HT4 Receptors in the Brain and Periphery. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998: 1-48Crossref Google Scholar) were partial agonists on 5-HT4 WT receptors. As shown in TableI, they were more efficacious on 5-HT4 D100(3.32)A receptors than on WT. Another benzoate derivative, reported to be either a highly specific 5-HT4 antagonist (ML 10375) (23Yang D. Soulier J.L. Sicsic S. Mathe-Allainmat M. Bremont B. Croci T. Cardamone R. Aureggi G. Langlois M. J. Med. Chem. 1997; 40: 608-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or an inverse agonist on the 5-HT4 receptor (24Blondel O. Gastineau M. Langlois M. Fischmeister R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), was indeed an antagonist of WT 5-HT4 receptors (Fig. 3 C), which became a full agonist on the 5-HT4 D100(3.32)A mutant (EC50 = 1 ± 0.6 nm) (Fig. 3, A and C). This encouraged us to screen the putative agonist properties of a series of 5-HT4 antagonists. We found that the known GR 113808 antagonist (Fig. 3 C) used for 5-HT4receptor studies (25Grossman C.J. Kilpatrick G.J. Bunce K.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 109: 618-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) was a highly potent (EC50 = 0.17 ± 0.04 nm) and efficacious agonist on D100(3.32)A receptor (Fig. 3 B). Compared with the previously described β2-adrenergic Gs-coupled RASSL (9Small K.M. Brown K.M. Forbes S.L. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31596-31601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the 5-HT4 RASSL has the advantage of being stimulated by synthetic compounds of much higher affinity (micromolar for β2-adrenergic RASSL and nanomolar for 5-HT4 RASSL). The structure-activity relationships and the structural analyses of the 5-HT4 receptor ligands used in this study are consistent with a recent report on comparative receptor mapping of 5-HT4 binding sites (26Lopez-Rodriguez M.L. Murcia M. Benhamu B. Viso A. Campillo M. Pardo L. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The authors proposed structural insights to assist the design of selective 5-HT4 receptor ligands. The structural features that define the 5-HT4ligands are an aromatic moiety, a coplanar carbonyl, carboxyl or ketone function, and a basic nitrogen atom. The substitute of the basic nitrogen must be voluminous (as in all the active drugs acting on the 5-HT4 RASSL) to interact in an hydrophobic pocket of the receptor. The size of the substitute improves selectivity and potency. One of our hypotheses is that the basic nitrogen of these drugs interacts within the hydrophobic pocket, with a negative charge, but not with Asp(3.32). In contrast, this Asp is necessary for the binding of the protonated primary amine of 5-HT derivatives. The affinity of the voluminous substituted ligands for the 5-HT4 RASSL (structures in Table I) would depend of the interactions between their hydrophobic rings and the hydrophobic pocket, defined by highly conserved aromatic residues in TMVI and VII (Trp(6.48), Phe(6.51), and Tyr(7.43)) (11Mialet J. Dahmoune Y. Lezoualc'h F. Berque-Bestel I. Eftekhari P. Hoebeke J. Sicsic S. Langlois M. Fischmeister R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Roth B.L.

The above results indicate that the D100(3.32)A Gs-coupled 5-HT4 receptor described here is the first RASSL related to serotonin receptors and that it has unique properties not found in two previously described RASSL receptors (5Coward P. Chan S.D. Wada H.G. Humphries G.M. Conklin B.R. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 7Scearce-Levie K. Coward P. Redfern C.H. Conklin B.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 232-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). RASSL is generated by a single mutation and is completely insensitive to its endogenous agonist: 5-HT. RASSL can be stimulated by numerous synthetic agonists from different chemical classes. Many of these synthetic ligands have a nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT4 RASSL, and some of them can be administered orally such as cisapride or metoclopramide. Cisapride has been used for years to treat dyspepsia and gastro-esophageal reflux and has only been removed from the market because of one second effect (arrhythmia probably caused by action on K+ channels) (29Kii Y. Ito T. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Kaumann A.J. Lynham J.A. Brown A.M. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 353: 592-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, other benzamides are being developed and will certainly be used in humans. Interestingly, RS 67333 was found to be another potent agonist of 5-HT4 RASSL. This compound possesses a great ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Antagonist compounds (ML 10375 and GR 113808), which are highly specific on the native receptor, exhibit agonist properties on the 5-HT4 RASSL. GR 113808 is also able to cross the blood-brain barrier. ML 10375 and GR 113808 will be particularly interesting for in vivo stimulation of 5-HT4RASSL. Indeed, with these compounds, native 5-HT4 receptors can be kept silent, while generating a Gs signal by activating 5-HT4 RASSL, expressed in a given tissue at a given developmental time, by bioengineering in animals and possibly in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1965225383,"Previous characterization of Escherichia coli endonuclease IV has shown that the enzyme specifically cleaves the DNA backbone at apurinic/apyrimidinic sites and removes 3' DNA blocking groups. By contrast, and unlike the major apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease exonuclease III, negligible exonuclease activity has been associated with endonuclease IV. Here we report that endonuclease IV does possess an intrinsic 3'-5' exonuclease activity. The activity was detected in purified preparations of the endonuclease IV protein from E. coli and from the distantly related thermophile Thermotoga maritima; it co-eluted with both enzymes under different chromatographic conditions. Induction of either endonuclease IV in an E. coli overexpression system resulted in induction of the exonuclease activity, and the E. coli exonuclease activity had similar heat stability to the endonuclease IV AP endonuclease activity. Characterization of the exonuclease activity showed that its progression on substrate is sensitive to ionic strength, metal ions, EDTA, and reducing conditions. Substrates with 3' recessed ends were preferred substrates for the 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Comparison of the relative apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease and exonuclease activity of endonuclease IV shows that the relative exonuclease activity is high and is likely to be significant in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1971315655,"Previously, we determined the crystal structures of the dimeric ligand binding region of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 1. Each protomer binds l-glutamate within the crevice between the LB1 and LB2 domains. We proposed that the two different conformations of the dimer interface between the two LB1 domains define the activated and resting states of the receptor protein. In this study, the residues in the ligand-binding site and the dimer interface were mutated, and the effects were analyzed in the full-length and truncated soluble receptor forms. The variations in the ligand binding activities of the purified truncated receptors are comparable with those of the full-length form. The mutated full-length receptors were also analyzed by inositol phosphate production and Ca2+ response. The magnitude of the ligand binding capacities and the amplitude of the intracellular signaling were almost correlated. Alanine substitutions of four residues, Thr188, Asp208, Tyr236, and Asp318, which interact with the α-amino group of glutamate in the crystal, abolished their responses both to glutamate and quisqualate. The mutations of the Tyr74, Arg78, and Gly293 residues, which interact with the γ-carboxyl group of glutamate, lost their responsiveness to glutamate but not to quisqualate. Furthermore, a mutant receptor containing alanine instead of isoleucine at position 120 located within an α helix constituting the dimer interface showed no intracellular response to ligand stimulation.

Glutamate released into the synaptic space is recognized by two distinct receptors, glutamate-gated ion channels and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)1 (1Nakanishi S. Masu M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 2Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). The mGluRs consist of eight subtypes (mGluR1 to -8), which couple with a variety of effector systems, including inositol phosphate pathway, adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, etc. The mGluRs are considered to modulate synaptic neurotransmission and thus to play roles in memory, learning, and brain disorders such as epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. The mGluR consists of three regions: a large extracellular region, a seven-transmembrane-spanning region, and an intracellular region. Previously, we determined the crystal structures of the extracellular ligand-binding region (LBR) of mGluR1 (3Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). In combination with biochemical studies (4Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S.

Each protomer consists of an LB1 domain and an LB2 domain. The glutamate-binding structure is a dimer composed of closed and open protomers, which differ in the relative orientation of the LB1 and LB2 domains. Without glutamate, two crystal forms of m1-LBR were obtained; one form exists as an open-open dimer, and the other is an open-closed form. The two main functioning sites were then elucidated: the ligand-recognition site and the LB1 dimer interface. In the ligand binding site, glutamate interacts mainly with 13 amino acid residues from the LB1 and LB2 domains of the protomer. We proposed that the ligand-binding domain of mGluR1 is in dynamic equilibrium between the activated state and the resting state, which are defined mainly by the different dimer interface conformations of the three crystal forms. An antagonist binding crystal structure, which was recently solved (6Tsuchiya D. Kunishima N. Kamiya N. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2660-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), maintained the resting dimer conformation, supporting our proposal. Recently, numerous dimer formation studies of G-protein-coupled receptors have suggested a potential level of receptor complexity and diversity (7Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, the precise structural basis of the dimer formation has not been established. In this context, mGluR1, which is considered to be a type C G-protein-coupled receptor (8Böckaert J. Pin J.-P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), is unique in that its extracellular dimer interface has been defined structurally, as described above, and hence provides an opportunity to investigate the functional role of dimerization. Here, in order to elucidate the significance and the contribution of the individual amino acid residues in ligand binding and the correlation with intracellular events, such as inositol phosphate (IP) formation and subsequent Ca2+ responses, we have analyzed the functions of mutant receptors with amino acid mutations of the ligand-binding residues. Furthermore, we also mutated the residues within the helices forming the LB1 dimer interface and analyzed the effects of the mutations. One of the dimer interface mutants lost the Ca2+ response to ligand stimulus, indicating the critical role of dimer interface relocation in receptor activation. l-Quisqualic acid was purchased from Tocris Cookson Ltd.

Cells were grown to 90–95% confluence before the transient transfection. The transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. On day 3 after transfection, cells and culture medium were harvested to examine expression and ligand binding. The conditioned medium from m1-LBR-producing HEK 293 cells was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 20 min, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter, and loaded on a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column. The column was washed with 10 ml of PBS, and the bound material was eluted with PBS containing 200 mm imidazole. Aliquots of the eluate were analyzed by a ligand binding assay. Transfected cells (15-cm dishes) were suspended in ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 320 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, benzamidine, and trypsin inhibitor) and were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was homogenized with 20 strokes of a Potter-Elvehjem type homogenizer in 3 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer and was centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to pellet the membranes. The membranes were divided into aliquots and were stored at −80 °C until use. The proteins within the culture medium and the cell membranes were separated by SDS-PAGE and were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was then blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 3% bovine serum albumin and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-His antibodies (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), AB1551, polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic carboxyl terminus peptide of mGluR1 (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), or the monoclonal antibody mG1Na-1 (4Okamoto T.

The membrane was washed and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Color development was done with a commercial detection kit (Promega). For m1-LBRs, ligand binding was performed with the polyethylene glycol precipitation method, as described previously (10Miyazaki J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 687-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 nm[3H]quisqualate (999 GBq/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) and m1-LBR samples were mixed in 150 μl of binding buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), containing 2.5 mmCaCl2) at 4 °C for 1 h. After the binding reaction, 6-kDa polyethylene glycol was added to the sample to a concentration of 15% with 3 mg/ml γ-globulin. The precipitated material was washed twice with 1 ml of 8% 6-kDa polyethylene glycol and was dissolved in 1 ml of water. After the addition of 14 ml of Scintisol EX-H (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan), the radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. For the mGluR1s, membrane fractions of receptor-expressing HEK 293 cells were incubated with [3H]quisqualate (20 nm) in a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was aspirated onto GF/C filters. The filters were washed with binding buffer, briefly dried, and counted by a scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mml-glutamate. Binding data were analyzed with the Prism 3 software (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Saturation binding curves were fitted to a one-site binding model, andK d and IC50 values were calculated. HEK 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated at 2 × 105/well of a poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plate, and 1 μg of DNA was transfected using 2 μl LipofectAMINE 2000 for 4 h. After transfection, the medium was exchanged with inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (95.0 Ci/mmol) (AmershamBiosciences), and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 16–18 h. The cells were then washed with HEPES-buffered saline (146 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% glucose, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) and were incubated for 30 min with 2 mm pyruvate and 2 units/ml glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (Sigma). After washes with HEPES-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with HEPES-buffered saline containing the agonists and 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of ice-cold 40 mm formic acid, and then the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were loaded onto 1-ml packed volume columns of AG-1-X8 anion exchange gel resin. After loading, the columns were washed with 2 ml of 40 mm NH4OH (pH 9.0) and 2 ml of 40 mm ammonium formate, and the bound material was eluted with 3 ml of 2 m ammonium formate, 0.1m formic acid. This procedure collects inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates (11Paris S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as the ratio of the radioactivity collected in the IP fraction over the radioactivity recovered from the solubilized cellular membranes. The 1330-bp NotI-SfiI fragment of the mutant pcDNAmGluR1s and the 6.3-kbNotI-SfiI fragment of pmGR1 (12Masu M. Tanabe Y. Tsuchida K. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 349: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) were ligated. The resulting plasmids (mutant pmGR1s) and pmGR1 were used as templates for in vitro transcription to yield complementary RNA (cRNA). The plasmid DNA was linearized by NotI, and capped cRNA was synthesized with the MEGAscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected with 10 ng of cRNAs, and incubated for 1–2 days. Current measurements were conducted as previously described (5Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T.

HEK 293 cells were seeded on sterile polylysine-coated coverslips (Asahi Techno Glass Corp., Tokyo, Japan) in a 12-well tissue culture plate (1.6 × 105/well), and were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then transfected with 1.6 μg of either pcDNAmGluR1 or mutant pcDNAmGluR1s and 0.4 μg of pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech) with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000. After 24 h, the cells were loaded for 30–60 min with Fura-2/AM (5 μm) dissolved in balanced salt solution (BSS), containing 135 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 0.9 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), postincubated for 30–60 min in BSS at 37 °C, and maintained in BSS until the assay. About 80% of the cells in the field of view expressed mGluR1, as judged by immunocytochemistry, and almost all of them expressed DsRed2 under these conditions. No significant difference was observed in terms of the [Ca2+]i response with and without pDsRed2 co-transfection (data not shown). Therefore, the fluorescence of DsRed2 through 499 nm was used to detect the transfectant-rich region. The coverslips were mounted in a glass flow chamber with a flow rate of 2 ml/min at 22 °C. The cells were challenged with 100 μmglutamate or 10 μm quisqualate in BSS for 1 min and then were washed free of agonist. 100 μm of carbachol in BSS was perfused for 1 min at the end of each assay in order to confirm the integrity of the IP3/Ca2+ pathway. The chamber was mounted on a Nikon inverted stage microscope. The output from an intensified charge-coupled camera was digitized and stored by a computerized imaging system, Argus 50 (Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K., Hamamatsu, Japan). [Ca2+]i values were calculated from the ratios of sequential 340/380-nm excitation image pairs taken every 5 s by comparison with a standard curve constructed with a Fura-2 calcium imaging calibration kit (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The results are expressed as [Ca2+]i (nm) above the basal level, subtracted from the peak [Ca2+]i. Data analysis was performed using the Prism 3.0 software. HEK 293 cells seeded on sterile polylysine-coated coverslips (IWAKI) were transfected with pcDNAmGluR1 and the dimer interface mutants. After 24 h, the cells were immunoreacted with the monoclonal antibody, mG1Na-1, following the described procedures (13Kitano J. Kimura K. Yamazaki Y. Soda T. Shigemoto R. Nakajima Y. Nakanishi S. J.

Briefly, the cells were washed with PBS and directly immunoreacted with mG1Na-1 in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature without permeabilization. They were washed, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5–10 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum for 1 h. They were immunoreacted with the secondary antibody, fluorescein anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and were visualized using a Carl Zeiss confocal microscope, model LSM510. We constructed mutant receptors containing point mutations in the ligand binding residues, as determined by our crystallographic study (Fig. 1). We have designed two types of receptors: one type is the soluble form of the receptor, including the N terminus to Glu522, just before the start residue of the cysteine-rich sequence ahead of the membrane-spanning domain, and the other is the full-length membrane-bound form of the receptor. Fig. 2 A shows the immunoblot analysis of the mutant proteins expressed in the culture medium of the HEK 293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant soluble form of the receptors. The mutants sS164A, sS186A, sG293A, and sK409A (where the small letter “s” represents the soluble form) were expressed at levels similar to that of the nonmutated soluble form of mGluR1 (sWT) (formerly designated as mGluR114 (5Tsuji Y. Shimada Y. Takeshita T. Kajimura N. Nomura S. Sekiyama N. Otomo J. Usukura J. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol.

The sR78A, sT188A, sD208A, and sY236A mutants were not detected in the culture medium. Although Ser166 does not interact with the ligand in the crystal, the sS166A mutant was made as a control and was expressed well. These soluble forms of the receptors secreted into the culture medium were partially purified on nickel resin, and their ligand-binding capacities were examined, as shown in Fig. 2 B. The partially purified soluble form receptor proteins, sS164A, sS186A, sR323A, and sK409A, exhibited significant [3H]quisqualate binding, as shown in Fig. 2 B. The sY74A and sG293A mutants lost their binding capacities. Since sufficient amounts of purified protein were not obtained from the mutants sR78A, sS165A, sT188A, sD208A, sY236A, sE292A, and sD318A, the binding capacities of these mutants were not estimated. The IC50 values of glutamate for the sS164A and sS186A mutants were comparable with that of the wild type soluble form receptor, as shown in Fig. 2 C and Table II. On the other hand, the sR323A and sK409A mutants showed 1-order of magnitude higher values.Table IIBinding parameters of the ligand-binding site mutantsMutationIC50 of glutamate for [3H]quisqualate bindingK d of quisqualate (mGluR1)m1-LBRmGluR1μmnmWild-type1.2 ± 0.44.5 ± 0.862.4 ± 0.9S164A0.7 ± 0.36.3 ± 2.081.4 ± 16.0S186A1.3 ± 0.27.9 ± 2.5283.6 ± 34.9R323A9.1 ± 1.114.0 ± 5.424.6 ± 3.4K409A15.6 ± 0.427.5 ± 7.124.2 ± 8.4The inhibition of [3H]quisqualate binding to the mutant m1-LBRs and mGluR1s by glutamate was examined. Mutant mGluR1s were also tested in the saturation binding assay. Open table in a new tab The inhibition of [3H]quisqualate binding to the mutant m1-LBRs and mGluR1s by glutamate was examined. Mutant mGluR1s were also tested in the saturation binding assay. Next, the mutant full-length receptors, which possess an amino acid point mutation, were constructed, and their expression and ligand binding capacities were examined. An immunoblot analysis of membrane preparations derived from the cells transfected with plasmids encoding the mutant receptors and the wild type mGluR1 (WT) is shown in Fig. 3 A. Although the R78A, T188A, and Y236A mutants were not detected in their soluble forms, their full-length form mutants were detected in the immunoblot. The D208A mutant was hardly detected. Although the ligand binding values obtained with the membrane preparations in Fig. 3 B were 2–3 orders of magnitude less than those of the soluble forms in the medium (Fig. 2 B) (see pmolversus fmol in the units at the ordinate), the variations in the expression levels among the mutants seem to parallel those of the soluble forms of the mutants. Again, the S164A, S186A, R323A, and K409A mutants showed significant binding values. Furthermore, the glutamate IC50 values for these mutants are strikingly comparable with those for the soluble form mutants, as shown in Fig. 3 C and Table II. These data are compatible and support our previous experiment involving the functional extraction of the ligand binding region without the membrane region (4Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In order to examine the effects of the amino acid mutations in the ligand binding core on intracellular signaling, the enhancement of the IP concentration evoked by glutamate and quisqualate stimuli was investigated in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 4). 1 mm glutamate stimulation of the cells expressing the S164A, S186A, R323A, and K409A mutants evoked IP responses comparable with that of the wild type mGluR1. The responses to the quisqualate stimulation were almost parallel to those of the glutamate stimulation. The S165A and E292A mutants showed an intermediate level response with glutamate. Although a lower glutamate response level was observed with the Y236A mutant, the response with quisqualate was almost lost. Interestingly, in the Y74A and R78A mutants, the response to glutamate was undetectable; however, a significant response to quisqualate was observed. The amplitude of the quisqualate response in the G293A mutant was very small but appears to be significant. No response to either ligand was detected with the T188A, D208A, and D318A mutants, which hardly expressed the soluble form and exhibited weak ligand binding capacities in the full-length forms. In the wild type mGluR1, the IP level before ligand stimulation (white bar) was significantly higher than that in the cells transfected with the vector plasmid alone (mock). Since the so-called basal level of IP production by unliganded mGluR1 expression, also observed in Ref.15Prézeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Böckaert J. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar, was lost in the mutants S165A and E292A, which showed reduced ligand coupling, it seemed that the “basal level” required agonist-like conformational changes. In these mutants, movement of the LB1-LB2 interdomain orientation angle might be restricted at the basal state, and thus the dimer interface relocation, possibly related to closing of at least one protomer, might be hampered. Alterations of the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which are a downstream effect of IP production, were examined, as shown in Fig. 5 A. Glutamate elicited an enhancement of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in cells expressing the S164A, S165A, S186A, E292A, R323A, and K409A mutants as well as the mGluR1 (WT) and the control mutant, S166A. These data are comparable with the increment of the IP concentration in these mutants. Thus, the intermediate level of IP enhancement in the S165A and E292A mutants seems to be significant. These data indicate the different sensitivities between the ligand binding assay and the intracellular Ca2+ measurement. The T188A, D208A, Y236A, and D318A mutants did not show any Ca2+ response. In the Y74A, R78A, and G293A mutants, only quisqualate showed a Ca2+ response. The Ca2+responses in the Y74A and R78A mutants seemed to be comparable with their IP responses. We also examined the membrane currents in oocyte expression systems, as shown in Fig. 5 B. After the injection of cRNAs corresponding to the mGluR1 and its mutants, ligands were applied to the oocytes, and their membrane potentials were measured. The characteristic variation in the amplitude response was somewhat similar to that in the intracellular Ca2+ response. The minor differences were that both ligands elicited membrane currents in Y236A, and quisqualate caused a small response in D318A. In our previous structural studies, the LB1 dimer interface, which mainly consists of helices B and C, is crucial for setting and selecting the activation state in the ligand binding region. Therefore, we mutated the five main amino acid residues in the interface and analyzed their properties. The Leu116 and Ile120 residues are on the B helix, whereas Leu174, Leu177, and Phe178 are on the C helix. Single, double (Leu116/Ile120), and triple (Leu174/Leu177/Phe178) mutants were made and characterized. For these mutants as well as the wild type receptor, an immunoreactive band around 144 kDa was detected (Fig. 6 A)"

In vitro studies of recombinant αII spectrin peptides representing repeats 9–12 identify two sites of pTyr modification.

Although in many instances the role of such modification is well understood, less clear is the impact of protein modification on cytoskeletal dynamics. This is particularly true for spectrin, a large multifunctional scaffolding molecule positioned at the interface between membrane and cytosol. Produced by seven distinct genes, the spectrin family segregates as two subunits, α and β. Heterodimeric αIIβII spectrin is the most common, expressed in most if not all vertebrate cells. By binding to an array of integral membrane and cytosolic proteins and to acidic phospholipids, spectrin links membrane protein and lipid microdomains to the actin and microtubule filamentous skeleton (for a review, see Ref. 1De Matteis M.A. Morrow J.S.

Less clear is whether spectrin can be tyrosine-phosphorylated and whether the α-subunit of spectrin is ever covalently phosphorylated. One report indicates that β-spectrin can be tyrosine-phosphorylated when incubated in vitro with purified insulin receptor kinase (12Kadowaki T. Nishida E. Kasuga M. Akiyama T. Takaku F. Ishikawa M.

Another report has appeared indicating that both spectrin subunits are tyrosine-phosphorylated when incubated in vitro with a spleen protein tyrosine kinase (13Wang C.Y. Kong S.K. Wang J.H. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1254-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A recent report, appearing after the present study was first submitted for publication, indicates that αII spectrin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cultured COS-7 cells in vivo(14Nicolas G.

Other regulatory pathways impacting spectrin include the action of calcium, calmodulin, calcium-activated proteolysis, and the regulation of its Golgi binding by ARF1, a small GTPase. ARF1 acts by modifying phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate levels in Golgi membranes, a substrate for the pleckstrin homology domain of βIΣ2 and βIII spectrin (15Godi A. Santone I. Pertile P.

In the present study we demonstrate that αII spectrin is subject to tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo in cultured Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)2 cells and that such phosphorylation bestows on αII spectrin resistance to the calpain-mediated proteolysis that follows maitotoxin exposure.In vitro studies document at least two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in αII spectrin. One is at the site of calpain cleavage, the other flanks a short sequence encoded by alternative exon utilization. Both sites are adjacent to the SH3 domain of spectrin, a locus that we show binds specifically to c-Src in MDCK cell extracts. Collectively, these data together with a recent independent report that appeared after this study was first submitted (14Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y.

MDCK cells were cultured to confluence with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) as before (34Devarajan P. Stabach P.R. Mann A.S. Ardito T. Kashgarian M. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 819-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In some experiments when blockage of endogenous phosphatase was desired, cells were washed three times with serum-free DMEM and exposed to 0.1 mm pervanadate (freshly prepared from aliquots of 100 mm activated sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) dissolved in water and 100 mm H2O2) in Opti-MEM I at 37 °C for 30 min. Control cells were incubated in Opti-MEM I only. For immunoprecipitation, pervanadate-treated and -untreated MDCK cells were washed three times in ice-cold PBS, lysed gently at 4 °C for 15 min with 1 ml of modified RIPA lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mm, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin in a 1:100 dilution of Calbiochem phosphatase inhibitor mixture set II (catalog number 524625). After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or incubated (0.5 ml) with 3 μl of antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured with 25 μl of packed ImmunoPure® Plus immobilized protein G beads (Pierce) (2 h, 4 °C), washed four times with modified RIPA lysis buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h with either 5% (w/v) dry skim milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) or in blocking buffer (1 mglycine, 5% (w/v) dry skim milk, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 5% (v/v) bovine calf serum). Proteins were detected with primary antibodies in TBST at room temperature for 1 h at a typical dilution of 1:1000 or as specified. The anti-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used at 1:2000. Detection employed goat anti-rabbit/anti-mouse conjugated horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000 and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). MDCK cells were grown to confluence as above and treated with 5 mm activated sodium orthovanadate in Opti-MEM I without H2O2. Cells were then washed with Opti-MEM I one time, and 100 nm maitotoxin (Calbiochem) diluted in Opti-MEM I was applied to cells for various periods at 37 °C. Cells were harvested by washing one time in ice-cold PBS then scraped immediately thereafter into 250 μl of one time sample (4% SDS, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% v/v glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml protease arrest (Calbiochem), 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, 125 mm NaCl). Samples were heated to 100 C° for 20 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The αII spectrin bdp-1 antibody (35Huh G.Y. Glantz S.B. Je S. Morrow J.S. Kim J.H. Neurosci.

Confluent MDCK cells were treated with pervanadate as above at 37 °C and solubilized in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X 100, and 0.1 mm PMSF). This lysate was incubated with GST fusion peptides representing the SH3 domains of αI or αII spectrin or control peptides bound to glutathione-agarose for 3 h at 4 C°, washed four times in above buffer, and placed in sample buffer for immunoblotting with Ant-c-Src (SRC2 Sc-18 Santa Cruz) at 1:1000 dilution in TBST. Oligonucleotides were designed so as to amplify from human αII spectrin cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U26396) by PCR DNA segments encoding six peptides. These peptides correspond to the regions in human αII spectrin derived from repeat units 9–12 and included i) its SH3 domain,alternative insert 1, calpain cleavage site, and its calmodulin-binding domain (peptide SACC, residues 913–1331); ii) its SH3 domain and alternative insert 1 (peptide SA, residues 967–1077); iii) the SH3 domain with the tyrosine downstream of insert 1 (peptide S+, residues 967–1077 (deleting 1053–1072), excluding alternative insert 1); iv) the SH3 domain alone (peptide S, residues 967–1025); v) the calpain cleavage site and the calmodulin-binding domain (peptide CC, residues 1172–1210); and vi) the calmodulin-binding domain alone (peptide C, residues 1181–1210). The oligonucleotides used were: for SACC, forward: 5′-cgcggatccgtgggcagcactgactatggc-3′, reverse: 5′-ccggaattccttgcgctgatctgc-3′; for SA, S, and S+ forward: 5′-gtcggatccaaggagctggtcttggct-3′, SA, reverse: 5′-gcgcggaattcatgatatagttctcccac-3′; for SH3 (S), reverse: 5′-ccggaattccggggtccaatttcttcac-3′; for S+, reverse: 5′-cggaattccttctcacccagttccagcagagaatgatactgattgtcaatctgctcctgccgcagtgc-3′; for CC, forward: 5′-ggatccagggatgaaactgattccaag-3′; for C, forward: 5′-gggatcccaacaggaagtgtatggcatg-3′; for CC and C, reverse: 5′-gggaattctctccttgatggaattaaaggtggc-3′. Amplification products were subcloned into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) and verified by sequencing. Constructs were expressed as fusions with GST and purified using glutathione-Sepharose as before (43Stabach P.R. Cianci C.D. Glantz S.B. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Molar equivalents of recombinant peptides were incubated with 500 μm ATP in 75 mm MnCl2 in kinase reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm DTT) with varying amounts of c-Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) at 30 °C for 3 h. Incorporation of ortho γ-[32P]ATP was measured by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE analysis. Recombinant GST fusion peptides of spectrin were incubated with μ-calpain (Calbiochem) (E/S = 1/600m/m) for 15 min at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. Reaction conditions included 600 μmCaCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 10 mm DTT. When phosphorylated peptides were required, they were prepared by pre-incubation of the recombinant peptide with c-Src (E/S = 1:100 to 1:1000m/m) under conditions as above. The level of phosphorylation was monitored by incorporated 32P or by Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody clone G10 (Upstate Biotechnology). Protein determinations used the Bradford assay (Calbiochem). SDS-PAGE analysis utilized gradient Laemmli polyacrylamide gels. Molecular biology procedures followed standard methods (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine content of αII spectrin in confluent MDCK cells was examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1 A). Immunoprecipitation was conducted under conditions that allow both subunits of the strongly associated spectrin heterodimer (αIIβII) to be precipitated. Spectrin was abundant in the precipitates (Fig.1 A, left panel), and the immunoprecipitated spectrin was reactive with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (P-Y on Fig. 1 A, center panel). The level of anti-pTyr reactivity was increased by pretreatment of the cells with vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, but a phosphotyrosine-modified spectrin was detectable even in untreated cells. While we cannot exclude the presence of trace pTyr in βII spectrin that is also present in these precipitates, the preponderance of pTyr-modified spectrin, identified in multiple experiments (n = 6), appears to be the αII subunit based on the size of the pTyr immunoreactive band at ≈284 kDa. Tyrosine phosphorylation of αII spectrin was also verified by immunoprecipitation with anti-pTyr followed by Western blotting (Fig.1 A, right panel). Anti-pTyr precipitates revealed the clear presence of αII spectrin, as well as a second immunoreactive band at ≈100 kDa. The identity of the latter band is unknown and was not further characterized; it likely represents a tyrosine-phosphorylated proteolytic product of αII spectrin. Although in most experiments the level of αII spectrin proteolysis was low relative to intact spectrin, it was noted that with vanadate treatment, the abundance of a spectrin breakdown fragment at ≈150 kDa was consistently reduced (e.g. the heavily loaded lysate lanes shown in Fig. 1, A and B). This 150-kDa fragment is typically generated by calpain proteolysis of αII spectrin at Tyr1176 (17Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To verify relationship between the level of this spontaneous spectrin break-down product and the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation, the extent of αII spectrin proteolysis was evaluated using an antibody specific for the αII spectrin proteolytic fragment generated by calpain cleavage at Tyr1176 (35Huh G.Y. Glantz S.B. Je S. Morrow J.S. Kim J.H. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 316: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This antibody detected an ≈32% reduction in the level of calpain-cleaved αII spectrin derived from cultured MDCK cells after they had been exposed to vanadate for 30 min (Fig.1 B). To more thoroughly evaluate this putative in vivo protection of αII spectrin from calpain cleavage, additional experiments were conducted using maitotoxin to stimulate calpain in quiescent MDCK cells (Fig. 2). Maitotoxin is a marine toxin that opens L-type calcium channels and specifically activates calpain but not caspase (39Zhao X. Pike B.R. Newcomb J.K. Wang K.K. Posmantur R.M. Hayes R.L. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It thus stimulates the generation of the characteristic 150-kDa αII spectrin breakdown product (αII-bdp1) (40Dutta S. Chiu Y.C. Probert A.W. Wang K.K. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As with the extraction assays in Fig. 1, incubation of MDCK cells with vanadate before maitotoxin exposure protected αII spectrin from calpain cleavage (Fig. 2). This effect directly correlated with the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation as measured by pTyr antibody. The in vivo pTyr state of αII spectrin is thus inversely proportional to its susceptibility to calpain cleavage. Surprisingly, protection was not absolute since after incubations exceeding 30 min, even in vanadate-treated cells, the level of calpain-cleaved αII spectrin rose to control levels (Fig. 2). We do not know the genesis of this biphasic effect but note that prolonged exposure to maitotoxin is toxic to cells and, thus presumably at longer times, creates a state no longer representative of the in vivo environment. Finally, it is interesting to note that when there is immediate harvest of untreated confluent MDCK cells into a SDS buffer, with care taken to block postextraction proteolysis by the early and liberal use of effective protease inhibitors, one achieves cell lysates that are nearly devoid of spontaneous αII spectrin breakdown product (Fig. 2, time zero). These results are in contrast to observations made following alternative lysis procedures, such as preincubation in RIPA buffer (Fig. 1 A), and suggests that the presence of αII spectrin bdp-1 in quiescent cultured cells as detected by ourselves (Fig. 1 A) and by others (14Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3527-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) probably represents an in vitro (rather than in vivo) proteolytic event that must occur rapidly following cell lysis. The SH3 domain of αII spectrin flanks the site of calpain cleavage and thus is an attractive candidate for the docking of kinases or phosphatases involved in the control of αII spectrin cleavage by calpain. An earlier report has documented by yeast two-hybrid assay that isoform A of low-molecular-weight phosphotyrosine phosphatase binds to this site (14Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3527-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have searched for direct binding partners in MDCK lysates by GST pull-down assays with recombinant GST-spectrin peptides containing only the SH3 domain of either αI or αII spectrin (Fig. 3). Although the SH3 domains of αI and αII spectrin share 75% homology, only the SH3 domain of αII spectrin bound c-Src in the MDCK cell lysates. Moreover, c-Src only bound when it was derived from vanadate-treated cells, a condition that leads to its autophosphorylation. Although these studies do not exclude the possibility of an unrecognized intervening adapter protein, it seems likely that the tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Src itself also determines its affinity for the SH3 domain of αII spectrin. Similar requirements for the binding of c-Src have also been noted in other settings (for review, see Ref. 41Bjorge J.D. Jakymiw A. Fujita D.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5620-5635Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The kinase c-Src thus makes an interesting complement to the phosphotyrosine phosphatase that also binds to this SH3 domain in αII spectrin (14Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H. Dhermy D. Grandchamp B. Lecomte M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3527-3536Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Observations in MDCK cells indicated that αII spectrin could be tyrosine-phosphorylated and that this event correlated with reduced αII spectrin proteolysis by endogenous μ-calpain. While other mechanisms are certainly possible, the simplest explanation of this linkage would be if Tyr1176 is the target of phosphorylation, a modification that would render it a less attractive substrate for μ-calpain (42Takahashi K. Mellgren R. Murachi T. Intracellular Calcium-dependent Proteolysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990: 55-74Google Scholar). In earlier work we have demonstrated that the critical Tyr1176-Gly1177 bond targeted by μ-calpain probably occurs in a highly exposed loop juxtaposed between helix C and the calmodulin-binding domain within the 11th repeat unit of αII spectrin, making it likely that subtle conformational features of this region exert significant effects on its suitability as a calpain target (43Stabach P.R. Cianci C.D. Glantz S.B. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This region of αII spectrin targeted by calpain is also interesting in that adjacent to the calpain cleavage site and the calmodulin-binding domain is a 20-residue sequence (insert 1) encoded by alternative exon usage (44McMahon A.P. Giebelhaus D.H. Champion J.E. Bailes J.A. Lacey S. Carritt B. Henchman S.K. Moon R.T. Differentiation. 1987; 34: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 45Cianci C.D. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochem. 1999; 38: 15721-15730Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Upstream of this insert is the spectrin SH3 domain, a motif common to many kinase and phosphatase signal transduction cascades (46Buday L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and as shown above, a site that binds c-Src. We therefore focused on this region of αII spectrin. A recombinant GST fusion peptide (SACC) encompassing αII spectrin repeats 9–12 was prepared (Fig.4 A). In silicoanalysis by NetPhos 2.0 (47Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) predicted that of the eight tyrosine residues in this peptide, only two were high-probability substrates for tyrosine phosphorylation. One was indeed Tyr1176, the other was Tyr1073 (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, Tyr1073 is the first residue after insert 1, and its phosphorylation potential is enhanced by sequences in insert 1 (Fig.4 B). When the purified recombinant GST-SACC peptide was incubated in vitro with the tyrosine kinase c-Src and γ-[32P]ATP, it became strongly labeled in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). Parallel studies using c-Src alone or a GST control peptide incorporated minimal phosphate, confirming that the SACC peptide was a favorable substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation. To identify the specific sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in SACC, a set of smaller recombinant peptides were examined that individually represented each of the structural and functional motifs in SACC (Fig.5 A). These peptides were incubated in vitro with c-Src, and pTyr was measured by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 5 B). Both the SA and S+ peptides (representing αII spectrin repeats 9 and 10, ± insert 1) were readily phosphorylated. Both of these peptides contained Tyr1073. Conversely, peptide S was not phosphorylated; it encompassed most of spectrin repeats 9 and 10 and included five tyrosine residues and the SH3 domain but lacked Tyr1073. Since Tyr1073 is the only tyrosine present in peptides SA and S+ that is not present in peptide S, we conclude that Tyr1073 is one target of spectrin tyrosine phosphorylation in vitro. Surprisingly, despite the impact of insert 1 on the calculated phosphorylation potential of Tyr1073, we found that its presence or absence had little effect on phosphorylation of Tyr1073 in these assays (cf. Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and3). Alternative phosphorylation conditions or kinases that might reveal the predicted impact of insert 1 were not explored in the present study. Examination of the recombinant peptides CC and C (encompassing the calpain cleavage site and calmodulin-binding domain in repeat 11 of αII spectrin) revealed a second site of tyrosine phosphorylation. These peptides differ only in the presence of the calpain cleavage domain (Fig. 5 A) with its single tyrosine, Tyr1176, at the calpain cleavage site. Peptide CC, but not C, was readily tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3 C), revealing this critical tyrosine as a second favored site of phosphorylation. After tyrosine phosphorylation of the recombinant peptides SACC and CC, both containing residue Tyr1176, their susceptibility toin vitro proteolysis by increasing amounts of μ-calpain was assayed by SDS-PAGE (Fig.6 A). These results were quantified by densitometry of the stained gels (Fig. 6 B). For both peptides, at every level of calpain, phosphorylation reduced the fraction of peptide proteolysed. At maximum concentrations of μ-calpain, tyrosine phosphorylation of SACC or CC afforded a 30–40% reduction in the extent of cleavage by μ-calpain. Conversely, a spectrin peptide representing the calmodulin-binding domain, but lacking the calpain-sensitive Tyr1076 site, was not cleaved by calpain (Fig. 6 A, panel C). These results cannot be due to the presence of c-Src itself in the reaction mixture since this kinase (without ATP) was included in all controls. It is also worth noting that the significant reductions in calpain sensitivity observed here probably underestimate the degree of resistance conferred by tyrosine phosphorylation since it is unlikely that stoichiometric phosphorylation of Tyr1176 was achieved. The studies presented here establish that αII spectrin i) is tyrosine-phosphorylated in cultured MDCK cells and that the level of this phosphorylation is increased by treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate; ii) that the in vivosusceptibility of endogenous αII spectrin to cleavage at Tyr1176 by μ-calpain is inversely proportional to its level of tyrosine phosphorylation; iii) that phosphorylated c-Src binds to the SH3 domain of αII spectrin; iv) that the targets of in vitro phosphorylation with c-Src kinase are residues Tyr1073 and Tyr1176 in αII spectrin; and v) that phosphorylation of Tyr1176 retards the susceptibility of this site to cleavage by μ-calpain in vitro. Collectively, these results establish the presence of at least two sites of tyrosine phosphorylation in αII spectrin and identify a novel regulatory mechanism acting through c-Src on the μ-calpain-mediated processing pathway of spectrin. Given the growing recognition of the importance of the cytoskeleton in determining cellular function, both in organelles and at the plasma membrane, these findings have implications for our understanding of membrane skeletal control in several settings and indicate that spectrin may be a key point of signal convergence between tyrosine kinase/phosphatase and Ca2+-mediated signal cascades. Calpain cleavage of proteins is important in many cellular and pathologic processes such as long-term potentiation and synaptic remodeling, glutamate-induced neurotoxicity, ischemic cellular injury, apoptosis, platelet activation, exocrine secretion, neutrophil activation, mitosis, progesterone and estrogen receptor modulation, and the regulation of a variety of kinases such as protein kinase C, phosphorylase kinase, myosin light chain kinase, calmodulin-dependent kinase and phosphatase, and other signal transduction pathways (for reviews, see Refs. 33Glantz S.B.

As cytoskeletal proteins are common substrates for calcium-dependent proteases, regulating the degree of calpain cleavage through tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate represents an important mechanism for modulating these cellular and pathologic events. While it is likely that the novel pathway for the control of spectrin breakdown reported here will be utilized in a variety of physiologic and pathologic settings, its role in neuronal function may be particularly important. Spectrin and other cytoskeletal-associated proteins interact with the glutamate-gatedN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor) (for review, see Ref. 52O'Brien R.J. Lau L.F. Huganir R.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors, a class of glutamate-gated cation channels with high Ca2+ conductance, mediate fast transmission and plasticity of central nervous system excitatory synapses. Spectrin associates with the NR2 cytosolic subunit of the NMDA receptor (19Wechsler A. Teichberg V.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3931-3939Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), an activity regulated by phosphorylation of the NR2 subunit. Calpain proteolysis of NR2 disrupts its association with spectrin, conversely its phosphorylation by c-Src protects it from calpain cleavage (36Bi R. Rong Y. Bernard A. Khrestchatisky M. Baudry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26477-26483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our present results suggest a related pathway by which tyrosine phosphorylation of αII spectrin might further protect the integrity of the NMDA receptor complex by retarding proteolysis of the spectrin membrane skeleton. While only a single study has explored the impact of phosphatase inhibitors on glutamate receptor and spectrin stability (38Bi R. Bi X. Baudry M. Brain Res. 1998; 797: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and found no protection of spectrin breakdown, our present results suggest that this issue deserves a more complete exploration. Regardless, the results reported here establish a novel post-translational modification in αII spectrin (tyrosine phosphorylation) and demonstrate a clear coupling between this modification and is susceptibility to calpain-mediated proteolysis, both in vivo and in vitro. We thank Mr. Paul Stabach for assistance with early aspects of this study and Dr. Susan Glantz for advice on the use of the cleavage-specific anti-spectrin antibodies and maitotoxin treatment of cell cultures."
https://openalex.org/W2323034715,"Whilst many studies have examined the role of the MAP Kinases in regulating the G1→S transition, much less is known about the function of these pathways in regulating other cell cycle transitions. Stimulation of the conditional mutant ΔMEKK3:ER* in asynchronous hamster (CCl39) and rat (Rat-1) fibroblasts resulted in the strong activation of endogenous JNK and p38 but only a weak activation of ERK. Activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* inhibited cell proliferation through a combination of an initial G1 and G2 cell cycle arrest, followed by a delayed onset of apoptosis. When cells were synchronized in S phase with aphidicolin and then released, activation of ΔMEKK3:ER* resulted in the up-regulation of p21CIP1 and a pronounced inhibition of cyclin A/CDK2 and cyclin B1/CDK1 kinase activity. Analysis of mitotic figures indicated that cells failed to enter mitosis, arresting late in G2. ΔMEKK3:ER*-mediated CDK inhibition and G2 arrest did not absolutely require p21CIP1, since both events were observed in Rat-1 cells in which p21CIP1 is transcriptionally silenced due to promoter methylation. Rather, CDK inhibition was associated with a down-regulation of cyclin A and B1 expression. Finally, application of the p38 inhibitor SB203580 partially restored cyclin B associated kinase activity and allowed cells to proceed through mitosis into the next G1 phase, suggesting that activation of the p38α/β2 pathway can promote a G2 cell cycle arrest."

In one of its longest isoforms, vertebrate-striated muscle titin contains more than 38,000 residues organized in 363 exons (2Bang M.L. Centner T. Fornoff F. Geach A.J. Gotthardt M. McNabb M.

Titin spans across one-half of a sarcomere in striated and cardiac muscle cells. Its N terminus is located within the Z-disc defining the border between adjacent sarcomeres, whereas its C terminus is located in the M-line at the center of the sarcomere. Titin acts as a molecular ruler within the sarcomeric units by providing many spatially defined binding sites for other sarcomeric proteins over the distance of an entire half-sarcomere (3Sanger J.W. Sanger J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Z-disk has a thickness between 40 and 100 nm depending on muscle type as revealed by electron microscopy (4Luther P.K. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It functions as a terminal anchor for a number of sarcomere filament systems like titin, actin, and nebulin. These filaments are cross-linked by a complex network of protein components, including α-actinin and several small proteins that mostly have been located in the Z-disk by immunofluorescence microscopy (5Faulkner G.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 12Mues A. van der Ven P.F. Young P. Furst D.O. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Telethonin is a small protein composed of 167 residues with unknown fold (13Valle G. Faulkner G., De Antoni A. Pacchioni B. Pallavicini A. Pandolfo D. Tiso N. Toppo S. Trevisan S. Lanfranchi G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It bears a specific phosphorylation site at its C terminus, which is a substrate for the muscle serine kinase of titin (14Mayans O. van der Ven P.F. Wilm M. Mues A. Young P. Furst D.O. Wilmanns M. Gautel M. Nature. 1998; 395: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The physiological function of telethonin is, however, still unclear. Besides a possible role in myofibril assembly, a more dynamic role in myofibril turnover is emerging (15Mason P. Bayol S. Loughna P.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Schroder R. Reimann J. Iakovenko A. Mues A. Bonnemann C.G. Matten J. Gautel M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Telethonin thus seems to play a role in developmental and functional regulation. Truncation analysis revealed that the N terminus of telethonin is sufficient for binding to the N terminus of titin (11Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunke K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Having identified telethonin as a specific ligand of the N terminus of titin it becomes a key marker for positioning the N terminus of titin in the Z-disk. There is also increasing evidence that mutations both in the binding segments of the N terminus of titin and telethonin lead to severe pathological disorders like limb-girdle muscle dystrophy and cardiomyopathy (17Itoh-Satoh M. Hayashi T. Nishi H. Koga Y. Arimura T. Koyanagi T. Takahashi M. Hohda S. Ueda K. Nouchi T. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Imaizumi T. Yasunami M. Kimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Jenne D.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The late onset of both pathologies is also in agreement with a role in later stages of muscle development. To provide molecular insight into this protein-protein interaction, Z1Z2-telethonin complexes with two different telethonin constructs were prepared. The first construct is the truncated telethonin segment minimally required for binding to titin (11Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunke K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), whereas the second one has the full-length telethonin sequence. The structure and stoichiometry of Z1Z2 and of the two complexes in the solution were studied by small angle scattering. This method reveals the low resolution structure of biological macromolecules in nearly native conditions (19Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar) and was, in particular, successfully employed to study muscle proteins in solution (20Krueger J.K. Bishop N.A. Blumenthal D.K. Zhi G. Beckingham K.

In the present study, synchrotron small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) data were collected and analyzed using recently developed ab initio methods (22Svergun D.I. Biophys.

All plasmids were constructed inEscherichia coli Strain DH5α. DNA manipulations andE. coli transformations were carried out using standard methods (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). The sequences of all cloned PCR products and mutants were confirmed by sequencing (SEQLAB, Göttingen, Germany).E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the expression host. The expression vectors pET6d and pET24d were obtained from Novagen. pETM6d and pETM11 were modified from pET6d and pET24d, respectively, by introducing a tobacco etch virus proteinase cleavage site between the His tag and cloned gene. IG domains from the titin N terminus were cloned into a modified pLexA vector described previously (10Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and interactions with full-length telethonin in pGAD10 (clone 633 from a screen with Z1Z2, Ref. 12Mues A. van der Ven P.F. Young P. Furst D.O. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) were monitored in L40 cells (25Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar) as described (10Young P. Ferguson C. Banuelos S. Gautel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1614-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Domain nomenclature followed the human cardiac titin sequence (EMBL X90568, Ref. 1Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Construct boundaries were as follows: Z1, residues 1–102; Z1Z2, residues 1–194; Z2, residues 104–194; Z1-X, residues 1–112; and X-Z2, residues 90–194. Telethonin truncations were designed based on structure analysis, generated by PCR, and subcloned into pGAD10. Truncation constructs of telethonin comprised the following residues: deltaC1 105–167, deltaC2 86–167, deltaN1 1–105, deltaN2 1–137, and delta N3 1–90. Their interaction with titin was analyzed by co-transformation with pLexA-Z1Z2 into L40 cells as described (12Mues A. van der Ven P.F. Young P. Furst D.O. Gautel M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the point mutations into telethonin (C18S, C47S, and C127S) using mutagenic oligonucleotides of 30–35 bases in length (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Cys-8 and Cys-15, which are close to the N terminus of telethonin, were mutated into serines using standard PCR (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). A 49er primer (5′-ATCCATGGCTACCTCAGAGCTGAGCAGCAGCGAGGTGTCGGAGGAGAAC-3′) including two point mutations and the N-terminal cloning site (NcoI) and the C-terminal cloning primer (5′-AAAGGTACCTTAGCCTCTCTGTGCTTCCTGG-3′) were designed for the point mutation of Cys-8 and Cys-15. The PCR fragment was restricted by NcoI and KpnI and cloned into the expression vectors pETM11. All bacterial transformants with recombinant plasmids were grown in LB medium with appropriate concentrations of antibiotics. A construct covering the Z1Z2 N-terminal domains of titin (residues 1–200) was cloned into pET6d and pETM6d vectors. In pET6d, Z1Z2 directly was fused with a His6 tag. In pETM6d, there was a TEV proteinase cleavage site between the His tag and Z1Z2. Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to the LB medium when Z1Z2 was expressed on either vector. The full-length (residues 1–167) and an N-terminal truncation (residues 1–90) of telethonin were cloned onto the pETM11 vector, leading to constructs pETM-C167 and pETM-C90, respectively. They contained a kanamycin resistance gene and were expressed in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. All constructs encoding telethonin contained a kanamycin resistance gene and were expressed in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The overnight cultures were grown in LB medium at 37 °C, diluted 50-fold, and grown to an A 600 nm of 0.6. The cells were harvested 4 h after induction with 1 mm IPTG. All proteins were purified using sequential chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), MonoQ, and Sepharose 75 gel filtration columns. Z1Z2 was isolated from the soluble fraction. Harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mmNaCl) supplemented with 1 mg/mg Lysozyme and 0.01 mg/ml DNase I, and were lysed by pulsed sonication (6 min, 30% power, large probe, Fisher Scientific model 550). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for one hour. The supernatants were applied to Ni2+-NTA (Qiagen) and equilibrated with lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 400 mmimidazole in lysis buffer. The eluted fraction was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The dialysate was applied to a MonoQ ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, HR 16/10) previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Heterologously expressed telethonin was only found in inclusion bodies. After lysis and centrifugation, the pellets were dissolved in denaturing buffer (8 m urea in 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0). The solutions were applied to a Ni-NTA column and equilibrated with the denaturing buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 400 mm imidazole in denaturing buffer. Z1Z2-telethonin complexes were formed by adding purified Z1Z2 into telethonin solutions diluting the solution to 4 m urea concentration. The protein mixture containing the Z1Z2-telethonine complex was dialyzed against 6 liters of 0.5 m NaCl in 25 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, for 2–4 h, then against 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, overnight. The dialysates were applied to a MonoQ ion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences, HR 16/10) previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The proteins were released in the same buffer with a gradient of 1–0.5m NaCl/80 ml at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The His tag was cleaved after the Ni2+-NTA column or MonoQ chromatography, by adding 1/50 tobacco etch virus proteinase and 2 mmdithiothreitol into the reaction mixture. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for two hours. Gel filtration was carried out on a Superose 75 HR10/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. After gel filtration, the protein samples in buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) were concentrated to the required value and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, Microcentrifuge), and the supernatants were used for x-ray solution scattering. Phosphorylation of telethonin and telethonin complexes was carried out essentially as described (14Mayans O. van der Ven P.F. Wilm M. Mues A. Young P. Furst D.O. Wilmanns M. Gautel M. Nature. 1998; 395: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) using the constitutively active titin kinase mutant Y170E. Phosphorylation reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by gel autoradiography and phosphorimaging. Mass-spectrometric analysis was used to analyze phosphorylation stoichiometry and sites. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements were performed on a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl. The sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at the and protein concentrations of: 40,000 rpm and 0.86 mg/ml for the full-length telethonin-titin complex (TE (167)-Z1Z2), 42,000 rpm and 0.83 mg/ml for the truncated telethonin-titin complex (TE (90)-Z1Z2), and 45,000 rpm and 1.3 mg/ml for the N terminus of titin, with and without polyhistidine tag (Z1Z2, His-Z1Z2). Scans were taken every 6 min at 280 nm. The sedimentation equilibrium measurements were performed at three protein concentrations between 0.36 and 0.90 mg/ml and at four speeds between 16,000 and 29,000 rpm for each sample. Scans were taken after 10 and 12 h of spinning at every speed at 280 nm. The data were analyzed using DCDT+ (version 1.12) (26Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) for sedimentation velocity and Ultrascan (version 5.0) for sedimentation equilibrium measurements, respectively. Ultrascan was a kind gift of Dr. Borries Demeler (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas). Partial specific volumes of 0.7316 ml/g (Z1Z2), 0.7297 ml/g (His-Z1Z2), 0.7287 ml/g (TE (90)-Z1Z2), and 0.7282 ml/g (TE (167)-Z1Z2) and a solvent density of 1.0266 g/ml were used. The sedimentation velocity experiments indicated that all four protein samples were homogenous and the data were fitted to a model for a single species. The values for the sedimentation (S 20,w) and the diffusion coefficient (D 20,w) (27Ralston G. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA1993: 14.2-14.4Google Scholar) were obtained to yield the MM estimates. The sedimentation equilibrium data were used for direct determination of the MM of the different protein samples. The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data were collected on the X33 camera (28Koch M.H.J. Bordas J. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1983; 208: 461-469Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar,29Boulin C.J. Kempf R. Gabriel A. Koch M.H.J. Nucl. Instrum. Meth. A. 1988; 269: 312-320Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) of the EMBL on the storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY) using multiwire proportional chambers with delay line readout (30Gabriel A. Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Meth. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The scattering patterns from Z1Z2 and His-Z1Z2 at protein concentrations between 3 and 80 mg/ml were recorded at sample-detector distances of 0.7, 1.4, and 3.4 m covering the range of momentum transfer 0.12 < s < 11.0 nm−1 (s = 4π sin(θ)/λ where 2θ is the scattering angle and λ = 0.15 nm is the x-ray wavelength). For the telethonin-Z1Z2 complexes, samples with concentrations between 3 and 20 mg/ml were measured at sample-detector distances of 1.4, 1.8, and 2.4 m covering the range 0.14 nm−1<s < 5.5 nm−1. The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam, corrected for the detector response, the scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for protein concentration. All procedures involved statistical error propagation using the program SAPOKO. 2M. H. J. Koch and D. I. Svergun, unpublished data. The low angle data measured at lower (<10 mg/ml) protein concentrations were extrapolated to infinite dilution following standard procedures (19Feigin L.A. Svergun D.I. Structure Analysis by Small-angle X-ray and Neutron Scattering. Plenum Press, New York1987Crossref Google Scholar) and merged with the higher angle data to yield the final composite scattering curves. The maximum dimensions of the particles D maxwere estimated using the orthogonal expansion program ORTOGNOM (31Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 258-267Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The forward scattering I (0) and the radii of gyrationRg were evaluated using the Guinier approximation (32Guinier A. Ann. Phys. (Paris). 1939; 12: 161-237Google Scholar) assuming that at very small angles (s < 1.3/Rg) the intensity is represented by I(s) = I (0) exp(−(sRg)2/3). These parameters were also computed from the entire scattering patterns using the indirect transform package GNOM (33Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2984) Google Scholar), which also provides the distance distribution functions of the particles p(r). The MM of the solutes were calculated by comparison with the forward scattering from reference solutions of bovine serum albumin (MM = 66 kDa). Low resolution models of the N terminus of Z1Z2 and of telethonin-Z1Z2 complexes were built using two ab initio methods. The program DAMMIN (22Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar) represents the protein shape as an ensemble of M≫1 densely packed beads inside a search volume (a sphere of diameter D max). Each bead belongs either to the protein (index = 1) or to the solvent (index = 0), and the shape is thus described by a binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, simulated annealing (34Kirkpatrick S. Gelatt C.D., Jr. Vecci M.P. Science. 1983; 220: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (31613) Google Scholar) is employed to find a compact configuration of beads minimizing the discrepancy χ between the experimental Iexp(s) and the calculated Icalc(s)curves as in Equation 1,χ2=1N−1∑jIexp(sj)−cIcalc(sj)ς(sj)2Equation 1 where N is the number of experimental points,c is a scaling factor, and ς(sj) is the experimental error at the momentum transfersj. The x-ray scattering curves at higher angles (starting approximately from s = 2.5 nm−1) contain significant contribution from the internal particle structure, which must be removed prior to the shape analysis. For this, a constant given by the slope of an s4I(s) versuss4 plot, is subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity would decay as s−4 following Porod's law (35Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar) for homogeneous particles. The resulting “shape scattering” curve (i.e. scattering due to the excluded volume of the particle with unit density) in the range up tos = 3.2 nm−1 was used for ab initio shape restoration. The excluded volume of the hydrated particle (Porod volume) was computed from the shape scattering curve using the following Equation 2 (35Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar).V=2π2I(0)/∫0∞s2I(s)dsEquation 2 The outer parts of the scattering patterns (s>3.5 nm−1) dominated by the scattering from the internal structure were discarded in the shape analysis. In a more versatile approach implemented in the program GASBOR (23Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), the protein is represented as a collection of dummy residues (DR). Starting from randomly positioned residues, a chain-compatible spatial distribution of DRs inside the search volume is found by simulated annealing. The DR method permits fitting data up to 0.5 nm resolution, but the number of residues must be known a priori. In all cases, one or two dozen DAMMIN and GASBOR reconstructions were performed for each of the proteins, and the independent models were averaged to yield the most probable low resolution model of the protein. For this, all possible pairs of models were aligned using the program SUBCOMB (36Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar), and the model giving the smallest average discrepancy with the rest was taken as a reference. All other models were aligned with the reference model of a density map of beads, or DRs was computed and cut at a threshold corresponding to the excluded particle volume. The scattering from the homology model of Z1Z2 (37Fraternali F. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was calculated using the program CRYSOL (38Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2789) Google Scholar), which takes the scattering from the excluded volume and from the hydration shell into account. Given the atomic coordinates, the program fits the experimental scattering curve by adjusting the excluded volume of the particle and the contrast of the hydration layer surrounding the particle in solution to minimize discrepancy (1Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar) between the calculated and the experimental intensities. The interaction of titin and full-length telethonin was monitored by assaying for HIS3-positive phenotype and β-galactosidase activity. Activation of both reporter genes was scored as interaction. Only the construct Z1Z2 was found to interact with telethonin, whereas the two individual IG domains Z1 and Z2 did not interact (data not shown). Both single domains Z1 and Z2 were extended at their C and N termini by 10–12 residues, respectively, to test the contribution of the linking region between the two IG domains. They behaved as the short single domain constructs in showing no interaction detectable by the two-hybrid system. This suggests that the linking region between Z1Z2 does not contribute significantly to titin/telethonin interaction, or that such an interaction may depend on secondary structure, or is localized on a non-linear epitope. Truncation constructs of telethonin were used to obtain a finer mapping of the titin-binding region by using the constructs ΔC1, ΔC2 (both containing the low-complexity, serine-rich C-terminal region), and ΔN1, ΔN2, and ΔN3 (Fig. 1). Growth on His plates and β-galactosidase activation was observed for ΔN1 to ΔN3 but not for the C-terminal fragments ΔC1 and ΔC2. We concluded from these observations that the first 90 residues of telethonin are sufficient for titin binding, in qualitative agreement with previous data showing that deletion of residues 4–78 abolished titin binding (11Gregorio C.C. Trombitas K. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Stier G. Kunke K. Suzuki K. Obermayr F. Herrmann B. Granzier H. Sorimachi H. Labeit S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The gene product fragments of titin used in this study (Fig. 2) were expressed and initially purified separately. The separate Z1Z2 and His-Z1Z2 constructs were highly homogeneous as evidenced by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3) and could be concentrated to about 100 mg/ml. These two constructs yielded an apparent MM around 30 kDa on a native electrophoresis gel. This value exceeds the calculated MM by about 50%, suggesting a non-globular shape of the two Z1Z2 constructs. The expression of the full-length telethonin TE (167) was only observed in inclusion bodies, whereas the truncated telethonin TE (90) was partially detected in the soluble fraction. Both telethonin constructs showed a strong tendency for aggregation and TE (167) was rapidly degraded so that these constructs were not further purified in isolated form. The monodisperse in vitro complexes appeared as single bands in a native electrophoresis gel and could be concentrated to about 40 mg/ml. The apparent MM were 50–55 kDa and 55–60 kDa for TE (90)-Z1Z2 and TE (167)-Z1Z2, respectively (Fig"

ATPase activity has long been recognized to be a capability limited to proteins. However, the presence of an astonishing variety of unknown RNA species in cells and the finding that RNA has catalytic activity have bred the notion that RNA might not be excluded from the group of ATPases. All DNA-packaging motors of double-stranded DNA phages involve two nonstructural components with certain characteristics typical of ATPases. In bacterial virus phi29, one of these two components is an RNA (pRNA). Here we report that this pRNA is able to bind ATP. A comparison between the chemically selected ATP-binding RNA aptamer and the central region of pRNA reveals similarity in sequence and structure. The replacement of the central region of pRNA with the sequence from ATP-binding RNA aptamer produced chimeric aptRNA that is able to both bind ATP and assemble infectious viruses in the presence of ATP. RNA mutation studies revealed that changing only one base essential for ATP binding caused both ATP binding and viral assembly to cease, suggesting that the ATP binding motif is the vital part of the pRNA that forms a hexamer to drive the phi29 DNA-packaging motor.

Careful scrutiny of the well studied dsDNA viruses reveals a striking commonality: all DNA-packaging motors involve two nonstructural components with certain characteristics typical of ATPases (8Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For example, gpA and gpNuI of the DNA-packaging motors of λ-phage (9Parris W. Davidson A. Keeler Jr., C.L. Gold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8413-8419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Hang J.Q. Tack B.F. Feiss M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 777-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) contain consensus ATP-binding domains and are involved in ATP hydrolysis. Both gp16 and gp17, which constitute the terminase of bacteriophage T4, are involved in ATP hydrolysis (11Rao V.B. Black L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In bacterial virus phi29, one of the nonstructural components for DNA packaging is an RNA molecule called pRNA (Fig.1) (12Guo P. Erickson S. Anderson D. Science. 1987; 236: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). One ATP is used to package two base pairs of phage DNA of the phi29 (8Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and the T3 system (13Morita M. Tasaka M. Fujisawa H. Virology. 1993; 193: 748-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The phi29-encoded 120-base pRNA binds the connector and leaves the DNA-filled capsid after completing the DNA-packaging task (14Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 3864-3871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six pRNAs form a hexagonal complex to gear the DNA-translocating machinery (14Chen C. Guo P. J.

It stuffs the viral procapsid with DNA at an initial speed of 100 base pairs/second under the extra load. The crystal structure of one of the important motor components, the connector where the pRNA binds, has been solved (6Simpson A.A. Tao Y. Leiman P.G. Badasso M.O. He Y. Jardine P.J. Olson N.H.

Sousa N. Carrascosa J.L. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 663-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has been reported that pRNA enhances the ATPase activity of gp16 (21Grimes S. Anderson D. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 559-566Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Ibarra B. Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4264-4273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It would be very intriguing to find out how the pRNA is involved in the transformation of chemical energy from ATP into motion and whether pRNA serves only as a stimulating factor or could interact with ATP directly. The presence of an astonishing variety of unknown RNA species in cells and the finding that RNA has enzymatic activity (23Cech T.R. Zaug A.J. Grabowski P.J. Cell. 1981; 27: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 24Guerrier-Takada C. Gardiner K. Marsh T. Pace N. Altman S. Cell. 1983; 35: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2066) Google Scholar) have bred the notion that RNA might not be excluded from the group of ATPases that has long been believed to be only proteins. One method for the examination of this idea is the chemical approach using the in vitro selection-amplification technique (25Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7739) Google Scholar, 54Tuerk G. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (8173) Google Scholar) to identify ATP-binding RNA dubbed aptamers (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) from synthesized random RNA pools. Here we report that the central region of pRNA is similar to the ATP-binding RNA aptamer (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) in sequence and structure. We also demonstrate that phi29 pRNA directly binds ATP. RNAs were prepared as described previously (27Zhang C.L. Lee C.-S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 201: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). DNA oligomers were synthesized with the desired sequences and used to produce dsDNA by PCR. The DNA products containing the T7 promoter were cloned into plasmids. RNA was synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase by run-off transcription and then purified from a polyacrylamide gel. The sequences of both plasmids and PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Virol. 1995; 69: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the morphogenetic factor (gp13) (29Lee C.S. Guo P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and the procedure for the assembly of infectious phi29 virion in vitro (29Lee C.S. Guo P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously. 1 μg of RNA in 1 μl RNase-free H2O was mixed with 10 μl of purified procapsids (0.4 mg/ml) and then dialyzed on a 0.025-μm-type VS filter membrane against TBE (2 mm EDTA, 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0) for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was subsequently transferred for another dialysis against TMS (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8) for an additional 30 min. The pRNA-enriched procapsids were then mixed with gp16, DNA-gp3, and ATP (1.4 mm final concentration except when otherwise indicated) to complete the DNA-packaging reaction. After 30 min, gp11, gp12, gp9, and gp13 were added to the DNA-packaging reactions to complete the assembly of infectious virions, which were assayed by standard plaque formation. Inhibition assays were performed with the highly sensitive in vitro phi29 assembly system described above with the exception that the final concentration of ATP was 0.25 mm. Reaction buffer containing 0.25 mm ATP in TMS was mixed with varied concentrations of ADP, AMP, and adenosine before being added to the in vitro phi29 assembly system and assayed for the formation of phi29 plaques. A column that was 0.55 cm in diameter was packed with affinity-agarose resin immobilized with 5 mm ATP (or higher concentration) and attached through the C-8 position to cyanogen bromide-activated agarose. Lyophilized resin was soaked in distilled water for >30 min before column packing. After washing with 10 ml of distilled water and then with 10 ml of binding buffer (300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5 mmMgCl2), 1 μg (2.5 × 10−5 μmol) of3H-labeled RNA in 100 μl binding buffer was applied to the ATP affinity column. The column was then washed with 3 ml of binding buffer and eluted with the same buffer containing ATP or other nucleotides as indicated. Fractions were collected and subjected to scintillation counting. A 116-base rRNA was used as a negative control. The Apparent K ds for RNA/ATP interaction were determined by two methods, isocratic elution (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 34Arnold F.H. Schofield S.A. Blanch H.W. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 355: 1-12Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ATP gradient elution. For isocratic elution, a column with a diameter of 0.55 cm was packed with 2.8 ml of ATP C-8-agarose containing 5 mm ATP. After washing the column with an excess amount of binding buffer, 2.5 × 10−5 μmol of [3H]pRNA or aptRNA in 100 μl of binding buffer was applied to the column. The RNAs were then eluted with the same binding buffer. For ATP gradient elution, a column 0.8 cm in diameter was packed with 0.8 ml ATP C-8-agarose immobilized with 5 mm ATP. 1 μg (2.5 × 10−5 μmol) of [3H]pRNA in 100-μl binding buffer was applied to the column. After washing with 5 ml of binding buffer, RNA was eluted with a 2-ml step-up gradient with increasing concentrations of ATP in the binding buffer. The purified DNA-packaging components, gp16 (0.24 μg), DNA-gp3 (0.1 μg), procapsid (3.2 μg), and RNA (1 μg), were mixed individually or in combination with 0.3 mm of unlabeled ATP and 0.75 μCi (6000 Ci/mmol) of [γ-32P]ATP in the reaction buffer (30Guo P. Grimes S. Anderson D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3505-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). When one or more components was omitted, the component(s) was replaced with the same volume of TMS. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, 3 μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate (J. T. Chemical Co.) (8Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and air-dried. The plate was then soaked in methanol for 5 min, air-dried, and then run in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 mlithium chloride. Autoradiograms were produced with Cyclone Storage PhosphorScreen (Packard Instrument Co.). At the same time, a parallel experiment was conducted with the same components to test the results of phi29 virion assembly. Only those assembly reactions with a yield higher than 5 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml were selected for ATPase assay. To investigate whether pRNA could interact with ATP directly, an ATP-agarose affinity column containing 5 mm ATP (or higher concentration) was used to detect the binding of pRNAwt, the shortest pRNA with wild type pRNA phenotype, to ATP (Fig.2 A, I). [3H]pRNAwt was applied to an ATP-affinity column and washed with a large volume of binding buffer. [3H]pRNAwt was eluted from the column when 0.04 mm ATP was added to the buffer, suggesting that pRNAwt binds ATP specifically. When the 116-base rRNA served as the negative control, no detectable RNA was eluted by as high as 5 mm ATP buffer, thereby indicating that the pRNA/ATP interaction was specific to pRNA. When the conserved base Gcon, essential for ATP-binding (Fig. 1), was changed to a C, the resulting mutant pRNAGconC could not bind ATP (TableI).Table IATP-binding and viral assembly activities of pRNA and mutantsRNAsMutationATP-bindingComponents addedATPRNaseγ-s-ATPVirus produced%pfu/ml−−−→0aptRNAChimera80−−+→0++−→0+−+→0+−−3 × 108pRNAwtwild type pRNA20+−−3 × 108aptGconCGcon→C→0+−−→0pRNAwtGconCGcon→C→0+−−→0116-base rRNA→0+−−→0 Open table in a new tab A chemically selected aptamer RNA has been found to be able to bind ATP (Fig. 1) (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The structural basis for this ATP-binding RNA aptamer has also been elucidated by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy (35Dieckmann T. Suzuki E. Nakamura G.K. Feigon J. RNA. 1996; 2: 628-640PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cech T.R. Szewczak A.A. RNA. 1996; 2: 625-627PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jiang F. Kumar R.A. Jones R.A. Patel D.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). All ATP-binding aptamers contain a consensus sequence embedded in a common secondary structure (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Dieckmann T. Suzuki E. Nakamura G.K. Feigon J. RNA. 1996; 2: 628-640PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cech T.R. Szewczak A.A.

The bases essential for ATP-binding have been identified previously (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 37Jiang F. Kumar R.A. Jones R.A. Patel D.J. Nature. 1996; 382: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The structure of the phi29 pRNA has been investigated extensively (for review see Ref.38Guo P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2002; 72: 415-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the structure of ATP-binding aptamers with phi29 pRNA and found that the aptamers are very similar to the central part of phi29 pRNA (Fig. 1). To further confirm that an ATP-binding motif is present in the pRNA molecule, the pRNA motif with a potential for ATP binding was replaced with a sequence from ATP-binding RNA aptamer, ATP-40-1 (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). When chimeric aptRNA was added to the phi29 in vitro assembling mixture (29Lee C.S. Guo P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5018-5023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Lee C.S. Guo P. Virology. 1994; 202: 1039-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), ∼108 infectious virus particles (plaque-forming unit) per milliliter were produced in the test tube (Table I) (Fig.3). The omission of ATP or aptRNA or the addition of RNase to the reaction mixture failed to generate a single virus (Table I). To establish that the activity of aptRNA is related to ATP, virus assembly using aptRNA was performed with and without ATP. When ATP was omitted from the reaction, not a single plaque was detected. Virus assembly was also inhibited by the poorly hydrolyzable ATP analogue γ-S-ATP, suggesting that the aptRNA-involved viral assembly process is ATP-related (Table I). Seven different affinity resins were tested for pRNAwt and aptRNA binding affinity to ATP. These resins vary in nucleotide composition and in location for nucleotide/agarose linkage. Our results show that both pRNAwt and aptRNA bound only to an agarose resin containing ATP in which no binding to the resin with ADP or adenosine-3′,5′-diphosphate was detected. For ATP resin, both pRNAwt and aptRNA bound only to agarose resins with the attachment site at the C-8 position but not at N-6 or the hydroxyl position. These results suggest that both pRNAwt and aptRNA/ATP interaction require a specific three-dimensional configuration and that such a requirement is similar for both RNAs. It has been reported that in the phi29 DNA-packaging system, ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP during packaging (8Guo P. Peterson C. Anderson D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 229-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to know whether pRNAwt and aptRNA can discriminate ATP from ADP. Both ATP (immobilized by ATP) and an ADP affinity-agarose column (immobilized by ADP) were attached through the C-8 position and used to compare relative binding affinity. It was found that both pRNAwt and aptRNA had a higher affinity for ATP than for ADP (Fig. 4). Further investigation revealed that aptRNA had a higher affinity than pRNAwt in ADP and AMP binding (Fig. 4). The binding affinity of aptRNA for ADP and AMP was very similar. The data partially agree with previous publications showing that the ATP-binding RNA aptamer binds ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine equally (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Dieckmann T. Suzuki E. Nakamura G.K. Feigon J. RNA. 1996; 2: 628-640PubMed Google Scholar, 40Nonin S. Jiang F. Patel D.J. J.

Biol. 1997; 273: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the binding affinity of aptRNA to ADP and AMP was lower than that for ATP (Fig. 4). This suggests that the γ-phosphate was involved in ATP binding in aptRNA but not in the ATP-binding RNA aptamer (Fig. 7). As noted earlier, pRNAwt had higher affinity for ATP than for AMP. However, it has been demonstrated previously that the ATP-binding RNA aptamer could bind ATP, AMP, and adenosine with similar affinity (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Dieckmann T. Suzuki E. Nakamura G.K. Feigon J. RNA. 1996; 2: 628-640PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jiang F. Kumar R.A. Jones R.A.

We showed that the binding affinity of aptRNA is higher for ATP than for ADP and AMP (Fig. 4). The result suggested that the structure of the RNA aptamer motif remains basically unchanged in the context of the chimeric aptRNA, whereas the global structures of aptRNA, pRNAwt, and apt-binding RNA aptamer for holding ATP and AMP are not identical. The 30 bases at the 5′ end and the 52 bases at the 3′ end obviously have certain physical obstructive effects on general RNA/nucleotide interaction, since the Apparent K d for ATPbound as determined by isocratic elution (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 34Arnold F.H. Schofield S.A. Blanch H.W. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 355: 1-12Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) is 14 μm for ATP-binding RNA aptamer (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) while it is 100 μm (see below) for aptRNA. Moreover, the bases at the 5′ end and 3′ end might help to promote the holding for the γ-phosphate, because both pRNAwt and aptRNA had a higher affinity for ATP than for ADP and AMP, whereas RNA aptamer bound ATP and AMP equally. To test whether the ATP-binding aptamer in aptRNA is truly functioning with an interchangeable ATP binding site and whether the ATP binding is related to DNA-packaging and phi29 assembly function, inhibition studies were conducted by adding ADP, AMP, and adenosine to the phi29 assembly system with pRNAwt and aptRNA. Because aptRNA contains an ATP-binding RNA aptamer that binds adenosine, AMP, and ATP with similar affinity, if ATP-binding is related to biological function, then aptRNA containing such an aptamer could be poisoned by the addition of adenosine or AMP, whereas the pRNAwt-packaging system should not be poisoned. The result from phi29 assembly assays revealed that AMP and adenosine inhibited aptRNA activity strongly while the inhibition effect for pRNAwt was not as strong (Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7).Figure 5Comparison of inhibitory effect of pRNAwt and aptRNA by ADP, AMP, and adenosine on phi29 assembly.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To compare the binding affinity for ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, pRNAwt (Fig. 2 C, I) or aptRNA (Fig.2 C, II) was first attached to the ATP-agarose gel. After washing with an excess amount of binding buffer, the bound RNA was then eluted by the buffers containing ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP. It was found that ATP buffer could elute the bound aptRNA or pRNAwt effectively while GTP, CTP, and UTP buffer was much less efficient. The Apparent K ds for RNA/ATP interaction were determined by isocratic elution (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 34Arnold F.H. Schofield S.A. Blanch H.W. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 355: 1-12Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and ATP gradient elution. The isocratic elution method was used to measure the Apparent K d for ATP that immobilized on agarose (ATPbound) while the purpose of the ATP gradient elution was to measure the Apparent K d for free ATP (ATPfree). With the isocratic elution method (Fig.8 A), ApparentK d was determined with the equation: ApparentK d = [L] × (V t −V 0)/(V e −V 0), where [L] is the concentration of ATP immobilized on agarose, V t is the volume of the column, V 0 is the void volume of the column, and V e is the volume needed to elute the RNA (Fig. 8). The Apparent K d for aptRNA and for pRNAwt interacting with the ATPbound was determined to be (0.1 ± 0.06) mm and (1.3 ± 0.8) mm, respectively. The K d for pRNAwt, which is more than ten times higher than that for aptRNA, indicated that the affinity of pRNAwt for ATP is much lower than that of aptRNA. Therefore, a resin immobilized with higher ATP concentration (⩾5 mm) was needed to detect the ATP/pRNA interaction through the ATP affinity-agarose method. If the ATP concentration is lower than 5 mm, it is difficult to detect the binding in the elution assay in Fig. 2. For ATP gradient elution, ATPfree will compete with the ATPbound for binding to aptRNA or pRNAwt. To completely elute the pRNAwt bound to the column, the concentration of ATPfree must be close to the Apparent K d. Otherwise, the ATPfreewould not be able to snatch the RNA that had been attached to the ATPbound in the column. From the ATP gradient elution (Fig.8 B), it was found that most of the bound aptRNA and pRNAwt was eluted by 0.004 and 0.04 mmATPfree, respectively. This suggests that the ApparentK ds for the complexes of aptRNA·ATPfree and pRNAwt·ATPfree are around 0.004 and 0.04 mm, respectively. The finding of a difference in ApparentK d determined through these two methods is not surprising, because the C-8 linkage of ATP to agarose might hamper the RNA/ATP interaction that involves a three-dimensional contact. Furthermore, it is possible that only a certain fraction of ATPbound in the gel is accessible to aptRNA or pRNAwt. Nucleotide Gcon (Fig. 1) has been shown to be highly conserved in ATP-binding RNA aptamers, and it is the most critical nucleotide for ATP binding (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 35Dieckmann T. Suzuki E. Nakamura G.K. Feigon J. RNA. 1996; 2: 628-640PubMed Google Scholar). One G corresponding to Gcon of the aptRNA is also conserved in all of the pRNAs of five different bacteriophages (43Bailey S. Wichitwechkarn J. Johnson D. Reilly B. Anderson D. Bodley J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22365-22370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Chen C. Zhang C. Guo P. RNA. 1999; 5: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The mutation of Gcon to C resulted in a mutant aptRNAGconC (Fig. 1) that was not able to bind ATP (Fig.2 A, II). This mutant was also completely inactive in virion assembly (Table I), suggesting that the functions of ATP binding and virion assembly are correlated. When the Gconmutation was introduced into the conserved Gcon of pRNAwt, the ATP-binding activity of the mutant pRNAGconC disappeared (Fig. 2 A, I). This mutant was found to be incompetent in phi29 assembly (Table I). By structural analysis, in addition to competition and inhibition with binomial distribution analysis (15Trottier M. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 487-494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Chen C. Trottier M. Guo P. Nucleic Acids Symp. Ser. 1997; 36: 190-193Google Scholar), it was confirmed that the incompetence of such mutant aptRNA with regard to driving the motor is because of a change in chemistry rather than structure (data not shown). The conformation change of pRNAwt was investigated in the presence and absence of ATP. ATP caused a change in the pRNAwt migration rate in native gels (Fig. 6 A). Purified pRNAwt was loaded onto a native gel with different concentrations of ATP. The pRNAwt was observed to migrate more slowly when ATP was present. The band with the slower migration rate was purified and shown to be fully active in DNA packaging. At the same time, the control Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA did not show any migration rate change attributed to the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 6 A). We have reported that magnesium induces a conformational change of pRNA (46Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Trottier M. Mat-Arip Y. Zhang C. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. RNA. 2000; 6 (1257–1266): 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is possible that the change of pRNA conformation was because of the depletion of ions by ATP. However, we have previously reported that pRNA formed oligomers with a slower migration rate in gel when magnesium is present (46Chen C. Guo P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 495-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Trottier M. Mat-Arip Y. Zhang C. Chen C. Sheng S. Shao Z. Guo P. RNA. 2000; 6 (1257–1266): 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The formation of a band with a slower migration rate in Fig. 6 A suggests that in the presence of ATP, the conformation or oligomerization of pRNA is larger rather than smaller. This phenomenon argues against the possibility that the conformational change is simply the result of the depletion of ions by ATP. If that were true, the RNA would become smaller and run faster in the presence of ATP. The appearance of a broad band representing pRNA with a slower migration rate also suggests that more than one conformation of pRNA may be present. Hydrolysis of [32P]ATP was assayed by thin layer chromatography on a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate. Components involved in DNA packaging were mixed alone or in combination with [32P]ATP. After an incubation period of 30 min, the reaction mixture was applied to the polyethyleneimine-plate. Results from thin layer chromatography revealed that the individual component alone exhibited almost undetectable ATPase activity (Fig. 6 B). However, ATP was hydrolyzed to inorganic phosphate in the reaction along with all DNA-packaging components including pRNA. Many RNA aptamers have been isolated and extensively investigated (25Ellington A.D. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7739) Google Scholar, 26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but these studies have remained very theoretical since none of these reported aptamers has been identified in RNA molecules in nature. This work demonstrated that the chemically selected ATP-binding RNA aptamer is similar to the central region of pRNA in sequence and structure. The replacement of the central region of pRNAwt with the sequence from the aptamer produced a chimeric aptRNA that was able to assemble infectious viruses in a test tube containing other purified phi29 structural components. RNA mutation studies revealed that the change of only one base essential for ATP binding caused the activities of ATP binding and viral assembly to cease, confirming that a structure similar to the ATP-binding RNA aptamer is present in bacterial virus phi29. There are several similarities and differences among pRNAwt, aptRNA, and the ATP-binding RNA aptamer. The similarities include the following. 1) All of them bind ATP. 2) All of them prefer the ATP-resin with a C-8 linkage. 3) All of them have a higher affinity for ATP than for GTP, CTP, and UTP. 4) Both pRNAwt and aptRNA have a higher affinity for ATP than for ADP. 5) All of them contain a conserved Gcon at a similar position. The differences include the following. 1) Both pRNAwt and aptRNA have a higher affinity for ATP than for ADP and AMP, whereas the RNA aptamer binds ATP, ADP, AMP, and adenosine equally (26Sassanfar M. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1993; 364: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). This is an indication that the 5′- and 3′-extended bases of the aptRNA provide a packet to hold the γ-phosphate of ATP. The preference for ATP over ADP is explainable. Because ATP-binding is related to biological activity, the pRNA must have the ability to trap ATP and to release ADP after ATP hydrolysis. 2) The ATP-binding affinity of aptRNA is higher than that of pRNAwt (Figs. 2 and 4). However, the specific activity of aptRNA in phi29 assembly is lower than that of pRNAwt (data not shown). Two possibilities might explain this discrepancy. First, the binding of pRNAwt to the connector is the rate-determining step in phi29 DNA packaging and assembly. The change of the mutant is at the connector-binding domain. This change might somehow alter its structure and thus hamper the connector binding affinity. Second, although the chemically selected ATP-binding aptamer is an excellent molecule for ATP binding, it might not be after all the best candidate in nature for ATP hydrolysis if such hydrolysis does occur. Too high a binding affinity to the substrate does not signify a good biological component or enzyme, because this component or enzyme will not be dissociated from its substrate easily. Such dissociation might be critical for the turnover in pRNAwt/ATP interaction in phi29 assembly. Here we found that the putative ATP-binding site in pRNAwtresides within a region interacting with the connector. The significance for such ATP/pRNAwt binding remains to be investigated. One possible implication is that ATP binding to pRNAwt provides a special structure in the assembly of the packaging machinery. Another possible implication is that alternative binding and release of ATP from pRNAwt could induce a conformational change of pRNAwt that in turn rotates the connector and pRNA is part of the ATPase complex.

https://openalex.org/W1989975406,"Coagulation factor IXa (fIXa) plays a central role in the coagulation cascade. Enzymatically, fIXa is characterized by its very low amidolytic activity that is not improved in the presence of cofactor, factor VIIIa (fVIIIa), distinguishing fIXa from all other coagulation factors. Activation of the fIXa-fVIIIa complex requires its macromolecular substrate, factor X (fX). The 99-loop positioned near the active site partly accounts for the poor activity of fIXa because it adopts a conformation that interferes with canonical substrate binding in S2-S4. Here we show that residues Lys-98 and Tyr-99 are critically linked to the amidolytic properties of fIXa. Exchange of Tyr-99 with smaller residues resulted not only in an overall decreased activity but also in impaired binding in S1. Replacement of Lys-98 with smaller and uncharged residues increased activity. Simultaneous mutagenesis of Lys-98, Tyr-177, and Tyr-94 produced an enzyme with 7000-fold increased activity and altered specificity. This triple mutant probably mimics the conformational changes that are physiologically induced by cofactor and substrate binding. It therefore provides a cooperative two-step activation model for fIXa. Tyr-177 locks the 99-loop in an inactive conformation which, in the physiologic complex, is released by cofactor fVIIIa. FX is then able to rearrange the unlocked 99-loop and subsequently binds to the active site cleft. Coagulation factor IXa (fIXa) plays a central role in the coagulation cascade.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Its activation requires cleavage of two peptide bonds by either the activated factor VII (fVIIa)-tissue factor complex or activated factor XI (fXIa) (3Fujikawa K. Legaz M.E. Kato H. Davie E.W.

The light chain comprises the N-terminal Gla domain with γ-carboxylated glutamic acid residues and two epidermal growth factor-like domains. The heavy chain forms the serine protease domain. Activated factor IX (fIXa)1 then activates fX in a reaction that is dependent on the presence of calcium ions, a membrane surface, and a nonenzymatic protein cofactor, activated factor VIII (fVIIIa) (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The importance of fIXa in hemostasis is reflected by the occurrence of the bleeding disorder hemophilia B in individuals carrying mutations in the fIX gene (5Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). fIXa displays only very little proteolytic activity against natural or synthetic substrates in the absence of its cofactor. Binding of fVIIIa results in a 106-fold increase in proteolytic activity for fX, whereas the activity with peptidic substrates remains unaltered (6Duffy E.J. Lollar P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 7196-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The latter dramatic substrate-dependent activity modulation distinguishes fIXa from the related coagulation enzymes fXa and fVIIa, which in the presence of their cofactors, achieve a significant activity enhancement with synthetic substrates (8Rosing J.

Chem. 1994; 270: 970-977Google Scholar). The unique behavior of fIXa is related to a set of surface-exposed structure elements. In particular, the conformation of the fIXa 99-loop deviates considerably from those observed in the related enzymes of the fIX gene family (10Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Chène C. Winkler F.K. Guha A.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) show that exchange of the 99-loop (chymotrypsinogen numbering used throughout within the serine protease domain) with the corresponding sequence of fXa results in a 22-fold increase in activity toward synthetic substrates. Kolkman and Mertens (16Kolkman J.A. Mertens K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7398-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) further demonstrate that the 99-loop restricts enzymatic activity toward fX and synthetic substrates in the absence, but not in the presence, of the cofactor fVIIIa. The side chain of Tyr-99 adopts different conformations in the two crystal structures of fIXa reported to date (11Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Hopfner K.P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In both structures Tyr-99 is in steric conflict with canonical substrate binding in the S2-S4 sites. These observations suggest a critical role of Tyr-99 and spatially neighboring amino acids for the substrate dependent activity of fIXa. In particular, Lys-98 is likely to electrostatically interfere with the basic substrate preference of fIXa. Important questions remain open, however, including (i) What are the distinguishing mechanisms of substrate-assisted activity enhancement of fIXa?, (ii) What are the mechanisms underlying the cofactor-assisted activity enhancement of fIXa?, and (iii) Are these mechanisms independent from each other or coupled on a molecular basis? To address these questions, we introduced a series of point mutations in the 99-loop of a truncated version of fIXa, designated rf9a, lacking the N-terminal Gla and epidermal growth factor-1 domains. In detail, residues Lys-98 and Tyr-99 were exchanged with smaller and/or uncharged residues. In addition, two solvent-exposed alanine residues from the 99-loop were deleted, and we constructed multiple mutants, where several interactions stabilizing the 99-loop were simultaneously abolished. We investigated the influence of the primary specificity pocket on activity by mutating the fIX-specific residues Glu-219 and Ser-190 positioned at the entrance and within the S1 site, respectively. N-Methylsulfonyl-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-4-nitroanilide acetate (MS-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA), methoxycarbonyl-d-Norleucyl-Gly-Arg-4-nitronilide acetate (MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA), and human antithrombin III were purchased from Roche Diagnostics GmbH (Mannheim, Germany), and Q-Sepharose ff and Heparin-Sepharose CL 6B were from AmershamBiosciences. para-Aminobenzamidine (PABA), porcine heparin (grade I-A), and crude Russell's viper snake venom (RVV) were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. The fX activator RVV-X was purified as described elsewhere (17Esmon C.T. Prothrombin Activation.Ph.D. thesis.

Purified human α-thrombin was a generous gift from Dr. Wirthensohn (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). Restriction enzymes and enzymes used for PCR and cloning were from Roche Diagnostics GmbH and New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany). All other materials were of the highest grade commercially available. Cloning and expression of proteins was done in the Escherichia coli K12 strain UT5600 (18Grodberg J. Dunn J.J. J.

All techniques used for amplification, mutagenesis, and cloning of DNA followed published protocols (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Activation was achieved using RVV-X, and the concentration of active sites was determined using thrombin-titrated antithrombin III and heparin as active site reactants (15Hopfner K.P. Brandstetter H.

Experiments were performed in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 8.0, at 25 °C in a temperature-controlled Kontron-Uvikon 933 spectrophotometer (Kontron Instruments, Milano, Italy). Substrate concentrations ranged from 30 μm to 5 mm. Enzyme concentrations were between 2 and 200 nm. Reactions were started by adding the enzyme to the pre-warmed reaction buffer containing different substrate concentrations. The change in absorption at 405 nm was monitored for typically 2 min, and ΔE/min was calculated from the linear part of the curve. Kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear curve-fitting of the initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the SigmaPlot software (Jandel GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Inhibition constants of PABA were measured by competition with MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA. A 7 × 6 matrix was created by varying the concentration of MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA (45 μm to 3 mm) and PABA (0–2 mm) by repeated dilution by a factor of 2 and 3, respectively. The highest concentration was usually 5–10-fold the K m of MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA or K i of PABA. Kinetic data were calculated by global nonlinear least square fitting of the reaction rate v to v =e T k cat[S]/(K m(1 + [I]/K i) + [S]), where e T, [S], and [I] denote the total concentration of enzyme, substrate, and the inhibitor PABA, respectively. The influence of ethylene glycol on the reactivity of the enzymes was examined by measuring their activity in the presence of different ethylene glycol concentrations and 1 mm substrate. The location of the mutations is summarized in Fig. 1. We examined enzymatic activity and conformational aspects of the mutants. The amidolytic activity and changes in selectivity in S2/S4 were probed by using the peptidic substrates MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA (substrate A) and MS-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA (substrate B). To measure the effects of the mutations on the conformation of the primary specificity pocket, we also determined the binding constant K i of the reversible S1 site inhibitor PABA in competition with substrate A. The results for the point mutations of Tyr-99 and Lys-98 as well as the Ala95a/Ala95b deletion mutant are summarized in TableII.Table IISpecificity constants (kcat /Km) for the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA (A) and MS-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA (B) and binding constants (Ki) for PABA for rf9a-99-loop single mutantsEnzymek catt/K mSelectivity, A/BKi PABAABs −1 M −1μMrf9a-wild type1341590.85201rf9a-Y99L55740.74230rf9a-Y99T33221.49690rf9a-Y99A790.72561rf9a-K98R1651201.37230rf9a-K98M3742361.58119rf9a-K98T9024332.08123rf9a-ΔA95a/A95b1451810.80345rf9a-ΔA95a/A95b denotes the two-residue deletion mutant where the fIXa-specific insertions Ala95a and Ala95b are removed.

As summarized in Fig. 1, structure analysis indicated that Tyr-99 hinders the direct substrate access to the S4 binding site (11Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 13Hopfner K.P. Lang A. Karcher A. Sichler K. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. Huber R. Bode W. Engh R.A. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 989-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, we replaced Tyr-99 with several smaller residues. These substitutions always resulted in a decreased activity, and the reductions inversely correlated with the size of the introduced residue; the activity of rf9a-Y99L with substrate A was reduced to 41%, whereas rf9a-Y99A retained only 5% of its original activity. Likewise, the affinity for the inhibitor PABA was decreased depending on the reduction of the side chain size. Despite these effects on activity and inhibitor binding, only the mutation Y99T had an influence on the selectivity of the enzyme as measured with two synthetic substrates. Fig. 1 also suggests that the positively charged side chain of Lys-98 might interfere with the access of basic residues to the S1 pocket (11Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9796-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore we set out to test the role of both size and charge of the residue at position 98. Replacement of Lys-98 with the larger but equally charged arginine had only a minor effect on the amidolytic activity. In contrast, rf9a-K98M resulted in a 2.8-fold, and rf9a-K98T resulted in a 6.7-fold increase in activity with substrate A. Although PABA binding was hardly affected in rf9a-K98R, it was improved in the other 98 mutants, leading to aK i reduced to ∼60% that of the original value (see Table II). In addition to the impact on activity and inhibitor binding, the mutations also influenced the selectivity for the two tested substrates. The stronger the activity increased, the more the preference was altered toward the substrate A, which was less preferred in the wild-type enzyme. Ala95a-Ala95b is a factor IXa-specific two-residue insertion as compared with trypsin-like serine proteases. This distinct sequential motif prompted us to probe the role of this insertion on rf9a amidolytic activity. Deletion of Ala95a/Ala95b, thus, aimed to reconstitute the 99-loop in a conformation resembling that of related coagulation factors. Nevertheless, this deletion had only little influence on all parameters examined. The conformation of the 99-loop in fIXa relates to a series of more subtle structural characteristics in addition to a two-residue insertion (Ala95a-Ala95b). Its conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Lys-98 and the hydroxyl of Tyr-94, which is specific to fIXa. Also, Tyr-177 and Lys-98 would collide if the fIXa-99-loop were to adopt an fXa-like conformation. Moreover, the structure analysis revealed that Tyr-177 stabilizes and locks the 99-loop in its inactive conformation by interactions with Asn-97 and Asn-100 (cf. Fig. 1). Given the impact of mutants in the 99-loop on the activity, in particular K98T, we constructed multiple mutants to mimic the cooperative mode of fIXa activation in the physiological context. The kinetic parameters (activity, selectivity, and inhibitor binding) for these enzymes together with the corresponding wild-type data are summarized in TableIII.Table IIISpecificity constants (kcat /Km) for the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrates MOC-d-Nle-Gly-Arg-pNA (A) and MS-d-Phe-Gly-Arg-pNA (B) and binding constants (Ki) for PABA for rf9a-99-loop multiple mutantsEnzymekcat/KmSelectivity, A/BKi PABAABs −1 M −1μMrf9a-wild type1341590.85201rf9a-Y94F/K98T/Y177T948,898490,5461.93226rf9a-99loop(F10)-Y94F/Y177T6,8104,2431.60129rf9a-99loop(F10)3-aRef. 15.1,9701,6401.20117rf10a-WT3-aRef. 15.983,000390,0002.5260rf10a-99loop(F9)3-aRef. 15.17,80010,2001.75360rf9a-99loop(F10) denotes the recombinant factor IXa with the complete 99-loop replaced with that of factor Xa, as described in Hopfner et al (15Hopfner K.P.

Analogously, rf10a-99loop(F9) denotes the recombinant factor Xa with the complete 99-loop replaced with that of factor IXa. The triple mutant rf9-Y94F/K98T/Y177T had a 7000-fold increased activity when compared with rf9a and a 1000-fold increased activity compared with the single mutant rf9a-K98T, resulting in an amidolytic activity comparable with that of rf10a. rf9–99loop(F10)-Y94F/Y177T had a 3-fold higher activity than rf9–99loop(F10) and a 51-fold increased activity compared with rf9a. The affinity for the S1-directed inhibitor PABA in the triple mutant was essentially the same as in rf9a, whereas in rf9–99loop(F10)-Y94F/Y177T it resembled that of rf9–99loop(F10) and increased ∼2-fold compared with rf9a. The selectivity of the mutants for the two substrates was in between those of rf9a and rf10a. Glu-219 is positioned at the entrance frame to the S1 site of fIXa. It is particularly interesting because Gly-219 is conserved in almost all trypsin-like serine proteases, including trypsin itself and the coagulation factors. Because Glu-219 has an apparently unchanged backbone conformation compared with trypsin (11Brandstetter H. Bauer M. Huber R. Lollar P. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab rf9-E219Q had a 30% decreased activity with substrate A, paralleled by a 20% decreased affinity for PABA. The selectivity for the two substrates was unchanged. rf9-S190A had a rather unaltered activity, whereas K i was increased by 82%. The selectivity was altered toward a preference for substrate A. The reactivity of some mutants in the presence of ethylene glycol was examined with two different substrates. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. All tested rf9a variants had a maximum stimulation at ∼35% ethylene glycol. The extent of stimulation correlates inversely with the catalytic turnover, which depends on both the mutant enzyme and the used substrate. The maximum 20-fold activity enhancement was observed with the wild-type rf9a and the worse substrate A (see Fig. 2). Analogously, the more active mutants showed less stimulation. The fXa mutant rf10a-99loop(F9), containing the fIXa-derived loop, was stimulated to a maximum of 1.5-fold at 15–20% ethylene glycol and was inhibited at concentrations above 27 and 37%, depending on the substrate. Wild type fXa is inhibited by ethylene glycol already at low concentrations. Even at millimolar concentrations, all zymogens were unable to auto-activate. This behavior contrasts that of related enzymes such as factor VII where the zymogen autoactivates spontaneously (23Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.-P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.-B. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Instead, the wild-type and mutant fIX enzymes required an exogenous protease (RVV-X) to cleave the peptide bond Arg-180–Val-181 (residues 15 and 16, chymotrypsinogen numbering) and to initially produce fIXaα. Notably, we observed significant differences in the rate of the subsequent cleavage at Arg-145–Ala-146 to generate fIXaβ. Although not quantified, the rate of fIXaα to fIXaβ conversion qualitatively correlated with the amidolytic activity of the mutants. Consistent herewith, the active site mutant rf9a-S195A was cleaved only once in the presence of RVV-X, thereby converting single chain rf9-S195A into the active conformation. Therefore, fIXa, but not RVV-X, performs the second cleavage at Arg-145–Ala-146, as proposed earlier (4Lindquist P.A. Fujikawa K. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro the activation of fIX requires two distinct enzymatic events. RVV-X performs the initial cleavage, at Arg-180–Val-181, of single chain fIX to produce fIXaα but is unable to complete activation to fIXaβ. Instead, the second cleavage, at Arg-145–Ala-146, is performed auto-catalytically by fIXa. This observation implies that proteolytic activation of fIX critically depends on the presence of an already active enzyme, contrasting the situation of, for example, fVII, which is able to auto-activate without a prior “jump start” (23Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.-P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.-B. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 24Pedersen A.H. Lund-Hansen T. Bisgaard-Frantzen H. Olsen F. Petersen L.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9331-9336Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the sequence similarity of both activation peptide cleavage sites, we expect active fIXa to be able to cleave at both sites. The need for an exogenous activator indicates that single-chain fIX is unable to undergo the conformational switch necessary for proteolytic activity (23Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.-P.

The active site mutant rf9a-S195A was cleaved only once in the presence of RVV-X, thereby converting single-chain rf9-S195A into the active conformation. Two-chain rf9a-S195A was not further processed. This contrasts the situation in related serine proteases, which display residual activity when carrying the corresponding mutation of the catalytic residue Ser-195 (26Stone S.R. LeBonniec B.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 344-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Olson S.T. Swanson R. Day D. Verhamme I. Kvassman J. Shore J.D.

D. 2000; 56: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Structure analysis indicated that Tyr-99 hinders the direct substrate access to the S4 binding site. Therefore, we replaced Tyr-99 with several smaller residues. Counterintuitively, the activity of these mutants decreased. The reactivity was lowest with the smallest side chain substitution, Y99A. Moreover, binding of the S1 inhibitor PABA was also impaired. This indicates that the removal of Tyr-99 results in complex changes, affecting not only the S2-S4 but also the S1 site by either blocking access to the primary specificity site or by even destabilizing its conformation. The side chain of Tyr-99 is the part of the 99-loop closest to the S1 pocket. Removal of the bulky side chain of Tyr-99 probably causes the loop to slide further into the S2-S4 substrate binding cleft. As a consequence, the positively charged side chain of Lys-98 comes closer to the entrance to S1 and repels basic substrate residues from binding into the primary specificity pocket. To elucidate the influence of charge and size of Lys-98 on substrate binding, the activity of mutants with uncharged and shorter side chains in position 98 was examined. rf9a-K98M has an increased activity, confirming the working hypothesis of an electrostatic repulsion of basic substrate residues by Lys-98. The activity of rf9a-K98T is even higher, in line with the assumption that in the wild-type enzyme both charge- and size-hinder substrate binding. The binding affinity of the S1 inhibitor PABA is doubled by the charge removal but independent of the size of the side chain at position 98. This indicates that, whereas the binding of positively charged P1 residues is electrostatically hindered by Lys-98, the size of the side chain at position 98 presumably only affects the accessibility to the S2/S4 site but not to the S1 site. The Ala95a/Ala95b insertion is specific to fIXa and, based on sequence comparison, is the most prominent difference to the related enzymes. Therefore, the deletion of these residues represents a straightforward approach to examine whether the low catalytic activity originates from these amino acids. However, the deletion of Ala95a/Ala95b did not have a significant impact on either activity or selectivity of rf9a. The unique conformation of the 99-loop in fIXa relates to several elements, including a two-residue insertion (Ala95a-Ala95b) and a series of more subtle structural characteristics. Its conformation is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl of Lys-98 and the hydroxyl of Tyr-94. Because fXa has a Phe-94, this hydrogen bond is not existent in fXa. Also, Tyr-177 and Lys-98, both of which are threonines (or serines) in fXa, fVIIa, and protein C, would collide if the fIXa-99-loop were to adopt an fXa-like conformation. Moreover, the structure analysis revealed that Tyr-177 stabilizes and locks the 99-loop in its inactive conformation by interactions with Asn-97 and Asn-100. This rationale was examined by constructing a triple mutant rf9a-Y94F/K98T/Y177T as well as a chimerical rf9a containing the 99-loop of fXa and the fXa-like environment of the loop (Y94F/Y177T). Both mutants had a largely increased amidolytic activity. rf9a-99loop(F10)-Y94F/Y177T did not achieve the same activity as the triple mutant. Although the access to the substrate binding cleft is facilitated, and the steric clash between Lys-98 and Tyr-177 has been removed, the heterologous loop can obviously not adopt the optimal conformation. In the highly active triple mutant rf9a-Y94F/K98T/Y177T, the 99-loop and the 177-segment probably approach the physiologically active conformation and open the active site cleft for substrate binding. These data suggest a mechanism of the physiological fIXa activation by cofactor and substrate binding. In this model, cofactor binding close to the 177-segment (5Giannelli F. Green P.M. Sommer S.S. Poon M. Ludwig M. Schwaab R. Reitsma P.H. Goossens M. Yoshioka A. Figueiredo M.S. Brownlee G.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10Banner D.W.

Nature. 1996; 380: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) will release the lock of the inactive 99-loop imposed by Tyr-177. Only the physiological substrate fX is able to rearrange the released 99-loop, paving itself its way into the active site cleft of fIXa. Both steps of the fIXa activation are combined in the triple mutant, explaining its high activity toward peptidic substrates. Notably, the conformation of the S1 site remains mainly unaltered in both multiple mutants as shown by the binding affinity of the S1 site inhibitor PABA (Table III). Thus, the introduced multiple mutations mainly affect the S2-S4 recognition sites. In serine proteases, the S1 site usually contributes most to substrate recognition and catalysis. Therefore, we examined the impact of mutations localized at the S1 site on the fIXa activity. None of the S1-directed mutations presented in this work and in earlier work (15Hopfner K.P. Brandstetter H. Karcher A. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Engh R.A. Bode W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6626-6635Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) resulted in an improved activity. Glu-219 is particularly intriguing because Gly-219 is conserved in almost all trypsin-like serine proteases, including trypsin itself and the coagulation factors. Although energetically unfavorable, Glu-219 has an apparently unchanged backbone conformation compared with trypsin. We attempted to clarify the importance of the charge of Glu-219 and its salt bridge with Lys-224 for fIXa activity by isosterically replacing it with Gln. Both activity and inhibitor binding were slightly impaired, indicating a moderate disturbance of the S1 site geometry. In the S190A mutant, the absence of a hydroxyl in the S1 site explains the weakening of PABA binding. If the S1 site is affected during physiological activation, these changes are very subtle and are difficult to mimic by mutagenesis. Alternatively, the primary specificity pocket may be only of minor relevance for cofactor activation. The latter hypothesis is supported by only small differences in PABA binding between fIXa and fXa (TableIV). Stürzebecher and co-workers (29Stürzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) speculate that the stimulation of fIXa activity by ethylene glycol and other alcohols is mediated by interaction of these alcohols with the 99-loop. Kolkman and Mertens (16Kolkman J.A. Mertens K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7398-7405Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) report that a fIXa variant with mutations in the 99-loop and increased amidolytic activity was stimulated by ethylene glycol to a lesser extent than the wild type but resulted in the same maximum activity. We recently showed that fIXa and fVIIa have a common ethylene glycol binding site between residues 60 and 90 that is not accessible in fXa (23Sichler K. Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Hopfner K.-P. Huber R. Bode W. Kresse G.-B. Kopetzki E. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Occupation of this site by ethylene glycol appears to mimic the effects of macromolecular substrate binding on the 99-loop. Thereby it stimulates catalysis of synthetic substrates in a way that is usually only observed for macromolecular substrates that are able to occupy both sites (60-loop region and active site cleft) simultaneously in the presence of fVIIIa. The decreased stimulation of the more active 99-loop mutants by ethylene glycol underlines this interpretation; the 99-loop is already reorganized in these mutants, thus precluding a further activity enhancement. FXa is not stimulated by ethylene glycol. An fXa variant with the 99-loop of fIXa was stimulated but only to less than 10% compared with fIXa. The inferior activity modulation of this mutant can be explained by the lack of a proper ethylene glycol binding site in fXa despite the presence of a 99-loop that is in principle susceptible to ethylene glycol stimulation in this mutant. fIXa has evolved as an enzyme with a strictly regulated activity. It is virtually inactive in the absence of cofactor and physiologic substrate. This can be attributed mainly to the 99-loop. The side chains of Tyr-99 and Lys-98 impair substrate binding and are only removed by major reorganizations of several parts of the enzyme after binding of both the cofactor and the substrate. This “closed conformation” of the active site cleft is guaranteed by several mechanisms. Lys-98, Tyr-94, and Tyr-177 prevent a spontaneous reorganization of the 99-loop. Tyr-99 blocks the canonical substrate binding but also stabilizes the whole loop. A spontaneous point mutation of Tyr-99 will, therefore, result in an even less active enzyme rather than open the substrate binding cleft. The cofactor and substrate-assisted activation of fIXa specified by our results together with other control mechanisms like Ca2+ and membrane dependence of fIXa activity emphasize the exceptionally important role of fIXa as a central enzyme of the coagulation cascade at the intersection between extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathway as well as between initiation and amplification of coagulation. Dysfunction of this enzyme is extremely dangerous in either direction and, therefore, underlies multiple control mechanisms."

M1 mouse myeloid leukemia cells arrest growth and differentiate into macrophages following treatment with interleukin 6 (IL-6) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and recent studies have shown that Stat3 plays a central role in this process. Utilizing representational difference analysis, we demonstrate that expression of the mouse BATF gene is upregulated as an early response to IL-6/LIF stimulation and Stat3 activation in this cell system. Immunoblots using antibodies to BATF detected an increase in BATF protein in response to LIF/IL-6 stimulation. BATF is a member of the AP-1 family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors and functions to inhibit the transcriptional and biological functions of AP-1 activity in mammalian cells. BATF forms complexes with c-Jun in M1 cells and forced expression of BATF in the absence of Stat3 signaling results in a reduced rate of cellular growth. These results indicate that Stat3 mediates cellular growth by modulating AP-1 activity through the induction of BATF."

Lecticans are proteoglycans that carry chondroitin sulfate (CS) side chains on core proteins encompassing a N-terminal hyaluronan binding domain and a C-terminal lectin domain. Four different members of the lectican protein family are known (neurocan, aggrecan, versican, and brevican) (1Ruoslahti E. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 489-492Google Scholar). Their multidomain composition enables lecticans to interact with multiple cell surface molecules and diffusible ligands (see below) (6Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Google Scholar,7Rauch U. Feng K. Zhou X.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1842-1856Google Scholar). Chondroitin sulfates are glycosaminoglycans composed of repeated glucuronic acid-[β1,3]-N-acetylgalactosamine disaccharide units that are linked by [β1,4]-glycosidic bonds into long unbranched chains with molecular masses of up to 50 kDa and more (8Kjellen L.

With respect to the position of sulfate esters at the galactosamine, CSA (C-4-S, containing C-4-sulfate) and CSC (C-6-S, containing C-6-sulfate) are distinguished. The expression of these proteoglycan core proteins is precisely tuned during brain development (9Miller B. Sheppard A.M. Bicknese A.R. Pearlman A.L. J. Comp.

The functions of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CS-PGs) in neural tissue can be categorized into effects on cell adhesion, cell migration, neurite formation, neuron polarization, synaptic modulation/plasticity, and neuron survival (for reviews, see Ref. 6Bandtlow C.E.

Many of the listed functions, however, have been discovered using in vitro experiments that were designed in a way that the proteoglycan or glycosaminoglycan component became limiting in the assays.

Inactivation of enzymes involved in CS biosynthesis, on the other hand, could lead to more severe phenotypes since CS is a component of multiple ECM proteins. In the chondroitin-6-sulfate transferase knockout mouse, however, no major CNS pathology was found (15Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Nishimura H. Muramatsu H. Nakamura E. Kurosawa N. Habuchi O., El- Fasakhany F.M. Yoshikai Y. Muramatsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1443-1450Google Scholar). C-6-S may be replaced by C-4-S, and expression data suggest that C-4-S is probably more important in the developing brain. Nevertheless, the importance of CS in vivois underscored impressively by the observation that after local treatment with chondroitinase ABC, which degrades C-4-S, C-6-S, and dermatan sulfate, regeneration of functional neurites in the adult spinal cord is enabled (16Bradbury E.J. Moon L.D. Popat R.J. King V.R. Bennett G.S. Patel P.N. Fawcett J.W. McMahon S.B. Nature. 2002; 416: 636-640Google Scholar). Thus, CS-PGs are considered to contribute to the inhibition of regenerative responses in the adult mammalian nervous system. The current insight into the mechanisms of how CS acts on neurons is still rudimentary. Binding partners of CS-PGs at the plasma membrane include sulfatide and several (eventually glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored) cell adhesion molecules of the Ig family such as N-CAM, L1, TAG-1, and F3/contactin (for a review, see Ref. 6Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Google Scholar). The signaling events exerted after binding of CS-PGs to these molecules are unknown. On the other hand, CS-PGs bind a variety of soluble ligands including growth factors like bovine fibroblast growth factor and oligomeric glycoproteins of the ECM-like tenascins (6Bandtlow C.E. Zimmermann D.R. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1267-1290Google Scholar). Interestingly, CS is a critical component of a molecular scaffold to which diffusible molecules are bound that convey inhibitory or promoting actions, e.g. on the adhesion of thalamic neurons and the formation of neurites (17Emerling D.E. Lander A.D. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1089-1100Google Scholar). The identity of these diffusible molecules, however, is as yet unknown. To elucidate the molecular basis of the neurotrophic actions of chondroitin sulfate, we previously fractionated protein extracts from neonatal rat brain on a chondroitin sulfate affinity column and used the eluted binding proteins to generate monoclonal antibodies (18Junghans U. Franken S. Pommer A. Müller W. Viebahn C. Kappler J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 317-325Google Scholar). One of these antibodies, termed mAb-9, recognizes a 65-kDa protein with laminar expression in the neocortex, which parallels the expression of CS. The protein is present in both the fraction of soluble proteins and in the particulate fraction of neonatal rat brain. The aim of the present study was to identify this chondroitin sulfate-binding protein and to characterize its interaction with glycosaminoglycans. We show that mAb-9 recognizes a soluble protein that is present in the cytosol, termed collapsin response mediator protein-4 (CRMP-4). This protein and its relatives interact with chondroitin sulfate, and they are released from the cytosol of neurons to the extracellular space most probably after cell death. This may explain why CRMP-4 was found to be co-localized with chondroitin sulfate in the developing neocortex of rat brain in regions where naturally occurring cell death is prevalent. Unless otherwise stated, chemicals were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), Sigma, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, or Merck. ZERO Blunt vector for PCR cloning was from Invitrogen, and pQE-30 vector for bacterial expression of histidine-tagged proteins was from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). SDS-PAGE was performed on 5–15% gradient slab gels (Bio-Rad Protean II) or 10% mini-gels (Bio-Rad MiniProtean) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Gels were stained by silver (20Ansorge W. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1985; 11: 13-20Google Scholar), Coomassie Blue, or zinc/imidazole (21Fernandez-Patron C. Calero M. Collazo P.R. Garcia J.R. Madrazo J. Musacchio A. Soriano F. Estrada R. Frank R. Castellanos-Serra L.R. Mendez E. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 203-211Google Scholar). For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose in a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad) according to Kyhse-Andersen (22Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Google Scholar). After blocking with 3% nonfat dry milk powder, 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), the first antibody incubation was performed for 1 h at room temperature in TBST. Bound antibodies were visualized after binding of peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, AmershamBiosciences). Whole brains from neonatal Wistar rats were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2 (HEPES buffer) containing 2 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm leupeptin, and 1 mm pepstatin. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h to obtain soluble protein. Forty milligrams of this protein material were loaded on a 1-ml Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with 10 column volumes of loading buffer (HEPES buffer), and eluted stepwise with 5 column volumes of HEPES buffer containing 100, 300, 500, and 2000 mm NaCl. One-milliliter fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, silver staining and Western blot with mAb-9. Western positive fractions were concentrated (Centricon10, Millipore) and loaded on a 25-ml Superose-12 column (Amersham Biosciences). Again, 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by Western blotting. For mass spectrometry, proteins were prepared according to the method of Gevaert et al. (23Gevaert K. Verschelde J.L. Puype M. Van Damme J. Goethals M., De Boeck S. Vandekerckhove J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 918-924Google Scholar). Briefly, the positive fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and separated by SDS-PAGE. After staining with zinc/imidazole the protein bands corresponding to the Western signal of the monoclonal antibody were excised. After destaining in 5% citric acid for 15 min and another 3 times for 15 min in deionized water and incubation in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 12 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue for 1 h, the gel was cut into small pieces (5 × 5 mm) and loaded on top of a concentration gel (5% acrylamide, 0.26% bisacrylamide, 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% SDS) inside of a Pasteur pipette (length, 145 mm). The pipette was transferred to an isoelectro-focusing unit (Bio-Rad), and the gel pieces were carefully overlayered with running buffer (50 mm Tris, 190 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS). Electrophoresis at 250 V was continued until the bromphenol blue approached the lower edge of the pipette. The gel was removed from the Pasteur pipette and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the sharp blue protein band in the lower part of the pipette was excised, destained, and stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Aliquots of this material were analyzed by Western blotting to confirm hat the desired protein had been excised. The destained gel piece was washed twice in digestion buffer (10 mmNH4HCO3) for 15 min and twice for 15 min in digestion buffer/acetonitrile 1:1 (v/v). The gel piece was re-swollen with 2 μl of protease solution (trypsin at 0.05 μg/μl in digestion buffer), and after 20 min another 10 μl of digestion buffer was added. After digestion overnight at 37 °C the supernatant was collected and dried down to about 0.5 μl. For nanospray ESI-MS 2 μl of 70% formic acid were added, and this solution was used in 0.5-μl aliquots. ESI-MS was done as described (24Immler D. Gremm D. Kirsch D. Spengler B. Presek P. Meyer H.E. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1015-1023Google Scholar) using a TSQ 7000 Triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) equipped with the standard ESI source or an in-house constructed nanospray source. The ESI-voltage was between 0.6 and 1.1 kV for nanospray. Mass spectra were acquired with a scan speed of 1000 Da/s. For ESI-MS/MS analysis, argon at a pressure of 3 millitorr was used as collision gas. Data acquisition and evaluation were done on a DEC work station using the ICIS software, version 8.2.1. Peptide mass calculation was done with the BIOWORKS software, version 8.2.1. Peptide masses obtained from in-gel digestion were used for searching the SwissProt.r34 data base with MS-FIT (falcon.ludwig.ucl.ac.uk/msfit.htm). The standard parameters were: species Rattus norvegicus, molecular mass 40–100 kDa, tryptic digest with a maximum of 1 missed cleavage site. Peptide masses were assumed to be monoisotopic, and cysteine was assumed to be not modified. The allowed mass error was set at 0.1%. First-strand cDNA was amplified after reverse transcription of 3 μg of a mixture of E17/P4 rat brain RNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions using an oligo-dT primer. After digestion with RNase H one-tenth of the reaction was used as template for PCR amplification by Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using 94 °C for 90 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min for 30 cycles. The following primer sequences were used: CRMP-1(5′), 5′-ATGTCTCATCAGGGGAAGAAGAG-3′, CRMP-1(3′), 5′-TATCTGGCGCATCTGAGGTCAACC-3′, CRMP-2(5′), 5′-ATGTCTTATCAGGGGAAGAAAAAT-3′, CRMP-2(3′), 5′-GCAGGCCTAGGAGCTTTAGCCCAG-3′), CRMP-3(5′), 5′-ATGTCCTTCCAAGGCAAGAAGAGCATTCCCCGGATA-3′, CRMP-3(3′), 5′-TGCCAGACCCCAAGTCTAAGAAAG-3′, CRMP-4(5′), 5′-CAGAATCGCCACCATGTC-3′, CRMP-4(3′), 5′-GAGGGCTTAACTCAGGGA-3′. The PCR products were cloned into the ZERO Blunt vector and sequenced using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. Bacterial overexpression inEscherichia coli was performed using the Qiaexpress kit (Qiagen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The coding regions of the four CRMP-cDNAs were re-amplified using primers containing restriction sites for SalI and HindIII and the pCR Blunt vectors containing the CRMP inserts as templates. The following primer sequences were used: CRMP-1(5′)Sal, 5′-ACCTAGCGTCGACACATAGAAGGTAGAATGTCTCATCAGGGG-3′; CRMP-1(3′)Hind, 5′-CGCCGCAAGCTTTATCTGGCGCATCTGAGG-3′; CRMP-2(5′)Sal, 5′-ACCTAGCGTCGACACATAGAAGGTAGAATGTCTTATCAGGGG-3′; CRMP-2(3′)Hind, 5′-CGCCGCAAGCTTGCAGGCCTAGGAGCTTTA-3′; CRMP-3(5′)Sal, 5′-ACCTAGCGTCGACACATAGAAGGTAGAATGTCCTTCCAAGGC-3′; CRMP-3(3′)Hind, 5′-CGCCGCAAGCTTTGCCAGACCCCAAGTCTA-3′; CRMP-4(5′)Sal, 5′-ACCTAGCGTCGACACATGTCCTACCAGGGCAAGAAG-3′; CRMP-4(3′)Hind, 5′-CGCCGCAAGCTTACTCAGGGATGTGATGTTAGA-3′. The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with SalI and HindIII, and ligated into the pQE-30 expression vector, thereby incorporating a 5′ extension of the cDNA coding for a His6 tag. M15[pRep] bacteria were transformed, and ampicillin/kanamycin resistant strains were analyzed for CRMP cDNA inserts and sequenced to verify ligation sites and the PCR products. Positive strains were grown in Luria Bertani medium containing kanamycin and ampicillin, and expression was induced by 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were lysed in Tris/phosphate buffer containing 8 m urea, and expression of recombinant His-tagged CRMP proteins was tested by Western blot with an anti-RGS-His antibody (Qiagen). Antibodies raised in rabbit against the synthetic peptides CRMP-4-pep (FDLTTTPKGGTPAGSTRGSPTRPN, rCRMP-4 residues 504–527) and CRMP-Fam-pep (SFYADIYMEDGLIKQIGDN, rCRMP-4 residues 30–48) were obtained from Pineda Antiköper Service, Berlin, Germany. CRMP-1-pep (YEVPATPKHAAPAPSAKSSPSKHQ, rCRMP-1 residues 504–527), CRMP-2-pep-a (CEVSVTPKTVTPASSAKTSPAKQQ, rCRMP-2 residues 504–527), CRMP-2-pep-b (GIQEEMEALVKDHGV, rCRMP-2 residues 147–161), CRMP-3-pep (HEVMLPAKPGSGTQARASCSGKIS, rCRMP-3 residues 496–519) were synthesized as described (25Kappler J. Franken S. Junghans U. Hoffmann R. Linke T. Müller H.W. Koch K.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 287-291Google Scholar) and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 59-123Google Scholar) via additional N-terminal cysteine residues. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits (Lammers, Euskirchen, Germany). For the first immunization 200 μg of peptide dissolved in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) was injected subcutaneously. Each animal was boosted twice at intervals of 4 weeks with the same amount of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). For the immunization protocol, special permission according to Section 8 of the German Law on the Protection of Animals had been obtained from the Bezirksregierung Köln. All rabbit antisera were used at a dilution of 1:10,000 for Western blotting. Monospecific IgG was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with the peptides immobilized on thiol-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 59-123Google Scholar). Purified IgG was ultra-filtered into 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5. After the addition of 10 μl of 150 mm NHS-Biotin (Pierce) the antibody solution was incubated at 4 °C overnight. IgG was then separated from the unreacted free biotin by size exclusion chromatography on NAP10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Chondroitin sulfate was coupled to EAH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described (18Junghans U. Franken S. Pommer A. Müller W. Viebahn C. Kappler J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 317-325Google Scholar). As control columns, heparin Hitrap, SP Hitrap, and CM Hitrap 1-ml columns (Amersham Biosciences) were used. Approximately 10 mg of soluble neonatal rat brain proteins obtained after ultracentrifugation of postnuclear supernatants at 100,000 × g for 1 h were filtered (0.45 μm) and chromatographed on 1-ml analytical columns using an Äkta Explorer equipment (Amersham Biosciences). Runs on CS columns and control columns were carried out in parallel, taking advantage of the column-scouting routine of the Unicorn 3.1 software using sequential step elution with PBS containing 300 mm NaCl, 750 mm NaCl, 2 m NaCl, and 4 mguanidinium hydrochloride (GuaHCl) as described (18Junghans U. Franken S. Pommer A. Müller W. Viebahn C. Kappler J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 317-325Google Scholar). To remove the salt from the eluent fractions and to concentrate the proteins, they were precipitated with acetone (−20 °C) and washed twice with 80% ethanol (4 °C) before Western blot analysis with the peptide-specific antibodies against CRMPs. 1-ml aliquots of soluble neonatal rat brain proteins prepared as described above were incubated with 1 μl of the different peptide-specific CRMP antisera for 1 h at 4 °C and with 10 μl of protein A-agarose (Calbiochem) for an additional hour at 4 °C with continuous rocking. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline, dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting with the biotinylated CRMP-Fam antibody or CS56 (Sigma) against CS. Before brain dissection, animals were perfused with standard mammalian Ringer's solution, pH 7.4, followed by 3.7% formaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed for 16 h and washed extensively in tap water. After dehydration in a series of increasing ethanol concentrations, brain tissue was embedded in paraffin, and 10-μm sections were cut on a microtome (Leica HM 355 S). Sections were mounted on Histobond slides, dried for 2 days at 37 °C, and used for immunohistochemistry. First, sections were deparaffinized and hydrated by decreasing concentrations of ethanol in H2O. Afterward, sections were incubated in boiling 2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) for 20 min. After equilibrating in PBS, sections were treated with 1% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min to remove endogenous peroxidase activity. After permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, sections were washed with PBS and incubated in a 4% bovine serum albumin, PBS solution for at least 30 min. First, antibodies to CRMP-4 were used in a dilution of 1:1000, and for CS56 (Sigma), in a dilution of 1:200 (all in 4% bovine serum albumin, PBS). Sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing, sections were treated with the secondary biotinylated antibody diluted 1:200 in 4% bovine serum albumin, PBS, washed again, and incubated in a streptavidin-peroxidase complex (ABC-kit, Vector). After a 1-h incubation, sections were washed intensively and stained with diaminobenzidine (0.05% in Tris-buffered saline). Counterstaining was done with hemalum (Mayers hemalum, 1:6 dilution in H2O, Merck) for 5 min followed by several washes in H2O and a final wash in tap water. Pictures were taken with a digital camera (Polaroid DMC Ie, Cambridge, UK) connected to a Zeiss Axioskop 2 (Jena). NTera-2 precursor cells (Stratagene) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cell death was induced by feeding the cells with medium without FCS after repeated washings with serum-free medium. Conditioned medium was harvested after 3 days and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 15 min to remove floating cells and debris. For Western blot analysis, conditioned medium was subjected to Q-Sepharose (Hitrap 1-ml column, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography to capture CRMPs using elution with a linear gradient from 150 mm to 1 m NaCl in phosphate buffer. Primary neocortical neurons were prepared as described (27Junghans U. Koops A. Westmeyer A. Kappler J. Meyer H.E. Müller H.W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2341-2350Google Scholar) and plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm cell culture Petri dishes (Falcon) or 6-well cell culture plates (Sarstedt). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C in humidified 10% CO2, 90% air for 16–24 h and analyzed by phase contrast microscopy. To visualize the morphology of nuclei, cultures were fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with PBS, and stained briefly with 4,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole (100 μg/ml in PBS). Pictures were taken with a digital camera (Axiovision, Zeiss) connected to a Zeiss Axiovert 100M, and images were processed with the Axiovision software (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Protein determination was performed with the Bradford assay or the detergent-compatible protein assay (both purchased from Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was determined as described (28Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody mAb-9 used in this study recognizes a 65-kDa protein that is abundant in the soluble fraction of neonatal rat brain (18Junghans U. Franken S. Pommer A. Müller W. Viebahn C. Kappler J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 317-325Google Scholar). From this material the 65-kDa protein was captured on a Mono Q anion exchange column (Fig. 1). When steps of increasing ionic strength were applied to the column, about 30% of the cross-reacting protein was eluted with 200 mm sodium chloride, and the remaining 70% was released at 500 mmsodium chloride according to Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the electrophoretic mobility of the cross-reacting protein bands from the eluate fractions was slower in comparison to the starting material (Fig. 1C). Because the 200 mm NaCl eluate contained a lower amount of contaminating proteins than the 500 mm eluate, according to silver-stained SDS-gels (Fig. 1 B), fraction 7 from the Mono Q column was subsequently fractionated using size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 12 column (Fig. 2). From this column the cross-reacting protein eluted after 11–12 ml, corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 2, A and C). Finally, purification to homogeneity was achieved by preparative SDS-PAGE (data not shown). In-gel digestion with trypsin yielded 22 peptides, which were analyzed by ESI-MS. In the SwissProt.r34 rat sequence data base (Table I) 10/22 peptide masses fitted to a rat sequence homologous to “Turned on after division” protein of 64 kDa (TOAD-64 (29Minturn J.E. Fryer H.J. Geschwind D.H. Hockfield S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6757-6766Google Scholar), also called collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2 (30Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Google Scholar)). Extension of the search to the entire mammalian data base (nrdb, EMBL Heidelberg), however, showed a more close match of 15/22 peptides to mouse CRMP-4 (mUlip, Unc33-like phosphoprotein (31Byk T. Dobransky T. Cifuentes-Diaz C. Sobel A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 688-701Google Scholar)). Furthermore, MS/MS analyses of three different peptides from the spectrum confirmed that these were derived from the rat homologue of CRMP-4. Because only a truncated cDNA sequence for rat CRMP-4 was available in the data base, a chimeric sequence was assembled from the available truncated rat CRMP-4 and mouse CRMP-4/mUlip. To this chimeric sequence 19 of the 22 obtained masses could be matched exactly (data not shown). Thus, the mass spectrometric analyses indicate that mAb-9 recognizes collapsin response mediator protein-4 from rat brain.Figure 2Gel filtration chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2009424709,"glutamate receptor adenosine deaminase acting on RNA neurofibromatosis type 1 RNA editing is the changing of a nucleotide sequence at one or more positions within an RNA transcript. Hence, editing leads to the formation of transcripts, the sequence of which differs from that found in the genome. RNA editing was initially described in the 1980s in a unicellular protozoan (1Benne R. Van den Burg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Sloof P. Van Boom J.H. Tromp M.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 819-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and soon thereafter in the mouse (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 3Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar) and also in a viral pathogen that affects humans (4Cattaneo R. Schmid A. Eschle D. Baczko K. ter Meulen V. Billeter M.A. Cell. 1988; 55: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The frame-shifted cytochrome oxidasecoxII gene transcript of trypanosome mitochondria provided the first example of RNA editing when it was found to contain four inserted uridines that were not encoded by the genomic DNA (1Benne R. Van den Burg J. Brakenhoff J.P. Sloof P. Van Boom J.H. Tromp M.C. Cell. 1986; 46: 819-826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Subsequently, editing by nucleotide substitution was described for the apolipoprotein B (apoB) transcript in mouse intestine (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) and the glutamate-gated ion channel (GluR-B)1 transcript in mouse brain (3Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). ApoB mRNA possesses a UAA translational stop codon, at a position where the genomic DNA specifies a CAA glutamine codon (2Powell L.M. Wallis S.C. Pease R.J. Edwards Y.H. Knott T.J. Scott J. Cell. 1987; 50: 831-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). The edited GluR-B mRNA possesses a CIG arginine codon (I is recognized as G by decoding ribosomes), whereas unedited mRNA possesses the genome-encoded CAG glutamine codon at the same position (3Sommer B. Kohler M. Sprengel R. Seeburg P.H. Cell. 1991; 67: 11-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). Finally, measles virus RNA isolated from brains of persistently infected subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients were shown to possess multiple differences from the sequence of the viral RNA genome, differences that correspond to A-to-G and U-to-C substitution mutations (4Cattaneo R. Schmid A. Eschle D. Baczko K. ter Meulen V. Billeter M.A. Cell. 1988; 55: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). RNA editing now is known to occur in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms and their viruses (5Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 6Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 7Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol.

The two minireviews in this issue focus on the genetic and biochemical aspects of nucleotide substitution RNA editing by deamination, either A-to-I (8Maas S. Rich A. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1391-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) or C-to-U (9Blanc V. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The substrates and enzymes responsible for these editing processes are reviewed, along with the functional roles that representative editing events play in cellular processes. A third minireview that focused on 2′-O-methyl ribose nucleotide modification, uridine to pseudouridine conversion, and RNA-guided editing events mediated by small nucleolar RNA cofactor guides and associated proteins was published recently (10Decatur W.A. Fournier M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the first minireview, Stefan Maas, Alexander Rich, and Kazuko Nishikura in their article entitled “A-to-I Editing: Recent News and Residual Mysteries” review new developments in the biochemistry and biology of editing by C-6 adenosine deamination (8Maas S. Rich A. Nishikura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1391-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recent advances in understanding the physiologic significance of individual members of the multigene family of adenosinedeaminases that act on RNA (ADAR) enzymes, and the biochemical activities associated with the double-stranded RNA binding, Z-DNA binding, and catalytic domains of the ADAR deaminases are described. The enzymatic deamination of adenosine in pre-mRNAs and other structured RNAs is evaluated in the context of the components of the RNA editing machinery that carry out deamination editing of the A-to-I variety. The expression of ADAR enzymes is a complex process. This is illustrated by theADAR1 gene, where alternative promoters including one inducible by interferons together with alternative splicing give rise to different protein isoforms. Information derived from the study of gene disruptions of ADARs has led to important insights into the roles of A-to-I editing. Pre-mRNA substrates encoding glutamate receptor and serotonin 2C receptor proteins provide two examples whereby A-to-I editing gives rise to amino acid substitutions, changes that alter the sequences and hence activities of the encoded proteins. The second minireview of the series by Valerie Blanc and Nicholas O. Davidson entitled “C-to-U RNA Editing: Mechanisms Leading to Genetic Diversity,” summarizes progress in understanding the biochemical mechanisms and substrate targets for C-to-U RNA editing in mammals (9Blanc V. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Like A-to-I editing, C-to-U RNA editing is catalyzed by a deaminase that acts on the target RNA substrate. However, important differences exist between the biochemistry of C-to-U and A-to-I editing. The known C-to-U editing events involve a single-strand substrate, occur on spliced RNAs in the nucleus, and are mediated by a multicomponent complex that includes one or more associated protein complementation factors in addition to the catalytic deaminase (apobec-1). ApoB and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) mRNA substrates provide two examples whereby C-to-U editing gives rise to translational stop codons that shorten the respective open reading frames and hence coding capacity of the mRNAs. Altering the information transfer process at the post-transcriptional level of gene expression by nucleotide substitution editing through A or C deamination mechanisms represents an important strategy for amplifying genetic diversity and modifying the functions of products encoded by an organism's genome (5Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 6Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 7Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Some of the established and potential roles that A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing plays, or may play, in biologic processes are summarized in Fig. 1. These include effects on mRNA translation, pre-mRNA splicing, RNA degradation, RNA replication, and RNA structure that result from A-to-I or C-to-U deaminations (5Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 6Bass B.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 817-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 7Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 1395-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Site-specific editing may change the coding potential of mRNA transcripts, leading to proteins with altered function due to amino acid substitutions following A-to-I editing, as exemplified by GluR-B and serotonin 2C receptor proteins. Introduction or removal of translation termination codons may also occur, as exemplified by apoB and NF1 mRNAs where C-to-U editing generates UAA and UGA translation stop codons, respectively, and hepatitis delta virus RNA where A-to-I editing converts an amber UAG stop to an UIC tryptophan codon. ADAR2 edits its own transcript to create an alternative splice acceptor site. Additionally, a novel ribonuclease selective for inosine-containing RNAs has been identified, which creates the possibility that A-to-I edited transcripts may be degraded preferentially relative to the unedited transcripts. For some viral RNAs, modifications characteristic of adenosine deamination are seen which, following RNA replication, would be expected under certain conditions to lead to changes in the encapsidated viral genome sequence. Finally, sequence changes resulting from editing may subsequently affect RNA structure and hence function, including altered binding of RNA by proteins (Fig. 1). Much progress has been made in our understanding of the mechanisms and roles of RNA editing. Identification of additional mRNA substrates that undergo editing by deamination and establishing the functional roles that editing events play in biologic processes, together with further definition of the biochemical and regulatory mechanisms of A-to-I and C-to-U editing, present some of the immediate challenges and opportunities in the RNA editing field."
https://openalex.org/W2031415555,"During differentiation of skeletal myoblasts, MyoD promotes growth arrest through the induction of the cdk inhibitor p21 and the accumulation of hypophosphorylated RB protein. Myoblasts lacking RB function fail to accomplish full differentiation and undergo apoptosis. Here we show that exogenous MyoD induces apoptosis in several cell backgrounds sharing RB inactivation. This process is associated with increased levels of cell cycle-driving proteins and aberrant cell cycle progression. The inability of MyoD to induce apoptosis in a p21-null background, highlights a requirement of p21 in RB-regulated apoptosis during myogenesis. This pro-apoptotic function of p21 cannot be exerted by simple p21 over-expression, but requires the co-operation of MyoD. We also suggest that the essential aspect of p21 activity involved in such a process is related to its ability to induce the nuclear accumulation and aberrant activity of cyclin/cdk complexes. These results establish a novel link between MyoD, p21 and RB during myogenesis, providing new insights into the antagonism between muscle differentiation and loss of RB function."

These covalent bonds had no major effects on the biotin binding properties of the respective mutants. Moreover, one of the mutants (Avd-ccci) maintained its tetrameric integrity even in denaturing conditions. The new avidin forms Avd-ci and Avd-ccci, which have native → denatured transition midpoints (<i>T<sub>m</sub></i>) of 98.6 and 94.7 °C, respectively, in the absence of biotin, will find use in applications where extreme stability or minimal leakage of subunits is required. Furthermore, we showed that the intramonomeric disulfide bridges found in the wild-type avidin affect its stability. The mutant Avd-nc, in which this bridge was removed, had a lower <i>T<sub>m</sub></i> in the absence of biotin than the wild-type avidin but showed comparable stability in the presence of biotin."

The pregenomic RNA is the template for reverse transcription and also the bicistronic mRNA for core and polymerase. The pregenomic RNA structure and the capsid stoichiometry imply that vastly more core would be translated than polymerase.

All hepadnaviruses share a high degree of hepatotropism, are highly species-specific, employ the same replication cycle, and share a nearly identical genetic organization. These viruses have an envelope studded with viral glycoproteins that surrounds an icosahedral core particle. The shell of the core particle is formed from the viral C1 protein, and it contains the viral nucleic acids and the viral reverse transcriptase, known as the P protein. Hepadnaviral reverse transcription occurs in cytoplasmic core particles. Core particle formation begins with binding of P to the ε stem loop at the 5′ end of the viral pgRNA (5Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D.

This complex is then encapsidated through polymerization of 120 dimers of C around it (8Crowther R.A. Kiselev N.A. Bottcher B. Berriman J.A. Borisova G.P. Ose V. Pumpens P. Cell. 1994; 77: 943-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar,9Bottcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Encapsidation appears to be rapid because no intermediates between dimers of C and complete particles have been found in cells (10Seifer M. Zhou S. Standring D.N. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 249-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the three viral products needed for encapsidation (pgRNA, C, and P) is closely linked because the pgRNA is also a bicistronic mRNA that encodes C and P (11Ou J.H. Bao H. Shih C. Tahara S.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4578-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lin C.G. Lo S.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Fouillot N. Rossignol J.M. J.

C and P are both translated byde novo initiation from their ORFs on the bicistronic pgRNA (15Chang L.J. Pryciak P. Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16Schlicht H.J. Radziwill G. Schaller H. Cell. 1989; 56: 85-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C accumulates in cells to easily detectable levels that rise steadily over the first few days of expression in liver or in cultured cells. The accumulation pattern of P has never been directly measured because of the lack of appropriate antibodies. Expression of P is believed to be very low for three reasons. First, P is translated from the downstream ORF of the bicistronic pgRNA. Such ORFs are usually very poorly translated, especially when the context of the initiation codon (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is suboptimal and there are multiple upstream AUGs, as is the case for P. Second, the best estimate indicates that only one or two P molecules are within each core particle (18Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), and thus little P would be needed relative to C for assembly of core particles. Third, using kinase epitope-tagged P, it has been proposed that P is a translational repressor (18Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). These observations led to the idea that slow translation of P is the rate-limiting step in encapsidation (18Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). However, using specific antibodies for P, we found that DHBV P accumulates in the cytoplasm to detectable levels and that the majority of P in cells is not encapsidated (19Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, much more P accumulates in cells than was anticipated. The mechanism of the accumulation of this excess P and its biological function are unknown. P could be translated slowly and have a very long half-life. Alternatively, P could be translated rapidly relative to the demands of P for encapsidation. In any case, the kinetics of P biosynthesis and turnover could play an important role in viral assembly and thus on viral replication, pathology, or antigen presentation by infected cells. To understand the kinetic mechanism for the expression of excess DHBV P in cells, we performed a quantitative analysis of P and C expression and degradation. These experiments are the first such experiments to directly analyze P using specific antibodies rather than employing surrogate reporter genes, and thus this is the first analysis of the synthesis and degradation of P in the context of ongoing reverse transcription. DHBV Type 3 was employed (20Sprengel R. Kuhn C. Will H. Schaller H. J. Med. Virol. 1985; 15: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). D1.5G is an overlength DHBV3 expression construct containing a 5′ duplication of nucleotides 1658–3021 in pBluescript(−) (Stratagene). Mutations introduced into D1.5G were dlCore (deletion of nucleotides 2846–2849 that truncates C and blocks encapsidation); P-OF (deletion of nucleotide 424 that truncates P after amino acid 84 (15)); and dlBulge (deletion of nucleotides 2571–2576 that removes the bulge of ε and blocks binding of P and encapsidation (21Pollack J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5579-5587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). LMH cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as recommended by the manufacturer. LMH cells were lysed in 0.75× or 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× is 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 3 μg/ml leupeptin on ice for 10 min, and the lysates were clarified at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, antibody was bound to protein A/G-agarose (Oncogene Research Products) and incubated with lysates at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplexes were washed three times with 1 ml of 0.75× or 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and proteins were released with Laemmli buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by PhosphorImager analysis or Western blotting. For Western blotting, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore) membranes. P was detected with anti-DTP3′-His monoclonal antibody mAb9. Following incubation with the appropriate IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega), P was visualized by incubation with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected LMH cells were washed twice with DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine (labeling medium) and pulsed with labeling medium supplemented with 120 μCi/ml EasyTag Express (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1% fetal bovine serum. For pulse-chase experiments, cells were labeled for 15 min (for P) or 3 h (for C), rapidly washed twice with DMEM/F12, and then fed with DMEM/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Great effort was taken to perform these steps as rapidly as possible, and all media were equilibrated to 37 °C/5% CO2 prior to use. Cells were incubated at 37 °C/5% CO2 for varying times and then placed on an ice-water slurry and lysed for immunoprecipitation. Following SDS-PAGE, radioactive P or C was detected and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis. The molar translation ratio of P and C (P/C; moles of P min−1/moles of C min−1) was calculated by dividing the total amount of P made during the labeling period by the total amount of C made during the same period. Because the half-life of C in LMH cells is too long to be measured (i.e. C does not degrade appreciably), all label that was incorporated into C was detected by immunoprecipitation. Determining the total amount of P synthesized presented two problems. First, P has more methionine and cysteine residues than C, and thus it is labeled to a higher molar specific activity. Therefore, the amount of radioactivity incorporated by P was divided by 8.6 to correct for the differing numbers and proportions of methionine and cysteine residues in the two proteins. Second, the half-life of P is very short, so the large majority of P synthesized over the labeling period was degraded and was not detected by immunoprecipitation. We corrected for this difference by calculating the total amount of P synthesized from its half-life and the amount of radioactivity detected in P by immunoprecipitation. The first-order decay equation is y(t) =y 0 e −λ t , wherey 0 is the instantaneous synthesis rate, λ is the decay constant, and t is decay time. The radioactivity detected by immunoprecipitation (A) is the area under the decay curve for the labeling period (T), as shown in Equation 1.A=∫0Ty0e−λtdtEquation 1 The solution to this equation isy 0 =A/[(1/λ)-(1/λ)e −λ T ]. Solving for λ in terms of half-life (T 12) yields λ = −ln(0.5)/T 12. The instantaneous translation rate, y 0, was calculated from these equations. We then assumed that the translation rate remained constant during the labeling period and multipliedy 0 by T to yield the total amount of P synthesized. The half-life of P was determined by transfecting LMH cells with DHBV expression constructs and performing pulse-chase experiments at day 1 or 3 after transfection. There are no cell lines infectable by DHBV, but transfection of LMH chicken hepatoma cells with expression constructs for DHBV (e.g. D1.5G) produces viral core particles competent for reverse transcription and results in release of infectious virions from the cells (22Condreay L.D. Aldrich C.E. Coates L. Mason W.S. Wu T.T. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected LMH cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min, washed twice with non-radioactive medium, supplied with non-radioactive medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and incubated for various times. At each time point, cells were lysed, P was immunoprecipitated, and radioactivity in P was determined by phosphorimage analysis. This assay measures the half-life of nonencapsidated P because encapsidated P cannot be precipitated with anti-P antibodies (19Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A representative experiment for wild-type D1.5G-transfected cells at day 3 after transfection is shown in Fig. 1. Table I shows that nonencapsidated P had a very short half-life of 25 min at day 1 and 15 min at day 3.Table IHalflife of nonencapsidated PDNACharacteristicHalf-life (day 1)Half-life (day 3)D.15GDHBV expression vector25.3 ± 4.015.2 ± 1.5D1.5G(ɛ-dlBulge)1-aEncapsidation defective.D1.5G where ɛ cannot bind P26.5 ± 5.215.3 ± 2.6D1.5G(dlCore)1-aEncapsidation defective.D1.5G where C is truncated23.8 ± 2.916.6 ± 1.7Each value is the halflife in minutes ± the standard deviation from 2–5 determinations.1-a Encapsidation defective.

A representative experiment with D1.5G-transfected cells at 3 days after transfection is in Fig. 1. Chase periods as long as 29 h revealed no reproducible diminution of the radioactivity immunoprecipitated. The amount of radioactive C immunoprecipitated in pulse-chase experiments could be reduced by secretion of virus particles or by degradation of C. The persistence of radioactive C indicates that C is stable in this system and that its degradation and secretion rates can be ignored in kinetic analyses. The negligible secretion rate is consistent with the low rate of production of mature viruses from LMH cells at early times after transfection (data not shown). P and C are translated from the bicistronic pgRNA (11Ou J.H. Bao H. Shih C. Tahara S.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4578-4581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lin C.G. Lo S.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Fouillot N. Rossignol J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 14Hwang W.L. Su T.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The downstream position of the P ORF on the pgRNA, the suboptimal Kozak context (17Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the DHBV P AUG (UAUAUGG), and the presence of 15 AUG codons between the mRNA cap and the P AUG (four of which are in identical or equivalent Kozak contexts to the P AUG) lead to the prediction that P would be translated a great deal less frequently than C. To test this prediction, LMH cells were transfected with a wild-type DHBV expression vector (D1.5G) and labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 1.5 or 4 h prior to lysis at 1 or 3 days after transfection. P and C were immunoprecipitated from equal fractions of the lysates, and radioactivity incorporated into the proteins was measured by PhosphorImager analysis of the gels exposed simultaneously to the same plate. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2. The total amounts of P and C synthesized during the labeling period were calculated from the radioactivity immunoprecipitated, the labeling time, the half-life of P (25.3 min for day 1 or 15.2 min for day 3; Table I), and the numbers of methionine and cysteine residues in P and C. Dividing the total amount of P by the total amount of C yielded a molar P/C translation ratio of 0.10 ± 0.020 at day 1 and 0.11 ± 0.001 at day 3 (Table II). A measure of the validity of this approach is that it should be insensitive to the length of the labeling period, and indeed, the values for the day 1 P/C ratio in Table II reveal little difference when the labeling time was 1.5 or 4 h. Therefore, P is translated only 10-fold less rapidly than C, despite the downstream location of the P ORF on the bicistronic mRNA, the suboptimal Kozak context of the P AUG, and the presence of 15 other AUGs upstream of the P AUG.Table IIMolar P/C translation ratesExperimentLabeling timeP/C ratio2-aThe ratio was calculated employing a halflife for P of 25.3 minutes on day 1 and 15.2 minutes on day 3 (Table I).Day 1Day 3h11.50.0980.11021.50.0820.113340.089ND2-bNot determined.440.14ND2-bNot determined.Average0.10 ± 0.0200.11 ± 0.0012-a The ratio was calculated employing a halflife for P of 25.3 minutes on day 1 and 15.2 minutes on day 3 (Table I).2-b Not determined. Open table in a new tab The level of nonencapsidated P in cells exceeds the amount of encapsidated P by 3-fold at day 3 after transfection (19Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because encapsidation greatly stabilizes P, this implies that very few P molecules are encapsidated. We tested this hypothesis by examining the decay kinetics of P using mutations to DHBV that blocked encapsidation. The disappearance of P in pulse-chase experiments measured by immunoprecipitation could occur by either encapsidation or degradation. If the rates of encapsidation and degradation are appreciably different, and if both processes affect significant fractions of P, then the decay curve of nonencapsidated P would be biphasic. To determine whether disappearance of nonencapsidated P is monophasic or biphasic, LMH cells were transfected with DHBV or core-deleted DHBV (DHBV(dlCore)) expression constructs, the cultures were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min, and pulse-chase experiments were performed with time points as close as 4 min apart. Representative half-life experiments are shown in Fig. 3. The decay profile for nonencapsidated P was monophasic when P was expressed from the wild-type genome on day 1 after transfection, shortly after encapsidation begins (Fig. 3 A; linear correlation coefficient of 0.973). The decay profile for nonencapsidated P from the wild-type genome was also linear at day 3 after transfection, when the encapsidation reaction is well established (Fig. 3 B; linear correlation coefficient 0.979). Next, we measured the decay profile of nonencapsidated P expressed from DHBV(dlCore), where encapsidation is blocked because C is not produced. The decay profile at day 3 after transfection for nonencapsidated P expressed from DHBV(dlCore) was also linear (Fig. 3 C; linear correlation coefficient 0.980). These data indicate that the decay of nonencapsidated P is monophasic and that the turnover rates of P are the same from wild-type and encapsidation-defective DHBV. Therefore, the fraction of P molecules that becomes encapsidated is too small to affect the decay kinetics of P. These data reveal that the kinetic mechanism for the accumulation of excess P is rapid translation coupled with inefficient encapsidation and that the steady-state level of P in the cells is limited by the short half-life of P. These experiments are the first to analyze P in the context of active reverse transcription because previous quantitative analyses of the synthesis or degradation of P relied onin vitro systems or employed replication-deficient constructs in which P was replaced by a marker gene (11Ou J.H.

DHBV P was translated from the pgRNA at 10% the rate of C (i.e. P/C = 0.1). This relatively high rate is similar to the P/C rate of 0.25–0.33 that was determined using a P-LacZ fusion gene initiating at the P AUG (23Chang L.J. Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5158-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The P/C translation rate for HBV has been measured at 0.1 by employing a reporter gene for HBV P (24Hwang W.L. Su T.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2181-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), indicating that rapid synthesis of P is probably conserved between the avian and mammalian hepadnaviruses. The unusually high translation rate of P and the overlap between the P and C ORFs raises the possibility that translation of the P and C ORFs could interfere with each other. Given that the P AUG is probably located by the ribosomes through an unusual mechanism (14Hwang W.L. Su T.S. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Fouillot N. Tlouzeau S. Rossignol J.M. Jean-Jean O. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 4886-4895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we suspect the pgRNA may be segregated into two translational pools. One of these pools would produce C, and the other would produce P. Because encapsidation appears to occur in cis (i.e. P binds to the same mRNA molecule from which it was translated (6Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D. Nature. 1990; 344: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar)), this implies that those pgRNA molecules that produce C would not be encapsidated. Three observations indicate that the proportion of P molecules that become encapsidated is very small. First, blocking encapsidation did not affect the decay profile of P or the intracellular accumulation of P (Fig. 3), and thus the proportion of P that was encapsidated must be much smaller than the proportion that was not encapsidated. Although we cannot directly determine the level of encapsidation that would be required to leave a mark on the decay pattern of nonencapsidated P, we estimate that the sensitivity limit of these assays would be about 10–20% of the total P synthesized. Second, we previously demonstrated that the amount of nonencapsidated P exceeds the amount of encapsidated P in cells by 3-fold at day 3 after transfection (19Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Here, we found that nonencapsidated P has a half-life of only 15 min, whereas encapsidated P must be as stable as the core particle, which has a half-life of many hours to days. This indicates that the fraction of P molecules that are encapsidated must be considerably below the 10–20% estimated detection limit of our kinetic assays. Third, much more P was made than the minimum needed to assemble core particles. At day 3 after transfection in LMH cells (when encapsidation is well established), P is synthesized 10% as rapidly as C. However, core particles contain 240 C molecules (8Crowther R.A. Kiselev N.A. Bottcher B. Berriman J.A. Borisova G.P. Ose V. Pumpens P. Cell. 1994; 77: 943-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 9Bottcher B. Wynne S.A. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 88-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and 1–2 P molecules (18Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), so the P translation rate was 12–24-fold higher than the minimum required to supply P for core particles. The kinetic mechanism for the metabolism of P is in Fig. 4. In this mechanism, newly synthesized P (PNew) is made from amino acids. PNew can either be encapsidated (PE) or interact with cellular components as nonencapsidated P (PNE). Secretion of capsids containing PE results in viral P (PVirus). The rates important to the data presented here are the translation rate of P (K Synth), the encapsidation rate (K Encap), the rate of production of the cell-associated PNE (K NE), and the degradation rate of PNE (K Deg). This mechanism shows that at steady-state K NE =K Deg and that K NE andK Encap are in competition with each other. Our results indicate that K Synth is unanticipatedly large, thatK NE≫K Encap, and thatK Deg is large and monophasic. The half-life of P drops from 25.3 ± 4.0 min at day 1 after transfection to 15.2 ± 1.5 min on day 3 after transfection (TableI). Because the half-life of a protein is inversely proportional to its degradation rate, this 40% reduction in the stability of P implies that degradation of P is regulated. The reduction in stability of P is independent of the encapsidation reaction (Table I), indicating that the destabilization of P is not controlled by the level of encapsidation. The mechanism for the turnover of P is unknown, but it may involve the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway because addition of the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 increases the steady-state level of P in cells 2–3-fold (data not shown). These data disprove the accepted model that slow translation of P is limiting for encapsidation (18Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Because encapsidation requires binding of P to ε on the pgRNA (5Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hirsch R.C. Lavine J.E. Chang L.J. Varmus H.E. Ganem D.

EMBO Journal. 1990; 9: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), our data imply either that the intracellular concentration of P and the pgRNA combined with the P:ε binding constant do not favor P:ε binding or that only a small amount of P ever binds to the cellular chaperones that are needed for P to bind to ε (29Hu J. Toft D.O. Seeger C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 30Hu J. Seeger C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The large amount of cytoplasmic P must be the source of antigen resulting in the strong and early immune response to P, which can be as rapid and strong as the response to C, a major viral structural protein (32Kann M. Kochel H.G., Uy, A. Thomssen R. J. Med. Virol. 1993; 40: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 33Weimer T. Schoedel F. Jung M.C. Pape G.R. Alberti A. Fattovich G.

Med. 1995; 181: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Production of this excess of P is a liability to the virus through induction of additional immune pressure. The hepadnaviral replication strategy is to establish a persistent infection lasting decades, and the presence of an avoidable liability such as production of a large excess of P implies that the nonencapsidated P may be important for the virus. We have speculated that P may play a regulatory role on cellular or viral functions in addition to synthesizing the viral genome (19Yao E. Gong Y. Chen N. Tavis J.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8648-8657Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These results support this hypothesis by demonstrating that P is primarily a cytoplasmic protein that is only occasionally encapsidated.

The present study aims at investigating the anomeric specificity of such a positive cooperativity. The α-anomer ofd-glucose was found to increase much more markedly than β-d-glucose the phosphorylation of d-fructose by human liver glucokinase. Such an anomeric preference diminished at high concentrations of the d-glucose anomers,i.e. when the effect of the aldohexose upond-fructose phosphorylation became progressively less marked. A comparison between the effects of the two anomers ofd-glucose and those of equilibrated d-glucose upon d-fructose phosphorylation by human liver glucokinase indicated that the results obtained with the equilibrated aldohexose were not significantly different from those expected from the combined effects of each anomers of d-glucose. In isolated rat islets incubated for 60 min at 4 °C, α-d-glucose (5.6 mm), but not β-d-glucose (also 5.6 mm), augmented significantly the conversion ofd-[U-14C]fructose (5.0 mm) to acidic radioactive metabolites. Likewise, in islets prelabeled with45Ca and perifused at 37 °C, d-fructose (20.0 mm) augmented 45Ca efflux and provoked a biphasic stimulation of insulin release from islets exposed to α-d-glucose (5.6 mm), while inhibiting45Ca efflux and causing only a sluggish and modest increase in insulin output from islets exposed to β-d-glucose (also 5.6 mm). The enhancing action ofd-glucose upon d-fructose phosphorylation by glucokinase thus displays an obvious anomeric preference for α-d-glucose, and such an anomeric specificity remains operative in intact pancreatic islets. d-Glucose was recently reported to stimulate d-fructose phosphorylation by human B-cell glucokinase.

Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the apparent K m for the ketohexose being close to 160 mm (15Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1312: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present data extend to human liver glucokinase the knowledge thatd-glucose stimulates the phosphorylation ofd-fructose, as previously documented in the case of human B-cell glucokinase (1Scruel O. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 175: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 2Moukil M.A. Van Schaftingen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3872-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Such a stimulation is much more marked in the case of α-d-glucose than β-d-glucose. This anomeric specificity disappeared, however, at high concentrations of the d-glucose anomers, i.e. when the glucose-induced increase in d-fructose phosphorylation became itself progressively less marked. The metabolic data collected from islets incubated for 60 min at 4 °C are compatible with the view that the anomeric specificity of the enhancing action of d-glucose upond-fructose phosphorylation, as documented in the experiments conducted in the presence of human liver glucokinase, is also operative in intact pancreatic islets. More convincingly, the present results indicate that the effect of d-fructose upon both 45Ca efflux and insulin release from prelabeled and perifused islets is different at 37 °C in the islets exposed to α-d-glucose versus β-d-glucose. In this respect, the cationic and secretory response tod-fructose recorded in islets exposed to α-d-glucose are comparable to those otherwise observed when the concentration of d-glucose is raised from a level close to the threshold value for stimulation of insulin release (i.e. close to 5 mm) to a much higher concentration. They indeed consisted in an increase in 45Ca efflux corresponding to the stimulation of40Ca2+ influx into the islets and subsequent increase in 45Ca efflux and a biphasic stimulation of insulin release. In the islets exposed to β-d-glucose, however, the prevailing cationic effect of d-fructose consisted in a decrease in 45Ca efflux, as otherwise observed in response to the administration of equilibratedd-glucose in a concentration not exceeding 7 mm(16Malaisse W.J. Lebrun P. Yaylali B. Camara J. Valverde I. Sener A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: E117-E122PubMed Google Scholar) and as attributable to the effects of the hexose upon both the sequestration of Ca2+ by intracellular organelles and Na+-Ca2+ countertransport at the level of the B-cell plasma membrane (17Gylfe E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13750-13754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Herchuelz A. Sener A. Malaisse W.J. J. Membrane Biol. 1980; 57: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This coincided with a delayed and quite modest increase in insulin output. This interpretation of the experiment results is further supported by the fact that, before introduction of d-fructose, the release of insulin was somewhat higher in the presence of α-d-glucose rather than β-d-glucose. In conclusion, therefore, the present data unambiguously document that the enhancing effect of d-glucose upond-fructose phosphorylation by glucokinase displays anomeric preference toward α-d-glucose and that such an anomeric specificity remains operative in intact rat pancreatic islets.
