https://openalex.org/W2105587896,"Cytochrome P450 2D6 is a heme-containing enzyme that is responsible for the metabolism of at least 20% of known drugs. Substrates of 2D6 typically contain a basic nitrogen and a planar aromatic ring. The crystal structure of human 2D6 has been solved and refined to 3.0Å resolution. The structure shows the characteristic P450 fold as seen in other members of the family, with the lengths and orientations of the individual secondary structural elements being very similar to those seen in 2C9. There are, however, several important differences, the most notable involving the F helix, the F-G loop, the B′helix, β sheet 4, and part of β sheet 1, all of which are situated on the distal face of the protein. The 2D6 structure has a well defined active site cavity above the heme group, containing many important residues that have been implicated in substrate recognition and binding, including Asp-301, Glu-216, Phe-483, and Phe-120. The crystal structure helps to explain how Asp-301, Glu-216, and Phe-483 can act as substrate binding residues and suggests that the role of Phe-120 is to control the orientation of the aromatic ring found in most substrates with respect to the heme. The structure has been compared with published homology models and has been used to explain much of the reported site-directed mutagenesis data and help understand the metabolism of several compounds.

The cytochromes P450 4The abbreviations used are: P450, a generic term for a cytochrome P450, with individual P450 enzymes denoted by a number/letter/number combination derived from the sequence identity; SRS, substrate recognition site; SDM, site-directed mutagenesis. constitute a superfamily of heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the metabolism of a wide variety of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. This is accomplished through the activation of molecular oxygen by the heme group, a process that involves the delivery of two electrons to the P450 system followed by cleavage of the dioxygen bond, yielding water and an activated iron-oxygen species (Compound 1), which reacts with substrates through a variety of mechanisms (1Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 611-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic species, the electron source is a single flavoprotein, the FAD/FMN-containing cytochrome P450 reductase, which binds to the largely basic proximal face of the cytochrome through a number of salt bridges. Of the known human isoforms, cytochrome P450 2D6 is responsible for the metabolism of at least 20% of known drugs (2Bertz R.J. Granneman G.R. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1997; 32: 210-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar), with only 3A4 being responsible for a higher (50%) percentage. The cDNA encoding human P450 2D6 has been characterized (3Gonzalez F.J. Skoda R.C. Kimura S. Umeno M. Zanger U.M. Nebert D.W. Gelboin H.V. Hardwick J.P. Meyer U.A. Nature. 1998; 331: 442-446Crossref Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and subsequently localized to chromosome 22 in the q13.1 region (4Gough A.C. Miles J.S. Spurr N.K. Moss J.E. Gaedigk A. Eichelbaum M. Wolf C.R. Nature. 1990; 347: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A relatively large number of genetic polymorphisms have been described for 2D6, some of which can either result in rapid or very poor metabolism. One well characterized allelic variant is responsible for a condition known as debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism (5Lennard M.S. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 67: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Meyer U.A. Skoda R.C. Zanger U.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 46: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This arises as a result of various genetic mutations and affects a significant percentage of the Caucasian population (7Daly A.K. Leathart J.B. London S.J. Idle J.R. Hum. Genet. 1995; 95: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It results in the defective metabolism of a number of important drug molecules, including debrisoquine, from which the condition got its name. The inability of patients to turn over compounds such as debrisoquine eventually leads to toxic levels of the drug in the body. Binding of any drug to these allelic 2D6 variants can cause drug-drug interactions, which can lead to severe side effects and has resulted in early termination of several candidate drugs in development, refusal of regulatory approval, severe prescribing restrictions, and withdrawal of drugs from the market. Whereas 3A4 exhibits a wide diversity in its substrate recognition, a fact that is often attributed to its large cavity size (8Smith D.A. Ackland M.J. Jones B.C. Drug Discov. Today. 1997; 2: 406-414Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar), 2D6 generally only recognizes substrates containing a (protonated) basic nitrogen and a planar aromatic ring. These features are found especially in a large number of central nervous system and cardiovascular drugs that act on the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of proteins. For this reason, 2D6 is the most widely studied isoform, both from experimental site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) studies and from computational modeling. With regard to the latter, numerous pharmacophore models have been described (9Koymans L. Vermeulen N.P. van Acker S.A. te Koppele J.M. Heykants J.J. Lavrijsen K. Meuldermans W.

Chem. 1999; 42: 4062-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), but it has become clear that no single model can account for the diversity observed in the regioselectivity of substrate metabolism. Likewise, various homology models have been constructed (10de Groot M.J. Ackland M.J. Horne V.A. Alex A.A. Jones B.C. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1515-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11de Groot M.J. Ackland M.J. Horne V.A. Alex A.A. Jones B.C. J. Med.

Broly F. Ellis S.W. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinf. 2005; 59: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the sequence identity between 2D6 and the available x-ray crystal structures used is about 40% at best for the 2C isoforms and only 18% for 3A4. Thus, the availability of a crystal structure of 2D6 was anticipated to go a long way toward explaining the effects of polymorphism and the results of SDM studies and toward answering some of the questions raised by in silico modeling work. Such improved information would in time help achieve the ultimate goals of predicting the metabolic fate of drug compounds or predicting which compounds would inhibit the cytochromes and eventually lead to improved therapeutic ligand design. Recently, the structures of a number of mammalian cytochromes have been solved by x-ray crystallography. The first of these, rabbit 2C5 (25Williams P.A. Cosme J. Sridhar V. Johnson E.F. McRee D.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), showed considerably higher homology to the human isoforms than had been found with previous bacterial enzyme structures and led quickly to a new generation of computational models (19Lewis D.F.V.

This has been followed by the reports of the crystal structures of the human 2C9 (26Williams P.A. Cosme J. Ward A. Angove H.C. Vinković D.M. Jhoti H.

Biol. 2005; 12: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) isoforms. This was made possible by truncation of the membrane-bound N-terminal domain and, in some cases, the introduction of some small mutations that helped to solubilize the protein. In recent years, we have embarked on a similar approach, and in this paper we report the x-ray crystal structure of the human cytochrome P450 2D6 at 3.0 Å resolution. The solubilizing mutations were designed using an early model that was based on homology with cytochrome P450 BM3 (32Ravichandran K.G. Boddupalli S.S. Hasermann C.A. Peterson J.A. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1993; 261: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). This new structure has already proved to be valuable in understanding the metabolism of several compounds and the effects of many SDM studies. Early Molecular Modeling of 2D6—The initial sequence alignment was carried out using PSI-BLAST (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nuc. Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) against a nonredundant protein data base comprising over 400,000 sequences. A resultant 1200-sequence multiple sequence alignment was refined using the HMMER sequence profile alignment tools (34Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and the 2D6 model was built using the homology modeling tools in ICM (35Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). Generation of 2D6 Truncates—The 2D6 truncates were generated by PCR, introducing an XbaI site at the C terminus and an NdeI site at the N terminus plus various amino acid alterations. The N-terminal primers were designed to remove the extreme N terminus, containing the putative membrane spanning region, and polyhistidine tags were added at the N- or C terminus as described. After digestion with NdeI and XbaI, the PCR products were subcloned into the pCW expression vector (36Barnes H. Arlotto M. Waterman M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5597-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by automated dideoxy-DNA sequencing. Generation of 2D6 Mutants—Mutations at residues Leu-230 and Leu-231 were introduced using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Multiple mutations were introduced in single PCRs using semirandom primers, with multiple bases inserted at exact positions during primer synthesis (e.g. the primer CTGAATGCTCTCCCCGTCMRNCTGCATATCCCAGCGCTGGCTG was used to introduce Asn, Lys, His, Gln, Arg, and Ser at residue 230). Expression of 2D6 Truncates and Mutants to Test Solubility—Initial expression trials of all 2D6 constructs were performed using the host DH10B (Invitrogen). Cultures (5-ml scale) were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin. These cultures were used as a 1% inoculum in modified Terrific broth (100 ml), supplemented with ampicillin, 1 mm thiamine, 0.5 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid, and trace element solution (37Gillam E.M.J. Baba T. Kim B.R. Ohmori S. Guengerich F.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). When the cultures reached an A600 of 0.6 at 30 °C, expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested after a further 16 h at 30 °C by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Subcellular Fractionation—Escherichia coli pellets were resuspended in TSE buffer (200 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 500 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme) and incubated on ice for 1 h. Cell pellets were recovered by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in lysis buffer (0.5 m KPi, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were lysed using sonication (four 30-s pulses with 5-min intervals at 50% of maximum power), and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was further clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLN-100 rotor. The resultant supernatant was used as the cytosolic fraction (containing “soluble” P450), and the pellet contained the membrane fraction. Expression of 2D6 at Large Scale—A shake flask containing 100 ml of LB was inoculated with a single colony taken from a fresh transformant previously plated out onto LB agar. The flask was incubated at 30 °C with constant shaking at 120 rpm for 14 h before transfer as a 2% inoculum to the final stage. The final stage consisted of 2.5 liters of MTB and 1% glycerol in a 3.6-liter laboratory scale fermenter (InforsAG, Switzerland). All media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After inoculation, the culture was grown at 30 °C with an airflow rate of 1.5 liters air/min and an agitation speed of 680 rpm until induction. Induction was at A600 0.8 with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and 0.5 mm δ-aminolevulinic acid. Following further incubation at the same conditions for 24 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. P450 concentration was determined by CO difference spectrum using whole cells. Cell Lysis—Frozen pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 μl/ml benzonase, and protease inhibitors) at 4 ml/g cell pellet. All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. The lysate was stirred for 30 min and centrifuged (5000 × g, 20 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 200 ml of Buffer A (400 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The suspension was Dounce-homogenized on ice and left to stir for 30 min before being processed twice through a high pressure (10,000 p.s.i.) disruption system (Constant Systems Ltd., Northants, UK). The lysate was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 1 h), and the supernatant was retained. Protein Purification—The protein was purified using an adaptation of a previously published method (38von Wachenfeldt C. Richardson T.H. Cosme J. Johnson E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All manipulations and purifications were carried out at 4 °C. Purification followed a three-step process: Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen, Crawley, UK), hydroxyapatite II (Bio-Rad), and size exclusion (Superose 12, GE Healthcare, Chalfont, UK). Experiments showed that the protein was 95% pure after the first two stages. All purifications were carried out using an ÄKTA Purifier 100 instrument (GE Healthcare). The cleared lysate was applied to the nitrilotriacetic acid column in buffer A, washed (5 column volumes of wash buffer 400 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm glycine, and 100 mm NaCl) and eluted using a linear gradient of 0-100% Buffer B (400 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 mm EDTA) over 10 column volumes. The P450 sample (post-Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid) was dialyzed overnight in Buffer C (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto the hydroxyapatite column. The column was washed (5 column volumes of buffer C), and the protein was eluted using a linear gradient of 0-100% Buffer D (400 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) over 10 column volumes. The P450-containing fractions (posthydroxyapatite) were pooled and concentrated using a 15 ml Amicon centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Watford, UK) to ∼1.5 ml. The concentrated sample was applied to an S12 column equilibrated with Buffer E (50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The resulting fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Cambrex, Nottingham, UK), peptide mass fingerprinting (Micromass, Manchester, UK), protein assay (Coomassie Plus; Pierce), and P450 content (CO difference assay). Carbon Monoxide Difference Assay—Concentrations of P450 were estimated spectrophotometrically using a Cary Bio 100 instrument (Varian, Crawley, UK) from the difference spectra determined for the formation of the carbon monoxide complex with the protein after reduction with sodium dithionite (39Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2379-2385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the 2D6 L230D/L231R protein was 11 nmol/mg. Activity Assays—Activity assays were performed in a 384-well microplate using an LJL Biosystems Analyst HT (Sunnyvale, CA). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 405 and 530 nm (with a 425-nm diachronic mirror). The assay was performed using adaptations of previously published methods (40Zhang Y. Pernecky S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 41Venhorst J. Onderwater R.A.C. Meerman J.H.N. Commandeur J.N.M. Vermeulen N.P.E. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2000; 28: 1524-1532PubMed Google Scholar). 0-128 μm 4-methylaminomethyl-7-methoxycoumarin (GlaxoSmithKline) was added to 10 μmol of 2D6 in the presence of 10 mmol of cumene hydroxyperoxide (as an electron donor), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mm KPi, pH 7.5, and 20% glycerol. Readings were taken every 60 s for 10 min. The 2D6 L230D/L231R metabolizes 4-methylaminomethyl-7-methoxycoumarin with a Km of 67.6 μm and a Vmax of 2.85 ± 0.25 μm/min. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the 2D6 L230D/L231R mutant construct were grown at room temperature (∼20 °C) by free interface diffusion using Topaz XRAY chips (Fluidigm). A solution of the protein at 60 mg/ml in a buffer of 50 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol was loaded into the chip along with a range of solutions based on simple dilutions with water of a solution of 2.0 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, and 0.2 m potassium sodium tartrate, with the optimum dilution centering around an ammonium sulfate concentration of 1.48-1.52 m. Following protein and reagent loading, the chip interface line was opened and allowed to remain open for the duration of the crystallization process. All chips utilized water as the hydration fluid to maintain the environment of the chip at ∼100% relative humidity, and the chips were all prehydrated for at least 24 h prior to the experiment. Crystals typically appeared after a few days and continued to grow for a further 5-10 days, usually growing out of a globular gel-like aggregate, which generally formed after about 24 h. The crystals are rectangular plates with dimensions that rarely exceed 80 × 20 × 10 μm. The crystals were harvested from the chips and stored in a solution of 1.8 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 0.2 m potassium sodium tartrate, and 20% glycerol. The crystals were mounted directly from the harvesting solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected with a MarMosaic 225 CCD detector (Mar Research) at 100 K at a wavelength of 0.9538 Å using beam line ID23-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Due to the small size of the crystals, it was necessary to use exposure times on the order of 10-20 s per 0.5° oscillation, which resulted in considerable radiation damage during the data collection. The final native data set was assembled from 114 images collected from three crystals with refined mosaicities of 0.44, 0.51, and 0.66°. The data were processed and scaled using the HKL2000 suite of programs (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The structure was solved by Molecular Replacement using PHASER (44Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) with a 2C9 crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1OG2) as a search model. The search model included all protein atoms for the 2C9 monomer from Pro-30 to Val-490 and excluded the heme group and water molecules. The sequence identity between the 2C9 and 2D6 sequences was 40.7% in a protein sequence alignment covering this region, matching 187 of 459 residues. A convincing molecular replacement solution comprising four molecules in the asymmetric unit was found showing 222 symmetry (consistent with peaks observed in the self-rotation function). The resulting set of phases was used to calculate 2Fo-Fc and Fo-Fc (where Fo represents the observed structure factor and Fc is the calculated structure factor) electron density maps. The presence of large positive peaks in positions corresponding to the heme iron atoms confirmed that the molecular replacement solution was correct. Model Building and Refinement—The crystal structure was built using multiple cycles of model building with the molecular graphics program COOT (45Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), followed by structure refinement with REFMAC (46Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Due to the limited resolution of the diffraction data, very tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed throughout the refinement. In the last cycle, these restraints were relaxed for a small number of protein residues, which appeared to exhibit some differences in conformation between the individual molecules. The last cycle of refinement also incorporated TLS parameters (47Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) to model anisotropic displacements, specifically utilizing one TLS group per molecule. This resulted in significantly better R and Rfree values (0.230 and 0.286, respectively) compared with an equivalent non-TLS refinement cycle, where R and Rfree values were 0.253 and 0.311, respectively. The final refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The final model contains 14,429 atoms and comprises four 2D6 molecules, two sulfate ions, closely involved in crystal contacts, and 11 water molecules. The protein model includes the residues 52-497 (full-length protein sequence numbering) and additionally a short stretch of the proline-rich N-terminal region (residues 34-41). Residues 229-239 of the F-G loop have been built only as alanines, since the electron density maps were insufficiently clear to unambiguously assign the correct residue side chains. In a Ramachandran plot, 84.7% of residues are in the most favored regions as defined by PROCHECK (48Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), with 12.9 and 1.6% of residues in the additionally allowed and generously allowed regions, respectively, and 0.8% in disallowed regions. The four protein molecules are related by 222 symmetry and are all essentially the same with only minor differences, the root mean square deviations between Cα atoms for all possible molecule pairs being as follows: molecules A/B, 0.10 Å; A/C, 0.14 Å; A/D, 0.14 Å; B/C, 0.12 Å; B/D, 0.13 Å; and C/D, 0.14 Å.

We show here that the product of Rv3097c (LIPY) hydrolyzed long-chain TG with high specific activity. LIPY was purified after solubilization from inclusion bodies; the enzyme displayed a Km of 7.57 mm and Vmax of 653.3 nmol/mg/min for triolein with optimal activity between pH 8.0 and pH 9.0. LIPY was inhibited by active serine-directed reagents and was inactivated at temperatures above 37 °C. Detergents above their critical micellar concentrations and divalent cations inhibited the activity of LIPY. The N-terminal half of LIPY showed sequence homology with the proline glutamic acid-polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequences protein family of M. tuberculosis. The C-terminal half of LIPY possesses amino acid domains homologous with the hormone-sensitive lipase family and the conserved active-site motif GDSAG. LIPY shows low sequence identity with the annotated lipases of M. tuberculosis and with other bacterial lipases. We demonstrate that hypoxic cultures of M. tuberculosis, which had accumulated TG, hydrolyzed the stored TG when subjected to nutrient starvation. Under such conditions, lipY was induced more than all lipases, suggesting a central role for it in the utilization of stored TG. We also show that in the lipY-deficient mutant, TG utilization was drastically decreased under nutrient-deprived condition. Thus, LIPY may be responsible for the utilization of stored TG during dormancy and reactivation of the pathogen.

Tuberculosis caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the major public health threats in the world. The emergence of multidrug-resistant strains poses serious threats to the control of this disease due to the complex nature of second line drug treatment (1.The WHO/IUATLD Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance SurveillanceAnti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance in the World: Third Global Report. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2004: 13-25Google Scholar). Upon infection, the bacterium goes through an initial replicative phase inside the alveolar macrophages, after which it enters a nonreplicative, drug-resistant state of dormancy. This state of dormancy is probably induced by the environmental stress exerted upon the pathogen by the host's immune response. The bacterium is able to survive in this dormant state for decades until the host's immune system is weakened when it reactivates and causes the infectious disease (2.Dannenberg Jr., A.M. Rook G.A.W. Bloom B.R. Tuberculosis: Pathogenesis, Protection and Control. American Society for Microbiology, Washington D. C.1994: 459-483Google Scholar). The current antimycobacterial drugs are able to kill only the actively replicating mycobacteria and do not clear the latent bacteria from the host (3.Honer zu Bentrup K. Russell D.G. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Thus, latency is a major problem in tuberculosis control. One-third of the world population is infected with the latent microorganism, and nearly 2 million deaths occur annually (4.Dye C. Scheele S. Dolin P. Pathania V. Raviglione M.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1999; 282: 677-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar, 5.World Health OrganizationGlobal Tuberculosis Control: Surveillance, Planning, Financing. World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland2005: 24Google Scholar). Individuals carrying a latent infection are estimated to harbor a 2–23% lifetime risk of reactivation (6.Zahrt T.C. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that fatty acids may be the energy source for the mycobacterium during persistence (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8.Munoz-Elias E.J. McKinney J.D. Nat.

Bacteriol. 1956; 72: 132-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the source of these fatty acids is not known. We proposed that M. tuberculosis stores energy in the form of triacylglycerol (TG) 3The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; PE-PGRS, proline glutamic acid-polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequences; ORF, open reading frame.3The abbreviations used are: TG, triacylglycerol; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; PE-PGRS, proline glutamic acid-polymorphic GC-rich repetitive sequences; ORF, open reading frame. as it prepares to go into dormancy in a fashion similar to hibernating animals and microbial spores that use TG for long-term storage of energy. Previously, we identified 15 novel triacylglycerol synthase genes belonging to a nonclassical diacylglycerol acyltransferase family in M. tuberculosis, some of which are induced under in vitro conditions simulating dormancy and cause TG accumulation inside the bacterial cell (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Utilization of the energy stored as TG requires its hydrolysis and the release of fatty acids for catabolism by β-oxidation. Although the M. tuberculosis genome contains 21 genes annotated as putative lipase/esterase genes (11.Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar) and 94 gene products would contain the α/β-hydrolase fold characteristic of lipases/esterases (12.Hotelier T. Renault L. Cousin X. Negre V. Marchot P. Chatonnet A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D145-D147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there has been no report on the identification of an enzyme possessing long-chain TG hydrolase activity from M. tuberculosis. Recently, the products of Rv1399c (LIPH) and Rv3487c (LIPF) were cloned and characterized, but no long-chain TG hydrolysis was detected (13.Canaan S. Maurin D. Chahinian H. Pouilly B. Durousseau C.

Wang H-H. Protein Expression Purif. 2005; 42: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Here we report on the screening of 21 annotated and three additional putative lipase/esterase gene products from M. tuberculosis for long-chain TG hydrolase activity and show that the newly identified Rv3097c gene product, which we named LIPY, is active as a true lipase. LIPY (PE-PGRS63), which is a member of the PE-PGRS protein family, is a lipase belonging to the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) family and hydrolyzes long-chain TG with high specific activity. We also show that lipY was up-regulated to a much higher level than the transcripts of other lipase/esterase-like genes when mycobacteria that accumulated TG during an in vitro dormancy-like state were subjected to TG utilizing conditions indicating that this lipase might play a role in the utilization of TG for survival through dormancy. We show here that the ability to hydrolyze stored TG was drastically diminished in a lipY-disrupted mutant (Δ-lipY). This is the first report on the characterization of a long-chain TG lipase from M. tuberculosis with experimental evidence for its vital physiological role and also the first report of a PE-PGRS protein showing enzymatic activity. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 25618) and Δ-lipY mutant were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 (supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80, 10% oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment, and 0.2% glycerol) and in Dubos/Tween 80/albumin medium (prepared from Dubos broth base and Dubos medium albumin as per the manufacturer's instructions). All media were purchased from Difco. Escherichia coli DH5α and BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen) used as host strains for cloning and expression experiments were grown on Luria-Bertani broth or agar, and, when required, antibiotics were added to the culture media at the following concentrations: carbenicillin or kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; hygromycin B, 150 μg/ml for E. coli or 75 μg/ml for M. tuberculosis. Other chemicals and antibiotics were from Sigma, Fisher, and Calbiochem. DNA restriction and modifying enzymes were procured from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Induction of Lipase Genes and TG Utilization in M. tuberculosis Strains under Nutrient Starvation after Hypoxic Stress—M. tuberculosis H37Rv and Δ-lipY mutant cells were grown under a hypoxic condition essentially as previously described to induce the accumulation of TG inside the mycobacterial cell (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis cells were inoculated into Middlebrook 7H9, grown aerobically at 37 °C in roller bottles to an A600 of 0.8, and were used to inoculate Dubos/Tween/albumin medium to an A600 of 0.015, grown up to an A600 of 0.06 and distributed in tubes or in single neck wolf bottles (Chemglass) with a 0.5 head space to culture volume ratio, sealed with rubber sleeve caps, and slowly stirred on a magnetic stirrer for hypoxic growth up to 12 days. Harvested cells were divided into three sets. The first set was preserved at –80 °C and was used as control (0 h). The harvested cells of the second set were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. The cells of the third set were washed, resuspended in normal 7H9/OADC/Tween (7H9) medium instead of PBS, and served as a nutrient supplemented control. These differentially treated cells were used to measure the induction of lipase gene transcripts by semiquantitative RT-PCR and to measure the utilization of stored TG. RNA isolation and semiquantitative RT-PCR were performed as described before (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), using the primers shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers used for RT-PCR analyses of transcripts of lipase genes induced in M. tuberculosisGenePrimer pairs (5′-3′)aF, forward; R, reverse.lipC (Rv0220)F: GGTAAGCACCTCAAGCCGCTCGGCR: GCGCTGAACCACTACCCGCTCCAGlipD (Rv1923)F: GGTGTTCAGCGGGCGAGCGAGTTCR: GGCGCAACCACCGTCACTCCTCAClipE (Rv3775)F: CTAGACGCCGTCACGGCAACCGGCR: ACTGGGCGCGACCAGCGGCACATClipF (Rv3487c)F: CGACGGCGCTGGGCGGGTGGTGCTR: CGCGCCACGGCTTGCGGCGCGAGGTlipG (Rv0646c)F: CTGATCATGGGCCTGGGCGCCCAGR: GGACCCGTGAGCAGCGCCAGCAGClipH (Rv1399c)F: GACCTTCACCGCGGCCGACGGTGTCR: TGCGTGCAACGCCCTCTTCAGCGCClipI (Rv1400c)F: GGGATCGAGGCCGTGCGCCAGCGGTR: GCACAACCCGTAGCGCCACCAGCCClipJ (Rv1900c)F: CGCACGGTCGAGGACACCAGCACCR: ACCCGGTAGGCGCCCAGGTTCGTClipK (Rv2385)F: GCCAGACGGGCCGTGGGGGATATGR: CCCACCTGGATCAGCGTCGGTGGClipL (Rv1497)F: CCCGTGACCAGCTCCCGCGACAAGR: GCGGAGCGCTGGCGGTGTATCTCGlipM (Rv2284)F: TGGGTGACCGGTGAGGCGTCGAGGR: AGTGCGGGCGGTCTCCTGGCTGGTlipN (Rv2970c)F: GCATGTGGACACGGCGTGTGCAGGR: AACCGGCACAGCGCGTCATGGGTGlipO (Rv1426c)F: ACCCCTGGACCGGTGCTCGAAGCGR: GGATCAGGGAGTCGTGGCGGCCGTlipP (Rv2463)F: GGACCAGCTCCATGTGCTCGCGGCR: GGGCTCGTGCGCGTCGGAGTTCAClipQ (Rv2485c)F: CCGGCGAACAGTCAGAGGCTGCCCR: GGGCGTTGGGGAGCTCAGCGTAGGlipR (Rv3084)F: CCACTGTTCGCTTCCCGCCGGCTGR: TCGTCGCCCGCGGTCTGCATGACGlipS (Rv3176c)F: CGCACCGGGCGAGCGCGCTCATCAGR: CCTCGGCGAGCCGATCGGGCTGCTClipT (Rv2045c)F: ACGGCCACCGGCATCGTTGAAGGCR: CGCTGGGCTTTCCGAGATCGCCCTGGlipU (Rv1076)F: GTGTTGCCGGCGGACGGCACTCGAR: GACGCAACGAGCGGATCGCCTCGGlipV (Rv3203)F: CCCATCGCCGCACCCGATCTGCTGGR: GCGCGGTCCCAGTCGACTGCGGATClipW (Rv0217c)F: ATCGCCGTCGTCACCCCACGACAGR: CCGCATCGCCAAGATATGCCCGCClipX (Rv1169c)F: TTTGTCACCACACGGCCCGATTCGR: GCGCGGTTGGCTAATTCGGTGAGClipY (Rv3097c)F: AGCCGCTGCCGAGGACGAGGTGTCR: CGTCCCGGCAGTGCCTCCTTCCTGlipZ (Rv1834)F: CCGAGTGTCCGGGAGTGGCGTGACR: AGCCTCGACCTGCGGGTAGTGGCCa F, forward; R, reverse. Open table in a new tab Cells from the three sets were autoclaved, and total lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v) as previously described (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The 12-day-old wild type M. tuberculosis hypoxic culture (10 ml) was also used for labeling with 1 μCi of [14C]oleic acid (specific activity, 55 Ci/mol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 1 h, and then the cells were washed with PBS before incubating in PBS for the next 6 h. Lipids were analyzed by silica gel TLC using n-hexane/diethyl ether (9:1; v/v), and the radioactivity in the silica gel corresponding to the TG band was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard). An autoradiogram of the TLC was prepared. The amount of TG was visualized by dichromate/sulfuric acid charring of the TLC plates as described before (15.Sirakova T.D. Thirumala A.K. Dubey V.S. Sprecher H. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16833-16839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The charred TLC plate was also scanned for quantification of TG accumulation by using the AlphaImager 2200 Gel Doc system (AlphaInnotech). Generation of the lipY-disrupted Mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv— The lipY gene was disrupted by allelic exchange using specialized transducing phage as described (16.Bardarov S. Bardarov Jr., S. Pavelka Jr., M.S. Sambandamurthy V. Larsen M. Tufariello J. Chan J. Hatfull G. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The disruption construct of lipY was made by sequential cloning of a 953-bp 5′-flank (consisting of the first 38 bp of lipY open reading frame (ORF) and a 915-bp sequence upstream of lipY ORF) and a 789-bp 3′-flank (consisting of last 4 bp of lipY ORF and 785 bp of sequence downstream of lipY) of lipY, on either side of res-hyg-res gene cassette in the cosmid pYUB854. The two flanks were generated by PCR amplification using M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA as template by introducing AflII and XbaI and HindIII and SpeI sites on the ends of the 5′-flanks and 3′-flanks, respectively, for directional cloning into pYUB854 (Table 2). The PacI-digested recombinant pYUB854 containing the lipY disruption construct was introduced in phasmid phAE159, and the recombinant transducing phage obtained after packaging was used to transduce M. tuberculosis. lipY disruption by allelic exchange was confirmed by PCR analyses using specific sets of primers and Southern hybridization (Table 2). Ten hygromycin-resistant clones were screened by PCR using a set of primers (Δ-F and Δ-R) designed from the deleted part of the lipY gene. The allelic exchange by double crossover was confirmed with two sets of primers, each representing a outwardly directed hyg primer (H1 and H2) and a primer (primers E and F) in the mycobacterial genome beyond the flanking gene sequences used for making the homologous arms of the disruption construct.TABLE 2PCR primers used for lipY disruption in M. tuberculosis H37RvPrimer pairSequencePrimer pairs to amplify 5′ and 3′-flanks of lipY 5′-flank A5′-GCTTAAGATGCCGTAGGACCCG-3′ B5′-GGTCTAGAGACATCACCTCCGGC-3′ 3′-flank C5′-GGAAGCTTACTCGGTATCGCCGC-3′ D5′-GGACTAGTGGTGCAAAGTCCGGG-3′Primer pair from the deleted segment Δ-F5′-GTGCAGGCATTGACAGGCGCGGCC-3′ Δ-R5′-CCAGGTCCCCACATCGAGCCACGG-3′Primer pairs to amplify genomic flanks in the mutants 5′-flank E5′-GTGACCGGGAGATCCGAGCAGAGG-3′ H15′-TGAGGCGATGGTGGTGTCGATGCT-3′ 3′-flank H25′-GGAACTGGCGCAGTTCCTCTGGGG-3′ F5′-CCAAGGGCTGGGGTGCACAACTCC-3′ Open table in a new tab DNA Isolation and Southern Blotting—Mycobacterial genomic DNA was isolated by the guanidine thiocyanate method as described (17.Derbyshire K.M. Bardarov S. Hatfull G.F. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Molecular Genetics of Mycobacteria. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2000: 93-107Google Scholar). DNA samples were digested with suitable restriction enzyme, separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran Plus; Schleicher and Schuell), and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled probes. Probe labeling and preparation were performed using Rediview [α-32P]dCTP and the Rediprime II random priming labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning and Expression of M. tuberculosis Lipase/Esterase Genes in E. coli—The 24 ORFs were amplified from the genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis H37Rv by PCR using Pfu Turbo Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and cloned into pET200 d-TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen). The directionally cloned fragments were completely sequenced to confirm the sequence integrity of each expression construct. The constructs were used to transform competent cells of E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen), and the proteins were expressed as N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins after induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside according to the manufacturer's protocols. Total cell lysates from induced cultures were prepared in 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm DTE and used for screening for TG hydrolase activity of all lip gene products. Untransformed host cell lysate was used as control. Solubilization and Purification of LIPY—In our attempts to produce soluble LIPY protein, we performed isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells at 16, 24, and 37 °C for 4 h and 12 h. Inductions were also carried out without using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in Dual Media (Zymo Research). In all cases, virtually all of the expressed protein was insoluble. To solubilize the insoluble protein, His-tagged LIPY was expressed in 500-ml cultures by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 12 h in LB broth. Total cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the pellet was solubilized in a buffer containing 1% (w/v) sodium lauroyl sarcosine, 2 mm SDS, 25 mm triethanolamine, 1.5 mm CaCl2,50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin with shaking at 330 rpm at 10 °C for 1 h. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml bed volume cobalt affinity resin (TALON; BD Biosciences). Unbound proteins and detergents were removed by washing the resin with 10 bed volumes of bind/wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl) followed by 10 bed volumes of bind/wash buffer containing 10 mm imidazole. The bound protein was eluted in 5 bed volumes of bind/wash buffer containing 150 mm imidazole followed by 5 bed volumes of bind/wash buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, and 5-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of fractions collected at each step of the solubilization and purification process were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Lipase Assays—Lipase activity was measured by the release of [14C]oleic acid from [14C]triolein (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals) using a modified method of Belfrage and Vaughan (18.Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50–100 μg of protein from total cell lysates, 0.2 μCi of [14C]triolein, 20 mm triolein, 2% gum arabic, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, in a total volume of 100 μl. Triolein was emulsified in gum arabic and aliquoted into the reaction mixture at the indicated concentrations prior to the addition of enzyme. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reaction mixture was extracted with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol/hexane (1.25:1.41:1, v/v/v) following the addition of 200 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 10.5. The radioactivity released into the upper aqueous phase was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Alternatively, the reaction mixture was acidified with 50 μl of 6 n HCl and extracted with 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The lipids in the lower organic phase were resolved on silica TLC plates developed in hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (65:35:2, v/v/v), and the radioactivity corresponding to the internal oleic acid standard was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To investigate substrate specificity, sonicated emulsions of 20 mm [14C]diolein or [14C]dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine or [14C]dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine or [14C]hexadecylpalmitate were used. To measure pH stability, the purified enzyme was preincubated in the appropriate buffer for 15 min at 24 °C prior to the assay at 37 °C for 2 h. Temperature stability was measured by preincubating purified LIPY at the indicated temperature for 15 min prior to assay at 37 °C. The effects of serine-directed reagents like diethyl-p-nitrophenyl phosphate (E-600), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, detergents like SDS, polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether (Triton X-100), polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), and various salts were determined by preincubating the purified LIPY for 15 min at 24 °C with the indicated concentration of effector prior to the assay at 37 °C for 2 h. Identification and Cloning of M. tuberculosis Lipase/Esterase Genes— M. tuberculosis probably uses fatty acids as a carbon source during its dormancy inside the host (8.Munoz-Elias E.J. McKinney J.D. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10.Segal W. Bloch H. J. Bacteriol. 1956; 72: 132-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we identified 15 triacylglycerol synthase genes in the genome of the pathogen, several of which are induced under culture conditions that lead to a dormancy-like state resulting in TG accumulation within the bacterial cell (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Utilization of stored TG would require a true lipase. However, no mycobacterial gene that encodes long chain TG hydrolase has been identified and characterized. We screened the M. tuberculosis genome for the presence of genes encoding such enzymes. The M. tuberculosis genome contains 21 ORFs annotated as putative lipase/esterase genes. We used the sequence of a putative TG lipase from M. tuberculosis strain W17 in the NCBI data base (U76006.1; accession number NCBI AAB18414) to screen the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome for homologous genes. This approach identified three additional ORFs, Rv1169c, Rv3097c, and Rv1834, that we designate as lipX, lipY, and lipZ, respectively, to be consistent with the present nomenclature of all of the other lip genes in the M. tuberculosis genome. We included these three genes along with the 21 previously annotated lip genes in our screen for genes encoding true lipases. Screening of M. tuberculosis Lipase/Esterase Gene Products for Long-chain TG Hydrolase Activity—The 24 selected M. tuberculosis ORFs encoding putative lipase/esterase proteins were expressed in E. coli, and total cell lysates were assayed for triolein hydrolase activity. Lipase activity above untransformed control was normalized for the expression level of each recombinant protein in the total cell lysate. Triolein hydrolase activity in our standard radiometric assay at pH 8.0 was by far the highest in the lysates of recombinant E. coli expressing LIPY followed by LIPC, LIPL, and LIPX that showed much lower activities followed by lysates expressing LIPK and LIPG that had even lower levels of activity. All other lip gene products showed little or no triolein hydrolase activity (Table 3).TABLE 3Long-chain TG hydrolase activity of expressed lip genesGene productTG hydrolase activity (mean ± S.D.)nmol/mg/minLIPY41.0 ± 7.3LIPC2.7 ± 0.8LIPL1.1 ± 1.0LIPX0.7 ± 0.5LIPK0.6 ± 0.4LIPG0.4 ± 0.1LIPP0.14 ± 0.06LIPE0.12 ± 0.06LIPT0.07 ± 0.02LIPW0.05 ± 0.01LIPD0.05 ± 0.01LIPJ0.04 ± 0.02LIPZ0.04 ± 0.01LIPO0.04 ± 0.01LIPQ0.03 ± 0.02LIPR0.03 ± 0.02LIPS0.02 ± 0.01LIPM0LIPF0LIPH0LIPI0LIPN0LIPU0LIPV0 Open table in a new tab Utilization of Stored TG and Induction of Lipase Genes by Starvation in M. tuberculosis Cells Grown under Hypoxic Conditions—In order to test the hypothesis that lipase(s) release fatty acids from TG stores under nutrient-deprived conditions that might be encountered during dormancy, we cultured M. tuberculosis under hypoxic conditions for 12 days, a condition that was previously shown to cause TG accumulation (7.Daniel J. Deb C. Dubey V.S. Sirakova T.D. Abomoelak B. Morbidoni H.R. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5017-5030Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), and subsequently incubated these cells in a starvation medium (PBS) to test whether the stored TG was utilized under such conditions. To label the stored TG, we incubated M. tuberculosis cells held under hypoxia for 12 days with [14C]oleic acid for 1 h, and then the labeled cells were incubated in PBS for 6 h. After incubation, about 50% of the labeled TG was utilized under nutrient-deprived conditions (Fig. 1A). Accumulation of TG during hypoxia and utilization during starvation was also clearly seen by dichromate/sulfuric acid charring of the silica gel-TLCs of the total lipids (Fig. 1B). The intensity of the TG band showed about 50% decrease after 6 h of incubation in PBS. Cells incubated in nutrient-rich medium, used as a control, did not utilize significant amounts of the stored TG (Fig. 1C). During the TG utilization conditions, the lipase genes involved in the release of fatty acids from TG would be expected to be induced. To test for this possibility, the transcript levels of all of the 24 selected ORFs were measured by semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses. The transcript level of each lip gene before starvation (0 h), after starvation (6h-PBS), and after incubation in nutrient-rich medium (6h-7H9) are expressed as a fraction of the 23 S rRNA transcript level of the same sample (Fig. 2A). Most of the lipase genes showed induction of transcript level during incubation for 6 h in PBS. The highest level of induction after 6 h of starvation was seen in the transcripts of lipY, lipE, lipC, lipZ, lipL, and lipT. Since the lip gene products manifested very different degrees of TG hydrolase activity, the possible relative contributions of the lipase genes to the hydrolysis of stored TG within the mycobacterial cell were assessed by multiplying the transcript level after 6 h of starvation with the triolein hydrolase activity of each expressed gene product. Such an analysis showed that LIPY had by far the greatest potential for hydrolyzing in vivo stores of TG in the mycobacterium under such conditions (Fig. 2B). Disruption of lipY in M. tuberculosis—LIPY showed the highest capacity to hydrolyze long chain TG among all of the probable lipase gene products of M. tuberculosis cloned and expressed in E. coli. Moreover, when the organism was subjected to a nutrient-deprived state after the cells had accumulated TG under hypoxia, lipY was found to be the most highly induced gene. These results suggested that LIPY is most likely to be the major lipase involved in the hydrolysis of the stored TG. To test for this possibility, we generated a lipY knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis (Fig. 3). lipY was disrupted by allelic exchange using specialized transducing recombinant mycob"

Accordingly, ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation are strongly activated upon viral and bacterial infections and during other stress conditions, suggesting important roles for the ISG15 system in innate immune responses. Here, we report the identification of the ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3) EFP (estrogen-responsive finger protein) as the ISG15 E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ protein. Like other known components of the protein ISGylation system (ISG15, UBE1L, UBP43, and UBC8), EFP is also an interferon-inducible protein. Expression of EFP small interfering RNA decreased the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ in the 293T cell ISGylation system as well as in MCF-7 cells upon interferon treatment. Furthermore, the ISGylation enzyme activity of EFP was RING domain-dependent. These findings indicate that EFP is an ISG15 E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ in vivo. The fact that both UBC8 and EFP are common components in the ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugation pathways suggests a mechanism whereby a limited set of enzymes accomplishes diverse post-translational modifications of their substrates in response to changes in environmental stimulations.

Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitylation is now understood to be the dominant mechanism whereby cellular proteins are marked for degradation (3.Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev.

However, unlike ubiquitin modification, the role of ISG15 modification (ISGylation) has not been clearly defined, although ISG15 has been known since 1979 (5.Farrell P.J. Broeze R.J. Lengyel P. Nature. 1979; 279: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 6.Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.-E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). ISG15 is composed of two domains, each of which bears sequence identity to ubiquitin (33 and 32% for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively) (7.Kim K.I. Zhang D.-E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The process of ISGylation is expected to be similar to that of protein ubiquitylation. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that an isopeptide bond can be formed between the C terminus of ISG15 and the lysine ϵ-amino group of the target protein (8.Zou W. Papov V. Malakhova O. Kim K.I. Dao C. Li J. Zhang D.-E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). There are a series of distinct enzymes involved in the process of protein ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation, viz. the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin carrier protein (E2), ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (E3), and the Dub deubiquitining proteases (9.Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 10.Wilkinson K.D. Cell. 2004; 119: 741-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). An E1 enzyme for ISGylation (UBE1L) has been cloned and shows high homology to the E1 enzyme UBE1 (11.Kok K. Hofstra R. Pilz A. van den Berg A. Terpstra P. Buys C.H. Carritt B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6071-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). UBE1L-deficient cells express only free ISG15 and do not show ISG15 conjugation, indicating that UBE1L is necessary for ISGylation (12.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 13.Malakhova O.A. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.-E. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). UBP43 (USP18) has been identified as a de-ISGylating isopeptidase and is highly specific in removing ISG15, but not Nedd8 and SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) from their conjugates (14.Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). UBP43 is a member of the UBP (USP) family of ubiquitin-specific proteases and contains conserved Cys and His domains, which are common in all members of this family (15.Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Based on the information on UBE1L and UBP43, it is logical to hypothesize that ISG15 E2 and E3 are also members of the ubiquitin E2 and E3 families. Recently, Kim et al. (16.Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (17.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) reported the identification of the ubiquitin E2 enzyme UBC8 (UBCH8/UbcM8) as an ISG15-conjugating enzyme. Using the small interfering RNA (siRNA) approach, both groups indicated that UBC8 is a predominant ISG15 E2 enzyme for IFN-induced protein ISGylation in HeLa cells. Interestingly, UBC8 also functions as a ubiquitin E2 enzyme (18.Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), indicating the possible cross-talk of protein ISGylation and ubiquitylation. In the ubiquitin system, the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 enzymes to target proteins is mediated by E3 enzymes, which interact with both E2 and its target proteins and function as a bridge between E2 and the target protein (19.Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). UBC8 has been shown to interact with a number of ubiquitin E3 ligases to mediate protein ubiquitylation, such as E6AP, HHARI, Parkin, cIAP, Dorfin, EFP, RLIM, and Staring (18.Kumar S. Kao W.H.

The fact that UBC8 functions as a dual E2 enzyme for both ISG15 and ubiquitin raises the possibility that some UBC8-interacting ubiquitin E3 ligases can function as the ISG15 E3 ligase, mediating the interaction between UBC8 and the ISG15 target proteins and helping in the transfer of ISG15 from UBC8 to target proteins. Here, we report that a UBC8-interacting protein, EFP (estrogen-responsive finger protein), can help in the ISG15 modification of 14-3-3σ protein both in transfection experiments and in vivo. EFP depends on its RING finger domain to support the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ. These data indicate that EFP is an ISG15 E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ. This is the first study reporting the identification of ISG15 E3 in vivo, and we provide evidence that EFP protein is a common component in the ubiquitin and ISG15 conjugation pathways. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids pCAGGS-mISG15, pCAGGS-His6-mISG15, pFLAG-CMV2-UBC8, and pCAGGS-HA-UBE1L have been described previously (16.Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). pcDNA3-UBC8 and pcDNA3-UBE1L were constructed by subcloning the cDNAs of UBC8 and UBE1L into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Human EFP cDNA (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma), generating pFLAG-CMV2-EFP, and into the pcDNA3 vector containing an N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag, generating pcDNA3-HA-EFP. 14-3-3σ cDNA (Open Biosystems) was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector, generating pFLAG-CMV2–14-3-3σ. Human HHARI cDNA (Open Biosystems) was subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector, generating pFLAG-CMV2-HHARI. pcDNA3.1(+)-FLAG-Parkin was a kind gift from Dr. Jian Feng (State University of New York, Buffalo, NY). Mammalian HA-14-3-3σ-expressing pRRS-103 constructs were from Dr. Haian Fu (Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen). For small-scale transfection, cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected using PolyFect reagent (Qiagen Inc.). For large-scale transfection, cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (27.Zhang D.-E. Hetherington C.J. Chen H.M. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. WM9 melanoma cells (kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) were cultured in the 2% tumor medium, which contains MCDB 153 (80%; Sigma) and Leibovitz L-15 medium (20%; Invitrogen) with 2% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) (28.Leaman D.W.

Human IFN-α (Roferon-A) was from Roche. Northern Blotting—Total RNA from WM9 and MCF-7 cells was isolated using RNA-Bee reagent (Tel-Test) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of total RNA from each time point was separated on a formaldehyde-agarose gel (0.22 m), blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with 32P-labeled cDNAs. Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid (Ni-NTA)-Agarose Purification—Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm imidazole. Ni-NTA-agarose beads (20 μl; Qiagen Inc.) was then added to cell extracts (500 μg) and rotated at room temperature for 4 h. Precipitates were washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 20 mm imidazole and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm dithiothreitol). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Immunocomplexes were precipitated with a mixture of protein A/G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the same buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), HA (Covance Inc., Denver, PA), Myc (Sigma), EFP (BD Biosciences), and 14-3-3σ (Upstate, Chicago, IL) were purchased from the indicated manufacturers. Mouse anti-human ISG15 monoclonal antibody (clone 5.1) was kindly provided by Dr. Ernest Borden (The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Rabbit anti-mouse ISG15 polyclonal antibody has been described previously (13.Malakhova O.A. Yan M. Malakhov M.P. Yuan Y. Ritchie K.J. Kim K.I. Peterson L.F. Shuai K. Zhang D.-E.

Western blotting was performed as described previously (29.Malakhov M.P. Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.-E. J. Biol.

RNA Interference for EFP—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER.retro.puro (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used for constructing small hairpin RNA (shRNA) for EFP. The targeted sequences for siRNA are EFP cDNA regions 1158–1176 (ggaaaagaaatccaagaaa; siRNA1) and 711–729 (ggtggagcagctacaacaa; siRNA2). The synthesized oligonucleotides for siRNA1 are 5′-Gatccccggaaaagaaatccaagaaattcaagagatttcttggatttcttttccttttta-3′ and 5′-Agcttaaaaaggaaaagaaatccaagaaatctcttgaatttcttggatttcttttccggg-3′; the synthesized oligonucleotides for siRNA2 are 5′-Gatccccggtggagcagctacaacaattcaagagattgttgtagctgctccaccttttta-3′ and 5′-Agcttaaaaaggtggagcagctacaacaatctcttgaattgttgtagctgctccaccggg-3′. The annealed oligonucleotides were digested with BglII and HindIII and inserted into the pSUPER.retro.puro vector. To test the efficiency of EFP shRNA in the cotransfection experiments, 293T cells were transfected with pSUPER-EFP shRNA and mammalian expression plasmids encoding FLAG-14-3-3σ and His-ISG15. The expression of EFP and the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ were analyzed 48 h post-transfection. To test the effect of EFP shRNA on IFN-induced 14-3-3σ ISGylation in vivo, we packaged retrovirus by cotransfection of pSUPER-EFP shRNAs with the amphotropic retroviral packaging vector pCL-10A1 into 293T cells. MCF-7 cells seeded in 6-well plates were infected with control pSUPER.retro.puro vector retrovirus or pSUPER-EFP shRNA retrovirus. Twenty-four hours post-infection, cells were selected with 6 μg/ml puromycin. Dead cells were washed out with PBS, and attached live cells were amplified, resulting in stable shRNA-expressing cell pools. MCF-7 cells and different cell pools were treated with 1000 units/ml human IFN-α. After 48 h, the expression of EFP and the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ were analyzed. EFP Is Up-regulated upon IFN Treatment—Because the primary and tertiary structures of ISG15 are similar to those of ubiquitin (30.Narasimhan J. Wang M. Fu Z. Klein J.M. Haas A.L. Kim J.-J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27356-27365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), the mechanism of ISGylation is expected to be similar to that of protein ubiquitylation and is predicted to involve the activity of the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Notably, both ISG15 expression and protein ISGylation are highly induced upon IFN stimulation. Furthermore, all known components of the protein ISGylation system (i.e. ISG15, UBE1L, UBP43, and UBC8) are IFN-inducible proteins (6.Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.-E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 31.Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Hoebe K. Yan M. Beutler B. Zhang D.-E. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that ISG15 E3 ligases are UBC8-interacting ubiquitin E3 ligases that may also be encoded by IFN-inducible genes. Based on published reports (24.Urano T. Saito T. Tsukui T. Fujita M. Hosoi T. Muramatsu M. Ouchi Y. Inoue S. Nature. 2002; 417: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 28.Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Jacobs B. Vyas K. Sun Y. Ozdemir A. Yi T. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and available information from Web sites, we identified one candidate protein (EFP) that fully matched the hypothesized criteria. In gene expression profiling studies using oligonucleotide array, Leaman et al. (28.Leaman D.W. Chawla-Sarkar M. Jacobs B. Vyas K. Sun Y. Ozdemir A. Yi T. Williams B.R. Borden E.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that EFP is one of the IFN-stimulated genes in human melanoma cell lines WM9 and WM35. To determine whether EFP mRNA is truly up-regulated by IFN treatment, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA prepared from WM9 human melanoma cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. EFP has been reported to be an estrogen-inducible gene in MCF-7 cells (32.Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Sano M. Watanabe T. Tsutsumi K. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Northern blotting showed that EFP mRNA could be up-regulated by IFN treatment at 2 h, reaching a maximum at ∼5h. EFP mRNA levels at 8 and 24 h were still higher than the basal level (Fig. 1A). ISG15 mRNA levels were also analyzed by Northern blotting as a positive control (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the induction of EFP is at the level of protein expression, Western blot analysis was performed with lysates prepared from WM9 human melanoma cells and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Immunodetection using EFP-specific antibody showed that IFN increased the protein level of EFP, reaching a maximum at ∼8 h (Fig. 1B). As a positive control, ISG15 protein was also induced by IFN treatment. The promoter regions of genes related to ISG15 modification, including ISG15, UBE1L, UBP43, and UBC8, contain the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE) (6.Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.-E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16.Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), which is responsible for promoter activation by type I IFN via its interaction with the IFN-stimulated gene factor-3 complex containing phosphorylated Stat1, Stat2, and IRF9 (33.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar, 34.Fujii Y. Shimizu T. Kusumoto M. Kyogoku Y. Taniguchi T. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5028-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, the 5′-flanking region of the human EFP gene (32.Ikeda K. Inoue S. Orimo A. Sano M. Watanabe T. Tsutsumi K. Muramatsu M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) also contains an ISRE sequence. The facts that the EFP promoter contains the ISRE sequence and that EFP protein is induced by IFN treatment support the involvement of EFP protein in IFN-stimulated ISGylation. 14-3-3σ Can Be Modified by ISG15 in the 293T Transfection System—EFP protein is a RING finger-type ubiquitin E3 ligase that directs 14-3-3σ ubiquitination and promotes 14-3-3σ proteolysis in a proteasome-dependent manner (24.Urano T. Saito T. Tsukui T. Fujita M. Hosoi T. Muramatsu M. Ouchi Y. Inoue S. Nature. 2002; 417: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). EFP can interact with UBC8 via its RING finger domain and mediates the transfer of ubiquitin from UBC8 to 14-3-3σ (24.Urano T. Saito T. Tsukui T. Fujita M. Hosoi T. Muramatsu M. Ouchi Y. Inoue S. Nature. 2002; 417: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Recently, UBC8 has been identified as an ISG15 E2-conjugating enzyme (16.Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9592-9600Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These facts support the possible role of EFP in the ISG15 modification of 14-3-3σ protein. To determine whether 14-3-3σ could be modified by ISG15, we cotransfected plasmid DNA expressing His-ISG15, UBE1L, UbcM8, and FLAG-14-3-3σ into 293T cells. His-ISG15 and covalently linked proteins were enriched by Ni-NTA pull down, and antibody against the FLAG epitope was used in Western blot analysis to detect 14-3-3σ. As shown in Fig. 2, 14-3-3σ associated with Ni-NTA resin independently of ISG15 modification. At the same time, a band that matched the molecular mass of a single ISG15-conjugated 14-3-3σ protein was detected. This band was observed in cell extracts cotransfected with 14-3-3σ and ISG15 (Fig. 2, lane 2). Expression of UBE1L and UBC8 increased the intensity of this additional band (Fig. 2, compare lanes 4 and 6 with lane 2). Cotransfection of UBE1L and UBC8 expression plasmids strongly increased the ISG15-modified form of 14-3-3σ (Fig. 2, lane 8). The total levels of 14-3-3σ protein were determined by direct Western blotting in the same set of experiments. Although the total levels of 14-3-3σ protein were quite equal, significantly higher levels of unmodified 14-3-3σ were pulled down by Ni-NTA accompanied by higher levels of ISGylated 14-3-3σ (Fig. 2, for example, lane 8). The result was very repeatable (also see Fig. 4). It is known that 14-3-3 proteins can form dimers and that 14-3-3 dimeric structure is very stable (35.Xiao B. Smerdon S.J. Jones D.H. Dodson G.G. Soneji Y. Aitken A. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It is likely that ISGylated 14-3-3σ can still form dimers with unmodified 14-3-3σ, which was also pulled down by Ni-NTA resin through the interaction with His-ISG15/14-3-3σ.FIGURE 4EFP enhances the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ. A, 293T cells were transfected with FLAG-14-3-3σ, HA-EFP, UBE1L and UBC8, and His-ISG15 expression constructs as indicated. Proteins (500 μg) were subjected to Ni-NTA pull down and Western-blotted (WB) with anti-FLAG antibody. Protein expression and protein ISGylation were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 4. B, EFP (but not Parkin and HHARI) can support 14-3-3σ ISGylation. 293T cells were transfected with HA-14-3-3σ, FLAG-EFP, FLAG-Parkin, FLAG-HHARI, and His-ISG15 expression constructs as indicated. Proteins (500 μg) were subjected to Ni-NTA pull down and Western-blotted with anti-HA antibody. The expression of these proteins via transfection was examined by Western blotting.

The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting using antibody against human ISG15 or 14-3-3σ. As shown in Fig. 3A, a species with the predicted molecular mass of 14-3-3σ modified with a single ISG15 moiety (28 + 17 kDa) was detected in the IFN-treated sample, but not in the untreated one. Notably, 14-3-3σ/ISG15 conjugation was not observed in the immunoprecipitates of the anti-mouse IgG1 control antibody. The immunoprecipitates were also detected by anti-14-3-3σ antibody (Fig. 3B). As shown in Fig. 3B, besides unmodified 14-3-3σ, an additional band was detected in the IFN-treated samples, but not in the untreated one. The size of this band corresponds to the ISG15 band detected in Fig. 3A. The molecular mass of the 14-3-3σ/ISG15 conjugate in Fig. 3 corresponds to that of the predominant 14-3-3σ species detected in the 293T ISG15-conjugating system described in Fig. 2. We could also detect the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ in IFN-treated HeLa cells and A549 cells (data not shown). EFP Promotes ISGylation of 14-3-3σ—The observation that 14-3-3σ is a target of ISG15 modification prompted us to investigate whether EFP can function as an ISG15 E3 ligase for 14-3-3σ. We first used the 293T system to examine the effect of EFP on 14-3-3σ ISGylation. FLAG-14-3-3σ was expressed in 293T cells along with the His-ISG15, UBE1L, and UBC8 expression constructs in the absence or presence of HA-EFP. The ISGylated proteins were enriched with Ni-NTA-agarose and detected by Western blotting. As described above, ISGylated 14-3-3σ was detected when it was coexpressed with His-ISG15, UBE1L, and UBC8 without the addition of HA-EFP (Fig. 4A, lane 4); however, the amount of ISGylated 14-3-3σ was dramatically increased by HA-EFP expression (lane 5). On film with longer exposure times, the ISGy-lated 14-3-3σ signal was also detected when FLAG-14-3-3σ was coexpressed with His-ISG15, and EFP expression increased this signal (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3) (data not shown). As in Fig. 2, higher levels of unmodified 14-3-3σ were pulled down by Ni-NTA accompanied by higher levels of ISGylated 14-3-3σ. The whole cell lysates were analyzed directly by Western blotting for determination of total FLAG-14-3-3σ levels and total ISG15 conjugation levels. Although EFP significantly increased the level of ISGylated 14-3-3σ, it did not enhance the total amount of protein ISGylation. To examine the specificity of EFP in supporting the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ, the roles of two other UBC8-interacting ubiquitin E3 ligases, Parkin and HHARI, were examined (20.Moynihan T.P. Ardley H.C.

Takahashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35661-35664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression of only EFP (lane 4), but not Parkin or HHARI (lanes 6 and 8), resulted in increased accumulation of ISGylated 14-3-3σ, demonstrating the specificity of EFP in supporting 14–3-4σ ISGylation. siRNA for EFP Decreases the IFN-induced ISGylation of 14-3-3σ—After showing that EFP supports 14-3-3σ ISGylation in 293T cell transfection assays, we further tested whether EFP depletion in vivo would cause a decrease in 14-3-3σ ISGylation in IFN-treated cells. We reduced cellular EFP expression through the siRNA approach using a retroviral expression vector (pSUPER-EFP1 or pSUPER-EFP2) (36.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether these siRNA constructs could decrease the expression of EFP and the ISGylation of 14-3-3σ in 293T cells. Plasmids for His-ISG15 and FLAG-14-3-3σ were transfected into 293T cells with increasing amounts of a mixture of pSUPER-EFP1 and pSUPER-EFP2. Cotransfection of EFP siRNA constructs reduced the levels of EFP protein and 14-3-3σ ISGylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). To investigate the effects of EFP siRNA on IFN-induced ISGylation of endogenous 14-3-3σ, MCF-7 cells were infected with pSUPER-EFP1 and pSUPER-EFP2 retroviruses that also express the puromycin selection marker. After puromycin selection, the dead cells were washed out with PBS, and attached live cells were amplified, resulting in stable shRNA-expressing cell pools. The levels of EFP and 14-3-3 proteins were examined. As shown in Fig. 5B, the EFP protein level was strongly inhibited by pSUPER-EFP2 shRNA expression and weakly inhibited by pSUPER-EFP1 shRNA expression in untreated cells. After interferon treatment, the protein level of EFP was up-regulated, and the EFP expression was"

We report that human peptidoglycan recognition proteins 3 and 4 (PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4) are secreted as 89-115-kDa disulfide-linked homo- and heterodimers and are bactericidal against several pathogenic and nonpathogenic transient, but not normal flora, Gram-positive bacteria.

PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 are also active in vivo and protect mice against experimental lung infection. In contrast to antimicrobial peptides, PGLYRPs kill bacteria by interacting with their cell wall peptidoglycan, rather than permeabilizing their membranes. PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 are expressed in the skin, eyes, salivary glands, throat, tongue, esophagus, stomach, and intestine. Thus, we have identified the function of mammalian PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4, and show that they are a new class of bactericidal and bacteriostatic proteins that have different structures, mechanism of actions, and expression patterns than antimicrobial peptides.

Mammalian PGLYRPs were initially thought of as pattern recognition receptors similar to insect PGRPs (18Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol.

Because the function of mammalian PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 has been unknown, here we have identified their function by testing the hypothesis that human PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 (and also PGLYRP1) have bactericidal activity and are expressed in tissues that come in contact with the external environment. PGLYRPs—Blasticidin-resistant stable transfectants of Drosophila S2 cells expressing human PGLYRP1, PGLYRP3, and PGLYRP4 (Gen-Bank™ accession numbers AF076483, AY035376, and AY035377), or both PGLYRP3 and PGLYRP4 (PGLYRP3:4) in an inducible pMT/BiP/V5-His vector (Invitrogen) were generated and integration of the constructs into host cell genome was confirmed by PCR. The transfectants were grown in serum-free medium (Drosophila SFM, Invitrogen) and expression of PGLYRPs was induced with 500 μm CuSO4. All PGLYRP proteins were secreted and purified from culture supernatants by nickel-agarose (His-Bind Kit, Novagen) affinity chromatography under native conditions as recommended by the manufacturer following dialysis of the supernatants against binding buffer, except that all buffers included 4 mm CaCl2 and 10% glycerol, and elution was done with 300 mm imidazole. PGLYRP-containing fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 10% glycerol. The proteins were kept at -80 °C and their purity is shown in Fig. 1, A and B. For Ca2+ removal, proteins were treated with 8 mm EGTA for 10 min at 20 °C and dialyzed against the above buffer without CaCl2 or mocktreated and dialyzed with CaCl2. De-glycosylation was performed with 0.15 units of N-glycosidase/μg of protein (glycopeptidase F from Flavobacterium meningosepticum, Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C. Human PGLYRP1, PGLYRP2, PGLYRP3, and PGLYRP4 in pcDNA3.1 vector were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (35Wang Z.-M. Li X. Cocklin R.R. Wang M. Wang M. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Gupta D.

PGLYRPs were also subcloned into the inducible pET-32 bacterial expression vector with N-terminal thioredoxin, His6, and S tags (Novagen), and recombinant PGLYRP proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, which were isolated using the BugBuster kit (Novagen) and differential centrifugation as recommended by the manufacturer. The inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 m urea and recombinant proteins were purified by nickel-agarose (His-Bind Kit, Novagen) in 6 m urea as recommended by the manufacturer. The purification yielded single bands on Coomassie Blue-stained gels that corresponded to the bands detected on Western blots with anti-tag antibodies and were used to confirm the specificity of anti-PGLYRP antibodies (in addition to PGLYRPs expressed in S2 cells, Fig. 1C). Antimicrobial Assays—Microbicidal activity of PGLYRPs (purified from S2 cell supernatants), magainin ([Ala8,13,18]magainin II amide, from Sigma) (37Chen H.-C. Brown J.H. Morell J.L. Huang C.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 462-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), lysostaphin (recombinant, from Sigma), or penicillin G (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) were tested in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.6, with 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 5% glycerol, on exponentially growing Bacillus licheniformis (ATCC 9789), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), Staphylococcus aureus (clinical isolate Rb) (38Zeiger A.R. Wong W. Chatterjee A.N. Young F.E. Tuazon C.U. Infect. Immun. 1982; 37: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19115), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4698), E. coli K12, Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 13315), and Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 13047) all supplemented with 1% LB, Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 49399), Streptococcus agalactiae (ATCC 13813), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 19433) supplemented with 1% BHI broth, Lactobacillus acidophilus (ATCC 4356) supplemented with 1% Lactobacillus broth (Difco), Candida albicans (ATCC 18804) supplemented with 1% YPD broth, or Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633) supplemented with 50% Schaeffer medium with 0.5 g/liter of NH4Cl and 2 g/liter of glucose (39Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Microorganisms, at 0.5 to 2.5 × 106/ml (25 × 106/ml in experiments on membrane permeabilization), were incubated with PGLYRPs or bovine serum albumin (Sigma, or recombinant human IgG1 Fc fragment, expressed in S2 cells, with similar results, not shown) as a control, at the concentrations and the lengths of time indicated under “Results,” at 37 °C with shaking. The samples were diluted in 0.9% NaCl and plated on LB, BHI, or YPD agar plates for colony counts. For inhibition of killing, PGLYRPs were incubated with 200 μg/ml of B. subtilis or S. aureus peptidoglycan (40Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41Dziarski R. Gupta D. Infect.

Spheroplasts were obtained by treatment of 2-25 × 106/ml S. aureus with 10 μg/ml lysostaphin or B. subtilis with 10 μg/ml of lysozyme (hen egg from Sigma) and 10 μg/ml of muramidase (mutanolysin from Sigma) in “protoplast” medium (Schaeffer medium with 0.75 m sucrose) at 37 °C, and viability was determined by overlaying bacteria in 0.7% agar onto 1.5% agar plates, both in CYS medium with 0.5 m sucrose (42Gotz F. Ahrne S. Lindberg M. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 74-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Jackobson E.D. Landman O.E. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 445-458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness and kinetics of S. aureus and B. subtilis spheroplast formation by treatment with lysostaphin or lysozyme plus mutanolysin, respectively, was confirmed by phase-contrast microscopy and by demonstrating a decrease in optical density at 660 and 540 nm. Besides S. aureus Rb, the following additional S. aureus strains were used: Smith (highly virulent encapsulated, ATCC 13709), MRSA Kansas (methicillin-resistant clinical isolate, ATCC 43300), MRSA Spain (methicillin-resistant clinical isolate, ATCC BAA-42), Seattle 1945 (antibiotic-sensitive clinical isolate, ATCC 2593), Wood 46 (high producer of α-toxin, ATCC 10832), and 3528 (laboratory strain from Glaxo Laboratories). We performed several controls to assure that the assay for bacterial killing by colony counts accurately measured the killing of bacteria, rather than PGLYRP-mediated bacterial aggregation: (a) we did not see any significant bacterial agglutination by microscopy at the concentrations of bacteria and PGLYRPs that were used in the killing assays; (b) agglutination is concentration-dependent and usually occurs only at equivalent ratios of bacteria to agglutinins, and is not prominent at excessive concentrations of either agglutinins or bacteria; however, killing of bacteria by PGLYRPs was similar at a wide range (1000-fold) of bacterial concentrations; (c) breaking any potential aggregates by high speed vortexing or gentle sonication did not change the results; and (d) bacteria could be rescued from killing by PGLYRPs by diluting into a medium with 0.75 m sucrose and plating into semisolid agar, if there was just aggregation of bacteria, the aggregates would stay in the agar and there would be no prevention of killing. Bacterial aggregation was also not responsible for the lower bacterial counts recovered from the lungs in in vivo experiments, because bacterial counts in the homogenized nasal tissues were not significantly different in PGLYRP3-treated and untreated mice 1 h after infection. The V5-His tag also had no influence on bacterial killing, because PGLYRP1 with the V5-His tag (purified on nickel-agarose) and PGLYRP1-Fc fusion protein without the V5-His tag (human IgG1 Fc fragment fused to the C-terminal of PGLYRP1, and purified from culture supernatants of S2 stable transfectants on protein A-agarose) both had the same bactericidal activity (not shown). Intranasal Lung Infection—Female BALB/c mice (6/group), 6-8 weeks old (from Harlan Sprague-Dawley), were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, 4.5 μg of PGLYRP3, PGLYRP4, heat-inactivated (100 °C, 5 min) PGLYRP3, or recombinant Fc IgG fragment in 15 μl or buffer alone was instilled intranasally, 15 min later the mice were challenged intranasally with 3 × 108 S. aureus in 10 μl of saline, and at 4 h postchallenge of the numbers of S. aureus in homogenized lungs were determined by colony counts. The results were expressed as geometric means and the significance of the difference between PGLYRP-treated and buffer-treated groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney U test. The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee. Membrane Permeabilization—Membrane permeabilization was studied using the membrane-nonpermeable DNA-binding fluorescent dye SYTOX-Green (2 μm, Molecular Probes) (44Nekhotiaeva N. Elmquist A. Rajarao G.K. Hallbrink M. Langel U. Good L. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 394-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and 25 × 106/ml of bacteria in Schaeffer medium (39Schaeffer P. Millet J. Aubert J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 704-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) without or with 0.75 m sucrose (42Gotz F. Ahrne S. Lindberg M. J.

Antibodies—Anti-PGLYRP antibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to the following amino acids: CLDPQHPVMPRKV for PGLYRP3, and CSQRLRELQAHHVHNNSG for PGLYRP4, coupled to KLH, followed by affinity purification on SulfoLink gel (Pierce) with corresponding peptides linked through the N-terminal Cys, elution with Tris glycine buffer, pH 2.5, and dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The antibodies were specific for each PGLYRP, as demonstrated by their reactivity on Western blots with only one PGLYRP from which the peptide was derived, and no reactivity with the other PGLYRPs (Fig. 1C). An antibody to a different peptide, which did not react with human PGLYRP3 or PGLYRP4, prepared and purified by the same method, was used as a negative control. V5 mouse monoclonal antibody was from Invitrogen and peroxidaselabeled S-protein from Novagen. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin 5-μm sections of skin, eye, submandibular salivary gland, parotid salivary gland, throat, tongue, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon, from normal human donors (male and female, 21-65 years old), were prepared by BioChain. Following standard deparaffinization, re-hydration, and quenching of endogenous peroxidase by 30 min incubation in 0.3% H2O2, the slides were incubated with 0.6-1.2 μg/ml of anti-PGLYRP3, anti-PGLYRP4, or control antibody (obtained and tested for specificity as described above) overnight, followed by biotinylated second antibody and Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a substrate (which generates a brown reaction product) and counterstaining with hematoxylin (blue). Lysozyme was detected in the intestine as described (45Erlandsen S.L. Parsons J.A. Taylor T.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) using the Vectastain ABC kit. RNA, Real-time RT-PCR, and Northern Blots—RNA from normal human liver, skin, esophagus, and tongue were obtained from Clontech and Stratagene. Corneas were isolated from normal human eyes preserved in RNAlater (Ambion), and obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange or Central Florida Lions Eye and Tissue Bank. RNA was extracted from cornea or cultured cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was done using TaqMan reagents and the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System as recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). Briefly, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems) and random hexamers (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by reverse transcription for 60 min at 37 °C, and inactivation for 5 min at 95 °C. The comparative CT method was used with 18 S RNA as an endogenous control. Each sample was assayed in duplicate with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), primer concentrations of 0.6 μm (experimental) and 0.2 μm (18 S), and 0.1 μm probe concentrations. The cycling conditions were: uracil-DNA glycosylase incubation at 50 °C for 2 min, AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase activation at 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 two-step cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Each experiment (including reverse transcription) was repeated at least three times. The forward and reverse primers and the probes were as follows: PGLYRP1, GCAGCACTACCACATGAAGACACT, CGAGCCCGTCTTCTCCAAT, CTGGTGCGACGTGGGCTACAACTTC; PGLYRP2, CTGGATCCTACTCGGATTGCTACT, GCAGAAGCTGTGTGTCTGGTCTT, CCTGGCTGAGCTGGAGCAGAAAGTG; PGLYRP3, ACCTGCCTGGACCCTCAAC, CCAAGCAGATCGTTTGATGATG, TGCCCAGGAAGGTTTGCCCCA; PGLYRP4, TCCAGTTATGTTCAGCCACTTCTT, AAGCCTTCTTCAGGCTTGTCTTC, AGAACTGCCTGGCCCCTCGGC; and 18 S, GCCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG, CATTCTTGGCAAATGCTTTCG, ACCGGCGCAAGACGGACCAG. Northern blots were done as described (18Liu C. Xu Z. Gupta D. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34686-34694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: 10 μg of RNA/lane was used, the probes were the following fragments amplified with the following primers: PGLYRP2 forward, ACAATGGCCCAGGGTGTCCTCT and reverse, GTACCCCTCAACCACGGCACAC; PGLYRP3 forward, GTCCCAGCCCTGCTGCCTTATC and reverse, CCTGGGGAGGAGGTGGCTCTTA; PGLYRP4 forward, TCCAGAAGGGCCACCTGTCATC and reverse, GACAAGGTTCGGGCCACATCAC; and the β-actin probe was from Clontech. The purified fragments were labeled with 32P using the RadPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen). Keratinocytes and Other Cells—Human epidermal keratinocytes, isolated from neonatal foreskin, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (both from Cascade Biologics) were grown in EpiLife medium with Human Keratinocyte Growth Supplement or Medium 200 with Low Serum Growth Supplement, respectively (Cascade Biologics), and used between the 3rd and 5th passage. Before each experiment, the cells were maintained in medium without the supplement for 18-24 h. The human U373 astrocytoma cell line was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone). Human peripheral blood monocytes from normal healthy donors were obtained and cultured as described previously (46Wang Z.-M. Liu C. Dziarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20260-20267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated for 4 h with 2 × 108/ml of heat-killed (70 °C, 30 min) B. subtilis or E. cloacae. Other Methods—Soluble S. aureus peptidoglycan or insoluble S. aureus or B. subtilis peptidoglycan, S. aureus wall teichoic acid, and E. faecalis lipoteichoic acid (LTA) were purified as described (40Rosenthal R.S. Dziarski R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 253-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 41Dziarski R. Gupta D. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 5212-5216Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar).

ReLPS (LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re mutant), dextran sulfate (Mr 50,000), poly(IC), β-glucan (laminarin from Laminaria digitata), mannan, protein A, protein G, and microgranular cellulose were from Sigma. Assays for hydrolysis of soluble and insoluble S. aureus and B. subtilis peptidoglycans and heat-killed S. aureus and B. subtilis bacteria by PGLYRPs were performed as described (35Wang Z.-M. Li X.

https://openalex.org/W2126698884,"The “classical” organic anion secretory pathway of the renal proximal tubule is critical for the renal excretion of the prototypic organic anion, para-aminohippurate, as well as of a large number of commonly prescribed drugs among other significant substrates. Organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1), originally identified as NKT (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J. G., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997) J. Biol.

However, several other transporters (e.g. OAT2, OAT3, and MRP1) have also been proposed as important PAH transporters on the basis of in vitro studies; therefore, the relative contribution of OAT1 has remained unclear. We have now generated a colony of OAT1 knock-out mice, permitting elucidation of the role of OAT1 in the context of these other potentially functionally redundant transporters. We find that the knock-out mice manifest a profound loss of organic anion transport (e.g. para-aminohippurate) both ex vivo (in isolated renal slices) as well as in vivo (as indicated by loss of renal secretion). In the case of the organic anion, furosemide, loss of renal secretion in the knock-out results in impaired diuretic responsiveness to this drug. These results indicate a critical role for OAT1 in the functioning of the classical pathway. In addition, we have determined the levels of ∼60 endogenous organic anions in the plasma and urine of wild-type and knock-out mice. This has led to identification of several compounds with significantly higher plasma concentrations and/or lower urinary concentrations in knock-out mice, suggesting the involvement of OAT1 in their renal secretion. We have also demonstrated in xenopus oocytes that some of these compounds interact with OAT1 in vitro. Thus, these latter compounds might represent physiological substrates of OAT1.

OAT1 (organic anion transporter 1) is the prototypic member of a family of phylogenetically related transmembrane proteins principally expressed in barrier epithelia, such as renal tubules. We originally cloned murine OAT1, initially termed NKT (for novel kidney transporter) (1Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J.G. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol.

We found OAT1/NKT to be almost exclusively expressed in the kidney by Northern blotting, and in situ hybridization showed that the most intense signal was present in kidney cortex, following a pattern characteristic of proximal tubule localization. Taken together with the finding that the gene manifested significant sequence homology to the previously described organic cation transporter, OCT1 (5Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), we postulated its role as an organic ion transporter. Subsequently, the rat ortholog was cloned and demonstrated to indeed function as an organic anion transporter when heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes (6Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M.

The proximal tubule of the mammalian kidney contains a highly potent system for the secretion of organic anions; many of its substrates are cleared upon the “first pass” of the circulation through the kidney. Basolateral uptake, the driving force for this secretion, operates by coupling the entry of substrate to the exit of dicarboxylates (particularly α-ketoglutarate) along their concentration gradient. Dicarboxylates are maintained at high intracellular concentrations through the action of a Na+-dicarboxylate cotransporter, in turn driven by the Na+ gradient. The overall process is accordingly referred to as tertiary active transport. This “classical” organic anion transport pathway is responsible for the tubular secretion (and therefore renal excretion), and sometimes nephrotoxicity, of a strikingly diverse array of important pharmaceuticals and other xenobiotics, as well as, potentially, endogenous organic anions (23Dantzler W.H.

Notable among its substrates are β-lactam antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 4The abbreviations used are: NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PAH, para-aminohippurate; ES, estrone sulfate; FL, fluorescein; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; T/M, ratio of concentration in tissue to concentration in medium. 4The abbreviations used are: NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; PAH, para-aminohippurate; ES, estrone sulfate; FL, fluorescein; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; T/M, ratio of concentration in tissue to concentration in medium. antivirals, and loop and thiazide diuretics; the latter largely utilize this pathway to gain access to their site of action in the lumen of the distal nephron (25Beermann B.

OAT1 has been demonstrated to mediate the transport of many of these same compounds when heterologously expressed (e.g. following microinjection of OAT1 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes or transfection of OAT1 cDNA into epithelial cell lines), including of the prototypical substrate of the classical pathway, para-aminohippurate (PAH) (reviewed in Refs. 28Burckhardt B.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and has been immunolocalized to the basolateral surface of the proximal tubule (31Motohashi H.

Thus, OAT1 manifests physiological properties consistent with a role in the basolateral uptake step of organic anion secretion by the classical pathway. However, functional data on OAT1 have derived mainly from in vitro studies, and the actual activity of OAT1 in vivo, in the context of the whole kidney and/or the entire organism, might be quite different. Moreover, several other transporters have also been proposed to mediate PAH/organic anion secretion in the proximal tubule on the basis of in vitro studies similar to those used in the functional characterization of OAT1. These include the basolateral proximal tubular transporters OAT2 (33Kobayashi Y. Ohshiro N. Shibusawa A. Sasaki T. Tokuyama S. Sekine T. Endou H. Yamamoto T. Mol.

We have now generated a colony of OAT1 knock-out mice, permitting elucidation of the role of OAT1 in vivo. We find that loss of OAT1 leads to a striking decrease in the tubular secretion of organic anions, including reduced secretion of the loop diuretic, furosemide, resulting in a rightward shift of the dose-natriuresis response curve for this drug. These results indicate a critical role for OAT1 in the functioning of the classical pathway and thus in the excretion of the numerous clinically important compounds counted among its substrates. We previously reported the generation and characterization of an OAT3 knock-out mouse with defects in organic anion transport. In that study, renal transport of substrate was only determined “ex vivo” (i.e. via experiments conducted on isolated tissue (specifically, renal cortical slices) removed from wild-type and knock-out mice). Accordingly, the possibility that mechanisms operating at the level of the whole kidney (or the entire organism) might supersede or otherwise compensate for the loss of OAT function could not be excluded. The current data indicate that, regardless of the potential contribution of OAT3 (or of OAT2 and MRP1), the bulk of organic anion transport during the basolateral uptake step of the classical pathway is mediated by OAT1. We have also analyzed the plasma and urine of wild-type and OAT1 knock-out mice for content of endogenous organic anions. Several compounds were markedly increased in the plasma and/or decreased in the urine of knock-out mice, consistent with loss of their renal secretion. Moreover, we have demonstrated that some of these compounds interact with OAT1 in vitro. These latter compounds might therefore represent physiological substrates of OAT1. Animals—Homologous recombination was used to replace part of the first exon of the OAT1 gene with a cassette encoding β-galactosidase and a neomycin-selectable marker (LacZ-Neo), resulting effectively in the loss of the ability to either transcribe or translate OAT1 (for details, see “Results”). Mice heterozygous for the OAT1 null allele (F1 generation) were generated at Deltagen, Inc. (Redwood City, CA) and back-crossed to C57BL/6J for a total of four generations. Heterozygous animals from the final back-cross were bred to each other, yielding knock-out and wild-type littermates of the same mixed genetic background, from which all animals used in the experiments described were descended. Mice were group-housed at up to five mice per cage under a 12-h light-dark cycle and were provided access to food and water ad libitum. All experiments were performed on male age-matched (within 2 weeks) mice that were between 12 and 20 weeks of age. Experimental protocols were in accordance with Ref. 79National Institutes of HealthGuide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1996Google Scholar and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Materials—[3H]PAH (∼4 Ci/mmol), [3H]estrone sulfate (ES; ∼46 Ci/mmol), and [3H]inulin (∼50 Ci/mmol) were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fluorescein was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Other unlabeled organic anions (probenecid, PAH, N-acetyl aspartate, benzoate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxyphenyllactate, and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate) were obtained from Sigma. All chemicals were >98% pure except for 3-hydroxybutyrate, which was >95% pure. Genotyping—Mice were genotyped by PCR analysis of genomic DNA isolated from tail snips as previously described (44Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26934-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Twenty ng of genomic DNA were used as template in multiplex PCRs using a single reverse primer recognizing a sequence downstream of the site of recombination and two forward primers recognizing sequences within the recombined region, one targeting the endogenous sequence and the other the inserted transgenic sequence; the respective sequences of these are 5′-TTGCTGAGGTTGGCATTAGCAGGTG-3′, 5′-TAGGACTGGAGGTCCTCAGGCATTG-3′, 5′-GGGTGGGATTAGATAAATGCCTGCTCT-3′. Cycle parameters were as follows: denaturing at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C denaturing for 20 s, 60 °C annealing for 20 s, and 72 °C extension for 20 s. Amplification from the endogenous sequence (present in wild-type and heterozygous mice) yields a 223-bp PCR product, whereas amplification from the recombined sequence (present in knock-out and heterozygous mice) yields a 493-bp product. PCRs were visualized by electrophoresis through 1.3% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. Northern Analysis, Histology, and Immunohistochemistry—Northern analysis was performed as previously described (16Eraly S.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26934-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μg of total kidney RNA from three each of wild-type and OAT1 knock-out male mice were electrophoresed in a denaturing gel and then transferred to a charged nylon membrane. The OAT1 probe template (a 2.1-kb fragment corresponding to the entire cDNA sequence) was derived from the Image clone BC021647 by restriction digestion followed by gel isolation. 32P-labeled probes generated by random priming were hybridized to the Northern membrane overnight at 42 °C in Ultra-Hyb buffer (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX), and the membrane was then washed at high stringency prior to autoradiography. Tissues for histological analysis were collected from three each of wild-type and OAT1 knock-out male mice and either processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining or quick frozen. β-Galactosidase staining on frozen sections was performed by the University of California San Diego Cancer Center Histology Shared Resource facility (La Jolla, CA). Frozen sections for immunohistochemistry were treated with boiling water for 15 min to expose cryptic antigenic sites and then incubated with the OAT1 antibody (diluted 1:500; Alpha Diagnostic Inc., San Antonio, TX) at 4 °C overnight, followed by binding of secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa-fluor 568 (diluted 1:1000; Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 2 h. General Phenotypic Analysis—Urine for chemical analysis was obtained by picking up the mice to elicit reflex urination and then holding them over a Petri dish for sample collection. Generally, it was necessary to combine collections performed on multiple occasions (on the same animal) to yield quantities sufficient for chemical analysis (200–300 μl). Plasma for chemical analysis was obtained by cardiac puncture with a heparinized syringe, while mice were under terminal pentobarbital anesthesia, typically yielding 600–700 μl of blood, which was then centrifuged to yield ∼300 μl of plasma. All analyses were performed by the Clinical Laboratory of the University of California San Diego Medical Center (San Diego, CA), except where otherwise noted. Determination of general metabolic parameters was performed in indirect, open circuit calorimeter chambers (Columbus Instruments, Columbus OH). These chambers provided measures of oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and locomotor activity as well as food and water intake. Data were collected every 30 min over three 12-h dark cycles and two 12-h light cycles and collapsed across these 12-h intervals for subsequent analysis. Uptake in Renal Slices—Determination of uptake in renal slices was performed essentially as described previously (44Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Fujiwara Y. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26934-26943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice received terminal anesthesia with pentobarbital, and kidneys were immediately dissected and placed into freshly oxygenated ice-cold saline. Tissue slices (0.5 mm in thickness; ∼10 mg, wet weight) were cut with a Stadie-Riggs microtome and maintained in ice-cold modified Cross and Taggart saline until uptake assays were performed (generally <15 min). Slices were then incubated with substrate (0.25 μm [3H]PAH, 0.25 μm [3H]estrone sulfate, or 1 μm fluorescein, in the presence and absence of 1 mm probenecid) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the slices were removed from the uptake medium and blotted, weighed, and dissolved in 1 ml of 1 m NaOH, followed by neutralization with 1 ml of 1 m HCl. [3H]PAH and [3H]ES were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Fluorescein was quantified by determination of fluorescence intensity (emission 520 nm, excitation 485 nm), with correction for autofluorescence as measured in aliquots of dissolved tissue from slices that were not incubated in fluorescein. Duplicate medium samples were also assayed, and data are presented as the ratio of concentration in tissue to concentration in medium (T/M ratios). For each of the 12 uptake conditions (uptake of each of three substrates, by knock-out or wild-type slices, in the presence or absence of probenecid), measurements were made in two independent experiments and in a total of six slices, derived from 4–6 different wild-type matched to 4–6 different knock-out animals (a total of 16 wild-type and 16 knock-out mice were used). In Vivo Analysis of Kidney Function, Organic Anion Clearance, and Diuretic Response—Measurement of basal kidney function and in vivo clearance was performed as previously described (45Huang D.Y.

Schnermann J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 448: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, a total of 11 wild-type and 12 knock-out mice were anesthetized for terminal clearance experiments with 100 mg/kg inactin intraperitoneally and 100 mg/kg ketamine intramuscularly; 20% of this dose was readministered intraperitoneally every hour to maintain anesthesia until euthanasia. The femoral artery was cannulated for blood pressure measurement and blood sample withdrawal, the jugular vein was cannulated for continuous maintenance infusion of 2.25 g/dl bovine serum albumin in 0.85% NaCl at a rate of 0.5 ml/h/30 g, body weight, and the bladder was catheterized for collection of urine. In one set of mice, unlabeled PAH was infused into six matched pairs of wild-type and OAT1 knock-out mice at doses ranging from 35 to 4200 ng/min/g, body weight, for determination of PAH clearance (each pair of mice receiving a different dose), whereas [3H]inulin was infused at the uniform rate of 20 μCi/h/30 g, body weight, for assessment of the glomerular filtration rate. In a separate set of mice (five wild-type and six knock-out), 3H-labeled ES was infused at a rate of 15 ng/min/g for determination of ES clearance. After surgery, the mice were allowed to stabilize for 60 min. Then a timed urine collection was performed for 30 min using a bladder catheter, with blood withdrawn at the beginning and end of the collection period. Concentrations of inulin and ES were determined by liquid scintillation counting, and concentration of PAH was determined with a colorimetric assay following precipitation of plasma proteins, as previously described (47Dalton R.N. Wiseman M.J. Turner C. Viberti G. Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 117-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 48Vallon V. Albinus M. Blach D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 1215-1221PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of plasma ES, which, unlike PAH (49MacDougall M.L. Wiegmann T.B. J. Physiol. 1988; 397: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 50Donoso V.S. Grantham J.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1986; 107: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar), is highly protein-bound (51Bouhamidi R.

Gynecol. 1988; 159: 509-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), both protein-free and total concentrations were measured for each individual mouse in the experiment (protein-free concentrations were determined using centrifugal filter devices (Microton; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA)). Approximately 30 min after conclusion of the PAH clearance experiments, the natriuretic response to intravenous application of furosemide was assessed. Since PAH clearance differed between genotypes, it is important to note that in both knock-out and wild-type mice, the ED50 values of the natriuretic response were independent of the PAH dose applied in the initial clearance experiment. This is consistent with the assumption that any PAH remaining in the circulation (after letting the kidneys clear PAH for 30 min before application of diuretic) did not exert a significant effect on the response to furosemide. Slow bolus application of vehicle (0.85% NaCl, 30 μl/25 g, body weight, over 1 min) was followed by bolus application of increasing doses of furosemide (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg). After each bolus and allowing 2 min for drug distribution, urine was collected via a bladder catheter for 5–10 min, depending on urinary flow rate. Arterial blood pressure was recorded at the midpoint of every collection period. Finally, before euthanizing the mice by intravenous application of saturated KCl at the end of the experiment, in some cases, kidneys were excised and decapsulated, and the wet weight was determined. Concentrations of Na+ and K+ in plasma and urine were determined using a flame photometer (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co., Vernon Hills, IL). Furosemide concentrations in urine were determined by modification of the PAH assay (which, as reported before (53Richterich R. Clinical Chemistry, 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., New York1969Google Scholar), can detect sulfonamide therapeutic agents); standards and samples were diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride to a 100-μl final volume, acid-hydrolyzed (by the addition of 5 μl of 37% HCl, followed by incubation at 70 °C for 10 min), and centrifuged (16,000 × g for 1 min). To 100 μl of supernatant, 20 μl of distilled water and 20 μl of 0.1 g/dl sodium nitrite (NaNO2) were added, and reactions were incubated for 3 min at room temperature; then 20 μl of 0.5 g/dl ammonium sulfamate (NH4SO3NH2) were added, followed by incubation for an additional 3 min at room temperature; finally, 20 μl of coupling reagent (N-1-naphthyl-ethylendiamine-dehydrochloride (0.1 g/dl)) were added, and reactions were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before absorbance was read at 544 nm. The furosemide calibration curve was linear between 0.001 and 0.1 mg/ml. Spiking of standards with furosemide-free urine from knock-out and wild-type mice confirmed that there was no background interference. Sufficient urine for colorimetric detection of furosemide in both genotypes was obtained after the 3- and 10-mg/kg doses of the diuretic. At these time points, plasma PAH (and therefore probably urinary PAH as well) was estimated to be reduced to less than 1% of initial levels in the knock-out"
https://openalex.org/W2000037965,"Structural changes upon photoreduction caused by x-ray irradiation of the water-oxidizing tetramanganese complex of photosystem II were investigated by x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the manganese K-edge. Photoreduction was directly proportional to the x-ray dose. It was faster in the higher oxidized S2 state than in S1; seemingly the oxidizing potential of the metal site governs the rate. X-ray irradiation of the S1 state at 15 K initially caused single-electron reduction to S0* accompanied by the conversion of one di-μ-oxo bridge between manganese atoms, previously separated by ∼2.7 Å, to a mono-μ-oxo motif. Thereafter, manganese photoreduction was 100 times slower, and the biphasic increase in its rate between 10 and 300 K with a breakpoint at ∼200 K suggests that protein dynamics is rate-limiting the radical chemistry. For photoreduction at similar x-ray doses as applied in protein crystallography, halfway to the final MnII4 state the complete loss of inter-manganese distances <3Å was observed, even at 10 K, because of the destruction of μ-oxo bridges between manganese ions. These results put into question some structural attributions from recent protein crystallography data on photosystem II.

By the sequential absorption of four quanta of visible light by PSII that drive the stepwise abstraction of four electrons, the manganese complex cycles through four semi-stable states called S1, S2,S3, and S0, where the subscripts denote the number of accumulated oxidizing equivalents (2Kok B. Forbush B. McGloin M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1970; 11: 457-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). The S1 represents the dark-stable state; dioxygen is liberated only in the S3 → S0 transition (for reviews see Refs. 1Nugent J.H.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Important structural information on the manganese complex has been obtained by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) (Refs. 4Dau H. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Biochim. Biophys.

With respect to the manganese complex, however, the question has emerged regarding to what extent the obtained structural information is invalidated by modifications caused by the numerous radicals that are inevitably created by x-ray irradiation (11Biesiadka J. Loll B. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Zouni A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4733-4736Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 12Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Phys. Chem. Chem.

In addition, surprisingly few amino acid side chains were at a reasonably short distance to provide ligands (Fig. 1). Water molecules, which were invisible at the best resolution of 3.2 Å (11Biesiadka J. Loll B. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Zouni A. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4733-4736Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar), or disorder effects may explain the void around manganese. As previously estimated (12Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 6: 4781-4792Crossref Google Scholar), recently shown by XAS on PSII crystals (14Yano J. Kern J. Irrgang K.-D. Latimer M.J. Bergmann U. Glatzel P. Pushkar Y. Biesiadka J. Loll B. Sauer K.

A. 2005; 102: 12047-12052Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), and substantiated in this work, all crystallographic data likely refer to a metal site where x-ray exposure resulted in reduction of the initially high valent manganese ions to the MnII level. In protein crystallography, which is mostly done at 100 K at high flux third generation synchrotron radiation sources, prolonged x-ray irradiation of crystals eventually leads to a decrease in the diffracted intensity (15Carugo O. Carugo H.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 213-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Gonzales A. Nave C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Structure. 2000; 8: 315-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Frequently, data collection is continued until this “radiation damage” becomes too pronounced for compensation by scaling of mosaicity and temperature factors. This approach becomes critical, if distinct modifications occur already prior to the loss in diffraction quality. Indeed, specific structural changes result from x-ray irradiation at ∼13 keV (0.95 Å) even at low temperatures, e.g. breaking of disulfide bonds, modification of carboxylates and histidines, and tyrosine dehydroxylation, before the global fading out of diffraction intensity (18Burmeister W.P.

Biol. 2003; 13: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Reduction of active site transition metal ions may precede modifications of the protein matrix (21Berglund G.I. Carlsson G.H.

Biochem. 1982; 124: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the present study, the influence of ionizing x-ray irradiation on the manganese complex of PSII is investigated systematically by XAS at the manganese K-edge (23Scott R.A. Que Jr., L. Physical Methods in Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Sausalito, CA2000: 465-503Google Scholar, 24Koningsberger D.C. Mojet B.I. Van Dorssen G.E. Ramaker D.E. Topics Catal. 2000; 10: 143-155Crossref Google Scholar). As opposed to crystallography, XAS is particularly sensitive to the oxidation state and local structure of protein-bound metal centers (6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The position on the energy scale of the K-edge in the XANES region of XAS spectra is indicative of the formal oxidation state of the metal, at least in the case of the manganese complex of PSII (see Ref. 6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and the references therein), and thus was employed to monitor the time course of the photoreduction process. The EXAFS spectral region, which carries information on the metal-ligand distances, on the number and chemical nature of ligands, and on the geometry of the site, e.g. as maintained by well known bridging motifs such as di- and mono-μ-oxo bridges between the metal ions, was scrutinized in detail to detect changes in the structure of the manganese complex. The relations between x-ray flux and exposure time, temperature, and the rate and extent of manganese photoreduction and the associated structural changes were quantified. The implications of the results for interpretation of the crystallographic data are discussed. The obtained insights are of likely relevance for protein-bound metal centers in general and for the use of x-ray photoreduction as a specific tool to study intermediates of the catalytic cycle. Sample Preparation and S-State Population—PSII-enriched membrane particles were prepared from market spinach using betaine as a stabilizer in all media as described in Refs. 25Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J.

Their oxygen evolution activity under saturating white light illumination was 1200–1400 μmolofO2 (mg chlorophyll × h)–1 at 28 °C. PSII membrane particles were dissolved at 1 mg/ml of chlorophyll in a medium containing 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 m betaine, and 25 mm MES, pH 6.2, and partially dehydrated membrane multilayer samples on Kapton foil were prepared by the previously described centrifugation technique (25Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and enriched in the S1 state using a preflash protocol (7Haumann M.

Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). S2 state samples were prepared by continuous white light illumination (440 nm < λ < 750 nm) of S1 samples for 2 min at the 200 K of a dry ice/ethanol bath (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P.

Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Quantitative population of the S2 state was verified by EPR measurements (not shown) of its well known multiline signal (27Dismukes G.C. Siderer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 274-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). XAS at Low Flux, Bending Magnet Beam Line—XAS measurements at the manganese K-edge were performed at the EMBL bending magnet beam line D2 at Hamburg Synchrotron Laboratory (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany) using an energy-resolving solid state 13-element germanium detector (Canberra) for fluorescence detection (25Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Si111 crystal monochromator was detuned to 70% of maximal flux. The samples were kept in a helium cryostat at 20 K under ∼200 mbar of helium gas. The x-ray spot size on the samples was ∼4 × 1 mm. The scan duration (6400–7100 eV) was ∼20 min. XAS at High Flux, Undulator Beam Line—XAS measurements at cryogenic temperatures as well as at room temperature were carried out at the undulator beam line ID26 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Manganese XAS spectra were measured by monitoring the excited x-ray fluorescence perpendicularly to the incident beam by a PIN photodiode (3.8-cm2 active area; Eurisys Meassures), as in Refs. 6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and 28Meinke C. Sole V.A. Pospisil P. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. In the room temperature experiments, the samples were exposed to plain air of the climatized (18 ± 2 °C) experimental hutch of the beam line. In the low temperature experiments, the samples were kept in a helium cryostat at ∼200 mbar of helium gas. Rapid scan XAS spectra were collected by simultaneous scanning of a Si220 crystal monochromator (scan range, 6500–7100 eV; x-ray spot size on the sample, ∼1 × 1 mm) and the undulator gap in the rapid scan mode of ID26 (29Sole V.A. Gauthier C. Goulon J. Natali F. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 1999; 6: 174-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as described in Refs. 28Meinke C. Sole V.A. Pospisil P. Dau H.

At both synchrotron radiation sources, the angle between the electric field vector of the incident x-ray beam and the sample normal was 55° (magic angle; see Ref. 31Dittmer J. Dau H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8196-8200Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Energy calibration of each XAS spectrum was facilitated by simultaneous measurements and Gaussian simulation of the narrow pre-edge peak absorption centered at 6543.3 eV of a KMnO4 powder sample mounted in front of a detector at the end of the beam line. The accuracy of the energy calibration procedure is better than ± 0.1 eV (25Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Meinke C. Sole V.A. Pospisil P. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Data Evaluation—XAS spectra were normalized, and EXAFS oscillations were extracted and transformed to a wave vector scale (k scale) using an E0 value of 6540 eV as described in Ref. 6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar. Edge energies were determined by the “integral method” (6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). EXAFS oscillations were weighted by k3 to compensate for the fall-off of amplitudes with increasing energy. Spectra were simulated by a least squares procedure using the in-house software SimX (32Dittmer J. Linear Dichroism X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy on the Catalytic Cycle of the Water-splitting Manganese Complex of Photosynthesis in Theory and Experiment. 1999; (Ph. D. Thesis, Christian Albrechts Universität Kiel, Germany)Google Scholar). Complex phase functions for different elements in the various shells of backscatterers were calculated using FEFF-7 (33Rehr J.J. Mustre de Leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5140Crossref Scopus (1826) Google Scholar). The amplitude reduction factor, S 20, was 0.85. In the simulations a value for E0 of 6547 eV was consistently used. The fit quality was judged by calculation of the Fourier-filtered R-factor (RF) (28Meinke C. Sole V.A. Pospisil P. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7033-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) subsequently to the curve fit itself, which involved only unfiltered EXAFS oscillations (6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Fourier transforms of EXAFS oscillations were calculated for energies between 20 and 500 eV above E0 using fractional cosine windows extending over 10% at high and low ends of the k range. X-ray Photoreduction of the Manganese Complex at 10–20 K—A series of consecutive XANES spectra was collected on one single spot on the PSII samples. These spectra reflect the radiation-induced modifications of the manganese complex, which gradually develop with increasing x-ray exposure time. To resolve the initial steps of the x-ray photoreduction of manganese at 20 K, spectra were collected at a low flux bending magnet beam line (D2, Hamburg Synchrotron Laboratory, Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, Hamburg, Germany). The slower photoreduction steps became experimentally accessible only at an undulator beam line (ID26, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France), where the x-ray flux was ∼3 orders of magnitude higher and photoreduction was accelerated accordingly. Reduction of manganese typically results in a shift of its K-edge position to lower energies (6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows edge spectra of the manganese complex not previously exposed to X-rays for the dark-stable S1 state and for the S2 state, both measured at the low flux beam line at 20 K. The oxidation state of the Mn4 complex in these states most likely is MnIII2MnIV2 and MnIIIMnIV3, respectively (Ref. 7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar and the references therein). Accordingly, the light-induced S1 → S2 transition is associated with a one-electron oxidation of the Mn4 complex, which causes a shift of the K-edge by 0.5–0.9 eV to higher energies (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J.

Using the integral method (6Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), a similar upshift by ∼0.7 eV as previously found (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) was obtained here (Fig. 2). For samples in the more oxidized S2 state, ∼6 h of x-ray irradiation at the low flux beam line yielded a XANES spectrum, which resembles that of S1 with respect to edge energy and shape (Fig. 2). The K-edge position at 20 K in the S1 and S2 state samples as a function of the x-ray exposure time is shown in Fig. 3. For samples initially in S2 (triangles), it was confirmed that ∼6 h of irradiation caused reduction by 1 equivalent of the Mn4 complex as judged by the downshift of the K-edge energy by ∼0.7 eV. On the other hand, for samples initially in S1 (circles), ∼18 h of irradiation yielded a downshift by ∼0.7 eV (Fig. 3) to a state that resembled the native S0 (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with respect to its edge energy (Fig. 2). Thus, the initial photoreduction of the manganese complex in its higher oxidized S2 state was more than two times faster than in S1. We conclude that the velocity of x-ray photoreduction critically depends on the oxidizing power of the metal center, in line with previous results (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The slower steps of x-ray photoreduction were monitored by collecting successive XAS spectra at 10 K at the high flux beam line on S1 state samples (Fig. 4B). A clearly biphasic decrease of the edge energy was observed. Its bi-exponential simulation yielded for the faster edge shift by approximately –0.7 eV a time constant of τfast = 1/kfast = 1.1 min. Comparison of the initial phase of photoreduction in Figs. 3 and 4 revealed its 600-fold acceleration at the high flux beam line, which is by a similar factor as the increase in the x-ray flux. The second main reduction phase accounting for most of the edge shift was described by τmain = 1/kmain = 110 min.

Open table in a new tab The edge energies in Fig. 4B were obtained from a series of complete XANES spectra. In Fig. 4C the edge energy was monitored by an alternative approach, namely the time scan technique (35Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Neisius T. Dau H. J. Synchrotron Radiat. 2005; 12: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The x-ray fluorescence intensity was recorded at a fixed excitation energy of 6549.5 eV. At this energy, the x-ray absorption and thus the excited fluorescence increases for increasing reduction of the manganese complex (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4 (B and C) reveals similar kinetic behavior of the K-edge energy and of the increase in the x-ray fluorescence. Thus, the time scan approach can be used to monitor the K-edge energy of the metal and hence the level of x-ray photoreduction in an experimentally efficient way, which may also be employed at crystallography beam lines. The pronouncedly biphasic downshift of the K-edge suggests the rapid formation of a discrete intermediate state upon the one-electron reduction of the manganese complex initially in S1. In the water oxidation cycle, the light-driven oxidation of S0 leads to S1. Thus, a single reduction of S1 leads to a formal S0 state. Accordingly, the one-electron reduction of S2 results in a formal S1 state. We denote the intermediates created by x-ray photoreduction as S0* and S1*, respectively. The similar XANES spectra suggest a close correspondence between the native states (S0 (7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and S1) and the x-ray-induced intermediates (S0* and S1*). Notably, the more reduced states beyond S0* created by prolonged x-ray irradiation have no precedent in the native catalytic cycle. Temperature Dependence of Photoreduction—Fig. 5 shows the results of x-ray photoreduction experiments at room temperature (290 K). Again, the irradiation time dependence of the edge shift did not exhibit a single-exponential behavior. Rather, as opposed to the rapid reduction phase observed at 10–20 K, at room temperature an initial lag phase was observed (Fig. 5A) as in Refs. 7Haumann M. Müller C. Liebisch P. Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1894-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar and 30Haumann M. Grabolle M. Neisius T. Dau H.

Accordingly, at room temperature the initial rate of photoreduction is close to zero, whereas it is particularly high at low temperatures. In the following, the initial phases were not considered but only the subsequent apparently monophasic reduction process, which accounts for the major fraction of the irradiation-induced edge shift. In comparison with the 10–20 K data, at room temperature the rate kmain of this photoreduction phase was accelerated by ∼2 orders of magnitude (Table 1). Fig. 5B reveals that also at room temperature the time scan technique can be employed to monitor x-ray photoreduction of the manganese complex properly. By measuring such fluorescence time scans in the range from 10 to 300 K and their single-exponential simulation, the temperature dependence of kmain was determined (Fig. 6). It is pronouncedly biphasic and reveals a sharp breakpoint around 200 K. Description of the data by a single activation energy was not possible as apparent from the Arrhenius-plot (ln kmain versus T–1) (not shown). Such a plot yielded an activation energy of 45 meV for temperatures ranging from 200 to 300 K but a value of only 0.2 meV between 10 and 50 K. Relation between X-ray Flux and Photoreduction Rate—The relation between the rate of photoreduction and the x-ray flux was investigated at the high flux beam line for PSII samples initially in the S1 state by the time scan technique (Fig. 7). The time scans carried out at 20 K with maximal"

We hypothesized that there is a potential role for photo-oxidation in OS uptake by RPE via scavenger receptor-mediated recognition of structurally defined lipid peroxidation products. We now demonstrate that specific structurally defined oxidized species derived from arachidonyl, linoleoyl, and docosahexanoyl phosphatidylcholine may serve as endogenous ligands on OSs for uptake by RPE via the scavenger receptor CD36. Mass spectrometry studies of retinal lipids recovered from dark-adapted rats following physiological light exposure demonstrate in vivo formation of specific oxidized phosphatidylcholine molecular species possessing a CD36 recognition motif, an oxidatively truncated sn-2 acyl group with a terminal γ-hydroxy(or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl. Cellular studies using RPE isolated from wild-type versus CD36 null mice suggest that CD36 plays a role in engulfment, but not initial binding, of OSs via these oxidized phospholipids. Parallel increases in OS protein-bound nitrotyrosine, a post-translational modification by nitric oxide (NO)-derived oxidants, were also observed, suggesting a possible role for light-induced generation of NO-derived oxidants in the initiation of OS lipid peroxidation. Collectively, these studies suggest that intense light exposure promotes “oxidative tagging” of photoreceptor outer segments with structurally defined choline glycerophospholipids that may serve as a physiological signal for CD36-mediated phagocytosis under oxidant stress conditions.

New disks are constantly generated at the basal end of OS disk stacks, and old disks then shed from the apical tip where they are digested by phagocytic retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Shedding is believed to occur because OSs are routinely damaged, possibly by oxidative modifications spawned by photo-generated radicals (1.Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 2.LaVail M.M. Science. 1976; 194: 1071-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). For example, albino rats reared in cyclic light demonstrate a burst of retinal OS disk shedding soon after the onset of light, with the number of large packets of OSs in RPE substantially greater than at any other time of day or night, suggesting that light damage triggers OS phagocytosis by RPE (2.LaVail M.M. Science. 1976; 194: 1071-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). OSs are rich in unsaturated lipids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The presence of six allylic groups within DHA renders this highly unsaturated fatty acid exquisitely sensitive to oxidation, a process likely further facilitated by the localized oxygen and light-rich environment of the retina (3.Fliesler S.J. Anderson R.E. Prog. Lipid Res. 1983; 22: 79-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Phagosomes arising from OS shedding have been shown to increase dramatically in RPE of rats exposed to intense light in intermittent light/dark cycles, whereas ascorbate treatment has been shown to prevent the accumulation of phagosomes (4.Blanks J.C. Pickford M.S. Organisciak D.T. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1992; 33: 2814-2821PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that oxidative modification of OSs may occur in the retina and that phospholipid peroxidation products may serve as signaling molecules for RPE phagocytosis (5.Watson C.L. Gold M.R. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Phagocytosis of OSs by the RPE is a receptor-mediated process (1.Young R.W. Bok D. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) involving at least two independent steps. Shed OSs initiate a signaling pathway within RPE via the integrin αvβ5 (6.Nandrot E.F. Kim Y. Brodie S.E. Huang X. Sheppard D. Finnemann S.C. J. Exp.

In vitro data suggest that other RPE surface receptors, such as the class B scavenger receptor CD36 (13.Ryeom S.W. Sparrow J.R. Silverstein R.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 387-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the mannose receptor (14.Boyle D. Tien L.F. Cooper N.G. Shepherd V. McLaughlin B.J. Invest Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1991; 32: 1464-1470PubMed Google Scholar), are also involved in phagocytosis of OSs by the RPE. Blocking CD36 by either anionic phospholipids or CD36 antibody partially inhibits OS uptake by RPE in vitro (15.Ryeom S.W. Silverstein R.L. Scotto A. Sparrow J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20536-20539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and ligation of CD36 appears to serve a signaling function in RPE leading to enhanced uptake of OSs (16.Finnemann S.C. Silverstein R.L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1289-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The nature of ligands on OSs recognized by phagocytic receptors, including CD36, remains undefined.CD36 is a heavily glycosylated, single chain, integral plasma membrane protein that belongs to an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that serve as scavenger and lipid receptors (17.Silverstein R.L.

Synthetic methods for generation of individual oxPCCD36 were developed (24.Sun M. Deng Y. Batyreva E. Sha W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2002; 67: 3575-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and then these species were shown to selectively inhibit the binding of oxLDL to CD36-transfected cells. Vesicles containing low mole % of synthetic oxPCCD36 were also shown to be taken up by cells via CD36 (24.Sun M. Deng Y. Batyreva E. Sha W. Salomon R.G. J. Org.

A common structural motif for all oxPCCD36 species was identified as an oxidatively truncated sn-2 acyl group with a terminal γ-hydroxy(or oxo)-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that oxPCCD36 are generated by a variety of oxidation processes and are enriched in atherosclerotic plaques (26.Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y.

High levels of carboxyethylpyrrole modifications of proteins are observed in retinas of individuals with age-related macular degeneration, providing presumptive evidence for the generation of docosahexaenoate-derived oxidatively truncated phospholipids in retinal pathology (27.Gu X. Meer S.G. Miyagi M. Rayborn M.E. Hollyfield J.G. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42027-42035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Based upon known mechanisms of lipid peroxidation, we recently generated a family of presumed oxidation products of the docosahexaenoate ester of 2-lysophosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) by total syntheses, and then confirmed their formation by free radical-induced oxidative cleavage of DHA-PC in vitro (28.Gu X. Sun M. Gugiu B. Hazen S. Crabb J.W. Salomon R.G. J. Org. Chem. 2003; 68: 3749-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that oxPCCD36 derived from DHA-PC are generated on OSs as a consequence of oxidative stress, such as with light exposure, and that these oxidized choline glycerophospholipids might serve as a physiological signal to facilitate OS phagocytosis by RPE via CD36. Herein we structurally identify specific oxPCs derived from DHA-PC photo-oxidation and further show that oxPCCD36 derived from DHA-PC, PAPC, and PLPC and their down-stream oxidation products, are produced in vivo within the retina of dark-adapted rats following intense light exposure. Finally, using RPE isolated from CD36 knock-out mice, we demonstrate that RPE-mediated internalization of OSs is facilitated via CD36-specific interaction with oxPCCD36. Our findings suggest that light-induced oxidation of retinal OSs phospholipids such as DHA-PC may serve as a physiological “eat me” signal for CD36-mediated phagocytosis by RPE.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Na125I was supplied by ICN Pharmaceutical, Inc. PLPC, PAPC, DHA-PC, 1,2-ditridecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DTPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Synthetic oxPCs were prepared as previously described (24.Sun M. Deng Y. Batyreva E. Sha W. Salomon R.G. J. Org.

LDL was prepared from human plasma and oxidized by exposure to leukocyte myeloperoxidase in the presence of nitrite as previously described (22.Podrez E.A. Febbraio M. Sheibani N. Schmitt D.

Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless specified.Photo-oxidation of DHA-PC—DHA-PC (1 mg) was hydrated at 37 °C for 1 h in argon-sparged phosphate buffer (1 ml) supplemented with DTPA to minimize transition metal-induced auto-oxidation. The hydrated DHA-PC were then made into unilamellar vesicles by extrusion using an Avanti Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc). The vesicles (400 μl) were kept in the dark under argon blanket at room temperature until use the same day. Photo-oxidation was performed by transfer of vesicles into a quartz tube placed in the center of a Rayonet photochemical reactor with three 80-watt low pressure mercury UV (254 or 350 nm) lamps (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Midtown, CT). Reaction mixtures were incubated in air with temperature maintained at 28 °C. Sampling (30 μl) was performed at various times, and the reaction was stopped by adding catalase (10 μl and 150 μm final) and butylated hydroxytoluene (2 μl and 40 μm final). For quantification purposes, lipid extraction was performed immediately after addition of DTPC (300 ng) using the method of Bligh and Dyer (30.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar). Extracts were dried under N2 and stored in vials sealed under argon at -80 °C until analysis.Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Light-irradiated DHA-PC—Mass spectrometric analyses of irradiated DHA-PC was performed on an ABI 365 mass spectrometer equipped with Ionics EP 10+ upgrade (Concord, Ontario, Canada), interfaced with a Waters 2790 (Waters, Milford, MA) HPLC system. Oxidized DHA-PC (30 μg) was dissolved in 1 ml of methanol. The solution (10 μl) was diluted with 140 μl of methanol containing 10% water. This solution (50 μl) was chromatographed on a Prodigy ODS C18 column (150 × 2 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with a binary solvent gradient, starting from 100% water for the first 5 min, then a linear gradient to 100% methanol in 15 min, and then 100% methanol for 20 min, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. All mobile phase solvents contained 0.2% formic acid. The total ion current was obtained in the mass range of m/z 200–1000 using a cone energy of 30 V in the positive ion mode. Three kV was applied to the electrospray capillary.Characterization of DHA-PC Oxidation Products as CD36 Ligands—Specific binding of synthetic oxPC species were determined in competition binding assays employing 125I-labeled LDL exposed to the myeloperoxidase/H2O2/NO2- system ([125I]NO2LDL) and CD36 cDNA-transfected 293 cells, as previously described (25.Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol.

Presentation of the individual oxPC was normalized by incorporation as a low mol % component (10%) of vesicles generated with POPC as carrier (25.Podrez E.A. Poliakov E. Shen Z. Zhang R. Deng Y. Sun M. Finton P.J. Shan L. Gugiu B. Fox P.L. Hoff H.F. Salomon R.G. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38503-38516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). CD36 independent binding of [125I]NO2LDL was assessed in control vector-transfected 293 cells and subtracted from binding to CD36-transfected 293 cells, whose binding was typically <10–20% that of CD36-transfected cells. Each measurement was performed in triplicate, and results shown represent averages from at least three independent experiments.RPE Cells—An SV40-transformed cell line derived from rat RPE, RPE-J cells, has been previously characterized and is frequently used to study phagocytic function (31.Nabi I.R. Mathews A.P. Cohen-Gould L. Gundersen D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 37-49PubMed Google Scholar). These cells were routinely maintained at 32 °C in DMEM supplemented with 4% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded at 50% confluence on 5-mm glass coverslips in 96-well plates and grown for 6–7 days before use at a density of 3.3 × 105 cells/well. Under these conditions, RPE-J cells possess epithelial morphology and apical expression of phagocytic proteins αvβ5 and MerTK (32.Finnemann S.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Where indicated, primary RPE cells were used. These were obtained from both CD36 null mice and wild-type C57Bl/6 controls. CD36 nulls were backcrossed seven times onto a C57Bl background. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation at 12–14 days of age. Following eyeball enucleation and removal of cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous, eyecups were incubated in 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase in Ca2+ and Mg2+-free Hanks' buffered saline solution to detach neural retinas from the underlying RPE. A circumferential cut was made just below the ora serrata to remove neural retinas from eyecups. Eyecups with exposed RPE apical surface were further incubated in 2 mg/ml trypsin in Hanks' buffered saline solution containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ for 45 min at 37 °C. Sheets of RPE were peeled off Bruch's membrane, trypsinized, pelleted, resuspended, and seeded as patches in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary RPE cells were routinely used 4–7 days after preparation. To characterize epithelial morphology, we fixed samples with ice-cold methanol and labeled nuclei with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide and tight junctions with ZO-1 antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and secondary alexa488-conjugated antibodies (Molecular Probes). Laser scanning confocal microscopy using a Leica TSP2 system revealed no significant difference in yield, attachment, spreading, or pigmentation of RPE derived from CD36 null compared with wild-type controls.OS Phagocytosis Assays by RPE Cells—OSs were isolated on 25–60% sucrose gradients from fresh bovine retinas according to established protocols (32.Finnemann S.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4143-4154Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as previously described (7.Finnemann S.C. Bonilha V.L. Marmorstein A.D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). RPE cells on 5-mm coverslips in 96 well plates were incubated with FITC-labeled OSs (5 × 106 OSsin40 μl/well, in excess of 10 OSs/RPE cell) in DMEM with 5% fetal bovine serum in the presence of lipids or ethanol solvent at a concentration of 1%. At the end of the incubation time, excess OSs were removed and cells were washed. To quench external OSs, samples were incubated with 0.4% trypan blue for 10 min, before washing and fixation in ice-cold methanol. Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. FITC and propidium iodide fluorescence of coverslips mounted on slides was quantified by fluorescence scanning on a STORM 860 scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Data were evaluated using Molecular Dynamics ImageQuaNT version 1.2 software. Samples were also evaluated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Individual X-Y scans were acquired from representative fields. All studies included parallel control cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays to evaluate if exposures reduced cell viability. We did not observe toxicity of compounds or solvents on any of the RPE preparations when testing cell viability and signs of apoptosis by trypan blue dye exclusion and nuclear DNA fragmentation, respectively.Light Exposure of Sprague-Dawley Rats and Retina Harvest—Weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) and maintained in a darkened room for 60 days. Animals were exposed to green light (∼1200 lux; 200 microwatts/cm2) for periods of either 1 or 4 h, as described previously (33.Delmelle M. Noell W.K. Organisciak D.T. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 21: 369-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), at which time animals were euthanized and retinas rapidly harvested as described (34.Organisciak D.T. Darrow R.M. Barsalou L. Kutty R.K. Wiggert B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3694-3701PubMed Google Scholar). Excised retinas were immediately placed into argon-sparged saline (0.9%), supplemented with antioxidant mixture (100 μm butylated hydroxytoluene and 2 mm DTPA, pH 7) and rinsed of any free blood. Individual retinas were then rapidly submerged in 1-ml cryo vials filled with 0.75 ml of argon-sparged anti-oxidant mixture-containing saline, headspace-purged with argon, capped, snap frozen in liquid N2, and then stored at -80 °C until analysis.Separation of Phospholipids from Retina—To prevent artificial oxidation of retina, all procedures were performed rapidly within a dark room with dim red light. All glassware tubes and pipette tips were washed with nitric acid to remove trace transition metals, extensively rinsed with Chelex-treated water containing 1 μm DTPA, and then rinsed with pure Chelex-treated water. Plastic tips were further rinsed in methanol and air-dried prior to use. All glassware was baked at 500 °C for 24 h to remove residual organics. Retinas were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at 4 °C. Tissue was homogenized with a Teflon pestle in a form-fitting plastic vial with argon blanket. Vial contents were transferred to 10-ml threaded glass test tubes equipped with teflon-lined caps, and then lipids within samples were extracted using the method of Bligh and Dyer (30.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar) under argon after addition of 5 ng of DTPC as internal standard, followed by immediate HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) analysis. Extraction efficiencies of each of the oxPCs indicated (Fig. 1A) were determined using synthetic authentic oxPC species and the corresponding precursor (PA-PC, PL-PC, and DHA-PC) and DTPC as internal standard. After extraction, the amounts recovered were determined by LC/ESI/MS/MS.Mass Spectrometric Analysis of Phospholipids—Lipid extracts were re-dissolved in methanol:water (90:10) and LC/ESI/MS/MS performed using a Prodigy ODS C18 column for separation of lipids and the HPLC solvent system described above. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed online using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode (cone energy 30 V/collision energy 25 eV). The MRM transitions used to detect individual oxidized phospholipids were the mass to charge ratio (m/z) for the molecular cation [M+H]+ and their daughter ion 184, the phosphatidylcholine group. Calibration curves for quantitative analyses of individual oxPC molecular species were constructed by mixing a fixed amount"

The primary source of lipoproteins in the brain is astroglia cells that synthesize and secrete apolipoprotein (apo) E in high density lipoprotein-like particles. Small quantities of apoA1, derived from the peripheral circulation, are also present in the brain. In addition to the direct secretion of apoE-containing lipoproteins from astroglia, glia-derived lipoproteins are thought to be formed by cholesterol efflux to extracellular apolipoproteins via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. We used cultured cerebellar murine astroglia to investigate the relationship among cholesterol availability, apoE secretion, expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1, and cholesterol efflux. In many cell types, cholesterol content, ABCA1 expression, and cholesterol efflux are closely correlated. In contrast, cholesterol enrichment of glia failed to increase ABCA1 expression, although ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux to apoA1 were increased. Moreover, the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist TO901317 up-regulated ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression in glia without stimulating cholesterol efflux. Larger lipoproteins were generated when glia were enriched with cholesterol, whereas treatment with the LXR agonist produced smaller particles that were eliminated when the glia were loaded with cholesterol. We also used glia from ApoE–/– mice to distinguish between direct lipoprotein secretion and the extracellular generation of lipoproteins. Our observations indicate that partially lipidated apoE, secreted directly by glia, is likely to be the major extracellular acceptor of cholesterol released from glia in a process mediated by ABCG1.

The human brain contains 15–20% of total body cholesterol but represents only ∼5% of total body weight (1.Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Cholesterol is a key component of all membranes, including myelin, in the central nervous system (CNS), 4The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; apo, apolipoprotein; ABC, ATP-binding cassette transporter; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HDL, high density lipoproteins; LDL, low density lipoproteins; LXR, liver X receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; qPCR, quantitative PCR. and cholesterol is synthesized continuously, albeit at a low rate, in the adult brain (1.Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). All cholesterol in the CNS is synthesized within the CNS rather than being imported from the periphery (2.Turley S.D. Burns D.K. Rosenfeld C.R. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1953-1961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a mechanism for maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS, cholesterol can be converted into the more polar 24-hydroxycholesterol, which is released into the circulation by a subset of neurons (3.Lutjohann D. Breuer O. Ahlborg G. Nennesmo I. Siden A. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9799-9804Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 4.Lund E.G. Xie C. Kotti T.

Because cholesterol metabolism and distribution are not uniform across all cell types of the brain, an efficient system is necessary for the transport of cholesterol, and probably other lipids, among cells of the CNS. In the CNS, as in the periphery, cholesterol exchange between cells is mediated by lipoproteins. Lipoproteins in the CNS are derived from glia (astrocytes and microglia), which synthesize and secrete apolipoprotein (apo) E and apoJ (5.LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A.

Patel Y.C. McConathy W.J. Patel R.C. Suresh S. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unlike the plasma, in which apoA1 is the most abundant apolipoprotein, apoE is the major apolipoprotein in the CNS (9.Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M. Stuerenburg H.J. Buhmann C. Beisiegel U.

Chem. 2004; 279: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Glial lipoproteins have been proposed to be taken up by axons of neighboring neurons so that the lipids, particularly cholesterol, can be used in membranes during axon repair or remodeling (15.Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). The importance of cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS is underscored by the link between disturbances in CNS cholesterol metabolism and several neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick disease type C and Alzheimer's disease (reviewed in Ref. 16.Vance J.E. Hayashi H. Karten B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 193-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Moreover, imbalances in cholesterol homeostasis in the CNS have been proposed to cause synaptic dysfunction (17.Koudinov A.R. Koudinova N.V. J. Neurol. Sci. 2005; 229–230: 233-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Glial lipoproteins are thought to be formed by two poorly characterized processes: the direct secretion of lipidated apolipoproteins, and the efflux of lipids from glial cells to lipid-free or lipid-poor extracellular apolipoproteins. Lipoprotein particles in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid are the size and density of plasma high density lipoproteins (HDLs) (reviewed in Refs. 9.Koch S. Donarski N. Goetze K. Kreckel M.

Whereas all apoE in the CNS is derived from cells within the CNS, some plasma apoA1 crosses the blood-brain barrier by an unknown mechanism (19.Pitas R.E. Boyles J.K. Lee S.H. Hui D. Weisgraber K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14352-14360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is incorporated into CNS lipoproteins. ApoA1 is also synthesized by endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (20.Mockel B. Zinke H. Flach R. Weiss B. Weiler-Guttler H. Gassen H.G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21.Panzenboeck U. Balazs Z. Sovic A. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Wintersperger A. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol.

Nascent discoidal lipoproteins are transformed into spherical particles in cerebrospinal fluid by the action of lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (5.LaDu M.J. Gilligan S.M. Lukens J.R. Cabana V.G. Reardon C.A. Van Eldik L.J. Holtzman D.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2070-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Lipid efflux from cells to apolipoproteins is thought to be mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. During HDL formation in the plasma ABCA1 is required for transferring phospholipids and/or cholesterol to lipid-free, or lipid-poor, apoA1 (reviewed in Ref. 22.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the role of ABC transporters in brain lipid metabolism is incompletely understood. The expression of ABCA1 in several cell types increases in response to an increased cellular concentration of cholesterol and/or oxysterols through activation of the transcription factor, liver X receptor (LXR) (reviewed in Ref. 22.Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other ABC transporters, such as the half-transporter ABCG1, have also been proposed to play a role in the generation of plasma lipoproteins (reviewed in Refs. 23.Schmitz G. Langmann T. Heimerl S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1513-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 24.Ito T. Drug News Perspect. 2003; 16: 490-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the mechanism of formation of plasma HDL indicate that ABCA1 mediates an initial lipidation of lipid-poor or lipid-free apoA1, whereas ABCG1 is responsible for the further lipidation of particles that have been partially lipidated by ABCA1 (25.Wang N. Lan D. Chen W. Matsuura F. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9774-9779Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 26.Nakamura K. Kennedy M.A. Baldan A. Bojanic D.D. Lyons K.

Frank J. Francone O.L. Edwards P.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 121-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Because both ABCA1 and ABCG1 are expressed in the brain, a key determinant of the lipoprotein population in the CNS is likely to be the lipidation of apoE (synthesized by glia) and apoA1 (derived from the plasma) mediated by one or more of these transporters. Recently, the secretion and lipidation of apoE by astrocytes were shown to depend, at least in part, on ABCA1 (28.Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H. Cohn J.S. Hayden M.R. Wellington C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41197-41207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 29.Wahrle S.E. Jiang H. Parsadanian M.

However, these studies revealed that astrocytes and microglia also operate pathways for the release of cholesterol to apoE that are independent of ABCA1 (28.Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A. Chan J.Y. Tansley G.H. Cohn J.S. Hayden M.R. Wellington C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41197-41207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The currently emerging model for the formation of plasma HDL is that apoA1 and apoE bind to ABCA1 (30.Oram J.F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 720-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 31.Lee J.Y. Parks J.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 32.Remaley A.T. Stonik J.A.

Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), most likely via a direct protein-protein interaction that results in the transfer of phospholipids and cholesterol from cells to the acceptor apolipoprotein. Once apoE associates with lipids, however, the ability of ABCA1 to interact with apoE is reduced (33.Krimbou L. Denis M. Haidar B. Carrier M. Marcil M. Genest Jr., J. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 839-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These findings support the idea that ABCA1 is responsible for the initial lipidation of apoA1/apoE, whereas another mechanism, perhaps involving ABCG1, provides additional lipids for complete lipidation of the particle. To gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in lipoprotein formation in the CNS, we have investigated the regulation of expression of three key components of lipoprotein formation by cerebellar astroglia, apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1, in relation to cholesterol release. Our data demonstrate that the expression of apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 in astroglia is differentially regulated by cholesterol and that cholesterol efflux from cerebellar astroglia, in contrast to peripheral cells, does not correlate with the expression of ABCA1. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and phospholipase C (from Clostridium welchii) were purchased from Sigma. DNase I was from Cedarlane (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). All other materials for cell culture and PCR were from Invitrogen. Cholesterol was purchased from Sigma. Supplies for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). The LXR agonist TO901317 was from Key Organics (Camelford, UK). The inhibitor of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase Sandoz 58-035 was purchased from Sigma. Nile Red was from Invitrogen Molecular Probes (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). [1-14C]Acetic acid (57 mCi/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences. Silica gel G60 thin-layer chromatography plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). A rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antibody, that recognizes mouse ABCA1, was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO) and the goat anti-human apoE antibody that recognizes mouse apoE was from Biodesign (Saco, ME). A rabbit polyclonal anti-dog calnexin antibody was obtained from Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Human apoA1 and human low density lipoproteins (LDLs) were isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and were a generous gift from Dr. G. Francis (University of Alberta). Cell Culture—Primary cerebellar astroglia were cultured as described previously (34.Karten B. Hayashi H. Francis G.A. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, cerebella were dissected from 1- to 2-day-old Balb/cCr/AltBM or B6.129P2-Apoetm1Unc mice (stock 002052, Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME). Meninges and surface blood vessels were removed and discarded, and then the tissue was finely chopped, briefly digested with trypsin and DNase I, and dissociated by gentle trituration through a Pasteur pipette. Cells were plated in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum at a density of one cerebellum per 25-mm2 flask. Upon reaching confluence (∼7 days after plating) the cells were washed three times with PBS, trypsinized, and replated at a density of 1:3. All experiments were performed with confluent cells. Under these conditions, 90–95% of cells were astroglia as assessed by immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acidic protein (34.Karten B. Hayashi H. Francis G.A. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 779-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All procedures were approved by the Health Sciences Animal Welfare Committee of the University of Alberta. Immunoblotting—Glial cells were scraped into PBS then pelleted by centrifugation at 16,500 × g for 2 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and sonicated for 3 s. For immunoblotting of ABCA1, proteins were resolved on 7% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS under reducing conditions, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antibody (dilution 1:1,000). Immunoreactive proteins were detected by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:10,000) and visualized with ECL reagent (ECL Western blotting System, Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting for apoE was performed after separation of proteins on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS. The membranes were probed with goat anti-human apoE antibody (dilution 1:2,500), and immunoreactive proteins were detected by reaction with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (dilution 1:10,000) and ECL reagent. Isolation of Glia-conditioned Medium—Confluent glia were incubated with or without LDL (0.1 mg of protein/ml) in serum-free DMEM for 24 h, then washed three times with PBS. Serum-free DMEM, containing or lacking 10 μg/ml apoA1, was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 3 days. Medium was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove cell debris. The supernatant (glia-conditioned medium) was used for immunoblotting, cholesterol analysis by gas-liquid chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over a gel-filtration column, as indicated. Efflux of Endogenously Synthesized Cholesterol—Upon reaching ∼60% confluency, glial cells were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [14C]sodium acetate in DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum for ∼3 days until confluency was attained. The cellular concentration of cholesterol was then raised by incubation of glia for 24 h in serum-free DMEM with or without 30 μg/ml cholesterol (added from a 10 mg/ml stock solution in ethanol) in the absence of radiolabel to minimize the presence of radiolabeled cholesterol precursors. In some experiments, glia were incubated with the LXR agonist TO901317 (2 μm) for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with PBS then incubated in serum-free DMEM, with or without 10 μg/ml apoA1, for 24 h. Medium was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove cell debris. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and cellular lipids were extracted into hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v). Cellular protein was dissolved in 0.3 n NaOH and analyzed using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Lipid Analyses—Medium from radiolabeling experiments was extracted twice with hexane/isopropanol (3:2, v/v). Lipid extracts from medium and cells were separated by thin-layer chromatography in heptane/di-isopropyl ether/acetic acid, 65:35:4 (v/v). The band corresponding to unesterified cholesterol was scraped, and radioactivity was measured. Lipids in the medium from experiments without radioactivity were extracted twice with hexane. The lipid extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen then silylated with N,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide/1% trimethylsilane in acetone and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography using 5-α-cholestane as internal standard. Cellular lipids were incubated with phospholipase C to hydrolyze the phospholipids, extracted into hexane/diethyl ether (2:1), silylated with N,O-bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide/1% trimethylsilane in acetone, and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Visualization of Neutral Lipids with Nile Red—Glia were grown to confluency in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were then incubated in serum-free DMEM with or without 30 μg/ml cholesterol for 24 h, washed three times with PBS, and fixed for 15 min in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS. The cells were permeabilized by treatment for 20 min with 50 μg/ml saponin in PBS and then stained with Nile Red (0.1 μg/ml in PBS) for 10 min. The cells were washed and examined in a Leica DM IRE2 digital microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with an N PLAN L 20×/0.40 objective and a Leica ebq100 fluorescence lamp. Lipoprotein Size—The size of glia-derived lipoprotein particles was evaluated by fast protein liquid chromatography. Glia-conditioned medium was concentrated 50-fold using an Amicon Ultra Filter (30-kDa molecular mass cut-off) and applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to a Beckman Systems Gold or Nouveau Gold apparatus. The cholesterol content of the eluate was monitored by an in-line detection assay (Infinity Cholesterol Reagent, Sigma). RNA Isolation and Real-time qPCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured glia by extraction with TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 1.5 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT)12–18 random primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time qPCR was performed using Platinum® Quantitation PCR supermix (Invitrogen), SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), and intron-spanning, gene-specific oligonucleotides (250 nm of each primer) in a total volume of 25 μl. Transcripts were detected by real-time qPCR with a Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Montreal Biotech, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Data were analyzed using the Rotor-Gene 6.0.19 program. A standard curve was used to calculate mRNA level relative to that of a control gene, cyclophilin. The specificity of products was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequence analysis. All primers were synthesized at the DNA Core Facility of the University of Alberta with sequences as follows: cyclophilin, 5′-TCC AAA GAC AGC AGA AAA CTT TCG (sense), 5′-TCT TCT TGC TGG TCT TGC CAT TCC (antisense); ABCA1, 5′-TTG GAT GGA TTA GAT TGG AC (sense), 5′-ATG CCT GTG AAC ACG ATG (antisense); ABCG1, 5′-TGA CAC ATC TGC GAA TCA C (sense), 5′-AGG GGA AAG GTC AGA ACA (antisense). Determination of the Cellular Distribution of ABCA1—The partitioning of ABCA1 between the cell surface and intracellular membranes was assessed by biotinylation of surface proteins. Confluent glia were incubated with 30 μg/ml cholesterol or 2 μm TO901317 in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. Surface proteins were biotinylated using the Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation and Purification Kit from Pierce. Briefly, surface proteins were biotinylated then cells were harvested and lysed. Biotinylated proteins were isolated by passage of the cell lysate over a streptavidin column. Proteins that bound to the streptavidin column (i.e. biotinylated surface proteins) and proteins that did not bind to the streptavidin column (i.e. non-plasma membrane proteins) were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and analyzed for ABCA1 by immunoblotting. Calnexin was used as a negative control to demonstrate the lack of contamination of the cell-surface fraction with intracellular proteins. Statistical Analyses—Statistical significance of differences (p < 0.05) was determined by the Student's t test. Cholesterol Loading of Astroglia Increases Cholesterol Efflux to Exogenous ApoA1—Astroglia release cholesterol in the form of apoE-containing lipoproteins in the absence of any exogenously added apolipoprotein acceptor. Astroglia can also release cholesterol to extracellular acceptors such as apoA1 in a process mediated by ABC transporters (28.Hirsch-Reinshagen V. Zhou S. Burgess B.L. Bernier L. McIsaac S.A.

To examine cholesterol efflux mediated by ABC transporters, we measured cholesterol output into the medium of cerebellar glial cells in the absence and presence of apoA1. We also investigated cholesterol efflux from glia in which the intracellular cholesterol content had been raised by pre-treatment with cholesterol, because cholesterol loading of fibroblasts is known to increase ABCA1 expression (35.Langmann T.

A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Using this protocol for enrichment of glia with cholesterol, the cholesterol content of the glia increased from 39.9 ± 7.2 μg/mg of protein to 115.5 ± 6.2 μg/mg of protein. As shown in Fig. 1A, the efflux of cholesterol synthesized endogenously from [14C]acetate was not increased by the addition of apoA1 alone, or by cholesterol loading alone. However, when glia were enriched with cholesterol, apoA1 promoted [14C]cholesterol efflux. We also measured the mass of cholesterol in the culture medium, because the amount of radiolabeled cholesterol in the medium does not necessarily reflect cholesterol mass. In these experiments, as an alternative method for increasing the cholesterol content, glia were preincubated for 24 h in serum-free medium containing low density lipoproteins (LDL), which increased the cholesterol content of the glia from 39.9 ± 7.2 μg/mg of protein to 57.3 ± 6.0 μg/mg of protein. The cholesterol-enriched cells were incubated for 3 days in serum- and LDL-free medium, containing or lacking apoA1, and the amount of cholesterol in cells and medium was determined (Fig. 1B). A longer conditioning period, compared with that used for the experiments in Fig. 1A, was necessary to attain sufficient cholesterol concentrations in the medium for analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 1A, the release of cholesterol was enhanced only when the cholesterol content of the cells was increased and, in addition, apoA1 was added exogenously (Fig. 1B). The amount of apoE in the medium was not changed by these treatments (Fig. 1C). Cholesterol Efflux to Exogenous ApoA1 Is Not Increased by the LXR Agonist TO901317—LXR agonists increase the expression of ABCA1 and other ABC transporters in fibroblasts and macrophages (37.Schwartz K.

In the following experiments, we determined whether or not the LXR agonist, TO901317, also stimulated cholesterol efflux from astroglia. Surprisingly, treatment of glia with TO901317 did not increase the efflux of either radiolabeled cholesterol (Fig. 2A), or cholesterol mass (Fig. 2B). Nor did a combination of apoA1 and TO90137 increase cholesterol efflux (Fig. 2, A and B). Fig. 2C shows that apoE secretion was independent of the presence of apoA1, whereas the LXR agonist (2 μm) did increase apoE secretion. Treatment of glia with a higher concentration of TO901317 (10 μm) also failed to stimulate cholesterol efflux but increased apoE secretion to a greater extent than did 2 μm TO90137 (not shown). Thus, in cerebellar glia, in contrast to other types of cells, the LXR agonist TO"
https://openalex.org/W1965506486,"Microsomal TG transfer protein (MTTP) is required for the assembly and secretion of TG (TG)-rich lipoproteins from both enterocytes and hepatocytes. Liver-specific deletion of <i>Mttp</i> produced a dramatic reduction in plasma very low density lipoprotein-TG and virtually eliminated apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) secretion yet caused only modest reductions in plasma apoB48 and apoB48 secretion from primary hepatocytes. These observations prompted us to examine the phenotype following intestine-specific <i>Mttp</i> deletion because murine, like human enterocytes, secrete virtually exclusively apoB48. We generated mice with conditional <i>Mttp</i> deletion in villus enterocytes (<i>Mttp</i>-IKO), using a tamoxifen-inducible, intestine-specific Cre transgene. Villus enterocytes from chow-fed <i>Mttp</i>-IKO mice contained large cytoplasmic TG droplets and no chylomicron-sized particles within the secretory pathway. Chow-fed, <i>Mttp</i>-IKO mice manifested steatorrhea, growth arrest, and decreased cholesterol absorption, features that collectively recapitulate the phenotype associated with abetalipoproteinemia. Chylomicron secretion was reduced dramatically <i>in vivo</i>, in conjunction with an ∼80% decrease in apoB48 secretion from primary enterocytes. Additionally, although plasma and hepatic cholesterol and TG content were decreased, <i>Mttp</i>-IKO mice demonstrated a paradoxical increase in both hepatic lipogenesis and very low density lipoprotein secretion. These findings establish distinctive features for MTTP involvement in intestinal chylomicron assembly and secretion and suggest that hepatic lipogenesis undergoes compensatory induction in the face of defective intestinal TG secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2089999198,"Here we described novel interactions of the mammalian selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) with nitroaromatic environmental pollutants and drugs. We found that TrxR could catalyze nitroreductase reactions with either one- or two-electron reduction, using its selenocysteine-containing active site and another redox active center, presumably the FAD. Tetryl and p-dinitrobenzene were the most efficient nitroaromatic substrates with a kcat of 1.8 and 2.8 s–1, respectively, at pH 7.0 and 25 °C using 50 μM NADPH. As a nitroreductase, TrxR cycled between four- and two-electron-reduced states. The one-electron reactions led to superoxide formation as detected by cytochrome c reduction and, interestingly, reductive N-denitration of tetryl or 2,4-dinitrophenyl-N-methylnitramine, resulting in the release of nitrite. Most nitroaromatics were uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors with regard to NADPH and the disulfide substrate 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), respectively. Tetryl and 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan were, however, competitive inhibitors with respect to 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and were clearly substrates for the selenolthiol motif of the enzyme. Furthermore, tetryl and 4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan efficiently inactivated TrxR, likely by alkylation of the selenolthiol motif as in the inhibition of TrxR by 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene/dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) or juglone. The latter compounds were the most efficient inhibitors of TrxR activity in a cellular context. DNCB, juglone, and tetryl were highly cytotoxic and induced caspase-3/7 activation in HeLa cells. Furthermore, DNCB and juglone were potent inducers of apoptosis also in Bcl2 overexpressing HeLa cells or in A549 cells. Based on these findings, we suggested that targeting of intracellular TrxR by alkylating nitroaromatic or quinone compounds may contribute to the induction of apoptosis in exposed human cancer cells.

The three-dimensional structure of mammalian TrxR is similar to that of glutathione reductase, including conserved FAD- and NADP(H)-binding domains, but TrxR has a 16-residue C-terminal extension carrying a catalytic Cys-497/Sec-498 couple that is easily accessible for substrates of the enzyme while shielding its glutathione reductase-like active site disulfide (11Biterova E.I.

In the catalytic cycle, NADPH first reduces FAD, which passes redox equivalents to the redox active disulfide, located within a conserved -CVNVGC-sequence, with formation of a dithiol. Subsequently, this dithiol reduces the selenenylsulfide located at the C-terminal end of the other subunit in the dimeric enzyme (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H.

This formed selenolthiol motif reduces the active site disulfide of Trx, the disulfide of the synthetic model substrate, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB), or any of the many other substrates of the enzyme, such as lipoic acid, selenite, and several quinone compounds; the wide substrate specificity of mammalian TrxR is attributed to the easy access and reductive capacity of the C-terminal selenolthiol (1Arnér E.S.J.

Because of the presence of three two-electron accepting redox centers, TrxR may exist in two-, four-, and six-electron-reduced states with distinct spectral properties (7Arscott L.D. Gromer S.

It is believed that during Trx reduction, mammalian TrxR cycles between two- (EH2) and four-electron (EH4)-reduced states, with two or four electrons shared mainly between catalytic disulfide and the selenenylsulfide motif (9Zhong L.

One is the wide variety of the antioxidant actions of the enzyme, because in addition to thioredoxin, TrxR reduces hydroperoxides and regenerates some antioxidants, e.g. lipoate, various selenium compounds, and ubiquinone (2Nordberg J.

The modification of SeCys-498 and Cys-497 by the nitroaromatic compound 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB/CDNB) inactivates TrxR and enhances its superoxide-producing NADPH-oxidase activity, thus conferring pro-oxidant properties to the enzyme (2Nordberg J. Arnér E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Certain quinones, reduced by TrxR to easily auto-oxidizing hydroquinones, may also inactivate and at the same time confer pro-oxidant functions to TrxR (15Cenas N. Nivinskas H. Anusevicius Z.

In this context, we believed that a possible interaction of TrxR with different classes of nitroaromatic compounds that represent a widespread group of drugs and environmental pollutants should be of significant interest. The cytotoxic, antitumor, and antiparasitic activities of nitroaromatics are generally believed to stem mainly from the redox cycling of their free radicals formed after single-electron reduction by different flavoenzymes or from the alkylation of DNA and/or other cellular nucleophiles by the products of their two (or four)-electron reduction, the arylhydroxylamines (27Wardman P.

It has been shown previously that enzymes analogous to TrxR, such as the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide reductases trypanothione reductase and glutathione reductase, may reduce nitroaromatics and produce redox cycling radicals, although at quite low rates (31Cenas N.

The possible interaction of mammalian TrxR with nitroaromatics, except for the targeting of the Sec residue by dinitrohalobenzenes (2Nordberg J. Arnér E.S.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar), has not been studied to date. Here we examined the interactions of recombinant rat TrxR with a number of structurally diverse nitroaromatics, including the antitumor agents chinifur and nitracrine (36Rossa M.M. Rocha-e-Silva T.A. Terruggi C.H. Tedesco A.C. Selistre-de-Araujo H.S. Borissevich I.E. Degterev I.A. Pharmacol.

We found that TrxR has a significant nitroreductase activity with some nitroaromatic compounds, that it may catalyze reductive N-denitration reactions, and that the enzyme concomitantly can be inhibited for its normal disulfide reductase activity. Considering the important cellular functions of TrxR and the direct apoptosis induction that may be provoked by selenium-compromised forms of the enzyme (21Anestål K. Arnér E.S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15966-15972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we also studied the cytotoxic actions of some of the nitroaromatics and compared it with that of the most potent TrxR-interacting quinone, juglone (15Cenas N.

We found that tetryl, DNCB, and juglone may induce a pronounced cytotoxicity. Most interestingly, studying caspase-mediated apoptosis in HeLa cells, HeLa cells overexpressing Bcl2, and A549 cells, we found that tetryl had a similar profile in apoptotic induction as the classical apoptosis-inducer staurosporine, whereas DNCB or juglone provoked an apoptosis with a completely different profile that we propose may be intimately linked to their interactions with TrxR. Enzymes and Reagents—Recombinant mammalian TrxR was prepared as described (39Rengby O. Johansson L. Carlson L.A. Serini E. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Kårsnäs P. Arnér E.S.J. Appl. Environ.

The enzyme concentration was determined according to the absorbance of FAD, ∈463 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1, and the specific activity in the standard DTNB assay (39Rengby O. Johansson L. Carlson L.A.

DEVD-AMC was purchased from the Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan. NADPH, cytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and gold thioglucose were obtained from Sigma and were used without additional purification. Chinifur (2-(5′-nitro(furo-2′-yl)ethene-4-(N,N′-diethylamino)-1-methylbut-1-ylaminocarbonyl-4-quinoline), TNT, tetryl (2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-N-methylnitroamine), DNBF (4,6-dinitrobenzofuroxan) (Fig. 1), 2,4-dinitrophenyl-N-methylnitroamine, and 4-nitrophenyl-N-methylnitroamine were synthesized according to established procedures (33Miskiniene V.

Nitracrine (9-(3-dimethylaminopropylamino)-1-nitroacridine) (Fig. 1) was a generous gift of Professor Igor Degterev (Institute of Chemical Physics, Moscow, Russia). Other nitroaromatic compounds were obtained from Sigma and used without additional purification. Experimental Procedures—All in vitro experiments were carried out in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer solution, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, at 25 °C. Rapid reaction studies were performed under aerobic conditions using a DX.17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics). Steady-state reaction rates were monitored using a Hitachi-557 spectrophotometer. The rate of reduction of DTNB (0.20–2.0 mm) by TrxR in the presence 10–100 μm NADPH was monitored following an increase in absorbance at 412 nm (Δ∈412 = 13.6 mm–1 cm–1 for the thionitrobenzoate anion) and considering that 1 mol NADPH results in the formation of 2 mol thionitrobenzoate. Reduction of nitroaromatics reflecting the nitroreductase reaction of TrxR was monitored following the rate of NADPH (50 μm) oxidation (Δ∈340 = 6.2 mm–1cm–1) in the presence of nitroaromatic substrates. In certain cases, the rates were corrected for the changes in absorbance of nitroaromatics at 340 nm, calculated according to their reduction data in the presence of an NADPH-regeneration system, i.e. 20 μm NADPH, 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 10 units/mg glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. For detection of nitroaromatic-mediated reduction of cytochrome c, 50 μm cytochrome c was added into the reaction mixture, and its reduction was monitored at 550 nm (Δ∈550 = 20 mm–1 cm–1), with the direct reduction of cytochrome c by TrxR subtracted. Kinetic parameters, the catalytic constant (kcat), and the bimolecular rate constant (kcat/Km) correspond to the reciprocal intercepts and slopes of the Lineweaver-Burk plots, [E]/v versus 1/[S], where v is the initial reaction rate, and [E] and [S] are the enzyme and substrate concentrations, respectively. kcat corresponds to molecules of NADPH oxidized by enzyme active site/s. The concentrations of nitrite formed were determined spectrophotometrically at 540 nm, monitoring the formation of azo dye in the presence of sulfanilamide, naphthylethylene diamine hydrochloride, and 4-fold diluted reaction mixture (41Cenas N. Nemeikaite-Ceniene A. Sergediene E. Nivinskas H. Anusevicius Z. Sarlauskas J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 10–100 μm NaNO2 solutions were used for calibration. The in vitro TrxR inhibition experiments were performed in three different ways. In the studies of reversible inhibition, the substrates (NADPH and DTNB) and the inhibitor were introduced into the spectrophotometer cell first, whereupon the reaction was started by TrxR addition. The inhibition constants were calculated from the reaction initial rates using Cleland plots, plotting the dependence of reciprocal kcat/Km values of variable substrate on inhibitor concentration (Ki(slopes)) or the dependence of plot intercept with the y axis on inhibitor concentration (Ki(intercepts)). In the inhibition experiments using gold thioglucose as a known irreversible inhibitor, TrxR (6.0 μm) was incubated in the presence of gold thioglucose (20 μm) and NADPH (200 μm) for 20 min at 25 °C, whereupon an aliquot of enzyme was introduced into a spectrophotometer cell (factor of dilution, 100), and the rate of nitroreductase reaction was determined as described above. Finally, inactivation of the TrxR disulfide reductase activity by nitroaromatics was studied monitoring the time course of reduction of DTNB (0.5–2.0 mm) by NADPH (50 μm) and TrxR (30 nm) in the presence of nitroaromatic compounds. The kinetic progress curves for the first 4 min upon addition of TrxR were linearized in coordinates 1/ΔA412 versus 1/t, the line intersection with the x axis giving the reciprocal first-order apparent inactivation rate constant, ki(app) (43Berezin I.V. Klyosov A.A. Practical Course of Chemical and Enzymatic Kinetics. Moscow University, Moscow1976Google Scholar). The obtained inactivation rate constants were corrected for the ki(app) of TrxR in the absence of nitroaromatics, found in this assay to be about 0.1–0.12 min–1. Cell Culture—A549 cells and wild-type HeLa cells were purchased from the ATCC. HeLa cells stably overexpressing Bcl2 were kindly provided by Dr. Bengt Fadeel (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from PAA Laboratories, Germany) at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 and maintained in a logarithmic growth phase for all experiments. Enzyme Activity in Cell Lysates—1.5 × 106 cells were seeded per plate (65 cm2) in 5 ml of medium, treated 4 h with the indicated compounds, harvested, and washed. The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in cell extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) followed by four freeze/thaw cycles. The cell extract was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g 5 min, after which the supernatant was used"
https://openalex.org/W2137997688,"The initial selectin-dependent events that mediate tumor cell tethering to platelets, leukocytes, and vascular endothelium can regulate the extravasation and colonization of metastatic cells into distant tissues. Little is known, however, about the identity of selectin counter-receptors on tumor cells, which facilitate the metastatic process. To address this issue, we performed SDS-PAGE analysis of membrane proteins, metabolic inhibition studies, blot rolling assays, and cell-free flow-based adhesion experiments using microbeads coated with CD44 immunoprecipitated from carcinomas and purified selectins as substrate. Here, we demonstrate that variant isoforms of CD44 (CD44v) on LS174T colon carcinoma cells possess P-/L-/E-selectin binding activity, in contrast to the standard isoform of CD44 (CD44s) on hematopoietic-progenitor cells (HPCs), which is primarily an L-/E-selectin ligand. Moreover, the selectin-binding determinants on CD44v from LS174T cells are sialofucosylated structures displayed on O-linked glycans, akin to those on P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, but distinct from the HECA-452-reactive N-glycans on CD44s expressed on HPCs. Using flow-based adhesion assays, we systematically characterize shear-dependent LS174T CD44 vs. HL60 CD44s adhesion to E-/P-/L-selectin. The novel finding that CD44v are selectin ligands offers a unifying perspective on the apparent enhanced metastatic potential associated with tumor cell CD44v overexpression and the critical role of selectins in metastasis."

Here we report the isolation and characterization of hepatitis C virus RNA replicons resistant to a novel ketoamide inhibitor of the NS3/4A protease, SCH6 (originally SCH446211). Resistant replicon RNAs were generated by G418 selection in the presence of SCH6 in a dose-dependent fashion, with the emergence of resistance reduced at higher SCH6 concentrations. Sequencing demonstrated remarkable consistency in the mutations conferring SCH6 resistance in genotype 1b replicons derived from two different strains of hepatitis C virus, A156T/A156V and R109K. R109K, a novel mutation not reported previously to cause resistance to NS3/4A inhibitors, conferred moderate resistance only to SCH6. Structural analysis indicated that this reflects unique interactions of SCH6 with P′-side residues in the protease active site. In contrast, A156T conferred high level resistance to SCH6 and a related ketoamide, SCH503034, as well as BILN 2061 and VX-950. Unlike R109K, which had minimal impact on NS3/4A enzymatic function, A156T significantly reduced NS3/4A catalytic efficiency, polyprotein processing, and replicon fitness. However, three separate second-site mutations, P89L, Q86R, and G162R, were capable of partially reversing A156T-associated defects in polyprotein processing and/or replicon fitness, without significantly reducing resistance to the protease inhibitor.

During the emergence of escape variants, pre-existing minor viral species, resistant to the selecting drug, will gain a growth advantage over the existing wild-type viral population and rapidly become the dominant genotype. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients treated with protease inhibitors, resistant viruses have been isolated and shown to correlate with breakthrough viral replication. Resistance can also be developed by selecting a virus with protease inhibitors in vitro, and in many cases the mutations that confer resistance in vitro are the same as those observed clinically (for review see Refs. 5Johnson V.A.

Much research has been directed toward finding inhibitors of the nonstructural proteins of HCV that contribute to the viral RNA replicase complex. The N-terminal third of NS3 is a serine protease involved in the cis-processing of the HCV polyprotein at the NS3-NS4A junction. NS3 assembles as a noncovalent complex with NS4A to form the mature protease responsible for the further processing of the nonstructural proteins at the NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A and NS5A-NS5B junctions (for review see Ref. 7Reed K.E.

We show that mutation of Arg-109 leads to moderate resistance against SCH6 but not other inhibitors of the NS3 protease, reflecting novel interactions of SCH6 with P′-side residues in the protease active site. In contrast, mutation of Ala-156 results in broad resistance against NS3/4A inhibitors from multiple chemical classes but at a significant cost in terms of catalytic activity and replication fitness. This loss of fitness, however, is partially restored by second-site mutations within the NS3. Control Cells and Subgenomic HCV Replicon Lines—The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 (16Nakabayashi H. Taketa K. Miyano K. Yamane T. Sato J. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 3858-3863PubMed Google Scholar) was grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids, 10 mm HEPES, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. En5-3 cells, a clonal cell line derived from Huh7 cells by stable transformation with the plasmid pLTR-SEAP (17Yi M. Bodola F. Lemon S.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum but without nonessential amino acids, additional sodium bicarbonate, or HEPES and with the addition of 2 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen). Cell lines containing HCV replicons were cultured in 0.4-0.5 mg/ml G418, except for clone 16 for which 1 mg/ml G418 was used. The HCV replicon cell lines used in these studies contained autonomously replicating, selectable dicistronic, and subgenomic RNAs (18Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar) derived from two different genotype 1b strains of virus. The Con1 replicon used to select the Huh7-derived cell line, 2H8 1.3, was identical to that described by Lohmann et al. (18Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), except for the presence of a cell culture-adaptive mutation, S233I, within the NS5A sequence (19Blight K.J. Kolykhalov A.A. Rice C.M. Science. 2000; 290: 1972-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). The replicon in the stably selected 2H8 1.3 cell line also contains a spontaneously acquired adaptive mutation E176G in NS3, as discussed below. We also used an additional replicon cell line for selection of SCH6-resistant mutants, Ntat2ANeo/EG. This was established using En5-3 cells and contains a modified subgenomic replicon derived from the HCV-N strain of HCV that expresses the HIV Tat protein, in addition to neomycin phosphotransferase, from its upstream cistron (17Yi M. Bodola F. Lemon S.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This replicon also carries the NS3 adaptive mutation E176G. The expression of Tat by Ntat2ANeo/EG drives the expression and secretion of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in transfected En5-3 cells in a manner that correlates closely with the intracellular abundance of the viral RNA. Thus, measurement of SEAP activity in the supernatant fluids of Ntat2ANeo/EG cells allows real time estimates of the intracellular abundance of replicon RNA (17Yi M. Bodola F. Lemon S.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Bourne N. Pyles R.B. Yi M. Veselenak R.L. Davis M.M. Lemon S.M. Antiviral Res. 2005; 67: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For transient replication assays, we used the replicon pNtat2ANeo/EG/SI, which is identical to pNtat2ANeo/EG but also contains the S233I adaptive mutation in NS5A. Selection of Replicons with Primary SCH6 Resistance Mutations and Second-site Compensatory Mutations—To select replicon cell lines resistant to SCH6, replicon-bearing cells (1-2 × 105) were plated in a 10-cm dish and cultured with 2.5, 0.5, 0.1, or 0 μm (2H8 1.3 cells) or 2 or 0 μm SCH6 (Ntat2ANeo/EG cells), in addition to G418. All cells were passed once at a 1:10 ratio once they became confluent. Surviving colonies resistant to both inhibitor and antibiotic were selected and expanded for further analysis. To select additional mutations that might facilitate replication of the HCV-N A156T mutant (see “Results”), in vitro transcribed RNA (see below) derived from the Ntat2ANeo/EG/SI replicon engineered to contain the NS3 A156T mutation was electroporated into En5-3 cells, and cell colonies were selected in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. RNA isolated from selected clonal cells was subjected to direct sequencing analysis, as described below. Evaluation of Inhibitor Resistance—HCV-N replicons selected for resistance to SCH6 were tested for sensitivity to NS3/4A inhibitors, and the results were analyzed as described previously (20Bourne N. Pyles R.B. Yi M. Veselenak R.L. Davis M.M. Lemon S.M. Antiviral Res. 2005; 67: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the Con1 replicons, cells were seeded at 4000 cells/well in 96-well collagen I-coated Biocoat plates (BD Biosciences). Twenty four hours post-seeding, protease inhibitors were added to replicon cells. The final concentration of Me2SO was 0.5%, fetal bovine serum was 5%, and G418 was 500 μg/ml. Media and inhibitors were refreshed daily for 3 days, and cells were harvested by lysis in 1× cell lysis buffer (Ambion catalog number 8721). The replicon RNA abundance was measured by quantitative, multiplex RT-PCR (Taqman) assay with the following NS5B PCR primers: 5B.2 forward, ATGGACAGGCGCCCTGA, and 5B.2 reverse, TTGATGGGCAGCTTGGTTTC, with a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe, CACGCCATGCGCTGCGG. As with the HCV-N replicons (20Bourne N. Pyles R.B. Yi M. Veselenak R.L. Davis M.M. Lemon S.M. Antiviral Res. 2005; 67: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the endogenous control was GAPDH mRNA. The real time RT-PCRs were run on the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system using the following program: 48 °C for 30 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min. The ΔCT values (CT5B - CTGAPDH) were plotted against inhibitor concentration and fitted to the sigmoid dose-response model using SAS (SAS Institute Inc.) or PRISM software (Graphpad Software Inc.). IC50 was the inhibitor concentration necessary to achieve an increase of 1 in the ΔCT over the projected base line. IC90 was the inhibitor concentration necessary to achieve an increase of 3.2 over the base line. Replicon Sequence Analysis—To identify mutations that conferred resistance to SCH6, total cellular RNA was isolated from selected replicon cells and amplified by RT-PCR as described (21Yi M. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 7904-7915Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced. Alternatively, replicon cell-derived RT-PCR products were cloned into TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen), and plasmid DNA from multiple bacterial colonies was sequenced. The sequences were aligned using Lasergene software (DNASTAR). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To generate mutant protease expression vectors and mutant replicon constructs carrying individual resistance mutations, nucleotide changes were introduced into plasmid DNA using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The parental plasmid expressing His-tagged single chain NS3 protease domain, NS4A21-32-GSGS-NS33-181 (plasmid p24), was described by Taremi et al. (22Taremi S.S. Beyer B. Maher M. Yao N. Prosise W. Weber P.C. Malcolm B.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). For mutational analysis of HCV-N replicons in transient replication assays, the parental construct was pNtat2ANeo/EG/SI, identical to pNtat2ANeo/EG but containing the NS5A S233I mutation. All segments of the cDNA that were manipulated during site-directed mutagenesis were sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutation and to exclude adventitious changes. Evaluation of Replicon Colony Formation Efficiency (CFE)—5 μg of each replicon RNA was transfected into 5 × 106 Huh7 cells in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Electroporation conditions were 950 microfarads and 250 V in a 0.4-cm cuvette using a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). Cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 for 2-3 weeks until cell colonies were established. One set of the dishes was stained with crystal violet (from Sigma, 0.48 mg/ml in 3% formaldehyde, 30% ethanol, 0.16 mg/ml NaCl), and the numbers of colonies were recorded. The CFE was reported as the number of colonies established/μg of input RNA. Cells from the duplicate set were pooled and expanded for further analysis. Transient Replication Assay—RNAs representing the Ntat2ANeo/EG/SI, with and without SCH6 resistance mutations, were synthesized with T7 MEGAScript reagents (Ambion), after linearizing plasmids with XbaI. Following treatment with RNase-free DNase to remove template DNA and purification using the RNeasy RNA purification kit (Qiagen), the RNA was transfected into En5-3 cells by electroporation. Briefly, 5 μg of RNA was mixed with 2 × 106 cells suspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline in a cuvette with a gap width of 0.2 cm (Bio-Rad). Electroporation was with two pulses of current delivered by the Gene Pulser II electroporation device (Bio-Rad), set at 1.5 kV, 25 microfarads, and maximum resistance. No G418 was added to the media. Transfected cells were transferred to two wells of a 6-well tissue culture plate, and culture medium was removed completely every 24 h and saved at 4 °C for subsequent SEAP assay. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline prior to re-feeding with fresh culture medium. Because the culture medium was replaced every 24 h in these transient assays, the SEAP activity measured in these fluids reflected the daily production of SEAP by the cells. SEAP activity was measured in 10-μl aliquots of the supernatant culture fluids using the Phospha-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay (Tropix) with the manufacturer's suggested protocol reduced in scale. The luminescent signal was read using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Inc.). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Mutant Proteases—The expression and purification protocol has been described in detail (22Taremi S.S. Beyer B. Maher M. Yao N. Prosise W. Weber P.C. Malcolm B.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasmid DNAs encoding mutant proteases were transformed into JM109 or BL21 (DE3) cells. Single colonies were used to initiate bacterial cultures in 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C. When the cell density reached A600 ∼1.5, the culture was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and grown at 23 °C for 4 h. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% β-octyl glucoside, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, or 0.2 mm DTT), and cells were lysed by passing through a microfluidizer (Microfluids Corp). The lysed supernatants were incubated with nickelnitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4°C and then loaded onto columns. The nickel columns were washed with buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole and 1 m NaCl. The bound His-tagged protease was eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted fractions were pooled and dialyzed at 4 °C for 18 h against 50 mm HEPES, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% β-octyl glucoside, and 10% glycerol. The purified proteases were analyzed on 4-12% NOVEX NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and aliquoted for storage at -80 °C. Protease Activity Assay—Recombinant proteases were tested using a chromogenic assay as described by Zhang et al. (23Zhang R. Beyer B.M. Durkin J. Ingram R. Njoroge F.G. Windsor W.T. Malcolm B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The assays were performed at 30 °C in 96-well microtiter plates. 100 μl of protease was added to 100 μl of assay buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 20% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 5 μm EDTA, 5 μm DTT) containing the chromogenic substrate Ac-DTEDVVP(l-norvaline)-O-4-phenylazophenyl ester. The reactions were monitored at an interval of 30 s for 1 h for change in absorbance at 370 nm using a Spectromax Plus microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). To determine the enzyme concentration to be used in the assay, proteases were tested (1.6-100 nm) to achieve ∼12% substrate depletion over the course of the assay. To evaluate kinetic parameters of recombinant proteases, a range of substrate concentrations (0.293-150 μm) was used. Initial velocities were determined using linear regression, and kinetic constants were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using PRISM Software. Turnover rates were then calculated based on enzyme concentration (2-9 nm). To assay potency of SCH6 and VX-950, the inhibition constants were determined at fixed concentrations of enzyme (2-9 nm) and substrate (40 μm) and fitted to the two-step slow-binding inhibition model: p = vst + (v0 - vs)(1 - e-kt)/k of Morrison and Walsh (24Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar) using SAS. The overall inhibition constant Ki*(vs = Vmax S/(Km(1 + I/Ki*))) was used as the measure of inhibitor potency. For BILN 2061, the tight-binding inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated as follows: Ki = (I - E(1 - v/v0))/(v0/v - 1), as described (25Kuzmic P. Sideris S. Cregar L.M. Elrod K.C. Rice K.D. Janc J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 281: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NS3/4A Protease Disruption of IRF-3 Signaling—Huh7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing the wild-type HCV-N NS3-4A segment, with or without SCH6 resistance mutations, a vector expressing an active-site NS3 mutant containing alanine substitutions at residues 138 and 139 (S138AA), or with empty vector, using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Twenty four hours later, cells were transfected with p561Luc, an interferon-stimulated gene 56 (ISG56) promoter luciferase reporter construct, and then infected with Sendai virus ∼8 h later (14Foy E. Li K. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Ikeda M. Lemon S.M. Gale Jr., M. Science. 2003; 300: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 15Li K. Foy E. Ferreon J.C. Nakamura M. Ferreon A.C. Ikeda M. Ray S.C. Gale Jr., M. Lemon S.M. Wang C. Sumpter Jr., R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2992-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested the following day and luciferase activities measured. The promoter stimulation index was calculated as the ratio of luciferase activities present in similarly transfected cells with and without Sendai virus infection. In Vitro Polyprotein Cleavage Assays—In vitro transcribed RNA, prepared as described above, was used to program in vitro translation reactions in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). For analysis of the impact of NS3 mutation on the cis-autoproteolysis of NS3-4A, 1 μg of RNA encoding the NS3-4A sequence was used to program a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μl of [35S]methionine (1,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) and 1 μl of an amino acid mixture lacking methionine. Translation was carried out at 30 °C. Aliquots were removed from the reaction at 20, 30, and 180 min, and SDS sample buffer was added to stop further processing. Translation products were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography or PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. For analysis of trans-cleavage reactions, unlabeled NS3/4A protease was produced in an in vitro translation reaction as above, but using nonradioactive amino acids and allowing translation to continue at 30 °C for 180 min to achieve complete autoproteolysis of NS3-4A (see Fig. 4). A labeled substrate, representing the NS4B-NS5A segment of the polyprotein, was produced by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine, in rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed with the appropriate RNA. The trans-cleavage assay was carried out as described by Back et al. (26Back S.H. Kim J.E. Rho J. Hahm B. Lee T.G. Kim E.E. Cho J.M. Jang S.K. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of the NS3/4A protease and 1 μl of the NS4B-5A substrate were mixed in 25 μl of cleavage buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10 mm DTT, and 0.1% CHAPS). Proteolysis was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 180 min, and samples were analyzed as for the cis-cleavage assay described above. Western Blot Analysis—Cell lysates were separated on 4-12% NOVEX NuPAGE gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen). The NS5A antibody (1126) was a monoclonal antibody provided by Dr. Johnson Y. N. Lau and was used at 1:5000. The Western blot analysis was carried out using the ECF Western blot kit (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were scanned using a PhosphorImager and visualized using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Structural Analysis and Modeling—The crystal structure of the full-length single chain NS3 bifunctional protease-helicase (27Yao N. Reichert P. Taremi S.S. Prosise W.W. Weber P.C. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 1353-1363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) and the co-crystal structure of SCH6 and the NS3 protease domain were used to evaluate the impact of mutations. The x-ray structure of the NS3 protease-SCH6 complex was obtained as described previously (28Arasappan A. Njoroge F.G. Chan T.Y. Bennett F. Bogen S.L. Chen K. Gu H. Hong L. Jao E. Liu Y.T. Lovey R.G.

Point mutations were modeled into the three-dimensional structures using the InsightII molecular modeling program (Accelrys Software Inc., San Diego). Details of the structural analysis will be published elsewhere. 5A. Prongay et al., manuscript in preparation. Generation of HCV Replicon Cells Resistant to SCH6—SCH6-resistant subgenomic HCV RNA replicons were selected from two stably transduced G418-resistant cell lines harboring subgenomic and dicistronic replicon RNAs derived from two different genotype 1b strains of HCV (Table 1). The 2H8 1.3 cell line contains replicon RNA derived from the Con1 strain of HCV, whereas Ntat2aNeo/EG replicon cells contain RNA derived from the HCV-N strain (17Yi M. Bodola F. Lemon S.M. Virology. 2002; 304: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Both of these RNA replicons encode an E176G substitution near the C terminus of the NS3 protease domain that has been shown previously to promote the replication of HCV RNA in Huh7 hepatoma cells (29Krieger N. Lohmann V. Bartenschlager R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4614-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, this cell culture-adaptive mutation was independently selected during the establishment of both of these replicon cell lines. HCV RNA replication was inhibited in both the 2H8 1.3 and Ntat2aNeo/EG cell lines by addition of SCH6 to the culture medium, with IC90 values of 0.4 and 1.6 μm (Table 1), respectively. In contrast, measurements of cellular 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide activity and RT-PCR assays for cellular GAPDH mRNA indicated that the CC50 for SCH6 was >10 μm. Thus, SCH6 selectively inhibits HCV RNA replication and has low toxicity for Huh7 cells.TABLE 1Genotype 1b subgenomic HCV replicon cell lines and compoundsCell lineHCV strainSCH6 IC90SCH6 CC502H8 1.3Con10.4 ± 0.2 μm (n = 8)>10 μmNtat2ANeo/EGHCV-N1.4 ± 0.01, μm (n = 6)>20 μm Open table in a new tab In preliminary experiments, the 2H8 1.3 cells containing the Con1 replicon were cultured in the presence of 0.1-2.5 μm of SCH6 with continued G418 antibiotic selection in an effort to force the selection of variant replicons with resistance to the NS3/4A protease inhibitor. A majority of the cells was expected to die because of the loss of antibiotic resistance as a result of inhibition of RNA replication and the subsequent reduction in replicon copy number"
https://openalex.org/W2089055807,"The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) potently inhibits macrophage function through activation of the transcription factor STAT3. The expression of SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signaling-3) has been shown to be induced by IL-10 in a STAT3-dependent manner. However, the relevance of SOCS3 expression to the anti-inflammatory effect of IL-10 on macrophages has been controversial. Through kinetic analysis of the requirement for SOCS3 in IL-10 inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) transcription and translation, SOCS3 was found to be necessary for TNFα expression during the early phase, but not the late phase of IL-10 action. SOCS3 was essential for IL-10 inhibition of LPS-stimulated production of iNOS (inducible nitric-oxide synthase) protein and nitric oxide (NO). To determine the domains of SOCS3 protein important in mediating these effects, SOCS3–/– macrophages were reconstituted with SOCS3 mutated for the SH2, KIR, SOCS box domains, and tyrosines 204 (Tyr204) and 221 (Tyr221). The SH2 domain, SOCS box, and both Tyr204 and Tyr221 were required for IL-10 inhibition of TNFα mRNA and protein expression, but interestingly the KIR domain was necessary only for IL-10 inhibition of TNFα protein expression. In contrast, Tyr204 and Tyr221 were the only structural features of SOCS3 that were necessary in mediating IL-10 inhibition of iNOS protein expression and NO production. These data define SOCS3 as an important mediator of IL-10 inhibition of macrophage activation and that SOCS3 interferes with distinct LPS-stimulated signal transduction events through differing mechanisms.

Macrophages form the first line of defense against foreign pathogens by producing pro-inflammatory mediators that either directly attack the invading organism, or recruit and activate other cells of the innate and acquired immune systems (1Taylor P.R. Martinez-Pomares L. Stacey M. Lin H.H. Brown G.D. Gordon S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 23: 901-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Macrophage recognition of pathogens is mediated by pattern-recognition receptors, including the members of the Toll-like receptor family (TLR), 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IL, interleukin; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; NO, nitric oxide; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; SH2, Src homology domain 2; KIR, kinase inhibitory region; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; CSF-1, colony-stimulating factor-1; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; IFN, interferon; SOCS3, suppressors of cytokine signaling-3; WT, wild-type. which recognize microbial structures forming pathogen-associated molecular patterns (2Ulmer A.J. Heine H. Chem. Immunol. Allergy. 2005; 86: 99-119PubMed Google Scholar). A well characterized pathogen-associated molecular pattern is the cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria called lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Binding of LPS to the TLR4 complex on macrophages leads to rapid macrophage activation. Whereas this inflammatory response is usually helpful and protective to the host, if left unchecked, the excessive amount of inflammatory cytokines produced leads to tissue destruction and pathologies such as septic shock (3Oberholzer A. Oberholzer C. Moldawer L.L. Shock. 2001; 16: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key physiological negative regulator of macrophage activation (4Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L. O'Garra A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 683-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (5364) Google Scholar). Activated macrophages produce various inflammatory mediators including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and nitric oxide (NO), all of which are suppressed by IL-10 (5Bogdan C. Vodovotz Y. Nathan C. J.

Mice in which the IL-10 gene is deleted develop inflammatory bowel disease (7Kuhn R. Lohler J. Rennick D. Rajewsky K. Muller W.

Immunopathol. 1994; 71: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In humans, the presence of elevated endogenous IL-10 is a positive prognostic variable in autoimmune disease (13Goldman M. Marchant A. Schandene L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 796: 282-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and allogeneic transplant patients (14Bacchetta R. Bigler M. Touraine J.L. Parkman R.

IL-10 initiates its actions on target cells by binding to the heterodimeric IL-10 receptor that belongs to the class II cytokine receptor family (4Moore K.W. de Waal Malefyt R. Coffman R.L.

STAT3 has been shown to be essential for the IL-10 inhibition of macrophage inflammatory mediator production (15Williams L.M. Ricchetti G. Sarma U. Smallie T. Foxwell B.M.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A number of IL-10-regulated genes have been identified as being regulated by STAT3, including the NF-κB family member BCL3, which is important in inhibition of TNFα transcription (20Kuwata H. Watanabe Y. Miyoshi H. Yamamoto M. Kaisho T. Takeda K. Akira S. Blood. 2003; 102: 4123-4129Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the cell cycle inhibitors p19INK4d and p21WIF1, which are required for IL-10 inhibition of macrophage proliferation (19O'Farrell A.M. Parry D.A. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Lees E. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A member of a family of negative regulators of cytokine signaling SOCS3 (suppressors of cytokine signaling-3) is also induced by IL-10 in a STAT3-dependent manner (21Ding Y. Chen D. Tarcsafalvi A. Su R. Qin L. Bromberg J.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Lang R. Pauleau A.L. Parganas E. Takahashi Y. Mages J. Ihle J.N. Rutschman R. Murray P.J.

The SOCS family of proteins is transcriptionally regulated by a broad range of extracellular ligands and function in a classic feedback loop to negatively regulate signal transduction through multiple cytokine and growth factor receptors (24Gadina M.

The family is comprised of eight proteins that possess a 70-amino acid region of homology referred to as the SOCS box, as well as a SH2 domain. SOCS1 and SOCS3 additionally possess a 12-amino acid-extended SH2 domain designated the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) (27Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SOCS proteins have been described to interfere with cytokine and growth factor signal transduction through a number of mechanisms. SOCS1 and SOCS3 can bind to the catalytic site of Jak family kinases (28Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A. Kamizono S. Syoda T. Kinjyo I. Sasaki M. Johnston J.A. Yoshimura A.

SOCS proteins can also interact with receptor phosphotyrosines through their SH2 domains (29Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol.

SOCS proteins have also been reported to target signaling molecules for ubiquitin-mediated degradation through their SOCS box-mediated interaction with Elongins B and C (27Krebs D.L. Hilton D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2813-2819Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and this complex recruits the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, forming the E3 ubiquitin-ligase (33Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The proximity of this ubiquitin ligase to SOCS-recruited signaling molecules can result in the proteasomal degradation of the latter (34Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M.

The role of SOCS3 in mediating IL-10 inhibition of macrophage function has been controversial. SOCS3 expression has been speculated to participate in inhibition of macrophage activation, not only because of its documented negative regulatory role in other systems, but also because of the observation that survival of many intracellular macrophage pathogens is associated with their ability to up-regulate SOCS3 expression (39Imai K. Kurita-Ochiai T. Ochiai K. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 2003; 39: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 40de Veer M.J. Curtis J.M. Baldwin T.M. DiDonato J.A. Sexton A. McConville M.J.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of SOCS3 in a mouse macrophage line inhibited inflammatory cytokine production and induced IL-1RA in a manner reminiscent of the effect of IL-10 on these cells (42Berlato C. Cassatella M.A. Kinjyo I. Gatto L. Yoshimura A. Bazzoni F. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This study also described diminished IL-10 responsiveness in peritoneal macrophages isolated from SOCS3–/+ mice. In contrast, other investigators using antisense methodology (43Lee T.S. Chau L.Y. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) or macrophage cells isolated from SOCS3–/– animals (22Lang R. Pauleau A.L. Parganas E. Takahashi Y. Mages J. Ihle J.N.

We now show that this discrepancy may be in part because of the time point at which IL-10 function is analyzed. Our studies indicate that IL-10 switches from an early SOCS3-dependent to a later SOCS3-independent mechanism for inhibition of TNFα. Furthermore, we use structure/function analysis of the SOCS3 protein to demonstrate that inhibition of TNFα transcription and protein expression, as well as iNOS and nitric oxide production, involve distinct SOCS3-dependent mechanisms. Reagents—All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. TNFα ELISA kits were obtained from BD Biosciences. Antibodies to SOCS3 protein and phospho-SOCS3 protein (phosphotyrosine 204) were kindly supplied by Dr. Nicholas Cacalano (University of California, Los Angeles). IL-10 was kindly supplied by Dr. Kevin Moore (DNAX Research Institute). Cell Culture—The J774.1 murine macrophage cell line (American Type Tissue Culture Collection) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 9% (v/v) fetal calf serum on tissue culture grade plates. SOCS3+/– and SOCS3–/– macrophage cell lines were established by culturing embryonic fetal liver hematopoetic progenitor cells (45Marine J.C. McKay C. Wang D. Topham D.J. Parganas E. Nakajima H. Pendeville H. Yasukawa H. Sasaki A. Yoshimura A. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1999; 98: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) in colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) media (Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 5 ng/ml CSF-1) in the presence of retroviruses encoding the SV40 large T antigen. After 2 weeks, isolated colonies were expanded and analyzed for CD11b and CD86 expression. Clones were also tested for their ability to produce TNFα in response to LPS. A panel of clones was selected for both SOCS3+/– and SOCS3–/– cells that express comparable levels of CD11b and LPS-stimulated TNFα. All cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a standard tissue culture incubator. Retrovirus Transduction of SOCS3–/– Cells—Myc-tagged SOCS3 constructs in the viral vector pMX-IRES-EGFP were provided by Dr. Akihiko Yoshimura (29Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Shouda T. Kitamura T. Dikic I. Yoshimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29338-29347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Viruses were generated by transfecting these constructs individually into the Plat-E viral packaging cell line using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen)-mediated transfection as described previously (19O'Farrell A.M. Parry D.A. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Lees E. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Viral supernatants were made 5 ng/ml in CSF-1 and 8 μg/ml in protamine sulfate and layered onto a 10-cm dish containing 2 × 106 SOCS3–/– cells. The viral supernatant was removed after 24 h and the cells allowed to grow for several days prior to isolation of green fluorescent protein-positive cells by flow cytometry. After sorting, these green fluorescent protein-positive cells were maintained in CSF-1 media. Northern Blot Analysis—SOCS3+/– and SOCS3–/– cells following treatment with LPS (100 ng/ml) or LPS + IL-10 (10 ng/ml) were harvested in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Equivalent amounts of RNA (10–20 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gels blotted onto a nylon membrane (Pall, Mississauga, Ontario) and cross-linked by exposure to UV light. The membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP random prime-labeled cDNA probes for TNFα and GAPDH as described previously (19O'Farrell A.M. Parry D.A. Zindy F. Roussel M.F. Lees E. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4607-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Parental J774.1, SOCS3+/–, and SOCS3–/– macrophages (5 × 106 cells) were treated with mIL-10 (100 ng/ml), LPS (10 ng/ml), or IL-10 + LPS at the concentrations indicated and lysed in 200 μl of buffer (150 nm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 mm NaF, and 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Sciences). Cell lysates were collected and protein concentration was measured using the BCA method (46Walker J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 5-8PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of cell lysate containing 100 μg of protein were boiled in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were subsequently electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, then incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then incubated with fluorescently labeled (Alexa Fluor 680) secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) for protein detection using the Licor Odyssey system. The following antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution: anti-SOCS3 (47Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), phospho-specific antibodies to SOCS3 Tyr204/Tyr221, anti-NOS2 (Santa Cruz Biochemicals, Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-iNOS (Cell Signaling, Toronto, Ontario). Measurement of TNFα and NO Production—SOCS3+/– and SOCS3–/– macrophages were plated at 2 × 105 cells/well in 24-well plates in CSF-1 media and grown overnight. The media was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 9% fetal calf serum and cells were stimulated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or LPS + mIL-10 (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Supernatants were collected and analyzed for the presence of TNFα protein using a mouse TNFα ELISA kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The NO content of the supernatants were determined using the Greiss assay (48Ding A.H. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2407-2412PubMed Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed using one-way analysis of variance and p values ≤ 0.01 were considered significant. Induction of SOCS3 Message by IL-10 in a STAT3-dependent Manner—From a survey of SOCS family members, we found that IL-10 treatment of J774.1 macrophage cells induces SOCS3 mRNA expression. As shown in Fig. 1, SOCS3 mRNA is induced by IL-10 as early as 30 min and this expression is sustained for as long as 10 h post-stimulation (data not shown). To confirm the role of STAT3 in IL-10 regulation of SOCS3, we also examined the effect of ΔSTAT3, a dominant inhibitory STAT3 lacking the C-terminal transactivation domain as we described previously (18O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), on IL-10 induction of SOCS3. Expression of ΔSTAT3 inhibited the ability of IL-10 to induce SOCS3 mRNA. In contrast, an analogous mutant of STAT1, ΔSTAT1, did not inhibit IL-10 induction of SOCS3, indicating that in these cells SOCS3 mRNA expression is STAT3-dependent. STAT3 activation by IL-10 requires two cytoplasmic tyrosines conserved in both the mouse and human (Tyr427/Tyr477 for mouse; Tyr446/Tyr496 for human) IL-10R1 subunit. Using J774.1 cells expressing the wild-type (hIL-10R:Wt) or Tyr446/Tyr496 mutant hIL-10R1 (hIL-10R1: TyrFF), as we previously described (18O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of the wild-type or mutant hIL-10R to induce SOCS3 mRNA. Cells were stimulated with hIL-10 in the presence of a mIL-10R1 blocking antibody to block the endogenous IL-10R1 of the mouse (18O'Farrell A.M. Liu Y. Moore K.W. Mui A.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1006-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Although hIL-10R:WT was capable of transducing a signal leading to SOCS3 mRNA expression, the hIL-10R:TyrFF were impaired in their ability to induce SOCS3 mRNA (Fig. 1) in response to hIL-10. Induction of SOCS3 Protein by IL-10—We next confirmed that IL-10 induces SOCS3 protein expression. SOCS3 protein is known to be very unstable (47Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and we found it necessary to pre-treat cells for 30 min with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to prevent SOCS3 protein degradation during preparation of the cell lysate. In the presence of MG132, SOCS3 protein expression could be detected in cells treated with IL-10 alone beginning at 60 min and increasing for up to 3 h (Fig. 2). LPS treatment alone did not result in SOCS3 protein expression, but addition of LPS along with IL-10 did enhance the amount of SOCS3 present resulting in detectable SOCS3 by 30 min of stimulation. IL-10 Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of SOCS3 Protein on Residue Tyr204—Cacalano et al. (47Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) were the first to report that SOCS3 protein becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to certain cytokines and growth factors and that this phosphorylation is important for SOCS3 function (47Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Tyrosine residues 204 and 221 were shown in fibroblasts to be necessary for SOCS3 to interact with and inhibit RasGAP in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation (47Cacalano N.A. Sanden D. Johnston J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The Cacalano group has since generated specific antibodies recognizing phosphorylated Tyr204 but not the unphosphorylated residue (Fig. 3A). We used these antibodies to examine whether IL-10 stimulation results in phosphorylation of SOCS3 on Tyr204. To stabilize SOCS3 tyrosine phosphorylation, J774.1 cells were pretreated with 10 μm sodium orthovanadate and 5 μm MG132 for 30 min prior to stimulation for 2 h with 100 ng/ml of LPS + IL-10 (100 ng/ml) or IL-10 alone. As shown in Fig. 3B, IL-10 treatment resulted in phosphorylation of SOCS3 protein on Tyr204 at 2h. Resistance of SOCS3–/– Cells to IL-10 Inhibition Is Time-dependent—LPS stimulation of macrophages results in production and secretion of TNFα and IL-10 has been reported to inhibit this at multiple levels targeting both transcription (23Williams L. Bradley L. Smith A. Foxwell B. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 49Denys A. Udalova I.A. Smith C. Williams L.M. Ciesielski C.J. Campbell J. Andrews C. Kwaitkowski D. Foxwell B.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and post-transcriptional mechanisms (49Denys A. Udalova I.A. Smith C. Williams L.M. Ciesielski C.J. Campbell J. Andrews C. Kwaitkowski D. Foxwell B.M. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 4837-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 50Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Carballo E. Alexopoulou L. Blackshear P.J. Gaestel M. Davis R. Flavell R. Kollias G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3760-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To characterize the potential role of SOCS3 protein in IL-10 inhibition of TNFα mRNA and/or protein expression, we compared the ability of IL-10 to inhibit TNFα production from LPS-stimulated SOCS3–/– versus control SOCS3+/– macrophage cell lines. Cells were treated with LPS ± IL-10 and supernatants collected after 2 or 4 h of stimulation. As shown in Fig. 4, the SOCS3–/– and SOCS3+/– cells produce similar amounts of TNFα. IL-10 is equally able to inhibit TNFα production down to 10–20% of the LPS-stimulated level in both the SOCS3+/– versus SOCS–/– macrophages at the 4-h time point (Fig. 4B). However, at the 2-h time point, IL-10 inhibits TNFα expression to 40% of LPS alone levels in SOCS3+/– but not in SOCS3–/– macrophages (Fig. 4A). To confirm the delayed TNFα inhibition in these cells is truly because of the absence of SOCS3 protein, we reconstituted the SOCS3–/– cells with a wild-type SOCS3 cDNA via retroviral transduction. SOCS3–/– cells reconstituted with SOCS3 cDNA regained their responsiveness to IL-10 and were able to inhibit TNFα production at 2 h (Fig. 4A, SOCS3:WT). These results suggest that during the early phase of IL-10 inhibition of TNFα production, IL-10 requires SOCS3 to mediate its action. Requirement of Various SOCS3 Domains in Mediating IL-10 Inhibition of TNFα Protein Expression—SOCS3 has three conserved regions: the SOCS box, SH2, and KIR domains, as well as two tyrosine residues shown to be important for its function in other cytokine systems. To examine the involvement of each of these domains in mediating the inhibitory effect of IL-10 on TNFα protein expression, we retrovirally transduced SOCS3–/– macrophage cell clones with myc epitope-tagged wild-type or mutant SOCS3 cDNAs (described in Ref. 29Sasaki A.

Lysates were also prepared from the parental SOCS3+/– and SOCS3–/– ce"
https://openalex.org/W2169759472,"The protein pattern of healthy human eccrine sweat was investigated and 10 major proteins were detected from which apolipoprotein D, lipophilin B, and cathepsin D (CatD) were identified for the first time in human eccrine sweat. We focused our studies on the function of the aspartate protease CatD in sweat. In vitro digestion experiments using a specific fluorescent CatD substrate showed that CatD is enzymatically active in human sweat. To identify potential substrates of CatD in human eccrine sweat LL-37 and DCD-1L, two antimicrobial peptides present in sweat, were digested in vitro with purified CatD. LL-37 was not significantly digested by CatD, whereas DCD-1L was cleaved between Leu44 and Asp45 and between Leu29 and Glu30 almost completely. The DCD-1L-derived peptides generated in vitro by CatD were also found in vivo in human sweat as determined by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry. Furthermore, besides the CatD-processed peptides we identified additionally DCD-1L-derived peptides that are generated upon cleavage with a 1,10-phenanthroline-sensitive carboxypeptidase and an endoprotease. Taken together, proteolytic processing generates 12 DCD-1L-derived peptides. To elucidate the functional significance of postsecretory processing the antimicrobial activity of three CatD-processed DCD-1L peptides was tested. Whereas two of these peptides showed no activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, one DCD-1L-derived peptide showed an even higher activity against Escherichia coli than DCD-1L. Functional analysis indicated that proteolytic processing of DCD-1L by CatD in human sweat modulates the innate immune defense of human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2129471397,"Partial, selective activation of nuclear receptors is a central issue in molecular endocrinology but only partly understood. Using LXRs as an example, we show here that purely agonistic ligands can be clearly and quantitatively differentiated from partial agonists by the cofactor interactions they induce. Although a pure agonist induces a conformation that is incompatible with the binding of repressors, partial agonists such as GW3965 induce a state where the interaction not only with coactivators, but also corepressors is clearly enhanced over the unliganded state. The activities of the natural ligand 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and of a novel quinazolinone ligand, LN6500 can be further differentiated from GW3965 and T0901317 by their weaker induction of coactivator binding. Using biochemical and cell-based assays, we show that the natural ligand of LXR is a comparably weak partial agonist. As predicted, we find that a change in the coactivator to corepressor ratio in the cell will affect NCoR recruiting compounds more dramatically than NCoR-dissociating compounds. Our data show how competitive binding of coactivators and corepressors can explain the tissue-specific behavior of partial agonists and open up new routes to a rational design of partial agonists for LXRs.

Nuclear receptors are a family of transcriptional regulators whose activity can be modulated by their binding to small molecule compounds, such as hormones and metabolites. For many members of the family, this property has allowed their use as drug targets (1Gronemeyer H. Gustafsson J.A. Laudet V. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 950-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). In most cases, however, full activation or inhibition of the receptor is not desired. Instead, agonists are required that only partially activate the receptor. Partial agonists can display tissue-specific activation or repression of nuclear receptors, as has been shown for the estrogen receptor partial agonist raloxifen (2Delmas P.D. Bjarnason N.H.

However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms leading to partial versus full agonism. Another example for nuclear receptors, which, if they are to be used as drug targets, require partial agonists, are the liver X receptors α (LXRα, 2The abbreviations used are: LXRα, liver X receptor α; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; LBD, ligand-binding domain; 22R-HC, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol; NCoR, nuclear receptor corepressor.

This observation has raised hopes that the manipulation of LXR activity would be of therapeutic value in the treatment of lipid disorders and atherosclerosis. However, activation of LXRs by agonistic compounds induces the expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids in liver cells (16Yoshikawa T. Shimano H. Amemiya-Kudo M. Yahagi N.

Thus, to develop LXR ligands as drugs for the treatment of atherosclerosis, partial, selective activators of LXRs are needed that induce cholesterol efflux in macrophages but do not induce fatty acid synthesis in liver. Among the currently known ligands for LXRs, some compounds, such as the sulfonamide T0901317, appear to have a purely agonistic activity, whereas others, such as GW3965, have been reported to be more selective in their activation of LXR function (19Schultz J.R.

Based on structural data, it has been predicted that the cofactor interactions induced by T0901317 and a natural ligand would differ from each other (22Williams S. Bledsoe R.K. Collins J.L. Boggs S.

We present here a detailed study of the mechanisms of LXR activation by synthetic agonists, including a novel chemotype and a natural LXR ligand. We show that partial activation of LXRs can be brought about by inducing a receptor conformation that enhances the affinity for both activating and repressing cofactors at the same time. We show that the net effect of the activated receptor on transcription depends on the prevalence of coactivators and corepressors in the cell and propose a novel classification scheme for partial nuclear receptor agonists. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—To measure the ligand-dependent binding of cofactor fragments to LXRs, proteins and protein fragments were expressed in GATEWAY-compatible versions of pGBT9 and pGAD424 in the haploid yeasts CG1945 and Y187 (Clontech), respectively. The following protein fragments were used: DAX1, full-length protein; NCoA3, amino acids 391–748; NCoA3-part, amino acids 622–748; RAP250, amino acids 546-end; NCoR, amino acids 1906–2313; TRAP220, amino acids 433–803; NCoR, amino acids 2157–2181; FKHRL, amino acids 411-end; PGC1, amino acids 1–676; SRC1, amino acids 381-end; TIF2, amino acids 548–878. In addition, two fragments from NCoA3 and SMRT were used that had been isolated in yeast two-hybrid screens (23Albers M. Kranz H. Kober I. Kaiser C. Klink M. Suckow J. Kern R. Koegl M. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 205-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Combinations of the various constructs were generated in diploid cells by mating of the respective strains. Diploids were passaged twice in 96-well plates in liquid medium and diluted 1:20 into selective medium containing LXR-ligands before fluorescence was measured as described (23Albers M. Kranz H.

Cell Proteomics. 2005; 4: 205-213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) after 22 h for T0901317 and after 38 h for all other compounds. To remove background signals, e.g. from the fluorescence of LXR ligands, relative values were generated by subtracting the signals of strains expressing only the cofactors but an empty vector instead of the receptors from the signals of strains expressing both cofactors and receptors in the presence of compounds. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Assays—The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of LXRα (AAH41172, Gln201-Glu448) was expressed as fusion protein with GST in BL-21 cells using the vector pDEST15. The LXRβ LBD (BC033500, Glu156-Glu460) was expressed as a GST fusion from a recombinant baculovirus in SF9 cells. Cells were lysed by sonication, and the fusion proteins purified over glutathione-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Assays were done in a final volume of 25 μl in a 384-well plate in a buffer containing Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 400 mm KCl, 0.9 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 215 ng of Streptavidin-xlAPC Conjugate PJ25 S (Prozyme), 2 ng of europium-labeled anti-GST antibody AD0064 (PerkinElmer Life Science), roughly 20 ng of the purified receptor and varying concentrations of amino-terminally biotinylated cofactor peptides and low molecular weight ligands for LXR. The mix was equilibrated for 1 h at room temperature and measured in a Victor V (PerkinElmer Life Science) fluorometer using 340 nm as excitation and 615 and 665 nm as emission wavelengths. The origin and sequences of the peptides used are shown in Table 1. The coactivator peptides were chosen from relevant LXR-coactivators such that they represent a range of affinities for LXR. For corepressors, we selected the higher affinity peptide from the two published nuclear receptor-binding motifs found each on NCoR and SMRT.TABLE 1Origin of peptides used in this study Numbers of amino acid position refer to the indicated data base entry from RefSeq.ProteinIdentifier (RefSeq)Amino acidsSequenceNcoA3NP_006525672–695SNMHGSLLQEKHRILHKLLQNGNSPSMRTNP_0063032138–2156RVVTLAQHISEVITQDYTRNCoRNP_0063022253–2277SFADPASNLGLEDIIRKALMGSFDDDAXNP_000466132–156CCFCGEDHPRQGSILYSLLTSSKQTTRAP220NP_038662631–655PVSSMAGNTKNHPMLMNLLKDNPAQ Open table in a new tab RNA Isolation and Analysis of Gene Expression by Real Time Quantitative PCR—Cultures of the monocyte-macrophage cell line THP-1 and the hepatocytes HepG2 were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection, Rockville, MD and were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol (THP-1), and minimal essential medium (Eagle) with 2 mm l-glutamine and Earle’s balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (HepG2) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by the addition of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma P8139) for 36–72 h, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was included in the medium of all subsequent experiments to maintain differentiation. All treatments were done in triplicate, and experiments were repeated at least twice. THP-1 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 nm 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h. HepG2 cells were seeded in poly-l-Lysine-coated 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/well in Eagle’s minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and grown to 60% confluency. Before treatment with LXR compounds, growth medium was changed to medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal calf serum for 12 h. Treatment was done for 12 h (THP-1 cells) and 24 h (HepG2 cells), respectively, in medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-stripped fetal calf serum (and 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the case of THP-1 cells). LXR compounds were dissolved in Me2SO, with the final solvent concentration not exceeding 0.125%. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen Rneasy mini kit and treated with DNase (DNAfree kit, Ambion). RNA was reverse-transcribed with Oligo(dT) primer and real time reverse transcription PCR (TaqMan) was performed using the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System and reagents supplied by Applied Biosystems. mRNA steady state levels were normalized to H3 histone (H3F3A) expression levels. The sequences of forward primers, reverse primers and TaqMan probes were as follows: LXRα, CAGCTCAGCCCGGAACAAC, GGAGCGCCGGTTACACTGT, FAM-CGAGAAGCTCGTCGCTGCCCAG-TAMRA; FAS, CTGAGACGGAGGCCATATGCT, GCTGCCACACGCTCCTCTAG, FAM-CAGCAGTTCACGGACATGGAGCACAA-TAMRA; ABCG1, GACGTGCCCTTTCAGATCATGT, GACGGCTGCGACGTCATC, FAM-CCAGTGGCCTACTGCAGCATCGTGTACT-TAMRA; ABCA1, TCCTGTGGTGTTTCTGGATGAAC, CTTGACAACACTTAGGGCACAATTC, FAM-ACCACAGGCATGGATCCCAAAGCC-TAMRA; SCD, TGGCATTCCAGAATGATGTCTATG, CTGGGTGTTTGCGCACAAG, FAM-TGCTGATCCTCATAATTCCCGACGTGG-TAMRA. Transient Transfection Assays—All transient transfections were done in HEK293 cells (obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of Micro-organisms and Cell Cultures), Braunschweig, Germany) grown in minimum essential medium (Eagle) with 2 mm l-glutamine and Earle’s balanced salt solution supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection, 4 × 104 cells were plated per well in 96-well plates in growth medium supplemented with 10% charcoal/dextran-treated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, South Logan, Utah) and transiently transfected the following day at >90% confluency by polyethylene-imine-based transfection. Compound stocks were prepared in Me2SO, prediluted in medium, and added 4 h after the addition of the transfection mixture (final vehicle concentration not exceeding 0.05%). Cells were incubated for additional 16 h before firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured sequentially in the same cell extract using buffers according to Ref. 24Dyer B.W. Ferrer F.A. Klinedinst D.K. Rodriguez R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 282: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar. Transfection efficiency was controlled via the pRL-TK Renilla reniformis luciferase reporter (Promega). The ligand-binding domains of LXRα (Leu155-Glu447) and LXRβ (Glu156-Glu461) were expressed from a GATEWAY (Invitrogen)-compatible version of pCMV-BD (Stratagene) as fusions to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast protein GAL4. pFR-Luc (Stratagene) was used as a reporter plasmid. The NCoR expression plasmid pCMX-NCoR was kindly provided by Andreas Hörlein. Natural and Synthetic LXR Ligands Displaying Partial Agonism—We used HTR-FRET assays to screen for novel LXR-activating compounds in a collection of combinatorial compound libraries. Among the active structures identified was a group of quinazolinone compounds, such as LN6500 (Fig. 1), that activated LXRα and LXRβ activities in HTR-FRET assays (Fig. 2) with an EC50 of 2.5 and 1.4 μm, respectively. When compared with the well characterized LXR agonist T0901317, the efficacy of LN6500 in HTR-FRET assays is in the range of 35% for LXRα and 80% for LXRβ. These efficacies of LN6500 are comparable to or slightly higher than those of the natural agonist (22R-HC). Similar activities are observed when these compounds are used in cellular reporter assays that have a stably integrated LXR-dependent promoter driving the expression of the luciferase reporter (data not shown).FIGURE 2Activity of LXR-ligands in cell-free cofactor binding assays. The ligand-dependent binding of a peptide modeled on a receptor interacting motif from NCoA3 was measured by FRET (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Error bars are S.D. derived from triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) However, when the same compounds are assayed in a cellular reporter assay that uses the LBD of LXRα fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain, differences in the efficacies of the compounds become apparent. The natural agonist and the quinazolinone compound only reach efficacies in the range of 2–12% of T0901317. Also GW3965 clearly causes only a partial activation of the receptors, reaching 37 and 62% of the activity of T0901317 for LXRα and LXRβ, respectively (Fig. 3). Thus, it appears that in these assays the three compounds behave as partial agonists, although to different extents. This difference can be detected in several cellular and biochemical assays (see below) but appears to be, for unclear reasons, very pronounced in the mammalian one hybrid assays. Differential Recruitment of Cofactors Induced by LXR Agonists—Activation of nuclear receptors by small molecule ligands triggers the formation of a binding surface for cofactor proteins on the LBD, termed AF2. In the presence of agonistic ligands, most coactivators bind to the AF2 site of nuclear receptors via a canonical leucine-rich motif (25Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H.

Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, or in the presence of antagonistic ligands, many nuclear receptors, including LXRs, preferentially interact with corepressors via a different leucine-rich motif, which is found on the two nuclear receptor corepressors NCoR and SMRT (29Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 30Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K.

The switch in binding preference is brought about in part by a 90° turn of helix 12 of the LBD, which opens up a larger groove for the longer corepressor interaction motif (33Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Selective interaction of activated receptors with subsets of cofactors has been put forward as a possible explanation for selective activities of nuclear receptor ligands (34Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 35Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). To see whether differential cofactor recruitment correlates with partial agonism for LXR, we used an array of cofactor constructs and tested their ligand-induced interactions with LXRs. Initial experiments were done at single doses using a quantitative yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown). Of 100 different cofactor constructs tested, 29 were induced to bind to LXR by T0901317 (data not shown). GW3965 induced the binding of the same spectrum of cofactors. A subset of these cofactors was further analyzed for dose-dependent recruitment to the full-length receptors (not shown) and to the LXR LBD by T0901317, GW3965 and LN6500, as displayed in Fig. 4. In these experiments, several compound-specific effects can be observed: (i) T0901317 and GW3965 are comparable in their ability to induce the binding of coactivators to LXRs, the only difference being a less efficient recruitment of PGC1 to LXRα by GW3965; (ii) LN6500 induces the binding only of a subset of the cofactors recruited by T0901317 and GW3965; and (iii) surprisingly, both GW3965 and LN6500 lead to an increased binding of LXRs not only to coactivators, but also to the corepressor NCoR. In contrast T0901317, causes only a modest binding of corepressors to LXRα at intermediate concentrations, and represses NCoR binding at higher concentrations. The latter observation is surprising because, according to the structural information available, the conformations required for the binding of coactivators do not allow the binding of corepressors and vice versa (33Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Thus, compounds are expected to enhance either the binding of coactivators or of corepressors, but not enhance the binding of both at the same time. Partial Agonists Induce a Different Conformation than T0901317— To study the effects of the compounds on the receptor in greater detail, we turned to cell-free binding assays.

We therefore measured the binding of varying concentrations of cofactor peptides to the receptors at saturating amounts of ligands. As can be seen in Fig. 5A, the unliganded LXRα displays a significant affinity for corepressor peptides (EC50 for NCoR: 25 nm), whereas it hardly interacts with the coactivator peptides. Inclusion of T0901317 in this assay produced the expected increased affinity of the receptor for coactivator peptides and a repression of corepressors binding, reflecting the well known conformational changes around helix 12 of the LBD. In contrast, GW3965 displayed a drastically different behavior; although the affinity for coactivator peptides was increased as expected, the binding to corepressors also was strongly enhanced compared with the apo-receptor, confirming data from the yeast two-hybrid experiments. Similarly, LN6500 and 22R-HC induced the binding of corepressors, however, these two compounds induced coactivator binding more weakly than T0901317 and GW3965.FIGURE 5Dose-dependent binding of cofactor peptides to the LBDs of LXRs at constant amounts of ligands detected by FRET assays. A, LXRα; B, LXRβ. The type and concentration of the ligand used is indicated above each set of curves. Note that the maximum binding achieved with the corepressor peptides and LXRα is higher in the presence of the GW3965, LN6500, and 22R-HC than in the absence of ligand. Error bars are S.D. of triplicates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data, LXRβ displays a greater affinity for corepressors in the absence of compounds (Fig. 5B). When compared with LXRα, the compounds display a similar rank-order with respect to the degree of coactivator and corepressor binding they induce. However, corepressor affinity is not significantly enhanced over the unliganded receptor by any of the compounds. Judged by the induction of corepressor binding, GW3965 appears to be more agonistic to LXRβ than to LXRα, as reflected in the cellular assays shown in Fig. 4. The differential behavior of receptors in the presence of the four compounds can also be observed in assays in which the compound concentration is varied, as shown in Fig. 6. Whereas the full agonist T0901317 inhibits NCoR-peptide binding with increasing concentrations, the partial agonists allow or induce the binding to the corepressor. The different effects of GW3965 on LXRα and LXRβ are again clearly discernible; whereas for LXRα, the binding to NCoR is induced over that of the unliganded receptor, it is inhibited for LXRβ but to a lesser extent than for T0901317. We conclude that T0901317 induces a conformation that allows only very weak binding of corepressors and strong binding of coactivators, as expected for a pure agonist. In contrast, GW3965, LN6500, and the natural ligand 22R-HC behave as partial agonists, as they induce a state of the receptor, which is flexible to adapt an agonistic or antagonistic conformation. Interacting cofactor peptides help to stabilize either of the two conformations in an “induced fit”-like mechanism. These observations correlate well with the effects of the compounds in cellular assays and provide an explanation for the partial agonism displayed by GW3965, LN6500, and 22R-HC. We would like to stress that the cofactor peptides used here serve merely as biochemical tools and may not be representative of the behavior of the full-length cofactor proteins. Sensitivity of LXR Agonists to the Cellular Cofactor Environment— Given the above data, it may be expected that the relative prevalence and availability of coactivators and corepressors in a cell would determine the net effect of a ligand on LXR-dependent transcription. Compounds that induce conformations that allow an interaction with corepressors should be more sensitive to increased amounts of corepressors than compounds that allow only weak corepressor binding. This prediction was tested in transient transfection assays. As shown"
https://openalex.org/W2169249786,"The histidine-rich amphipathic peptide LAH4 has antibiotic and DNA delivery capabilities. The peptide has a strong affinity for anionic lipids found in the outer membrane of bacterial membranes. A role for anionic lipids in release of cationic plasmid-containing complexes has been proposed previously, and disruption of membrane asymmetry and presentation of phosphatidylserine (PS) in the membrane outer leaflet is a general feature observed in diseased mammalian cells. Therefore, to understand the peptide-lipid interactions in more detail, solid-state NMR experiments on model membranes have been performed. 31P MAS NMR on mixed phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PS and PC/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) membranes has been used to demonstrate a strong interaction between LAH4 and anionic lipids. By using deuterated lipids and wide-line 2H NMR when probing lipid chain order, it is demonstrated that LAH4 preferentially interacts with PS over PC and effectively disorders the anionic PS lipid fatty acyl chains. In addition, we demonstrate that the efficiency of gene transfer in vitro to different cell lines is closely related to the degree of disruption of PS acyl chains for four isomers of LAH4. This work suggests a mechanism of selective destabilization by LAH4 of anionic lipids in the membranes of cells during transfection with implications for nucleic acid delivery in vivo."

A gold bead (40–200 nm diameter) was attached to the γ subunit of Escherichia coli F1, and then its ATP hydrolysis-dependent rotation was studied. The rotation speeds were variable, showing stochastic fluctuation. The high-speed rates of 40- and 60-nm beads were essentially similar: 721 and 671 rps (revolutions/s), respectively. The average rate of 60-nm beads was 381 rps, which is ∼13-fold faster than that expected from the steady-state ATPase turnover number. These results indicate that the F1 sector rotates much faster than expected from the bulk of ATPase activity, and that ∼10% of the F1 molecules are active on the millisecond time scale. Furthermore, the real ATP turnover number (number of ATP molecules converted to ADP and phosphate/s), as a single molecule, is variable during a short period. The ϵ subunit inhibited rotation and ATPase, whereas ϵ fused through its carboxyl terminus to cytochrome b562 showed no effect. The ϵ subunit significantly increased the pausing time during rotation.

Thus, further studies are required to establish the rotation rates and their ϵ sensitivity using a probe that exhibits lower viscous drag. In this study, we have evaluated the turnover number of E. coli F1, and studied the ATP-dependent rotation of a series of gold beads attached to the γ subunit. We analyzed the rotation rates of single beads, and observed stochastic fluctuation of rotation rates, high-speed rotation being ∼700 rps, when 40- or 60-nm beads were attached. Analysis of the average rotation rates and the ATPase turnover number, under the same conditions, suggested that ∼10% of the F1 molecules are active on the millisecond time scale. The ϵ subunit increased pausing of mechanical rotation leading to the lower rotation rate. Materials and Preparations—E. coli F1 with six histidine residues and cysteine substitutions (γS193C, γK108C) introduced into the α subunit amino terminus and γ subunit, respectively, were constructed from pBUR17 (14.Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida Y. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The engineered F1 was purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation (15.Iko Y. Sambongi Y. Tanabe M. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Saito K. Ueda I. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47508-47511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and gel electrophoresis showed the presence of about 1 mol of ϵ, but no detectable δ subunit (data not shown). The ϵ subunit and the same subunit fused with cytochrome b562 at the carboxyl terminus were purified as described previously (29.Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gold beads (40, 60, 80, 100, or 200 nm diameter) were obtained from British BioCell International and coated with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (30.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Fluorescently labeled actin filaments were prepared as described previously (14.Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K.

Assay Procedures—ATPase activity was assayed as described previously (36.Futai M. Sternweis P.C. Heppel L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with a minor modification: the buffer for rotation was used to compare the results with the rotation rate. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 mm ATP, and terminated with trichloroacetic acid immediately after a 10-min incubation at 24 °C. Each mixture was centrifuged, and then the phosphate released was determined. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Fraction V) as a standard. The concentration of F1 (α3β3γϵ) was determined assuming its molecular weight = 365,000. Observation of Rotation—To observe rotation, a gold bead was connected to the γ subunit of F1 immobilized on a glass surface. A flow cell (∼30 μm deep) was constructed from cover glass washed extensively with 0.1 n KOH, filled with Buffer A (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2) containing 200 nm engineered F1, and then incubated at 24 °C for 10 min. After washing off unbound F1 with Buffer A, streptavidin (4 μm) in Buffer A was introduced into the cell, followed by incubation for 5 min and then extensive washing with 100 μl of Buffer A. Gold beads (0.2%) in the same buffer were introduced and washed similarly. Buffer A containing 2 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, and 50 μg/ml pyruvate kinase was introduced to start the rotation. To examine the effect of the ϵ subunit, 100 nm ϵ in Buffer A was introduced into the flow cell after the gold beads, followed by incubation for 10 min and then the introduction of Buffer A containing 100 nm ϵ subunit, ATP, and its regenerating system. To test the effects of LDAO, Buffer A containing 0.5% LDAO, ATP, and an ATP regenerating system was introduced. Images of gold beads illuminated with laser light (532 nm) were observed at 24 °C by dark field microscopy (BX51WI-CDEVA-F, Olympus, Tokyo) with a ×100 objective and ×2 relay lenses, and recorded with an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Photron Co.). Camera speeds used were 2,000–4,000 frames/s. The temperature of the assay mixture was determined by introducing a probe into the immersion oil (∼50 μm deep) between the objective lens and the flow cell. The laser light was generated using JUNO EX (Showa Optronics Co.), and power levels between 0.3 and 0.02 watts gave essentially the same results. The bead centroid was analyzed, and rotation results were obtained using MetaMorph (Molecular Device). Rotation of the fluorescent actin filaments connected to the γ subunit of F1 was observed using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 with a charge-coupled device camera as described previously (14.Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yanagida Y. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7780-7784Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The rotating filaments were subjected to video recording and centroid analysis. ATPase Activity of F1 Engineered for Rotation—The F1 engineered for rotation has an NH2-terminal His6 tag and Cys substitutions introduced into the α and γ subunits, respectively. The ATPase activity of the engineered F1 was assayed essentially under the same conditions as those used for rotation. The engineered and non-engineered wild-type F1 showed similar ATPase activity (Table 1). The differences from previous results (14.Omote H. Sambonmatsu N. Saito K. Sambongi Y. Iwamoto-Kihara A.

The present turnover number (91 s–1 at 24 °C) corresponds to the γ subunit rotation rate of 30 rps, estimated assuming that three ATP molecules were hydrolyzed during one rotation. It became of interest to compare the ATPase turnover number with the single molecule rotation using probes exhibiting lower viscous drag.TABLE 1ATPase activities of F1 engineered for rotationF1 preparationATPase activityTurnover numberRotation rates estimated from ATPaseϵ Inhibitionunits/mg proteins-1%1F1, non-engineered14.7 ± 0.39030 + ϵ7.3 ± 0.2451550 + ϵ-Cytochrome b56215.9 ± 0.19732∼02F1, engineered for rotation14.9 ± 0.19130 + ϵ6.9 ± 0.2421454 + ϵ-Cytochrome b56215.4 ± 0.09431∼0 Open table in a new tab ATP-dependent Rotation of Gold Beads Attached to the γ Subunit— ATP-dependent rotation of a gold bead (40–200 nm diameter) was examined under laser light illumination for less than 0.2 s (Fig. 1a). Beads rotating continuously could be detected by inspecting images on the monitor screen (Fig. 1b). We selected the laser light power allowing quick and clear observation, although essentially the same rates were obtained when the power was reduced to 1/10 or increased 1.5-fold. The frequency of beads rotating continuously for more than 20 revolutions was ∼1% when ∼1000 beads were examined on the monitor screen. The rotation rates of 100- and 200-nm beads were apparently slower than those of 40- and 60-nm beads (Fig. 1c). Because rotation speeds were apparently variable, the rates were estimated every 10 ms for each randomly selected bead. The resulting histograms indicate stochastic fluctuation of the rotation speeds showing a Gaussian distribution (Fig. 1d). The fluctuation of the rotation speed was clearly observed with smaller gold beads, but decreased with larger beads (compare 40- and 200-nm beads). These results indicate that the fluctuation is an intrinsic property of γ subunit rotation that may be masked when probes with large viscous drag are used to observe rotation. High-speed Rotation of Gold Beads—Stochastic fluctuation of the rotation speed prompted us to determine high-speed and average rotation rates. To estimate high-speed rates, we randomly selected beads showing more than 20 continuous rotations, and estimated the fastest rates (maximal rotation rates) (Fig. 2a). As expected, rotation became slower with an increase in the bead diameters (Fig. 2b). The high-speed rates for 200-, 100-, 80-, 60-, and 40-nm beads were 146, 389, 506, 671, and 721 rps, respectively, with standard deviations of 7–17% of these values. Gold beads rotated much faster than actin filaments connected to F1 (Fig. 2b). The 40- and 60-nm beads rotated at essentially the same speed, indicating that their rates were close to those that would be exhibited without viscous friction. It should be noted that the high-speed rate of the 40-nm beads was about 24-fold faster than that estimated from the ATPase turnover number (Table 1). Average Rotation Rates of Gold Beads—As described above, the rotation rates were variable during the observation, and the high-speed rates were much faster than those expected from the ATPase turnovers (Fig. 2b, Table 1). Thus, it was of interest to estimate the average rotation rates. Rotating 60-nm beads were selected randomly, and their rates were estimated every 10 ms (Fig. 2c). Paused beads (0 rps in 10 ms) were often found, and included for calculation, assuming that paused F1 molecules are present in the steady-state (bulk phase) ATPase assay. The overall average rate was 381 ± 33 rps, i.e. close to 13 times faster than expected from the turnover number obtained for steady-state ATPase. As seen with high-speed rates, 40- and 60-nm beads gave essentially the same average rates (Fig. 2b), confirming that their rates were close to those without viscous friction. Effect of the ϵ Subunit on Steady-state ATPase—The ϵ subunit is known to inhibit F1-ATPase activity, although its effect on rotation was not observed previously.2 The ATPase activities of wild-type and engineered F1 were inhibited about 50% with excess ϵ subunit when assayed with 2 nm F1 (Table 1), indicating that the genetic modifications introduced to observe the rotation had no effect on the ϵ inhibition. The ϵ with cytochrome b562 connected at the carboxyl terminus was not inhibitory, confirming previously published results (29.Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to study the effects of the ϵ subunit on gold bead rotation. Effect of the ϵ Subunit on F1 Rotation—For estimating the ϵ effect under conditions similar to ATPase assay, we estimated the concentration of F1 bound to the glass surface. The fraction of added F1 immobilized on the glass surface was ∼8%, as estimated by ATPase activity, when we introduced 200 nm F1. Thus, addition of 100 nm ϵ to the rotation assay provides an excess ϵ similar to that used in testing its effect on bulk ATPase activity. As described above for gold beads connected with F1, rotation in the presence of ϵ exhibited various rates. However, the time courses with ϵ were slower than those without ϵ (Fig. 3a). Histograms of the rotation speed in the presence of the ϵ subunit also showed stochastic fluctuation similar to the distribution curve without ϵ (Fig. 3b). It is noteworthy that the histogram of rates in the presence of ϵ showed two populations with one peak at less than 40 rps and another at 200–240 rps. Most of the former population are paused beads. The second peak is slower than that at ∼380 rps without the ϵ subunit, indicating that ϵ inhibited F1 rotation. These results indicate inhibition of rotation by the ϵ subunit. We also estimated high-speed and average rates of rotation from apparent rotation of beads with the ϵ subunit. As shown for the ATPase activity, the average rotation rate of 60-nm beads by the enzyme in the presence of 100 nm ϵ subunit was ∼50% of that observed without ϵ (Fig. 3c). No inhibition was observed when the ϵ subunit connected with cytochrome b562 was introduced, or when immobilized F1 containing ϵ was washed with Buffer A right before the rotation assay (Fig. 3, b and c). The slight shift of the peak in the ϵ-cytochrome b562 histograms may be because of the interaction of ϵ-cytochrome b562 with F1. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of ϵ was reversible and that most ϵ was released from F1 during the washing step. With excess ϵ, high-speed rotation was also about 40% of that observed for F1 without ϵ (Fig. 3c). Because one of the effects of LDAO is to eliminate inhibition of F1-ATPase activity by ϵ (40.Lötscher H.R. DeJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we compared the effects that LDAO had on rotation rates and ϵ inhibition. However, no rotating beads were observed when more than 6,000 beads were tested in the presence of 0.5% LDAO. Effect of the ϵ Subunit on Pausing—As described above, histograms of rotating beads clearly indicated that a substantial population of beads were paused in the presence of the ϵ subunit (Fig. 3b). They were apparently paused at one of the three positions of stepped rotation (30.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) (data not shown). One possibility was that the ϵ subunit increased pauses to slow the average rate. Thus, we estimated pausing time, assigning beads to a paused state when they moved anticlockwise less than 0.06 rounds (∼21°) and remained stationary for longer than 0.25 ms (Fig. 4a). The appropriate camera speeds were used to detect such pauses. During a 250-ms rotation period, beads were paused for 60 ± 6 and 44 ± 5% of the time in the presence and absence of ϵ, respectively. Rotating beads were also analyzed in each 10 ms and total 10-ms pausing times are shown as histograms (Fig. 4b). The pausing times in the absence of ϵ were 2–6 ms, the average being ∼4.4 ms within 10 ms. The pauses became significantly longer in the presence of ϵ, the average time being ∼6.0 ms, i.e. about 1.6 ms longer than in the case of F1 without ϵ addition (Fig. 4b). Increased pausing was also consistent with about 3-fold lower frequency of observed bead rotation when the ϵ subunit was added (data not shown). It should be noted that the method to estimate pausing time is different from that used to obtain rates for the histograms in Fig. 3b. As described above, rates were estimated for 10 ms from the linear segment of the time course. These results indicate that the ϵ subunit increases pausing times, explaining at least partially the ϵ inhibition of rotation. The binding change mechanism predicted continuous rotation of the γ subunit together with the c subunit ring during ATP synthesis or hydrolysis (2.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). This mechanism ensures continuous energy coupling between chemistry and proton transport. The rotation of actin filaments connected to the γ subunit and γϵc10 complex in F1 and F0F1, respectively, has been recorded under a microscope (13.Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K.

Because the rotation rates were lower than those estimated from the ATPase activity, it was of interest to determine the rotation rate without viscous drag. In contrast to results with actin filaments, gold beads (40 or 60 nm) connected to the γ subunit rotated much faster than expected from the ATPase turnover number. Rotation speeds were variable, giving a Gaussian distribution of the histograms. The fluctuation may be because of the stochastic property of γ subunit rotation, because it was more prominent with the smaller beads. Consistent with this notion, larger beads showed less fluctuations. The high-speed rate, estimated as described above, was 670 rps for the 60-nm bead during the 250-ms assay. As ATP is hydrolyzed by multiple F1 molecules through steady-state kinetics, the average rate for randomly selected beads should correspond to the rate expected from the ATPase turnover number. However, the average rotation rate (380 rps) was still faster than the rate (30 rps) estimated for the ATPase assuming that three ATP molecules were hydrolyzed during one rotation. It should be noted that the rotation and ATPase turnover could be compared, because they were assayed under essentially the same conditions in the present study. The rate of rotation obtained was more than 10-fold higher than that expected from the ATPase turnover number. Although the F1-ATPase activity increased with temperature, the rotation rate estimated from ATPase at 50 °C was ∼200 rps (data not shown), the highest rate observed but still significantly lower than the rotation rate at 24 °C. The higher ATPase activity could not be estimated because F1 was not stable above 52 °C. Yasuda et al. (30.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar) reported that the rotation rate estimated from ATPase turnover was 30–60% of the rotation rate of the 40-nm beads in thermophilic F1 (30.Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Ueno et al. (31.Ueno H. Suzuki T. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) observed more recently that the steady-state ATPase activity of thermophilic F0F1 was only ∼10% of the value expected from the rotation. Although they did not determine stochastic properties of rotation, their results and our observations are consistent, showing that the rotation rate of a single molecule is significantly faster than that estimated from ATPase turnover. These results suggest that ∼90% of the F1 molecules are inactive or in an inhibited state at any given point in time. Another possibility, that the preparation contained 90% denatured F1, is unlikely, because transitions between long pausing and fast rotation were often observed. Furthermore, steady-state hydrolysis rates that were consistent with the observed rotation rates have not been reported, even when the enzyme was assayed at 37 °C (31.Ueno H. Suzuki T. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Why did we observe a significantly low population of F1 molecules that were rotating at the ∼250-ms time scale? The mechanism underlying the inhibition is worth considering. One possibility is that much of the enzyme is inactive because of the binding of the inhibitory MgADP at the active site (41.Omote H. Le N.P. Park M.Y. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25656-25660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 42.Hyndman D.J. Milgrom Y.M. Bramhall E.A. Cross R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28871-28877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also possible that both active and inactive conformations of F1 may exist in a slow dynamic equilibrium. Single molecule FRET showed the rotation of F0F1 in proteoliposomes during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis (34.Diez M. Zimmermann B. Börsch M. König M. Schweinberger E. Steigmiller S. Reuter R. Felekyan S. Kudryavtsev V. Seidel C.A. Gräber P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35.Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Gräber P. Börsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The rotation rates were close to the values expected from the ATPase turnover. The difference between the present and the FRET results may be partly because of the experimental systems. The FRET results were obtained from F0F1 in liposomes with a transmembrane pH gradient and membrane potential, whereas the present results were from the F1 sector. It is also noted that apparent rotations for hydrolysis and synthesis direction were also observed without nucleotides in the FRET experiment (35.Zimmermann B. Diez M. Zarrabi N. Gräber P. Börsch M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2053-2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Further studies on the two systems are of interest for understanding the mechanism of rotational catalysis in F1 and F0F1. F1-ATPase activity was inhibited ∼50% in the presence of 100 nm ϵ subunit. In the previous study, excess ϵ inhibited the activity by 80–90% (27.Sternweis P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 28.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The lower inhibitory effect in our case could be because of endogenous ϵ (about 1 mol/F1), which was expected to have dissociated partially from F1, according to the dissociation constant (1–3 nm) (28.Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Weber J. Dunn S.D. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19124-19128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the concentration of F1 used (2 nm). Another possibility is the differences in assay conditions, including buffers (44.Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 159: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ϵ with cytochrome b562 connected, although noninhibitory, has been shown to displace the natural ϵ and activate the enzyme (29.Cipriano D.J. Bi Y. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16782-16790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The coincidence of rates observed with added ϵ with cytochrome b562 with those when no ϵ was added therefore supports the interpretation that the endogenous ϵ dissociates from the enzyme during dilution and washing. Although excess ϵ inhibited the F1-ATPase activity, we previously observed no effect of ϵ on the rotational rate or generation of frictional torque, with an actin filament as a probe.2 In this regard, the previous workers (16.Kato-Yamada Y. Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19375-19377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) observed that actin filaments attached to the γ subunit of α3β3γ and α3β3γϵ gave the same rotational torque, suggesting that the ϵ has no effect. It seems likely that an effect of ϵ was not observed, because the rotation was substantially inhibited by the high viscous drag because of the actin probe. As expected, when using gold beads with lighter viscous drag, the ϵ subunit shifted the histograms to the lower rotation speeds. Histograms indicate the stochastic fluctuation of the rotation, and gave two populations with peaks at less than 40 and 200–240 rps. Most of the beads in the former population were paused. Consistent with this finding, the frequency of observing bead rotation was lowered. Thus, it was difficult to estimate the degree of ϵ inhibition from the single molecule observations, although the average rotation rates in the presence of ϵ were about 50% of those without ϵ addition. The inhibition was supported by the notion that ϵ binds to the γ subunit domain opposite to the gold bead binding site (45.Rodgers A.J. Wilce M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1051-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The turnover number is defined as equivalent to the number of substrate molecules converted to products in a given unit of time by a single enzyme molecule. However, the present study indicated that this enzyme parameter, which is generally obtained from steady-state kinetics, does not necessarily correspond to the value for a single enzyme molecule. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the rotation indicated that the turnover number is variable over time for a single enzyme. We are grateful to Dr. I. Fujii-Taira for help in data analysis.

A distinguishing feature of the PARs is that they all contain a preligand sequence located within their extracellular N-terminal domains (1.Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). PAR1 is cleaved by thrombin and other proteases at the Arg41–Ser42 bond to create a fresh 42SFLLRN47 N terminus that acts as an intramolecular ligand (11.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). NMR studies indicate that, following cleavage by thrombin, the PAR1 ligand region undergoes a large conformational change and docks to ligand-binding site(s), one of which is located in the N-terminal extracellular domain (13.Seeley S. Covic L. Jacques S.L. Sudmeier J. Baleja J.D. Kuliopulos A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides (e.g. SFLLRN) corresponding to the freshly cleaved N terminus can displace the tethered ligand from the ligand binding site(s) and fully activate PAR1 in an intermolecular mode (13.Seeley S.

Following intra- or intermolecular liganding, the transmembrane domains of the PARs undergo a conformational change that is transmitted to the intracellular loops (i1–i3) and C-terminal i4 domain. It is these intracellular loops and domains that communicate with the plasma membrane-associated heterotrimeric G proteins. PAR1 can interact with three of the four classes of Gα subunits, Gq/16,G12/13, and Gi, making it one of the most promiscuous members of the GPCR family (14.Aktories K. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J.

Presently, there is limited information regarding the molecular determinants of PAR1-G protein interactions. In a previous study using chimeric Gα subunits, we found that the N-terminal αN helix of the Gα subunit interacts with both PAR1 and the Gβ subunit and actively participates in transferring the signal between the agonist-activated receptor and G protein (19.Swift S.M. Sheridan P. Covic L. Kuliopulos A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2627-2635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the receptor indicated that both the PAR1 i2 loop (20.Verrall S. Ishii M. Chen M. Wang L. Tram T. Coughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6896-6902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and C-terminal portion of the i3 loop are important for coupling to Gq and Gi (21.Covic L. Gresser A.L. Talavera J. Swift S. Kuliopulos A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, by far the largest component of the intracellular portion of PAR1 is the C-terminal i4 domain, which comprises >55% of the mass of i1–i4. The involvement of the PAR1 i4 domain in ligand-dependent phosphorylation and internalization has been well documented (22.Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J.

The new high resolution x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin revealed an unanticipated 8th helix (H8) in the i4 domain anchored by the 7th transmembrane helix (TM7) and dual palmitoylation sites at Cys322 and Cys323 (28.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved in rhodopsin, PAR1, and nearly all of the Class A GPCRs. TM7 is critical for receptor activation and contains the essential NPXXY motif (29.Barak L.S. Menard L.

TM7 is also the site of attachment of the retinylidene ligand in rhodopsin and forms extensive interactions with TM1, TM2, TM3, TM6, and the 8th helix. Upon receptor activation, the 8th helix moves significantly outward from the adjacent TM2 and i1 loop (31.Altenbach C. Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L.

Studies with rhodopsin and other GPCRs have shown that the 8th helix makes direct contact with the membrane-associated regions of the G protein α and γ subunits (33.Phillips W.J. Cerione R.A. J.

To determine the potential involvement of the PAR1 8th helix and i4 domain in coupling to G protein upon stimulation by the extracellular tethered ligand (thrombin-generated) versus the intermolecular peptide ligand (SFLLRN), we constructed a model of PAR1 using the refined 2.8 Å x-ray structure of rhodopsin. The structural model was tested by extensive mutagenesis analyses, including point mutations, insertions, and deletions. We discovered a new structural signaling motif involving a network of H-bonding and ionic interactions that connects the 8th helix to the peptide backbone of TM7 and to the highly basic i1 loop. Our data are consistent with a mechanism whereby the 8th helix moves in a coordinated motion with TM7 and the i1 loop during signal transference from PAR1 to Gq. Materials—Human α-thrombin (3433 NIH units/mg) was obtained from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). Restriction enzymes and polymerases were purchased from New England Biolabs. SFLLRN, P1pal-H8 (pal-ASSESQRYVYSIL) and P1pal-H8-Ala (pal-ASSAESQRYVYSIL) were synthesized with a C-terminal amide at the Tufts Medical School Peptide Core Facility and purified by reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Expression of PAR1 in COS7 Fibroblasts—PAR1 and mutated variants were transiently expressed from an EF1α promoter in plasmids pCDEF3 (12.Kuliopulos A.

Plasmid pHEF was made by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter of pCDNA3.1Hygro with the EF1α promoter from pCDEF3, a pCDNA3-derived plasmid. Mutations were introduced into PAR1 by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. PAR1 mutations and sequence fidelity were verified by the Tufts Medical School DNA sequencing core facility. COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with DEAE-dextran using 5 μg of CsCl-prepared plasmid/10-cm dish of 60% confluent COS7 cells. Phosphoinositide Production Assay—COS7 fibroblasts expressing PAR1 were split into 12-well plates at 250,000 cells/well. 3H-labeled myoinositol (2 mCi/ml; Amersham Biosciences) was added to the cells 24 h prior to the experiment. Phospholipase C-β (PLC-β)-dependent accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was measured in the presence of LiCl. Wells were rinsed twice with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, then twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm LiCl. The cells were stimulated with agonist (in triplicate) for 30 min and then extracted with cold methanol and chloroform. The extracts were loaded onto columns containing 1 ml of anion exchange resin AG1X8, formate form, 100–200 mesh size (Bio-Rad). After loading, the columns were washed twice with 10 ml of H2O and twice with 10 ml of 60 mm ammonium formate/5 mm Borax. Column fractions were eluted with 4 ml of 2 m ammonium formate/0.1 m formic acid into vials containing 7.5 ml of scintillation mixture and then counted. The mean of 3–5 determinations was expressed as the fold stimulation above vehicle-treated cells. Flow Cytometry—The rabbit polyclonal antibody (SFLLR-Ab) directed against the PAR1 ligand region was generated as previously described (12.Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PAR1-transfected COS7 cells (5 × 105) were probed with 2.5 μg/ml anti-SFLLR-Ab followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG (6 mg/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The cells were analyzed for fluorescence with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). COS7 cells transfected with empty vector were probed with both primary and secondary antibodies to determine background fluorescence. PAR1 Structural Model—Using the refined 2.8-Å x-ray structure of tetragonal P41 bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1HZX) as template (40.Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7762Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), we generated a structural model of human PAR1 that would serve to test the role of the C-terminal cytoplasmic i4 domain in receptor activation of G proteins. With the exception of the long N-terminal extracellular (e1) domain in PAR1, which harbors the tethered ligand and ligand-binding site 1 (13.Seeley S. Covic L. Jacques S.L. Sudmeier J. Baleja J.D. Kuliopulos A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), human PAR1 and bovine rhodopsin have very similar primary amino acid sequences (49% homology), with only a few minor insertions and deletions. Using the Turbo3.0 molecular modeling program, residues 66–412 of PAR1 were manually substituted for residues 1–348 of bovine rhodopsin. An insertion consisting of PAR1 residues 345TTEA348 was placed in extracellular loop e4 between rhodopsin residues Phe283 and Gly284. The PAR1 i3 loop lacks a pentapeptide region corresponding to rhodopsin residues 236QQQES240, which interestingly does not have electron density in the tetragonal P41 (28.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar) nor in the trigonal P31 rhodopsin x-ray structures (41.Li J. Edwards P.C. Burghammer M. Villa C. Schertler G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Stereochemically reasonable positions were used for side chains that were later subjected to molecular dynamics and energy minimization using the program CNS to yield the final structural model. The published sequence of human PAR1 (11.Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) differs slightly from the PAR1 clone (12.Kuliopulos A. Covic L. Seeley S.K. Sheridan P.J. Helin J. Costello C.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4572-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) that we used in all of these studies. As occurs in PAR1 from other species (baboon, mouse, hamster, Xenopus), our human PAR1 clone has a Leu238 instead of Val and a Cys364 instead of Ser, and our structural model incorporated Leu and Cys at these two positions, respectively. Overall, the peptide backbone of our PAR1 model was very similar to that of rhodopsin (root mean square deviation = 0.29 Å). In our model, however, the volume occupied by the retinal is filled by a series of bulky residues, which replace their less bulky counterparts in rhodopsin. These residues include Phe182, Tyr183,Met186,His255, Phe274, and Asn330, which replace rhodopsin residues Ala117, Thr118, Gly121, Gly188,Met207, and Ala269, respectively. Four key structural features are highlighted in Fig. 1, A and B, namely the TM7 helix (purple), the cytoplasmic 8th helix (red), the i1 intracellular loop (green), and the tethered ligand (yellow) on the extracellular side. The TM7 helix is critical for receptor activation and contains the essential NPXXY motif and is bent at hinge residues Ser363-Cys364. The 8th helix of the C-terminal i4 domain is anchored to TM7 by a short Ala374-Ser375 linker and to the plasma membrane at its C terminus by dual palmitoylation sites at Cys387 and Cys388. The 8th Helix of PAR1 Is Essential for Receptor Gq Coupling—Extensive deletion, substitution, and insertion mutations were made to determine the role of the i4 domain and its proximal 8th helix region in PAR1-dependent activation of G proteins by both intramolecular (thrombin-generated) and intermolecular peptide ligand SFLLRN. The effects of mutation of the intracellular residues of PAR1 on coupling to G protein were assessed using a well characterized PLC-β-dependent inositol phosphate (InsP) assay (13.Seeley S. Covic L. Jacques S.L. Sudmeier J. Baleja J.D. Kuliopulos A. Chem. Biol. 2003; 10: 1033-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PLC-β is directly activated by Gq α-subunits and/or by βγ-subunits from Gi to generate InsP. To determine the contribution of Gi(βγ) to the InsP signal we added the Gi inhibitor pertussis toxin to COS7 fibroblasts transiently expressing PAR1. Pertussis toxin had no effect on the InsP signal generated by thrombin-stimulated wild type (WT) PAR1 (supplemental Fig. 1) nor on the PAR1Δ396 mutant (data not shown). Therefore, the InsP signal in the COS7 fibroblasts is derived from PAR1 activation of Gq and not from Gi(βγ). Deletion of the entire C-terminal i4 domain (Δ377) resulted in a large loss of apparent affinity and coupling efficacy to Gq by PAR1, activated by either the peptide agonist SFLLRN or by thrombin (Fig. 1C) as reported earlier (21.Covic L. Gresser A.L. Talavera J. Swift S. Kuliopulos A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). By comparison, deletion of the residues to the C-terminal side of the Cys-palmitoylation sites (Δ396) gave a 4–10 right shift in EC50 for G protein coupling but little or no effect on efficacy (maximal InsP production), suggesting that additional binding determinants for Gq may be present in the last 29 residues of the C-tail of PAR1. Deletion of only the 8th helix region (ΔH8) caused major defects in Gq coupling (60% loss of maximal InsP) in response to thrombin (9-fold EC50 shift) and SFLLRN (60-fold EC50 shift), similar to deletion of the entire i4 domain (Fig. 1C). Effects of Mutation of the Cysteine Palmitoylation Sites and C-terminal Residues of the 8th Helix—The 8th helix of PAR1 terminates with two cysteines that are conserved sites of palmitoylation in rhodopsin and many other GPCRs (Fig. 2A). The Cys-palmitoylate lipids anchor the 8th helix to the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer and have been shown to be important for G protein coupling efficiency and selectivity for many GPCRs (42.Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We found that mutation of the Cys-palmitoylation sites (C387S,C388S) caused 4–9-fold shifts in the EC50 value for thrombin and SFLLRN but had no effect on maximal coupling efficacy (Table 1, Fig. 2). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was then used to determine the role of the nearby C-terminal residues of the 8th helix in signal transference to G protein. Triple alanine substitutions of residues in the C-terminal half of the 8th helix had minimal effects on the EC50 value of PAR1-Gq signaling upon activation by either thrombin or SFLLRN. The maximal InsP signal for the S384A,I385A,L386A mutant was unaffected; however, the Y381A,V382A,Y383A mutation actually enhanced the EC50 value (2.5-fold left shift) and efficacy (130%) upon stimulation with SFLLRN relative to WT (Table 1, Fig. 2). These effects were not detected upon activation with thrombin, consistent with structural differences in intra- versus intermolecular modes of activation, as previously observed with mutations of the extracellular surface of PAR1 (43.Blackhart B.D.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal Half of the 8th Helix Is Important for PAR1-Gq Coupling—In contrast to the C-terminal half of the 8th helix, residues in the N-terminal half were found to be important for PAR1-G protein coupling. The rhodopsin structural models (28.Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Trong I.L. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M.

Gasimov K.G. Moussaif M. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37574-37581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in the model of Fig. 3A, the hydroxamate moiety of Gln379 from the Gln379-Arg380 dyad forms an H-bond with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Tyr372 immediately adjacent to the NPXXYY372 motif in TM7. Elimination of this H-bond network and loss of the connection between the Gln-Arg dyad and the Tyr372 peptide carbonyl group might disrupt coordinated movements between TM7 and the 8th helix (31.Altenbach C. Cai K. Klein-Seetharaman J. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15483-15492Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 32.Altenbach C. Klein-Seetharaman J. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15493-15500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We found that mutation of the Gln379-Arg380 dyad causes a 7.5-fold shift in EC50 value for SFLLRN activation of Gq and a 20% loss in maximal coupling efficacy upon stimulation by thrombin or SFLLRN (Table 1, Fig. 3). Point mutation of Cys378 to alanine had no effect on signaling, whereas mutation of 8th helix N-terminating residues Ser376 and Glu377→Ala gave a 40% decrease in the maximal InsP signal and a 4-fold shift in the EC50 value for thrombin and SFLLRN (Fig. 3, Table 1). Together, these data indicate that residues in the N-terminal half of the 8th helix are critical for signal transference between PAR1 and G protein. Synergistic Effects between the 8th Helix, Intracellular Loop 1 (i1), and TM7 on Coupling to Gq—The model structure of PAR1 predicts a novel ionic interaction between the Glu377 carboxyl group and the ϵ-amino moiety of Lys135 from the i1 loop (Fig. 4A). To test the potential importance of this 8th helix i1 loop interaction, we mutated these residues to alanine. The E377A and K135A mutants exhibited similar reductions in G protein coupling for both thrombin and SFLLRN (Fig. 4, B and C). Combining the two mutations within the same receptor (K135A,E377A) resulted in partially additive losses in EC50 value and coupling efficacy (Table 1), suggesting that Lys135 and Glu377 are cooperatively interacting residues facilitating the same step in PAR1 coupling to Gq (44.Mildvan A.S. Weber D.J. Kuliopulos A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 294: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Notably, the K135A,E377A double mutant had a coupling efficacy of only 30–40% (Table 1), equivalent to the effect of deletion of the entire 8th helix (Fig. 1C, ΔH8). As mentioned above, the model predicts an interaction between TM7 (Tyr372) and the Gln379-Arg380 dyad on the 8th helix. Creating a PAR1 mutant that combines defects in 8th helix-TM7 and 8th helix-i"

The secB null mutation did not affect cell growth but caused significant differences at the proteome level. In the absence of SecB, dynamic protein aggregates containing predominantly secretory proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm. Unprocessed secretory proteins were detected in radiolabeled whole cell lysates. Furthermore, the assembly of a large fraction of the outer membrane proteome was slowed down, whereas its steady state composition was hardly affected. In response to aggregation and delayed sorting of secretory proteins, cytoplasmic chaperones DnaK, GroEL/ES, ClpB, IbpA/B, and HslU were up-regulated severalfold, most likely to stabilize secretory proteins during their delayed translocation and/or rescue aggregated secretory proteins. The SecB/A dependence of 12 secretory proteins affected by the secB null mutation (DegP, FhuA, FkpA, OmpT, OmpX, OppA, TolB, TolC, YbgF, YcgK, YgiW, and YncE) was confirmed by “classical” pulse-labeling experiments. Our study more than triples the number of known SecB-dependent secretory proteins and shows that the primary role of SecB is to facilitate the targeting of secretory proteins to the Sec-translocase.

Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 2Mori H. Ito K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 494-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The core of the Sec-translocase is comprised of integral membrane proteins SecY and SecE, which form a protein conducting channel (3Van den Berg B. Clemons Jr., W.M. Collinson I. Modis Y. Hartmann E. Harrison S.C. Rapoport T.A. Nature. 2004; 427: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). The peripheral subunit SecA drives polypeptide chains in an ATP-dependent manner into and through the Sec-translocase (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar).It is generally assumed that secretory proteins in E. coli are targeted to the Sec-translocase by the cytoplasmic protein SecB in a mostly post-translational fashion (4Hartl F.U. Lecker S. Schiebel E. Hendrick J.P. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 63: 269-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 5Wickner W. Driessen A.J. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev.

However, direct evidence for SecB dependence is only established for six secretory proteins (PhoE, LamB, MBP, OmpF, GBP, and OmpA), whereas four secretory proteins (PhoA, Lpp, RbsB, and β-lac) do not seem to require SecB (9Randall L.L.

Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1906-1907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecB also has the capacity to assist the chaperone DnaK in the folding of proteins, as shown in vitro with luciferase as a model substrate (12Knoblauch N.T. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This indicates that SecB has the potential to assist the folding of cytoplasmic proteins. The successful complementation of a DnaK/trigger factor (TF) 2The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; MS, mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Ibp, inclusion body associated protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; SRP, signal recognition particle. 2The abbreviations used are: TF, trigger factor; MS, mass spectrometry; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; Tricine, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Ibp, inclusion body associated protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; IPG, immobilized pH gradient; SRP, signal recognition particle. double mutant strain by overexpression of SecB, and cross-linking of SecB to nascent chains of both secretory and cytoplasmic proteins in SecB-enriched lysates support this notion (13Ullers R.S. Luirink J. Harms N. Schwager F. Georgopoulos C. Genevaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7583-7588Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).SecB does not bind to signal sequences and peptide library screens suggested a very loosely defined SecB binding “motif” (12Knoblauch N.T. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This motif, which is ∼9 residues long, is enriched in aromatic and basic residues, whereas acidic residues are disfavored. It theoretically occurs every 20–30 residues in both secretory and cytoplasmic proteins and is too unspecific to facilitate genome-wide prediction of SecB substrates (10Dekker C. de Kruijff B. Gros P. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Xu Z. Knafels J.D. Yoshino K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Knoblauch N.T. Rudiger S. Schonfeld H.J. Driessen A.J. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34219-34225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus experimentation is needed to identify novel SecB substrates.To characterize the role of SecB in more detail and identify additional SecB substrates, we analyzed a secB null mutant using comparative proteomics. This analysis included flow cytometry, pulse labeling combined with cell fractionation, one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry (MS), complemented by immunoblotting. The comparative proteomics approach allowed us to investigate protein mistargeting, aggregation, and translocation kinetics, and to determine changes in the proteome composition. Our analysis showed that, although the secB null mutation did not affect cell growth, there are significant differences at the proteome level. Most differences pointed to protein targeting defects, resulting in a protein folding/aggregation problem in the cytoplasm. Careful analysis of the (sub)proteome(s) of the secB null mutant strain combined with a classical pulse-labeling approach enabled us to more than triple the number of known SecB-dependent secretory proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture Conditions—We used E. coli strain EK413, which is a MC4100 derivative that is ara+ (a kind gift from Ken-ichi Nishiyama), harboring plasmid pE63 as wild-type. Plasmid pE63 harbors the gpsA gene, which encodes for sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, under control of an arabinose inducible promotor and has a pSC101 origin of replication and a β-lactamase resistance marker (14Shimizu H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using P1 transduction, we moved the secB null mutation secB8 (15Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from strain HS101/pE63 into EK413/pE63, yielding an EK413/pE63-derived secB null mutant strain. As expected, the secB null mutant is unable to form single colonies on LB plates in the absence of arabinose; i.e. when GspA is not expressed (14Shimizu H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we will refer to this EK413/pE63-derived secB null mutant strain and EK413/pE63 as the secB null mutant and the control strains, respectively.Cells were cultured in standard M9 medium supplemented with thiamine (10 mm), all amino acids but methionine and cysteine, glucose (0.2% w/v), arabinose (0.2% w/v), and ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Overnight cultures were diluted 1:50 in pre-warmed medium and cultured at 37 °C. Growth was monitored by measuring the A600 with a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer. Under these conditions, we did not observe differences in growth (as monitored by A600 measurements) between the secB null mutant and the control (results not shown). For all the experiments, cells were harvested at an A600 of 1.0 (i.e. in the early exponential phase).Flow Cytometry—Analysis of the secB null mutant and the control by means of flow cytometry was done using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) instrument. Cultures of the secB null mutant and the control were immediately diluted in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of ∼106 cells per ml, and analyzed with an average flow rate of 400 events/s. Forward and side scatters were measured and used for comparison of cell morphology of the secB null mutant and control (16Hewitt C.J. Nebe-Von-Caron G. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2004; 89: 197-223PubMed Google Scholar). Propidium iodide staining was performed to assess viability (16Hewitt C.J. Nebe-Von-Caron G. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2004; 89: 197-223PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—The protein accumulation of SecB, SecY, SecE, SecA, Ffh, PspA, TF, GroEL, DnaK, and IbpB (it should be noted that the IbpB antiserum cross-reacts with IbpA) in the secB null mutant strain and the control strain were determined by immunoblot analysis. Cells were cultured as described above. Cells (0.2 A600 units) or inner membranes (5 μg of protein) isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation (17Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3973-3986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Osborn M.J. Gander J.E. Parisi E. Carson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3962-3972Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were solubilized in Laemmli solubilization buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Blotting, immunodecoration, detection, and quantification of blots were done as described previously (19Froderberg L. Rohl T. van Wijk K.J. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Protein Translocation Assays in Vivo—Protein translocation assays were done with 1 ml of culture each. Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml, Ci = 37 GBq) for 45 s and subsequently precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples were washed with acetone, resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, and immunoprecipitated with antisera to OmpA and β-lactamase, followed by standard SDS-PAGE analysis (21Froderberg L. Houben E. Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Park S.K. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1015-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gels were scanned in a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimager and quantified using the Image Gauge software (version 3.4). Potential SecB-dependent secretory proteins were C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged and expressed by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction from the pEH1 vector as described previously (20Froderberg L. Houben E.N. Baars L. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31026-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and the protein translocation assay was performed as described above except that antiserum to the hemagglutinin tag was used for immunoprecipitations.Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates for Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were cultured as described above. Radiolabeled cells were cultured in the presence of [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml, Ci = 37 GBq) for 1 min followed by the addition of an excess of cold methionine (final concentration 1 mg/ml). Cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and were subsequently washed twice in ice-cold M9 minimal medium. For labeled cells, cold methionine was included in the wash steps. Cell pellets were snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C. To prepare samples for isoelectric focusing, cells were lysed essentially as described by VanBogelen and Neidhardt (22VanBogelen R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 112: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice and then quickly resuspended in 40 μl of solubilization solution (0.3% (w/v) SDS, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 28 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 22 mm Tris base and deionized water) per 1 A600 unit of cells. Lysis was achieved by incubation at 100 °C in a water bath for 2 min. The samples were then cooled on ice for 10 min before addition of 4 μl of DNase/RNase solution (1 mg/ml DNase I, 0.25 mg/ml RNase A, 476 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 24 mm Tris base, 50 mm MgCl2 and deionized water) per 1 A600 unit of cells. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and were then immediately used for isoelectric focusing as described below.Preparation of Radiolabeled Membranes—Cells corresponding to 200 A600 units were cultured as described above. At the time of harvesting, an aliquot of 2 A600 units of cells was labeled with [35S]methionine (60 μCi/ml, Ci = 37 GBq) for 1 min. An excess of cold methionine (final concentration 1 mg/ml) was added and cells were collected by centrifugation either directly after labeling or after a 10-min chase. The remaining unlabeled cells were washed and collected by centrifugation. Before breaking the cells, labeled and unlabeled cells from the same culture were pooled back together resulting in a mixture of labeled and unlabeled cells with a ratio of 1:100 that was then used for membrane isolations. Carbonate-washed total membranes (i.e. a mixture of inner and outer membranes) were isolated essentially as described by Molloy et al. (23Molloy M.P. Herbert B.R. Slade M.B. Rabilloud T. Nouwens A.S. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), with the exception that we used sonication rather than French pressing to break cells. Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—The analysis of stained two-dimensional electrophoresis gels of whole cell lysates was first done on gels with a low protein load (0.5 A600 units of cells) to avoid saturation and allow analysis of highly abundant proteins, and then on gels with a high protein load (1 A600 unit of cells) for the analysis of low abundant proteins. 1 A600 unit of cells was used for the analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled whole cell lysates. Whole cell lysates were solubilized in 9 m urea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 2% (v/v) immobilized pH gradient gel (IPG) buffer for pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences) and bromphenol blue. For analysis of the outer membrane proteome, 350 μg of protein was solubilized in 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 1% (w/v) ASB-14, 2 mm tributylphosphine, 5% glycerol, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer for pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences) and bromphenol blue (23Molloy M.P. Herbert B.R. Slade M.B. Rabilloud T. Nouwens A.S. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The clarified protein solution was used to re-swell Immobilin DryStrips, pH 4–7 (Amersham Biosciences), overnight at room temperature. Isoelectric focusing was subsequently performed at 20 °C in a Multiphor II apparatus (Amersham Biosciences); whole cell samples at 80 kVh and membrane samples at 60 kVh at a maximum 3,500 V. Proteins were separated in the second dimension on 10% duracrylamide (Genomic Solutions) gels (10% acrylamide monomer and 1% bisacrylamide) containing 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.45), 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. After focusing, proteins in the IPG strips were reduced and alkylated, as described before (24Peltier J.B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F. Adamska I. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 319-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The strips were loaded on top of the second dimension gel by submerging the strips in warm agarose solution (1% (w/v) low melting agarose, 0.2% SDS, 150 mm bis-Tris, 80 mm HCl and bromphenol blue). Electrophoresis was performed with Tricine-SDS buffer system (25Schagger H. Aquila H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) in a DALTON tank (Amersham Biosciences) at 30–60 mA/gel for ∼48 h, until the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. Gels used for comparative analysis were stained with high sensitivity silver stain (26Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris N.R. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) and gels containing radiolabeled proteins were dried on filter paper. Preparative gels used for identification of proteins by mass spectrometry were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or with mass spectrometry compatible silver stain.Several proteins were found in multiple spots at different pI values, but with the same molecular weight. This was also observed in the outer membrane maps of E. coli constructed by Molloy et al. (23Molloy M.P. Herbert B.R. Slade M.B. Rabilloud T. Nouwens A.S. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Most of these “trains of spots” are because of modifications induced during sample preparation (27Berven F.S. Karlsen O.A. Murrell J.C. Jensen H.B. Electrophoresis. 2003; 24: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), likely because of stepwise deamidation of residues Asn and Gln, resulting in loss of 1 dalton and net loss of one positive charge. 3V. Zabrouskov et al., unpublished results. Image Analysis and Statistics—Stained gels were scanned using a GS-800 densitometer from Bio-Rad. Radiolabeled gels were scanned in a Fuji FLA-3000 phosphorimager. Spots were detected, quantified, matched, and compared using the two-dimensional analysis software PDQuest (Bio-Rad). The analyses of silver-stained and radiolabeled outer membrane proteins were done on the same set of gels. In all cases, each analysis set consists of at least three gels in each replicate group (i.e. secB null mutant and the control). All gels in a set represented independent samples (i.e. samples from different bacterial colonies, cultures, and membrane preparations), which were subjected to two-dimensional electrophoresis and image analysis in parallel, i.e. en group. Spot quantities were normalized using the “total density in gel image” method to compensate for non-expression related variations in spot quantities between gels. The PDQuest software was set to detect differences that were found to be statistically significant using the Student's t test and a 99 (whole cell lysates) or 95% (outer membrane) level of confidence, including qualitative differences (“on-off responses”) present in all gels in a group. Saturated spots were excluded from the analysis.Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry and Bioinformatics—Stained protein spots or bands were excised, washed, digested with modified trypsin and peptides extracted manually or automatically (ProPic and Progest, Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI), and peptides were applied to the MALDI target plates as described previously (28Peltier J.B. Emanuelsson O. Kalume D.E. Ytterberg J. Friso G. Rudella A. Liberles D.A. Soderberg L. Roepstorff P. von Heijne G. van Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 211-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The mass spectra were obtained automatically by MALDI-TOF MS in reflectron mode (Voyager-DE-STR; PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), followed by automatic internal calibration using tryptic peptides from autodigestion. The latest version of the NBCI non-redundant data base (downloaded locally) were searched automatically with the resulting peptide mass lists, using the search engine ProFound (29Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), as part of Knexus (30Field H.I. Fenyo D. Beavis R.C. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 36-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Criteria for positive identification by MALDI-TOF MS peptide mass fingerprinting were at least four matching peptides with an error distribution within ±25 ppm and at least 15% sequence coverage. During the search, we only allowed one missed cleavage and partially oxidized methionines. In the more complex samples, the peptides were also analyzed by nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS in automated mode on a quadruple/orthogonal acceleration TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF; Micromass, Manchester, UK) (see Ref. 31Friso G. Giacomelli L. Ytterberg A.J. Peltier J.B. Rudella A. Sun Q. Wijk K.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 478-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar for details). The spectra were used to search the SwissProt 42.10 data base with the Mascot search engine. All significant MS/MS identifications by Mascot were manually verified for spectral quality and matching y and b ion series.Isolation of Protein Aggregates—Protein aggregates were isolated essentially as described (32Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Langen H. Goloubinoff P. Bukau B. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 397-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). 100 ml of culture with an A600 of 1.0 was used for each aggregate isolation. The protein content of total cells and aggregates was determined with the BCA assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Aggregates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 24-cm long 8–16% acrylamide gradient gels. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and identified by mass spectrometry as described before.For radiolabeling of aggregates, 100 A600 units of cells were labeled with [35S]methionine (2500 μCi/ml, Ci = 25 GBq) for 30 s and chased for 1, 3, and 15 min by addition of an excess of cold methionine (final concentration 1 mg/ml). Aggregates were isolated as described above, solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2% SDS, and subsequently processed using an OmpA antiserum as described under “Protein Translocation Assays” (see above).RESULTSCharacterization of the secB Null Mutant Strain—Using P1 transduction we moved the secB null mutation secB8 (15Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from strain HS101/pE63 (14Shimizu H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) into strain EK413/pE63 (a MC4100 derivative that is ara+; a kind gift from Ken-ichi Nishiyama), yielding an EK413/pE63-derived secB null mutant strain. Hereafter, we will refer to the secB null mutant strain and EK413/pE63 as the secB null mutant and control, respectively. The secB null mutant and control were cultured aerobically in M9 minimal medium. Under these conditions, we did not observe any differences in growth, as monitored by A600 measurements. In addition, propidium iodide staining (16Hewitt C.J. Nebe-Von-Caron G. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2004; 89: 197-223PubMed Google Scholar) did not point to differences in viability between the mutant and the control (results not shown). Early log-phase cells were used in all the experiments described in this study. The morphology of cells was analyzed by means of flow cytometry (16Hewitt C.J. Nebe-Von-Caron G. Adv. Biochem. Eng. Biotechnol. 2004; 89: 197-223PubMed Google Scholar, 33Davey H.M. Kell D.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 641-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we detected a small increase of both the forward scatter and side scatter of secB null mutant cells (Fig. 1A). This indicates that secB null mutant cells are slightly bigger than control cells and most likely contain extra internal structures (i.e. extra membranes and/or protein aggregates).To verify the phenotype of the secB null mutant strain, we monitored the targeting of the established SecB-dependent outer membrane protein OmpA (14Shimizu H. Nishiyama K. Tokuda H. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and SecB-independent periplasmic protein β-lactamase (34Laminet A.A. Kumamoto C.A. Pluckthun A. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 117-122Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using pulse-chase radiolabeling experiments in combination with immunoprecipitations. As expected, the translocation of OmpA was hampered in the secB null mutant, as evidenced by accumulation of precursor protein, whereas the translocation of β-lactamase was not affected (results not shown). The levels of SecA, -Y, and -E were determined by Western blotting for the secB null mutant and control, because SecB delivers proteins to the SecYE protein-conducting channel through interaction with SecA (1Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Protein levels of the SecAYE-translocase components did not change in the absence of SecB (Fig. 1B). Ffh is a core component of the SRP targeting pathway, which mainly targets inner membrane proteins to the Sec-translocase but may have some overlap with the SecB targeting pathway (20Froderberg L. Houben E.N. Baars L. Luirink J. De Gier J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31026-31032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Sijbrandi R. Urbanus M.L.

Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5706-5713Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is not known if the SRP targeting pathway can compensate for the absence of SecB. Immunoblot analysis of secB null mutant and control showed that Ffh levels were unchanged in the absence of SecB. It has been shown that expression of PspA is up-regulated when the electrochemical potential is affected (38Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the electrochemical potential plays an important role in protein translocation we analyzed the levels of the PspA protein by immunoblot analysis. In contrast to several other Sec mutants (38Darwin A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), there is no PspA response in the secB null mutant (Fig. 1B).Analysis of Whole Cell Lysates of the secB Null Mutant by Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—To identify potential SecB substrates and compensatory mechanisms and/or stress responses in the secB null mutant, we used a proteomics approach. Whole cell lysates of the mutant and the control were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis, using IPG strips with a pI range from 4 to 7. To allow for quantitative analysis of highly abundant proteins, gels were loaded with limited amounts of protein, such that staining of highly abundant proteins was not saturated. The comparative analysis was based on 4 gels per strain (an independent culture was used for each gel). Gels were stained with silver, scanned, and images were analyzed and compared using the PDQuest software (Bio-Rad). Significance was determined using Student's t test (for details se"
https://openalex.org/W2119714006,"Due to its small size and particular isolating barriers, the eye is an ideal target for local therapy. Recombinant protein ocular delivery requires invasive and painful repeated injections. Alternatively, a transfected tissue might be used as a local producer of transgene-encoded therapeutic protein. We have developed a nondamaging electrically mediated plasmid delivery technique (electrotransfer) targeted to the ciliary muscle, which is used as a reservoir tissue for the long-lasting expression and secretion of therapeutic proteins. High and long-lasting reporter gene expression was observed, which was restricted to the ciliary muscle. Chimeric TNF-alpha soluble receptor (hTNFR-Is) electrotransfer led to elevated protein secretion in aqueous humor and to drastic inhibition of clinical and histological inflammation scores in rats with endotoxin-induced uveitis. No hTNFR-Is was detected in the serum, demonstrating the local delivery of proteins using this method. Plasmid electrotransfer to the ciliary muscle, as performed in this study, did not induce any ocular pathology or structural damage. Local and sustained therapeutic protein production through ciliary muscle electrotransfer is a promising alternative to repeated intraocular protein administration for a large number of inflammatory, degenerative, or angiogenic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2167708918,"Gap junction channels are essential for intercellular electrical communication in the heart. The most important cardiac gap junction proteins are connexin43 (predominantly) (Cx43), connexin40 (Cx40), and in early developmental stages connexin45. Since catecholamines play an important role in cardiac (patho)physiology, we wanted to elucidate whether catecholamines may affect expression of Cx43 and Cx40. Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed for 24 h to increasing concentrations of noradrenaline (1-10000 nM) (physiological agonist at alpha and beta-adrenoceptors), resulting in significantly increased Cx43-expression, while Cx40 was unaffected. In further experiments cells were incubated with either phenylephrine (alpha-adrenergic agonist) or isoproterenol (beta-adrenergic agonist) (0.1-1000 nM) for 24 h. Both catecholamines lead to a concentration-dependent increase in Cx43 protein and mRNA expression (EC50: 10-20 nM). Inhibition experiments showed that the phenylephrine effect was transduced via PKC, while the isoproterenol effect was mediated by PKA. Dual whole-cell voltage clamp demonstrated that increased Cx43-expression was accompanied by significant increases in gap junction current. In additional in vivo experiments, adult rats were subjected to 24-h infusion of isoproterenol or phenylephrine showing again significant increase in Cx43 but not Cx40. Adrenergic stimulation of cardiomyocytes can enhance Cx43 expression thereby increasing cellular coupling, indicating a possible role for catecholamines in the regulation of cardiac gap junction expression in cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W1988759802,"MCF-7 cells lack caspase-3 but undergo mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis via caspase-7 activation. It is assumed that the Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptosome processes caspase-7 in an analogous manner to that described for caspase-3. However, this has not been validated experimentally, and we have now characterized the caspase-7 activating apoptosome complex in MCF-7 cell lysates activated with dATP/cytochrome c. Apaf-1 oligomerizes to produce ∼1.4-MDa and ∼700-kDa apoptosome complexes, and the latter complex directly cleaves/activates procaspase-7. This ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex, which is also formed in apoptotic MCF-7 cells, is assembled by rapid oligomerization of Apaf-1 and followed by a slower process of procaspase-9 recruitment and cleavage to form the p35/34 forms. However, procaspase-9 recruitment and processing are accelerated in lysates supplemented with caspase-3. In lysates containing very low levels of Smac and Omi/HtrA2, XIAP (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) binds tightly to caspase-9 in the apoptosome complex, and as a result caspase-7 processing is abrogated. In contrast, in MCF-7 lysates containing Smac and Omi/HtrA2, active caspase-7 is released from the apoptosome and forms a stable ∼200-kDa XIAP-caspase-7 complex, which apparently does not contain cIAP1 or cIAP2. Thus, in comparison to caspase-3-containing cells, XIAP appears to have a more significant antiapoptotic role in MCF-7 cells because it directly inhibits caspase-7 activation by the apoptosome and also forms a stable ∼200-kDa complex with active caspase-7.

The MCF-7 cell line was derived from a patient with metastatic breast cancer and is an often-used model system for studying estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (for review, see Ref. 1.Simstein R. Burow M. Parker A. Weldon C. Beckman B. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Because many of the problems associated with breast cancer treatment involve the development of chemo-resistance to apoptosis-inducing anti-cancer agents, there is extensive interest in using MCF-7 cells as a model for investigating the mechanisms of apoptosis in breast epithelial cells. Caspase activation is a key event in triggering the morphological and biochemical changes associated with cell death (2.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar, 3.Hengartner M. Science. 1998; 281: 1298-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2450) Google Scholar). There are two primary caspase activation pathways involving either stimulation of cell surface death receptors (the extrinsic pathway) or perturbation of mitochondria (the intrinsic pathway) (5.Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Many anti-cancer drugs induce apoptosis by activating the intrinsic cell death pathway, which involves the release of cytochrome c and the activation of the apoptosome-catalyzed caspase cascade (6.Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 7.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 8.Cain K. Drug Metab. Rev. 2003; 35: 337-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In apoptotic cells inactive procaspases are activated via this cascade mechanism in which an initiator caspase is activated and subsequently cleaves/activates an effector caspase, which then cleaves and activates the next caspase and so on. Caspase-3 is the most active effector caspase in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, where it is processed and activated by caspase-9 and caspase-8, respectively. However, MCF-7 cells do not possess caspase-3 due to a 47-base pair deletion in the caspase-3 gene (9.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar, 10.Kurokawa H. Nishio K. Fukumoto H. Tomonari A. Suzuki T. Saijo N. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 33-37PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells must be independent of caspase-3 activation, although several studies have shown that apoptotic cell death in MCF-7 cells is accompanied by caspase activation. For example, in staurosporine-treated MCF-7 cells, recognized caspase death substrates including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, Rb, PAK2, gelsolin, and DFF-45 are cleaved (11.Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis, caspase-8 is activated, which cleaves Bid to release tBid, which in turn induces cytochrome c release and caspase-9 and caspase-7 processing (12.MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Other studies have also shown that caspases 9, 6, 2, and 7 are cleaved/processed to their active forms (13.Tang D. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9303-9307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, in the absence of caspase-3, MCF-7 cells can still activate a caspase cascade irrespective of whether the apoptosis is initiated via the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway, which is activated by many chemicals, including anti-cancer drugs, involves formation of the Apaf-1 apoptosome, a large caspase-processing complex (for review, see Refs. 6.Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar and 7.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) that typically activates caspase-3. Apoptosome formation can be modeled in vitro in cell-free lysates by the addition of dATP or ATP and requires at least three apoptotic protease-activating factors (Apaf-1–3) (14.Zou H. Henzel W.J.

The CARD (caspase recruitment) domain of Apaf-1 binds to a similar domain on procaspase-9, whereas the central CED-4 domain (98–412) is involved in Apaf-1 oligomerization. In the presence of cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1 undergoes conformational changes, allowing it to oligomerize to form a very large apoptosome complex. Using gel filtration chromatography, we have isolated from both dATP-activated THP.1 and B chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell lysates two apoptosome complexes with apparent molecular masses of ∼700 kDa and ∼1.4 MDa (17.Cain K.

Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown in apoptotic cells that the ∼700-kDa complex predominates and is the most active complex in processing exogenous procaspase-3 (18.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G.

Cohen G.M. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). More recently, we have used a proteomic approach to characterize the composition of this ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex and have shown that it contains solely Apaf-1 and caspase-9 as its core functional proteins (20.Twiddy D.

Several studies have reported that caspase-7 is cleaved and activated in dATP stimulated lysates (17.Cain K. Brown D.G. Langlais C. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and immuno-depletion studies indicate that caspase-9 is required for the processing of both caspase-3 and -7 (21.Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). By implication, it has been assumed that the Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptosome complex directly processes procaspase-7 in an analogous manner to that described for procaspase-3. However, there is no direct evidence for this, and to address this, we have characterized the role of the apoptosome in caspase-7 activation in MCF-7 cells. Our studies show that the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex is also formed in dATP-activated MCF-7 cell lysates and apoptotic MCF-7 cells and directly cleaves and activates procaspase-7. However, although the kinetics of Apaf-1 oligomerization is normal, the recruitment and processing of caspase-9 in the holoenzyme complex is much slower than in caspase-3-containing cell lysates. We also show that caspase-7, after activation by the apoptosome complex, forms a XIAP-caspase-7 complex that is not disrupted even in the presence of Smac and Omi/HtrA2. These data suggest that the absence of caspase-3 enables XIAP to have an enhanced inhibitory effect on effector caspase activation and activity and, hence, a more significant anti-apoptotic role in MCF-7 cells. Cell Culture, Apoptosis Assays, and Preparation of Control and Caspase-activated Cell Lysates—MCF-7- and MCF-7-transfected cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm Glutamax™ as described previously (12.MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For apoptosis assays, cells were harvested by mild tryptic digestion, and the percentage of apoptotic cells with exposed phosphatidylserine was determined by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding (Bender Medsystems, Vienna, Austria) and fluorescence-activated cell sorter essentially as previously described (12.MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1239-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).

For assaying cytochrome c release, cells were resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.025% digitonin, the cell cytosol and membrane fractions were prepared by centrifugation, and the cytochrome c content of the various fractions was then determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (24.Sun X.M.

In some experiments, to minimize mitochondrial breakage and release of pro-apoptotic proteins, MCF-7 cell lysates (digitonin and homogenization (Dig/Hom)) were prepared in an isotonic buffer (MSH), containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mg/ml Pefabloc SCD, one protease inhibitor mixture tablet/10 ml (Roche Diagnostics), pH 7.4, using a modified digitonin/homogenization technique (20.Twiddy D.

Briefly, the method assays the DEVDase activity of the sample, which is a direct measure of how much procaspase-3/-7 has been processed and activated by the apoptosome. In addition, aliquots of the DEVD assay mixtures were diluted 1:1 with 2× SDS loading buffer and analyzed for caspase-3/-7 processing by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fractionation of Cell Lysates by Gel Filtration—Lysates were fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography on either Superose-6 or Sephacryl S300 columns using a fast protein liquid chromatography (HR 10/30 column) protein purification system (Amersham Biosciences). Columns were eluted at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm HEPES/NaOH, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, calibrated with protein standards as previously described (18.Cain K.

Column fractions (0.5–2 ml) were analyzed for DEVDase activity and caspase-3 or -7 processing activity as described above. Aliquots of the column fractions were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for Apaf-1, caspases 9, 7, and 3 and XIAP. For the Western blot analysis, column fractions 5–17 and 18–30 were run on separate gels, and immunoblotting procedures were carried out in parallel. To ensure uniformity in signal response, the two blots from each column run were exposed simultaneously to Kodak X-Omat film. Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated with Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) before immunoprecipitation experiments with the indicated antibodies. Affinity Purification of Caspase-7 Complexes—Immunopurification of caspase-7 complexes was carried out using either an anti-active caspase-7 (Cell Signaling, New England Biolabs UK Ltd., Hertfordshire, UK) or anti-XIAP (clone 48, BD Biosciences Pharmingen) antibody covalently bound, respectively, to protein A and G Dyna Beads® (20.Twiddy D.

Immunopurification of caspase complexes was carried out from MCF-7 cell lysates (∼30 mg/ml) that had first been precleared by incubating (1 h at 4 °C) with 400 μl of Sepharose protein A-coated beads/ml of lysate. The precleared lysates were then diluted to 15 mg/ml with assay buffer and dATP-activated for 2 h at 37 °C before fractionation by gel filtration. Appropriate fractions containing active caspase-7 complexes were pooled and concentrated before adding antibody-tagged beads and roller mixing at 4 °C for 4 h. Affinity purified proteins were eluted from the beads with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE.

Caspase Activation in dATP/Cytochrome c-treated MCF-7 Cell-free Lysates Does Not Require Caspase-3—In this study we wished to investigate apoptosome formation and function in MCF-7 cells. It was, therefore, important to characterize cytochrome c and dATP-dependent caspase activation in the cell lysates. This in vitro model has been used with a number of cell lines, and caspase-3-containing THP.1 cell lysates undergo a marked increase (∼30–50-fold) in DEVDase activity (largely due to caspase-3 processing) when activated with dATP/cytochrome c (17.Cain K.

However, dATP/cytochrome c treatment of MCF-7 lysates produced only a very small increase in DEVDase activity (Fig. 1A) even though SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis showed that caspase-9 was processed to its p35/p34 forms and caspase-7 was cleaved to its p19 active form (lane 3, Fig. 1A). In contrast, MCF-7 cell lysates, activated with dATP and then incubated with recombinant procaspase-3, exhibited a marked increase in DEVDase activity that was accompanied by procaspase-3 processing to its p19 and p17 forms (lane 6, Fig. 1A). Caspase-3 markedly influenced the processing of procaspase-9, which was initially cleaved to the p37 (caspase-3 dependent) and p35 forms when the cell lysate was activated by dATP alone (lane 5, Fig. 1A) and then fully processed primarily to the p37 and p35 forms in the presence of dATP/cytochrome c (lane 6, Fig. 1A). Also, caspase-3 accelerated the processing of procaspase-7 to its fully cleaved p19 active form (lane 6, Fig. 1A). Interestingly, in the presence of recombinant procaspase-3, the p32 form of caspase-7 was detected when the cell lysate was activated with dATP alone (lane 5, Fig. 1A). This agrees with previous studies showing that the p32 subunit is formed by caspase-3 cleavage of procaspase-7, which removes the prodomain at Asp-23 (26.Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The modest increase in DEVDase activity observed in the dATP/cytochrome c-treated MCF-7 lysates could possibly be explained by the fact that caspase-7 has a higher Km and a lower kcat value for the DEVD synthetic peptide substrate (26.Denault J.B. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34042-34050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27.MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The results also suggested that caspase activation in MCF-7 cell lysates was slower than in caspase-3-containing lysates. We investigated this by comparing dATP-dependent caspase activation in MCF-7 cells stably transfected with either pcDNA3 (vector) or pcDNA-casp-3. Although in MCF-7/vector cell lysates the p35 subunit was detected 5 min after dATP/cytochrome c activation, processing of the procaspase-9 was not complete until 120 min (lane 7, Fig. 1B). The p34 subunit was not detected until 60 min after dATP/cytochrome c activation, whereas in MCF-7/casp-3 cell lysates, procaspase-9 cleavage was accelerated and almost complete after 10 min (lane 12, Fig. 1B). Thus, the p35 subunit was detected at 5 min, reached a maximum at 30 min, and remained constant until 120 min before declining to barely detectable levels by 360 min. The p37 subunit was detected after the appearance of the p35 subunit at 10 min and was maximal after 30 min before disappearing by 60–120 min. The time course also showed that caspase-7 activation in MCF-7/vector cell lysates was subsequent to caspase-9 processing, as the p19 subunit of caspase-7 was not detected until 30 min after treating with dATP/cytochrome c (lane 5, Fig. 1B). By this time there was already significant processing of procaspase-9 to its p35 form. The p22 subunit of caspase-7 (see 15-min exposure, Fig. 1B) was also detected, indicating that removal of the prodomain to produce the fully processed p19 form does not require caspase-3. In contrast, in caspase-3-containing cell lysates, caspase-7 processing was faster and more extensive than in the MCF-7/vector cell lysates and was paralleled by rapid and extensive processing of caspase-3 to the p20, p19, and p17 forms. In MCF-7 Cell Lysates, Apaf-1 Oligomerizes to Form Two Apoptosome Complexes—We next established that Apaf-1 could form a fully functional apoptosome complex in MCF-7 cell lysates. Gel-filtration chromatography of control lysates showed that Apaf-1 eluted as an ∼130-kDa monomer (fraction 18–21, Fig. 2A). After dATP/cytochrome c activation, most of the Apaf-1 eluted either as ∼700-kDa (fraction 9–14, Fig. 2A) or ∼1.4-MDa (fraction 5–8, Fig. 2A) apoptosome complexes. In control cell lysates procaspase-9 (∼46-kDa) eluted in fractions 20–24 (Fig. 2A). After dATP activation, both the proform and processed (p35) form eluted in fractions 20–24 (Fig. 2A). However, processed caspase-9 was not associated with either the ∼700-kDa or ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complexes. This contrasts with dATP-activated THP.1 cell lysates, where processed caspase-9 was detected in both apoptosome complexes and also as the free form (18.Cain K. Bratton S.B. Langlais C. Walker G. Brown D.G. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6067-6070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Next, we immunoblotted the column fractions for caspase-7, and in MCF-7/WT control lysates procaspase-7 eluted predominantly in fractions 20–24 (Fig. 2A), corresponding to a molecular mass of ∼60–80 kDa. However, after dATP activation, the active p19 form of caspase-7 eluted in fractions 18–21, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼200–300 kDa (Fig. 2A). The ∼200–300-kDa caspase-7 complex we detected in MCF-7/WT cell lysates did not contain Apaf-1 or caspase-9 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether or not the elution pattern of caspase-7 was different from that of caspase-3, we also fractionated MCF-7/casp-3 lysates by Superose-6 gel filtration chromatography. In these lysates Apaf-1 and caspase-9 exhibited similar profiles of oligomerization and cleavage, respectively, as did the MCF-7/WT lysates (Fig. 2B). Procaspase-3 eluted in fractions 21–24 (Fig. 2B) and is slightly smaller than procaspase-7. However, in dATP/cytochrome c-treated lysates, the active p19/17 forms of caspase-3 eluted in fractions 22–26 and not in the caspase-7-containing fractions (Fig. 2B). This is consistent with the known quaternary structure of active caspase-3, which is a 58–60-kDa tetramer and indicated that active caspase-7 forms a larger ∼200-kDa complex with one or more proteins. The ∼700-kDa Apoptosome Complex Directly Processes Procaspase-7—We next investigated the ability of the ∼700-kDa and ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complexes to directly activate effector caspases. Column fractions were incubated with procaspase-3, which is cleaved/activated by the Apaf-1-caspase-9 apoptosome. Caspase activation was determined by measuring DEVDase activity, which was predominant in fractions 9–14 (Fig. 3A). These fractions corresponded to the ∼700-kDa apoptosome complex, as determined by their Apaf-1 content (Fig. 2A). Those fractions corresponding to the ∼1.4-MDa apoptosome complex did not activate procaspase-3, and column fractions taken from fractionated non-activated cell lysates also did not activate this procaspase (Fig. 3A). From this we concluded that the ∼700-kDa complex was the only active apoptosome complex. The fact that it processed and activated procaspase-3 indicated that it should also contain caspase-9. However, we were unable to detect caspase-9 in the column fractions (Fig. 2A), as possibly the concentration of apoptosome was"

The subgroup II includes thioredoxins containing an N-terminal extension, the role of which is still unclear. Although thioredoxin secretion has been observed in animal cells, there is no evidence suggesting that any thioredoxin h is secreted in plants. In this study, we report that a thioredoxin h, subgroup II, from Nicotiana alata (NaTrxh) is secreted into the extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract tissue. Fractionation studies showed that NaTrxh is extracted along with well characterized secretion proteins such as S-RNases and NaTTS (N. alata transmitting tissue-specific protein). Moreover, an NaTrxh-green fluorescent fusion protein transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was also secreted, showing that NaTrxh has the required information for its secretion. We performed reduction assays in vitro to identify potential extracellular targets of NaTrxh. We found that S-RNase is one of the several potential substrates of the NaTrxh in the extracellular matrix. In addition, we proved by affinity chromatography that NaTrxh specifically interacts with S-RNase. Our findings showed that NaTrxh is a new thioredoxin h in Nicotiana that is secreted as well as in animal systems. Because NaTrxh is localized in the extracellular matrix of the stylar transmitting tract and its specific interaction with S-RNase to reduce it in vitro, we suggest that this thioredoxin h may be involved either in general pollenpistil interaction processes or particularly in S-RNase-based self-incompatibility.

When the Trx active site WCGPC is reduced, it is able to reduce the disulfide bonds of target proteins. Trxs are widely distributed in nature from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. In photosynthetic organisms, Trxs have been shown to be highly polymorphic and to participate in several central cellular processes (1Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Eur. J.

Although Trxs h have traditionally been considered to be cytoplasmic proteins, recent analyses (13Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Jacquot J.-P. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2004; 42: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) revealed that they can be further differentiated into three subgroups. Subgroup II includes Trxs h with N-terminal extensions. The biochemical function of these extensions remains unclear, and the available algorithms do not predict any targeting signal. Gelhaye et al. (14Gelhaye E. Rouhier N. Gérard J. Jolivet Y. Gualberto J. Navrot N. Ohlsson P.I. Wingsle G. Hirasawa M. Knaff D.B. Wang H. Dizengremel P. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, RPP13-1, a Trx h present in the rice (Oryza sativa) phloem sap, mediates its own transport from cell to cell through plasmodesmata only if its N-terminal extension is present (15Ishiwatari Y.

Here, we report an analysis of a Trx h that belongs to the subgroup II, from Nicotiana alata, called NaTrxh. The N-terminal extension of NaTrxh was not recognizable as a secretion signal, and yet we demonstrated that NaTrxh accumulates in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the stylar transmitting tract (TT) in N. alata. Moreover, fusion of NaTrxh to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) directed secretion of this fusion protein in two heterologous systems. We used two separate biochemical approaches, monobromobimane (mBBr) labeling and 4-aminophenylarsine oxide (PAO) chromatography, to test potential substrates of NaTrxh. S-RNase was clearly among the proteins reduced by NaTrxh, raising the possibility that it is involved in pollination, particularly in self-incompatibility (SI).

The PCR product was cloned in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) into the pGEX 4T-2 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST:NaTrxh fusion protein was separated by batch affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). NaTrxh was released from GST by thrombin digestion (Amersham Biosciences).

N. alata Total Protein Extracts—Total protein extracts from mature styles including stigmas, anthers, ovaries, sepals, petals, and young leaves from N. alata were obtained using 0.05 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.05 m NaCl, 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol as extraction buffer. Sequential Style Protein Extractions—N. alata styles were treated as described previously (26Wu H.M. Wong E. Ogdahl J. Chueung A.Y. Plant J. 2000; 22: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Hand-bisected N. alata styles (styles + stigmas) were submerged sequentially in two different salt concentration buffers for 2.5 h at 4 °C: (a) low salt buffer (100 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm Na2S2O4); (b) high salt buffer (400 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm Na2S2O4). Finally, the styles were ground under liquid N2 and homogenized in 400 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm Na2S2O4, 1% Triton X-100. Protein Assay—Protein concentrations were determined as described previously (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Reductase Activity Assay—Recombinant NaTrxh (NaTrxhrec) and recombinant Escherichia coli thioredoxin (Sigma) were evaluated for their ability to reduce insulin disulfide bonds as described previously (28Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of the NADPH/NTR system to reduce NaTrxhrec was evaluated as follows: NaTrxhrec (2.5 μg) and E. coli Trx (2.5 μg) in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, were incubated at 37 °C with 2.0 μg of recombinant E. coli NTR and 0.125 μmol of NADPH in a final volume of 100 μl. After incubation, 0.2 μmol of mBBr in 10 μl of acetonitrile was added, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer free of reducing agents, separated in 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and visualized under UV light (Fluor-S, Fuji Corp Saddle Brook, NJ). NaTrxh-Affi-Gel Affinity Column and Purification of Anti-NaTrxh Antibody—NaTrxhrec (16 mg) was immobilized to Affi-Gel-10 (Bio-Rad), as recommended by the manufacturer. The anti-NaTrxhrec serum was precipitated with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. After desalting, this IgG fraction was passed over the NaTrxh-Affi-Gel affinity column. Specific antibodies against NaTrxhrec were eluted with 50 mm glycine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 2.6. The samples were neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris. BSA-Affi-Gel and Gly-Affi-Gel Columns—BSA (20 mg) in 0.1 m MOPS, pH 7.5, was immobilized to Affi-Gel-15 (Bio-Rad), as recommended by the manufacturer. Gly-Affi-Gel column was made by blocking Affi-Gel-15 with 1.0 m glycine, pH 8.0, as recommended by the manufacturer.

Protein Gel Blot Analysis and Immunostaining—Proteins were fractionated in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and immunostained with anti-S105-RNase (1:10,000 dilution), anti-NaTTS (1:10,000 dilution) (32Cruz-García F. Hancock C.N. Kim D. McClure B. Plant J. 2005; 42: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), or anti-NaTrxhrec (1:1,000 dilution). In Vitro Identification of NaTrxh Target Proteins—Reduction of the disulfide bonds of target proteins was determined using the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE system (33Yano H. Wong J.H. Lee Y.M. Cho M.J. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) using the low salt buffer extract without Na2S2O4. Before the first dimension, proteins are labeled with mBBr after non-reducing (control) or reducing (with dithiothreitol (DTT) or NaTrxhrec plus NADPH and NTR) conditions. The second dimension gel was observed under UV light (Fluor-S, Fuji Corp., Saddle Brook, NJ). Low salt protein extracts from N. alata S105S105 in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, were passed over PAO resin (Invitrogen) after reduction by NaTrxhrec, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, or without reduction. After washing, the unbound fraction was collected. Bound proteins were eluted by sequentially washing the resin twice with 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol containing buffer, five times with 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and three times with 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol buffer. All the fractions were concentrated by lyophilization and were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose and immunostained with anti-S105-RNase antibody. In Vitro Protein-Protein Interactions by Affinity Chromatography— Protein extracts (1 mg) from N. alata S105S105 styles were obtained with binding buffer (BB, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.9) and passed over the NaTrxh-Affi-Gel affinity column. After recovering the unbound fraction, 10 bed volume washes were done with BB, and then the column was sequentially washed as follows: (a) BB plus 1% Tween 20, (b) BB plus 0.1 m NaCl, and (c) BB plus 0.2 m NaCl. Stronger interacting proteins were eluted with elution buffer (50 mm glycine, 50 mm NaCl, pH 2.6). The samples were neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris. Fractions were concentrated by cold acetone precipitation and were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose and immunostained with anti-S105-RNase antibody. Microscopy and Immunolabeling—N. alata SC10SC10 styles were harvested and fixed in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in an ethanol series, and embedded in Paraplast Plus (Poly-sciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Sections of 6-7 μm were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline plus 3% BSA, 0.01% sodium azide, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 4 h at 4°C. Sections were simultaneously incubated with the primary rabbit anti-NaTrxhrec antibody (1:50 dilution) and the primary mouse anti-SC10-RNase antibody (1:1,000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were then incubated with both secondary goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568-fluorochrome (magenta signal) conjugated and goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-fluorochrome (green signal) conjugated antibodies for 4 h at 4°C. Sections were observed using confocal fluorescence microscopy. Isolation of the Trx h cDNA—We isolated a cDNA (AFLP25F), which is differentially expressed between N. alata cv Breakthrough, an SC mutant plant that does not express the S-RNase, and SC N. plumbaginifolia. The full-length cDNA sequence of this transcript (Fig. 1A) showed extensive sequence similarity with Trx genes from plants. The predicted open reading frame contains the sequence WCGPC, described as the conserved Trx active site (3Holmgren A. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). To identify the type of Trx encoded by the AFLP25F cDNA (i.e. m, f, x, or h), we performed a phylogenetic analysis using the deduced AFLP25F amino acid sequence and other plant Trxs. The phylogenetic tree in Fig. 1B displays five major groups. Four of those groups correspond to organellar thioredoxins (f, m, x, and o types). The AFLP25F protein sequence clearly clusters with Trxs h, subgroup II. The AFLP25F product was named NaTrxh. To evaluate the disulfide reductase activity of NaTrxh, we expressed this gene in E. coli as a GST fusion protein. Fig. 2A shows the recombinant NaTrxh (NaTrxhrec) purified after cleavage from GST. Its ability to reduce insulin disulfide bonds using DTT as an electron donor (28Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2B. The results show that NaTrxhrec was able to reduce insulin disulfide bridges with a similar qualitative activity profile as the recombinant E. coli Trx (34Hoog J.O. von Bahr-Lindstrom H. Josephson S. Wallace B.J. Kushner S.R. Jornvall H. Holmgren A. Biosci. Rep. 1984; 4: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when NaTrxhrec was incubated with NADPH and recombinant E. coli NTR, the thiol groups of the reduced NaTrxhrec were labeled with mBBr. Fig. 2C shows NaTrxhrec and recombinant E. coli Trx sulfhydryl labeling in a time-dependent manner only when NADPH and NTR were present. Thus, similar to other Trxs h, oxidized NaTrxhrec can be regenerated by the addition of NADPH and NTR (12Florencio F.J. Yee B.C. Johnoson T.C. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 35Baumann U. Juttner J. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1042-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). NaTrxh Expression Pattern in N. alata—To analyze the expression pattern of NaTrxh in plants, we prepared specific affinity-purified anti-NaTrxh antibodies. Fig. 3A (right panel) shows that this antibody detects specifically NaTrxhrec with no cross reaction to E. coli Trx. This antibody was used to analyze the presence of the NaTrxh in different tissues of N. alata. NaTrxh protein is detected in all the tissues analyzed (Fig. 3B, right panel). This protein is particularly abundant in floral tissues including petals, ovaries, and styles, and it is present in lower levels in anthers, sepals, and leaves. Biochemical fractionation studies suggest an extracellular location for NaTrxh. SI N. alata S105S105 styles were hand-bisected, and the secreted proteins that accumulate in this tissue were differentially extracted using sequential washes with low salt and high salt buffers, as described (26Wu H.M. Wong E. Ogdahl J. Chueung A.Y. Plant J. 2000; 22: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Using this procedure, soluble ECM proteins are eluted by a low salt buffer, whereas more tightly bound proteins are released only after the high salt buffer wash. The extraction profile obtained for the NaTrxh protein was similar to S105-RNase and to the transmitting tissue-specific protein of N. alata (NaTTS) (Fig. 4). It is known that these two proteins are secreted and that they accumulate in the stylar TT ECM. NaTrxh is eluted with the higher molecular mass (i.e. 55-110-kDa) NaTTS isoforms (Fig. 4C, LS lane) that are thought to be present in the ECM (26Wu H.M. Wong E. Ogdahl J. Chueung A.Y. Plant J. 2000; 22: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting that NaTrxh is also secreted into the ECM of the stylar TT. NaTrxh Is Secreted into the Extracellular Matrix of the Transmitting Tissue—To further investigate NaTrxh localization and its secretion to the stylar TT ECM, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis using three-dimensional confocal microscopy. Cross sections of SI N. alata SC10SC10 styles were simultaneously immunolabeled with a mouse anti-SC10-RNase antibody (32Cruz-García F. Hancock C.N. Kim D. McClure B. Plant J. 2005; 42: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and with the affinity-purified polyclonal anti-NaTrxh antibody. Fig. 5, A2, A4 and A6, show that both NaTrxh and SC10-RNase colocalized outside of the TT cells, indicated by the yellow signal generated from the mixture of both green (SC10-RNase) and magenta (NaTrxh) fluorochrome signals. To show that the anti-NaTrxh antibody is specifically reacting with NaTrxh in the TT cells, we pretreated the antibody prior to apply to the tissue with NaTrxhrec. As shown in Fig. 5, A3 and A5, after pretreatment, only the green signal of SC10-RNase was detected. The experiments shown in Figs. 4 and 5A demonstrate that NaTrxh is secreted into the ECM. However, NaTrxh does not possess a canonical secretory signal peptide, and different secretion signal algorithms give conflicting results. For example, the Bendtsen neural network algorithm (36Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (5643) Google Scholar) does not predict any signal peptide, whereas the hidden Markov model algorithm predicts a signal peptide with a probability of 0.953 with a maximal cleavage site probability of 0.593 between amino acid residues 16 and 17 (Fig. 1A). Likewise, the Secretome 1.0 predictor (37Bendtsen J.D. Jensen L.J. Blom N. von Heijne G. Brunak S. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) predicts that NaTrxh (NN-score 0.874) is a non-classical secreted protein. NaTrxh Sequence Contains the Information for Its Secretion—To further corroborate that NaTrxh is indeed secreted in plants, an NaTrxh-GFP fusion protein expressed from the CaMV35S promoter (20Sheen J. Hwang S. Niwa Y. Kobayashi H. Galbraith D.W. Plant J. 1995; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) was constructed. This construct was used to analyze GFP expression pattern in transient assays in N. benthamiana and A. thaliana leaves (Fig. 5B). When the NaTrxh-GFP fusion protein is expressed, most of the GFP protein accumulates in the cell wall in either N. benthamiana (Fig. 5, B2 and B4) or A. thaliana (Fig. 5, B10 and B12). As expected, the GFP protein without fusion, used as control, was mainly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, B6 and B8). Thus, NaTrxh is sufficient to cause secretion of GFP, supporting the idea that this protein is targeted outside of the cell in N. alata. S-RNase Is Reduced by NaTrxh in Vitro—To investigate possible substrates for NaTrxh, we performed in vitro reduction reactions with stylar proteins and NaTrxhrec plus NADPH and NTR. Reduced sulfhydryls were labeled with the fluorescent probe mBBr and visualized after separation in a two-dimensional SDS-PAGE system in which non-reducing conditions were used for the first dimension and reducing ones were used for the second dimension (33Yano H. Wong J.H. Lee Y.M. Cho M.J. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4794-4799Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For these experiments, we used the low salt extractable ECM stylar protein fraction from SI N. alata S105S105 prepared without a reducing agent in the extraction buffer. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, there is a small amount of mBBr labeling where S105-RNase is the most prominent labeled protein observed (Fig. 6, B and G). Proteins reduced after the first dimension show altered mobility and shift off the diagonal in the second dimension. If reduction is incomplete, two spots are visible, as seen for S105-RNase (Fig. 6, A and B). Proteins fully reduced with DTT prior to mBBr labeling show brighter fluorescence and appear as a single spot after two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6, C and D). As expected, many proteins are reduced by DTT, and mBBr labeling is visible along the entire diagonal. Treatment with purified NaTrxhrec, NADPH, and NTR caused a specific increase in mBBr labeling of S105-RNase similar to the one obtained by DTT (Fig. 6, E and F). S105-RNase changed its mobility after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol for the second dimension (i.e. it appears as two spots in the second dimension), suggesting that NaTrxh only partially reduced S105-RNase before the first dimension. The specificity of NaTrxh reduction is apparent from comparison of the large number of proteins that shift mobility and appear off the diagonal after treatment with NaTrxh but not with the nonspecific reduction by DTT (compare Fig. 6, C and E). PAO affinity chromatography provided further evidence that S105-RNase is a substrate for NaTrxh. PAO matrices specifically bind proteins with vicinal thiols that can reversibly form a covalent bond with the resin (38Kalef E. Walfish P.G. Gitler C. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Low salt extracts from SI N. alata S105S105 either were applied directly to the PAO matrix or were first treated with 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol or NaTrxhrec plus NADPH and E. coli NTR. Fig. 7 shows that little or no S105-RNase bound to the PAO matrix unless it was first subjected to reducing conditions. Some S105-RNase was weakly bound under all conditions and eluted with 1 mm or 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 7A). Large amounts of S105-RNase, however, bound tightly to this column after reduction by 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 7B) or NaTrxhrec (Fig. 7C). The tightly bound S105-RNase eluted with 500 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 7, B and C). S105-RNase Interacts with NaTrx"

Here, multiple rational design methods were used to engineer ICAM-1 mutants with enhanced affinity for LFA-1. Five amino acid substitutions 1) enhance the hydrophobicity and packing of residues surrounding Glu-34 of ICAM-1, which coordinates to a Mg2+ in the LFA-1 I domain, and 2) alter associations at the edges of the binding interface. The affinity of the most improved ICAM-1 mutant for intermediate- and high-affinity LFA-1 I domains was increased by 19-fold and 22-fold, respectively, relative to wild type. Moreover, potency was similarly enhanced for inhibition of LFA-1-dependent ligand binding and cell adhesion. Thus, rational design can be used to engineer novel adhesion molecules with high monomeric affinity; furthermore, the ICAM-1 mutant holds promise for targeting LFA-1-ICAM-1 interaction for biological studies and therapeutic purposes.

The interaction of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 is critical to many immunological reactions, including T lymphocyte antigen-specific responses and leukocyte accumulation in inflamed tissues (3Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd. Ed. Sambrook and Tooze, New York1999: 216-220Google Scholar). Although the extracellular domains of LFA-1 are composed of the large and complex αL and β2 subunits, the ligand binding site is located exclusively in the inserted (I) domain of αL (4Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Many antagonists of this interaction, including monoclonal antibodies to the I domain of LFA-1 and small molecules, have been developed to treat autoimmune diseases and prevent immune rejection in organ transplantation (5Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 6Curley G.P. Blum H. Humphries M.J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 427-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Whereas all available small molecule antagonists for LFA-1 are allosteric inhibitors, many inhibitory antibodies directly block ligand binding to the I domain (5Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Huang C. Zang Q. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

Engineered high affinity ICAM-1 could serve as a biotherapeutic or a lead molecule in the development of competitive, small molecule agents for treatment of autoimmune diseases. Allostery of LFA-1 on the cell surface, regulated physiologically by inflammatory stimuli and signal transduction through the LFA-1 α and β subunit transmembrane domains, alters affinity for ICAM-1 (5Shimaoka M. Springer T.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Disc. 2003; 2: 703-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In the isolated I domain, mutationally introduced disulfide bonds have been used to stabilize the open conformation with high affinity, the intermediate conformation with intermediate affinity, or the closed conformation with low affinity for ICAM-1 (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A.

A recent crystal structure of the αL I domain in complex with ICAM-1 has revealed the binding interface between the αL I domain and ICAM-1 at 3.3-Å; resolution (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y.

The I domain directly coordinates Glu-34 of ICAM-1 through a Mg2+, and a reorientation of Glu-241 of the I domain creates a critical salt bridge to Lys-39 of ICAM-1 (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H.

Further comparison of liganded and unliganded structures for both high affinity (HA) and intermediate affinity (IA) αL I domains reveals a shape-shifting pathway for integrin regulation by which allosteric signals convert the closed conformation to intermediate or open conformations. Binding of the IA I domain to ICAM-1 stabilizes the same open conformation as seen with the HA I domain (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H. Yang Y. Dong Y. Jun C.-D. McCormack A. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Takagi J. Wang J.-h. Springer T.A. Cell. 2003; 112: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The affinity of the HA αL I domain for wild-type ICAM-1 is low (KD = 185 ± 12 nm) (9Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Enhancement of this affinity is essential for therapeutic applications or for accurate measurement of physiologically induced increase in affinity of LFA-1 on the cell surface.

We have taken multiple structure-based approaches to design ICAM-1 variants with enhanced affinity for αLβ2. Moreover, we have measured the kinetics and affinity of I domains stabilized in different conformations for high affinity ICAM-1 mutants and investigated the inhibitory effects of our most improved variant on binding of ICAM-1 to cell surface αLβ2 and αLβ2-dependent adhesion. Computational Design—The crystal structure of the αL I domain in complex with ICAM-1 (PDB code 1MQ8) was used as the starting template for computational calculations (8Shimaoka M. Xiao T. Liu J.-H.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1106-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) calculations. For PDA calculations, the conformations of amino acids at variable positions were represented as a set of backbone-independent side-chain rotamers derived from the rotamer library of Dunbrack and Cohen (20Dunbrack Jr., R.L. Cohen F.E. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1661-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). The energies of all possible combinations of the considered amino acids at the chosen variable positions were calculated using a force field containing terms describing van der Waals, solvation, electrostatic, and hydrogen bond interactions. The optimal (ground state) sequence was determined using a Dead End Elimination algorithm, and a Monte Carlo algorithm was used to evaluate the energies of similar sequences around the predicted ground state. SPA calculations utilize a genetic algorithm to screen for low energy sequences, with energies being calculated during each round of “evolution” for those sequences being sampled. The conformations of amino acids were represented as a set of side-chain rotamers derived from a backbone-independent rotamer library using a flexible rotamer model (21Mendes J. Baptista A.M. Carrondo M.A. Soares C.M. Proteins. 1999; 37: 530-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SPA calculations generated a list of 300 sequences that were subsequently clustered computationally into groups of similar sequences using a nearest neighbor single linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm. Parameters and other details for PDA and SPA calculations are described elsewhere (13Luo P. Hayes R.J. Chan C. Stark D.M. Hwang M.Y. Jacinto J.M. Juvvadi P. Chung H.S. Kundu A. Ary M.L. Dahiyat B.I.

For these sets of calculations, critical contact residues Glu-34, Lys-39, Asn-68, and Gln-73 were fixed in both sequence and conformation. Calculations were carried out to evaluate single and combinatorial substitutions at variable residues Lys-29, Leu-30, Pro-38, Glu-41, Met-64, Tyr-66, and Thr-75. All residues in contact with these residues were floated, that is the amino acid conformation but not the amino acid identity was allowed to vary to allow for conformational adjustments.

As above, two sets of design calculations were carried out to identify substitutions predicted to stabilize the ICAM-1-I-domain interface. In the first round, only single amino acid substitutions at positions Lys-29, Leu-30, Gly-32, Pro-36, Pro-38, Lys-39, Glu-41, Gln-62, Met-64, Tyr-66, Asn-68, Gly-72, Gln-73, Thr-75, and Lys-77 were modeled. Residue choices evaluated at each position were: Lys-29: Arg, Asp, Glu, and Ser; Leu-30: Asp, Glu, Arg, Lys, Tyr, Trp, and Phe; Gly-32: Ala and Ser; Pro-36: all amino acids; Pro-38: all amino acids; Lys-39: Arg; Glu-41: Arg, Lys, Asp, Ser, and Asn; Gln-62: Arg, Lys, Asp, Glu, Ser, and Asn; Met-64: Leu, Ile, Phe, Tyr, and Val; Tyr-66: Phe and His; Asn-68: Thr, Tyr, Arg, Asp, and Glu; Gly-72: Lys, Arg, Asp, Glu, Asn, Ser, Gln, and Pro; Gln-73: Thr, Asn, Ser, Arg, Asp, and Glu; Thr-75: all residues; and Lys-77: all residues. In a second round, 11 interface residues (Lys-29, Leu-30, Pro-36, Pro-38, Lys-39, Met-64, Tyr-66, Asn-68, Gln-73, Thr-75, and Lys-77) were designed (allowed to change to all 20 naturally occurring amino acids, including the native amino acid type but excluding cysteine) simultaneously. In each case, amino acid side chains contacting the substituted amino acid side chains were repacked (allowing all rotamers of the native amino acid type). Sequences and conformations with low energies were selected using a Monte-Carlo simulated annealing procedure as described previously (24Kuhlman B. Baker D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cDNA was cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET-20b vector. Protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The transformed bacteria were cultured in rich media (20 g/liter Tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, 20 ml/liter glycerol, 50 mm K2HPO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 g/liter glucose, 100 mg/liter ampicillin). Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) to a final concentration of 1 mm when the A600 of cultures was 0.6-1.0. The I domain was refolded and purified as described (9Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R. von Andrian U.H. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) with some modifications in the step of refolding. Briefly, frozen cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, with 1 mg/ml lysozyme at 37 °C for 15 min and then disrupted by ultrasonication. Inclusion bodies were harvested by centrifugation. After extensive washing with washing buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 23% (w/v) sucrose, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA), the pellet was solubilized by adding 6 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol. The I domain was rapidly diluted in a redox buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm cysteamine/2.5 mm cystamine) to a final concentration of 25 μg/ml and then incubated at 4 °C with slow stirring. Refolding was performed for 4-5 days until no free thiol group was detected with 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Pierce). The I domain was precipitated with ammonium sulfate and purified by Superdex S-200 gel-filtration in phosphate-buffered saline. Biotin was ligated to the tag with the BirA ligase (Avidity, Denver, CO). Typically, I domain at a concentration of 1-2 mg/ml was incubated with BirA (15-20 μg/ml) at room temperature overnight in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.3), 10 mm ATP, and 50 μm biotin. The unbound biotin was removed by passing the sample through a Superdex S-200 column (Amersham Biosciences). The biotinylated I domain was mixed with streptavidin-FITC (BIOSOURCE International) or streptavidin (BIOSOURCE International) at a molar ratio of 8:1 for 2 h at 21°C. The mixture was then subjected to Superdex S-200 chromatography in TBS (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) to separate the tetrameric complex peak from free I domain. Immunofluorescent Flow Cytometry—Plasmids encoding full-length ICAM-1 were transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate precipitation (26Lu C. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 268-278PubMed Google Scholar). The mAbs RR1/1, CBR IC1/11, CBR IC1/12, and CA-7 were used to stain transfected cells as described (30Lu C. Oxvig C. Springer T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15138-15147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For soluble I domain tetramer binding, the ICAM-1-transfected cells were washed once with Hanks’ Balanced Salt solution (Invitrogen), 10 mm EDTA, and twice with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (HBS)/5.5% glucose/1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with streptavidin-I domain tetramer (2 μg/ml)/HBS/5.5% glucose/1% bovine serum albumin in the presence of 1 mm Mg2+ at room temperature for 1 h, and washed three times with HBS/1 mm Mg2+. FITC-goat anti-streptavidin (10 μg/ml, Vector Laboratories) and Cy3-labeled CBR IC1/11 (10 μg/ml), a non-blocking antibody to LFA-1 mapped to domain 3 of ICAM-1 (31Parkos C.A. Colgan S.P. Diamond M.S. Nusrat A. Liang T.W. Springer T.A. Madara J.L. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 489-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were added and incubated with the cells on ice for 15 min. After washing three times with HBS/1 mm Mg2+, cells were subjected to fluorescence flow cytometry. Mean FITC fluorescence intensity (MFI) of Cy3-positive cells was determined. In all experiments, background CBR IC1/11 binding to mock transfected cells and background tetramer binding to ICAM-1-transfected cells in the presence of 5 mm EDTA were subtracted to obtain specific ICAM-1 expression and ligand binding, respectively: % binding = (mutant MFI - background MFI)/(wild-type MFI - background MFI) × 100.

ICAM-1 Fc fusion proteins were purified from supernatants on a protein G column (Invitrogen). Contaminating IgGs were removed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). ICAM-1 Fc eluted earlier than IgGs. After thrombin cleavage (1 mg of protein/20 units of thrombin, Amersham Biosciences) at room temperature overnight, soluble ICAM-1 D1-5 was further purified by gel filtration to remove the Fc portion and trace amounts of thrombin. Typical yield was 5 mg/liter. Antibody Binding Assay—Antibody-binding assay for soluble ICAM-1-Fc was performed as described (36Jun C.-D. Shimaoka M. Carman C.V. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl.

Surface Plasmon Resonance—ICAM surfaces or a control surface were prepared by injecting ICAMs (20 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) or buffer only (control) over the flow cells activated with N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide and then blocking these surfaces with ethanolamine. To prepare I domain surfaces, biotinylated HA I domain (20 μg/ml) or 5 μm biotin as control in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) was directly captured on a streptavidin-conjugated sensor chip (Biacore) using 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (HBS-N, Biacore) as running buffer. I domains or ICAMs were infused in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and regeneration was done in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.3 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA. The KD value was calculated by curve fitting with Langmuir 1:1 binding model or Scatchard analysis if the binding reached steady-state. koff was derived from curve fitting on the dissociation phases. kon was calculated as koff/KD. Soluble ICAM-1 Binding—Binding of soluble, multimeric ICAM-1-IgA-Fc/FITC-anti-IgA to K562 cells expressing wild-type LFA-1 was as described previously (37Shimaoka M. Salas A. Yang W. Weitz-Schmidt G.

https://openalex.org/W1992721475,"Ca2 binding proteins such as calretinin, characterized by the presence of EF-hand motifs that bind Ca2+ ions, are involved in the shaping of intraneuronal Ca2+ fluxes. In the cerebellar cortex, information processing tightly relies on variations in intracellular Ca2+ concentration in Purkinje and granule cells. Calretinin-deficient (Cr-/-) mice present motor discoordination, suggesting cellular and network cerebellar dysfunctions. To determine the cell specificity of these alterations, we constructed transgenic Cr-/- mice exhibiting a selective reexpression of calretinin in granule cells through the promoter function of the GABAA receptor alpha6 subunit gene. Normal granule cell excitability and wild-type Purkinje cell firing behavior in awake mice were restored while the emergence of high-frequency oscillations was abolished. Behavioral analysis of these calretinin-rescue mice revealed that normal motor coordination was restored as compared with Cr-/- mice. These results demonstrate that calretinin is required specifically in granule cells for correct computation in the cerebellar cortex and indicate that the finetuning of granule cell excitability through regulation of Ca2+ homeostasis plays a crucial role for information coding and storage in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2005023452,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces a large number of structurally diverse lipids generated from the carboxylation products of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. A biotin-dependent acyl-CoA carboxylase was purified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv by avidin affinity chromatography, and the three major protein components were determined by N-terminal sequencing to be the 63-kDa α3-subunit (AccA3, Rv3285), the 59-kDa β5-subunit (AccD5, Rv3280), and the 56-kDa β4-subunit (AccD4, Rv3799). A minor protein of about 24 kDa that co-purified with the above subunits was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to be the product of Rv3281 that is located immediately downstream of the open reading frame encoding the β5-subunit. This protein displays identity over a short stretch of amino acids with the recently discovered ϵ-subunits of Streptomyces coelicolor, suggesting that it might be an ϵ-subunit of the mycobacterial acyl-CoA carboxylase. To test this hypothesis, the carboxylase subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Acyl-CoA carboxylase activity was successfully reconstituted for the first time from purified subunits of the acyl-CoA carboxylase of M. tuberculosis. The reconstituted α3-β5 showed higher activity with propionyl-CoA than with acetyl-CoA, and the addition of the ϵ-subunit stimulated the carboxylation by 3.2- and 6.3-fold, respectively. The α3-β4 showed very low activity with the above substrates but carboxylated long chain acyl-CoA. This ϵ-subunit contains five sets of tandem repeats at the N terminus that are required for maximal enhancement of carboxylase activity. The Rv3281 open reading frame is co-transcribed with Rv3280 in the mycobacterial cell, and the level of ϵ-protein was highest during the log phase and decreased during the stationary phase.

Biotin-dependent carboxylases are involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA. Most biotin-dependent enzymes contain three functional components: the biotin carboxylase (BC), 2The abbreviations used are: BC, biotin carboxylase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; CT, carboxyltransferase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ORF, open reading frame; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcriptase; SC, specificity constant; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: BC, biotin carboxylase; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; CT, carboxyltransferase; PCC, propionyl-CoA carboxylase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; ORF, open reading frame; MALDI-TOF MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; RT, reverse transcriptase; SC, specificity constant; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and the carboxyltransferase (CT) (1.Cronan Jr., J.E. Waldrop G.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 2002; 41: 407-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The acyl-CoA carboxylation reaction occurs in two steps in two separate subsites of the enzyme. The first partial reaction involves the fixation of CO2 on biotin and requires the cooperation of BC and BCCP components; the biotin group is moved to interact with the BC component, resulting in the formation of carboxyl biotin. This carboxyl biotin then swings out to the carboxyltransferase component, resulting in the formation of the carboxylated product (2.Attwood P.V. Wallace J.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002; 35: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Acyl-CoA carboxylases from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG have been purified previously and shown to have both propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activities (3.Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 905-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mycobacterium smegmatis PCC was reported to be composed of two subunits with the biotin being associated with the heavier subunit (4.Henrikson K.P. Allen S.H.G. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 905-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis has three accA genes annotated as an α-subunit that contains the BC and BCCP domains and six accD genes annotated as β-subunits that comprise the CT domain (6.Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T.

Squares S. Sulston J.E. Taylor K. Whitehead S. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6501) Google Scholar). It is not known which of these genes are expressed in M. tuberculosis. The acyl-CoA selectivity of the CT domain in the different β-subunits also remains unclear. Isolation of the various subunits and reconstitution of active carboxylase would be required to examine the catalytic activities of the various gene products. However, there are no reports of reconstitution of active acyl-CoA carboxylase from purified subunits of the M. tuberculosis acyl-CoA carboxylase. Recently, a new group of acyl-CoA carboxylases was identified in S. coelicolor that contained a third type of subunit, designated ϵ. The ϵ-subunit considerably enhanced the basal activity obtained with the α- and β-subunits from this organism (7.Rodríguez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Diacovich L. Peirú S. Kurth D. Rodríguez E. Podestá F. Khosla C. Gramajo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is not known whether the mycobacterial carboxylase belongs to this new group. In the genome of M. tuberculosis, an open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to an ϵ-subunit has not been identified, and the purified carboxylase from the pathogen has not been thoroughly examined for subunit composition. We report the identification of an ϵ-like ORF adjacent to the β5 ORF (Rv3280) and present evidence for the expression of this ORF in M. tuberculosis. MALDI-TOF MS analysis of a 24-kDa protein that was purified with the native carboxylase by avidin-affinity chromatography showed it to be the ϵ-subunit of the carboxylase. We also showed that ACCA3, ACCD4, and ACCD5 are the major subunits of the native carboxylase. Reconstitution of active carboxylase from expressed and purified subunits showed that the ϵ-subunit stimulates carboxylation by α3-β5, demonstrating that M. tuberculosis has a novel carboxylase similar to that in S. coelicolor. Materials—Sodium [14C]bicarbonate (50 Ci mol–1) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., and all other chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade and were purchased from Sigma and Fisher. Nucleotide primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Bacterial Strains, Culture, and Transformation Conditions—Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for routine subcloning and was transformed according to Sambrook et al. (9.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) and E. coli Rosetta (DE3) were used for expression of recombinant proteins (10.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). All media were purchased from Difco. Host strains for cloning and expression experiments were grown on Luria Bertani (LB) broth or agar. Ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and kanamycin were added when required at final concentrations of 100, 34, and 50 μgml–1, respectively. Growth Conditions, Protein Production, and Preparation of Cell-free Extracts—For expression of heterologous proteins, E. coli strains harboring the appropriate plasmids were grown at 37 °C in LB medium in the presence of the corresponding antibiotics for plasmid maintenance. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100 in fresh medium, grown to A600 0.8, and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at the same temperature with shaking. E. coli BL21 transformed with pCY216 (11.Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which expresses the E. coli biotin ligase (BirA), was grown under the same conditions as above and induced by the addition of arabinose to a final concentration of 0.5%. The cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 1× equilibration/wash buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm sodium phosphate and 300 mm NaCl and were disrupted by sonication using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as the cell-free extract. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Cell-free extracts and purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206965) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (13.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215491) Google Scholar). To detect His-tagged protein and biotin-containing proteins, Western blot analyses were carried out with His probe (H-3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and peroxidase-conjugated avidin (Pierce), respectively. For Western blotting, cell extracts or purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by using Trans-blot Cell from Bio-Rad. Antibody Production and ϵ-Protein Expression in M. tuberculosis— The purified 177-residue ϵ-subunit was resolved on SDS-PAGE and used for raising antibodies in rabbit by Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc (Madison, WI) according to their standard 73-day protocol. M. tuberculosis H37Rv cultures were grown aerobically in roller cultures in 7H9 medium at 37 °C. Equal quantities of cell lysates from 3-, 5-, 7-, and 9-day-old cultures were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and were transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blot was probed with antisera raised as described above, and the bands were quantitated on an AlphaImager Gel Doc system. Avidin Affinity Chromatography and Electrophoresis—Acyl-CoA carboxylase was purified by avidin affinity chromatography as described previously (3.Rainwater D.L. Kolattukudy P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 905-911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis H37Rv inactivated by γ irradiation (obtained from Colorado State University, TB Research Materials and Vaccine Testing Contract NIAID, National Institutes of Health, NO1 AI-753230) were disrupted by a French pressure cell operating at 15,000 p.s.i. (passed four times) in 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mm dithioerythritol, 1.0 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Just before each passage, 50 μl of 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in isopropyl alcohol was added to inhibit proteases. The homogenate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was then centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 90 min. The final supernatant was mixed with a monomeric avidin-Sepharose affinity resin; the mixture was stirred slowly for 1 h, and the gel was poured into a column. The gel was washed with 5 bed volumes of the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min, and a linear gradient of 0–0.2 mm d-biotin in the phosphate buffer in a total volume of 300 ml was applied. The fractions (5.0 ml) containing the highest carboxylase activity were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using Amicon PM-3 membrane. To determine the N-terminal protein sequence, the separated proteins from 7.5% SDS-PAGE were transferred on Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in 10 mm CAPS buffer (pH 11.0) with 10% methanol. After staining with Coomassie Blue, N-terminal sequence of each protein band was determined by automated Edman degradation on a protein sequencer (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH). The ϵ-like proteins were resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS following tryptic digestion. Gene Cloning and Plasmid Constructions—DNA corresponding to each carboxylase subunit ORF was amplified using Pfu Turbo Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene), and expression was performed using the pET expression vector (Novagen). The primers used for amplification of the genes Rv3285 (α3), Rv3799c (β4), Rv3280 (β5), and Rv3281 (ϵ) are listed in Table 1. All of the PCR products were cloned using the PCR-BluntII TOPO vector into E. coli TOP10 competent cells. These inserts were released by digestion as described by Table 1 and subcloned in pET16b or pET28a (+) vectors. Rv3285, Rv3799c, and Rv3280 were expressed in pET16b, and Rv3281 was expressed in pET28a (+). In these vectors, the ORFs were directionally cloned and expressed as His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) or E. coli Rosetta (DE3).TABLE 1Primers used for this studyPrimer nameSequenceaEndonuclease restriction sites added to sequences are underlined.

Open table in a new tab Purification of Expressed Proteins—The E. coli strain BL21 star (DE3) containing the plasmids pTJA3 (α3), pTJD4 (β4), and pTJD5 (β5) were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for protein overexpression as described above. Following lysis, the 16,000 × g supernatants were mixed with TALON resin (BD Biosciences) at room temperature for 30 min to allow the polyhistidine-tagged protein to bind the resin. The His-tagged fusion proteins were recovered by elution with 100 mm imidazole for the α3- and β4-subunits or 500 mm imidazole for the β5-subunits. For biotinylation of the cloned α3-subunit, E. coli cell lysate containing the expressed α3-subunit was incubated with an extract of E. coli cells expressing the cloned E. coli biotin ligase (BirA) from the pCY216 plasmid at 30 °C for 3 h (11.Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of the α3-subunit was confirmed by Western blotting with avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) was used for expression of pTJE1 and pTJE102. The His-tagged ϵ-proteins were insoluble and were solubilized with 6 m guanidine-HCl from the 16,000 × g pellet obtained from cell lysate. The solubilized proteins were bound to TALON resin, which was pre-equilibrated in 6 m guanidine-HCl, and were purified under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following elution with 150 mm imidazole, the guanidine-HCl was removed, and the purified ϵ-proteins were refolded by stepwise dialysis. The first step of dialysis was performed against a solution containing 2 m guanidine-HCl, 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0), and 10% glycerol for 12 h at 4 °C followed by two rounds of dialysis against 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0) and 10% glycerol for 12 h at 4 °C. Reconstitution of Carboxylase Activity—The purified ϵ-subunit in dilute form (100 μg/ml) was initially combined with a dilute (100 μg/ml) preparation of either the β4- or the β5-subunits, after which the β-ϵ subunits were combined with a dilute preparation of the biotinylated α3-subunit. Following this, the reconstituted enzyme was concentrated 5–7-fold by ultrafiltration in Centriprep YM-10 filters (Millipore) at 700 × g for 6 h at 4 °C. Acyl-CoA Carboxylase Assay—Enzyme activities of the in vitro reconstituted subunits obtained by mixing purified proteins were measured by following the incorporation of label from H14VCO–3 into acid-stable reaction material (14.Hunaiti A.R. Kolattukudy P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 216: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH14CO3 (50 Ci mol–1), 2 mm acetyl-CoA, 2 mm propionyl-CoA, and 200–600 μg of reconstituted enzyme in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NaH14CO3, allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 3 h, and stopped with 150 μl of 6 m HCl. Following evaporation, the residue was resuspended in 100 μl of water, and the 14C radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To determine the effect of inhibitors on acyl-CoA carboxylase activity, the reconstituted enzyme was incubated with the inhibitor for 30 min at room temperature prior to the assay described above. Avidin Purification and Identification of the Native Carboxylase Subunits—The carboxylases purified from M. tuberculosis H37Rv by avidin affinity chromatography showed activity with both acetyl-CoA (12.3 nmol/mg/min) and propionyl-CoA (20.6 nmol/mg/min) as substrates. When the purified native carboxylase preparation from M. tuberculosis was resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, three proteins with apparent molecular masses of 63, 59, and 56 kDa were observed. The N-terminal amino acid sequence determination revealed them as being the products of Rv3285 (AccA3, α3; ASHAGSRIARISK, lacking the terminal methionine), Rv3280 (AccD5, β5; TSVTDRSAHSAER, lacking the terminal methionine), and Rv3799c (AccD4, β4; VTEPVL, lacking 2 N-terminal amino acids) (Fig. 1A). We expressed the α3-, β4-, and β5-subunits as His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli. The biotinylated α3-subunit was purified and mixed with the purified β4- or β5-subunit and assayed for carboxylation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. The reconstituted enzyme showed only very low activity but appeared to support the conclusion that the β5-subunit preferred propionyl-CoA. The low activity observed with the purified subunits made us wonder whether we were missing another component that might be required for effective carboxylation. At this time, a novel class of carboxylase that requires an additional ϵ-subunit for activity was described in S. coelicolor (7.Rodríguez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Diacovich L. Peirú S. Kurth D. Rodríguez E. Podestá F. Khosla C. Gramajo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We used the most conserved segments of the four ϵ-subunits found in Streptomyces to search the mycobacterial genome. We discovered that a segment of a hypothetical protein downstream of accD5 showed homology to the conserved region of the ϵ-subunit of Streptomyces. To determine whether the native carboxylase contained an ϵ-subunit protein, the purified native carboxylase preparation was resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. In addition to α3, β4, and β5, a 24-kDa band was observed (Fig. 1A). MALDI-TOF MS analysis following trypsin digestion revealed a sequence, VSGT-NEVSDGNE, which we identified as the product of the Rv3281 ORF lacking 17 N-terminal amino acids. The presence of a trypsin cleavage site immediately upstream of this peptide may explain the absence of the N-terminal end. Interestingly, Rv3281 is located immediately downstream of the ORF encoding the AccD5 (β5, Rv3280), as shown in Fig. 1B. Since this suggested a potential role for Rv3281 gene product in carboxylation involving the β5-subunit, we examined the role of Rv3281 in acyl-CoA carboxylation. ϵ Transcript and Protein Expression in M. tuberculosis—To test whether the putative ϵ-subunit of M. tuberculosis is expressed in the pathogen, semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of the transcripts was done. RT-PCR data clearly showed that the ORF encoding the ϵ-subunit is transcribed in the mycobacterial cell. RT-PCR analysis with primers spanning the β5-ϵ junction yielded a product expected if both ORFs were transcribed as one unit (Fig. 2A). We assayed the ϵ-protein expression level in cultures of M. tuberculosis using rabbit antisera raised against the ϵ-protein expressed in E. coli. The protein level was maximal at 5 days of growth when the culture was in its exponential growth phase and declined when the culture entered late log and stationary phase (Fig. 2B). In Vitro Reconstitution of Carboxylase Activity with the Purified Subunits—To examine the possible role of Rv3281 in the carboxylation reaction involving the α3-, β4-, and β5-subunits, we expressed α3-, β4-, β5-, and ϵ-subunits as His-tagged fusion proteins in E. coli and purified them (Fig. 3A). Biotinylation of the expressed α3-subunit was performed with the expressed E. coli biotin ligase, and successful biotinylation of the α3-subunit was confirmed by Western blotting using the avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (data not shown). The biotinylated α3-subunit was purified and mixed with the purified β4- or β5-subunit and assayed for carboxylation of acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA. In our initial reconstitution experiments, the expressed and purified subunits were mixed together after concentration of individual subunits. These preparations showed very low acyl-CoA carboxylase activities. When we analyzed the concentrated subunits by Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography, we found that the individual concentrated subunits were in aggregated forms; aggregation would prevent interaction with other subunits and thus hinder successful reconstitution. Attempts to mix the aggregated forms under denaturing conditions in 6 m urea followed by renaturation of the subunits by stepwise dialysis yielded extremely low carboxylase activity. Therefore, individual subunits were purified by cobalt affinity chromatography, and the dilute subunit preparations were mixed prior to concentration. The purified ϵ-subunit in dilute form was initially combined with the dilute solution of either the β4- or the β5-subunits before the addition of a dilute preparation of the biotinylated α3-subunit followed by concentration by ultrafiltration. Such a reconstitution protocol yielded high levels of carboxylase activity with the α3-β5-ϵ when acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA was used as the substrate. As shown in Fig. 3B, the reconstituted α3-β5 showed nearly 3-fold higher activity with propionyl-CoA when compared with acetyl-CoA. However, when reconstituted with the ϵ-subunit, the α3-β5-ϵ gave 6.3-fold increased ACC activity. The PCC activity increased only 3.2-fold with the inclusion of the ϵ-subunit. The reconstituted α3-β4 and α3-β4-ϵ showed very low carboxylase activity with either substrate. α3-β4 and α3-β5 catalyzed carboxylation of long chain fatty acyl-CoA, and avidin completely inhibited this carboxylation. This carboxylation was not affected by the addition of the ϵ-subunit (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that the ϵ-subunit interacts with only the β5-subunit and modulates its carboxylase activity for acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA. Characterization of the ϵ-Subunit (Rv3281)—An analysis of the amino acid sequence of the ϵ-subunit revealed a low level of identity at the C terminus with the reported ϵ-subunit of S. coelicolor (7.Rodríguez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Diacovich L. Peirú S. Kurth D. Rodríguez E. Podestá F. Khosla C. Gramajo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, the M. tuberculosis ϵ-subunit has five sets of the repeated amino acids ((N/A)EVSDGNETNNP) at the N terminus that are not found in the S. coelicolor ϵ-subunits (CAC21625 and CAA19984). To determine whether the N-terminal repeated amino acids were important for activity, we cloned a truncated version of the ϵ-subunit that contained only the C-terminal portion that showed homology with S. coelicolor ϵ-subunit. When the full-length (ϵ) or truncated (ϵmut) versions of the ϵ-subunit were used for reconstitution with the α3- and β5-subunits and assayed for acyl-CoA carboxylase activities with acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA, the truncated ϵ-subunit showed very much less stimulation of the carboxylase activity when compared with the full-length ϵ-subunit, indicating that N-terminal repeats in the M. tuberculosis ϵ-subunit are important for carboxylase activity (Fig. 4B). Determination of Optimal Stoichiometry of Expressed Subunits—The optimal stoichiometric combination of the α3-, β5-, and ϵ-subunits was determined by following the reconstitution procedure described above with various molar concentrations of each subunit followed by the standard carboxylation assay with acetyl- or propionyl-CoA. The highest carboxylation activity was obtained when the molar ratios of α3, β5, and ϵ were 1:1:2 (Fig. 5). Kinetic Characterization of α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ—The time course of acyl-CoA carboxylation with the reconstituted α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ was determined at 30 °C. As shown in Fig. 6, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylation increased with incubation times up to 3 h. The dependence of the acyl-CoA carboxylase activities of the reconstituted enzyme on the concentration of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, bicarbonate, ATP, and MgCl2 was investigated as shown in Fig. 7. The reconstituted carboxylase exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics as shown Table 2. The α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ showed specificity constants (SC, Vmax/Km) of 1.3 and 7.2 for acetyl-CoA substrate and 10.4 and 14.8 for propionyl-CoA substrate, respectively (Table 2). These results confirmed that ϵ-subunit increased the SC of the α3-β5 for acetyl-CoA by 5.5-fold, whereas the SC for propionyl-CoA was increased only 1.4-fold.FIGURE 7Substrate concentration dependence of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA carboxylase activities of α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ.

When the purified reconstituted α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ were incubated with avidin, the ACC and PCC activities were also completely inhibited as expected (Fig. 8). Acetyl-CoA carboxylation by α3-β5 and α3-β5-ϵ was inhibited by 90% with 100 μm diclofop when compared with the solvent (Me2SO) control. In contrast, propionyl-CoA carboxylase activity showed only 30% inhibition (Fig. 8). Malonyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA are products of the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, respectively, by an acyl-CoA carboxylase. Such acyl-CoA carboxylases, in most organisms, are composed of the α-subunit, which contains the BC and BCCP domains and the β-subunit, which contains the CT domain. In the M. tuberculosis genome, where the genes involved in lipid metabolism are abundant, there are three genes encoding the putative α-subunits and six genes encoding the putative β-subunits of the acyl-CoA carboxylases (6.Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K.

It is not known which ORFs encode the subunits of the native acyl-CoA carboxylase. We identified the three major proteins in our avidin-purified M. tuberculosis acyl-CoA carboxylase preparation as the α3-, β4-, and β5-subunits by N-terminal sequencing. Recently, a new group of acyl-CoA carboxylases was discovered in S. coelicolor, which contained a third type of subunit designated as ϵ in addition to the α- and β-subunits (7.Rodríguez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Diacovich L. Peirú S. Kurth D. Rodríguez E. Podestá F. Khosla C. Gramajo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the ORF encoding the β5-subunit, an ORF that has not been annotated in the mycobacterial genome (Rv3281) was found, the product of which showed homology with the recently identified ϵ-subunit of Streptomyces. We also identified a novel 24-kDa protein in the native carboxylase preparation and determined that it was the product of Rv3281. To understand the nature of the biotin-dependent enzymes, we analyzed the amino acid sequence similarity between each similarly functioning domain of the M. tuberculosis carboxylase with other reported ACC and PCC protein sequences. As the biotin-dependent enzymes share similar reaction mechanisms, these enzymes also share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1B, the domain organization of M. tuberculosis ACC/PCC is similar to that of the PCC and ACC of S. coelicolor (7.Rodríguez E. Banchio C. Diacovich L. Bibb M.J. Gramajo H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4166-4176Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8.Diacovich L. Peirú S. Kurth D. Rodríguez E. Podestá F. Khosla C. Gramajo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31228-31236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The first half of M. tuberculosis AccA3 is composed of the BC that catalyzes the ATP-driven carboxylation of biotin to form carboxybiotin, and the amino acid sequence displays a high degree of homology with the N-terminal domain of the α-subunit (AccA2) of ACC and PCC from S. coelicolor. The other half of M. tuberculosis AccA3 is the BCCP domain that is found in all biotin-dependent enzymes, and this domain functions in transferring CO2 from one subsite to another, allowing carboxylation, and the amino acid sequence shows high homology with the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit (AccA2) of ACC and PCC from S. coelicolor. The amino acid sequence of M. tuberculosis AccA3 showed 68% identity with AccA2 of S. coelicolor. The M. tuberculosis AccD5 is most similar to the S. coelicolor PccB (67% identity), and the M. tuberculosis AccD4 also has similarity to PccB (49% identity) and AccB (44% identity) of S. coelicolor. There are significant differences between the M. tuberculosis ϵ-subunit and the S. coelicolor ϵ-subunits. The M. tuberculosis genome contains only one ORF encoding an ϵ-subunit, whereas in the case of S. coelicolor, there are two ϵ-subunits, AccE and PccE, which interact specifically with the AccB and PccB, respectively. The M. tuberculosis ϵ-subunit is larger (177 amino acids) than its counterparts in S. coelicolor (65–69 amino acids) and contains a set of five tandem repeats of 12 amino acids each at the N terminus, which is not seen in the S. coelicolor ϵ-subunits. We determined that the N-terminal tandem repeats were important for activity and probably stabilize the protein-protein interactions between the α3-, β5-, and ϵ-subunits. Although the α3-β5-ϵ of M. tuberculosis belongs to the new group of acyl-CoA carboxylases found in S. coelicolor, there were substantial differences in the kinetic parameters between the two. The SC of the M. tuberculosis α3-β5-ϵ for acetyl-CoA was nearly 2-fold lower than the value for propionyl-CoA (Table 2). In contrast, the SC of the S. coelicolor ACC for acetyl-CoA was nearly 3-fold lower than that of the PCC for propionyl-CoA, and no activity was detected with the PCC when acetyl-CoA was used as substrate (8.Diacovich L.

Furthermore, the reconstituted M. tuberculosis acyl-CoA carboxylase yielded the highest activity when the ratio of the α3-, β5-, and ϵ-subunits was 1:1:2, whereas in the case of S. coelicolor, near maximal velocity was obtained when the ratio of the subunits was 1:1:3 for AccE and 1:1:9 for PccE (8.Diacovich L.

Mutagenesis studies on related bacteria suggest that accD4 is involved in carboxylation of long chain acids required for mycolic acid synthesis, consistent with the finding that it was an essential gene in M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (15.Portevin D. de Sousa-D'Auria C.

In agreement with these reports, the reconstituted α3-β4 of M. tuberculosis carboxylated long chain fatty acyl-CoA in an ϵ-independent manner. The mycobacterial cell wall is rich in unusual lipids that are known to play critical roles in pathogenesis. Methylmalonyl-CoA is the unique precursor of the multiple methyl-branched lipids that have been shown to function as virulence factors, and its synthesis is a potential drug target. It is expected that the mycobacterium may require higher levels of n-fatty acids during its exponential growth phase and, as it enters the stationary phase, higher levels of branched fatty acids may be required for modifications of the cell wall. Our data indicated that expression of the ϵ-protein in the mycobacterial cell reaches its highest level during the exponential growth phase and decreases during the stationary phase. During the exponential phase, when n-acyl lipids are synthesized from malonyl-CoA, the ACC activity of the carboxylase needs to be increased, and that may be done by increased levels of the ϵ-subunit, which appears to favor the ACC activity. When branched lipids are required during the stationary phase, the PCC activity of the carboxylase may be favored by decreasing the expression of the ϵ-subunit. Commercial herbicides such as diclofop, haloxyfop, and sethoxydim are potent inhibitors of ACC in plants and have been shown to act on the CT domain (18.Zhang H. Tweel B. Tong L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 5910-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our studies with the reconstituted α3-β5-ϵ showed that diclofop inhibited the ACC activity almost completely. Since there is no report on the inhibition of PCC activity with such inhibitors, we examined whether the PCC activity of our reconstituted carboxylase was sensitive to inhibition by diclofop. We found that the PCC activity of the α3-β5-ϵ was inhibited by a much lesser degree by diclofop, suggesting that the inhibitor may distinguish the binding sites for acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA on the CT domain of the β5-subunit. Further studies with inhibitors of the α3-β5-ϵ may provide leads for drug development. M. tuberculosis and M. bovis have three α-subunit genes and six β-subunit genes, but Mycobacterium leprae, which is known to have lost a substantial part of the original mycobacterial genome, has one α-subunit gene, three β-subunit genes, and one ϵ-subunit gene (19.Cole S.T.

The organization of the ORFs for the α3-, β5-, and ϵ-subunits and that of the biotin ligase (birA) in the genomes of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis CDC1551, M. bovis, M. leprae, and M. smegmatis is nearly identical in all these organisms and, in each case, the ϵ-subunit is located immediately downstream of the β5-subunit (Fig. 9). This conservation indicates that the ϵ-subunit probably plays an important role in the carboxylation reaction in all these species. Therefore, further study of its role may lead to deeper understanding of the acyl-CoA carboxylases in mycobacteria. We thank Prof. John E. Cronan, Jr. for kindly providing us the pCY216 plasmid."

VDAC bound to reactive red 120-agarose, from which it was eluted by ATP, less effectively by ADP and AMP, but not by NADH. The photoreactive ATP analog, benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP (BzATP), was used to identify and characterize the ATP-binding sites in VDAC. [α-32P]BzATP bound to purified VDAC at two or more binding sites with apparent high and low binding affinities. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis of BzATP-labeled VDAC confirmed the binding of at least two BzATP molecules to VDAC. The VDAC BzATP-binding sites showed higher specificity for purine than for pyrimidine nucleotides and higher affinity for negatively charged nucleotide species. VDAC treatment with the lysyl residue modifying reagent, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate, markedly inhibited VDAC labeling with BzATP. The VDAC nucleotide-binding sites were localized using chemical and enzymatic cleavage. Digestion of [α-32P]BzATP-labeled VDAC with CNBr or V8 protease resulted in the appearance of ∼17- and ∼14-kDa labeled fragments. Further digestion, high performance liquid chromatography separation, and sequencing of the selected V8 peptides suggested that the labeled fragments originated from two different regions of the VDAC molecule. MALDI-TOF analysis of BzATP-labeled, tryptic VDAC fragments indicated and localized three nucleotide binding sites, two of which were at the N and C termini of VDAC. Thus, the presence of two or more nucleotide-binding sites in VDAC is suggested, and their possible function in the control of VDAC activity, and, thereby, of outer mitochondrial membrane permeability is discussed.

It has recently been recognized that there exists a metabolic coupling between the cytosol and the mitochondria, with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), 2The abbreviations used are: OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PTP, permeability transition pore; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; NBS(s), nucleotide binding site(s); RRA, reactive red 120-agarose; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; V8, Staphylococcus aureus protease; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate; HA, hydroxyapatite; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. 2The abbreviations used are: OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; VDAC, voltage-dependent anion channel; PTP, permeability transition pore; ANT, adenine nucleotide translocase; NBS(s), nucleotide binding site(s); RRA, reactive red 120-agarose; FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; V8, Staphylococcus aureus protease; BzATP, 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl adenosine 5′-triphosphate; HA, hydroxyapatite; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. the boundary between these compartments, fulfilling an important function in this coupling (1Brown G.C.

In the cross-talk between mitochondria and cytosol, mitochondrial ATP and Ca2+ play major roles. As the primary transporter of nucleotides, Ca2+, and other ions and metabolites across the OMM (reviewed in Refs. 5Shoshan-Barmatz V. Gincel D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar and 6Colombini M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; (107-115): 256-257Google Scholar), the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) mediates a substantial portion of the OMM molecular traffic. It has been demonstrated that VDAC is permeable to Ca2+ and possesses Ca2+-binding sites that control its activity (reviewed in Ref. 5Shoshan-Barmatz V. Gincel D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). VDAC permeability is also regulated by associated protein(s) (reviewed in Refs. 5Shoshan-Barmatz V. Gincel D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 6Colombini M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; (107-115): 256-257Google Scholar, 7Shoshan-Barmatz V. Israelson A. J. Membr.

Thus, by providing the pathway for anions, cations, ATP, and other metabolites into and out of the mitochondria, as well as possessing ligand-binding sites, VDAC plays an important role in the regulation of mitochondrial functions. Indeed, VDAC has been suggested to control OMM permeability, coupled respiration, and cell survival (3Lee A.C. Xu X. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26724-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Vander-Heiden M.G. Li X.X. Gottleib E. Hill R.B. Thompson C.B. Colombini M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1992; 1098: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that activation of the Ca2+-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) is a key event committing the cell to an apoptotic fate (reviewed in Refs. 9Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar, 10Crompton M. Biochem.

The PTP is a regulated, high-conductance, nonspecific channel, which has been suggested to be composed of VDAC, located at the OMM, the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), located at the inner mitochondrial membrane, and cyclophilin D, located at the matrix (9Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar, 12Crompton M. Virji S. Ward J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 729-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). ATP and ADP inhibition of the PTP opening has prevalently been thought to be exerted via their interaction with the ANT (9Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). However, there is also evidence for the involvement of a second adenine nucleotide-binding site, having different affinity, in PTP regulation (Refs. 13Lapidus R.G. Sokolove P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18931-18936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Novgorodov S.A. Gudz T.I. Brierley G.P. Pfeiffer D.R. Arch. Biochem.

Moreover, not only matrix ADP, but also external ADP affects PTP opening (see in Refs. 9Zoratti M. Szabo I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 139-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar and 10Crompton M. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 233-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of a cytoplasmically facing nucleotide-binding site(s) (NBS) in the modulation of PTP opening. As a mitochondrial protein facing the cytoplasm and as a PTP component, VDAC is a possible target for nucleotides regulating the PTP opening. However, direct demonstration of the presence of nucleotide-binding properties in VDAC is lacking thus far. The transport of adenine nucleotides via VDAC has been demonstrated using isolated mitochondria (3Lee A.C. Xu X. Colombini M. J. Biol.

Acta. 1993; 1145: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) or into a planar lipid bilayer (19Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. Biophys.

NADH was found to regulate the gating of mammalian, fungal, and plant VDACs (3Lee A.C. Xu X. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26724-26731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 22Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ATP was shown to modify Neurospora crassa VDAC channel conductance in a biphasic manner, leading to the suggestion that VDAC contains at least one binding site for purine nucleotides, located inside the pore of the channel (19Rostovtseva T. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1954-1962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 20Rostovtseva T.K. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2365-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Additionally, mammalian VDAC binds to ATP-agarose resin and is eluted from it with ATP (23Florke H. Thinnes F.P. Winkelbach H. Stadtmuller U. Paetzold G. Morys-Wortmann C. Hesse D. Sternbach H. Zimmermann B. Kaufmann-Kolle P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Molecular and biochemical evidence also indicate that VDAC possesses one or more NBS (22Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Florke H. Thinnes F.P. Winkelbach H. Stadtmuller U. Paetzold G. Morys-Wortmann C. Hesse D. Sternbach H. Zimmermann B. Kaufmann-Kolle P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Based on homology with known nucleotide-binding sequences, Zizi et al. (22Zizi M. Forte M. Blachly-Dyson E. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1614-1616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed a C-terminal NBS in mammalian and fungal VDACs, and a possible N-terminal NBS in mammalian (but not fungal) VDAC. The latter suggestion is supported by [32P]ATP labeling of mammalian VDAC and a human VDAC fragment containing the putative N-terminal NBS (GYGFG) (23Florke H. Thinnes F.P. Winkelbach H. Stadtmuller U. Paetzold G. Morys-Wortmann C. Hesse D. Sternbach H. Zimmermann B. Kaufmann-Kolle P. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, characterization and precise location of the VDAC NBSs have not yet been presented. Accordingly, in this study, several approaches, including photoaffinity labeling with the ATP analog, benzoyl-benzoyl-ATP (BzATP) and mass spectral analysis, were used to identify at least two NBSs in VDAC, characterize their binding properties, and localize them within the VDAC molecule. The possible function of these sites in the regulation of OMM permeability is discussed. Materials—Cyanogen bromide (CNBr), reactive red 120-agarose (RRA), EGTA, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC), Mops, nucleotides, Tris, trypsin, and Staphylococcus aureus protease (V8) were obtained from Sigma. Hydroxyapatite (Bio-Gel HTP) was purchased from Bio-Rad and celite was obtained from the British Drug Houses (United Kingdom). Radiolabeled 3′-O-(4-benzoyl)-benzoyl-ATP ([α-32P]BzATP) was synthesized and purified as described by Williams and Coleman (24Williams N. Coleman P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2834-2841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications to scale down the amount of BzATP synthesized. Mitochondria and VDAC Purification—Mitochondria were isolated from rat liver as described previously (25Johnson D. Lardy H. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 94-96Crossref Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), except that 0.1 mm phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin were added to all solutions as protease inhibitors. VDAC was purified from rat liver mitochondria by two-step chromatography using hydroxyapatite (HA): celite and RRA in the presence of Triton X-100, as previously described (5Shoshan-Barmatz V. Gincel D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Purified VDAC, eluted from the RRA with a solution containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 0.4 m NaCl, was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, to avoid salt interference with subsequent BzATP labeling (see “Results”). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined using the biuret method, and VDAC concentration by densitometric estimation of Coomassie Blue-stained gel bands (using ovalbumin as a standard). It should be noted that the VDAC preparations mostly contain VDAC1 (see Ref. 26Huizing M. Ruitenbeek W. van den Heuvel L.P. Dolce V. Iacobazzi V. Smeitink J.A. Palmieri F. Trijbels J.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar; as also supported by the mass spectral analyses described below). Photoaffinity Labeling by [α-32P]BzATP—Mitochondria (1 mg/ml) or purified VDAC (∼0.1 mg/ml) were irradiated with a 15 watt ultraviolet lamp for 3 min in the presence of 0.2-500 μm [α-32P]BzATP (4 × 106 to 107 cpm/nmol) in 40 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The UV-irradiated samples were immediately diluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, incubated for 3 min at 90 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described below. The dried gels were exposed to Kodak X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of the labeled protein bands was performed by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram, using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Scanning Densitometer. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with either Coomassie Blue or silver, or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and subjected to Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-VDAC antibody (clone number 173/045, Calbiochem-Novobiochem, Nottingham, UK) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. The colored reaction product was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. V8 Digestion and CNBr Cleavage of VDAC—For S. aureus (V8) digestion, purified [α-32P]BzATP-labeled VDAC was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) followed by Coomassie staining. VDAC bands were excised from the gel and rinsed in a solution of 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, and 1 mm EDTA for 30 min. Proteolysis was carried out as described previously (28Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, squashed slices of the excised protein band were applied to the bottom of the well in the stacking portion of a second SDS-PAGE gel (7-20% acrylamide). V8, prepared in the same buffer containing 20% glycerol, was then introduced into each buffer-filled well. Electrophoresis was performed until the bromphenol dye front approached the bottom of the stacking gel. The current was then turned off for 30 min, following which it was resumed for several hours. The gel was subjected to Coomassie staining and autoradiography or was electroblotted and subjected to immunostaining. For CNBr cleavage, [α-32P]BzATP-labeled VDAC was dissolved in 0.4 ml of 80% (v/v) formic acid containing CNBr (8 or 32 mg/ml). The tube was sealed under nitrogen and incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature, after which 1 ml of water was added, and the sample was lyophilized twice, dissolved in sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide), autoradiography, silver staining, or immunoblotting. Sequence Analysis of VDAC Fragments—Briefly, purified VDAC was subjected to V8 digestion as described above and the obtained fragment bands of about 17 and 14 kDa were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel proteolysis with Lys-C. The resulting peptides were resolved by reverse-phase chromatography and electrosprayed into an ion-trap mass spectrometer and identified by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCQ, Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Ten of the resultant peptides were identified in rat, mouse, and human VDAC1 sequences. Selected peptides were then sequenced by an automated sequencer (The Protein Center, Technion, Israel). Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Analysis—Purified VDAC (25 μl, at 1 mg/ml) was UV irradiated in the presence or absence of 80 μm BzATP (see above), dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, for 6 h at room temperature, and dried using SpeedVac. The samples were re-dissolved in an aqueous solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, diluted 1:1 with matrix solution (a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in isopropyl alcohol:formic acid:H2O (2:1:3, v/v)), and 1 μl of the mixture was spotted on the MALDI target plate and air dried. The obtained results were analyzed as described below. To localize the VDAC NBS, unlabeled and BzATP-labeled VDAC (∼25 μg) were precipitated with acetone (at -70 °C) so that the detergent would not disrupt the MALDI analysis. The pellets were re-solubilized in 50 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, containing 1 m urea, and incubated for 8 h at 37 °C. The samples were then diluted 1:3 with the same buffer without urea and subjected to digestion with trypsin (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated, type XIII from bovine pancreas, Sigma), at a 1:20 ratio of enzyme:protein (w/w). Digestion was carried out for 24 h at 37 °C, and then aliquots (∼0.6 μg of protein) were dried by SpeedVac and prepared for the MALDI analysis as described previously (29Landry F. Lombardo C.R. Smith J.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF analysis was performed at the National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev (BGU), Beer-Sheva, Israel. Mass spectra of VDAC and VDAC fragments, bound or not bound to BzATP, were acquired using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer Reflex IV (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser, with delayed extraction. The acceleration voltage was 20.0 kV. All spectra were obtained in positive-ion mode. For each sample, 300-500 laser shots were accumulated in a linear mode and processed by XMASS 5.1.5 software (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). Demonstration and Characterization of Nucleotide-binding Site(s) in VDAC—VDAC, purified from rat liver mitochondria by chromatography on HA:celite, was found to bind to RRA, previously shown to bind nucleotide-binding proteins (30Coll R.J. Murphy A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14249-14254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, RRA-bound VDAC was eluted with ATP (Fig. 1) and ADP (not shown), whereas AMP was less effective (Fig. 1) and NADH was ineffective in releasing VDAC from the RRA (not shown). These results thus suggest the presence of nucleotide-binding site(s) in VDAC. To identify and characterize the NBSs in the VDAC molecule, the photoreactive ATP analog, [α-32P]BzATP, was used. A representative autoradiogram of purified VDAC labeled with increasing [α-32P]BzATP concentrations is shown in Fig. 2C. Quantitative analysis of VDAC labeling with relatively high [α-32P]BzATP concentrations showed saturation with half-maximal binding (K0.5) at about 70 μm (Fig. 2B). Scatchard plot analysis of the data revealed a non-linear correlation representing high and low affinity binding sites, with apparent Kd values of 15 and 53 μm, respectively (Fig. 2A, inset), suggesting binding of [α-32P]BzATP to two or more classes of NBSs in the VDAC molecule. Further analysis of the high affinity binding site revealed saturation and an apparent binding affinity of 4.98 ± 0.74 μm (n = 10) (Fig. 2B), whereas the apparent binding affinity of the low affinity site(s) (Fig. 2A) ranged between 55 and 110 μm (n = 5). To demonstrate the presence of NBS in membrane-embedded VDAC, representing VDAC in its native state, mitochondria were UV irradiated in the presence of [α-32P]BzATP. Several proteins were labeled, among them VDAC, as identified by immunostaining using a specific antibody (Fig. 2D, panel I). To further confirm membrane-embedded VDAC labeling, VDAC was purified from [α-32P]BzATP-prelabeled mitochondria. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 2D, panel II, purified VDAC was labeled with [α-32P]BzATP. The binding specificity of the VDAC NBS was analyzed by VDAC labeling with [α-32P]BzATP in the presence of various nucleotides. Quantitative analysis of autoradiograms obtained from different experiments (representative results are shown in Fig. 3A) revealed that the labeling was decreased by the nucleotides in the following order of effectiveness: GTP = GDP ≥ ATP = ADP > AMP-PNP > UDP > AMP > UTP, whereas CDP and CTP were much less effective (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the effect of NADH on VDAC labeling varied among different VDAC preparations, where in three of six experiments, NADH showed an inhibitory effect, lower by ∼15% than that of ATP, whereas in the other three experiments, NADH had no effect (data not shown). To conclude, the labeling results indicate that the VDAC NBSs recognize(s) purine nucleotides (i.e. AMP, ADP, ATP, GDP, GTP, and AMP-PNP) better than pyrimidine nucleotides (CDP, CTP, UDP, and UTP) (p < 0.0001, Student’s t test for the indicated purine group versus the pyrimidine group). The effect of various divalent cations (Me2+) and EDTA on [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC was considered next. As presented in Table 1, all divalent cations tested inhibited VDAC labeling. In contrast, EDTA increased [α-32P]BzATP binding. Characterization of the effects of Mn2+ and Mg2+ on [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC showed that both cations inhibited [α-32P]BzATP labeling with IC50 values of 10 ± 2 and 92 ± 14 μm, respectively (Fig. 4A). Analysis of [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC as a function of the relative amount of free nucleotide, or of the nucleotide·Mg complex (Fig. 4B), clearly indicated that binding increased with increasing concentrations of the free nucleotide, and decreased with increased Mg·[α-32P]BzATP concentration. Furthermore, when all of the [α-32P]BzATP was complexed with Mg2+, the extent of VDAC labeling was only 20% of that obtained when the same concentration of free [α-32P]BzATP was employed. Thus, VDAC seems to have about a 5-fold lower affinity for the Mg·[α-32P]BzATP complex than for [α-32P]BzATP. This suggests that the negatively charged nucleotide, rather than the Me2+·[α-32P]BzATP complex, is the species bound by VDAC. High concentrations of NaCl, LiCl, and KCl (10-100 mm) also inhibited [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC (data not shown). Because, at solutions with similar ionic strength, NaCl displayed a 13-fold lower inhibition of [α-32P]BzATP labeling than MgCl2 (data not shown), it is most likely that the labeling inhibition is not because of non-specific effects of ionic strength. Furthermore, the effect of the monovalent cations on [α-32P]BzATP labeling was not because of the formation of Me1+·[α-32P]BzATP complexes (as calculated from the association constant), because only a small percentage of BzATP forms such complexes, but rather was the result of direct interaction with VDAC. To conclude, the inhibitory effect of divalent cations on [α-32P]BzATP labeling appears to result from the reduction of the concentration of the VDAC bound species, i.e. free [α-32P]BzATP.TABLE 1Divalent cations inhibit VDAC labeling by [α-32P]BzATP Purified VDAC was UV irradiated in the presence of 1 μm [α-32P]BzATP and in the absence or presence of the indicated compounds. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of the autoradiograms was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results represent the mean ± S.E. of three to five different experiments carried out with different VDAC preparations.AdditionConcentration[α-32P]BzATP labelingmm% of controlNone100EDTA1.0188.7 ± 31.5MnCl20.0148.7 ± 9.6MnCl20.118.1 ± 1.7MgCl20.528.9 ± 8.1CaCl20.542.0 ± 4.3SrCl20.559.0 ± 9.9 Open table in a new tab FITC Modification of the VDAC NBS—Having shown that VDAC possesses NBSs, we further tested whether lysine residues present in or proximal to Walker-type nucleotide-binding motifs (31Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4250) Google Scholar) are involved in [α-32P]BzATP binding to VDAC, using FITC, which covalently binds to the ∈-amino group of lysine (Fig. 5). FITC strongly inhibited [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at about 18 μm and maximal inhibition (85%) at about 80 μm FITC (Fig. 5A). The linear relationship between FITC labeling of VDAC, as assayed by the fluorescence intensity of FITC-VDAC, and FITC inhibition of [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC (Fig. 5B) could reflect modification of a lysine residue(s) located in the ATP-binding site(s), or in a distinct site that indirectly affects nucleotide binding to VDAC. The relation between the site of FITC modification and the site of ATP binding was further demonstrated by the protection afforded by ATP and ADP against FITC inhibition of [α-32P]BzATP binding to VDAC (data not shown). Localization of the VDAC NBS—To localize the NBS in VDAC, [α-32P]BzATP-labeled protein was subjected to chemical or enzymatic cleavage (Figs. 6 and 7), followed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotting, and autoradiography. As expected from the presence of a single methionine in rat VDAC, CNBr treatment of [α-32P]BzATP-labeled VDAC resulted in cleavage of the 31-kDa protein into two fragments of about 16.4 and 14.7 kDa, each labeled with [α-32P]BzATP (Fig. 6, A and B). The decrease in the intensity of [α-32P]BzATP labeling of VDAC observed after a 24-h incubation with formic acid (Fig. 6B, second lane) probably resulted from partial hydrolysis of the covalent bond between the protein and [α-32P]BzATP that occurred during low pH treatment. Finally, use of an antibody raised against the VDAC N-terminal led to immunostaining of the uncleaved VDAC and the 16.4-kDa VDAC fragment, but not the 14.7-kDa fragment (Fig. 6C). Thus, the fragments seem to correspond to the N and C termini of VDAC, respectively. These results support the existence of at least two NBSs, at least one located in each of the N- and C-terminal halves of VDAC.FIGURE 7V8 proteolysis of [α-32P]BzATP-labeled VDAC yields two radiolabeled fragments. VDAC was labeled with 2μm [α-32P]BzATP and subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), followed by Coomassie blue staining. VDAC bands were excised from the gel and subjected to V8 digestion in a second gel (see “Experimental Procedures”), followed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (CBB) (A) and autoradiography (B), or electroblotting and immunoblot using an anti-VDAC antibody (C).

https://openalex.org/W2015366670,"Abstract PriA helicase plays crucial roles in restoration of arrested replication forks. It carries a “3′ terminus binding pocket” in its N-terminal DNA binding domain, which is required for high affinity binding of PriA to a fork carrying a 3′-end of a nascent leading strand at the branch. We show that the abrogation of the 3′ terminus recognition either by a mutation in the 3′ terminus binding pocket or by the bulky modification of the 3′-end leads to unwinding of the unreplicated duplex arm on this fork, causing potential fork destabilization. This indicates a critical role of the 3′ terminus binding pocket of PriA in its “stable” binding at the fork for primosome assembly. In contrast, PriA unwinds the unreplicated duplex region on a fork without a 3′-end, potentially destabilizing the fork. However, this process is inhibited by RecG helicase, capable of regressing the fork until the 3′-end of the nascent leading strand reaches the branch. PriA now stably binds to this regressed fork, stabilizing it. Using a model arrest-fork-substrate, we reconstitute the above process in vitro with RecG and PriA proteins. Our results present a novel mechanism by which two helicases function in a highly coordinated manner to generate a structure in which an arrested fork is stabilized for further repair and/or replication restart."
https://openalex.org/W2080691203,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we identified ezrin as a protein interacting with the C-tail of the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR). The interaction was shown to occur in vitro between the receptor C-tail and the N-terminal portion of ezrin, or Four-point-one ERM (FERM) domain. The α1b-AR/ezrin interaction occurred inside the cells as shown by the finding that the transfected α1b-AR and FERM domain or ezrin could be coimmunoprecipitated from human embryonic kidney 293 cell extracts. Mutational analysis of the α1b-AR revealed that the binding site for ezrin involves a stretch of at least four arginines on the receptor C-tail. The results from both receptor biotinylation and immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the FERM domain impaired α1b-AR recycling to the plasma membrane without affecting receptor internalization. The dominant negative effect of the FERM domain, which relies on its ability to mask the ezrin binding site for actin, was mimicked by treatment of cells with cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent. A receptor mutant (ΔR8) lacking its binding site in the C-tail for ezrin displayed delayed receptor recycling. These findings identify ezrin as a new protein directly interacting with a G protein-coupled receptor and demonstrate the direct implication of ezrin in GPCR trafficking via an actin-dependent mechanism.

Beyond G protein-coupled receptor kinases, β-arrestins, and heterotrimeric G protein subunits, a number of proteins have been found to interact with GPCRs using the yeast 2-hybrid system and other biochemical methods (for review, see Ref. 1.Hall R.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 2.Lefkowitz R.J. Shenoy S.K. Science. 2005; 308: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 3.Bockaert J. Fagni L. Dumuis A. Marin P. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 103: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The functional implications of these interactions are not fully understood; however, they add an increasing complexity to the signaling mechanisms mediated by GPCRs and their regulation. We have previously reported that the α1b-adrenergic receptor (AR) undergoes rapid desensitization and endocytosis upon exposure to the agonist (4.Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the agonist-dependent receptor regulation involves both G protein-coupled receptor kinases and β-arrestins (5.Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants involved in agonist-induced regulation of the α1b-AR reside within the C-tail of the receptor, as demonstrated by the fact that truncation of this region almost completely abolished receptor desensitization and internalization (4.Lattion A.L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1b-AR can internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles, and this phenomenon depends at least in part on the direct binding to the receptor C-tail of the μ2 subunit of the AP2 clathrin-adaptor complex (6.Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Abuin L. Staub O. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19331-19340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To identify new proteins that interact with the α1b-AR which could be involved in regulating receptor function, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system and identified ezrin, a member of the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family of proteins. ERM proteins were originally characterized as structural components of the cell cortex but were soon shown also to participate in signaling pathways (for review, see Ref. 7.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). ERM proteins share a conserved structure including two main domains: the N-terminal portion, or Four-point-one-ERM (FERM) domain, which binds to protein targets at the plasma membrane, and the C-terminal portion, containing the binding site for F-actin. In the closed, or inactive, conformation, the C terminus of ERM proteins tightly binds to the FERM domain, thus preventing both interaction with membrane targets and actin. Upon activation of ERM proteins by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding and phosphorylation, this intramolecular interaction is released, and the FERM domain is free to bind to its protein targets, whereas the C terminus binds to actin filaments (8.Gary R. Bretscher A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1061-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). An indirect link between ERM proteins and GPCRs has been suggested by previous findings showing that some GPCRs can interact with the ERM adaptor EBP50 (also known as NHERF1) (9.Weinman E.J. Hall R.A. Friedman P.A. Liu-Chen L.-Y. Shenolikar S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 68: 1.1.-1.15Google Scholar, 10.Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M.

This interaction seems to play a role in GPCR trafficking, but the involvement of ezrin has not been directly demonstrated. In this study we demonstrate that ezrin can directly interact with the α1b-AR through a polyarginine motif located on the C-tail of the receptor and that this interaction contributes to receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. This is to our knowledge the first report demonstrating a direct interaction of an ERM protein with a GPCR and might provide some generalities about the link between GPCRs and events associated with cytoskeletal reorganization including receptor trafficking. Full-length human ezrin was PCR-amplified from an EST clone and subcloned in pCMV-Script, pCMV-FLAG, pEGFP-N3, pET30a, and pAct2 expression vectors. The FERM domain (FERM*) of ezrin, including amino acids (aa) 1-308 and its fragments F1 (aa 1-95), F2 (aa 89-202), F3 (aa 200-308), F1/2 (aa 1-202), and F2/3 (aa 89-308) were PCR-amplified and subcloned in pEGFP-N3. The cDNA coding for FERM* was subcloned in pET30a and pAct2 vectors. A cDNA encoding the C-terminal portion of ezrin (amino acids 285-586) was PCR-engineered and subcloned in pET30a, pAct2, and pEGFP-N3 expression vectors. The cDNA encoding for the hamster α1b-AR was PCR-amplified to introduce in-frame the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) at its C terminus and subcloned into pRK5. A cDNA fragment encoding the receptor C-tail (351-515) or its fragments (amino acids 351-380, 351-395, 351-425, 351-449, and 351-477) was PCR-amplified and subcloned in pGEX-4T1 and pLexA plasmids to obtain fusion proteins with GST and LexA at the N terminus of the fragments. The deletion of 2, 4, 6, 7, or 8 consecutive arginines at positions 371-378 in the receptor C-tail was achieved by PCR, and the mutated cDNA fragments were subcloned in pGEX-4T1 or pLexA vectors. The construct pEGFP-N1-μ2 was described previously (6.Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Abuin L. Staub O. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19331-19340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The yeast strain L40 was transformed with the C-tail-pLexA plasmid encoding the α1b-AR C-tail fused to LexA, and clones were selected and subsequently transformed with 250 μg of a human brain Matchmaker cDNA library in the pAct2 vector (Clontech). Of 13 million double transformants, 40 exhibited moderate to strong growth on histidine-deficient plates. The plasmids isolated from the positive clones were used to co-transform the L40 strain with either the C-tail-pLexA or the empty pLexA plasmid, and the specificity of the interaction was confirmed by growth on histidine-deficient plates as well as by β-galactosidase activity measures (Yeast Protocols Handbook; Clontech). HEK-293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) and transfected at 40-60% confluence in 100-mm dishes using the calcium phosphate method. After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h before harvesting. The total amount of transfected DNA was 10 μg/100-mm dish. GST-tagged fusion proteins of α1b-AR C-tail fragments were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pGEX4T1 in the BL21DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described before (6.Diviani D. Lattion A.L. Abuin L. Staub O. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19331-19340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli lysates were prepared by centrifugation of the bacterial culture followed by sonication in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifugation at 38,000 × g. After overnight incubation of the supernatants with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C, the resin was washed, resuspended in 1/100× culture volume of the same buffer, and stored at 4 °C. His6-tagged fusion of the full-length ezrin, its N-terminal, or C-terminal domains was expressed using the bacterial expression vector pET30a in the BL21DE3 strain and purified. Lysates of bacterial cultures expressing His6-tagged proteins were prepared by centrifugation and sonication of the bacterial pellet in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). The lysates were centrifuged at 38,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4°C. The resin was then washed 5 times and stored at 4 °C. His6-tagged fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole) for 1 h at room temperature, dialyzed, and stored at -20 °C after the addition of 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels. For GST pull-down experiments, HEK-293 cells expressing the various constructs grown on 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% digitonin (Sigma), 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 2 h of solubilization at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min, the protein content in the supernatants was measured using the Bradford reagent (Sigma). Glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to the different GST fusion proteins were incubated with 1.5 mg of proteins from cell lysates in a total volume of 1 ml (buffer B) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% digitonin) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The amount of cell extract loaded on the gel was 5% that used for the immunoprecipitation. For in vitro pull-down experiments, glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to the different GST-fused fragments of the α1b-AR C-tail were incubated with different quantities of purified His6-tagged N-terminal or C-terminal ezrin domains in a total volume of 1 ml of buffer D (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK-293 cells expressing the various constructs were grown in 100-mm dishes and harvested 48 h post-transfection. Cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free DMEM, treated for various times with 10-4 m epinephrine (Sigma), and then washed twice with PBS. For cross-linking experiments, 3.5 ml of Hepes buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm DSP (3,3′-dithiobis(propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) were added to each plate. Cross linking was allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature with gentle rocking. Cells were then washed twice with ice-cold DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, then twice with PBS and lysed in 1 ml of buffer B for 2 h at 4°C. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min, and the protein content in the supernatants was measured using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of total protein were then added to 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 1 ml (buffer C). The beads were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer C, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The amount of extract loaded on the gel was 5% that used for the immunoprecipitation. Samples were denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (65 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue) for 1 h at 37 °C or 5 minat95 °C, separated on 10% acrylamide gels, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The samples from pull-down experiments (see Figs. 1 and 3) were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading on the gel. In contrast, because the α1b-AR aggregates if heated at 95 °C, the samples from co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the α1b-AR were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. (see Figs. 2, 4, 5A, and 7). After heating at 95 °C, the FERM fusion proteins appeared as single bands, whereas in most of the samples incubated at 37 °C they migrated as multiple bands, probably because of incomplete denaturation of the fusion proteins. The blots were incubated for 1 h in TBS-Tween (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and then incubated with the specific primary antibody diluted in TBS-Tween for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-Tween for 1 h, washed 3 times with TBS-Tween, and developed using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The following primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (1:2,000; Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-HA (1:10,000; Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (1:1,000; Roche Applied Science); mouse monoclonal anti-ezrin (1:4,000; Sigma); mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (1:2,000; Roche Applied Science).FIGURE 3Mapping of the binding site for ezrin on the α1b-AR C-tail.

To measure receptor recycling to the cell surface, after incubation with 10-4 m epinephrine for 60 min the medium was removed, the cells were washed, fresh medium containing 10-7 m prazosin was added, and cells were incubated again at 37 °C for various times. Cells were then placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating the cells with 300 μg/ml membrane-impermeable biotin analog sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (EZ-link biotin, Pierce) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Unreacted biotin was quenched and removed by 3 washes with ice-cold TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl). Cells were then lysed in buffer C for 3 h at 4 °C,andthe cellular homogenate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were incubated overnight with 30 μl of streptavidin-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), pelleted by brief centrifugation, and washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer D. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with 40 μl of 100 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C; the samples were briefly centrifuged, and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the supernatants. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Biotinylated HA-tagged α1b-AR was detected using the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) as described above. Protocol B, Adapted from Cao et al. (12.Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)—To measure internalized biotinylated receptors, HEK-293 cells were transfected as in protocol A. After transfection, cells were incubated for 1 h in serum-free DMEM containing 10 μm cycloheximide, then washed twice with cold PBS and biotinylated using 4 ml of PBS containing 300 μg/ml sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, for 30 min at 4 °C. The dishes were washed three times with cold TBS to quench unreacted biotin, and fresh medium was added. After biotinylation, cells were treated as in protocol A to induce receptor internalization and recycling. When appropriate, 1 μm cytochalasin D (Sigma) was added 10 min before epinephrine, and cytochalasin D was kept throughout the experiment. After incubations, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, and biotin molecules covalently bound to cell surface proteins were cleaved off by incubation with 5 ml of stripping solution (50 mm glutathione, 300 mm NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 1% fetal calf serum) for 30 min at 4 °C. The remaining glutathione was then quenched using 5 ml of quenching solution (50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% bovine serum albumin) for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed in buffer C for 3 h at 4 °C. The intensity of each band was quantified by densitometry of films exposed in the linear range and analyzed using NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health). The statistical significance of the data was assessed using Student's t test. HEK-293 cells were grown on glass coverslips. DNA transfections and measurements of receptor internalization and recycling were done as described for the biotinylation experiments. After the treatment cells were fixed in PBS containing 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized for 5 min with PBS plus 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100. After incubation in PBS plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, the primary antibody in PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin was added for 1 h. Texas Red-phalloidin (2 μl/coverslip) was added together with the primary antibody. The coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with the Texas Red- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:100 in PBS plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. After three washes in PBS and one wash in H2O, coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Prolong (Molecular Probes). The fluorescent staining was visualized on laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta). Identification of Ezrin as a Protein Directly Interacting with the α1b-AR—Using the C-tail of the α1b-AR (α1b-Ct) (including amino acids 351-515 as shown in Fig. 3) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library, we identified one positive clone encoding amino acids 18-364 of human ezrin (also known as villin-2 (7.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The L40 yeast strain was transformed with the bait plasmid expressing the α1b-Ct in combination with empty pAct2 vector or with pAct2 encoding either the N-terminal (amino acids 1-308), the C-terminal half (amino acids 285-586) of ezrin, or the full-length ezrin. Yeast transformed with α1b-Ct and the N-terminal half of ezrin were able to grow in the absence of histidine and to produce β-galactosidase, whereas those transformed with the receptor C-tail and either the C-terminal portion or full-length ezrin did not (results not shown). Pull-down experiments were performed by incubating the GST-fused α1b-Ct immobilized on Sepharose beads with lysates of cells expressing either GFP alone or ezrin, its N-terminal or C-terminal half fused to GFP (Fig. 1A). The results of these experiments indicated that the ezrin N-terminal half, but neither its C-terminal portion nor the full-length ezrin, specifically bound the α1b-Ct. Within the ERM family of proteins, their N-terminal portion is generally indicated as the FERM domain (FERM*), which is involved in the interaction with membrane-bound proteins and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (7.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 586-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). To check whether the ezrin/α1b-AR interaction was direct, i.e. not mediated by another protein, we incubated GST-fused α1b-Ct immobilized on Sepharose beads with increasing amounts of the His-tagged FERM* or C-terminal portion of ezrin purified from bacteria. In addition to the His tag, the fragments carried the S tag, which could be detected using S protein-horseradish peroxidase. As shown in Fig. 1B, the FERM* was able to directly bind the α1b-Ct with an estimated affinity of ≈200 nm. In contrast, the C-terminal portion of ezrin did not bind even at concentrations as high as 1 μm (data not shown). The α1b-AR Interacts with Ezrin in Intact Cells—To demonstrate that the α1b-AR and ezrin can form a complex inside the cells, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments from HEK-293 cells transiently co-expressing the HA-tagged α1b-AR with ezrin, its FERM* or C-terminal portion fused to GFP. After immunoprecipitating the receptor using anti-HA antibodies, anti-GFP antibodies were used to immunoblot the immunoprecipitated samples. As shown in Fig. 2, the fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels in the cell extracts and ran as a doublet on SDS-PAGE, as has been often observed. Whereas the FERM* co-immunoprecipitated with the receptor, the C-terminal portion of ezrin did not (Fig. 2). A small amount of full-length ezrin-GFP could also co-immunoprecipitate with the receptor, thus suggesting that the α1b-AR and ezrin can associate inside the cells and that this interaction is mediated by the FERM domain. To assess whether the α1b-AR/ezrin interaction was regulated by receptor agonists, we overexpressed both the α1b-AR and wild type ezrin and co-immunoprecipitated them in the presence or absence of 1 mm DSP (3,3′-dithio-bis(propionic acid"

Mutations in either ABCG5 or ABCG8 cause sitosterolemia, a recessive disorder characterized by impaired biliary and intestinal sterol secretion, sterol accumulation, and premature atherosclerosis. The mechanism by which the G5G8 heterodimer couples ATP hydrolysis to sterol transport is not known. Here we examined the roles of the Walker A, Walker B, and signature motifs in the nucleotide-binding domains (NBD) of G5 and G8 using recombinant adenoviruses to reconstitute biliary sterol transport in G5G8-deficient mice. Mutant forms of each half-transporter were co-expressed with their wild-type partners. Mutations at crucial residues in the Walker A and Walker B domains of G5 prevented biliary sterol secretion, whereas mutations of the corresponding residues in G8 did not. The opposite result was obtained when mutations were introduced into the signature motif; mutations in the signature domain of G8 prevented sterol transport, but substitution of the corresponding residues in G5 did not. Taken together, these findings indicate that the NBDs of G5 and G8 are not functionally equivalent. The integrity of the canonical NBD formed by the Walker A and Walker B motifs of G5 and the signature motif of G8 is essential for G5G8-mediated sterol transport.

Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Most ABC transporters share a common architecture that includes two NBDs arranged in series with two membrane-spanning domains. The G family of ABC transporters includes five half-transporters that each contain a single hydrophilic NBD at the NH2 terminus and a membrane-spanning domain consisting of six transmembrane α-helices at the COOH terminus. Some of the G family members, such as ABCG2, function as homodimers, whereas other family members, such as ABCG5 (G5) and ABCG8 (G8), function as heterodimers (2.Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D.

Three highly conserved sequence elements in the NBDs of ABC transporters: the Walker A motif, the Walker B motif, and a signature motif, play critical roles in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (10.Higgins C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystallographic structures of several bacterial ABC transporters have revealed that the two NBDs of each transporter are formed by association between the Walker A and B motifs of one subunit and the signature motif of the other (11.Chen J.

The glutamate immediately downstream of the Walker B motif is highly conserved and plays a critical role in transport function (16.Payen L.F. Gao M. Westlake C.J. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 396: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), we have developed a working model of the NBDs in the G5G8 heterodimer (Fig. 1).In some transporters, such as ABCB1 (MDR1 or P-glycoprotein), the binding of ATP to one NBD precedes the binding of a second nucleotide to the other NBD, and ATP hydrolysis at both sites is required for efficient substrate transport (20.Senior A.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1998; 643: 213-218PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Urbatsch I.L. Beaudet L. Carrier I. Gros P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4592-4602Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In other transporters, such as ABCC7 (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), ATP hydrolysis at only one NBD is required to energize transport (22.Berger A.L. Ikuma M. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The precise roles of the two NBDs in G5 and G8 are not known. Development of an in vitro system to characterize the ATPase activity and sterol transport activity of G5 and G8 has proved to be challenging, and to date no such assay has been developed. Here we have expressed recombinant G5 and G8 in cultured cells and in genetically modified mice expressing no G5 and G8 to characterize the relative functional roles of the Walker A, Walker B, and signature motifs in each half-transporter. The results presented demonstrate that motifs in both NBDs are required for biliary sterol transport, but the actions of the two ATP-binding sites of G5 and G8 are not functionally equivalent.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Culture medium and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. 8-Azido-ATP, 8-azido[α-32P]ATP (14.3 Ci/mmol), and 8-azido[α-32P]ADP (15.4 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Affinity Labeling Technologies, Inc.

The presence of the desired mutation and the integrity of each construct were verified by DNA sequencing.Infection of CRL-1601 Cells with Recombinant Adenoviral Vectors—Recombinant adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs for wild-type and mutant G5 and G8 were generated by in vitro cre-lox recombination as described previously (2.Graf G.A. Li W.-P. Gerard R.D. Gelissen I. White A. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 659-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cultured rat hepatoma cells (CRL-1601) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (glucose, 1 g/liter) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. On day one, the cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/150-mm plate. After 24 h, the cells were infected with recombinant adenoviral vectors containing cDNAs for wild-type or mutant G5 and G8 (8 × 1010 particles/plate). After 60 h, the cells were harvested, and a plasma membrane-enriched fraction was isolated by centrifugation through sucrose, as described (23.Zhang D.W. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the membrane fractions were aliquotted and stored at -80 °C.Expression of Recombinant G5 and G8 in Mice Using Adenovirus—Mice homozygous for disrupted alleles at Abcg5 and Abcg8 (G5G8-/-) were generated as described (8.Yu L. Hammer R.E. Li-Hawkins J. Von Bergmann K. Lutjohann D. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16237-16242Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and maintained on a regular chow diet (Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI). Adenoviral particles (5 × 1012 particles/kg) were injected into the tail veins of the mice. After 72 h, the mice were fasted for 4 h, anesthetized with halothane, and killed by exsanguination. Bile was collected, and neutral sterol levels were measured using gas liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry as described (6.Graf G.A. Yu L. Li W.P. Gerard R. Tuma P.L. Cohen J.C. Hobbs H.H. J.

Liver tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis of G5 and G8—The membrane proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) by electroblotting. Immunoblotting was performed using an anti-G8 monoclonal antibody (1B10A5) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody (5161) directed against a recombinant peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–350 of G8 (6.Graf G.A.

Antibody binding was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or with donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Pierce). The membranes were then exposed to F-BX810™ Blue X-Ray films (Phoenix Research Products, Hayward, CA).Immunoprecipitation of G5 and G8—The membrane fractions of cells were solubilized in 400 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1× protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors; Roche Applied Science) for 2 h at 4°C. The cell lysates were precleared by adding 10 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-agarose (RepliGen Corp., Waltham, MA) and 10 μlof a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), and the samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The precleared lysates were incubated with an anti-G8 monoclonal antibody (20 μg) and 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein G-agarose overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the pellets were washed in lysis buffer three times for 10 min at 4 °C, and then the proteins were eluted using 1× SDS loading buffer (31 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1%SDS, 12.5% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The supernatants were transferred into new microcentrifuge tubes and incubated with 2 μl of anti-G5 polyclonal antibody (1:200), and 20 μl of a 50% (v/v) suspension of protein A-agarose for 6 h at 4°C. After extensive washing, the proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS loading buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The antibodies were stripped from the membrane by incubation for 40 min at 55 °C in stripping buffer (Pierce). Stripped membranes were confirmed to be free of signal by repeat autoradiography before incubating the filter with another antibody.Photolabeling of G5 and G8 with 8-Azido[α-32P]ATP and BeFx-induced Trapping of 8-Azido[α-32P]ADP by G5 and G8—ATP binding was examined by photolabeling with 8-azido[α-32P]ATP using membrane proteins isolated from CRL-1601 cells expressing recombinant G5, G8, or G5 plus G8 as described previously (24.Zhang D.W. Gu H.M. Situ D. Haimeur A. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46052-46063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions (10–40 μg) were incubated in 30 μl of labeling buffer (250 mm sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.02% NaN3) containing 10 μm 8-azido[α-32P]ATP on ice for 5 min and then subjected to UV irradiation for 3 min at 4 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 400 μl of ice-cold stop buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2), and the membranes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized in 400 μl of lysis buffer, and G5 and G8 were immunoprecipitated as described above. The samples were size-fractionated on 8% gels by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. The membranes were dried and exposed to F-BX810™ Blue X-ray films overnight at -80 °C.An identical protocol was used for the ATP competition experiment except that membrane fractions were incubated in labeling buffer containing 10 μm 8-azido[α-32P]ATP and various amounts of unlabeled ATP (0, 1, 10, 50 mm). To determine the binding affinity of G5 and G8 for 8-azido[α-32P]ATP, the experiment was performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP (ranging from 0.5 to 160 μm). The radioactivity incorporated into the G5 and G8 bands was quantified using a STORM 820 PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences) and the software ImageQuant 5.0. Apparent Kd values were obtained from the best fit of the data to a hyperbolic curve using Graphpad software and the equation Y = BmaxX/(Kd + X), where Bmax is the maximal binding, and Kd is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding.BeFx, AlFx, and Vi-induced trapping of 8-azido[α-32P]ADP was performed as described (25.Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 26.Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6847-6853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane proteins (10–40 μg) were incubated in labeling buffer (30 μl) containing 10 μm 8-azido[α-32P]ATP, and 1 mm (or 5 mm) Vi or 5 mm NaF plus either 100 μm BeCl2 or 100 μm AlCl3 at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were incubated on ice for 5 min in the presence of 30 mm cold ATP, followed by UV irradiation. The membranes were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed twice in 400 μl of ice-cold stop buffer and resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer, and G5 and G8 were separately immunoprecipitated as described. The proteins were size-fractionated on 8% gels by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. The membranes were then dried and exposed to F-BX810™ Blue X-Ray films overnight at -80 °C. The same membranes were also used for immunoblot analysis of G5 and G8.RESULTS8-Azido[α-32P]ATP Binding to G5 and G8 Does Not Require G5G8 Dimerization—To examine the binding of ATP to G5 and G8, we used recombinant adenoviruses to express the two proteins in cultured rat hepatoma cells (CRL-1601), either individually or together, and then immunoprecipitated the proteins from a solubilized membrane fraction. Only the lower molecular weight, precursor (P) forms of the proteins were seen when either G5 or G8 was expressed alone in cells (Fig. 2A). The mature (M), fully glycosylated forms of G5 and G8 were present only when G5 and G8 were co-expressed. These results are consistent with our prior findings that G5 and G8 must heterodimerize to exit the endoplasmic reticulum and transit through the Golgi complex to the cell surface (6.Graf G.A. Yu L.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48275-48282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Immunoblot analysis and 8-azido[α-32P]ATP binding to recombinant G5 and G8 in cultured rat hepatocytes (CRL-1601 cells). A, membrane proteins (30 μg) were isolated from CRL-1601 cells expressing wild-type G5, wild-type G8, G5 plus G8, or vector alone and incubated on ice with 8-azido[α-32P]ATP (10 μm) in labeling buffer for 5 min. The membranes were subjected to UV irradiation, and then G5 and G8 were immunoprecipitated using anti-G5 and anti-G8 specific antibodies (G5, left panel; G8, right panel). The immunoprecipitates were size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were exposed to autoradiography (bottom panels). Immunoblotting was performed on the same membrane using anti-G5 (top panels) and anti-G8 (middle panels) polyclonal antibodies. B, competition of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP binding by cold ATP. The binding of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP to G5 (top) and G8 (bottom) was measured as described for A except that the reaction was performed in the presence of unlabeled ATP (0, 1, 10, and 50 mm). C, binding of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP to G5 (top panel) and G8 (bottom panel) from membrane proteins (30 μg) was measured in the presence or absence of MgCl2 (5 mm). Molecular mass standards (in kDa) are provided. The experiment was repeated twice, and the results were similar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we examined whether heterodimerization and transport of G5 and G8 out of the endoplasmic reticulum is required for the proteins to bind an analog of ATP, 8-azido[α-32P]ATP. In cells expressing both G5 and G8, the precursor and mature forms of G5 and G8 photolabeled with 8-azido[α-32P]ATP. The degree of labeling was proportional to the amount of protein present (Fig. 2A). Azido-ATP also bound to G5 and G8 when they were expressed individually in cells. Thus, heterodimization of G5 and G8 was not required for ATP binding. Binding to both the precursor and mature forms of G5 and G8 was competed by the addition of excess cold nucleotide (Fig. 2B).Binding of 8-azido[α-32P]ATP required Mg2+ (Fig. 2C) and was inhibited by the addition of EDTA (data not shown) in cells expressing both half-transporters. Magnesium ions were also required to photolabel G5 with 8-azido[α32-P]ATP when the half-transporter was expressed individually in cells (Fig. 2C). In contrast to these findings, magnesium was not required for 8-azido[α-32P]ATP to bind to G8 when it was expressed in the absence of G5 (Fig. 2C).Next we examined the relative affinity of G5 and G8 for 8-azido[α-32P]ATP by measuring the amount of nucleotide bound to each half-transporter over a range of concentrations (Fig. 3). When G5 and G8 were expressed individually in cells, G5 bound ATP in a saturable manner with an apparent Kd of 66 μm, whereas ATP binding to G8 was not fully saturable up to a concentration of 160 μm (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of G5 and G8 did not affect the affinity of ATP binding to G5 (apparent Kd = 57 μm; Fig. 3B), whereas it increased the affinity of G8 for ATP. The binding of ATP to G8 became saturable with an apparent Kd of 174 μm. These data demonstrated that expressing G8 together with G5 resulted in a higher affinity, magnesium-dependent ATP binding to G8.FIGURE 3Binding affinity of G5 and G8 for 8-azido[α-32P]ATP. Cellular membranes containing either G5 or G8 (A) or both G5 and G8 (B) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 8-azido-[α32P]ATP and processed as described in the legend to Fig. 2A. The amount of radioactivity in the G5 and G8 bands was quantified using ImageQuaNT (29.Sauna Z.E. Nandigama K. Ambudkar S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48855-48864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2095467724,"MspA is the major porin of Mycobacterium smegmatis mediating the exchange of hydrophilic solutes across the outer membrane (OM). It is the prototype of a new family of octameric porins with a single central channel of 9.6 nm in length and consists of two hydrophobic β-barrels of 3.7 nm in length and a more hydrophilic, globular rim domain. The length of the hydrophobic domain of MspA does not match the thicknesses of mycobacterial OMs of 5-12 nm as derived from electron micrographs. Further, the membrane topology of MspA is unknown as it is for any other mycobacterial OM protein. We used MspA as a molecular ruler to define the boundaries of the OM of M. smegmatis by surface labeling of single cysteine mutants. Seventeen mutants covered the surface of the rim domain and were biotinylated with a membrane-impermeable reagent. The label efficiencies in vitro were remarkably similar to the predicted accessibilities of the cysteines. By contrast, six of these mutants were protected from biotinylation in M. smegmatis cells. Tryptophan 21 defines a horizontal plane that dissects the surface-exposed versus the membrane-protected residues of MspA. The 8 phenylalanines at position 99 form a ring at the periplasmic end of the hydrophobic β-barrel domain. These results indicated that (i) the membrane boundaries of MspA are defined by aromatic girdles as in porins of Gram-negative bacteria and (ii) loops and a 3.4-nmlong part of the hydrophilic rim domain are embedded into the OM of M. smegmatis. This is the first report suggesting that elements other than hydrophobic α-helices or β-sheets are integrated into a lipid membrane.

This is the first report suggesting that elements other than hydrophobic α-helices or β-sheets are integrated into a lipid membrane. Mycobacteria are surrounded by an inner membrane and a giant macromolecule consisting of peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and very long chain fatty acids, the mycolic acids (1Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Minnikin (2Minnikin D.E. The Biology of the Mycobacteria: Physiology, Identification and Classification.in: Ratledge C. Stanford J. Academic Press, London1982: 95-184Google Scholar) originally proposed that the mycolic acids, which are covalently bound to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan co-polymer, form the inner leaflet of an unique outer membrane (OM) 3The abbreviations used are: OM, outer membrane; octyl-POE, N-octylpolyoxyethylene; MPB, N-(3-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin; WT, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol. . Experimental evidence for this model was provided by x-ray diffraction studies, which showed that the mycolic acids are oriented in parallel and perpendicular to the plane of the cell envelope (3Nikaido H. Kim S.H. Rosenberg E.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The presence of an organized structure of extremely low fluidity in an isolated mycobacterial cell wall was confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (4Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The vast abundance of non-covalently bound lipids in mycobacteria is assumed to constitute the outer leaflet of a supported asymmetric lipid bilayer. The analysis of spin-labeled fatty acids inserted into isolated mycobacterial cell walls by electron paramagnetic resonance supported the existence of a moderately fluid outer leaflet, whereas the inner leaflet had an extremely low fluidity (4Liu J. Rosenberg E.Y. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11254-11258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 5Liu J. Barry III, C.E. Besra G.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol.

This interpretation is consistent with observations that mutants with defects in the production of some of the major extractable lipids (glycopeptidolipids, phthiocerol dimycocerosate) showed an increased OM permeability (6Camacho L.R.

Thus, the mycobacterial OM resembles a supported asymmetric lipid bilayer and provides an extraordinarily efficient permeability barrier, which is 100-1000-fold less permeable than that of Escherichia coli (8Jarlier V. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1418-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 9Jarlier V. Gutmann L. Nikaido H. Antimicrob.

Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The existence of an additional lipid bilayer requires a set of dedicated OM proteins. E. coli uses more than 60 proteins to functionalize its OM (11Molloy M.P. Herbert B.R. Slade M.B. Rabilloud T. Nouwens A.S. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), many of which are channel proteins to permeabilize the membrane for nutrient transport (12Nikaido H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2900) Google Scholar). The existence of pore-forming proteins in Mycobacterium chelonae was described 13 years ago (47Trias J. Jarlier V. Benz R. Science. 1992; 258: 1479-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), but substantial progress in terms of functional, biochemical, and structural properties of these porins has only been achieved for MspA, which was identified as a channel-forming protein in chloroform/methanol extracts of Mycobacterium smegmatis (30Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Deletion of mspA reduced the OM permeability of M. smegmatis toward cephaloridine and glucose 9- and 4-fold, respectively (13Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 57, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These results showed that MspA is the major general diffusion pathway for hydrophilic molecules in M. smegmatis. Electron micrographs of negatively stained cell wall fragments of M. smegmatis revealed MspA porins with a central channel of 10 nm in length and an tetra- or octameric symmetry (14Engelhardt H. Heinz C. Niederweis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37567-37572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The core of the MspA channel is an extremely stable β-sheet domain, which resisted dissociation and denaturation up to 92 °C in the presence of 2% SDS as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy (15Heinz C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8678-8685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a mycobacterial OM protein showed that eight monomers of MspA constitute a single channel of 9.6 nm in length (16Faller M. Niederweis M. Schulz G.E. Science. 2004; 303: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This architecture is completely different from that of the trimeric porins of Gram-negative bacteria, which have one pore per monomer and are ∼4 nm long (17Koebnik R. Locher K.P. van Gelder P. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 239-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). These results established MspA as the founding member of a new class of porins (18Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Superficially, the length of MspA seems to fit the extraordinary thicknesses of the mycobacterial OMs, which were estimated to 5-12 nm from ultrathin sections of mycobacterial cells by electron microscopy (19Paul T.R. Beveridge T.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6508-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 20Paul T.R. Beveridge T.J. Zentbl.

However, the hydrophobic part of MspA consists of two consecutive β-barrels of a combined length of only 3.7 nm (16Faller M. Niederweis M. Schulz G.E.

There are two alternative explanations; either the OM of M. smegmatis is not thicker than 3.7 nm, or the large and hydrophilic rim domain of MspA is at least partially embedded into the membrane. To solve this puzzle, we examined, in this study, the topology of MspA in the OM of M. smegmatis by cysteine scanning mutagenesis and compared the accessibility of 47 cysteine mutants in vitro and in vivo with the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent N-(3-maleimidopropionyl)biocytin (MPB). The results showed clear protection of cysteines in the hydrophilic rim domain in vivo, indicating that a larger part of MspA might be inserted into the OM of M. smegmatis than assumed from crystal structure. Chemicals and Enzymes—Chemicals were of the highest purity available from Merck, Roth, or Sigma. MPB was from Fluka. The detergent N-octylpolyoxyethylene (octyl-POE) was from Bachem. Oligonucleotides were obtained from MWG Biotech. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—M. smegmatis SMR5 (22Sander P. Prammananan T. Bottger E.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 841-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and M. smegmatis ML10, which lacks the porin genes mspA and mspC (23Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailander C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), were grown in 7H9 medium (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37 °C. E. coli DH5α was used for cloning experiments and was routinely grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) at 37 °C. Hygromycin was used in concentrations of 50 and 200 μg/ml for E. coli and M. smegmatis, respectively. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Cysteine mutants of MspA were constructed by site-specific mutagenesis using the combined chain reaction method (24Bi W. Stambrook P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 256: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the plasmid pMN016, which carries the psmyc-mspA transcriptional fusion (23Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailander C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) as template, and psmyc1 and pMS-seq1 as end primers and an appropriate mutagenesis primer (supplemental Table S1). All plasmids were verified by sequencing the entire mspA gene before they were transformed into the porin mutant M. smegmatis ML10. Analysis of the Total Protein of M. smegmatis—M. smegmatis containing the mspA expression plasmids or the empty vector pMS2 (25Kaps I. Ehrt S. Seeber S. Schnappinger D. Martin C. Riley L.W. Niederweis M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 278: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as a control was grown to an optical density (A600) of 0.8. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and were washed three times with PEN buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm NaCl). Then, the cells were suspended in 1 ml of PEN buffer to yield an optical density A600 of 8. 500 μl of the cell suspension were mixed with suspended glass beads (volume ratio 3:1). The cells were disrupted with a bead-beater (FastPrep FP120, Qbiogene Inc., intensity 6, 2 × 20 s). The suspension was adjusted to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v) octyl-POE, boiled for 15 min, cooled on ice, and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g. Protein concentrations in the supernatant were determined by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay according to the manufacturer’s instructions (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce). The supernatants were used directly or were stored at -20 °C. For analysis, the proteins were separated on denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Expression and Selective Extraction of Porins from M. smegmatis—The wild-type (WT) mspA gene (pMN016) and the mutated mspA genes (pMN016 derivatives) were constitutively expressed in the M. smegmatis porin mutant ML10. All MspA proteins were extracted from M. smegmatis using a method that is selective for Msp porins (26Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested and washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) Tween 80, pH 7), resuspended in POP05 buffer (300 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 0.3 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (w/v) N-octyl-POE) to yield a cell density of 100 μl/10 mg of cells (wet weight), and boiled under stirring for 30 min in a water bath. The suspension was cooled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g. In wild-type M. smegmatis, Msp porins constitute more than 80% of the total protein content in the supernatant (26Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated in a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel, which was stained with silver. Optimization of the Biotinylation Reaction—To optimize the biotinylation reaction, a 20-ml culture of M. smegmatis expressing the MspA cysteine mutant E139C was grown to an A600 of 0.8. The cells were harvested at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min and washed twice with PBS. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of PBS, and dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 4000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS. Samples of 200 μl were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C at final MPB concentrations of 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mm. The reaction was stopped by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. A concentration of 0.1 mm was sufficient to clearly detect the biotinylated MspA mutant in Western blot experiments. Then, the minimal reaction time was determined by carrying out the biotinylation in the presence of 0.1 mm MPB. At different times, 200-μl samples were taken from the mixture, and the reaction was stopped at the indicated times with DTT as described above. All samples were analyzed by Western blot experiments. Biotinylation of Denatured MspA Cysteine Mutants—To verify the presence of a cysteine in the MspA mutants, MspA in selective extracts of M. smegmatis was denatured by adding ethanol to a final concentration of 80% (v/v) and heating at 100 °C for 15 min. Ethanol was removed by vacuum, and the pellet was dissolved in POP05 buffer (same volume as the original extract volume). The sample was then incubated with DTT to reduce oxidized cysteines (see above). To remove the DTT, the protein was precipitated after adding an equal volume of acetone and incubation on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g, the pellet was dissolved in 10 μl of POP05. The labeling reaction was carried out by adding MPB to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and incubating for 15 s at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. Biotinylation of Native MspA Cysteine Mutants in Vitro and in Vivo—For biotinylation of the MspA cysteine mutants in vitro and in vivo cells were grown to an optical density A600 of 0.8, harvested by centrifugation, and washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS (100 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% (m/v) Tween 80, pH 7). To compare the label efficiencies for the MspA cysteine mutants in vivo and in vitro, a culture of M. smegmatis expressing a particular MspA mutant was split into two halves. The respective MspA mutant protein was extracted at 100 °C from one half of the culture. To reduce potentially oxidized cysteines, 10 μl of the extracts were incubated with DTT at a final concentration of 10 mm for 30 min at 25 °C. Removal of DTT by precipitation of the proteins with acetone and biotinylation with MPB was done as described in the previous paragraph. For in vivo biotinylation, the other half of the cells was incubated with DTT at a final concentration of 10 mm for 30 min at 25 °C. The cells were washed again with PBS, and 200 μl of the cell suspension were incubated at 25 °C in a final concentration of 0.1 mm MPB. The reaction was stopped after 15 s by adding DTT to a final concentration of 20 mm. After washing with PBS and resuspending in POP05 buffer (300 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 0.3 mm Na2EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (m/v) N-octyl-POE) to a cell density of 10 mg/100 μl, the suspension was boiled under stirring for 30 min in a water bath. The suspension was cooled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and the pellet containing the cell debris was discarded. The supernatant contained the MspA mutant protein. Both supernatants, obtained after biotinylation of the MspA mutant protein in vitro or within M. smegmatis cells, were further analyzed for protein content by gel electrophoresis and for the amount of biotin label by Western blot experiments. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blots—Protein samples were analyzed in denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver. All samples were mixed with loading buffer (140 mm Tris, 4% SDS, 30% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, pH 7.5) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature before loading on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel (27Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) if not stated otherwise. For detection of biotinylated MspA mutants, the protein gel was blotted overnight at 50 mA in the transfer buffer (10 mm NaHCO3,3 mm Na2CO3, 20% methanol) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The presence of the biotin label on the MspA cysteine mutants was detected by using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative Analysis of in Vitro and in Vivo Biotinylation of MspA Porin—Images of Western blots were analyzed using the LABWORKS software 4.6 from UVP Bioimaging systems. To compare the amount of MspA oligomer in the in vivo (C) and in vitro (P) lanes, the oligomeric band area was selected. The amount of protein in each band was calculated from the area under the peak. The difference in the amount of labeled oligomer in vivo and in vitro was expressed as percentage value. Accessibility of the Cysteines in the Crystal Structure of MspA—The theoretical accessibility of the cysteines in the MspA mutants was calculated using the crystal structure of MspA (Protein Data Bank accession code: 1UUN). To this end, the amino acids at the mutated positions were replaced by cysteines using program Swiss-PdbViewer 3.7 (Glaxo-SmithKline R&D). The rotamer of the cysteine with the lowest energy was chosen. The relative accessibility of the introduced cysteine residues in the MspA molecule toward solvent molecules was calculated using the accessibility function of the Swiss-PdbViewer software. The maximum accessibility is defined as the accessible surface area for residue X in an extended pentapeptide GGXGG and is set to 100%. The relative accessibility of a residue X in the MspA structure was calculated by comparison of the observed accessibility with this reference value. The numerical value for each cysteine residue was obtained by a selfwritten script and ranged from 0 to 47%. The mutant E139C was chosen as the positive control based on this analysis. Construction of MspA Cysteine Mutants—The versatility of single cysteine mutants appeared to be most attractive to investigate the membrane topology of the MspA porin. Since wild-type MspA does not contain any cysteine residues, 52 out of 184 amino acids of the mature protein were directly replaced by cysteines using site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 1). The positions for these mutations were selected before the crystal structure of MspA was published (16Faller M. Niederweis M. Schulz G.E. Science. 2004; 303: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) using the following criteria. (i) Putative extracellular loops were predicted by a neural network specialized for outer membrane proteins (28Diederichs K. Freigang J. Umhau S. Zeth K. Breed J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2413-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and by an algorithm specialized for prediction of membrane-spanning β-strands (29Rauch G. Moran O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 908-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Niederweis M. Ehrt S. Heinz C. Klöcker U. Karosi S. Swiderek K.M. Riley L.W. Benz R. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 933-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and were preferably targeted to gain topological information. (ii) Charged amino acids are often located in extracellular loops and may also play functional roles by determining the charge selectivity of MspA. Thus, 20 out of 28 charged amino acids were mutated. (iii) The four known Msp porins of M. smegmatis constitute a family of very closely related proteins, which differ altogether at 18 positions from a consensus sequence (13Stahl C. Kubetzko S. Kaps I. Seeber S. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40 (Correction (2005) Mol. Microbiol. 57, 1509): 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These positions might be functionally important and were mutated except for the conservative exchanges L8V, I68V, S103T, and V104I. (iv) The remaining positions were selected to cover the entire MspA sequence without gaps larger than eight amino acids. Expression of MspA Cysteine Mutants in M. smegmatis—The mutated mspA genes were expressed in the M. smegmatis strain ML10, which lacks the two porin genes mspA and mspC. This strain contains a 15-fold reduced number of Msp porins in the OM (23Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailander C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To examine whether the MspA cysteine mutants were expressed in the OM of M. smegmatis, a selective extraction procedure was employed that yields predominantly MspA when whole cells of M. smegmatis are heated with 0.5% octyl-POE to 100 °C (26Heinz C. Niederweis M. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 285: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amount of all 52 MspA cysteine mutants in these selective heat extracts were examined by gel electrophoresis. An example is shown in Fig. 2. It was shown earlier that expression of WT mspA in the ML10 strain using the vector pMN016 (psmyc-mspA transcriptional fusion) yields MspA levels as in WT M. smegmatis (23Stephan J. Bender J. Wolschendorf F. Hoffmann C. Roth E. Mailander C. Engelhardt H. Niederweis M. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 714-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No MspA or other Msp protein was observed in extracts of the ML10 strain with an empty vector as a control in Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels (Fig. 2, lane 3), indicating a very low background expression of other msp genes. A surprisingly high number of 36 mutants showed a significantly reduced or no detectable expression when compared with WT MspA (Fig. 2, lane 2). Examples are the mutants A96C and H148C shown in Fig. 2 (lanes 4 and 8). Only 16 out of 52 cysteine mutants were expressed on a similar level as WT MspA (not shown). Examples are five mutants shown in Fig. 2 (D134C, E139C, G141C, T150C, and A155C). The MspA octamer was observed in Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels for all cysteine mutants, albeit often as barely detectable bands, e.g. as for the D3C mutant (supplemental Fig. S1). However, 13 mutants were clearly less stable than the WT protein as evidenced by an increased amount of MspA monomer (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table 1). It should be noted that even for those destabilized mutants, the major part of the total protein was oligomeric after extraction for 30 min at 100 °C.TABLE 1Characterization of cysteine mutants of MspABiotinylationMutationLocation%AccessibilityDenaturedIn vitroStabilityWT−−G1CRm45+OD3CRim27+OE5CRim24+OD10CRim2+OD13CRim32+NDR14CRim5+MMT17CRim9+OW21CRim7+OD22CRim24+OG27CRim24−NDR33CRim35+MR38CRim6+−G44CRim1+MK47CRim2+OMI49CRim19+OME57CRim40+OG60CRim4+−E63CRim4+−G69CRim0+−S73CStem19+−L74CStem11+MV76CStem18+−T84CStem10+MMI87CStem8+MD91CPeriplasm12+OMD93CPeriplasm12+MMA96CPeriplasm28+MMG100CPeriplasm0+MMN102CPeriplasm22+MMP107CStem12+MMG112CStem9+MMV113CStem22+MMS114CStem17+MD118CStem30+−N121CStem15+ME127CRim30+−F131CRim13+MD134CRim47+OS136CRim30+OA138CRim12+OE139CRim38+OG141CRim10+OV144CRim3+−H148CRim22+MT150CRim21−−A155CRim12+MR161CRim0+MR165CRim3+−S173CRim9+MT175CRim1+ME179CRim44+ON184CRim40+O Open table in a new tab Detection of Cysteines by Biotinylation of Denatured MspA Mutant Proteins—To verify the presence of a cysteine, all MspA mutant proteins in selective extracts of M. smegmatis were denatured by heating to 100 °C in the presence of 80% ethanol. Reaction with the thiol-specific MPB and detection of the biotinylated MspA proteins in Western blot experiments using streptavidin demonstrated that all but two MspA cysteine mutants (G27C, T150C) were indeed expressed in M. smegmatis, albeit some at levels undetectable in protein gels by Coomassie Blue and silver staining (not shown). It is not clear why the G27C and T150C mutants were not biotinylated after denaturation because both proteins were clearly detectable in detergent extracts (supplemental Fig. S1). Wild-type MspA protein was not biotinylated because it does not contain a cysteine and was used as a negative control in those experiments. No or very faint bands of biotinylated proteins other than the respective MspA cysteine mutants were observed in these experiments, indicating that cysteine-containing proteins were almost completely absent in the MspA-selective detergent extracts of M. smegmatis. Optimization of the Biotinylation Conditions—It was crucial to ensure that the biotinylation reaction was rate-limited to quantify the accessibility of the cysteines in the MspA mutants. The E139C mutant was chosen for these experiments because this residue is surface-exposed as demonstrated using a whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiment (16Faller M. Niederweis M. Schulz G.E. Science. 2004; 303: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The rationale was that the rate-limiting conditions for this residue should also be rate-limiting for other, less accessible cysteines. To this end, the amount of the label reagent MPB and the reaction time should be reduced as much as possible. The MspA mutant E139C was incubated with MPB in vitro at final concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 10 mm for 30 min. Biotinylated MspA was clearly detected in samples containing 50 μm and higher concentrations of MPB in Western blot experiments (supplemental Fig. S2A). A kinetic experiment using 100 μm MPB revealed that incubation for 15 s was sufficient to detect biotinylation of the cysteine at position 139 (supplemental Fig. S2B). Thus, in all following experiments, the MspA cysteine mutants were labeled in vitro or in whole cells of M. smegmatis with 100 μm MPB for 15 s at 25 °C unless otherwise noted. Biotinylation Efficiencies Reflect Altered Accessibilities to MPB of Cysteines of Membrane-embedded MspA—To determine which cysteines are accessible to the membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent MPB in the native OM environment of MspA, the MspA mutants were expressed in M. smegmatis ML10 (ΔmspA ΔmspC). To ensure that equal amounts of MspA protein were present in both the in vitro and the in vivo biotinylation reactions, a culture of M. smegmatis expressing a particu"
https://openalex.org/W2037228365,"We have studied cofactor-induced conformational changes of the maltose ATP-binding cassette transporter by employing limited proteolysis in detergent solution. The transport complex consists of one copy each of the transmembrane subunits, MalF and MalG, and of two copies of the nucleotide-binding subunit, MalK. Transport activity further requires the periplasmic maltose-binding protein, MalE. Binding of ATP to the MalK subunits increased the susceptibility of two tryptic cleavage sites in the periplasmic loops P2 of MalF and P1 of MalG, respectively. Lys262 of MalF and Arg73 of MalG were identified as probable cleavage sites, resulting in two N-terminal peptide fragments of 29 and 8 kDa, respectively. Trapping the complex in the transition state by vanadate further stabilized the fragments. In contrast, the tryptic cleavage profile of MalK remained largely unchanged. ATP-induced conformational changes of MalF-P2 and MalG-P1 were supported by fluorescence spectroscopy of complex variants labeled with 2-(4′-maleimidoanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid. Limited proteolysis was subsequently used as a tool to study the consequences of mutations on the transport cycle. The results suggest that complex variants exhibiting a binding protein-independent phenotype (MalF500) or containing a mutation that affects the “catalytic carboxylate” (MalKE159Q) reside in a transition state-like conformation. A similar conclusion was drawn for a complex containing a replacement of MalKQ140 in the signature sequence by leucine, whereas substitution of lysine for Gln140 appears to lock the transport complex in the ground state. Together, our data provide the first evidence for conformational changes of the transmembrane subunits of an ATP-binding cassette import system upon binding of ATP.

They are integral to almost every biological process and physiological system. Most are involved in the uptake or export of an enormous variety of substances across cell membranes, from small ions to large polypeptides. Many of these proteins are of considerable medical importance. Mutations in several “ABC genes” lead to genetic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, Tangier disease, and adrenoleukodystrophy, or confer resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents (1.Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, New York2003Google Scholar). ABC transporters share a common architectural organization comprising two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (TMDs) that form the translocation pathway and two hydrophilic nucleotide-binding (ABC) domains (NBDs) that hydrolyze ATP. In prokaryotes, these domains are mostly expressed as separate protein subunits, whereas in eukaryotes, especially in mammalian cells, they are usually fused into a single polypeptide chain. The ABC domains are characterized by a set of Walker A and B motifs that are involved in nucleotide binding and by the unique LSGGQ signature sequence (2.Schneider E. Hunke S. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the crystal structures of several mostly prokaryotic ABC domains have been reported (reviewed in Refs. 3.Schmitt L. Tampé R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4.Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 5.Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). These structures largely agree on the overall fold. Accordingly, the cassette can be subdivided in an F1-type ATP-binding domain, encompassing both nucleotide-binding motifs, a specific α-helical subdomain, the LSGGQ motif, and a specific antiparallel β-subdomain. The configuration of the NBD dimer is less clear. However, the crystal structures of Rad50 (6.Hopfner K.-N. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Further progress in understanding the structural organization of ABC transporters was achieved with the high resolution structures of BtuCD, mediating the uptake of vitamin B12 in Escherichia coli (11.Locher K. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) and of MsbA, involved in the export of lipid A in Gram-negative bacteria (12.Chang G. Roth C.B.

Notwithstanding these advances, the conformational changes in the NBDs induced by ATP binding/hydrolysis (reviewed in Refs. 3.Schmitt L. Tampé R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4.Jones P.M. George A.M. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 682-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, and 15.Sharom F.J.

Academic Press, New York.2003: 107-133Crossref Google Scholar), and the means by which they are transmitted to the TMDs to effect substrate translocation remain largely to be elucidated. The maltose ABC transporter of E. coli/Salmonella typhimurium is one of the best characterized systems that can serve as a general model for ABC importers (5.Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 16.Schneider E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man. Academic Press, New York.2003: 157-185Crossref Google Scholar). The transporter is composed of the extracellular (periplasmic) receptor, the maltose-binding protein (MalE), and the membrane-bound complex comprising the hydrophobic subunits MalF and MalG and two copies of the ATPase (ABC) subunit, MalK (17.Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MalK and closely related ABC subunits belonging to the CUT1 and MOI subfamilies of ABC importers (18.Schneider E. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 19.Dassa E. Holland E.B. Cole S. Kuchler K. Higgins C.F. ABC Proteins: From Bacteria to Man.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2953-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) contain a unique C-terminal extension that, in the crystal structure of the MalK dimer, contributes substantially to monomer-monomer contacts (8.Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The observed conformational changes between ATP-free and ATP-bound MalKs confirm previous conclusions from protease susceptibility studies (21.Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and fluorescence spectroscopy (22.Mannering D.E. Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12362-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Association of the MalK subunits with MalF and MalG requires the so-called EAA sequence motifs that are conserved in the last cytoplasmic loop regions of TMDs of ABC import systems (23.Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 24.Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Transport of maltose is assumed to be initiated by interaction of substrate-loaded MalE with periplasmic loops of MalFG, thereby triggering conformational changes that result in ATP hydrolysis at the MalK subunits and eventually in substrate translocation (25.Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Experiments employing the transition state analog vanadate further suggested that binding of liganded MalE and ATP is occurring simultaneously and that a transiently stable complex of MalFGK2 with MalE is formed (26.Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Vanadate traps ADP in one of the two nucleotide-binding sites locking the transport complex in the transition state conformation, thereby inhibiting subsequent ATP hydrolysis (27.Hunke S. Dröse S. Schneider E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recent spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided evidence that closure of the MalK dimer interface coincides with the opening of MalE and maltose release to the transporter (29.Austermuhle M.I. Hall J.A. Klug C.S. Davidson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28243-28250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The transition state for ATP hydrolysis is also proposed to be represented by mutations in MalF and MalG that allow transport of maltose in the absence of MalE albeit with lower efficiency (22.Mannering D.E. Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12362-12368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25.Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other candidate residues for which conformational changes have been demonstrated are located in the helical subdomain of MalK (24.Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31.Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1432-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and in the LSGGQ motif (32.Schmees G. Stein A. Hunke S. Landmesser H. Schneider E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 420-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although ATP-induced conformational changes of the MalK subunits in solution (8.Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15526-15534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have been well documented, only little is known on concomitant conformational changes of the membrane-integral subunits MalFG that are supposed to form the translocation pore. In this communication we have addressed this question by employing limited proteolysis to demonstrate conformational changes in the MalFGK2 complex at different stages of the transport cycle. We found that tryptic cleavage sites in the second periplasmic loop of MalF and in the first periplasmic loop of MalG became more accessible to the protease in the presence of ATP, suggesting conformational changes of both subunits. This notion was strengthened by measuring the fluorescence of the transporter labeled with an extrinsic probe in MalF and MalG, respectively. Similar proteolytic fragments as found for the ATP-bound wild type complex were obtained with BPI (binding protein-independent) mutant and with transport complexes containing the MalK variants Q140L and E159Q, respectively, but in the absence of ATP or other cofactors. In contrast, the tryptic digestion profiles of a variant containing MalKQ140K resembled those of wild type in the absence of cofactors but did not change in the presence of ATP. These findings support the view that each of these mutations affect the conformational status of the transporter, albeit with different consequences on functionality. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain JM109 (Stratagene) was used as a general host for the plasmids listed in Table 1. The plasmid-bourne mal alleles originate from S. typhimurium except the malF malG alleles on pAW3, pMM38, and pDE17, which are from E. coli. The mal genes from both organisms are functionally fully exchangeable (24.Hunke S. Mourez M. Jéhanno M. Dassa E. Schneider E. J. Biol.

The resin was washed with buffer B (20 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.01% DDM), and protein was eluted with buffer C (50 mm imidazole, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.01% DDM). The peak fractions were pooled, passed through a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 0,01% DDM), concentrated by ultrafiltration, shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C.

Briefly, vanadate was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to a mixture containing 6 μm MalFGK2 complex, 12 μm MalE, 15 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm maltose in buffer D, and the reaction was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C unless indicated otherwise. For fluorescence measurements the samples were then desalted by passage through PD10. Stable association of MalE with the trapped complexes was confirmed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Limited Proteolysis by Trypsin—Treatment of transport complexes with trypsin was carried out as described in Ref. 21.Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Protein Determination—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit from Bio-Rad. MIANS Modification of Transport Complexes—MIANS was purchased from Molecular Probes (via Invitrogen). For MIANS modification studies, transport complexes were labeled in buffer D by incubation at 4 °C with 10 μm MIANS for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 1 mm dithiothreitol, and excess MIANS was removed from the protein sample by a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) or by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography.

Fluorescence spectra for MIANS-labeled proteins in buffer D were recorded using an excitation wavelength of 340 nm (slit width 4 nm) and an emission range of 360–600 nm (slit width, 4 nm) at 25 °C. N-terminal Sequence Analysis—Determination of the N-terminal sequence of tryptic fragments was carried out as described in Ref. 21.Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol.

Briefly, 12 lanes of an SDS gel were loaded each with 20 μg of vanadate-trapped wild type complex previously treated with trypsin (ratio, 50:1 w/w) for 8 min. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electroblotted on a polyvinyliden difluoride membrane and further treated as described (21.Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NanoLC-MS/MS Analysis—Fragments MalF-F1, MalG-G1, and MalK-K1 were generated from vanadate-trapped complex by trypsin treatment (50:1) (see above) and separated by SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie R, protein bands of the expected molecular masses were excised, destained with 30% acetonitrile, shrunk with 100% acetonitrile, and dried in a Vacuum Concentrator (Concentrator 5301; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Digests with trypsin were performed overnight at 37 °C in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8). About 0.1 μg of protease was used for one gel band. The peptides were extracted from the gel slices with 5% formic acid. Tryptic digests were analyzed by nanoLC-MS/MS using a nano-high pressure liquid chromatography system (CapLC; Micromass, Manchester, UK) and a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof micro; Micromass). A 50-μm-inner diameter trap column (C18 reversed phase, 5-μm particle size, 120-Å pore size, 2-cm length; NanoSeparations, Nieuwkoop, The Netherlands) and a 25-μm-inner diameter analytical column (C18 reversed phase, 5-μm particle size, 120-Å pore size, 20-cm length; NanoSeparations) were used for nanoLC separations. An electrospray ionization emitter (360-μm outer diameter, 20-μm inner diameter, 5-μm tip inner diameter, distal coated) was obtained from NewObjective (Woburn, MA). A linear gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile in 30 min with a flow rate of 25 nl/min was applied for peptide separation. A Mascot Distiller (Matrix Science, London, UK) was used to create peak lists from MS and MS/MS raw data. Mascot Server (Matrix Science) was used for data base searching. Peptides from the Mascot result file were checked manually.

The extensive inflammatory response observed in H. pylori-infected patients contributes to gastric damage; some of this damage is mediated by ROI/RNIs 3The abbreviations used are: ROI/RNI, reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediate; Trx, thioredoxin; Asf, arginase stimulatory factor; GSNO, S-nitrosoglutathione; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; SIN-1, 3-morpholinosydnonimine; DETA/NO, diethylene triamine-nitric oxide; MS, mass spectrometry. such as NO and hydrogen peroxide. Arginase (RocF), which hydrolyzes l-arginine to urea and l-ornithine, inhibits macrophage NO production by directly competing with host nitric-oxide synthase for arginine availability (3Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y. Mobley H.L. Wilson K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13844-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The urea can then be hydrolyzed by the copious H. pylori urease to yield carbon dioxide and ammonium, the latter of which neutralizes gastric acid. Indeed, acid treatment (pH 2) of H. pylori in the presence of arginine protects H. pylori in an arginase-dependent fashion (4McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The arginase of H. pylori exhibits several unusual features, including optimal catalytic activity with cobalt, rather than manganese, and an acidic pH optimum (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H. pylori arginase inhibits human T cell proliferation and T cell CD3ζ expression by siphoning arginine away from the host cell (6Zabaleta J. McGee D.J. Zea A.H. Hernandez C.P. Rodriguez P.C. Sierra R.A. Correa P. Ochoa A.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 586-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), potentially contributing to the inability of T cells to clear H. pylori infections. These findings point to a critical role for arginase in disarming two innate host defenses (acid and NO) and adaptive immunity (T cells), thereby disabling the two arms of the immune system. The critical questions remaining are: how is arginase modulated, and is arginase itself sensitive to ROI/RNIs? Here, we provide compelling evidence that H. pylori arginase is modulated at the post-translational level by thioredoxin 1 (Trx1) and that Trx1 protects arginase from ROI/RNIs and is an arginase chaperone. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Plasmids—Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37 °C in standard medium plus appropriate antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline). H. pylori strains were cultured at 37 °C on Campylobacter agar containing 10% (v/v) defibrinated sheep blood in a microaerobic environment for 2 days in 5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85% N2 in humidified air. Kanamycin (5–10 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml), or both antibiotics were added to the growth medium, as appropriate. Standard molecular biology procedures were used.

The J75 rocF mutant was constructed by transformation of wild type J75 with chromosomal DNA from the rocF mutant of strain 26695 and confirmed as described previously (4McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ureA/rocF double mutant was constructed by transforming the rocF mutant of strain 43504 with pHP902-ureA::cat (7Slonczewski J.L. McGee D.J. Phillips J. Kirkpatrick C. Mobley H.L. Helicobacter. 2000; 5: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to yield an urease- and arginase-null strain that was resistant to both kanamycin and chloramphenicol. The trxA1 mutant was constructed in strain 26695 by transformation with pSLC7 (8Comtois S.L. Gidley M.D. Kelly D.J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The trxA2 mutant has been described previously (8Comtois S.L. Gidley M.D. Kelly D.J. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Differential Ultracentrifugation—French press (20,000 p.s.i.; two passages) lysates of the arginase/urease (rocF/ureA) double mutant of H. pylori strain 43504 were differentially centrifuged (TL-100 Beckman ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.3 rotor), and the membrane-enriched fraction (pellet of a 70,000 rpm centrifugation corresponding to 200,000 × g; 70K pellet) was retained. The corresponding supernatant (70K supe) was also retained. The fractions were assayed for arginase stimulatory factor (Asf) activity by addition to purified His6-RocF. Preparation of Bacterial Extracts—Ice bath-sonicated extracts were prepared as described previously (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Soluble material from a low speed centrifugation (12,000 × g) was retained. Purification of RocF, Trx1, and Trx2—His6-RocF (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) were purified as described. Previously, we were unable to establish dialysis conditions that still yielded catalytically active arginase (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In this study, His6-RocF was dialyzed in 1 liter of 10 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, overnight at 4 °C. His6-RocF was diluted 1:2 in 100% sterile glycerol and stored at –20 °C. Under these conditions, His6-RocF retained catalytic activity following dialysis. Protein Gels—SDS-PAGE was conducted by standard methods and stained with Coomassie Blue. Affinity Chromatography of Arginase in the Absence or Presence of the H. pylori 70K Supe or 70K Pellet—XL1-Blue MRF′ pQE30-rocF (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was grown in L broth and induced 3 h with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (2 mm). French press (16,000 p.s.i.) lysates were clarified by centrifugation and the soluble fraction incubated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (1 ml/10 mg of protein) (Qiagen). The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) and then the 70K supe or pellet was added (∼600 μg of protein). After 1 h of end-over-end incubation (4 °C), the resin was washed again five times with wash buffer. The proteins were coeluted with 275 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). Preparation of Peptides for Mass Spectrometric Analysis and Protein Sequencing—Bands of interest were excised from the gel and destained (200 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% methanol). The gel fragments were dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried by centrifugation under vacuum, and the proteins were denatured and reduced (8 m urea, 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (carboxyethyl) phosphine; Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 15 min. Iodoacetamide (50 mm; Sigma-Aldrich) was added as necessary to alkylate free sulfhydryls, and incubation was continued for an additional 15 min. The alkylating reagent was removed by three rounds of acetonitrile dehydration followed by rehydration in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac centrifuge, followed by trypsinization (0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate with 20 ng/μl trypsin; Promega) and incubated overnight (37 °C). Following digestion, the supernatant was retained, and additional peptides were extracted from the remaining gel fragments by agitation in 2% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid for 90 min. The combined supernatants were acidified (2% acetic acid) and then evaporated to dryness as above. The samples were rehydrated (15 μl of 2% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid) prior to analysis by the University of South Alabama Proteomics/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory. MS and MS/MS analyses were carried out using a Waters (Micromass) quadrupole time of fight Ultima™ API (Milford, MA) mass spectrometer. The samples were loaded into a Waters CapLC Autosampler for liquid chromatography-MS/MS. The data were acquired using the Masslynx software and converted into peak list files. These were searched with the MASCOT MS/MS ion search engine (www.matrixscience.com/cgi/search_form.pl?FORMVER=2&SEARCH=MIS) against the NCBI nonredundant primary sequence data base, allowing up to two miscuts (peptide tolerance = 0.2 Da; MS/MS ion tolerance = 0.2 Da). Additional searches were conducted using the eubacterial data base and the H. pylori 26695 genome (1Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P.

Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar) using the BLASTp algorithm at www.tigr.org. Cloning of hsp60 into pQE30—The hsp60 (groEL) coding region (bp 1–1641 of hp0010) was PCR-amplified from H. pylori strain 26695 using primers DM95-F1 (cgggatccATGGCAAAAGAAATCAAATTTTC; BamHI site underlined; non-hsp60 sequence in lowercase letters) and DM96-R1 (aactgcagTTACATCATGCCACCCATGC; PstI site underlined; non-hsp60 sequence in lowercase letters). The PCR product was digested with BamHI and PstI and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) predigested with the same enzymes to generate pQE30-hsp60. The construct was confirmed by sequencing, restriction enzyme digestion, and miniprotein expression analyses (data not shown). The fusion protein, His6-Hsp60, has a predicted molecular mass of 59.2 kDa. Purification of Hsp60—XL1-Blue MRF' pQE30-hsp60 (1.5 liters) was grown to mid-log phase and induced with isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (5 mm). The cultures were harvested in wash buffer, lysed by two passages through a French press, and clarified by centrifugation, and the cytosolic portion was loaded onto polypropylene columns (8.5 × 2.0 cm) containing nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin at 4 °C. The washes and elutions were conducted according to the manufacturer's specifications. The fractions were analyzed for the presence of His6-Hsp60 by SDS-PAGE. Urease Activity Measurements—Urease activity was measured by the phenol-hypochlorite assay as described previously (11McGee D.J. May C.A. Garner R.M. Himpsl J.M. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2477-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arginase Activity Measurements—Arginase activity was measured by colorimetric detection of ornithine in arginine buffer (15 mm MES, 10 mm arginine, pH 6.0) as described previously (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The data are in units of pmol or nmol l-ornithine/min/mg protein. During this study it was revealed that purified His6-RocF had catalytic activity when assayed without the 30-min 50–55 °C heat activation step, as long as cobalt (5 mm) was provided; therefore this extra step was omitted in the present study except where noted in the figure legends. The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), following the manufacturer's 30-min method. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. The unpaired, one-tailed t test was used to statistically analyze the data using Instat 3.05 (GaphPad Software, Inc.). p < 0.05 was considered significant. Fluorescence Spectra of Trx1—Purified Trx1 was rendered fully oxidized or fully reduced, and its fluorescence emission at different times was determined in the presence or absence of purified His6-RocF using previously established procedures (9Windle H.J. Fox A. Ni Eidhin D. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5081-5089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Chaperone Experiments—Arginase was denatured in 1 m urea. Arginase was renatured in 750 ml of 10 mm glycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, for 1 h in the presence or absence of Trx1 in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (7K; Pierce). The renaturation buffer was changed once and allowed to proceed another hour before the samples were removed and assayed for arginase activity. Treatment of Arginase with ROI/RNIs and Reversal or Protection by Trx1—Arginase ROI/RNI protection was assessed by preincubating Trx1 for 15 min on ice with ROI/RNIs followed by the addition of purified His6-RocF. Arginase activity was then immediately measured. Reversal of ROI/RNI-mediated damage to arginase by Trx1 was conducted by incubation of His6-RocF with ROI/RNI for 15 min, followed by the addition of purified Trx1. H. pylori Contains an Asf—To uncover proteins that affect arginase activity, we incubated purified His6-RocF (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with extracts from four H. pylori strains (J75, 43504, 26695, and SS1) in which the rocF gene encoding arginase had been disrupted. Although extracts from all four strains were completely devoid of arginase activity, these extracts all stimulated purified arginase activity (Fig. 1A), suggesting that the Asf is present in all H. pylori strains. Characterization of Asf and Identification of Asf as Thioredoxin 1—Previous work established that urease was not involved in arginase activity (4McGee D.J. Radcliff F.J. Mendz G.L. Ferrero R.L. Mobley H.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7314-7322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urease is the most abundant protein of H. pylori, accounting for 5–10% of the total cellular protein (12Bauerfeind P. Garner R. Dunn B.E. Mobley H.L. Gut. 1997; 40: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The urease abundance makes it arduous to purify other proteins. To facilitate further characterization of Asf, we constructed an arginase-urease (rocF/ureA) double mutant of H. pylori strain 43504 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The rocF/ureA mutant was devoid of both urease and arginase activities (data not shown). Lysates of the rocF/ureA mutant were differentially ultracentrifuged to yield cytosolic and membrane-enriched fractions (70K supe and 70K pellet, respectively; see “Experimental Procedures”). The 70K pellet, but not the 70K supe, stimulated purified arginase activity (Fig. 1B). Fractionation experiments using a 10-kDa membrane filtration device revealed that Asf was probably a protein greater than 10 kDa (Fig. 1C). The Asf was narrowed down to a handful of candidates by affinity chromatography. Purified arginase (His6-RocF) bound to nickel-nitriloacetic acid-agarose was incubated with either the 70K pellet, the 70K supe, or vehicle control (0.9% NaCl) (see “Experimental Procedures”). After binding, the samples were extensively washed and then the proteins eluted (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 70K pellet coelution was found to have 3.5-fold higher arginase activity than the 70K supe coelution and 5-fold higher arginase activity than arginase eluted by itself. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed approximately eight H. pylori proteins that coeluted with arginase and the 70K pellet fraction, whereas only several faintly staining H. pylori proteins coeluted with arginase and the 70K supe fraction (Fig. 2A). Gel slices were excised from the 70K pellet lane or from the corresponding molecular weight regions in the 70K supe or His6-RocF control lanes; the gel slices were analyzed by mass spectrometry (see “Experimental Procedures”). The proteins from the H. pylori 70K pellet sample were identified as several chaperone family members, fumarase, catalase, a putative thioester hydrolase, ferritin, neutrophil-activating protein (NapA; an iron-binding protein), and thioredoxin 1 (HP0824, Trx1) (Fig. 2A). Catalase (KatA) and NapA were not likely the Asf because katA or napA mutants had the same arginase activity as wild type H. pylori (data not shown). Hsp60 was also not likely involved because purified Hsp60 did not stimulate purified arginase activity (data not shown). Hsp60 and KatA may have coeluted because of their abundance in H. pylori. For the 70K supe sample, arginase coeluted with several faintly staining H. pylori proteins based on SDS-PAGE, but only one had high quality protein sequencing data, NapA; NapA was thus present in both samples, further supporting the conclusion that NapA is not likely the Asf. Trx1 (12 kDa) is discussed further, whereas the other protein candidates are under exploration elsewhere. H. pylori has two thioredoxins, Trx1 (HP0824) and Trx2 (HP1450), that share 35% amino acid identity and 57% similarity. Purified Trx1, but not Trx2, not only stimulated arginase activity from wild type H. pylori extracts (data not shown) but also stimulated purified arginase activity (Fig. 2B). The data indicated that arginase specifically discriminates between the two closely related thioredoxins. Purified Trx1 and Trx2 alone did not exhibit arginase activity and the buffer in which the purified thioredoxins were stored had no effect on arginase activity (data not shown). Stimulation of arginase activity by purified Trx1 was dose-dependent (Fig. 2C). Although a mutation in trxA1 coding for Trx1 reduced arginase activity by 50% (wild type, 6,044 ± 659 units; trxA1 mutant, 2,601 ± 191 units), a mutation in trxA2 encoding Trx2 had elevated arginase activity (19,035 ± 1,312 units). The reason for the arginase elevation in the trxA2 mutant is unclear, because Western blot analysis using anti-Trx1 polyclonal sera (9Windle H.J. Fox A. Ni Eidhin D. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5081-5089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) did not reveal an increase in Trx1 protein in the trxA2 mutant versus the wild type strain (data not shown). Trx1 Stimulation of Arginase Is Likely Independent of Redox Status—Thioredoxins normally target cytosolic proteins for cysteine reduction via disulfide reductase activity (13Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Trx1 has the conserved active site motif typical of thioredoxins, 26WCGPCK31, where the Cys residues are able to cycle through oxidized and reduced redox states. We therefore hypothesized that Trx1 was serving a redox role for arginase. Trx1 and His6-RocF were incubated together in the presence or absence of the sulfhydryl alkylating agent iodoacetamide, and the disulfide bond statuses of the two proteins were monitored by mass spectrometry in comparison with either protein alone. No evidence was obtained for a change in sulfhydryl status of either protein, but the results did reveal that Trx1 Cys27 and Cys30 form a disulfide bond, as expected from the literature on other thioredoxins (13Ritz D. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 21-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and His6-RocF Cys66 and Cys73 form a disulfide bond, explaining the previous observation that H. pylori arginase is sensitive to reducing agents (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). H. pylori arginase is the first example of an arginase displaying a disulfide bond. No mixed disulfide bonds between Trx1 and His6-RocF were detected, and no evidence for contaminating proteins in purified His6-RocF or Trx1 was found. The oxidized form of Trx1 (Trx1ox) displays much lower fluorescence intensity at its emission maximum (A340) than the reduced form (Trx1red) (9Windle H.J. Fox A. Ni Eidhin D. Kelleher D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5081-5089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). If the cysteines of His6-RocF were being oxidized by Trx1ox, resulting in Trx1red, then an increase in the fluorescence emission of Trx1ox would occur similar to that of Trx1red alone. The addition of purified His6-RocF to fully oxidized or reduced forms of Trx1 elevated fluorescence, but the fluorescence of the Trxox did not reach that of Trx1red levels prior to the addition of His6-RocF (Fig. 3). Taken together with the mass spectrometry results, the data suggest that the mechanism of Trx1-mediated stimulation of arginase is not likely due to redox control of cysteines. However, we have not completely eliminated this possibility. Evidence That Trx1 Stimulates Arginase by Acting as a Chaperone—Previous evidence revealed that purified His6-RocF rapidly loses catalytic activity when stored at 4 °C (<1 week) or –20 °C (∼4 months) (5McGee D.J. Zabaleta J. Viator R.J. Testerman T.L. Ochoa A.C. Mendz G.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1952-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), making it difficult to use the same batch of purified His6-RocF in multiple experiments or for an extended period of time. Remarkably, Trx1, but not Trx2, completely restored arginase activity to a catalytically inactive batch of arginase (Fig. 4A, p < 0.05 comparing RocF [I] versus RocF[I] + Trx1). Mass spectrometry revealed that Cys66 and Cys73 were oxidized in both catalytically active and inactive arginase batches, suggesting that the sulfhydryl status of the protein was not involved. It was therefore reasoned that rather than acting in a redox role, Trx1 may play an alternative role as an arginase chaperone. Support for this hypothesis comes from recent evidence showing that E. coli thioredoxin is involved in refolding heterologous proteins containing cysteines (porcine citrate synthase, yeast α-glucosidase) as well as an E. coli protein devoid of cysteines (galactose receptor) (14Kern R. Malki A. Holmgren A. Richarme G. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). E. coli thioredoxin was able to restore only up to 30% of the enzymatic activity of the target protein. H. pylori His6-RocF was 90% denatured (based on 90% loss of catalytic activity) in urea (1 m) (Fig. 4B). When arginase was dialyzed to remove the urea, little to no catalytic activity was restored (Fig. 4C, p < 0.05 comparing control versus denatured and dialyzed), suggesting very little renaturation of arginase can occur when the enzyme is by itself. However, if arginase was allowed to renature in the presence of purified Trx1, arginase activity was completely restored (Fig. 4D, p < 0.05 comparing denatured and dialyzed versus denatured and dialyzed + Trx1). If Trx1 was added to denatured His6-RocF that had not been permitted to renature, activity was only partially restored. These results suggest that Trx1-mediated stimulation of arginase activity is through a chaperone-like mechanism whereby Trx1 refolds arginase to the catalytically more active state. To assess an independent type of denaturation, heat was chosen. Two types of experiments were conducted: (i) protection experiments, in which Trx1 and His6-RocF were coincubated together in the presence of heat followed by measurement of arginase activity, and (ii) reversal experiments, in which His6-RocF was first heated, and then Trx1 was added, followed by measurement of arginase activity. It was discovered that Trx1-mediated stimulation of arginase was enhanced by preincubation of the His6-RocF-Trx1 complex at 55 °C (Fig. 4D), further suggesting a role of Trx1 in folding arginase to an improved catalytic three-dimensional conformation. Above 55 °C there was a steep decline in Trx1-mediated arginase stimulation suggestive of a loss of Trx1 chaperone function. Trx1 stimulation of arginase occurred optimally when both Trx1 and cobalt were present (Fig. 4E) and was rapid (Fig. 4F). If Trx1 or cobalt were added after heat treatment rather than during heat treatment, arginase activity was lower but still higher than arginase assayed without Trx1 (Fig. 4, D and E). The Trx1-mediated chaperoning of arginase increased with increasing cobalt concentrations (Fig. 4G), but the identical shapes of the two curves did not lend support to a direct role of Trx1 as a cobalt chaperone. We reason that if Trx1 was a cobalt chaperone, there would have been a change in the shape of the curve from a hyperbolic for arginase alone to a sigmoidal curve for arginase plus Trx1. Trx1 Protects Arginase from Oxidative and Nitrosative Stresses—Trx1 and Trx2 have recently been shown to play critical roles in the ability of H. pylori to overcome oxidative and nitrosative stresses (8Comtois S.L.

Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)) and Trx2 are largely unknown. ROI/RNIs exhibiting distinct in vivo properties (15Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) (hydrogen peroxide, methyl viologen (a superoxide generator), hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (a superoxide generator), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO, a NO· (nitric oxide radical) and NO+ donor), sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitrosating agent mainly producing NO+), 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1, a peroxynitrite generator), and diethylene triamine-nitric oxide (DETA/NO, slowly releases NO·)) were coincubated with arginase and either Trx1 or buffer control, followed by assessment of arginase activity. This experiment assesses whether Trx1 protects arginase from ROI/RNIs. In the absence of Trx1, arginase was found to be exquisitely sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and SNP, moderately sensitive to GSNO, sensitive to DETA/NO and SIN-1 only at high concentrations, and completely resistant to methyl viologen and hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase (Table 1). Both wild type and rocF mutant H. pylori were shown to be equally sensitive to methyl viologen in a disc diffusion assay (zone of inhibition = 47 mm for both strains), indicating that the reagent was active and functional. Disc diffusion experiments with the other ROI/RNIs also revealed no significant differences between wild type H. pylori SS1 and the rocF mutant (data not shown), suggesting that the mechanism of ROI/RNI-mediated H. pylori killing is arginase-independent.TABLE 1Arginase activity inhibition by ROI/RNIsROI/RNIIC50aConcentration that inhibits arginase activity by 50%.

The values are the averages of at least three experiments. Open table in a new tab Using concentrations of ROI/RNIs that inhibited arginase by ∼50%, we next determined whether Trx1 had any effect on ROI/RNI-treated arginase. Remarkably, Trx1 protected arginase from ROI/RNIs, with protection levels varying depending on the compound (Fig. 5, A and B; p < 0.05 comparing ROI/RNI treatment of arginase versus ROI/RNI treatment plus Trx1); protection from GSNO and SNP-mediated damage was most dramatic (Fig. 5B). Reversal experiments were also conducted in which His6-RocF was pretreated with ROI/RNIs followed by the addition of Trx1. These experiments suggested that Trx1 completely reversed damage to arginase by DETA/NO, SIN-1, and hydrogen peroxide, but GSNO and SNP-treated arginase had lower activity after Trx1 addition than when Trx1 was present during GSNO or SNP treatment (Fig. 5, C and D; p < 0.05 comparing ROI/RNI treatment of arginase versus ROI/RNI treatment plus Trx1; p < 0.05 comparing GSNO or SNP treatment of arginase plus Trx1 coincubation versus GSNO or SNP treatment of arginase plus Trx1 postincubation). Taken together, the results suggest that Trx1 can especially reverse peroxynitrite, NO, and hydrogen peroxide-mediated arginase damage while also being able to protect arginase from NO-mediated damage. The highly homologous Trx2 had little or no effect on either protection or reversal of ROI/RNI-mediated damage to arginase, demonstrating specificity (data not shown). H. pylori encounters diverse adverse conditions in the gastric environment and yet has evolved strategies to escape acid (16Marshall B.J. Barrett L.J. Prakash C. McCallum R.W. Guerrant R.L. Gastroenterology. 1990; 99: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), gastric epithelial cell exfoliation by motility (17Eaton K.A. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S. J. Med. Microbiol. 1992; 37: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and ROI/RNIs. ROI/RNIs contribute to the gastric damage in H. pylori-infected patients and may be responsible for mutations in genes that lead to stomach cancer (18Ernst P. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Nardone G. Rocco A. Malfertheiner P. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 20: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because copious ROI/RNIs are rapidly generated from infiltrating inflammatory cells following adherence of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells (19Nardone G. Rocco A. Malfertheiner P. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 20: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), the bacterium must be equipped with an immediately available system to overcome this onslaught of potentially toxic redox compounds. In addition to the established role of Trx1 as a disulfide reductase that reduces H. pylori AhpC (10Baker L.M. Raudonikiene A. Hoffman P.S. Poole L.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1961-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), Trx1 has two additional functions revealed in this study. First, Trx1 serves as a chaperone that converts denatured or suboptimally folded arginase into its optimal three-dimensional catalytically active structure. Second, Trx1 not only protects arginase against oxidative and nitrosative-mediated stress, it can detoxify the damage. Whether Trx1 acts as a guardian for other H. pylori enzymes is unknown. Post-translational modulation of H. pylori arginase by Trx1 may have evolved as a specialized adaptation for the unique gastric lifestyle of H. pylori. Because H. pylori urease is required for colonization (20Eaton K.A. Brooks C.L. Morgan D.R. Krakowka S. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2470-2475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the urea substrate for urease may derive from the bacterial arginase when the host is faced with a deluge of ROI/RNIs. Supporting this model is the finding that expression of host arginases is diminished when NO is elevated (21Satriano J. Amino Acids. 2004; 26: 321-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This delicate balance of host ROI/RNIs is also manipulated by H. pylori arginase itself, because arginase can decrease NO production by the host (3Gobert A.P. McGee D.J. Akhtar M. Mendz G.L. Newton J.C. Cheng Y. Mobley H.L. Wilson K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13844-13849Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, Trx1-mediated protection of arginase from ROI/RNIs may allow H. pylori arginase to remain active even in the face of elevated ROI/RNI levels and provide the necessary urea required by urease so that the ammonium generated can protect H. pylori from gastric acid. H. pylori is equipped with a “renox guardian” comprised of Trx1 and arginase that helps the bacterium overcome reactive nitrogen and oxygen stresses. This allows the arginase to remain functional and provide an endogenous urea source for the bacterium when the H. pylori encounters host ROI/RNIs and meager host urea availability. This protective system could be responsible for the exceptional ability of H. pylori to persist for decades in the hostile gastric environment.

Foster for stimulating discussions."

However, recent studies have shown that differential compartmentalization of PELP1 could play a crucial role in modulating the status of nongenomic signaling by using molecular mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) is an early endosomal protein that plays a role in regulating the trafficking of growth factor-receptor complexes through early endosomes. By using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified HRS as a novel PELP1-binding protein providing evidence of a physiologic interaction between HRS and PELP1. The noted HRS-PELP1 interaction was accompanied by inhibition of the basal coactivator function of PELP1 upon estrogen receptor transactivation. HRS was found to sequester PELP1 in the cytoplasm, leading to the activation of MAPK in a manner that is dependent on the epidermal growth factor receptor but independent of the estrogen receptor, Shc, and Src. In addition, stimulation of MAPK and the subsequent activation of its downstream effector pathway, Elk-1, by HRS or PELP1 were found to depend on the presence of endogenous PELP1 or HRS. Furthermore, HRS was overexpressed and correlated well with the cytoplasmic PELP1, increased MAPK, and EGFR status in breast tumors. These findings highlight a novel role of HRS in up-regulating MAPK, presumably involving interaction with PELP1.

PELP1 is identical to the modulator of nongenomic activity of the estrogen receptor, which has been implicated in the nongenomic stimulation of the Src/MAPK pathways by the estrogen receptor (ER) (4.Wong C.W.

PELP1 is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in a significant proportion of the human breast (5.Vadlamudi R.K. Manavathi B. Balasenthil S. Nair S.S. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7724-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), endometrial (3.Vadlamudi R.K. Balasenthil S. Broaddus R.R. Gustafsson J.A. Kumar R. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Pathol. 2005; 36: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), so PELP1-induced nongenomic signaling is expected to have physiological implications in breast cancer tumorigenesis. Although PELP1 has been implicated in the nongenomic stimulation of signaling kinases and interacts with Src, the nature of the upstream determinants of its nongenomic action remains unknown.To understand better the cellular functions of PELP1 in breast cancer cells, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to clone PELP1-interacting proteins from the human mammary gland cDNA library. One of the several isolates was identified as the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS), which was originally identified as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in melanoma cells stimulated with hepatocyte growth factor. Subsequent studies established that HRS is ubiquitously expressed, and its phosphorylation is induced by a variety of polypeptide growth factors and cytokines (7.Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 8.Urbe S. Mills I.G. Stenmark H. Kitamura N. Clague M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7685-7692Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). HRS is an essential protein, and targeted disruption of HRS in mice embryos is lethal (9.Komada M. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1475-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). HRS consists of a VHS domain, a clathrin box domain, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-interacting FYVE domain, two coiled-coiled domains, a proline domain, and a proline/glutamine-rich domain. HRS is localized in both cytosolic and membrane-associated compartments, and such targeting is presumably regulated by the intracellular level of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, leading to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate interaction with the FYVE domain and membrane targeting (10.Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In addition, HRS also interacts with signaling and trafficking molecules, such as STAM, Smad2, EPS15, SNAP25, and clathrin (11.Asao H. Sasaki Y. Arita T. Tanaka N. Endo K. Kasai H. Takeshita T.

HRS is localized both in the early endosomes and cytosol, and it is widely believed to act as an integrator of vesicular trafficking and signaling (16.Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20538-20544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17.Komada M. Kitamura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 1065-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and thus is implicated in endosomal EGFR sorting (18.Morino C. Kato M. Yamamoto A. Mizuno E. Hayakawa A. Komada M. Kitamura N. Exp. Cell. Res. 2004; 297: 380-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, HRS promotes down-regulation of multiple signaling pathways, and Drosophila epithelial cells lacking HRS show elevated signaling components, because of a defect in sorting and degradation of receptors (19.Haglund K. Sigismund S. Polo S. Szymkiewicz I. Di Fiore P.P. Dikic I. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2003; 5: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). More importantly, HRS-mediated receptor degradation in Drosophila was found to be ligand-independent (20.Jekely G. Rorth P. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1163-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HRS has been also shown to play a role in interleukin-2-mediated c-fos induction of B cells (21.Sasaki Y. Sugamura K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29943-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although HRS plays an important role in signaling and protein routing, it remains unknown whether HRS could also influence the strength of the MAPK pathway in cancer cells.In this study, we found that HRS directly interacts with PELP1 and impairs its nuclear ER transactivation function, and it plays an essential role in supporting the ability of PELP1 to stimulate MAPK in a manner independent of Src and Shc. HRS-mediated MAPK stimulation was accompanied by increased secondary genomic responses, such as Elk-1 activation. In addition, HRS was up-regulated in human breast tumors with increased MAPK, EGFR, and cytoplasmic PELP1. For the first time, these findings have exposed a novel connection among HRS, PELP1, and MAPK and revealed the existence of regulatory interactions between HRS and functions of PELP1 in breast cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Cultures and Reagents—MCF-7, HeLa, COS-7, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, ZR-75, and MCF-7/PELP1 clones were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Antibodies against vinculin, FLAG, epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the steroid hormone 17β-estradiol were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against AKT, phospho-AKT, and phospho-p44/42(Thr-202/Tyr-204) were purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies for EGFR was from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Erk-1 and -2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody for Src and the specific Src kinase inhibitor PP2 was purchased from Calbiochem. HRS antibody was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Antibody against T7 was purchased from Novagen. Charcoal-stripped serum (DCC serum) and ICI 182,780 was purchased from Sigma. Iressa (ZD1839) was from AstraZeneca (Macclesfield, UK).Cell Extracts, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were prepared using Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). The lysates were centrifuged in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein (100 μg) were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (8% acrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed with the appropriate antibodies, and developed using either the enhanced chemiluminescence method or the alkaline phosphatase-based color reaction method. Immunoprecipitation was performed for 4 h at 4°C using 1 μg of antibody/mg of protein.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—HRS-specific, PELP1-specific, Shc-specific, and control nonspecific siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). siRNA transfections were performed using 100 nm of pooled siRNA duplexes and 4 μl of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol in 6-well plates. After 72 h, cells were prepared for Western blotting and luciferase assay.Confocal Microscopy and Immunohistochemistry—The cellular localization of various proteins was determined by indirect immunofluorescence, as described previously (1.Nair S.S. Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6416-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were incubated with the primary antibodies, washed three times in PBS, and then incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa-546 (red) and Alexa-488 (green). Cells treated with only the secondary antibodies served as controls. Confocal scanning analysis was performed by using an Olympus FV300 laser-scanning confocal microscope according to established methods. Each section was examined for each stain at three excitations (488, 546, and 633 nm), and the data were compared pixel by pixel. Untransfected and HRS-transfected cells were examined for the reduction of nuclear PELP1. Cells were grouped into two groups, less than 50% reduction of nuclear PELP1 and more than 50% reduction of nuclear PELP1, compared with the intensity of the cells expressing the highest amount of nuclear PELP1 in that field. Counts were added and plotted in a bar graph.Immunohistochemical detection of HRS, PELP1, EGFR, and phospho-MAPK was carried out in well studied breast cancer sections (2.Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Briefly, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated using graded ethanol solutions. Sections were incubated in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and methanol for 30 min to inactivate the endogenous peroxidase. The sections were then boiled for 10 min in 0.01 m citrate buffer and cooled for 30 min at room temperature to expose antigenic epitopes. The sections were blocked with 2% normal goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin and PBS for 30 min and then incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies against HRS (1:250 dilution (Alexis), PELP1 (1:500), and EGFR (1:50 dilution (Neomarkers)) and phospho-MAPK (1:50 dilution (Cell Signaling)). Primary antibodies were diluted in diluent buffer (2% normal goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and PBS). For HRS and PELP1, the sections were washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min, incubated with horseradish peroxidase/secondary antibody at a 1:100 dilution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h, and then washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min. For phospho-MAPK and EGFR, the sections were washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min, incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody at a 1:100 dilution (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, then washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min, incubated with a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase reagent (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 15 min, and washed three times with 0.05% Tween in PBS for 10 min. The sections were then developed with diaminobenzidine/H2O2 and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin.Reporter Gene Assays—For reporter gene transient transfections, cells were cultured for 48 h in minimal essential medium without phenol red, containing 5% DCC serum. Next, 200 ng of estrogen-response element-luciferase reporter constructs were cotransfected with or without 0.5 μg of HRS and PELP1 plasmid using the FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Twenty four hours later, cells were treated with estrogen (10-9 m) for 24 h. Cells were then lysed with passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase assay was performed using a kit (Promega, Madison, WI). β-Galactosidase activity was used to normalize the transfection. Each transfection was performed in 6-well plates in triplicate. For treatment with EGF, cells were serum-starved for 48 h before being treated. Elk-1 luciferase assay was performed according to the kit protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).RESULTSPELP1 Interacts with HRS in Vitro and in Vivo—To gain insights about novel functions of PELP1, and a potential biochemical basis of its cytoplasmic localization, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with PELP1. Screening of a mammary gland cDNA expression library with the N-terminal region of PELP1 as bait resulted in the isolation of several positive clones. One of the positive clone sequences matched HRS. The specificity of the HRS and PELP1 interaction was confirmed by the conventional survival assay in selection medium where transformed colonies showed the ability to grow in medium lacking adenosine, histidine, tryptophan, and leucine. Cells cotransformed with the control GBD vector did not grow. To map the region of PELP1 that interacts with HRS, we cotransformed GAD-HRS along with the GBD-PELP1 fusion constructs (amino acids 1–400, 400–600, 600–880, and 960–1130) into yeast cells, and the interaction was assessed by monitoring the growth of yeast cells on selective media. These results suggested that HRS interacts with PELP1 in the region of amino acids 1–400 (Fig. 1A).To confirm the interaction between PELP1 and HRS, we next sought to determine in vivo interaction between HRS and PELP1. Currently available HRS and PELP1 (2.Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) antibodies are not suitable for immunoprecipitation assays, so we transiently transfected HeLa cells with T7-HRS to verify the interaction between HRS and PELP1 in mammalian cells. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with T7 antibody and subjected to Western blotting with PELP1 or T7 antibodies (Fig. 1B). Similarly, cell lysates from well characterized MCF-7/T7-PELP1 stable clones (5.Vadlamudi R.K. Manavathi B. Balasenthil S. Nair S.S. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7724-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were immunoprecipitated with T7 antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with HRS or T7 antibodies (Fig. 1C). Together, these results showed that PELP1 interacts with HRS in vivo.HRS Sequesters PELP1 in the Cytoplasm—To confirm further the interaction between HRS and PELP1 in situ, we examined the subcellular localization of HRS and PELP1. Results from confocal microscopy of MCF-7 cells transfected with T7-tagged HRS showed that HRS was localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, middle panel). In the control cells, PELP1 was localized in the nuclear compartment and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, left panel) as expected from the previous studies (2.Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, when T7-HRS was overexpressed, most of the endogenous PELP1 was sequestered in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D, right panel), shown by a reduced nuclear staining and a more intense cytoplasmic staining for PELP1. T7-tagged HRS also colocalized with PELP1 in the cytoplasm of the cell, visualized as yellow in Fig. 1D. To confirm the observed relocalization of PELP1 by HRS overexpression, we quantitated the reduction of nuclear PELP1 in multiple fields of HRS transfected as well as control vector-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, the number of cells with reduced nuclear PELP1 after HRS overexpression is dramatically increased as compared with untransfected cells. In addition, biochemical fractionation studies from MCF-7 cells transfected with HRS also showed an increased accumulation of PELP1 in the cytoplasm and a corresponding reduced nuclear PELP1 in HRS-transfected cells (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data suggest an important role for HRS in the cytoplasmic sequestration of PELP1.HRS Inhibits Basal ER Transactivation Functions of PELP1—Recent studies suggest that PELP1 acts as a coactivator of ER (2.Vadlamudi R.K.

Mishra S.K. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6416-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). HRS sequesters PELP1 in the cytoplasm, so we next sought to determine the effect of its sequestration on nuclear functions of PELP1. To examine this effect, we determined the status of ER transactivation in cells with overexpressed HRS. Cotransfection of PELP1 with HRS significantly reduced basal ER transactivation function of PELP1. However, there was no significant effect of HRS on estradiol-induced fold induction of ER transactivation in the presence of PELP1 (Fig. 2A). Because it is known that PELP1 also promotes EGF-mediated ER transactivation (22.Manavathi B. Nair S.S. Wang R.A. Kumar R. Vadlamudi R.K. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5571-5577Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we next examined whether HRS had any effect on this activity. Cotransfection of PELP1 with HRS substantially reduced the basal ER transactivation of PELP1 (Fig. 2B). These findings suggested that HRS suppresses PELP1 nuclear functions, presumably by its cytoplasmic retention.FIGURE 2HRS inhibits basal ER transcription functions of PELP1. A, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with the ERE-luciferase reporter with or without HRS and PELP1 in 5% DCC media. After 24 h, the cells were treated with estradiol (E2) (10-9 m) for 24 h, and then the ERE reporter activity was measured. B, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with ERE-luciferase reporter gene along with or without HRS and PELP1. After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved and treated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 8 h, and the ERE reporter activity was measured. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HRS Modulation of MAPK Signaling—Recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic PELP1 promotes activation of the MAPK and Akt pathways (5.Vadlamudi R.K. Manavathi B. Balasenthil S. Nair S.S. Yang Z. Sahin A.A. Kumar R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7724-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that HRS sequesters PELP1 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1D), we hypothesized that HRS might up-regulate MAPK and Akt pathways. Expression of FLAG-HRS in MCF-7 cells resulted in a clear up-regulation of phospho-MAPK without any change in the levels of phospho-Akt (Fig. 3A). To examine the contribution of endogenous HRS in MAPK activation in MCF-7 cells, we knocked down endogenous HRS by using HRS-specific siRNA. We found reduced levels of phosphorylated MAPK in cells with depleted HRS (Fig. 3B), suggesting a role for HRS in the stimulation of MAPK activation. Because we identified HRS as a PELP1-interacting protein, we next examined whether PELP1 and HRS cooperated in stimulating MAPK activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, HRS expression in MCF-7/PELP1 cells was accompanied by a significant up-regulation of phosphorylated MAPK. However, the extent of MAPK activation after the stimulation with the ligand was similar with or without HRS.FIGURE 3HRS selectively modulates MAPK activation. A, exponentially growing MCF-7 cells in 10% serum were transfected with or without HRS, and total lysates were immunoblotted with a phospho-MAPK-specific antibody. B, MCF-7 cells were transfected with control or HRS-specific siRNA. After 48 h, cell lysates were immunoblotted with a phospho-MAPK-specific antibody. C, MCF-7 cells stably expressing pcDNA or T7-PELP1 were transfected with or without FLAG-HRS and treated with estradiol (E2) for 10 min, and MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blotting analysis using a phospho-specific antibody. The results shown are representative of three separate experiments. Con, control; RNAi, RNA interference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To validate these findings, we next knocked down HRS in MCF-7/PELP1 cells. Most interestingly, we noticed that depletion of HRS in MCF-7/PELP1 cells resulted in a significant reduction in the level of phospho-MAPK (Fig. 4A), suggesting a role of HRS in the earlier reported up-regulation of phospho-MAPK by PELP1. Consistent with this, we found that depletion of endogenous PELP1 in MCF-7 compromised the ability of HRS to stimulate MAPK activation (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4HRS requirement for MAPK activation. A, MCF-7 cells stably expressing pcDNA or PELP1 were transfected with control or HRS siRNA. After 48 h, MAPK activation was analyzed by Western blotting. B, MCF-7 cells transfected with or without FLAG-HRS were again transfected with the control or PELP1-specific siRNA, and total lysates were immunoblotted with a phospho-MAPK-specific antibody. The results shown are the representative of three separate experiments. RNAi, RNA interference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The observed MAPK stimulation by HRS was independent of ER, as pure anti-estrogen ICI 182,780 had no effect on the levels of phospho-MAPK induced by HRS (Fig. 5A). HRS up-regulation of phospho-MAPK was also observed in ER-negative MDA-MB-435 and COS-7 cells, further confirming that it is ER-independent (Fig. 5B). These observations suggested that both PELP1 and HRS are required for the efficient stimulation of phospho-MAPK in cancer cells.FIGURE 5HRS regulation of MAPK is ER-independent. A, MCF-7 cells transfected with FLAG-HRS were treated with or without ICI 182,780 (10-8 m) for 48 h. Total cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting using phospho-MAPK antibody.

These findings together raise the possibility that the growth factor pathway is involved in the up-regulation of phospho-MAPK by HRS. However, we found that serum deprivation had no effect on the ability of HRS to stimulate MAPK (Fig. 6A). Next, we examined the effect of depleting Shc on the levels of phospho-MAPK activation in cells with HRS up-regulation. As expected, Shc down-regulation was accompanied by reduced MAPK activation; however, the extent of MAPK activation by HRS was similar in cells with or without depleted Shc (Fig. 6B). PELP1 has been shown to activate MAPK via its interaction with Src kinase (4.Wong C.W. McNally C. Nickbarg E. Komm B.S. Cheskis B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and because HRS is a PELP1-interacting protein, so we sought to determine whether HRS-mediated MAPK stimulation requires Src kinase. Transfection of Syf cells (Src-null cells) with FLAG-HRS resulted in up-regulation of MAPK (Fig. 6C), suggesting that HRS-mediated MAPK up-regulation is independent of the ability of PELP1 to interact with Src kinase. This was further confirmed by using a specific Src kinase inhibitor (PP2) in MCF-7 cells transfected with HRS. PP2 reduced the basal level of phosphorylation, although there was no effect on HRS-induced MAPK activation (Fig. 6D). However, the observed HRS-m"

Selenium, a selenocysteine incorporation sequence in the 3'-untranslated region of the glutathione peroxidase mRNA, and other translational cofactors are necessary for of a UGA stop codon that specifies selenocysteine incorporation. Aminoglycoside antibiotics facilitate read-through of premature stop codons in prokayotes and eukaryotes. We studied the effects of G418, an aminoglycoside, on cellular glutathione peroxidase expression and function in mammalian cells. Insertion of a selenocysteine incorporation element along with a UGA codon into a reporter construct allows for read-through only in the presence of selenium. G418 increased read-through in selenium-replete cells as well as in the absence of selenium. G418 treatment increased immunodetectable endogenous or recombinant glutathione peroxidase but reduced the specific activity of the enzyme. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments indicated that G418 caused a substitution of l-arginine for selenocysteine. These data show that G418 can affect the biosynthesis of this key antioxidant enzyme by promoting substitution at the UGA codon."
https://openalex.org/W2004898868,"The molecular mechanisms involved in neuronal/astroglial cell fate decisions during the development of the mammalian central nervous system are poorly understood. Here, we report that PRP19β, a splice variant of mouse PRP19α corresponding to the yeast PRP19 protein, can function as a neuron-astroglial switch during the retinoic acid-primed neural differentiation of P19 cells. The β-variant possesses an additional 19 amino acid residues inframe in the N-terminal region of the α-variant. The forced expression of the α-variant RNA caused the down-regulation of oct-3/4 and nanog mRNA expression during the 12-48 h of the late-early stages of neural differentiation and was sufficient to convert P19 cells into neurons (but not glial cells) when the cells were cultured in aggregated form without retinoic acid. In contrast, the forced expression of the β-variant RNA suppressed neuronal differentiation and conversely stimulated astroglial cell differentiation in retinoic acid-primed P19 cells. Based on yeast two-hybrid screening, cyclophilin A was identified as a specific binding partner of the β-variant. Luciferase reporter assay mediated by the oct-3/4 promoter revealed that cyclophilin A could act as a transcriptional activator and that its activity was suppressed by the β-variant, suggesting that cyclophilin A takes part in the induction of oct-3/4 gene expression, which might lead to neuroectodermal otx2 expression within 12 h of the immediate-early stages of retinoic acid-primed neural differentiation. These results show that the α-variant gene plays a pivotal role in neural differentiation and that the β-variant participates in neuronal/astroglial cell fate decisions.

In mammals, the neural tube consists of a morphologically identical population of neuroepithelial cells from which all the diverse neuronal and glial subtypes of the central nervous system are generated. As neurogenesis begins, proliferating neural progenitors become restricted to the ventricular zone at the inner surface of the neural tube. Stem cells within the ventricular zone cease to produce neurons at around midgestation and instead start to produce glia. What causes these stem cells to switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis is one of the most important issues in neural differentiation. In Drosophila, neuronal and glial fates are determined by the gcm (glial cell missing) gene encoding a transcription factor as a binary switch (1Hosoya T. Takizawa K. Nitta K. Hotta Y. Cell. 1995; 82: 1025-1036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In a gcm mutant, glial cells are converted to neurons, whereas ectopic expression of gcm in neurons causes neuron-glial transformation. Two mammalian gcm homologs, Gcm1 and Gcm2, have been identified in mice, rats, and humans (2Akiyama Y. Hosoya T. Poole A.M. Hotta Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Targeted disruption of the Gcm1 gene in mice results in a severe defect in labyrinth formation in the placenta (8Anson-Cartwright L. Dawson K. Holmyard D. Fisher S.J. Lazzarini R.A. Cross J.C. Nat.

Nonetheless, cultures from Gcm1-deficient mouse brain do not exhibit a significant reduction in the number of astrocytes, suggesting that mouse Gcm1 exhibits the potential to induce gliogenesis, but may function in the generation of a minor subpopulation of glial cells (10Iwasaki Y. Hosoya T. Takebayashi H. Ogawa Y. Hotta Y. Ikenaka K. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 6027-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gcm2-targeted mice exhibit a selective loss of parathyroid glands, but no abnormalities were reported in the nervous system (11Gunther T. Chen Z.F. Kim J. Priemel M. Rueger J.M.

Thus, in mammals, although there is evidence that neurons and glia share a common progenitor (12Kim J. Lo L. Dormand E. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 2003; 38: 17-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), the genes that might control a GCM-like switching mechanism have not yet been identified. Recent studies have shown that the Sox9 transcription factor (13Stolt C.C. Lommes P. Sock E. Chaboissier M.C. Schedl A. Wegner M.

Nevertheless, these limited factors may be insufficient for the regulation of glial cell differentiation because mammalian astrocytes exhibit a large heterogeneity, differing in morphology, distribution, molecular types expressed, function, and cell lineage. In this context, to clarify the molecular mechanisms in neuronal/astroglial fate decisions in mammals, we applied a subtractive cDNA cloning strategy for the retinoic acid (RA)-induced neural differentiation system of mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells as described previously (16Akiyama H. Sugiyama A. Uzawa K. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Tashiro F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). By this approach, we isolated PRP19α (precursor RNA processing-19α) and its splice variant PRP19β, with an additional 19-amino acid residues in-frame. PRP19α and PRP19β are homologs of yeast Prp19, which has been identified in a screen of temperature-sensitive mutants defective in precursor RNA processing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and shown to be essential for pre-mRNA splicing (17Cheng S.C. Tarn W.Y. Tsao T.Y. Abelson J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1876-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is no report concerning the participation of PRP19α and PRP19β in neural differentiation so far. In this study, we show that P19 cells modified to express PRP19α constitutively in large quantities no longer required RA for neuronal differentiation. When these cells were cultured in aggregated form, the mRNA expression of neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, including Mash-1, Ngn-1 (neurogenin-1), and NeuroD, was promoted to sufficient levels for the induction of β-tubulin III-positive neurons, but not glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astroglia, accompanied by the down-regulation of oct-3/4 and nanog mRNA expression. On the other hand, the forced expression of Prp19β RNA suppressed neuronal differentiation through the inhibition of CypA (cyclophilin A), which acts as a transcriptional activator, and inversely promoted glial cell differentiation in RA-primed P19 cells. The down-regulation of Prp19β RNA by the antisense 15-mer oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) specific for the insertional sequence of Prp19β stimulated neuronal differentiation and suppressed astroglial cell differentiation in RA-primed P19 cells. These results imply that the regulation of alternative splicing of the mouse Prp19 gene plays an important role in neuronal and astroglial cell fate decisions. Cell Cultures and Experimental Animals—Mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). To induce neural differentiation, 1 × 106 aggregated P19 cells were cultured in 10-cm bacteriological grade dishes in 10 ml of α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 × 10-7 m all-trans-RA (Sigma) for 4 days as described previously (16Akiyama H. Sugiyama A. Uzawa K. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Tashiro F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cell aggregates were suspended by mild pipetting and transferred to tissue culture dishes. The cells were cultured in RA-free α-minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for an additional 4 days to induce β-tubulin III-positive neurons and for 7 days to induce GFAP-positive astroglial cells. ICR mice were purchased from Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). Culture of Mouse Neural Stem (NS) Cells—NS cells from hippocampi of ICR mice at postnatal day 7 were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture containing 20 ng/ml mouse epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma) as described previously (18Mukobata S. Urano Y. Hibino T. Sugawara T. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. Res. Commun. Biochem. Cell Mol. Biol. 2000; 4: 221-234Google Scholar). To induce neural differentiation, the spheres formed by NS cells were plated onto tissue culture dishes precoated with 20 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and cultured in EGF-free medium containing 20 ng/ml recombinant rat CNTF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 weeks. Subtractive Cloning—Tester poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from aggregated P19 cells treated with 5 × 10-7 m RA for 24 h, and firststrand cDNA was hybridized with excess driver RNA prepared from untreated P19 cells, and then a subtractive cDNA probe was prepared by the addition of the cross-linking agent 2,5-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone and used to screen 9 × 105 plaques of rat brain 5′-stretch plus a λgt11 cDNA library (Clontech) as described previously (16Akiyama H. Sugiyama A. Uzawa K. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Tashiro F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The cDNAs inserted into the positive phage were then amplified by PCR using primers based on the phage DNA sequence: 5′-primer, 5′-GCC ACG ACT CCT GGA GCC CG-3′; and 3′-primer, 5′-CAC CAG ACC AAC TGG TAA TG-3′. The amplified cDNAs were digested with EcoRI and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-7zf(+) (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). A rat full-length Prp19α cDNA clone was isolated from the second screening of 4.5 × 105 plaques from a rat brain λgt10 cDNA library (Clontech) using the 1.1-kb EcoRI cDNA fragment obtained from the first screening as a probe and then subcloned into the EcoRI site of pGEM-7zf(+). The plasmid was designated as pGEM-Prp19α. Primers Used for PCR Amplification—Total RNAs extracted from the spheres of P19 cells and mouse NS cells were reverse-transcribed, and cDNAs were amplified by PCR as described previously (18Mukobata S.

The CypA PCR product was digested with NsiI and inserted into the EcoRI-XhoI site of pACT2 (Clontech) and named pACT2-CypA. Real-time PCR Analysis of PRP19α and PRP19β Expression during Neural Differentiation—To generate cDNA from P19 cell culture samples, 5 μg of total RNAs was reverse-transcribed with random primer. Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Eurogentec, Seraine, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specific primers used were as follows: Prp19α, 5′-ATC AAC AAC CAG CCT CTC TCA GAG-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-TGC AGC ATG ACT GCA TCC C-3′ (3′-primer); and Prp19β, 5′-CAG AGG AGC AGC TCA TCG ACA-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-AGG GTA GGC CAC TGT GAG GAC T-3′ (3′-primer). Fluorescence was detected at the end of each cycle to monitor the amount of PCR product. The quantities of specific mRNA in the sample were measured according to the corresponding gene-specific standard curve. Amplification of specific transcripts was confirmed by a final melting curve profile and gel electrophoresis. The levels of Prp19α and Prp19β transcripts at each time point were calibrated as compared with those of ribosomal phosphoprotein transcripts as an internal control (31Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Aliquots of 20 μg of total RNAs were electrophoresed on 6% formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK), and hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR-amplified probe as described above. Developed x-ray films were scanned into a Macintosh G4, and the expression levels of these RNAs were quantified using the NIH Image 1.62 ppc program. Construction of Expression Vectors—pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19α and pcDNA3-EF1-α-antisense Prp19α expression vectors were constructed by the insertion of the Prp19α cDNA fragment into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3-EF1-α (16Akiyama H. Sugiyama A. Uzawa K. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Tashiro F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 140: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19β expression vector was constructed by the insertion of the ApaI-HindIII fragment of pGEM-Prp19β into the BamHI-HindIII site of pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19α. pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense CypA and pcDNA3-EF1-α-antisense CypA expression vectors were constructed by the insertion of the blunt-ended EcoRI-XhoI CypA fragment of pACT2-CypA into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3-EF1-α. These vectors were introduced into P19 cells by lipofection with N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methyl sulfate (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) for selection. The stable transfectants of the pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19α, pcDNA3-EF1-α-antisense Prp19α, pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19β, pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense CypA, and pcDNA3-EF1-α-antisense CypA vectors were designated as α-S1, α-A1, β-S1, CypA-S1, and CypA-A1 cells, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—Antibodies against PRP19α and PRP19β were prepared using glutathione S-transferase-fused rat PRP19α and synthetic peptides specific for PRP19β (SPALPQSSQWPTLSQ), respectively. Cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Aliquots of 30 μg of cell lysate were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to a clear blot membrane (Atto Bioscience, Tokyo). The membranes were blocked in 20 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.01% Tween 20 containing 1% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-PRP19α antibody (1:500 dilution), anti-PRP19β antibody (1:100), anti-CypA antibody (1:10000; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), anti-β-tubulin III antibody (1:400; Sigma), anti-GFAP antibody (1:400; Sigma), anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) antibody (1:200; Sigma), anti-polypyrimidine tract-binding protein-associated splicing factor (PSF) antibody (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CDC5L (CDC5-like) antibody (1:2000) (32Ajuh P. Kuster B. Panov K. Zomerdijk J.C. Mann M. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6569-6581Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), or anti-actin antibody (1:500; Sigma). After washing three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.01% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with adequate secondary antibodies. Anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; Sigma), anti-guinea pig IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA), anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000; BIOSOURCE), or anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used as a secondary antibody as indicated. Signals were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—P19 cells were cultured in a Lab-Tek II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunocytochemical analysis. The cell samples were incubated in Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% normal rabbit serum for 20 min at 37 °C. The samples were then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with antibody against β-tubulin III (1:400) or GFAP (1:400) under the same conditions described above. After washing with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, the samples were incubated with biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG + IgA + IgM (Nichirei, Tokyo) as a secondary antibody, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Nichirei). Visualization was carried out using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. The samples were counterstained with hematoxylin. Construction of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP)-fused PRP19α and PRP19β Expression Vectors—EGFP-fused PRP19α and PRP19β expression vectors were constructed by insertion of the entire coding regions of PRP19α and PRP19β, respectively, downstream of the EGFP-coding sequence in-frame into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) and designated as pEGFP-PRP19α and pEGFP-PRP19β, respectively. P19 cells were transfected with the pEGFP-PRP19α and pEGFP-PRP19β expression vectors using Lipofectamine PLUS™ (Invitrogen) and cultured in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 for selection. To see the subcellular localization of PRP19α and PRP19β, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. The nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. The cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Axioplan 2, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Specific Down-regulation of Prp19β RNA by Antisense ODNs—The sequence of antisense ODNs used was 5′-TAGGCCACTGTGAGG-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 282-296 of the specific region of mouse Prp19β cDNA; and the sequence of sense ODNs used for the control experiment was 5′-CCTCACAGTGGCCTA-3′. P19 cells were treated with various concentration of ODNs as described previously (33Sugiyama A. Miyagi Y. Komiya Y. Kurabe N. Kitanaka C. Kato N. Nagashima Y. Kuchino Y. Tashiro F. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 1549-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—The hemagglutinin (HA)-fused CypA expression vector was constructed by insertion of the blunt-ended BglII open reading frame fragment of pACT2-CypA into the EcoRV site of pcDNA3-EF1-α. P19 cells (3 × 105) were transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine PLUS™. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of cell lysate proteins were incubated overnight with protein A-Sepharose beads charged with anti-PRP19α or anti-HA antibody at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins or cell lysates were mixed with 3× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was performed as described above with the appropriate antibodies. Gel Filtration of the Spliceosome—P19 cells (1 × 108) were homogenized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The resulting supernatant was applied to a Sepharose 4B column (bed volume of 38.4 ml; Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) and eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Fractions of 0.78 ml were collected and analyzed by Western blotting with the appropriate antibodies as described above. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Mouse Prp19β-specific region cDNA (amino acids 83-101) was inserted into pAS2-1 (Clontech) in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as bait. An RA-treated P19 cell cDNA library was constructed using pACT2. Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (34Akiyama H. Fujisawa N. Tashiro Y. Takanabe N. Sugiyama A. Tashiro F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10752-10762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—P19 cells treated with RA for 0 and 6 h were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min. The nuclear fraction was isolated and sonicated to shear genomic chromatin; clarified by centrifugation; precleared with protein A-Sepharose; and immunoprecipitated with anti-CypA antibody, anti-RARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate). Following immunoprecipitation and immobilization of immunocomplexes, proteinase K digestion was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction. PCR was carried out on the purified DNA using primers to the oct-3/4 promoter region (RAREoct; -412 to +39, 5′-CTA GGA CTC GAG ACG GGT GGG TAA G-3′ (5′-primer) and 5′-CAC CCG GAT CCG GGG GCC TGG-3′ (3′-primer) (35Pikarsky E. Sharir H. Ben-Shushan E. Bergman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1026-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Luciferase Reporter Assay—The PCR-amplified mouse oct-3/4 promoter (-412 to +39) was subcloned into the pTRE2-Luc vector (Clontech). The reporter plasmid was termed pLuc-RAREoct. For each transfection, P19 cells (1 × 105/35-mm dish) were transfected with 1 μg of pLuc-RAREoct and 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expression vector pcDNA3.1/Myc-His/LacZ (Invitrogen) together with a total of 1 μg of pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense CypA, pcDNA3-EF1-α-sense Prp19β, and vacant pcDNA3-EF1-α expression vectors in various combinations using Lipofectamine PLUS™. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were treated with RA for an additional 24 h and lysed with the lysis buffer from the Promega luciferase assay kit, and luciferase activities were determined according to the manufacturer's instructions using a Luminous CT9000D luminometer (DiaIatron, Tokyo). Reporter gene activities were normalized using β-galactosidase activity as an internal control.

https://openalex.org/W2053263337,"Insertion of additional octarepeats into the prion protein gene has been genetically linked to familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease and hence to de novo generation of infectious prions. The pivotal event during prion formation is the conversion of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into the pathogenic conformer PrPSc, which subsequently induces further conversion in an autocatalytic manner. Apparently, an expanded octarepeat domain directs folding of PrP toward the PrPSc conformation and initiates a self-replicating conversion process. Here, based on three main observations, we have provided a model on how altered molecular interactions between wild-type and mutant PrP set the stage for familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease with octarepeat insertions. First, we showed that wild-type octarepeat domains interact in a copper-dependent and reversible manner, a “copper switch.” This interaction becomes irreversible upon domain expansion, possibly reflecting a loss of function. Second, expanded octarepeat domains of increasing length gradually form homogenous globular multimers of 11–21 nm in the absence of copper ions when expressed as soluble glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Third, octarepeat domain expansion causes a gain of function with at least 10 repeats selectively binding PrPSc in a denaturant-resistant complex in the absence of copper ions. Thus, the combination of both a loss and gain of function profoundly influences homomeric interaction behavior of PrP with an expanded octarepeat domain. A multimeric cluster of prion proteins carrying expanded octarepeat domains may therefore capture and incorporate spontaneously arising short-lived PrPSc-like conformers, thereby providing a matrix for their conversion.

Prion diseases are transmissible neurodegenerative diseases that, uniquely, in humans can be of genetic, sporadic, or infectious origin. Cases of the most prevalent human prion disease, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD), 2The abbreviations used are: CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; fCJD, familial CJD; DLS, dynamic light scattering; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NHa, normal non-infected hamster brain; OR, octarepeat; PK, proteinase K; PrP, prion protein; PRNP, prion protein gene; ScHa, scrapie-infected hamster brain; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; BSA, bovine serum albumin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are ∼15% genetic, 85% sporadic, and only <1% linked to infection. In genetic or familial CJD (fCJD), germ line mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP) initiate a neurodegenerative disease that subsequently becomes transmissible (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 2Masters C.L. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Brain. 1981; 104: 535-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). This phenomenon has not been reported for other mammalian prion diseases that are more prevalent and seem to have mostly an infectious origin (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar, 3Kong Q. Surewicz K.A. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Montagna P. Lugaresi E.

Major animal prion diseases include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy of cattle, and chronic wasting disease of American mule deer and elk. Transmissibility between species is limited and regulated by a species barrier that is determined by genetic differences in the PRNP gene and eventually by other genes (4Scott M. Peretz D.

In contrast to the seemingly exclusive occurrence of genetic prion disease in humans, polymorphisms in PRNP are known to occur in many species and to influence prion infection susceptibility (3Kong Q. Surewicz K.A. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. 2nd Ed. Prion Biology and Diseases. 41. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 673-775Google Scholar). The essential molecular component of prions is PrPSc, a pathological conformer of the prion protein that replicates without the need for nucleic acids (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Once initiated, the prion replication mechanism is characterized by the conformational conversion of the cellular (“normal”) isoform of the prion protein (PrPC) into PrPSc, which in turn induces further conversion of PrPC, thus propagating the PrPSc conformation (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5168) Google Scholar). Currently, 55 pathogenic mutations have been identified that cause inherited CJD in humans. Of those, 24 are missense mutations and 27 are insertion mutations consisting of up to 9 additional 24-bp repeats and corresponding to an increase (“expansion”) in the number of octarepeats, of which there are normally four consecutive copies (3Kong Q. Surewicz K.A. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Parchi P. Capellari S. Goldfarb L. Montagna P. Lugaresi E. Piccardo P. Ghetti B. Prusiner S.B. 2nd Ed. Prion Biology and Diseases. 41. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 673-775Google Scholar). Interestingly, the clinical phenotype of fCJD with insertional mutations can mimic that of Huntington disease in the early phases of the disease (6Moore R.C. Xiang F. Monaghan J. Han D. Zhang Z. Edstrom L. Anvret M. Prusiner S.B. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1385-1388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Attempts at rebuilding genetic mutations that cause fCJD in cell or animal models in order to reproduce de novo prion genesis have not been successful so far (7Chiesa R. Piccardo P. Quaglio E. Drisaldi B. Si-Hoe S.L. Takao M. Ghetti B. Harris D.A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7611-7622Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that either unknown factors in the human genetic background or lifespan contribute to genetic prion formation. Prion initiation, meaning de novo generation of infectivity by spontaneous conversion of PrPC to PrPSc without template, and prion propagation, i.e. conversion of PrPC to PrPSc in the presence of PrPSc template, are likely to involve two different molecular mechanisms, both remaining as yet unresolved. Although it has long been possible to maintain prion propagation continuously in animals (8Chandler R.L. Lancet. 1961; 1: 1378-1379Abstract PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and in cell culture (9Race R.E. Fadness L.H. Chesebro B. J. Gen.

Virol. 1988; 62: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), only recently have there been significant advances in reproducing both prion initiation and propagation in vitro (11Legname G. Baskakov I.V.

Cell. 2005; 121: 195-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Elucidating the NMR structure of the recombinant prion protein produced in Escherichia coli has been instrumental in determining the structural effects of disease-linked amino acid changes (13Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 14Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The mature prion protein (residues 23–231) can be divided into an N-terminal (23–120) and a C-terminal domain (121–231) (13Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Whereas the C terminus adopts a mainly α-helical globular conformation, the N terminus is largely disordered (14Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13452-13457Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), although it may adopt a non-random conformation at physiological pH (15Zahn R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The most prevalent missense mutations causing fCJD are localized in the C-terminal domain and clustered at the edges of α-helical structures. However, recombinant PrP carrying disease-linked amino acid substitutions is not thermodynamically destabilized (16Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3258-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), pointing to a disease mechanism more complex than mere misfolding. The N-terminal domain contains four highly conserved copper binding octarepeats (ORs) of the sequence PHGGGWGQ (single letter amino acid code; residues 60–91). These are flanked by one nonarepeat (residues 51–59; PQGGGTWGQ) and one partial repeat (residues 92–98; GGGTHNQ) that could bind copper as well (17Burns C.S. Aronoff-Spencer E. Legname G. Prusiner S.B. Antholine W.E. Gerfen G.J. Peisach J. Millhauser G.L. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6794-6803Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The OR domain binds copper in a cooperative manner at physiological pH and undergoes a distinct conformational change as a result, whereas copper affinity is abolished below pH 6 (18Stöckel J. Safar J. Wallace A.C. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7185-7193Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 19Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of PrP, including the OR domain, is of little importance for prion propagation because removal of the N terminus from PrPSc by partial protease digestion does not significantly alter infectivity titers (20McKinley M.P. Bolton D.C. Prusiner S.B. Cell. 1983; 35: 57-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Likewise, transgenic mice expressing PrP constructs with a deleted OR domain on the PrP knock-out background can still produce infectious prions, albeit with increased incubation times and reduced prion titers when inoculated with full-length prions (21Fischer M.

Swergold G.D. Wills P.R. Cervenakova L. Baron H. Gibbs Jr., C.J. Gajdusek D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10926-10930Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Our goal was to investigate the pathogenesis of fCJD by determining how OR domain expansion, being the result of an insertional mutation, starts the PrP misfolding pathway and ultimately leads to the formation of infectious prions. In a series of biochemical and biophysical experiments, we demonstrated how the OR domain mediates copper-dependent and -independent homomeric interactions between PrP molecules. OR domain expansion changes these properties in such a way that binding between OR domains is no longer fully reversible and binding to PrPSc instead of PrPC is favored. Thus, by preferentially interacting with PrPSc, PrPC with an expanded OR domain may have a higher likelihood of undergoing conversion, thereby facilitating development of fCJD. SyHaPrP-8OR, -10OR, and -16OR fragments were assembled from the following oligonucleotides: 1) phos-5′-GGCTGGGGGCAGCCCCATGGTGGT-3′, 2) phos-5′-CTGCCCCCAGCCACCACCATGGGG-3′, 3) phos-5′-GGATCCGCGCGCGCGC-3′, 4) phos-5′-GGCTGGGGGCAGTGATAAGAATTCGAGAGAGAGA-3′, 5) 5′-GCGCGCGCGCGGATCCCCCCATGGTGGT-3′, and 6) TCTCTCTCTCGAATTCTTATCA. First, we ligated oligonucleotides 2, 3, and 5 (10 μm each in 10 μl) using Taq ligase (New England Biolabs; 45 min, 45 °C). This ligation mix was then diluted 1/50 (mol/mol) in a mix of primers 1 and 2 (20 μm each, in 10 μl), followed by further ligation with Taq ligase (1 h, 40 °C). We then added primers 4 and 6 (250 nmol each) and ligated with T4 ligase (16 h, 16 °C). The resulting mixture was separated on 1.5% Tris borate-EDTA-agarose, and all fragments ≥200 bp were collected. The wild-type SyHaPrP-(23–98) and SyHaPrP-(52–98) fragments were amplified from pET-11a(SyHaPrP-(23–231)). Finally, all OR fragments were cloned into the pGEX-4T-3 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences) at BamHI/EcoRI. All cloned constructs were verified by sequencing on an ABI Prism (PerkinElmer). Free GST (vector only), GST·HD20, GST·HD51, and GST·OR fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(λDE3) according to standard methods. Following lysozyme lysis, the suspension was brought to 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% sarkosyl, cleared (20 min, 20.000 × g), and affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After elution, all proteins were directly treated with iodoacetamide (50 mm, 30 min, room temperature) to block free Cys residues on the GST moiety. The GST·OR fusions were further purified on Zn2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Novagen). All proteins were then extensively dialyzed against 10 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that batches of all GST·OR fusion proteins were consistently purified to homogeneity and migrated at their expected molecular masses (Table 1).TABLE 1Description and measured particle sizes of GST·OR fusion proteinsConstructCalculated molecular massMeasured DH and molecular mass at pH 7.5Measured DH and molecular mass at pH 5.5kDanm/kDanm/kDaGST26.25.4 ± 0.2/34 ± 4GST·SyHaPrP-(23-98) (4OR)33.76.8 ± 0.2/59 ± 4GST·SyHaPrP-(52-98) (4OR)30.76.0 ± 0.2/44 ± 4GST·8OR32.510.6 ± 0.6/170 ± 25GST·10OR34.115.8 ± 0.4/420 ± 307.8 ± 0.3/79 ± 8GST·16OR38.721.2 ± 0.6/840 ± 6010.6 ± 0.6/170 ± 25 Open table in a new tab Coupling to Sepharose—GST, GST·HD20, GST·HD51, and GST·OR proteins were covalently coupled to N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 0.3% sarkosyl, 50 μm EDTA (2 h, room temperature) at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml and a coupling density of 5 mg/ml. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides corresponding to SyHaPrP-(55–67) (1OR) and SyHaPrP-(55–98) (4OR) were synthesized by the Biomedizinisches Forschungszentrum at the University of Düsseldorf. Coupling to Bovine Serum Albumin—1OR and 4OR peptides were linked to succinimidyl-acetylthioacetate (Sigma) and then combined with BSA (Bio-Rad) derivatized with succinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (Molecular Probes) at a 1/10 (mol/mol) ratio in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8, 50 mm hydrazine (2 h, room temperature). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that BSA-1OR/4OR conjugates carried several OR peptides each (data not shown). Capture of PrPC and PrPSc—Normal hamster (NHa) or scrapie-infected hamster (ScHa; 263 K strain) brain homogenates (20% w/v stock in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 KAc, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, 5× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were diluted to 0.5% (NHa) or 1% (ScHa) in binding buffer, pH 7.5 (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% sarkosyl) or binding buffer, pH 5.5 (100 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.3% sarkosyl), both containing 1× protease inhibitors and either 50–200 μm CuSO4/ZnSO4 or 5 mm EDTA, and then cleared (5 min, 10,000 × g). Sepharose beads coated with GST, GST·HD20, GST·HD51, or GST·OR (20 μl) were combined with 0.5 ml of NHa or 1 ml of ScHa extract and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads incubated with NHa extract were washed and then boiled in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Beads incubated with ScHa extract were first split, i.e. half was boiled directly, while the other half was digested with 20 μg/ml PK (Merck) for 1 h at 37 °Cin binding buffer, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA (stopped with 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) prior to boiling. Samples were run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and blots were developed with a PrP monoclonal antibody 3F4 (29Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H.

Removal of PrPC from PrPSc—Sepharose beads coated with GST·16OR (20 μl) were incubated with ScHa extract (buffer, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA) obtained from infected hamsters in the terminal stage (low PrPC/PrPSc ratio) or 42 days after infection (high PrPC/PrPSc ratio). Beads were washed and then eluted with 50 ml of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25–1.5% SDS (10 min, room temperature). After collection of the eluate, beads were washed with a further 1 ml of SDS buffer and then boiled. HaPrP Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—For calibration, a stock solution of 0.5 mg/ml recHaPrP-(23–231) (30Korth C. Streit P. Oesch B. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 106-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) was freshly diluted to 50–0.5 ng/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3, 7 m guanidinium HCl (GuHCl buffer) and coated onto Maxisorp plates (Nunc) overnight at room temperature. After blocking, wells were probed with monoclonal antibody 3F4 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (2 h, room temperature) and then with peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Pierce) in the same buffer (1 h, room temperature). Plates were developed with TMB substrate (Pharmingen; 15 min, room temperature) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Quantification of GST·16OR-bound PrPSc by Sequential Pulldown—1 ml of 1% ScHa extract was sequentially incubated with two batches of 150 μg of Sepharose-linked GST·16OR (overnight, 4 °C). In parallel, we incubated ScHa homogenate (diluted), the pellet thereof (resuspended in 1 ml of binding buffer, pH 7.5), and extract without Sepharose beads. These samples, in parallel with the extract after GST·16OR pulldown, were digested with PK (20 μg/ml, 1 h at 37 °C), after which PrPSc was pelleted (1 h, 120,000 × g) and washed once with 1 ml of 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3. Pellets were then taken up in 200 μl of GuHCl buffer. Following pulldown, beads were washed with binding buffer, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.3, and then PK digested and subsequently extracted with 200 ml of GuHCl buffer. The PrP content of all GuHCl samples was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described above. Purified GST·4OR, GST·10OR, and GST·16OR (3 mg/ml) were fractionated on a HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 ml/min in binding buffer, pH 7.5, plus 5 mm EDTA or in 20 mm NaAc, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.3% sarkosyl using a Biologic LP system (Bio-Rad). Calibration was done using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) standards (Bio-Rad). Fractions were analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), stained overnight with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were performed on a DynaPro-MS/X machine (Protein Solutions). BSA, BSA-1OR, and BSA-4OR were diluted to 30–250 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, supplemented with either 200 μm CuSO4 or 2 mm EDTA. GST and GST·OR fusions were measured at dilutions of 100–1000 μg/ml in 50 mm HEPES, 5 mm EDTA, or in 100 mm NaAc, pH 5.5. GST·OR fusions were deposited on a freshly cleaved mica surface in 5 mm HEPES/MES, pH 7.9/5.5, 3 mm KCl, 5.5 mm MgCl2, air-dried, and analyzed as described (31Leliveld S.R. Dame R.T. Mommaas M.A. Koerten H.K. Wyman C. Danen-van Oorschot A.A. Rohn J.L. Noteborn M.H. Abrahams J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Syrian Gold hamsters (6–8 weeks old) were inoculated intracerebrally using a 24-gauge needle (four or five hamsters each group) with the following material. (A), starting material: 1 ml of 1% ScHa brain extract (263 K) in binding buffer, from which PrPSc was collected by ultracentrifugation (45 min, 100,000 × g in an Optima table ultracentrifuge (BeckmanCoulter)) and subsequently washed twice with 70% ethanol and twice with sterile PBS. (B), beads coated with GST·16OR (see above) that had been incubated overnight in ScHa extract produced as in (A) and then washed three times in binding buffer, twice with 70% ethanol, and twice with sterile PBS. (C), 1 ml 1% ScHa brain extract in binding buffer after pull down with GST·16OR prepared as described in (A). (D), as a negative control, GST·4OR beads were prepared as in (B). (E) As another negative control, GST beads were prepared as for (B). For (B), (D), and (E), we choose to inoculate the whole bead fraction in order to investigate all infectivity captured and to avoid manipulating infectivity by elution procedures. Animals were examined daily for standard neurological symptoms and were sacrificed because of animal protection aspects when severe clinical symptoms were observed. The animal experimentation protocol had been approved to Lothar Stitz. The Wild-type Prion Protein OR Domain Is a Reversible, Copper-dependent Self-association Domain—First, we established the copper-dependent mode of the homomeric interactions between OR domains. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, in which GST was linked N-terminal to SyHaPrP N-terminal fragments with different OR lengths (Table 1) were used to circumvent poor solubility of both wild-type and expanded OR domains when present as free polypeptides or within full-length PrP (data not shown). Because the octarepeat sequences of human and hamster PrP are identical, we considered these constructs to be valid models for investigating biochemical characteristics of the OR domain in human PrP. We covalently coupled GST alone, GST with four ORs (GST·4OR), and GST with sixteen consecutive ORs (GST·16OR) to Sepharose via amine linkage, thus ensuring that only the GST moiety was bound to the solid support. GST·16OR was used as a model protein for expanded OR domains as occurring in fCJD, where the maximum number of ORs reported so far is 14. When incubated with brain extract from normal, non-infected hamsters (NHa) in sarkosyl-containing buffer (0.3%), both the GST·4OR and GST·16OR captured PrPC in the presence of copper ions at pH 7.5 with a half-maximal effect between 75 and 125 μm (Fig. 1A). However, unlike GST·4OR, GST·16OR still retained PrPC even in the absence of copper ions (Fig. 1B), suggesting partial loss of copper-dependent reversibility for PrP binding. Under the conditions used here, the full N-terminal fragment PrP-(23–98) expressed as a fusion protein to GST (GST·SyHaPrP-(23–98)) showed essentially the same effect as GST·4OR (data not shown), demonstrating that the OR domain alone is sufficient for PrPC binding. Experiments performed with zinc yielded the same results as copper over the same concentration range. To establish whether OR domains could interact directly in solution and to analyze the critical OR length needed for such an interaction, we covalently linked synthetic 1OR (residues 55–67) and 4OR (residues 55–98) peptides via amine linkage to BSA and analyzed copper-dependent OR-OR interactions in vitro by DLS. In the absence of copper ions (2 mm EDTA), the hydrodynamic diameters (DH) of BSA alone, BSA-1OR, and BSA-4OR were 7.5 ± 0.4 nm (70 ± 10 kDa), indicating that all three conjugates were essentially monomeric. Adding copper ions (200 μm CuSO4) caused BSA-4OR, but not BSA or BSA-1OR, to associate into large, heterogeneous particles (DH ≥85 nm), indicating binding between BSA-4OR conjugates, each carrying several peptides. These results demonstrated that 4OR, but not 1OR, peptides directly self associate in the presence of copper ions, presumably because of the conformation-inducing effect of copper binding on the OR domain (19Viles J.H. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Goodin D.B. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2042-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). We were unable to determine the effect of copper on the size distribution of GST·OR proteins by DLS as GST itself was no longer monodisperse in the presence of copper, thus prohibiting reliable data collection. The Expanded OR Domain as in fCJD Leads to the Formation of Distinct Multimeric Complexes—When we examined GST·16OR by DLS in the absence of copper ions, we found that it was present as a monodisperse multimeric complex with a DH of 21.2 ± 0.6 nm, corresponding to 850 ± 50 kDa at pH 7.5 (Table 1). Under the same conditions, GST alone and GST·4OR were measured to be essentially monomeric (Table 1). These findings demonstrate that OR domain expansion brings about new homomeric interactions that are copper independent and ordered in nature. Interestingly, GST·OR proteins with intermediate OR lengths also formed particles of intermediate size: GST·8OR and GST·10OR had diameters of 10.6 ± 0.6 nm (160 ± 30 kDa) and 15.8 ± 0.4 nm (420 ± 30 kDa), respectively, demonstrating a gradual effect of OR length on multimerization. Upon lowering the pH to 5.5, multimeric GST·16OR readily dissolved into lower molecular mass complexes with a DH of 10.7 ± 0.6 nm (170 ± 30 kDa). Likewise, GST·10OR multimers converted to monomer- or dimer-like particles (Table 1), confirming that higher order multimerization by the expanded OR domain is a phenomenon that only occurs at physiological pH. Our DLS findings on multimerization of expanded OR domains were confirmed by scanning force microscopy and SEC (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Scanning force microscopy analysis demonstrated that, compared with GST·4OR, all (detergent-free) GST·10OR and GST·16OR multimers appeared as essentially homogenous, spherical particles and not as, for instance, fibrillar species (Fig. 2A). Indeed, purified GST·16OR did not bind thioflavin T, indicating that these multimers were not amyloid like (data not shown). Quantitative analysis of scanning force microscopy images showed that GST"

Although the majority of D12 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments at steady state, overexpression or knockdown of D12 had no obvious effects on membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway. However, suppression of D12 expression caused rapid appearance of lipofuscin granules, accompanied by apoptotic cell death without the apparent activation of the unfolded protein response. The typical cause of lipofuscin formation is the impaired degradation of mitochondria by lysosomal degradative enzymes, and, consistent with this, we found that proper post-Golgi maturation of cathepsin D was impaired in D12-deficient cells. This unexpected observation was supported by evidence that D12 associates with VAMP7, a SNARE in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway.

Specific fusion of biological membranes is required for many cellular processes, including membrane trafficking between different organelles and within individual organelles, and is executed in eukaryotic cells by fusogenic soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) 3The abbreviations used are: NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERGIC, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment(s); NLS, nuclear localization signal; UPR, unfolded protein response; SNAP, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; FL-REX, fluorescence localization-based retrovirus-mediated expression cloning; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. attachment protein (SNAP) receptors (SNAREs) (1.Blumenthal R. Clague M.J. Durell S.R. Epand R.M. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). SNAREs are a group of membrane proteins that localize to and function in the diverse endomembrane system, where docking and fusion between membranes take place. All SNAREs are characterized by homologous stretches of 60-70 amino acids referred to as SNARE motifs, which are adjacent to the membrane anchor domains. SNAREs can be classified into subgroups: the syntaxin and SNAP-25 families contain a conserved glutamine at a central position called the “0” layer of the SNARE motif and are therefore called Q-SNAREs, and the VAMP (also called synaptobrevin) family contains a conserved arginine at this position and are therefore called R-SNAREs (2.Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). SNARE motifs contribute to the formation of an extended parallel four-helix bundle, termed the SNARE core complex (3.Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Assembly of the SNARE core complex first leads to a tight connection between two membranes and then drives lipid mixing and subsequent opening of a fusion pore (4.McNew J.A. Weber T. Parlati F.

Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Although SNARE complexes are the critical machinery of membrane fusion, their role in determining the specific sites of fusion within the endomembrane system remains to be established. The early secretory pathway, which comprises the ER, the Golgi apparatus, and the intermediate compartments, is highly dynamic and tightly regulated. Cargo proteins are efficiently exported from the ER, and the constituents of the ER are retrieved by retrograde transport from the Golgi. In yeast, a variety of SNAREs or SNARE-related proteins have been implicated in the processes of retrograde (Ufe1p, Sec22p, Sec20p, and Tip20p) and anterograde (Sed5p, Sec22p, Bos1p, and Bet1p) transport (6.Pelham H.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Recently, Use1p/Slt1p was identified as a novel SNARE located in the ER. This is an essential protein and is thought to function in retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, because Use1p/Slt1p is associated with the retrograde SNAREs Ufe1p, Sec22p, and Sec20p but not with the anterograde SNAREs Bos1p and Bet1p (7.Dilcher M.

However, it was also shown that Use1p/Slt1p interacts with the farnesylated SNARE Ykt6p (8.Burri L. Varlamov O. Doege C.A. Hofmann K. Beilharz T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9873-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Because Ykt6p has been implicated in multiple intracellular transport pathways, particularly in homotypic fusion with vacuoles, an alternative possibility involving the later secretory pathway cannot be excluded. Recently, the mammalian homologues of yeast genes have been identified, including syntaxin 18, Sec22b, syntaxin 5, membrin, and rbet1, which in yeast correspond to Ufe1p, Sec22p, Sed5p, Bos1p, and Bet1p, respectively (9.Bennett M.K.

More recently, BNIP1 and p31, which have similarity to Sec20p and Use1p/Slt1p in yeast, were identified as syntaxin 18-associated proteins. BNIP1 forms a SNARE complex with syntaxin 18, Sec22b, and p31 and participates in the formation of the ER network structure (16.Nakajima K. Hirose H. Taniguchi M. Kurashina H. Arasaki K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3216-3226Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interestingly, BNIP1 appears to be involved in an apoptosis pathway through the regulation of α-SNAP function (16.Nakajima K. Hirose H. Taniguchi M. Kurashina H. Arasaki K. Nagahama M. Tani K.

We show here that D12 is a Q-SNARE and, whereas it is mostly localized in the ER and ERGIC, it also binds to VAMP7, a SNARE involved in endosome-lysosome transport. Our analyses indicate that D12 plays no role in membrane trafficking in the early secretory pathway but rather is involved in the maintenance of proper lysosomal function. Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. PLAT-E cells, a packaging cell line (18.Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum containing blasticidin S (10 μg/ml) and puromycin (1 μg/ml). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method with Cell Phect (Amersham Biosciences) or by the lipofection method using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For retrovirus-mediated gene expression, NIH3T3 cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses produced by PLAT-E packaging cells as previously described (19.Sasaki A. Inagaki-Ohara K. Yoshida T.

Modified FL-REX to Search for Proteins in the Secretory Pathway—The murine hematopoietic stem cell cDNA was described previously (20.Masuhara M. Sakamoto H. Matsumoto A. Suzuki R. Yasukawa H. Mitsui K. Wakioka T. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Misawa H. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Yoshimura A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The 3′ region of the cDNA was deleted by ExoIII digestion and inserted into a pMX vector containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) sequence followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and an ER retention signal (KDEL) (pMX-cDNA-EGFP-NLS-KDEL). In detail, three tandem repeats of the NLS from the SV virus large T-antigen were excised from pECFP-Nuc (BD Biosciences), and the EGFP coding sequence was excised from pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Twenty-four pooled plasmid DNA clones were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells in a 96-well dish using the standard calcium phosphate method and were examined with immunofluorescence microscopy. The cDNA pool that gave ER- or cytosolic localization of EGFP was divided into individual clones, and HEK293 cells were similarly screened for independent clones. Positive clones were isolated, and the inserted cDNAs were examined by genomic sequencing. Expression of Proteins and Imaging Analyses—The full-length cDNA of mouse D12 was obtained by PCR using the MC9 cDNA library as a template. Full-length or C-terminal-deleted mutant D12 (D12Δtm) were subcloned into the multicloning site of the pMX (21.Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) and pCMV10 (Sigma) vectors. Expression vectors for mRFP1-tagged full-length D12 or the first 80 amino acids of D12 (D12-(1-80)) were also constructed by inserting the open reading frame into appropriate sites of pmRFP1-N1, in which the EGFP open reading frame of pEGFP-N1 (BD Biosciences) was replaced with the mRFP1 open reading frame (22.Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). These plasmids were introduced into cells using either FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science) or bead loading (fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis) (23.Nagaya H. Wada I. Jia Y.J. Kanoh H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin for 1 min on ice or fixed and permeabilized with methanol at -20 °C essentially as described (24.Kamada A. Nagaya H. Tamura T. Kinjo M. Jin H.Y. Yamashita T. Jimbow K. Kanoh H. Wada I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21533-21542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After staining, the specimens were observed with confocal microscopy using an LSM PASCAL or LSM510metaConfoCor2 (Carl Zeiss). For counting the number of cells with a condensed nucleus, cells were stained with Hoechst33342 (1 μg/ml) and observed on an epifluorescence microscope, Eclips TE2000-U (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), with a filter set for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The images were taken using cooled CCD Cascade 512B (Photometrics) and processed with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). The diffusion time of D12-(1-80)-mRFP1 in living cells was estimated by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy as described previously (24.Kamada A. Nagaya H. Tamura T. Kinjo M. Jin H.Y.

Antibodies—The antibodies used in this study were α-FLAG M2 (Sigma), α-GM130 (BD Bioscience), α-phospho-Ser51-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology), α-eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology), α-PERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), α-ATF6 (IMGENEX), α-XBP-1 (Santa Cruz), α-HSP70 (Stressgen), α-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), α-active BAX (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and α-GAPDH (Ambion). Antibodies against D12, Sec22b, syntaxin 5, syntaxin 18, calnexin, ERGIC53, and GRP78 were obtained by immunizing rabbits with the bacterially expressed GST fusion of each protein with the transmembrane domain deleted. Identification of D12-binding Proteins—For the proteomic screening of D12 binding proteins, 2.4 × 108 293T cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the transmembrane domain-deleted D12 (pCMV10-D12Δtm) using calcium phosphate precipitation. Fortyeight hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Nacalai; Japan)). The lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) at 4 °C for 12 h. The resins were washed five times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl) and eluted with 3×FLAG peptide (Sigma). The protein sample was concentrated and lysed with SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 280 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 10% gel, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. The major bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin, and the eluted peptides were loaded on liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (FINNIGAN LC Q DECA; Finnigan). The spectrophotometry data were searched for known proteins using Sequest software (25.Saeki K. Miura Y. Aki D. Kurosaki T. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation of NIH3T3 Cells—NIH3T3 cells cultured in two 100-mm plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper in 0.6 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose) and homogenized by passage 10 times through a 27-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. Unbroken cells and nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 1,200 × g for 5 min. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on preformed Nycodenz (Sigma) gradients, which were prepared for the HITACHI S52ST rotor from initial discontinuous gradients (24, 19, 15, and 10% Nycodenz in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 3 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) that were allowed to diffuse in a horizontal position for 45 min at room temperature and then centrifuged for 4 h at 37,000 rpm in a Himac CS100GXL (Hitachi) ultracentrifuge to generate a nonlinear density gradient profile. The postnuclear supernatant was loaded on top of the gradient and centrifuged for 4 h at 37,000 rpm. Fourteen fractions were collected from the top, and the proteins in aliquots of the fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The distribution of D12, syntaxin 18, Sec22b, GM130 (Golgi marker), ERGIC53 (ERGIC marker), and calnexin (ER marker) in the gradients was determined by immunoblotting using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). For fractionation using Percoll, NIH3T3 cells grown in a 100-mm dish were harvested and homogenized in homogenization buffer (5 mm HEPES/KOH, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.2) by passage 10 times through a 27-gauge needle on a 1-ml syringe. After centrifugation (1,200 × g, 10 min) to remove cell debris and nuclei, the postnuclear supernatant was combined with 90% Percoll solution containing 250 mm sucrose and 5 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, so that the final concentration of Percoll was 17%. This mixture was layered over a 2.5 m sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 75 min in a S52ST rotor (Hitachi) at 4 °C. Gradients were fractionated from the top into 16 fractions, and the proteins in aliquots of the fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The distributions of cathepsin D, D12, and Sec22b in the gradients were analyzed by immunoblotting using ECL. Down-regulation of D12 Protein Expression by RNA Interference—The RNA duplexes used for targeting were mouse D12 siRNA1 (5′-CCUGAAAGUUCAAGCAAGUAAACCGAG-3′), D12 siRNA2 (5′-CCCAGAGUGUCAUCAAGAAGGACAAAG-3′), ERp72 siRNA (5′-GGAAUCGUUGAUUACAUGAUC), VIPL siRNA (5′-GUCAAACGUUCGAGUACUUGA), and control siRNA (5′-AAUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGACUU) (RNAi Co.). Transfection into NIH3T3 and HEK293 cells was performed using X-treme (Roche Applied Science) for NIH-3T3 cells or Lipofectamin 2000 (Invitrogen) for HEK293 cells according to the manufacturers' protocols. At 24-48 h after transfection, the cells were processed for immunoblotting or immunofluorescence assays. Identification of D12 Using an FL-REX Method Modified for Signal Sequence Trapping—The FL-REX method (fluorescence localization-based retrovirus-mediated expression cloning) (17.Misawa K. Nosaka T. Morita S. Kaneko A. Nakahata T. Asano S. Kitamura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3062-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) was developed to clone cDNAs based on the cellular localization of cDNAs from an EGFP-fused cDNA library. To search for novel secreted or membrane-bound proteins, we modified the FL-REX method to include a signal sequence trap. To facilitate identification of proteins actively retained in the cytoplasmic compartment, we added two targeting signals, a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a C-terminal ER retention signal (KDEL). When this EGFP-NLS-KDEL vector alone was expressed in cultured cells, it was confined to the nucleus. Hence, simply by examining the intracellular localization of expressed proteins with epifluorescence microscopy, this method should permit the identification of genes containing either a signal sequence or a membrane-anchoring domain. In addition, this should allow the identification of proteins with an affinity for extranuclear structures. We screened a total of 9000 clones of a murine hematopoietic stem cell cDNA library and observed several clones expressing the EGFP signal in the ER. These included SEP15 (a 15-kDa selenoprotein) (26.Korotkov K.V. Kumaraswamy E. Zhou Y. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15330-15336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and KDAP (kidney-derived aspartic protease-like protein, Napsin) (27.Mori K. Shimizu H. Konno A. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 2002; 65: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), both of which contain signal sequences. We also obtained clones encoding the cytoplasmic proteins Gng10 (guanine nucleotide binding protein γ 10), whose signal was mostly in the cytosol, and SAP18 (Sin3-associated polypeptide), whose signal was found in the ER (data not shown). Interestingly, we found a clone whose signal was partially expressed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). Because this clone encoded the first 80 amino acids of a protein of unknown function, D12, we focused on its characterization. To identify this protein, we isolated the full-length clone of D12 from the cDNA library of a murine mast cell-derived cell line, MC9. Characterization of D12—D12 was originally identified from a cDNA library of mouse cultured bone marrow mast cells (GenBank™ accession number AF353245). According to the report, this is a 270-amino acid protein with two domains predicted to form coiled-coils, including two putative coiled-coil heptads in regions 13-39 and 206-243 identified with a 28-residue window width (28.Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (region 241-263) (Fig. 1B). When we sequenced the full-length D12 isolated from the MC9 cDNA library, we noticed the presence of a Ser after Ala153 due to the insertion of CAG after Cys469 in AF353245. The same insertion was observed in some cDNAs in the EST data base (BU841695 or BQ287737), whereas others (CB204034 or BY708461) had no such insertion. For alignment (Fig. 1C, see below), we used the sequence we obtained experimentally from the clone in the MC9 library, and we refer to this sequence, which contains the Ser insertion after Ala153, as D12. Using the SMART data base (available on the World Wide Web at smart.embl-heidelberg.de/), we predicted two regions with weak similarity to the syntaxin N-terminal domain (residues 64-189) and the t-SNARE motif (residues 166-237) (Fig. 1B). Mouse D12 shows a low level of homology to yeast Use1p/Slt1p (20.1% identity) and a high level of homology to the human uncharacterized protein MDS032 (GenBank™ accession number AF220052), except in its N-terminal extension of 11 amino acids and an internal region (residues 139-164) (overall identity 84.9%; Fig. 1B). D12-(1-80), which we initially identified by modified FL-REX, contains the first coiled-coil but no obvious hydrophobic signal sequence. To confirm that the observed weak cytoplasmic localization indicates the presence of a positive retention signal in extranuclear structures, we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to analyze whether the diffusional mobility of the fragment in the cytoplasm is restricted. We constructed D12-(1-80) tagged with a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP1) at its N terminus (mRFP-D12-(1-80)) and expressed the construct in NIH3T3 cells. The intracellular localization was indistinguishable from that of the original EGFP fusion. When the diffusion time of mRFP-D12-(1-80) expressed in the cytoplasm was compared with that of mRFP using the one-component diffusion model, mRFP-D12-(1-80) showed 3-5-fold slower diffusion (data not shown), confirming that the cytoplasmic retention of the N-terminal fragment was actively maintained. Subcellular Localization of D12—Use1p/Slt1p was recently identified as a SNARE that functions in retrograde protein transport from the Golgi to ER in yeast (7.Dilcher M. Veith B. Chidambaram S. Hartmann E. Schmitt H.D. Fischer von Mollard G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3664-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8.Burri L. Varlamov O. Doege C.A. Hofmann K. Beilharz T. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Lithgow T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9873-9877Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that mouse D12 may also function as a SNARE between the ER and Golgi. As a first step to investigate the subcellular distribution of D12 in NIH3T3 cells, a polyclonal D12 antibody was raised against the bacterially expressed protein lacking the transmembrane domain (GST-D12Δtm). The postnuclear supernatant of NIH3T3 cells was separated by Nycodenz gradient centrifugation, and each fraction was subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies against either D12 or the specific marker proteins of the ER (calnexin), ERGIC (ERGIC53/p58), and Golgi (GM130). As shown in Fig. 1C, calnexin was enriched in fractions 1-6, and GM130 in fractions 7-11. ERGIC53/p58, a protein that cycles between the ER, ERGIC, and Golgi, appeared to be enriched in fractions 7 and 8. Distribution of endogenous D12 was similar to that of calnexin. In contrast, more than one-third of syntaxin 18 was recovered in the lighter fractions. Enrichment in the lighter fractions was also observed for Sec22b, which is known to associate with the vesicular structures of ERGIC (29.Zhang T. Wong S.H. Tang B.L. Xu Y. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 435-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because we were unable to obtain high quality immunofluorescence images of endogenous D12 using our antibody, we elected to analyze the localization by another method. When Percoll gradient fractionation was used to separate dense vesicles, mature lysosomes (as indicated by cathepsin D) were well separated from the ER-Golgi-related vesicles (Sec22b) (Fig. 1D). However, D12 appeared to be absent in lysosomes, suggesting that the D12 protein is mostly located in the early secretory pathway that includes the ER and ERGIC. D12 Is a Novel SNARE Protein—To obtain information regarding the function of D12 in cells, we attempted to identify D12-binding proteins using immunoprecipitation and proteomics. A lysate of 2.4 × 108 293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged D12Δtm was used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel. The eluate with the FLAG peptide was resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A), and the major bands were excised from the gel to determine their amino acid sequences by in-gel tryptic digestion followed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. As shown in Fig. 2A, D12-bound proteins appeared to be classified into two groups, the ER chaperones, including calnexin and GRP78/BiP, and the ER-Golgi membrane trafficking proteins, including NSF, α-SNAP, SNAP-29, syntaxin 18, and ZW10. The specific binding between D12 and calnexin, however, was not confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-calnexin antibody in small scale immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown), indicating that the binding of calnexin and GRP78/BiP to D12 in the large scale experiment may be artifacts caused by their protein-mediated chaperone function (30.Ihara Y. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Saito Y. Williams D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). ZW10 is a spindle checkpoint protein associated with kinetochores and has also recently been reported to be a syntaxin 18-binding protein involved in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi (31.Hirose H. Arasaki K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tohyama M. Tagaya M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1267-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This binding profile as well as the sequence homology of D12 to Use1p/Slt1p prompted us to examine the possibility that D12 is a novel SNARE. We prepared detergent extracts of 293T cells co-expressing FLAG-D12 with N-terminally EGFP-tagged α-SNAP (EGFP-α-SNAP) and immunoprecipitated the FLAG-D12 using an anti-FLAG antibody. We used FLAG-syntaxin 18 and FLAG-p47 (32.Hatsuzawa K. Hirose H. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Scheller R.H. Tagaya M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13713-13720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33.Nagahama M. Suzuki M. Hamada Y. Hatsuzawa K. Tani K. Yamamoto A. Tagaya M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) as positive and negative controls, respectively. The immunoblots revealed that EGFP-α-SNAP co-precipitated with FLAG-D12 as well as with FLAG-syntaxin 18 but not with FLAG-p47 (Fig. 2B). In addition, even FLAG-D12Δtm lacking the transmembrane domain co-precipitated with EGFP-α-SNAP. It has been reported that the yeast D12 homologue Use1p/Slt1p interacts with ER-located SNAREs, such as Ufe1p and Sec22p (7.Di"

In vertebrates they display hexacoordinate heme iron atoms and are typically expressed at low levels (μm). Their function is still a matter of debate. In invertebrates they have a hexa- or pentacoordinate heme iron, are mostly expressed at high levels (mm), and have been suggested to have a myoglobin-like function. The native Hb of the surf clam, Spisula solidissima, composed of 162 amino acids, does not show specific deviations from the globin templates.

Kinetic and equilibrium measurements show a moderate oxygen affinity (P50 ∼0.6 torr) and no cooperativity. The histidine binding affinity is 100-fold lower than in neuroglobin. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates a clustering of the S. solidissima nerve Hb with mollusc Hbs and myoglobins, but not with the vertebrate neuroglobins. We conclude that invertebrate nerve Hbs expressed at high levels are, despite the hexacoordinate nature of their heme iron, not essentially different from other intracellular Hbs.

Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) has created much interest in unraveling the cellular functions and potential biomedical implications of these oxygen binding molecules in the metabolism of the vertebrate nervous system (2Hankeln T.

Historically, however, “nerve hemoglobins” (nHbs) 4The abbreviations used are: nHb, invertebrate nerve hemoglobin; Mb, myoglobin; Ngb, neuroglobin; Cygb, cytoglobin; HS, high spin; RR, resonance raman; RT, reverse transcription; P50, oxygen pressure at which half saturation of the hemoglobin is obtained. were first observed in invertebrate taxa. In 1872, Lankester had already recorded the brilliant red color of the ganglia of the polychaete annelid Aphrodite aculeata (3Lankester E.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1872; 21: 70-81Google Scholar). Since then, nHbs have also been found in, or associated with, nerve tissues of several other invertebrate taxa, such as molluscs, arthropods, nemerteans, and nematode species (4Wittenberg J.B. Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology.in: Mangum C.P. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg1992: 59-85Google Scholar, 5Weber R.E. Vinogradov S.N. Physiol.

Colacino J.M. Riggs A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; : 16998-17011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have been characterized at the molecular level. With few exceptions (e.g. in air-breathing gastropods), the invertebrate nHbs are expressed at high concentrations (in the mm range) and have therefore been suggested to support nerve function by mediating O2 storage and/or transport during temporary hypoxia (4Wittenberg J.B. Advances in Comparative and Environmental Physiology.in: Mangum C.P. Springer-Verlag Berlin, Heidelberg1992: 59-85Google Scholar). For example, in the gastropod mollusc Aplysia depilans, the oxygenation state of the nHb was correlated with the electrical activity of the neural ganglia, and firing was shown to be proportional to the degree of oxygenation of the globin (8Chalazonitis N. Gola M. Arvanitaki A. C. R. Seances Soc. Biol. Fil. 1966; 160: 1020-1023PubMed Google Scholar). The nHb in the nerve bundles of the bivalve mollusc Tellina alternata was reported to extend the time of O2 delivery to the nerves during anoxic periods by as much as 30 min, whereas this effect was not demonstrable in the nerves of a related clam species Tagelius plebeius, which lack the nHb (9Kraus D.W. Colacino J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In many cases, the nHbs appear to be specifically expressed in the glial cells surrounding neurons, as reported for the clams T. alternata and Spisula solidissima (10Kraus D.W. Doeller J.E. Smith P.R. Biol. Bull. 1988; 174: 54-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the water-dwelling gastropods Lymnaea stagnalis and Planorbis corneus (11Schindelmeiser I. Kuhlmann D. Nolte A. Comp. Biochem.

The physiological implications of this cell type-specific expression are unclear. With P50 values between 1.1 and 4 torr (12Wittenberg B.A. Briehl R.W. Wittenberg J.B. Biochem. J. 1965; 96: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the oxygen affinities of nHbs are moderate and quite similar to those of vertebrate myoglobins (Mbs), in agreement with the proposed oxygen supply function. However, spectral analyses revealed two different types of nHbs based on the coordination at the heme iron. The nHbs of Aplysia spec., A. aculeata and C. lacteus are pentacoordinate, like vertebrate hemoglobins (Hbs) and Mbs, whereas those of the bivalves T. alternata and S. solidissima are hexacoordinate and exhibit a cytochrome b-type absorption spectrum (9Kraus D.W. Colacino J.M. Science. 1986; 232: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Strittmatter P. Burch H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In hexacoordination, an internal protein ligand (mostly the distal E7 histidine residue) occupies the sixth coordinating position of the heme iron and has to be displaced before an external gaseous ligand can be bound. This results in complex ligand binding kinetics, of which the functional implications still have to be revealed (15Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C.

Hamdane D. Baudin-Creuza V. Marden M. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Several of these features (e.g. hexacoordination, moderate oxygen affinity) of invertebrate nHbs are shared with the neuroglobins (Ngb), which have been identified in many vertebrate taxa, including mammals, birds, amphibians, and fishes (17Burmester T. Haberkamp M. Mitz S. Roesner A. Schmidt M. Ebner B. Gerlach F. Fuchs C. Hankeln T. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ngb is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system, the retina, and in endocrine tissue, but it is specifically found in neurons and not in astrocytes or other glial cells (18Reuss S.

Lett. 2004; 362: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to most nHbs, Ngb is expressed at lower concentrations (μm) in the vertebrate brain, whereas it is more strongly expressed in the neuronal retina (20Schmidt M. Giessl A. Laufs T. Hankeln T. Wolfrum U. Burmester T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1932-1935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Ngb also displays a bis-His-Fe hexacoordinate heme structure (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 23Pesce A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 44417-44426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Ngb is thought to protect neurons against hypoxic damage in vitro and against ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo (26Sun Y. Jin K. Mao X.O. Zhu Y. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15306-15311Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 27Sun Y. Jin K. Peel A. Mao X.O. Xie L. Greenberg D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). However, its function is unclear, and several putative physiological roles of Ngb are still discussed (2Hankeln T. Ebner B. Fuchs C. Gerlach F. Haberkamp M. Laufs T.L. Roesner A. Schmidt M. Weich B. Wystub S. Saaler-Reinhardt S. Reuss S. Bolognesi M. de Sanctis D. Marden M.C. Kiger L. Moens L. Dewilde S. Nevo E. Avivi A. Weber R.E. Fago A. Burmester T. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2005; 99: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). For further understanding of both vertebrate Ngb and invertebrate nHb functions, we have aimed at the molecular characterization of the nHb of the Atlantic surf clam S. solidissima (14Strittmatter P. Burch H.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 78: 562-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Kraus D.W. Doeller J.E. Biol. Bull. 1988; 174: 346-354Crossref Google Scholar, 29Doeller J.E. Kraus D.W. Biol. Bull. 1988; 174: 67-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein is an example of a hexacoordinate nHb, which is abundantly expressed in glial cells and lends the nerves of this organism a bright red appearance. Animals—S. solidissima (Mollusca, Bivalvia) were obtained from the Aquatic Resources Division, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA. Nerve cords and foot and contractor muscle were dissected, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Determination of the Partial Amino Acid Sequence of S. solidissima nHb—Nerves were thawed and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing the Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and centrifuged 10 min at 10,000 rpm; the red supernatant was saved. The nHb was precipitated by differential ammonium sulfate precipitation at 40 and 90% saturation, respectively. Desalted samples were made up to 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 1% 2-mercapto-ethanol and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and separated by reversed phase chromatography on a Vydac C4 column (4.1 mm × 25 cm) using a gradient 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.5% CH3CN to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 75% CH3CN in 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The nHb-containing fractions were vacuum dried and digested with trypsin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/50. The resulting peptides were separated on a Vydac C18 column (2.1 mm × 25 cm; flow rate, 200 μl/min) using the same gradient as for globin purification. Purified peptides were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using an ABI Prosice protein sequencer operated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Peptide sequences were aligned using the primary structure of sperm whale Mb and A. aculeata nHb as templates. cDNA Library Construction—Freshly dissected nerve cords of S. solidissima were immediately submerged and stored in RNAlater RNA stabilization reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 4 °C. RNA extraction was performed on 40 nerve cords using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from ∼100 μg of total RNA according to the protocol of the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). ∼0.5 μg of poly(A)+ mRNA was employed for cDNA synthesis using the ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and Sephacryl S-500 spin columns (Stratagene) for size fractionation. The resulting double-stranded XhoI-EcoRI cDNA fractions were ligated to 1 μg of ZAP Express vector each. Packaging of the directionally cloned cDNA library was performed using the Gigapack III Gold extract (Stratagene). The resulting phage library, consisting of 105 clones, was amplified prior to the isolation of globin gene cDNA sequences by vector-anchored PCR (see below). S. solidissima nHb cDNA Sequence—Degenerated primers were designed based on the partial sequence obtained at the protein level. S. solidissima total RNA was prepared using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and Superscript RT enzyme from Invitrogen. Primer SpiF1 (5′-AARCARGAYTGGAARACN) is a 20-mer with 64-fold redundancy, corresponding to the sense strand predicted by the peptide fragment KQDWKTI. Primer SpiR1 (5′-GTYTGCATRTGNCCNCCDAT) is a 20-mer with 192-fold redundancy, corresponding to the antisense strand predicted by the peptide fragment IGGHMQ. PCR was carried out for 5 min at 94 °C (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C) for 35 cycles and 10 min at 72 °C. The amplified product was purified and sequenced. Based on this sequence a 5′-RACE was carried out using the 5′ Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends system for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). The 3′-end of the S. solidissima globin cDNA was obtained from the amplified phage cDNA library by a PCR approach using the vector-specific oligonucleotide primer T3 and the gene-specific forward (5′-GATGCCGTCGCTAACAGTTG-3′) primer. Globin gene-specific primers were designed according to the partial cDNA obtained by RT-PCR and RACE. PCR amplicons were either sequenced directly or after cloning into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) on both strands by DyeTerminator cycle sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencing reactions were loaded on an Applied Biosystems Prism 3730 capillary sequencer (GENterprise, Mainz, Germany). Sequences were further analyzed using Lasergene programs (DNAstar Inc.). Isolation and Sequencing of the S. solidissima nHb Gene Region— Genomic DNA of S. solidissima foot and contractor muscle of several animals was prepared by the protocol of Schmidt et al. (30Schmidt E.R. Vistorin G. Keyl H.G. Chromosoma. 1980; 76: 35-45Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Sets of primer pairs were designed according to the complete nHb cDNA, and overlapping genomic fragments were amplified. Sequences were obtained as described above. Expression of the Complete Coding Sequence of the nHb of S. solidissima in Escherichia coli—Recombinant S. solidissima nHb were expressed as described (15Dewilde S. Kiger L. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Baudin-Creuza V. Aerts T. Marden M.C. Caubergs R. Moens L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38949-38955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In short, the cDNA of the nHb was cloned into the expression vector pET3a. After expression in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, the S. solidissima nHb was purified to homogeneity by using: (i) ammonium sulfate precipitation (40–90% saturation) for which the 90% pellet was dissolved and dialyzed against 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, (ii) a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column (step elution in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl), and (iii) a Sephacryl S200 gel filtration column in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The globin fractions were pooled and concentrated. Mass Spectrometry of Native and Recombinant S. solidissima nHb— S. solidissima nHb in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, was analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The native or recombinant sample at 5 mm concentration was dissolved in 50:50 methanol:water in 5% formic acid and injected into custom-made nanoelectrospray needles. Nano-electrospray mass spectra were acquired on a Q-TOFII (Micromass, Wythwnshave, UK) over the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range 700–2000. The multiply charged electrospray spectra were deconvoluted by MaxEnt1 software to produce the molecular mass of the protein. Before each measurement, the mass scale was calibrated with myoglobin. Phosphoprotein Staining—Native and recombinant S. solidissima nHb were analyzed by standard SDS-PAGE (15%) and native gel electrophoresis. Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel staining (Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) was performed as described by the manufacturer. As positive controls for phosphorylated proteins, ovalbumin and the peppermint marker (supplied with the staining kit) were used. Negative controls were Mb and bovine serum albumin. Optical and Resonance Raman Spectra—Optical measurements were done with a Cary-5 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. All optical spectra were measured in a range from 350 to 700 nm. Resonance-Raman (RR) measurements were carried out on an 80-cm Dilor XY-800 Raman scattering spectrometer consisting of a triple spectrograph operating in normal mode and a liquid nitrogen-cooled CCD detector. The excitation source was a Kr-ion laser (Spectra Physics 2020) at 413.1 nm. The protein solution was stirred at 6,000 rpm to avoid local heating. Five spectra (120-s recording time) were acquired and averaged after the removal of cosmic ray spikes by a program developed in-house. Laser powers of 2 and 17 milliwatts were used. Sample Preparation—The CO form of the sample was prepared by adding an excess of sodium dithionite and subsequently passing the sample through a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with CO-flushed Tris-HCl buffer (5 mm, pH 8.5). The deoxyferrous form was obtained by equilibration under nitrogen and by adding an excess of sodium dithionite. The concentration of the protein samples used for optical and RR measurements was typically ∼60 μm in Tris-HCl buffer (5 mm, pH 8.5). Kinetic and Equilibrium Measurements of Ligand Binding to Native and Recombinant S. solidissima nHb—Oxygen affinity and cooperativity of recombinant nHb were measured in 0.1 m Tris buffer, 0.5 mm EDTA, at pH 7.5 and 20 °C using a thin-layer gas diffusion chamber as previously described (25Fago A. Hundahl C. Dewilde S. Gilany K. Moens L. Weber R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44417-44426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4-μl samples were allowed to equilibrate with various O2/N2 gas mixtures, while the absorbance at 428 nm was continuously monitored using a UV-VIS Cary 50 Probe spectrophotometer equipped with optic fibers. pH was measured in 100-μl subsamples using a BMS 2 MK 2 thermostated microelectrode (Radiometer). Values for O2 affinity (P50, O2 tension at half-saturation) and cooperativity (n50) were interpolated from the zero-intercept and the slope, respectively, of Hill plots, log[Y/(1–Y)] versus logPO2, where Y is the O2 saturation. Ligand recombination kinetics were measured by flash photolysis as previously described (31Uzan J. Dewilde S. Burmester T. Hankeln T. Moens L. Hamdane D. Marden M.C. Kiger L. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 1196-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Photolysis of the CO form was achieved with laser pulses at 532 nm (Quantel). The subsequent return to the CO bound form involves a competitive binding of the CO and the sixth (protein) ligand. Several detection wavelengths were used to better separate the different spectroscopic species. These kinetics allow the determination of the CO on-rate, and both the on and off rates for the protein ligand. In a similar fashion, a mixed atmosphere of CO and oxygen was used to obtain the oxygen binding rates. Molecular Phylogenetic Analysis—Amino acid sequences of mollusc globins and the S. solidissima nHb were added manually to an established alignment of globin sequences (1Burmester T. Weich B. Reinhardt S. Hankeln T. Nature. 2000; 407: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 32Burmester T. Ebner B. Weich B. Hankeln T. Mol. Biol.

The selected sequences of mollusc Hbs and Mbs comprise Anadara trapezia (ark shell) HbIB (GenBank™ accession number P04251) and HbIIB (AtrHbIB, P14394); Barbatia lima (blood clam) HbA (BliHbA, S61520); Barbatia virescens (blood clam) HbI (BviHbI, AAB24577); Lucina pectinata HbI (LpeHbI, P41260), HbII (LpeHbII, P41261) and HbIII (LpeHbIII, P41262); Scapharca broughtonii HbI (SbrHbI, P02212); Scapharca inaequivalvis (ark clam) HbIIB (SinHbIIB, S09068); Dolabela auricularia (sea hare) Mb (DauMb, P09965); Nassa mutabilis (mutable nassa) Mb (NmuMb, P31331); Busycon canaliculatum (channeled whelk) Mb (BcaMb, P02214); Cerithidae rhizophorarum (water snail) Mb (CrhMb, P02215). The alignment further included the sequences: Homo sapiens NGB (HsaNGB, AJ245946), cytoglobin (HsaCYGB, AJ315162), Mb (HsaMB, M14603), and Hb α (HsaHBA, J00153), Hb β (HsaHBB, M36640), Hb δ (HsaHBD, AAH69307), Hb ∈ (HsaHBE, P02100); Mus musculus Ngb (MmuNgb, AJ245946), Cygb (MmuCygb, AJ315163) and Mb (MmuMb, P04247); A. aculeata nHb (Aac nHb, U46754); Glycera dibranchiata (bloodworm) Hb1 (GdiHb1, GGNW1B); Ciona intestinalis (sea squirt) Hbs 1 to 4 (CinHb1–4, AJ548500, AJ548501, AJ548502, AJ557135); C. lacteus (milky ribbon-worm) nHb (ClaHb, O76242); Medicago sativa (alfalfa) leghemoglobin (MsaLegHb, P09187); Lupinus luteus (alfalfa) leghemoglobin (LluLegHb, P02240); Casuarina glauca (swamp oak) Hb1 (CglHb1, P08054) and Hb2 (CglHb2, P23244); Oryza sativa (rice) Hb2 (OsaHb2, O04985). For the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees, the program packages TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 (34Strimmer K. von Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2275) Google Scholar), PHYLIP 3.6b (35Felsenstein, J.

Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar), and MrBayes 3.0 (37Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19257) Google Scholar) were used. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed with MrBayes 3.0 beta4, assuming the WAG substitution matrix model (38Whelan S. Goldman N. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar) of sequence evolution with gamma distribution of rates. Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling was performed with one cold and three heated chains that were run for 600,000 generations. Starting trees were random, trees were sampled every 10th generation, and three independent runs were performed. The posterior probabilities were estimated on the final 50,000 trees (burn-in, 10,000). For neighbor-joining analyses (39Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar), protein distances were calculated using the PAM substitution matrix (40Dayhoff M.O. Schwartz R.M. Orcutt B.C. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure.in: Dayhoff M.O. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D. C.1978: 345-352Google Scholar). The programs NEIGHBOR from the PHYLIP package and MEGA version 2.1 were employed for tree reconstruction. In the case of applying the program NEIGHBOR, TREE-PUZZLE 5.2 was used for calculation of distance matrices. The reliability of the trees was tested by bootstrap analyses (41Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 1,000 replications. Primary Structure and Gene Organization—A part of the S. solidissima nHb primary structure was reconstructed from the sequence of relevant peptides generated by tryptic digestion of the purified protein (Fig. 1). The full sequence was completed by sequencing the corresponding cDNA of the nHb (GenBank™ accession number AM086629). Fig. 1 also shows the alignment of the S. solidissima nHb with related globin sequences. Key amino acid positions of the globin structure such as NA2, B6, B14, C2, CD1, E7, F8, and H8 are conserved (42Bashford D. Chothia C. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 199-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). At the N terminus there is an extension of ∼6 amino acid residues, the fourth one being a cysteine. A second cysteine is present at position E12. Otherwise there are no remarkable amino acid substitutions compared with other mollusc hemoglobins (see Fig. 1). Conceptual translation of the 162-amino acid-long sequence predicted a molecular mass of 18,191 Da, excluding the N-terminal methionine. However, mass spectrometry data on the intact native nerve globin showed a molecular mass of 18,235 Da, which confirms the absence of the N-terminal methionine and suggests an N-terminal mono-acetylation (+42 Da). This is not so unusual as N-terminal acetylation is one of the most common protein modifications in eukaryotes, occurring on ∼85% of the different varieties of eukaryotic proteins but rarely on prokaryotic proteins (43Boissel J.P. Kasper T.J. Shah S.C. Malone J.I. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8448-8452Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 44Polevoda B. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36479-36482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We observed two additional molecular mass classes (18,333 and 18,430 Da) that differ from the native mono-acetylated protein by 98 and 196 Da, respectively (Fig. 2). These additional masses could agree with a binding of a mono- and a diphosphate to the nHb. Their physiological role, however, is unclear. The recombinant protein gave the single mass of 18,192 Da, with no additional acetylation. There was, however, an additional molecular mass class of 18,289 Da, suggesting again the presence of a phosphate. The binding of phosphate groups to both native and recombinant S. solidissima nHb was confirmed by ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining (data not shown).FIGURE 2Mass spectrum of native S. solidissima nHb. Intensity of the peaks plotted against the molecular mass.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Genomic DNA was extracted from S. solidissima foot and contractor muscle and pooled from multiple animals. The nHb gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced both directly and after cloning to resolve observed ™ sequence heterogeneities. The obtained sequence (GenBank accession number AM086630) contained differences in the intronic regions probably representing allelic polymorphisms, whereas only two variations in the coding exons were observed. We noted 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 4 insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the intronic regions, varying in length from 1 to 284 bp. The coding region of the S. solidissima nHb gene is distributed on three exons, consisting of 116, 226, and 144 bp (measured from the ATG start codon and excluding the stop codon), validating the results from the cDNA.

https://openalex.org/W2124356629,"We have recently proposed a “processive clamp” model for the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the mitochondrial ABC transporter Mdl1 (Janas, E., Hofacker, M., Chen, M., Gompf, S., van der Does, C., and Tampé, R. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 26862-26869). In this model, ATP binding to two monomeric NBDs leads to formation of an NBD dimer that, after hydrolysis of both ATPs, dissociates and releases ADP. Here, we set out to follow the association and dissociation of NBDs using a novel minimally invasive site-specific labeling technique, which provides stable and stoichiometric attachment of fluorophores. The association and dissociation kinetics of the E599Q-NBD dimer upon addition and removal of ATP were determined by fluorescence self-quenching. Remarkably, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the wild type NBD is determined by the rate of NBD dimerization. In the E599QNBD, however, in which the ATP hydrolysis is 250-fold reduced, the ATP hydrolysis reaction controls dimer dissociation and the overall ATPase cycle. These data explain contradicting observations on the rate-limiting step of various ABC proteins and further demonstrate that dimer formation is an important step in the ATP hydrolysis cycle.

ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; WT, wild type. 4The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; WT, wild type. transporters drive the translocation of substrates by the hydrolysis of ATP. They represent one of the largest transporter families and are found in all phyla of life (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar, 2Davidson A.L. Chen J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 241-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). ABC transporters have a conserved domain structure, which consists of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and two membrane-spanning domains. The membrane-spanning domains build the translocation pathway, whereas the NBDs function as motor energizing the transport. The membrane-spanning domains typically contain six transmembrane helices (TMHs), but the amino acid sequences are very diverse, and transporters with more or less transmembrane helices have been found. The highly conserved NBDs contain the Walker A, Walker B, and C-loop motifs. In eukaryotes, the domains are most commonly fused to one protein with the membrane-spanning domain and the NBD domains in an alternating order or as two half-size transporters where each transporter contains a membrane-spanning domain and an NBD. In Archaea and eubacteria, the domains are mostly found in four distinct units, although they also have been found fused in almost any possible combination. ABC transporters function as exporters; nevertheless, in prokaryotes and Archaea, some ABC transporters include a fifth domain, the substrate-binding protein, which turns the transporter into an importer. The structures of two distinct full-length ABC transporters and several isolated NBDs have been solved and showed that the structures of the NBDs are highly conserved (for reviews see Refs. 3Schmitt L. Tampé R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar and 4Ye J. Osborne A.R. Groll M. Rapoport T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1659: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The NBD monomer forms an L-shaped molecule with two domains. The first, RecA-like domain includes the ATP-binding core with the Walker A and B motifs, whereas the characteristic ABC signature (C-loop) motif is located in the second α-helical domain. In the monomeric NBD, the ABC signature motif is far away from the nucleotide, but in the dimeric state, the two monomers are oriented in a head-to-tail configuration, with two ATPs bound at the interface of the two monomers. The ATPs are sandwiched between the Walker A and B motifs from one monomer and the C-loop of the other, the C-loop thus complementing the nucleotide-binding site. ATP occupies a significant part of the dimer interface and thus stabilizes the dimeric state. Analyses of different nucleotide-bound and free states showed that ATP binding induced a rigid body movement of the two domains of the NBD, which aligns the monomers in such an “induced-fit” manner that the dimer can be formed. How ATP is exactly hydrolyzed is currently a matter of intense debate, and many different models have been proposed (reviewed in Ref. 5van der Does C. Tampé R. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The “alternating-site” model suggests that ATP hydrolysis occurs alternating in the two nucleotide-binding sites without dissociation of the dimer (6Senior A.E. Gadsby D.C. Semin Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis in the first catalytic site is followed by opening of this site, whereas the second catalytic site remains closed. Release of ADP and rebinding of ATP then induces closure of the site and leads to ATP hydrolysis in the second catalytic site. We have recently studied the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the NBD of Mdl1 (Multidrug resistance-like) (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), an intracellular peptide transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This homodimeric half-size ABC transporter is involved in the export of peptides with a length of 6-21 amino acids from the matrix (9Young L. Leonhard K. Tatsuta T. Trowsdale J. Langer T. Science. 2001; 291: 2135-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These peptides are derived from the degradation of non-assembled complexes of the inner mitochondrial membrane generated by ATP-dependent m-AAA (Matrix-oriented A TPases Associated with a variety of cellular Activities) proteases (10Arnold I. Langer T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The NBD of Mdl1 was overexpressed and purified to homogeneity (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The isolated NBD was active in ATP binding and hydrolysis. Three different catalytic intermediates of the NBD dimer were trapped either by incubation with orthovanadate or beryllium fluoride, or by exchange of the conserved glutamate downstream of the Walker B (E599Q). The nucleotide composition of intermediate states was determined using [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP. The three isolated dimeric intermediate states contain two ATPs, one ATP and one ADP, or two ADPs. Based on our and other biochemical and structural data (11Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Shin D.S. Craig L. Arthur L.M. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A.

Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), the “processive clamp” model for the catalytic cycle was proposed, in which association and dissociation of the NBDs depend on the status of bound nucleotides (5van der Does C. Tampé R. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this model, two ATPs are bound to two monomers, which results in formation of the dimer. Both ATPs are thereafter hydrolyzed, finally leading to dissociation of the dimer. Association and dissociation of the NBDs are therefore important characteristics of the processive clamp model. We set out to study the relationship between the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis and the association and dissociation rates of the NBDs. We designed His-tag-specific fluorescent probes, which allow a site-specific, stable, stoichiometric, and minimally invasive labeling of the NBD. This strategy was successfully applied to resolve the dynamic interaction of the NBDs within the ATP hydrolysis cycle. Based on the association and dissociation kinetics, we identified the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis cycle for the NBDs of Mdl1 and discussed the consequences for the current models for ATP hydrolysis in ABC proteins. Tris-NTA(ATTO565) Synthesis—To prevent quenching of the fluorophore by complexed nickel ions, tris-NTA was coupled on solid phase to the N terminus of the proline linker peptide, PPPPCA. TrisNTA was synthesized as described (15Lata S. Reichel A. Brock R. Tampé R. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10205-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). After deprotection and cleavage from the resin, the cysteine residue was labeled with ATTO565-male-imide (ATTO-TEC GmbH, Siegen, Germany) via standard thiol-chemistry. Products were purified via reversed-phase C18 HPLC. The trisNTA(ATTO565) was loaded with nickel as described (15Lata S. Reichel A. Brock R. Tampé R. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10205-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the concentration was determined via the absorption of the fluorophore. Details of the synthesis will be described elsewhere. 5K. Schulze and R. Tampé, manuscript in preparation. Expression and Purification of Mdl1-NBD in Escherichia coli—Overexpression and purification of the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD using nickel-affinity and gel filtration chromatography were performed as described (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Tris-NTA(ATTO565) labeling—To determine stable and stoichio-metric labeling with tris-NTA(ATTO565), 8 μm of E599Q-NBD were mixed with various ratios of tris-NTA(ATTO565) in assay buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column. To study the dimer formation, 8 μm E599Q-NBD labeled with equimolar tris-NTA(ATTO565) were incubated with 1 mm ATP for 5 min on ice and then applied to the gel filtration column (50-μl injection volume). The Super-dex 200 column was equilibrated with assay buffer and run at 6 °C at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Dimer formation was monitored at 280 and 565 nm. Kinetics of Dimer Association and Dissociation—To analyze the rate of dimer association, 10 μm E599Q-NBD were labeled with an equimolar amount of tris-NTA(ATTO565) in assay buffer and applied to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2 gel filtration column equilibrated with assay buffer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 6 °C (50-μl injection volume). Fractions containing the labeled NBD were collected, and the protein concentration was determined using the micro BCA assay (Pierce). The labeled NBD was transferred to a 150-μl quartz cuvette and diluted to the appropriate concentrations with the assay buffer plus 5 mm Mg2+. After addition of nucleotides (1 mm), self-quenching of the fluorophore was followed over time in a temperature-controlled Cary Eclipse fluorometer (Varian Instruments; λex/em = 565/595 nm, slit-widths 5 nm). The association rate constant (kon) was determined from the slope of the plot of the reciprocal value of the monomeric NBD concentration versus time, whereas the dissociation rate constant (koff) was obtained from the slope of the plot of natural log of the dimeric NBD concentration versus time. Experiments were performed at 65, 125, 250, and 375 nm NBD, at 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C, and in the presence of 5, 10, and 15% (w/v) sucrose. As controls, similar experiments were performed with the WT-NBD or the E599Q-NBD in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 10 μm of unlabeled E599Q-NBD. To analyze dimer dissociation, 10 μm E599Q-NBD were incubated with 10 μm tris-NTA(ATTO565) and 2 mm ATP. After isolation of the labeled dimer by gel filtration, the decrease in fluorescence self-quenching upon dimer dissociation was measured at 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C. Again, experiments were performed in the presence of 5, 10, and 15% (w/v) sucrose. Determination of ATP Hydrolysis Rate—ATPase activities were measured by the malachite green assay as described (16Baykov A.A. Sergina N.V. Evtushenko O.A. Dubnova E.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ATPase assay was performed with 5 μm NBD in assay buffer plus 5 mm Mg2+ at 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C in the presence of 0-2 mm ATP or with 0-150 μm NBD in assay buffer plus 5 mm Mg2+ in the presence of 2 mm ATP at 25 °C. The activity of the E599Q-NBD was measured in the same way but with longer incubation times. Similar experiments were performed in the assay buffer plus 5 mm Mg2+ containing 5, 10, and 15% (w/v) sucrose. To determine the ATPase activity of the NBD labeled with tris-NTA(ATTO565), a radioactive ATPase assay was used (17Gorbulev S. Abele R. Tampé R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3732-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μm NBD were incubated with 2 mm ATP supplemented with 13.5 μm [γ-32P]ATP in a total volume of 50 μl for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped with 1 ml of 10 mm ammonium molybdate in 1 m HCl. Subsequently, 15 μl of 20 mm H3PO4 and 2 ml of a butanol/cyclohexane/acetone (5:5:1) mixture were added. The organic phase was extracted, and the radioactivity in this phase was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Self-quenching of two fluorescently labeled proteins has been extensively applied to determine the kinetics of association and dissociation of interacting proteins. For protein labeling, often thiol-specific fluorescent probes are reacted with single cysteine mutants. The NBD contains three cysteines, which could be mutated to serines without affecting the ATPase activity of the purified NBD (data not shown). However, specific labeling of single cysteine mutants with maleimide-specific probes strongly impaired the ATPase activity and dimer formation (data not shown). We therefore searched for a minimally invasive approach to label the NBD site-specifically. We developed multivalent chelator heads, which bind with nanomolar affinities to histidine tags (15Lata S. Reichel A. Brock R. Tampé R. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10205-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To follow the association and dissociation of NBDs during their ATP hydrolysis cycle in real time, we coupled the tris-NTA chelator head to the ATTO565 fluorophore. In addition, a polyproline spacer was introduced between the multivalent chelator head and the fluorophore to prevent fluorescence quenching by metal binding (Fig. 1A). The His-tagged NBD was stably labeled by tris-NTA(ATTO565) with (1:1) stoichiometry as shown by gel filtration (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, in contrast to all other attempts in labeling ABC proteins without affecting their function, the labeled NBD showed the same ATPase activity as the unlabeled one (Fig. 1C). To study the association and dissociation of the NBDs, the E599QNBD was used. In this mutant, the conserved glutamate downstream of the Walker B motif was mutated to a glutamine resulting in a stable ATP-dependent dimer formation (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Indeed, after incubation of the tris-NTA(ATTO565)-labeled E599Q-NBD with ATP, the dimeric species was observed after gel filtration (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that dimer formation is not affected by the attachment of the fluorophore. Based on homology modeling on the ATP-bound dimer of MJ0796, the two fluorophores are in the Mdl1-NBD dimer at a distance of 6 nm, approximately the Förster radius of the ATTO565 probe (Fig. 2B). Indeed, incubation of the E599Q-NBD with ATP resulted in a specific self-quenching of the fluorescence (Fig. 2C). Thus, dimer formation of the tris-NTA(ATTO565)-labeled E599Q-NBD could be followed over time. For the monomeric NBD, fluorescence quenching was observed after addition of ATP, whereas, for the dimer, a recovery in fluorescence intensity to the level of the monomeric species was observed over time (Fig. 2D). This indicates a specific self-quenching of the fluorescent probes after association of the NBDs. However, no change in fluorescence was detected when ADP, AMP (Fig. 2C), or the WT-NBD was used (data not shown). Furthermore, the fluorescence quenching could be specifically competed with an excess of unlabeled E599Q-NBD (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the self-quenching is dimer-specific and not caused by a conformational change. Worth mentioning, similar results were obtained with tris-NTA(OregonGreen)-labeled NBDs or with different resonance energy transfer pairs. However, to avoid any asymmetric situation within a homodimeric complex, all experiments were performed with the tris-NTA(ATTO565)-labeled NBD. Taken together, these data demonstrate that these novel tris-NTA-fluorophores label the ABC protein stably and stoichiometrically and that association of the E599Q-NBD dimer results in self-quenching of the ATTO565 probe. We next derived the rate of dimer formation from the decrease of fluorescence after addition of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 3A). At this ATP concentration, ATP binding is very fast, and does not influence the rate of the dimerization process (see “Discussion”). As expected for a dimerization with a slow backward reaction, a linear relation was observed when the reciprocal value of the monomeric NBD concentration was plotted against the reaction time (Fig. 3B). This allowed us to calculate the rates (kon) for dimer association. The kon values were determined at different temperatures and are summarized in Table 1. From the temperature dependence of the association rate constant (Fig. 3E), an activation energy for dimer association of 68 kJ/mol was determined.TABLE 1Rate constants of E599Q-NBD dimer association and dissociation at different temperaturesTemperaturekonkoff°Cmin−1 μm−1min−1100.18 ± 0.0350.012 ± 0.002150.32 ± 0.0500.024 ± 0.004200.50 ± 0.0480.036 ± 0.005250.80 ± 0.2100.054 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab After isolation of the dimer by gel filtration, we followed the dissociation of the labeled NBD dimer over time (Fig. 3C). The fluorescence reached a similar final value after prolonged incubation at the different temperatures (data not shown). As expected for a dissociation process where no reassociation occurs, a linear relationship was observed when the natural log of the dimeric NBD concentration was plotted against the reaction time (Fig. 3D). This allowed us to calculate the rate constants for dimer dissociation (koff) at different temperatures (Table 1). From the temperature dependence of the dissociation rate constants, an activation energy of 69 kJ/mol was calculated (Fig. 3E). We next related the rates identified for dimer association and dissociation to the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The ATP hydrolysis activity of the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD were determined at different temperatures as a function of the ATP concentration (Fig. 4, A and C) and as a function of the NBD concentration (Fig. 4, B and D). The WT-NBD showed normal ATP-dependent Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 0.6 mm (Fig. 4A), whereas the ATPase activity was non-linearly dependent on the protein concentration (Fig. 4B). Compared with the WT-NBD, the E599Q-NBD has a 250-fold reduced ATPase activity and a slightly lowered Km of 0.2 mm (Fig. 4C). The ATPase activity of the E599Q-NBD showed normal Michaelis-Menten kinetics. However, contrasting with our observation of the WT-NBD, the ATPase activity of the E599Q-NBD was independent of the NBD concentration (Fig. 4D). This shows that different steps in the ATP hydrolysis cycle are rate-limiting for the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD. A shift in the rate-limiting step is often associated with a change in activation energy. The WT and the E599Q-NBD however showed rather similar temperature dependences of the ATP hydrolysis rates (Fig. 4E), with activation energies of 73 and 69 kJ/mol for the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD, respectively. Within the margin of error, these activation energies are similar to those for association and dissociation of the E599Q-NBD dimer, and we were therefore unable to determine the rate-limiting step based on the activation energies of the different steps. To further examine the difference in the concentration dependence of the ATPase activity of the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD, the rates of the different steps were determined in solutions of different viscosi-ties. The molecular diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the viscosity of the solution, and diffusion-controlled reactions are slowed down at higher viscosities (18Martin S.F. Hergenrother P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4403-4408Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of dimer association (Fig. 5A) and the ATPase activity of the WT-NBD (Fig. 5B) were both dependent on the viscosity, whereas the rate of dimer dissociation (Fig. 5A) and the ATPase activity of the E599Q-NBD (Fig. 5B) did not show any dependence. These results further demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis in the WT-NBD is concentration-dependent, whereas ATP-hydrolysis in the E599Q-NBD is concentration-independent. Finally, the concentration dependence of the ATPase activity of the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD were compared with the rates of the association and dissociation of the E599Q dimer (Fig. 6). Strikingly, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the WT-NBD was almost identical to the rate of dimerization of the E599Q-NBD and showed an equivalent dependence on the NBD concentration. This confirms that, for the WT-NBD, the association of the NBDs or a step before is rate-limiting. Because ATP binding to the NBD occurs very fast (20Liu R. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11865-11873Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Qu Q. Russell P.L. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”), this suggests that the dimer association step is the rate-limiting step in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the WT-NBD. Contrary to the WT-NBD, the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the E599Q-NBD was very similar to the rate of E599Q dimer dissociation. This demonstrates that either dimer dissociation or a step before is rate-limiting. In the WT-NBD, where ATP hydrolysis is much faster, dimer dissociation is not rate-limiting, indicating that dimer dissociation (at least after ATP hydrolysis) is also a very rapid step. We can therefore conclude that in the E599Q mutant, the ATP hydrolysis reaction is the rate-limiting step in the ATP hydro-lysis cycle. Analyses of protein networks and domain interactions within complex machineries are of emerging interest in modern biology. Fluorescence quenching and Förster resonance energy transfer are frequently applied to follow the kinetics of and structural rearrangements within such assemblies. A widely used technique is to introduce fluorescent groups with overlapping emission spectra, e.g. by coupling reactive fluorescent probes to single cysteine residues. Unfortunately, single cysteine mutants often do not have the activity of the WT protein or, likewise after labeling with thiol-specific probes, show a reduced activity. Also the labeling of each of the three single cysteine mutants of Mdl1 resulted in a drastic reduction of the ATPase activity. In this study, the His-tagged NBD of Mdl1 was labeled with a new fluorescent probe linked to a multivalent tris-NTA group. Tethering of three NTA moieties substantially increased the binding affinity (from a Kd value of 14 μm to 20 nm), which led to a stable, stoichiometric, and site-specific labeling of His-tagged proteins (15Lata S. Reichel A. Brock R. Tampé R. Piehler J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 10205-10215Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We further improved the quantum yield of the fluorescence label by introducing a polyproline sequence between the tris-NTA group and the fluorophore, which functions as a rigid spacer to prevent quenching by nickel bound to tris-NTA. Strikingly, after site-specific labeling with tris-NTA(ATTO565), the activity of the NBD was fully retained. The labeled NBD was therefore excellently suited to study the dynamic association and dissociation of the NBDs in real time. The facts that the His-tags are currently the most widely applied affinity tags and that labeling is site-specific, stoichiometric, and takes place under mild conditions with nanomolar affinity, make this new labeling technique widely applicable for the analysis of dynamic protein interactions within macromolecular assemblies even in cell lysates or at the surfaces of living cells. 5K. Schulze and R. Tampé, manuscript in preparation. Here, this new labeling technique was used to investigate the kinetics of the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the mitochondrial ABC transporter Mdl1. It was previously shown that ATP hydrolysis by the NBD occurs via the processive clamp model (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this model, one catalytic cycle consists of ATP binding to two monomers, followed by formation of an NBD dimer, where, after both ATPs are hydrolyzed, the dimer dissociates, and ADP is released. We set out to resolve the kinetics of the different steps of the WT and mutant NBD. The steady-state binding of nucleotides to ABC transporters has been studied extensively, but, to our knowledge, there is currently no data available about the exact rates of nucleotide binding and release to ABC proteins. Because comparable processes like ATP binding to the F1F0-ATPase (36 min-1 μm-1 (22Lobau S. Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10846-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)) and the Na,K-ATPase (1800 min-1 μm-1 (23Fedosova N.U. Champeil P. Esmann M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) are much faster than our observed rates for ATP hydrolysis, ATP binding was expected not to be rate-limiting. To get an estimation of the rate of nucleotide binding, the tyrosine (Tyr-441) at the adenine-stacking position in the NBD of Mdl1 was changed to a tryptophan residue. This residue is conserved in most NBDs as either a tryptophan or tyrosine and is involved in positioning the purine base by π-π stacking. Nucleotide-dependent quenching of this residue has previously been used to determine the equilibrium binding of nucleotides to different NBDs (13Smith P.C. Karpowich N. Millen L. Moody J.E. Rosen J. Thomas P.J. Hunt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 139-149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 24Schneider E. Wilken S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20456-20461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26Rai V. Shukla S. Jha S. Komath S.S. Prasad R. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 6650-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Also in the NBD of Mdl1, the introduced single tryptophan directly sensed the bound nucleotide and resulted in 30% ATP and ADP-dependent quenching of the fluorescence for both the WT and the E599Q mutant (data not shown). Time-dependent experiments demonstrated that nucleotide binding occurred within the mixing time of the experiments, with apparent rate constants faster than 30 min-1 μm-1. 6C. van der Does, C. Presenti, and R. Tampé, unpublished results. These rate constants are at least two orders of magnitude faster than ATP hydrolysis by the NDB of Mdl1 or the dimer formation of the E599Q mutant, thus excluding the possibility that nucleotide binding is rate-limiting under the conditions used in our experiments. Because ATP binding is not the rate-limiting step, we focused on the kinetics of the association and dissociation of the NBDs. The concentration of the transiently formed WT dimer is far below the detectable limit, and only the monomeric species is normally observed. Several attempts have been made to stabilize the WT ATP dimer, such as using non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues or experiments in the absence of Mg2+, but these attempts were unsuccessful. The ATP-dependent dimer was only observed after mutagenesis of the NBD or after trapping with vanadate or beryllium fluoride (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Vanadate or beryllium fluoride trapping occurs, however, after ATP hydrolysis and possibly after several rounds dimer association and dissociation and therefore cannot be used to study the association process. We therefore determined the rate of dimer association for the E599Q-NBD. Remarkably, the rates of dimer association of the E599Q-NBD and the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the WT-NBD were comparable and showed a similar dependence on the diffusion rate and the NBD concentration, whereas the rate of association of the E599Q-NBD was equal to the rate of ATP hydrolysis of the WT protein. Under the assumption that the rates of dimer association in the WT and the E599Q mutant are similar, the rate of dimer association is the rate-limiting step in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of the WTNBD of Mdl1. ADP release is often discussed as the rate-limiting step, but our experiments demonstrate that this is not the case, because ADP release would be a concentration-independent process. Furthermore, competition assays with non-labeled and fluorescent nucleotides showed that under the conditions used in our experiments, the ADP release rate was at least 1 s-1. 6C. van der Does, C. Presenti, and R. Tampé, unpublished results. Thus, steps like the ATP hydrolysis reaction, dimer dissociation, and ADP release occur faster than the rate-limiting step of dimer association. Similar dependences of the ATPase activities on the NBD concentration (with Hill coefficients of ∼1.7) have previously been reported for isolated NBDs like HisP (27Nikaido K. Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27745-27752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), NBD-Mdl1 (8Janas E. Hofacker M. Chen M. Gompf S. van der Does C. Tampé R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26862-26869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and NBD-HlyB (25Zaitseva J. Jenewein S. Jumpertz T. Holland I.B. Schmitt L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These data can be interpreted by a monomer-dimer equilibrium. We however propose that the concentration dependence can also be explained by a shift in the rate-limiting step when at higher protein concentrations with an increasing rate of dimerization, a step that is not concentration-dependent like the ATP hydrolysis reaction, dissociation of the dimer or the release of ADP becomes rate-limiting. This has indeed been observed for HisP, the NBD of the histidine permease (28Liu P.Q. Ames G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3495-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and full-length Mdl1. 7M. Hofacker, A. Zutz, S. Gompf, C. van der Does, and R. Tampé, manuscript in preparation. Noticeably, in the E599Q-NBD, ATP hydrolysis is independent on the viscosity and the NBD concentration, suggesting that here another step is slower than the dimerization of the NBDs. Because the steady-state nucleotide binding affinities of the WT-NBD and the E599Q-NBD are similar, it is very likely that the rate of ADP release is also similar in both proteins, signifying that ADP release from the monomeric E599Q-NBD is not the rate-limiting step. Indeed, in the E599Q-NBD, ATP hydrolysis is strictly coupled to the rate of E599Q-NBD dissociation. Because we have previously proven that in the isolated E599Q-NBD dimers dissociation can occur only after hydrolysis of the ATPs, it is very likely that the ATP hydrolysis in the NBD is the rate-limiting step. Several models have previously been proposed for the ATP hydrolysis cycle of ABC proteins. Importantly, the concentration dependence of the ATPase activity of the Mdl1-NBD fits well with the expected kinetics for the processive clamp model with association and dissociation steps for the NBD in every turn-over but cannot be explained with an “alternating site” model, because this model assumes that the NBDs remain in contact during consecutive ATP hydrolysis cycles. The processive clamp model is further supported by the crystal structures of isolated NBDs, which always showed the symmetry of the two monomers with equal occupation of both nucleotide-binding sites (11Hopfner K.P.

Notably, a negative cooperativity as expected for an alternating site model was never observed for any soluble NBD, suggesting that the ATP hydrolysis cycle of soluble NBDs occurs via the processive clamp model. Data obtained for full-length transporters, like P-gp and MalFGK2, which showed that 8-azido-ATP photolabeling after beryllium fluoride or orthovanadate trapping resulted in ∼1[α-32P]ADP bound per dimer (7Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) conflicts, however, with the processive clamp model. Furthermore, the ATPase activity of many full-length ABC transporters is stimulated by their substrate, demonstrating that in the full-length transporter, the rate-limiting step can be altered when substrates are present. Apparently, the ATP hydrolysis cycle of full-length transporters is more complicated than observed in isolated NBDs. Our data suggest that at higher (local) concentrations of the NBD, which are found, e.g. in full-length transporters, another step, e.g. ATP hydrolysis, becomes rate-limiting and possibly can be stimulated by substrates. How far the ATP hydrolysis cycle of full-length transporters differs from the cycle in soluble NBDs still has to be determined. Therefore, determination of the rate-limiting step(s) in the ATP hydrolysis cycle of a full-length protein and the effects of substrates on the steps in the ATP hydrolysis cycle will also be essential in our understanding of how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to the transport of substrates. In this respect, the new site-specific labeling technique can be very useful to resolve the dynamics of the NBDs within these translocation machineries.

For low p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> acids the total concentration of salt required near neutral pH was high. The ionic strength effect of added salts stimulated the rate of proton-coupled electron transfer at pH < 7, but decreased it at pH > 7.5, indicating an effective isoelectric point between these limits. In this region, a substantial rate enhancement by weak acids was clearly evident. A Brønsted plot of activity <i>versus</i> p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> of the rescuing acids was linear, with a slope of -1, and extrapolated to a diffusion-limited rate at p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i><sup>app</sup> ≈ 1.

We found that PPM1D stimulated the activity of several nuclear receptors including the progesterone receptor (PR) and estrogen receptor. Although p38 MAPK inhibited PR activity, PPM1D stimulation of PR activity was greater than that achieved by a chemical inhibitor of p38 MAPK, SB202190. This suggests an additional novel function for PPM1D. Consistent with this, the transcriptional activity of endogenous PR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was preferentially inhibited by small interfering RNA for PPM1D; SB202190 failed to reverse the inhibition. Although PPM1D phosphatase activity was required for stimulation of transcriptional activity, the activity of a PR phosphorylation site null mutant was enhanced by PPM1D, indicating that PR is not the direct target. Additional studies revealed that PPM1D enhanced the intrinsic activity of p160 coactivators such as steroid receptor coactivator-1 and promoted the interaction between PR and steroid receptor coactivator-1 in a mammalian two-hybrid assay. Neither activity was induced by SB202190. Although PPM1D stimulated PR activity in part through inhibition of p38 MAPK, its primary action is novel and independent of p38 MAPK. Thus, we speculate that PPM1D promotes breast tumor growth both by inhibiting p53 activity and by enhancing steroid hormone receptor action.

One candidate PR regulatory phosphatase that we investigated was protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1 δ (PPM1D), also known as Wip1 (wild type p53-induced phosphatase 1). PPM1D was discovered in a screen for ionizing radiation and p53-dependent target genes (16Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were treated with hormone (10 nm) for an additional 24 h and harvested as described below. Transfection of Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—MCF-7 cells plated at 200,000 cells/6-well plate were transfected with 100 pmol of control siRNA or siRNA against PPM1D. siRNAs were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX), using predesigned siRNA against PPM1D (identification number 4785) and non-targeting control siRNA or SMART pool siRNA (M-004554-00) for PPM1D and Non-Specific Control SMARTpool reagent from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was incubated with DMEM at a 1:4 ratio at room temperature for 10 min. In a separate tube, the indicated amount of siRNA was incubated with 185 μl/well DMEM.

Medium was aspirated off the MCF-7 cells, and 800 μl of DMEM were added to each well with 200 μl of the transfection mixture. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h before 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum was added, and the cells were treated with 10 nm estradiol to induce PR expression. Twenty-four hours later, the progestin-responsive reporter GRE2-E1b-LUC was transfected into the cells, which were ∼70% confluent. Per well, 3 μlof TransIT-LT1 (Mirus, Madison, WI) was incubated with 100 μl of warmed Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for 10 min at room temperature. The GRE2-E1b-LUC reporter was added to the mixture (0.25 μg/well) and incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature. The transfection mixture was then added directly to the cells (100 μl). After 24 h, medium was replaced with 5% charcoal-stripped serum in DMEM containing 10 nm estradiol and 10 nm R5020. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested as described below, and luciferase assays were performed as well as Western blot analysis using equal amounts of protein as determined by Bradford assay. Protein Extract Preparation and Reporter Gene Analysis—Luciferase assays were performed using reagents from Promega on a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Lab, Ann Arbor, MI). The luciferase values were normalized to β-galactosidase levels unless otherwise noted. Cells were harvested in TEN (0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 m EDTA, 0.04 m Tris, pH. 8.0) at room temperature. The cells were pelleted at 12,500 rpm for 25 s. Cell pellets were resuspended in 250 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 0.4 m NaCl and subjected to three rounds of freezethaws. Protein levels were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and β-galactosidase levels were determined using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (39Zhang Y. Bai W. Allgood V.E. Weigel N.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Reporter gene assays were performed a minimum of three times with each variable in triplicate, and a representative assay is shown. Western Analysis—Volumes of cell extracts containing equal protein or β-galactosidase units were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry apparatus at 30 mA for 15 min. For the PR antibody 1294, the membrane was blocked in 1× Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) + 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min and incubated with 0.5 μg/ml antibody overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the blots were washed three times with TBST and incubated with 1 μg/5 ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG in TBST with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed three times with TBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-tagged antibody to the secondary antibody for 1 h. The blots were washed three times with TBST and once with Tris-buffered saline + 0.3% Tween 20. The signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). For β-actin and PPM1D antibodies, milk was substituted for bovine serum albumin during blocking. For primary blot incubation, a 1:30,000 dilution of β-actin antibody was used, and for PPM1D 1 μg/ml antibody was used; both were in 1× TBST with 1% milk. Blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with TBST, then incubated with 1 μg/10 ml donkey anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-tagged antibody for 1 h in TBST, and detected as described above. PPM1D Enhances the Activity of Class One and Class Two Nuclear Receptors—To determine whether PPM1D is capable of stimulating steroid receptor activity, expression vectors for the two PR isoforms, androgen receptor (AR), or estrogen receptor α (ERα) were cotransfected into HeLa cells with their corresponding luciferase reporter plasmids, and the effects of PPM1D on hormone-dependent induction of reporter activity were measured. The activity of endogenous vitamin D receptor (VDR) was measured by transfecting cells with a VDR-responsive reporter. Coexpression of PPM1D enhanced PRA and PRB activity 3–5-fold as well as the activities of AR, ERα, and VDR (Fig. 1A). To exclude the possibility that the observed enhancement in activity was due to increased receptor expression, PRA levels in the samples from Fig. 1A were measured by Western blotting (Fig. 1B); no increase in PRA expression was observed. A similar enhancement of PR-dependent activity was seen in COS cells as well as on an MMTV-Luc reporter (data not shown) suggesting that PPM1D stimulation is not limited to a specific cell type or promoter. Although PPM1D enhances the activity of all tested nuclear receptors, this is not a result of a general increase in transcription. As a control, the effect of PPM1D on the activity of a constitutively active CMV Luc construct was assessed, and no change in the transactivation was detected (Fig. 1C). As an additional control, we confirmed that PPM1D inhibits p53 activity as expected by transfecting HeLa cells with a p53 expression vector, a p53-responsive reporter, and PPM1D or vector control. As shown in Fig. 1C, PPM1D expression inhibited p53 activity ∼50%. Although the basal activity of the GRE2-E1b-LUC reporter in the absence of added steroid receptor is quite low, as a final control we measured the effect of PPM1D on this activity but found essentially no effect (Fig. 1C). Endogenous PPM1D Is Required for Optimal PR Activity—To determine whether PPM1D modulates activity of endogenously expressed PR, MCF-7 breast cancer cells (which express both PRA and PRB) were transfected with empty vector or PPM1D and the PR-responsive GRE2E1b-LUC reporter; a PPM1D-dependent increase in total luciferase activity was observed (Fig. 2A). We next asked whether reducing the expression of endogenous PPM1D would affect PR function. MCF-7 cells were first transfected with 100 pmol of non-targeting control siRNA or 100 pmol of siRNA against PPM1D and treated 4 h post-transfection with 10 nm estradiol to induce PR expression. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with a GRE2E1b-LUC reporter plasmid, and after 24 h, the medium was replaced and supplemented with 10 nm estradiol and 10 nm R5020. Twenty-four hours later cells were harvested and assayed for PPM1D protein expression (Fig. 2B) and PR activity (Fig. 2C). The specific PPM1D siRNA caused a significant decrease in PPM1D protein levels compared with the control siRNA without altering β-actin levels (Fig. 2B). Importantly PR activity measured using a PR-responsive reporter decreased almost to basal activity only in the presence of siRNA against PPM1D (Fig. 2C) indicating that PPM1D is required for optimal PR activity. Similar results were obtained with a second siRNA targeting PPM1D that was also used for studies in Fig. 10 (data not shown).FIGURE 10PPM1D regulates PR activity independently of its ability to inhibit p38 MAPK. A, MCF-7 cells were transfected with non-targeting siRNA or siRNA against PPM1D (Dharmacon) followed by 250 ng of GRE2-E1b-LUC. Cells were treated with Me2SO (DMSO) control or 5 μm SB202190 36 h later and at 48 h were treated with 10 nm R5020 or ethanol. Luciferase activity or protein expression was measured 8 h later. Luciferase values were normalized using equal units of protein. B, equal amounts of protein were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE gels and probed with the indicated antibodies. Each experiment was done a minimum of three times with three independent wells of cells for each variable in the luciferase assays.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To define the domain or domains responsible for the increase in transcriptional activity of PR by PPM1D, constructs of PRB and PRA lacking the hormone binding domain but containing the remaining portions of PRA and PRB containing amino acids 164–684 (NTA) and 1–684 (NTB), respectively, were made. Additionally a C/D/E construct coding for amino acids 545–933, containing just the DNA binding domain, hinge, and ligand binding domain, was tested. The truncated constructs were cotransfected with PPM1D or vector in HeLa cells and treated with hormone, and luciferase activity was measured. PPM1D increased the constitutive activity of the amino-terminal PRB fragment 4-fold (Fig. 3A) and the amino-terminal PRA fragment 2-fold (Fig. 3B). The addition of PPM1D to cells transfected with the C/D/E construct also caused a hormone-dependent increase in activity (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that PPM1D acts through both PR activation functions similar to some coactivators.FIGURE 3PPM1D utilizes AF-1 and AF-2 of PR similarly to coregulators. A, HeLa cells were transfected with 1 ng of the expression vector for PRB or NTB, 250 ng of GRE2-E1b-LUC, 50 ng of CMV β-Gal, and 50 ng of either PPM1D or vector and subsequently treated with 10 nm R5020 or vehicle. Because the amino-terminal construct lacks a ligand binding domain, the cells containing an amino-terminal construct were treated with ethanol only. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection, and values were normalized using β-galactosidase. B, similarly HeLa cells were transfected with 1 ng of PRA or 2 ng of NTA, 250 ng of GRE2-E1b-LUC, 50 ng CMV β-Gal, and 50 ng of either PPM1D or vector and subsequently treated with 10 nm R5020. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection, and values were normalized using β-galactosidase. C, HeLa cells were transfected with 2 ng of the DBD-ligand binding domain of PR (C/D/E), 250 ng of GRE2-E1b-LUC, 50 ng of CMV β-Gal, and 50 ng of either PPM1D or vector and subsequently treated with 10 nm R5020.

https://openalex.org/W1969014956,"FAD-dependent polyamine oxidase (PAO; EC 1.5.3.11) is one of the key enzymes in the catabolism of polyamines spermidine and spermine. The natural substrates for the enzyme are N1-acetylspermidine, N1-acetylspermine, and N1,N12-diacetylspermine. Here we report that PAO, which normally metabolizes achiral substrates, oxidized (R)-isomer of 1-amino-8-acetamido-5-azanonane and N1-acetylspermidine as efficiently while (S)-1-amino-8-acetamido-5-azanonane was a much less preferred substrate. It has been shown that in the presence of certain aldehydes, the substrate specificity of PAO and the kinetics of the reaction are changed to favor spermine and spermidine as substrates. Therefore, we examined the effect of several aldehydes on the ability of PAO to oxidize different enantiomers of α-methylated polyamines. PAO supplemented with benzaldehyde predominantly catalyzed the cleavage of (R)-isomer of α-methylspermidine, whereas in the presence of pyridoxal the (S)-α-methylspermidine was preferred. PAO displayed the same stereospecificity with both singly and doubly α-methylated spermine derivatives when supplemented with the same aldehydes. Structurally related ketones proved to be ineffective. This is the first time that the stereospecificity of FAD-dependent oxidase has been successfully regulated by changing the supplementary aldehyde.

Spd and Spm appear to be able to substitute for each other to some extent (9Perez-Cano F.J. Franch A. Castellote C. Castell M. Cell.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 877-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). One of the approaches to elucidate the impact of each individual polyamine in biological processes is the use of metabolically stable Spd and Spm analogues. Examples of such compounds are MeSpd and bis-α,α′-methylspermine (Me2Spm) that are able to fulfill many of the cellular functions of their native counterparts.Earlier, we have successfully used racemic α-methyl analogs of polyamines to study the role of each individual polyamine in vivo. Both MeSpd and Me2Spm are capable of preventing acute pancreatitis and restoring early liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy under the condition of severe depletion of the natural polyamines in transgenic rats (12Räsänen T.L.

This prompted us to study the effect of aldehydes on this reaction using recently synthesized isomers of MeSpd and α-methylspermine (MeSpm) as well as the three diastereomers of Me2Spm (Fig. 1). In the present paper, the interactions of recombinant hPAO with different enantiomers of AcMeSpd have been studied.We found that for hPAO, using achiral molecules as native substrates, (S)-AcMeSpd was clearly an inferior substrate in comparison with (R)-AcMeSpd, which itself was as effectively catabolized as AcSpd. Moreover, the supplementation of hPAO with different aldehydes regulated the stereospecificity of this enzyme. Thus, PAO in the presence of BA predominantly oxidized (R)-MeSpd, whereas in the presence of pyridoxal (PL), the (S)–isomer was preferred. In the case of MeSpm and Me2Spm, the stereospecificity of oxidation could also be controlled by different aldehydes.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals—Racemic α-methylated polyamine analogs were synthesized as described in Refs. 14Grigorenko N.A.

(R)-AcMeSpd had Km = 95 μm and kcat = 9.0 s–1, whereas for (S)-AcMeSpd Km and kcat values were 170 μm and 1.2 s–1, respectively. It should be noted that AcSpd, the native substrate of PAO, had Km = 14 μm and kcat = 8.5 s–1 under the same conditions.Initial Screening Studies with hPAO Supplemented with Various Carbonyl Compounds—The effect of seven aromatic aldehydes on the stereoselectivity of hPAO is depicted in Table 1 (for results with 17 tested aldehydes see supplemental Table S1). All reaction mixtures containing racemic, (R)- or (S)-MeSpd were supplemented with a 5 mm concentration of the tested aldehyde, and the same mixtures without the enzyme were used as controls. Aromatic aldehydes were superior to aliphatic ones in enhancing the reaction rate of hPAO (supplemental Table S1). The enzyme showed strong preference toward (R)-MeSpd with most of the tested aldehydes, of which BA was the most effective. The structure of the aldehyde was one of the key factors determining the extent of the enhancement. For example, the effect of o-, m-, or p-hydroxybenzaldehydes totally depended on the position of the hydroxyl group (Table 1). Among the tested aldehydes, PL was the only (S)-guiding aldehyde changing the preference of hPAO to (S)-MeSpd. Thus, in the initial screening we were able to identify (S)-guiding PL, (R)-guiding BA, and P4CA that enhanced the degradation of both isomers of MeSpd. All of the structurally related and tested ketones proved to be inactive at 5 mm concentrations (data not shown, structures of the used ketones are given in supplemental Table S2).TABLE 1The effects of selected aromatic aldehydes on isomer specificity of human polyamine oxidase Open table in a new tab Studies with Liver Extracts Obtained from Wild-type Wistar Rats—To exclude the possibility that hPAO, as a recombinant protein containing His6 tag fragment, would behave differently in comparison with the native enzyme, crude liver extracts were used as the source of PAO to study the effects of guide molecules in vitro. The data in Table 2 clearly show that the reaction rate was increased by the key aldehydes similarly for both recombinant hPAO and rat liver enzyme. Moreover, steering of the isomer specificity was also possible in the crude liver extract.TABLE 2Degradation of racemic, (R)- and (S)-α-methylspermidine in rat liver extract in the presence of pyridoxal or benzaldehydePolyaminePutrescineSpermidineSperminepmols/mg protein2 h, 400 μm racemic MeSpd301 ± 23206 ± 27212 ± 41+ 5 mm benzaldehyde2320 ± 70166 ± 1237 ± 3+ 5 mm pyridoxal1170 ± 100247 ± 1463 ± 3+ 250 μm MDL725271821911912 h, 200 μm (R)-MeSpd261 ± 6217 ± 6169 ± 8+ 5 mm benzaldehyde2550 ± 30139 ± 2421 ± 18+ 5 mm pyridoxal350 ± 0233 ± 1255 ± 3+ 250 μm MDL72527721921792 h, 200 μm, (S)-MeSpd221 ± 0181 ± 35172 ± 29+ 5 mm benzaldehyde451 ± 69158 ± 1227 ± 6+ 5 mm pyridoxal1450 ± 69232 ± 2349 ± 2+ 250 μm MDL7252785188185 Open table in a new tab Guide Molecule-controlled Degradation of Selected Isomer from Racemic MeSpd—Based on the above data, BA and PL were chosen to investigate the oxidation of racemic MeSpd. The reaction mixtures were subjected to chiral HPLC analysis after dansylation of the polyamines. The used conditions (see “Materials and Methods”) did not yield a complete separation of distinct isomers from the reaction mixture (elution times for (S)- and (R)-MeSpd were 49.2 and 52.7 min, respectively). However, the preference for selected isomer by hPAO was clear and in the presence of BA, only traces of (R)-MeSpd were detected after 24 h. In the case of PL, (S)-MeSpd was completely oxidized after 24 h incubation (supplemental Fig. S1).The Kinetics of hPAO-dependent Oxidation of Different Enantiomers of MeSpd Supplemented with BA, PL, or P4CA—The above described experiment showed that it was possible to enrich racemic MeSpd with the preferred enantiomer by the addition of the proper aldehyde into the substrate mixture of PAO. Therefore, the kinetic parameters of hPAO-dependent oxidations of Spd, racemic, and the two enantiomers of MeSpd were determined in the presence of fixed 5 mm aldehyde concentration (Table 3). Among the tested aldehydes, BA was the most effective with Spd (kcat = 0.85 s–1) although clearly inferior to AcSpd as the substrate. This may partly be due to the reaction of aldehyde with N8-nitrogen, thus reducing the reaction rate. PL treatment provided practically the same affinity for both MeSpd isomers for hPAO, but kcat of 0.24 s–1 for (S)-MeSpd was much higher than kcat of 0.01 s–1 for (R)-MeSpd. P4CA enhanced the degradation of both isomers of MeSpd to about the same extent (Table 3).TABLE 3Kinetic characteristics of the degradation of spermidine, racemic, and different isomers of α-methylspermidine by human polyamine oxidase in the presence of different aldehydesKmKcatKcat/Kmμms-1s-1m-1AcSpd148.5610 × 103SpdNANANA+ 5 mm benzaldehyde9.40.8579 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA370.318.4 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal250.4920 × 103Racemic AcMeSpd1001.313 × 103Racemic MeSpdNANANA+ 5 mm benzaldehyde140.1913 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA550.112.0 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal310.185.8 × 103(R)-AcMeSpd959.095 × 103(R)-MeSpdNANANA+ 5 mm benzaldehyde200.6834 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA1100.181.6 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal5.90.011.7 × 103(S)-AcMeSpd1701.27.1 × 103(S)-MeSpdNANANA+ 5 mm benzaldehyde140.064.3 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA440.092.0 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal5.10.2447 × 103 Open table in a new tab Stereospecificity and Kinetics of hPAO-catalyzed Oxidation of Two Enantiomers of MeSpm and Three Diastereomers of Me2Spm Supplemented with the Key Aldehydes—Spm was a rather poor substrate for hPAO and, expectedly, aldehyde supplementation greatly increased its degradation (Table 4). In the case of MeSpm, both Spd and MeSpd were produced by hPAO, whereas only MeSpd was obtained from Me2Spm (Fig. 1). The addition of BA enhanced the reaction rates of all diastereomers of Me2Spm but PL clearly enhanced only the degradation of (S,S′)-Me2Spm (Table 4). Similarly, an addition of BA enhanced the degradation rates of both isomers of MeSpm. The presence of the methyl group did not influence the efficiency of the degradation (i.e. the cleavage of MeSpm took place at both the methylated and the nonmethylated end of the molecule). However, PL-supplementation did not enhance hPAO-mediated oxidation of (R)-MeSpm from the methylated terminus (supplemental Table S3).TABLE 4Kinetic values of spermine and different diastereomers of bis-α,α1′-methylspermine for human polyamine oxidase in the presence of different aldehydesKmkcatkcat/Kmμms-1s-1m-1AcSpm1.11715 × 106DIAcNSpm2.7197.0 × 106Spm470.48.5 × 103+ 5 mm benzaldehyde4.5122.6 × 106+ 5 mm P4CA159.6640 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal4.12.9700 × 103+ 1 mm pyridoxal3.92.7710 × 103Racemic Me2Spm471.021 × 103+ 5 mm benzaldehyde285.8210 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA1104.542 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal232.087 × 103+ 1 mm pyridoxal141.64120 × 103(R,R′)-Me2Spm550.122.2 × 103+ 5 mm benzaldehyde132.7210 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA1700.533.0 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal120.086.7 × 103+ 1 mm pyridoxal210.136.2 × 103(R,S′)-Me2Spm271.141 × 103+ 5 mm benzaldehyde214.5210 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA1104.139 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal6.61.2180 × 103+ 1 mm pyridoxal8.11.9230 × 103(S,S′)-Me2Spm160.9761 × 103+ 5 mm benzaldehyde216.1290 × 103+ 5 mm P4CA3307.824 × 103+ 5 mm pyridoxal5.72.4420 × 103+ 1 mm pyridoxal276.0220 × 103 Open table in a new tab Effect of Increasing Aldehyde Concentration on hPAO-dependent Oxidation—The reaction rates of hPAO with Spm as the substrate were enhanced upon increasing BA concentration up to 5 mm in both 100 mm glycine-NaOH and 50 mm borate buffer at high pH (supplemental Table S4). However, 10 mm BA was inhibitory for the enzyme reaction (data not shown). The reaction rate acceleration of hPAO was retarded in the presence of 2 mm or higher PL concentration when Spm or its methylated derivatives were used as the substrate (Table 5; data not shown). Therefore, we determined kinetic values for Spm derivatives with both 1 and 5 mm PL supplementation (Table 4). However, with Spd as the substrate, the reaction rate increased up to 5 mm PL (data not shown). The kinetic values of hPAO-catalyzed oxidation were measured at a constant 1 mm Spm concentration and increasing amount of supplemented aldehydes. In 100 mm glycine-NaOH, Km = 200 μm and kcat = 5.1 s–1 for PL, Km = 170 μm and kcat = 6.6 s–1 for BA, and Km = 930 μm and kcat = 6.6 s–1 values for P4CA were determined. In 50 mm borate buffer, Km = 110 μm and kcat = 3.7 s–1 forPLand Km = 150 μm, and kcat = 8.4 s–1 for BA were obtained. We also tested Me2SO in increasing concentrations as a substitute for water (24Klibanov A.M. Nature. 2001; 409: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar), but already 50% Me2SO proved to inhibit the enzyme reaction (data not shown).TABLE 5Human polyamine oxidase-catalyzed production of spermidine from spermine-pyridoxal adduct and from spermine supplemented with different amounts of pyridoxal100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.550 mm borate, pH 9.3nmol Spd1000 μm PL = Spm11.95 ± 0.3712.49 ± 0.361000 μm Spm1.09 ± 0.031.07 ± 0.05+ 100 μm pyridoxal3.64 ± 0.083.81 ± 0.04+ 500 μm pyridoxal7.92 ± 0.336.58 ± 0.12+ 1 mm pyridoxal9.01 ± 0.27ap < 0.001.7.13 ± 0.12ap < 0.001.+ 2 mm pyridoxal8.25 ± 0.18ap < 0.001.6.75 ± 0.29ap < 0.001.a p < 0.001. Open table in a new tab Effect of Incubation Order with Substrate, Aldehyde, and hPAO— Both 1 mm Spm and racemic Me2Spm were used as substrates for hPAO (0.3 and 0.6 μg/reaction, respectively) in the presence of 5 mm BA in 100 mm glycine-NaOH at pH 9.5. Two of the three components (substrate, aldehyde, and enzyme) were incubated on ice for 15 min before the addition of the third. The reactions were carried out at +37 °C for 20 min. In all of the combinations with both substrates, no differences in the reaction rates were observed (results not shown).Terminally N-substituted Polyamines as Substrates for hPAO—It is known that DENSpm is a substrate of PAO, yielding N1-ethyl-Spd as the product (25Vujcic S. Liang P. Diegelman P. Kramer D.L. Porter C.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Inclusion of either 5 mm BA or PL to DENSpm or DESpm containing substrate mixtures decreased the rate of PAO-dependent oxidation (data not shown). Furthermore, oxidation of AcSpd was inhibited by the addition of BA or PL (data not shown).Preformed Adducts of Spm with PL as Substrates for hPAO—The stock solution of the adduct was prepared by the incubation of 100 mm solution of Spm-base with 200 mm solution of PL-base in methanol in the dark at 20 °C overnight. The obtained adduct was oxidized by hPAO far more effectively than Spm supplemented with the same amount of PL (Table 5).Buffer Effect—The stereoselectivity of hPAO toward MeSpd isomers was very strict in 100 mm glycine-NaOH (Table 6) and 100 mm alanine-NaOH buffers at pH 9.5 (results not shown). Glycine and alanine as the key constituents of these buffers have the potency to react with aldehydes. Therefore, two other buffer systems were used to exclude any buffer-related effects. Stereoselectivity of hPAO was sustained in all tested buffer systems (Table 6). However, the stringency for enantiomer selection and efficacy of aldehyde-enhanced degradations differed in the studied buffers (Table 6). Moreover, aldehyde-dependent oxidation carried out at pH 7.4 (NaH2PO4 buffer) showed reduced reaction rates, but the stereoselectivity of degradation was retained (data not shown).TABLE 6Putrescine production by human polyamine oxidase from racemic, (R)- and (S)-α-methylspermidine in the presence of pyridoxal, benzaldehyde, or pyridine 4-carboxaldehydeBuffer systemRacemic MeSpd (72 nmol)(R)-MeSpd (36 nmol)(S)-MeSpd (36 nmol)RatioSupplemented with 5 mm benzaldehyde(R)/(S)50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 9.53.88.40.71250 mm borate, pH 9.36.78.51.18100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.56.514.61.114Supplemented with 5 mm pyridoxal(S)/(R)50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 9.51.2ND2.350 mm borate, pH 9.35.80.411.531100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.53.50.29.050Supplemented with 5 mm pyridine 4-carboxaldehyde(R)/(S)50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 9.52.01.50.91.650 mm borate, pH 9.30.40.30.11.9100 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 9.52.52.31.51.5 Open table in a new tab Oximes of AOE-PU—We have prepared stable oximes of AOE-PU with BA and acetone as well as AcAOE-PU (Fig. 2). These oximes may be considered as mimetics of Schiff base, which was suggested to be the substrate of the oxidation in the case of incubation of Spm or Spd with PAO in the presence of BA (26Hölttä E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). It was found that AOE-PU, like Spd, was not a substrate in the hPAO reaction. However, AcAOE-PU, which is an isoster of AcSpd, was a substrate. The kcat value of AcAOE-PU was one-fifteenth of the value for AcSpd (kcat = 0.54 and 8.5 s–1, respectively). Benzaldoxime of AOE-PU showed a good affinity for the enzyme, but the reaction rate was very low (Fig. 2) and kcat was about 5% of that obtained with Spd supplemented with 5 mm BA (Table 3). Acetone oxime of AOE-PU may be considered as a mimetic of AcSpd and showed a kcat value of one-third of the value obtained for AcAOE-PU (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Structures of N-acetylated and oxime derivatives of aminooxyethylputrescine.

The natural substrates for PAO are N1,N12-diacetylspermine, N1-acetylspermine and AcSpd (27Bolkenius F.N. Seiler N. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3), which are formed in cells as the result of acetyl-CoA-dependent acetylation of Spm and Spd by spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (28Della Ragione F.

The KdpB subunit of the prokaryotic Kdp-ATPase (KdpFABC complex) shares characteristic regions of homology with class II-IV P-type ATPases and has been shown previously to be misgrouped as a class IA P-type ATPase. Here, we present the NMR structure of the AMP-PNP-bound nucleotide binding domain KdpBN of the Escherichia coli Kdp-ATPase at high resolution. The aromatic moiety of the nucleotide is clipped into the binding pocket by Phe377 and Lys395 via a π-π stacking and a cation-π interaction, respectively. Charged residues at the outer rim of the binding pocket (Arg317, Arg382, Asp399, and Glu348) stabilize and direct the triphosphate group via electrostatic attraction and repulsion toward the phosphorylation domain. The nucleotide binding mode was corroborated by the replacement of critical residues. The conservative mutation F377Y produced a high residual nucleotide binding capacity, whereas replacement by alanine resulted in low nucleotide binding capacities and a considerable loss of ATPase activity. Similarly, mutation K395A resulted in loss of ATPase activity and nucleotide binding affinity, even though the protein was properly folded.

Ion transport is a vital prerequisite for cellular life, because ions play a crucial role in many biochemical processes, either as cofactors for enzyme function, as substrates for sym- and antiport with other substances, or maintenance of cellular pH or turgor. To maintain ion gradients across their membranes, cells employ highly sophisticated transport systems. Primary transport systems are driven by ATP to achieve transport against concentration gradients. A classic representative is the family of P-type ATPases, which play a fundamental role in the transport of heavy metal, alkali, and earth-alkali ions. Because of their enormous importance, eukaryotic P-type ATPases, such as the Ca2+-ATPase and the Na+,K+-ATPase, have been studied intensively in recent years. A major breakthrough was achieved by Toyoshima et al. (1Toyoshima C. Mizutani T. Nature. 2004; 430: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) with the elucidation of the Ca2+-ATPase structure in different reaction cycle intermediates. In addition, the structure of the nucleotide binding domain of the Na+ ,K+-ATPase was solved by x-ray crystallography (4Håkansson K.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, distantly related members of the P-type ATPase group are less well examined, and in particular, the important question of the evolutionary relationship of the different P-type ATPases remains uncertain.An unusual prokaryotic P-type ATPase, the KdpFABC complex, serves as a good model to address several questions for both mechanistic and evolutionary aspects. In Escherichia coli, the KdpFABC complex serves as a highly specific potassium transport system, which is only synthesized when the cells' need for K+ can no longer be satisfied by the constitutive K+ transport systems (5Altendorf K. Epstein W. Biomembranes (ATPases).in: Lee A.G. 5. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, London1996: 403-420Google Scholar). This P-type ATPase differs from most others by the fact that catalytic activity (KdpB) and ion transport (KdpA) are associated with two different subunits (6Bertrand J. Altendorf K. Bramkamp M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5519-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Dorus S. Mimura H. Epstein W. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5491-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For communication between KdpB and KdpA, charged residues within transmembrane helix 5 of KdpB are essential (9Bramkamp M. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8260-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit KdpB is a P-type ATPase with a unique membrane-bound region (seven transmembrane helices) and a small nucleotide binding domain (17 kDa), probably reflecting an elementary nucleotide binding mechanism. Recently, we solved the solution structure of the apo-form of the nucleotide binding domain of KdpB (KdpBN; Asn316-Gly451) by NMR spectroscopy (10Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H.

Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has been concluded that KdpBN does not show major conformational changes upon ATP binding, in contrast to previous discussions in the literature (11Kühlbrandt W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 282-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Rather, it is suggested that KdpBN undergoes a rigid body movement upon ATP binding and that it is connected to the phosphorylation domain via a flexible linker. Here, we report for the first time the atomic resolution structure of the nucleotide bound state of KdpBN based on a complete NOE data set, refining and extending the proposed model. To substantiate the role of certain residues, amino acids Phe377and Lys395 as well as Ser384 and Asp399 were substituted and their influence on ATP binding in the KdpFABC complex as well as in the isolated KdpBN domain was studied. In contrast to the previously formulated notion that KdpB belongs to type I P-type ATPases (12Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 13Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), this study corroborates that KdpB is more closely related to alkali- and earth-alkali-transporting P-type ATPases, sharing most similarities with the proton pump (type III).MATERIALS AND METHODSGrowth Conditions, Media, and Supplements—E. coli cells were routinely grown in Luria Bertani medium (14Sambrock J.

The primer pairs KdpBK395A/BamHI_rev and KdpBD399A/BamHI_rev (see supplemental Table S1) were used to create constructs carrying the point mutations K395A and D399A, respectively.

Using primer KdpBN2_for in combination with one of the mutagenesis primers KdpBF377A, KdpBF377Y, KdpBS384A, or KdpBS384T (see supplemental Table S1), PCR products were obtained carrying point mutations at positions Phe377 and Ser384, respectively. These DNA fragments were ligated via ClaI/DraIII into appropriately opened pSMC10His. Modified KdpFABC complexes were synthesized using TKW3205 cells (5Altendorf K. Epstein W.

This strain was routinely used for the expression of kdpFABC constructs, because it lacks the chromosomally encoded kdpFABC, atp, trkA, and trkD genes. Expression of the kdpFABC genes is under the control of the endogenous kdpD and kdpE gene products (6Bertrand J. Altendorf K. Bramkamp M. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5519-5522Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because not all kdpB mutants constructed enabled growth on low potassium concentrations, K+ concentrations in the millimolar range were used for induction, although the KdpD/E system triggers kdpFABC expression best below 1 mm KCl. Therefore, in these mutants, the expression of kdpFABC differed compared with wild type, which in consequence resulted in low yields of purified KdpFABC complexes. To generate modified KdpB nucleotide binding domains (KdpBN), the primer pair KdpBNfor and KdpBNrev was used to amplify the corresponding DNA fragments from the different pSMC10His derivatives carrying the point mutations described above. The resulting PCR fragments were ligated NdeI/XhoI into appropriately digested pET16b vector (Novagen). Modified KdpBN proteins were synthesized using BL21(DE3) cells carrying pLysS (Novagen). All constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (Department of Botany, University of Osnabrück, Osnabrück, Germany).Sample Preparation—KdpFABC complexes were purified by affinity chromatography via a histidine tag at the C terminus of KdpC (9Bramkamp M. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8260-8266Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 15N- and 13C-labeled KdpBN were synthesized and purified as described previously (10Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Unlabeled KdpBN was purified as described by Bramkamp and Altendorf (16Bramkamp M. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12289-12296Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).ATPase Assay—ATPase activity of purified KdpFABC complex was determined using the microtiter plate assay of Henkel et al. (17Henkel R.D. VandeBerg J.L. Walsh R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) following the modifications described previously (18Altendorf K. Gassel M. Puppe W. Möllenkamp T. Zeeck A. Boddien C. Fendler K. Bamberg E. Dröse S. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 163: 137-146Google Scholar).NMR Spectroscopy of KdpBN—The AMP-PNP-bound NMR samples used for structure determination contained 1.0 mm protein to which 10% D2O was added. A 15-fold molar excess of AMP-PNP was used. All spectra were recorded at 300 K at 600, 750, or 900 MHz on Bruker DMX600, DMX750, and DMX900 spectrometers, respectively. Sequential and side chain assignment was carried out as reported previously (19Haupt M. Coles M. Truffault V. Bramkamp M. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Distance data were derived from three-dimensional NOESY spectra, which were all measured with an 80-ms NOE mixing time. A three-dimensional 15N-HSQC-NOESY was recorded on the 15N-labeled sample, and a three-dimensional 13C-HSQC-NOESY, a CCH-NOESY, and a CNH-NOESY (20Diercks T. Coles M. Kessler H. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were recorded on the doublelabeled sample of the AMP-PNP-bound protein as well as an ω2-12C, 14N-filtered two-dimensional 13C(H)-NOESY experiment to trace intermolecular constraints (21Truffault V. Coles M. Diercks T. Abelmann K. Eberhardt S. Luttgen H. Bacher A. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 949-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Saturation transfer difference NMR experiments (22Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and WaterLOGSY experiments (23Dalvit C. Fogliatto G. Stewart A. Veronesi M. Stockman B. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) were performed on unlabeled samples of wild type and mutants F377A, F377Y, K395A, and D399A at protein concentrations of 0.5 mm and AMP-PNP concentrations of 5 mm. For the integration of the one-dimensional proton spectra of the saturation transfer difference and WaterLOGSY experiments, the exact relative sample concentration was determined by integrating over the δ-methyl signal of Leu355 at -0.2 parts/million. However, there is still a residual background from protein resonances visible in the WaterLOGSY spectra; therefore, the signal of H1′ was chosen for evaluation, as it does not overlap with protein signals. In a reference WaterLOGSY experiment, a 5 mm solution of AMP-PNP only was recorded under similar buffer conditions. This represents the nonbinding case for the specific ligand signal and thus the integral over the H1′ signal was set to -100%. All spectra were processed with X-WIN-NMR (Bruker Analytik GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) and evaluated with SPARKY software programs. 6T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, unpublished data. Integration of the one-dimensional spectra was performed with X-WINNMR.Backbone Dynamics—For R1 and R2 experiments, typically 10 relaxation delays and three duplicate points for error estimation were recorded using experiments published earlier (24Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). In the 15N dimension, 80 complex points were sampled with 48 transients and a recycle delay of 2 s between successive scans. For the heteronuclear NOE, two sets of experiments consisting of spectra with and without saturation of the amide protons were recorded. A relaxation delay between two transients of 5 s was followed by saturation of the amide protons for 3 s. Saturation was achieved by a train of 120 ° square pulses with the carrier centered in the middle of the amide region and the radio frequency amplitude set so as to achieve a null excitation at the water resonance. In the reference experiment, the pulse train was substituted by a delay of equal length. Relaxation dispersion data were recorded at B0 fields of 14.1 and 17.6 tesla using a published sequence (25Loria J.P. Rance M. Palmer A.G.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2331-2332Crossref Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 26Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11341-11352Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). For each profile, 14 experiments with different delays between the 180 ° pulses ranging from ∼600 μs to 20 ms and a total relaxation period of 80 ms were collected using 80 complex points in the 15N dimension, 48 transients, and a relaxation delay of 2 s. In addition, a reference experiment lacking the relaxation period was recorded. Peak intensities were extracted using SPARKY. Relaxation rates were obtained from fitting the intensities to an exponential decay using CURVEFIT 7A. G. Palmer, unpublished data. and the perlscript SPARKY2RATE 8J. P. Loria, unpublished data. . A minimum uncertainty of 2% for all rates was assumed. Initial guesses of the rotational diffusion tensor were obtained using QUADRIC_DIFFUSION 7A. G. Palmer, unpublished data.. Highly mobile residues or residues subject to chemical exchange were excluded from the estimation. Model-free analysis of the 15N relaxation data were achieved using MODEL-FREE 7A. G. Palmer, unpublished data. interfaced with FastMODELFREE using a published protocol (27Cole R. Loria J.P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2003; 26: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 28Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G.I. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Analysis of relaxation dispersion data was done using selfwritten scripts for SCILAB following a procedure described earlier (26Tollinger M. Skrynnikov N.R. Mulder F.A.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J.

X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar). The evaluation of NOE cross-peaks in the three-dimensional spectra was carried out as described previously (10Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Dihedral angle restraints for the backbone φ and ψ angles were derived from Cα,Cβ, and Hα chemical shifts using the program TALOS (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). Restraints were applied for the 85 high confidence predictions found by the program using the calculated range ±10 °.Coordinates—The coordinates for the structure ensemble and a regularized average structure for the AMP-PNP bound form of KdpBN have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (accession codes 2A29 and 2A00, respectively).RESULTSThree-dimensional Structure of Nucleotide-bound KdpBN—We have previously published the NMR solution structure of the apo-form of the nucleotide binding domains of KdpB termed KdpBN, together with a model of the holo-form based on data for the apo-form, which suggested that no significant conformational changes occur within the enzyme upon nucleotide binding (10Haupt M. Bramkamp M. Coles M. Altendorf K. Kessler H. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Here, we present the NMR solution structure of AMP-PNP-bound KdpBN. For the structure calculations, 1642 intramolecular NOE distance restraints were evaluated (see Table 1). Another 244 dihedral restraints were derived from chemical shift data using the program TALOS (32Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar). In addition, 24 intermolecular NOE contacts were assigned between the protein and the ligand. The resulting set of 19 final simulated annealing structures has a root mean square deviation of 0.24 Å for superimposition over backbone atoms of ordered residues (see Table 1). The enzyme consists of a six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices on each side, with a short 310-helix between helix α2 and strand β2. The minimized average structure and the superimposition of the final set of 19 structures are shown in Fig. 1.TABLE 1Structural statistics and atomic root mean square deviationsStructural statisticsRoot mean square deviation from distance restraints (Å)aNumbers in brackets indicate the number of restraints of each type.SA<SA>rAll (1666)0.023 ± 0.00080.021Intra-residue (439)0.013 ± 0.00220.012Inter-residue sequential (436)0.026 ± 0.00190.024Medium range (298)0.025 ± 0.00110.024Long range (469)0.025 ± 0.00140.023Intermolecular (24)0.036 ± 0.00500.035Root mean square deviation from dihedral restraints (244)0.086 ± 0.0100.083H-bond restraint violations (Å/°)bHydrogen bonds were restrained by treating them as pseudocovalent bonds.

Open table in a new tab Structural Consequences of Nucleotide Binding—In general, the chemical shifts of apo- and holoKdpBN show only minor differences. Shifts characteristic of secondary structure elements, Cα, Hα, and Cβ show changes that do not influence the classification of the residues according to the chemical shift index protocol (33Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1993; 4: 171-180Google Scholar). The secondary structure and the average estimated solvent accessibility of both sets of 19 structures, as determined by the program PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-289Crossref Google Scholar), are shown in Fig. 2, left panel. The only significant modification occurs to the C-terminal end of helix α1, which is extended by three residues upon nucleotide binding. The superimposition of the minimized averaged structures of the apo- and holoenzyme, shown in Fig. 2, right panel, exhibits a root mean square deviation of 1.26 Å over ordered backbone residues.FIGURE 2Structural consequences of nucleotide binding. The left panel shows the secondary structure and the average estimated solvent accessibility of both sets of 19 structures of apoKdpBN and holoKdpBN, as determined by the program PROCHECK (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut1992Google Scholar). The right panel shows a superimposition of the minimized average structures of apoKdpBN (green, PDB code 1SVJ) and holoKdpBN (blue, PDB code 2A29). Regions of interest are highlighted. Side chains of the holoenzyme are shown for selected residues. AMP-PNP is depicted in red.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A more thorough examination of the chemical shift data helps in understanding the binding mechanism. In supplemental Fig. S1, the difference of the chemical shifts of holo- to apoKdpBN of selected nuclei is plotted against the sequence. Cα, Hα, Cβ, Hβ, HN, NH, and methyl groups were evaluated. Resonances of the backbone atoms changed most noticeably in the loop region between helices α1 and α2. Helix α1 had been extended by one turn, thus Ala340, which had previously been at the C-terminal end of helix α1, was then fully integrated. The side chain of Asp344, which had previously been involved in the hydrogen bonding to Hζ of Lys395, was bent away to make way for the ligand and established a hydrogen bond to N6 of the nucleotide. The side chains of Glu348 and Arg317 were in close contact in the apoprotein (3.2 Å), but in the holoprotein, Glu348 moved aside and Arg317 then pointed toward the termini of the domain and thus toward the triphosphate group of AMP-PNP.Another part that was affected considerably was the β-sheet region spanning the binding pocket (see supplemental Fig. S1). The turn connecting strands β2 and β3 closes down by ∼15 ° on the ligand as the curved β-sheet stretches. Pro376, which shows the most intense Cα chemical shift deviation and almost identical φ/ψ angles for apo- and holo-form, represents the pivotal point in strand β2. Ser384 is the corresponding residue in strand β3. Ala379 and Arg382 are both located at the edges of the turn, their side chains pointing toward the binding pocket. The positively charged side chain of arginine stabilizes the triphosphate group of the nucleotide. The side chain of Arg317 points toward the binding pocket and forms a hydrogen bond to the triphosphate group opposite to that formed by Arg382.Chemical shifts of methyl groups are sensitive probes for structural alterations and electrostatic interactions caused by the ligand. Interestingly, the methyl carbons are hardly affected at all in contrast to the methyl protons close to aromatic systems. Significant changes in chemical shift were observed for residues in the loop region between helices α1 and α2 (see supplemental Fig. S1), as well as for Leu431 situated on strand β5; its side chain is located in proximity to the purine ring. Both methyl groups come as close as 3-4 Å to the aromatic system, explaining the strong upfield shift.Characterization of the Binding Pocket—The core of the binding pocket is dominated by neutral residues. Only one negatively charged residue, Asp344, is situated at the center and forms a hydrogen bond to the amino group of the nucleotide (N6). The only positively charged residue within the core is Lys395, forming a cation-π-stacking interaction to the six-membered part of the purine ring of AMP-PNP. Two positively charged residues, Arg317 and Arg382, are situated diametrically opposed to each other on the outer rim of the binding pocket (Fig. 3a). Both form hydrogen bonds to the triphosphate group of the nucleotide and orient it toward the phosphorylation domain. Somewhat further away (6-8 Å) are two negatively charged residues, Glu348 and Asp399. They are also diametrically opposed to each other, and their axis forms an angle of ∼45 ° with respect to the axis defined by Arg317 and Arg382 (Fig. 3b). These residues may provide stabilization by electrostatic repulsion within a certain range of flexibility. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions between the protein and the ligand are established by Ser384 and N1 of AMP-PNP. Most residues in the binding pocket are, however, hydrophobic. The most important interaction is established by Phe377, which exhibits a π-π stacking with the nucleotide, whereas Leu431 approaches the five-membered ring of AMP-PNP from the other side.FIGURE 3Characteristic properties of the nucleotide binding pocket. a, Phe377 and Lys395 form the central part of the binding pocket, helping the aromatic residue to orient accordingly. b, the surface representation of the entire protein visualizes the charge distribution in the enzyme. Asp344 forms an H-bond to the amino group of the purine ring in the otherwise hydrophobic bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2089657090,"The human transferrin receptor (TfR) is shed by an integral metalloprotease releasing a soluble form (sTfR) into serum. The sTfR reflects the iron demand of the body and is postulated as a regulator of iron homeostasis via binding to the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE. To study the role of transferrin in this process, we investigated TfR shedding in HL60 cells and TfR-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human TfR. Independent of TfR expression, sTfR release decreases with increasing ferritransferrin concentrations, whereas apo-transferrin exhibits no inhibitory effect. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we generated several TfR mutants with different binding affinities for transferrin. Shedding of TfR mutants in transfected cells correlates exactly with their binding affinity, implying that the effect of ferritransferrin on TfR shedding is mediated by a direct molecular interaction. Analysis of sTfR release from purified microsomal membranes revealed that the regulation is independent from intracellular trafficking or cellular signaling events. Our results clearly demonstrated that sTfR does not only reflect the iron demand of the cells but also the iron availability in the bloodstream, mirrored by iron saturation of transferrin, corroborating the important potential function of sTfR as a regulator of iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1973891075,"The degradation of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (EC 4.1.1.17) by 26 S proteasome, is accelerated by the ODC antizyme (AZ), a trigger protein involved in the specific degradation of eukaryotic ODC. In prokaryotes, AZ has not been found. Previously, we found that in Selenomonas ruminantium, a strictly anaerobic and Gram-negative bacterium, a drastic degradation of lysine decarboxylase (LDC; EC 4.1.1.18), which has decarboxylase activities toward both l-lysine and l-ornithine with similar Km values, occurs upon entry into the stationary phase of cell growth by protease together with a protein of 22 kDa (P22). Here, we show that P22 is a direct counterpart of eukaryotic AZ by the following evidence. (i) P22 synthesis is induced by putrescine but not cadaverine. (ii) P22 enhances the degradation of both mouse ODC and S. ruminantium LDC by a 26 S proteasome. (iii) S. ruminantium LDC degradation is also enhanced by mouse AZ replacing P22 in a cell-free extract from S. ruminantium.

Therefore, no antizymes or direct counterparts of eukaryote antizymes have been found in prokaryotes so far. Previously, we found cadaverine covalently linked to the peptidoglycan in Selenomonas ruminantium, a strictly anaerobic bacterium, as an essential constituent of the peptidoglycan to maintain the integrity of the cell envelope of this strain. We also found that cadaverine is synthesized constitutively from l-lysine catalyzed by LDC (EC 4.1.1.18) and transferred to the d-glutamic acid residue of the lipid intermediate for synthesis of the peptidoglycan by a lipid intermediate: cadaverine transferase (7.Kamio Y.

(i) S. ruminantium LDC consists of two identical monomeric subunits of 45 kDa each and decarboxylates both l-lysine and l-ornithine with similar Km and Vmax values; its decarboxylating activities toward both substrates were completely prevented by dl-α-difluoromethyl ornithine, a compound previously shown to be a specific inhibitor of eukaryotic ODC (14.Pösö H.

(ii) The amino acid sequence of S. ruminantium LDC is 35% identical and 53–60% similar to those of eukaryotic ODCs; 26 amino acid residues, all of which are implicated either in contributing to pyridoxal phosphate- and substrate-binding domains or in formation of the homodimeric forms of eukaryotic ODCs, are conserved in S. ruminantium LDC (13.Takatsuka Y. Yamaguchi Y. Ono M. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). (iii) S. ruminantium LDC has a sequence homologous to that of the mouse AZ binding region in mouse ODC. (iv) S. ruminantium LDC is classified as a fold type III protein similar to eukaryotic ODCs but not to bacterial ODC or other LDCs. In addition, S. ruminantium has no typical ODC with decarboxylase activity exclusively toward l-ornithine (12.Takatsuka Y. Onoda M. Sugiyama T. Muramoto K. Tomita T. Kamio Y. Biosci. Biotechnol.

These findings show that S. ruminantium LDC and eukaryotic ODC resemble each other in both biochemical and biophysical characteristics except for the broad substrate specificity of S. ruminantium LDC. The production of LDC in S. ruminantium is highly regulated and is strictly linked to the growth phase (i.e. a drastic decrease in LDC activity occurs upon entry into the stationary phase of cell growth, which is due to the rapid degradation of LDC) (12.Takatsuka Y. Onoda M. Sugiyama T. Muramoto K. Tomita T. Kamio Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the current work, we isolated a new protein of 22 kDa (P22), which is induced in putrescine-grown cells as a regulating factor for the degradation of LDC in S. ruminantium cells by a protease whose activity requires ATP (15.Yamaguchi Y. Takatsuka Y. Kamio Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that P22 is a direct counterpart of mammalian ODC AZ for the degradation of S. ruminantium LDC by a protease that requires ATP for its activity. In this study, we also show that P22 is a constituent of the ribosome of S. ruminantium. DNA sequence analysis shows that P22 exhibits 47% identity and 60–66% similarity in amino acid sequence compared with those of the reported ribosomal L10 proteins of bacteria. Materials—Plasmid vectors, pMW119 and pET15b, were purchased from Nippon gene (Tokyo, Japan) and Novagen (Madison, WI), respectively. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase and TaqDNA polymerase, were from Takara (Otsu, Japan). HiTrap chelating HP column, Hybond ECL membrane, and Redivue™ Pro-mix™ l-[35S] in vitro labeling mix containing 35S-labeled l-methionine and 35S-labeled l-cysteine (37 TBq/mmol), were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. A 26 S proteasome was obtained from Immatics Biotechnologies (Tübingen, Germany). An anti-ubiquitin antibody was from Hokudo (Sapporo, Japan). Creatine kinase and Freund's complete adjuvant were from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Fc)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate was a product of Promega (Madison, WI). The Biacore X instrument, the CM5 sensor chip, and the reagents for the surface plasmon resonance experiments were all delivered by Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer and ABI PRIZM BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—The strains used in the present study included S. ruminantium ssp. lactilytica (16.Kanegasaki S. Takahashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 456-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli BL21(DE3), which were used as the host strains. Culture media included a tryptone-yeast extract-glucose medium (16.Kanegasaki S. Takahashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 456-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and L broth for the growth of S. ruminantium and E. coli strains, respectively. S. ruminantium was grown under the anaerobic conditions described previously (16.Kanegasaki S. Takahashi H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 456-463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cloning of the P22 Structural Gene from Chromosomal DNA of S. ruminantium—The chromosomal DNA of S. ruminantium, which was isolated and purified by standard methods, was digested by various restriction endonucleases, and resultant fragments were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with the fluorescein-labeled DNA probe 5′-AARGAYCARNNNACNAAYGCNAARGG-3′; this probe was synthesized based on the known N-terminal amino acid sequence, 15KDQXTNAKG23 of the pure P22 protein (in the sequence of the probe, R, N, and Y represent A or G; A, G, C, or T; and C or T, respectively). The screening of a PstI library of the S. ruminantium chromosomal DNA gave a single positive clone from ∼100,000 colonies. The positive clone contained an insert of 912 bp whose sequence encoded the N-terminal region but not the full-length P22 protein. Therefore, to obtain the full-length p22 coding sequence, S. ruminantium chromosomal DNA was digested with EcoRI or HindIII, followed by self-ligation with T4 DNA ligase. The self-ligated and circularized DNA fragments were used as templates for amplification of the p22 gene by PCR with two primers (P917-Fw, 5′-ATTTCATCGGAACCAACGAAGTCTGCA-3′; P917-Rv, 5′-TGAACTTCGCGCCGCTGGTGTAACGTA-3′) reading outward from the known sequence of the p22 gene. The amplified product (6,041 bp from the EcoRI digest or 4,050 bp from the HindIII digest) was purified by agarose electrophoresis and inserted into the corresponding EcoRI or HindIII sites of the pMW119 vector. The DNA sequencing of the cloned fragments was done using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer with an ABI PRIZM BigDye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit. Homology Searches, Identification of ORFs, and Multiple Sequence Alignments of the Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequences—Protein and nucleotide sequences were compared with the sequence data base using the BLAST (version 2.0) programs implemented at the EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ nucleotide sequence data base. Open reading frame (ORF) identification and multiple sequence alignments were performed using the GENETYX program (Software development Co., Tokyo, Japan). Construction of a Plasmid for P22 Expression in a T7 Promoter-dependent Expression System—For expression of recombinant P22 (rP22), a DNA fragment containing only the p22 structural gene was amplified from the chromosomal DNA by PCR using primers 5′-TTTCATATGGCAAATATG ACGAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTGGATCCTTATGCGGATTCCTTCTGAGCGCGAACAGCG-3′ (single and double underlined sequences represent the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites), which are located upstream and downstream of p22, respectively. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI, and the NdeI-BamHI fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of an expression vector pET15b with an N-terminal His tag sequence to construct plasmid pEP22, in which p22 was under the control of the T7 promoter. Isolation and Purification of a His-tagged Recombinant P22 Protein from E. coli BL21(pE22k)—Cells of E. coli BL21(pE22k) were grown in LB (1% Bacto tryptone, 0.5% Bacto yeast extract, 1% NaCl) medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking to an optical density of 0.6 at 660 nm; isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added at a final concentration of 1.0 mm, followed by incubation with shaking for an additional 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and disrupted in a French pressure cell. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g, and the precipitate was dissolved in 50 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8, buffer A) containing 6 m urea. The crude extract thus obtained was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied a 1-ml HiTrap chelating HP column preloaded with nickel sulfate and equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column extensively with buffer A, His-tagged P22 was eluted from the column with buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole, and the eluate was dialyzed for a total of 36 h at 4 °C against 80 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing successive concentrations of urea, at 4, 2, 1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, and 0 m urea, continuously. As a final step, the sample was dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C for 4 h to obtain a clear sample. The N-terminal amino acid residues of the purified, recombinant P22 preparation were identical with those expected from the expression plasmid sequence. Preparation of Anti-P22 Antiserum—Mouse antiserum raised against recombinant P22 was prepared by the following method. One ml of the purified P22 (1 mg/ml) was emulsified with 1 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously into a female BALB/C mouse. Two weeks later, a second injection of the recombinant protein emulsified with Freud's incomplete adjuvant was given in the same way, followed by four additional injections every 2 weeks. Two weeks after the seventh injection, the mouse was anesthetized and killed for preparation of antiserum. Construction of Plasmids for Expression of S. ruminantium LDC and Its Mutants and for E. coli Ribosomal Protein L10—Expression of plasmids for LDC and its mutants and for E. coli ribosomal protein L10 (RplJ) was generated from vector pET15b. The plasmid pELDC to express wild type LDC was constructed from pTLDC (13.Takatsuka Y. Yamaguchi Y. Ono M. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) by PCR, using the primers 5′-TTTTTTCATATGAAAA ATTTCAGACTTAG-3′ and 5′-ATATCCGGATCCATGCATCTGCAGTAATCCAGCTCCTGCA-3′ (single and double underlined sequences represent the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively). The coding sequence for the LDC mutant in which the Lys103, Lys123, and Lys126 residues are replaced by Ala residues was constructed by an overlapping-extension method (17.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 18.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar), using three pairs of oligonucleotide primers, KARv (5′-GTCAGCCGCCGCAGCCGCGAGGCCACGGGC-3′) and KAFw (5′-GGCCTCGCTGCTGCGGCTGA-3′), KKAAFw (5′-CGGAAATCGACGCGATGGCCGCGGCTGTGCCG-3′) and KKAARv (5′-CCCGGCACAGCCGCGGCCATCGCGTCGATTTCCG-3′), and T7Fw (5′-TAATACGACTCACTGTA-3′) and T7Rv (5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGG-3′). Mutations in each of the amplified products were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The E. coli ribosomal protein L10 gene was amplified from E. coli chromosomal DNA by PCR, using the primers 5′-TTTTTTCATATGGCTTTAAATCTTCAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTTTGGATCCTTAAGCAGCTTCTTTCGC-3′ (single and double underlined sequences represent the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively). Recombinant LDC proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by induction at A660 = 0.6 with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h and purified by a HiTrap chelating HP column using a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 500 mm NaCl. LDC and its mutants were eluted in a fraction containing ∼150 mm imidazole. Recombinant E. coli ribosomal protein L10 (RplJ) was expressed and purified by the same method as that for rP22 purification. Assay for rP22 Binding to LDC—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed with a Biacore X biosensor system at a sensor temperature of 25 °C. The His-tagged LDC preparation and bovine serum albumin were coupled to different flow cells of a sensor chip (CM5 research grade) via standard N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide activation. Ethanolamine was then injected to quench the unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide groups. The mobile phase buffer used was HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P-20). Analytes were injected at various concentrations, and the bound analytes were removed by washing with buffer 180 s after the injection. Data were analyzed with BIAevaluation (version 3.0) software using the global fitting model. Equilibrium dissociation constant values (KD) were calculated from the steady-state resonance unit (1 resonance unit = 1 ng/mm2) binding signal. Inhibitory Effects of P22 and Mouse AZ on the S. ruminantium LDC Activity—Mouse AZ preparation was purified by the method described previously (19.Saito T. Hascilowicz T. Ohkido I. Kikuchi Y. Okamoto H. Hayashi S. Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purified P22 or mouse AZ preparation was added to a reaction mixture containing 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm pyridoxal phosphate and either the purified S. ruminantium LDC or a mouse ODC preparation. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 0 °C, and then the remaining LDC or ODC activity was measured by the method described previously (12.Takatsuka Y. Onoda M. Sugiyama T. Muramoto K. Tomita T. Kamio Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1063-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20.Phan A.P.H. Ngo T.T. Lenhoff H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 120: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Degradation Rate of LDC Protein—The rate of degradation of the LDC protein was determined by measuring the decay of radiolabeled LDC. S. ruminantium cells were anaerobically grown overnight at 37 °C in a chemically defined medium (21.Linehan B. Scheifinger C.C. Wolin M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1978; 35: 317-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) lacking methionine. The culture was diluted 100-fold with TYG medium and incubated again at 37 °C. When the cell density reached 5 × 108 or 1.8 × 109 cells/ml, 37 MBq/ml l-[35S]methionine was added to the culture, and the incubation was continued. After 10 min, 2 mm cold l-methionine and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) was added to the cultures, and the incubation was continued. At 15-min intervals, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and boiled in 1% SDS in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). After centrifuging at 100,000 × g, the supernatants were diluted 100-fold and incubated with anti-LDC antiserum at 4 °C for 1 h and then shaken with Protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The mixture was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 min. The precipitate was washed four times each with 1 ml of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then resuspended and boiled with solubilizing buffer for SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and the band corresponding to LDC was visualized by autoradiography. The degradation rate was calculated by measuring the radioisotope incorporated into LDC using Image Gauge (version 3.0) software. The percentage degradation of LDC was calculated from the ratio of the remaining amount of LDC to the amount of LDC at time 0. Depletion of S. ruminantium P22 from Cell Extracts for Subsequent Protease Assays—The S. ruminantium cells were grown in TYG medium until the cell density reached 1.6–2.6 × 109/ml (at early stationary phase). To remove endogenous P22, S. ruminantium cell extract (200 μg of protein) was incubated in a reaction mixture (200 μl) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and anti-P22 antiserum in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, at 4 °C for 60 min. Protein G-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl of a 50% slurry) was then added to the sample followed by incubation for 2 h at 4° C. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was obtained. The removal of P22 from the supernatant was confirmed by immunoassay. Preparation of 35S-Labeled LDC and Mouse ODC—35S-Labeled LDC and mouse ODC were prepared by the method described by Zhang et al. (22.Zhang M. Pickart C.M. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1488-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). LDC or Mouse ODC Degradation Assay in Vitro—Degradation of LDC in the P22-free extract was carried out with or without rP22 in a basal reaction mixture (Mixture A), which contained 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and P22-free extract (136 ng) in a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixture was treated with SDS (2%) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (2%) at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The proteins on the gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL) and then incubated with anti-LDC antiserum. The antigen-antibody complex was detected with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Fc)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Bands were visualized with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrate. The intensity of the LDC bands was quantitated using the NIH Image 1.61 program. Relative amounts of the remaining LDC protein were expressed as a percentage of the starting amount. For the degradation of S. ruminantium LDC by mouse AZ or RplJ in Mixture A, AZ (500 nm) or RplJ (600 nm) was used. For the degradation of S. ruminantium LDC in 26 S proteasome, which was confirmed to be free from ubiquitin (Ub) using anti-Ub antibody, the basal reaction mixture (Mixture B) contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 5 μg of creatine kinase, 0.1 mm cycloheximide, 50 nm [35S]LDC, and 20 μg of 26 S proteasome in a total volume of 100 μl. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C by incubating Mixture B with AZ (500 nm), P22 (500 nm), AZ plus P22 plus MG132. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The radioactivity of bands corresponding to LDC was measured and quantified with Image Gauge (version 3.0). The degradation of mouse ODC in S. ruminantium P22-free extracts and in 26 S proteasome was done using 35S-labeled mouse ODC preparation (40 nm). Preparation of a Ribosome Fraction from S. ruminantium and E. coli—Ribosomes were prepared from S. ruminantium cells at log phase. The cells were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer A) and sonicated. After cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 2 h at 4° C. The precipitate thus obtained was resuspended in the same buffer and layered over an equal volume of a 1.1 m sucrose cushion made up in Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 17 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NH4Cl, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (buffer B) and then dialyzed against the same buffer for 6 h at 4°C. One hundred fifty μl of the dialyzed sample was layered on 11 ml of 10–30% linear sucrose gradient prepared in buffer B and centrifuged at 50,500 × g for 16 h at 4 °C using a Beckman SW40.2Ti rotor. The contents were fractionated and subjected to Western blotting analysis using anti-P22 antiserum. Miscellaneous—Protein was measured by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the P22 preparation were determined by the methods described previously (13.Takatsuka Y. Yamaguchi Y. Ono M. Kamio Y. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6732-6741Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out by the method described previously (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number—The nucleotide sequences of the p22 gene and seven open reading frames have been deposited in the GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ data bases under accession number AB100500. Nucleotide Sequence of the S. ruminantium P22 Gene and Its Flanking Region—The determined 8.5-kbp sequence included eight ORFs (Fig. 1). ORF1 encoded a 179-amino acid protein of 19,312 Da whose N-terminal sequence matched that determined for the purified P22 protein. The p22 gene, spanning positions 3744–4283 within the cloned genomic sequence, started with an ATG codon and ended with a TAA stop codon. Putative –35 (TTGATA) and –10 (TATTGT) sequences were found 140 and 114 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of p22, respectively. Eleven base pairs upstream from the ATG codon, a ribosomal binding site consensus sequence (AGGAGG) was found at positions 3727–3733. No termination loop was found downstream of the TAA stop codon. Functional Analysis of the p22 Gene Product—To prove that p22 is the gene encoding S. ruminantium P22, the cloned sequence was expressed in E. coli; the recombinant P22 (rP22) was purified, and its characteristics were compared with those of the earlier P22 protein preparation (15.Yamaguchi Y. Takatsuka Y. Kamio Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 1431-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(pE22) expressed P22 at a final concentration of ∼2% of its total protein. The purified rP22 protein had characteristics identical to those of the native P22 protein, as judged by the apparent molecular mass (22 kDa) determined by SDS-PAGE and its degradation-promoting activity for S. ruminantium LDC. The degradation of LDC in P22-free extract was not observed (Fig. 3A). Thus, we concluded that ORF1 is the p22 gene of S. ruminantium. Amino Acid Sequence Homologies of P22 with Bacterial Ribosomal Protein L10—The amino acid sequence of S. ruminantium P22 showed 47% identity and ∼60–66% similarity to bacterial ribosomal L10 proteins from Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus halodurans (25.Shimizu T. Ohtani K. Hirakawa H. Ohshima K. Yamashita A. Shiba T. Ogasawara N. Hattori M. Kuhara S. Hayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the two ORFs (ORF2 and ORF3 in Fig. 1) just upstream of p22, consisting of 423 and 678 nucleotides, which are tentatively called protein 2 and protein 3, respectively, and one ORF (ORF4 in Fig. 1), consisting of 366 nucleotides, which is tentatively called protein 4, just downstream of the p22 gene were found. The amino acid sequences of proteins 2–4 exhibited 75, 62, and 67% overall identity with those of L11, L1, and L7/L12, respectively, of the aforementioned three bacteria (25.Shimizu T. Ohtani K.

https://openalex.org/W2046459903,"Most cytoplasmic mRNAs are decapped and digested by the 5′–3′-exonuclease Xrn1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The activity of Xrn1p is naturally inhibited in the presence of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (pAp), a metabolite produced during sulfate assimilation that is quickly metabolized to AMP by the enzymatic activity of Hal2p. However, pAp accumulates and 5′–3′ degradation decreases in the presence of ions known to inhibit Hal2p activity, such as sodium or lithium. We have shown that yeast cells can better adapt to the presence of sodium than lithium because of their ability to reduce pAp accumulation by activating HAL2 expression in a Gcn4p-dependent response, a regulatory loop that is likely to be conserved in different yeast species. We have thus identified a new role for the transcriptional activity of Gcn4p in maintaining an active mRNA degradation pathway under conditions of sodium stress. Since deregulation of proteins involved in different metabolic pathways is observed in xrn1Δ mutants, the maintenance of mRNA degradation capacity is likely to be important for the accurate and rapid adaptation of gene expression to salt stress.

Although the study of gene regulation has traditionally focused on transcription as a major regulator of gene expression, it has recently become apparent that the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression may play an equally important role (1Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Xrn1p is a major player in this post-transcriptional control in yeast because it is responsible for the turnover of the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs (2Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This role is evident in both the general deadenylation-dependent mRNA decay (3Larimer F.W. Hsu C.L. Maupin M.K. Stevens A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 120: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 4Decker C.J. Parker R. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1994; 370: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Xrn1p is not essential, but XRN1 deletion mutants grow slowly, and mutations in XRN1 are known to have pleiotropic effects (6Kearsey S. Kipling D. Trends Cell.

Since Xrn1p acts at the last step in mRNA turnover, after decapping, xrn1 mutants accumulate decapped intermediates (2Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 855-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) that can persist in polysomes (7Caponigro G. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2421-2432Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 8He F. Peltz S.W. Donahue J.L. Rosbash M. Jacobson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7034-7038Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). This defect is potentially detrimental to cellular fitness, through an inability to remove decapped transcripts from the translation machinery in a timely fashion. An analysis of global protein expression in xrn1Δ mutant strains revealed both up- and down-regulation of different sets of proteins involved in several metabolic pathways (9Ross P.L. Huang Y.N. Marchese J.N. Williamson B. Parker K. Hattan S. Khainovski N. Pillai S. Dey S. Daniels S. Purkayastha S. Juhasz P. Martin S. Bartlet-Jones M. He F. Jacobson A. Pappin D.J. Mol. Cell.

Such alterations in gene expression would certainly be problematic under conditions of environmental stress, when cells are required to establish a particular gene expression program for adaptation. It has been demonstrated that inhibition of 5′–3′-exoribonuclease activity by the metabolite, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate (pAp), 3The abbreviations used are: pAp, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; ApS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; GCRE, Gcn4p-response element; SD, synthetic minimum medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; WT, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: pAp, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate; ApS, adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole; GCRE, Gcn4p-response element; SD, synthetic minimum medium; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; WT, wild type. occurs in the presence of toxic ions such as sodium and lithium (10Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). pAp is produced during the assimilation of sulfate, an essential process in all living organisms. Sulfate assimilation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is initiated by the production of adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (ApS) from ATP and sulfate (11Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ApS yields 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (pApS), which is then reduced to sulfite and pAp. Sulfite is reduced further to sulfide, which is incorporated into homocysteine, which in turn can be metabolized to methionine (12Thomas D. Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3292-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The product of the HAL2/MET22 gene is required for the dephosphorylation of pAp to AMP, but the presence of sodium or lithium in the growth medium inhibits the enzymatic activity of Hal2p and causes accumulation of pAp (13Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Part of the salt toxicity is known to be due to the accumulation of pAp since sodium or lithium toxicity in cells can be efficiently relieved by overexpression of Hal2p, which limits pAp accumulation (10Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 14Glaser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Similarly, the presence of extracellular methionine, which limits sulfate assimilation and consequently pAp accumulation, is known to increase salt tolerance (10Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 16Cherest H. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Robichon-Szulmajster H. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 106: 758-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Many metabolic activities are sensitive to salt inhibition, but cells counter the accumulation of toxic ions in the cytoplasm by homeostatic mechanisms, which maintain intracellular ion concentrations and are essential for living cells (17Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Serrano R. Mulet J.M. Rios G. Marquez J.A. de Larrinoa I.F. Leube M.P. Mendizabal I. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Ros R. Montesinos C. J. Exp. Bot. 1999; 50: 1023-1036Crossref Google Scholar). For instance, many strains of the yeast S. cerevisiae contain a major sodium and lithium extrusion ATPase encoded by the ENA1–4/PMR2 gene cluster (19Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 20Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Extrusion of toxic ions, such as sodium or lithium (lithium being a sodium analog with higher toxicity), occurs efficiently in cells and affords salt tolerance, although it does not efficiently prevent pAp accumulation under high salt conditions. Degradation of the body of mRNAs has already been extensively studied in terms of the effect of mutations in trans-acting factors or cis-acting elements on mRNA stability (21Parker R. Song H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), but only a few investigations into how external stimuli regulate global mRNA turnover have been pursued in S. cerevisiae. One example of specific effects comes from studies of the target of rapamycin pathway, which senses external nutrient availability and mediates changes in gene expression upon diauxic shift (22Crespo J.L. Hall M.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 579-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) by controlling the turnover of specific mRNAs (23Albig A.R. Decker C.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3428-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The best-studied mRNAs in terms of a context-specific regulation of RNA stability are mammalian transcripts containing AU-rich elements, also observed in a few yeast transcripts (24Vasudevan S. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We are only just beginning to learn how many RNA-binding proteins associated with these AU-rich elements modulate mRNA decay in response to environmental stimuli (1Wilusz C.J. Wilusz J. Trends Genet. 2004; 20: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 25Shim J. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 14: 323-331Google Scholar). Gcn4p is a transcriptional activator of hundreds of genes in response to many different stress or starvation conditions (26Natarajan K. Meyer M.R. Jackson B.M. Slade D. Roberts C. Hinnebusch A.G. Marton M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4347-4368Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar, 27Hinnebusch A.G. Natarajan K. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Adaptation to changes in the extracellular environment is a critical event for cell survival, and the activation of GCN4 expression in the presence of NaCl may contribute to the well known ability of yeast to adapt to extreme perturbations in culture conditions. The study we describe here has provided the first evidence that Gcn4p mediates the regulation of mRNA degradation in response to external stimuli. We demonstrated that cells take advantage of the derepression of GCN4 translation in the presence of sodium to maintain the degradation activity of 5′–3′-exonucleases. We have shown that Gcn4p participates directly in the activation of HAL2 expression, thus permitting the limitation of pAp accumulation. In cells deficient in the 3′–5′-mRNA decay pathway, we have shown that cells unable to maintain Gcn4p-dependent 5′–3′-mRNA degradation activity display severe growth defects in the presence of salt. Strains and Media—Yeast were grown in media based on Hartwell's synthetic complete or synthetic minimum medium (SD) as described elsewhere (28Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). For cell cultures, minimal medium SD was completed with tryptophan, isoleucine, arginine, valine, lysine, leucine, histidine, adenine, and uracil in concentrations based on Hartwell's synthetic complete media to minimize GCN4 expression. Uracil was omitted to keep selection for plasmids p16, p238, p180, and p227 when present in cells. Histidine was omitted in liquid cultures treated with the anti-metabolite 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) at a final concentration of 10 or 50 mm as indicated. The GCN4 and HAL1 null alleles were obtained by one-step gene replacement using PCR fragments of the KanMX gene, amplified with long primers containing 5′ and 3′ sequences of GCN4 and HAL1, respectively (29Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). In the same way, the sequence of the potential Gcn4p-binding site 5′-TGACTC (which we call GCRE for Gcn4p-response element) was modified by insertion of the KanMX gene upstream to create the new sequence 5′-TGTCGC. Plasmids—In this study, we used plasmid p16 (URA3 CEN) and plasmid p238, which overproduces Gcn4p constitutively (GCN4c URA3 CEN) (30Rolfes R.J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5099-5111Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Plasmids p180 and p227 contain the GCN4-lacZ fusion with or without the four upstream open reading frames, respectively, and have been described previously (31Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 32Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These plasmids were generous gifts from A. Hinnebusch. Yeast transformations were performed by the LiAc procedure (28Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Preparation of Yeast Nucleotide Extracts and HPLC Analysis—Yeast nucleotide extracts and HPLC analysis were done as described previously with minor modifications (13Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29029-29033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to an absorbance of 0.2 at 600 nm and then treated with LiCl or NaCl at the indicated concentrations. At the indicated times, samples corresponding to 20 OD600 nm (2.108 cells) were harvested by filtration through Millipore filters (0.45 μm) and extracted with 1 ml of 2 n perchloric acid at 0 °C for 15 min. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 3 min. 0.8 ml of supernatant were neutralized with 0.36 ml of 2 n KOH and 4 m H2PO4 and centrifuged as above. Supernatants were filtered through Millipore HV filters (0.45 μm) and stored at –80 °C. 100 μl of each extract were analyzed by HPLC (Waters). Samples were applied to a reversed phase C18 column (Lichrosphere 100, 4 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, Merck), eluted, and detected as described (33Lim C.K. Peters T.J. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 461: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nucleotide peaks were identified by co-injection with standards (AMP, ADP, ATP, and pAp from Sigma). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted as described (34Benard L. Carroll K. Valle R.C. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2688-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) from 10 ml of cell cultures grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase and after NaCl treatment when indicated. 20 μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1.25% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The size-fractionated RNA was blotted onto a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridization was performed as recommended by the supplier. Probes against scR1 RNAs were generated by the random priming method, using PCR products as templates. Amplification of genomic scR1 was performed using oligonucleotides obc13 (5′-GGTGGGATGGGATACGTTG) and obc14 (5′-CGGCCACAATGTGCGAG). The probe AJO130, specific for ITS1 (35Johnson A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6122-6130Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), was end-labeled by polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from 20 ml of cell cultures grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase and after NaCl treatment for an additional 2 h as indicated. Western blot experiments were performed using rabbit anti-Hal2p (14Glaser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 40 mg of total proteins were loaded and separated by electrophoresis on 12% acrylamide gels as described (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207023) Google Scholar). Transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotting with antibody (diluted 5000×) were performed as described (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (diluted 5000×), SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and Kodak X-Omat AR films. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase and treated with 3-AT, NaCl, LiCl, or KCl treatment for an additional 2 h as indicated. Whole-cell extracts were prepared as described elsewhere (38Rose M. Botstein D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 167-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), except that Z buffer without β-mercaptoethanol was used as the extraction buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad assay, and β-galactosidase activity was measured as described (39Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase units are expressed in nanomoles of 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside hydrolyzed per minute per nanogram of protein. Sodium Stimulates GCN4 Expression More Efficiently than Lithium—It has been demonstrated previously that lithium treatment of wild type yeast strains results in strong inhibition of both Xrn1p and Rat1p 5′–3′-exonuclease activities (10Dichtl B. Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Lithium inhibition of Hal2p, a specific phosphatase that breaks down pAp, causes increased cellular levels of pAp, a direct inhibitor of Xrn1p and Rat1p. Although both lithium and sodium are inhibitors of Hal2p, lithium shows higher levels of toxicity and can be used as a growth inhibitor at lower concentrations than sodium (19Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because NaCl stress was also shown to induce the general amino acid control response (40Goossens A. Dever T.E. Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30753-30760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 41Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22820-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we asked whether LiCl could have a similar effect. Stimulation of GCN4 translation occurs via a mechanism involving four short upstream open reading frames located in the 5′-non-coding region of the GCN4 mRNA. Since Gcn2p-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α is a prerequisite for the induction of GCN4 translation in response to histidine starvation or NaCl stress, we used a GCN4-lacZ translational fusion containing all four upstream open reading frames in cells expressing wild type or a mutant form of GCN2 to measure and compare GCN4 translation in the presence and absence of LiCl (Table 1, p180 plasmid). As controls for GCN4 derepression, Gcn4-lacZ enzyme activity was also measured upon histidine starvation, mimicked by the addition of 3-AT, and in the presence of sodium (Table 1, 0.2 m NaCl or 0.4 m NaCl). Although NaCl and 3-AT caused a significant increase in β-galactosidase levels, as expected (32Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 41Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22820-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), LiCl had a much smaller effect (Table 1). All increases were essentially abolished in cells deficient for Gcn2p activity (gcn2-1 mutant). As shown previously, the activation by NaCl was not observed in the presence of KCl (Table 1, 0.5 m KCl), suggesting that this effect is not due to a general osmotic stress response (41Narasimhan J. Staschke K.A. Wek R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22820-22832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also analyzed the expression of a mutant GCN4-lacZ fusion under the same conditions. In this fusion, the four upstream open reading frames are non-functional, thus alleviating translational control (Table 1, p227 plasmid). With this construct, Gcn4-lacZ enzyme activity was elevated in all conditions and independent of Gcn2p. Thus, exposure of cells to LiCl causes only a weak translational activation of GCN4, slightly greater than that observed in the presence of KCl but significantly lower than the induction by histidine starvation or sodium stress. This implies that, although lithium has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of Hal2p activity, sodium is more efficient at activating GCN4 expression.TABLE 1Exposure to elevated levels of Na+, not Li+, enhances GCN4 translational expressionGCN2 allelePlasmidaPlasmid p180 contains GCN4-lacZ with the four 0RFs in 5′-non-coding region of GCN4.

Stevens A. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7184-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we asked whether the sodium-induced expression of GCN4 might somehow limit pAp accumulation. We performed HPLC analysis of nucleotide extracts from control and LiCl-treated or NaCl-treated wild type cells. As observed previously, a nucleotide peak corresponding to pAp accumulated after treatment of cells with LiCl (WT, 0.2 m LiCl) for 1 h when compared with untreated cells (WT, SD) (Fig. 2). Incubation of cells in the presence of 0.4 m NaCl for the same period did not increase the intracellular pAp concentrations to detectable levels (WT, 0.4 m NaCl). This is due in part to the much greater inhibition of Hal2p by lithium than sodium (15Murguia J.R. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Science. 1995; 267: 232-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Detectable levels of pAp were visible, however, in NaCl-treated cells lacking GCN4, suggesting that GCN4 indeed limits pAp accumulation (Fig. 2, gcn4Δ 0.4 m NaCl). The effect of the gcn4Δ mutation was only visible in the presence of salt since no pAp accumulated in this mutant in the absence of NaCl (gcn4Δ, SD). To confirm that GCN4 expression inhibits the accumulation of pAp, we compared pAp levels in LiCl-treated wild type cells, in which pAp levels are high, with cells bearing a GCN4c constitutive allele that overproduces Gcn4p (GCN4c, 0.2 m LiCl). As predicted, a significant decrease in pAp levels occurred under these conditions. Similarly, treatment of cells with both LiCl and 3-AT, which causes histidine starvation and strong derepression of GCN4 expression, also led to a decrease in pAp levels, in this case to near baseline levels (WT, 0.2 m LiCl +3AT). The Xrn1p-sensitive RNA ITS1 Accumulates in NaCl-treated Cells Deficient in GCN4 Expression—We chose to study the effect of pAp accumulation on an RNA known to be sensitive to Xrn1p in wild type and gcn4Δ strains by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). Xrn1p activity participates in the degradation of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1), a product of rRNA processing (42Stevens A. Hsu C.L. Isham K.R. Larimer F.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7024-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strains defective for Xrn1p exonuclease activity show increased levels of ITS1 RNA due to its stabilization (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4), independently of the presence of NaCl (compare with lanes 7 and 8). Within the first hour of NaCl addition, cells deficient for Gcn4p accumulated higher levels of ITS1 RNAs than wild type cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 5 and 6 and lanes 2 and 6). These results are in perfect correlation with the accumulation of pAp, the inhibitor of Xrn1p, observed in the gcn4Δ mutant strain in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 2). We wondered whether the inhibition of the 5′–3′-mRNA degradation pathway, in gcn4Δ cells in the presence of NaCl, would affect cell growth since xrn1Δ mutant cells have a slow growth phenotype (6Kearsey S. Kipling D. Trends Cell. Biol. 1991; 1: 110-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This slow growth phenotype is independent of GCN4 expression (Fig. 4A, see the similar growth rate of xrn1Δ or xrn1Δgcn4Δ strains). In the presence of salt, however, both the xrn1Δ and the xrn1Δ gcn4Δ strains show similar growth rates to the wild type strain, suggesting that some adaptation has occurred, possibly through increased activity of the alternative 3′–5′ degradation pathway (43Benard L. RNA. 2004; 10: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Inactivation of both the 5′–3′ and the 3′–5′ pathways has been shown to be lethal in yeast (44Johnson A.W. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We thus decided to measure the effect of salt on growth of a gcn4Δ mutant in the absence of cytoplasmic 3′–5′ degradation by also removing Ski2p. Ski2p is a putative RNA helicase necessary for cytoplasmic 3′–5′-mRNA degradation (45Anderson J.S. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). We predicted that in the absence of Ski2p, the accumulation of pAp in the presence of salt in cells also lacking Gcn4p would show a slow growth phenotype due to inhibition of Xrn1p. Indeed, a significant decrease in growth rate was observed in the ski2Δ gcn4Δ strain grown in the presence of salt when compared with the control strains ski2Δ or gcn4Δ, whereas these three strains grew similarly in the absence of salt (Fig. 4). On the other hand, the xrn1Δ gcn4Δ strain (in which only the cytoplasmic 3′–5′-mRNA degradation pathway is active), the wild type strain, and the xrn1Δ and gcn4Δ strains showed similar growth rates in the presence of sodium (Fig. 4B), in agreement with the hypothesis that the 3′–5′ degradation pathway is not inhibited by the accumulation of pAp (43Benard L. RNA. 2004; 10: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Inhibition of HAL2 Expression, and Not an Imbalance in Ion Homeostasis, Is Responsible for pAp Accumulation in NaCl-treated gcn4Δ Cells—In the absence of extracellular methionine, the expression of the HAL2 gene, which contains a specific cis-acting element responding to methionine limitation upstream of its promoter sequence, is expected to be maximal (14Glaser H.U. Thomas D. Gaxiola R. Montrichard F. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3105-3110Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Under this condition, sulfate assimilation is efficiently triggered, Hal2p activity is sufficient to convert all pAp to AMP (11Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), and thus only traces of pAp are detectable (Fig. 2, WT in SD medium). We first asked whether the effect of Gcn4p on pAp accumulation was related to the fact that Gcn4p is an activator of HAL1 expression (46Pascual-Ahuir A. Serrano R. Proft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hal1p plays an important role in maintaining Na+/K+ ion homeostasis and was shown to confer salt tolerance when overexpressed in yeast cells, possibly by activating Ena1p, a sodium/lithium extrusion ATPase (Fig. 1) (47Gaxiola R. de Larrinoa I.F. Villalba J.M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3157-3164Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). It was therefore possible that the accumulation of pAp in gcn4Δ mutants in the presence of NaCl was due to higher internal sodium concentrations in a gcn4Δ genetic background, resulting in greater inhibition of Hal2p enzymatic activity. We thus performed HPLC analysis of nucleotide extracts from control and NaCl-treated wild type and hal1Δ cells. We used 0.6 m NaCl for this experime"
https://openalex.org/W2059144722,"LolA, a periplasmic chaperone, binds to outer membrane-specific lipoproteins released from the inner membrane through the action of an ATP-binding cassette transporter, LolCDE and then transfers them to the outer membrane receptor LolB, thereby mediating the inner to outer membrane transport of lipoproteins. The crystal structure of free LolA revealed that it has an internal hydrophobic cavity, which is surrounded by hydrophobic residues and closed by a lid comprising α-helices. The hydrophobic cavity most likely represents the binding site for the lipid moiety of a lipoprotein. It is speculated that the lid undergoes opening and closing upon the binding and transfer of lipoproteins, respectively. To determine the functions of the hydrophobic cavity and lid in detail, 14 residues involved in the formation of these structures were subjected to random mutagenesis. Among the obtained 21 LolA derivatives that did not support growth, 14 were active as to the binding of lipoproteins but defective in the transfer of lipoproteins to LolB, causing the periplasmic accumulation of a lipoprotein as a complex with a LolA derivative. A LolA derivative, I93G, bound lipoproteins faster than wild-type LolA did, whereas it did not transfer associated lipoproteins to LolB. When I93G and wild type LolA co-existed, lipoproteins were bound only to I93G; which therefore exhibited a dominant negative property. Another derivative, L59R, was also defective in the transfer of lipoproteins to LolB but did not exhibit a dominant negative property. Taken together, these results indicate that both the hydrophobic cavity and the lid are critically important for not only the binding of lipoproteins but also their transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2168864307,"Epidemiological studies suggest that an environmental factor (possibly a virus) acquired early in life may trigger multiple sclerosis (MS). The virus may remain dormant in the central nervous system but then becomes activated in adulthood. All existing models of MS are characterized by inflammation or demyelination that follows days after virus infection or antigen inoculation. While investigating the role of CD4+ T cell responses following Theiler's virus infection in mice deficient in STAT4 or STAT6, we discovered a model in which virus infection was followed by demyelination after a very prolonged incubation period. STAT4-/- mice were resistant to demyelination for 180 days after infection, but developed severe demyelination after this time point. Inflammatory cells and up-regulation of Class I and Class II MHC antigens characterized these lesions. Virus antigen was partially controlled during the early chronic phase of the infection even though viral RNA levels remained high throughout infection. Demyelination correlated with the appearance of virus antigen expression. Bone marrow reconstitution experiments indicated that the mechanism of the late onset demyelination was the result of the STAT4-/- immune system. Thus, virus infection of STAT4-/- mice results in a model that may allow for dissection of the immune events predisposing to late-onset demyelination in MS."
https://openalex.org/W2054443404,"In budding yeast, phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (Plc1p encoded by PLC1 gene) is important for function of kinetochores. Deletion of PLC1 results in benomyl sensitivity, alterations in chromatin structure of centromeres, mitotic delay, and a higher frequency of chromosome loss. Here we intended to utilize benomyl sensitivity as a phenotype that would allow us to identify genes that are important for kinetochore function and are downstream of Plc1p. However, our screen identified SIN4, encoding a component of the Mediator complex of RNA polymerase II. Deletion of SIN4 gene (sin4Δ) does not suppress benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells by improving the function of kinetochores. Instead, benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells is caused by a defect in expression of FLR1, and the suppression of benomyl sensitivity in plc1Δ sin4Δ cells occurs by derepression of FLR1 transcription. FLR1 encodes a plasma membrane transporter that mediates resistance to benomyl. Several other mutations in the Mediator complex also result in significant derepression of FLR1 and greatly increased resistance to benomyl. Thus, benomyl sensitivity is not a phenotype exclusively associated with mitotic spindle defect. These results demonstrate that in addition to promoter-specific transcription factors that are components of the pleiotropic drug resistance network, expression of the membrane transporters can be regulated by Plc1p, a component of a signal transduction pathway, and by Mediator, a general transcription factor. The results thus suggest another layer of complexity in regulation of pleiotropic drug resistance.

In higher eukaryotes, the hydrophilic IP3 triggers the release of calcium from internal stores and thus modulates Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated pathways, whereas the hydrophobic 1,2-diacylglycerol activates the phospholipid- and Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C (1Divecha N.

In yeast cells, PLC (Plc1p encoded by PLC1) and three inositol polyphosphate (InsPs) kinases (Ipk2p/Arg82p, Ipk1p, and Kcs1p) constitute a nuclear signaling pathway that affects transcriptional control (4Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and export of mRNA from the nucleus (5York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives I.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recently, InsPs produced by a Plc1p-dependent pathway have been shown to regulate the activity of chromatin remodeling complexes in vivo and in vitro (6Shen X. Xiao H. Ranallo R. Wu W.-H. Wu C. Science. 2003; 299: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 7Steger D.J. Haswell E.S. Miller A.L. Wente S.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The induction of the phosphate-responsive PHO5 gene, chromatin remodeling of its promoter, and recruitment of Swi/Snf and Ino80 chromatin remodeling complexes are impaired in the ipk2/arg82 mutant strain (7Steger D.J. Haswell E.S. Miller A.L. Wente S.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In vitro, nucleosome mobilization by the yeast Swi/Snf complex is stimulated by IP4 and IP5, whereas IP6 inhibits nucleosome mobilization by yeast Isw2 and Ino80 complexes and Drosophila NURF complex (6Shen X. Xiao H. Ranallo R. Wu W.-H. Wu C. Science. 2003; 299: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A possible mechanism by which InsPs affect chromatin remodeling may involve effects on protein conformation of the chromatin remodeling complexes (7Steger D.J. Haswell E.S. Miller A.L. Wente S.R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2003; 299: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Alternatively, IP4 or IP5 might affect the interaction between chromatin remodeling complexes and chromatin, as has been shown for phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and the Swi/Snf complex (8Zhao K. Wang W. Rando O.J. Xue Y. Swiderek K. Kuo A. Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1998; 95: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the gene coding for phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC (PLC1) is not essential; however, its deletion results in a number of phenotypes (9Flick J. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5861-5876Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We found that Plc1p associates with kinetochores and appears to regulate binding of microtubules to kinetochores (10Lin H. Choi J.H. Hasek J. DeLillo N. Lou W. Vancura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 11De Lillo N. Romero C. Lin H. Vancura A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Kinetochores are specialized protein complexes that assemble at centromeric DNA and bind to spindle microtubules. This attachment is essential for proper chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression. We have found that cells with deletion of the PLC1 gene (plc1Δ) display a higher frequency of chromosome loss, nocodazole sensitivity, and mitotic delay. In addition, chromatin extracts from plc1Δ cells exhibit reduced microtubule binding to minichromosomes. PLC1 displays strong genetic interactions with components of the inner kinetochore, and plc1Δ cells display alterations in core centromeric chromatin structure. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that Plc1p localizes to the centromeric loci independently of microtubules (11De Lillo N. Romero C. Lin H. Vancura A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the view that Plc1p affects kinetochore function, possibly by modulating centromeric chromatin structure. In this study, we planned to utilize benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells as a phenotype that would allow us to identify genes that function downstream of PLC1 in a pathway important for kinetochore activity, spindle function, and chromosome transmission. However, we found that mutations in the Mediator complex suppress benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells by a mechanism that is independent of the kinetochore and spindle. Benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells is caused by a defect in FLR1 expression. FLR1 encodes a multidrug membrane transporter that belongs to a major facilitator superfamily (12Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Bauer B.E. Wolfger H. Kuchler K. Biochim. Biophys.

FLR1 overexpression confers resistance to benomyl and several other drugs (15Broco N. Tenreiro S. Viegas C.A. Sa-Correia I. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tenreiro S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1138-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Mutations in the Mediator complex result in derepression of FLR1 expression and increased resistance to benomyl. The results thus demonstrate that mutations that affect transcriptional regulation may result in an altered expression pattern of multidrug permeases and dramatic changes in cellular drug resistance. Strains and Media—All yeast strains used in this study are isogenic to W303 and are listed in Table 1. Standard genetic techniques were used to manipulate yeast strains (18Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in rich medium (YPD; 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or under selection in synthetic complete medium (SC) containing 2% glucose and, when appropriate, lacking specific nutrients to select for a plasmid or strain with a particular genotype. Meiosis was induced in diploid cells by incubation in 1% potassium acetate.TABLE 1Yeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeSource/Ref.W303-1aMA Ta ade2-1 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 ssd1-d2 can1-100R.

After retesting on the same plates, we isolated 13 plc1Δ strains with second site spontaneous mutations that suppress benomyl sensitivity (plc1ΔBenR). Because plc1Δ/plc1Δ homozygous diploids do not sporulate, we backcrossed the mutants three times to the wild-type strain W303-1a to purify the genetic background and to eliminate mutants in which the benomyl resistance is caused by mutations in multiple genes. To assess the dominance/recessivity, the resulting 10 mutants were mated with the parental plc1Δ strain. Only three of the resulting diploids displayed benomyl resistance; therefore, the corresponding mutations were considered dominant. However, seven diploids were benomyl-sensitive, and thus the mutations were considered recessive. The complementation grouping was accomplished by crossing the individual mutants and determining whether the resulting plc1Δ/plc1Δ diploids were sensitive or resistant to benomyl. When the diploid strain behaved like the original haploid strains (BenR), then the mutation was concluded to be in the same gene, and the original haploid strains belonged to the same complementation group. When the diploid strain, unlike the original haploid strains, was sensitive to benomyl, then the mutation was concluded to be in two different genes, and the corresponding haploids belonged to different complementation groups. The seven plc1ΔBenR mutants belong to three complementation groups, designated pbr1 (four mutants), pbr2 (two mutants), and pbr3 (one mutant). Because some tub2 alleles (TUB2 encodes β-tubulin) result in recessive benomyl resistance, it was possible that one of the complementation groups represents mutations in the TUB2 gene. To test this possibility, we performed linkage analysis. Representatives from the three complementation groups were mated with a strain with a marked TUB2 gene (haploid segregant of strain CUY409; Ref. 19Reijo R.A. Cho D.S. Huffaker T.C. Genetics. 1993; 135: 955-962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this strain, the HIS3 marker was inserted just downstream of the TUB2 gene. When the resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected, the resistance to benomyl segregated randomly with respect to TUB2-HIS3, demonstrating that none of the complementation groups represented mutations in the TUB2 gene. Cloning of the wild-type gene responsible for benomyl resistance of the plc1Δ mutant was accomplished by screening one representative from the pbr1 complementation group (pbr1-1) with a yeast genomic library on a plasmid carrying CEN and LEU2 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA). About 5,000 transformants were allowed to grow on SC-Leu and were subsequently replica-plated onto SC-Leu containing 10 μg/ml benomyl. Plasmids were recovered from the transformants that grew well on SC-Leu but failed to grow on SC-Leu containing 10 μg/ml benomyl and were reintroduced back into the pbr1-1 mutant to confirm the phenotype. The inserts in six plasmids isolated in this way were identified by sequencing. The only gene that was not truncated and was present on all six inserts was SIN4. To determine whether SIN4 is allelic to the pbr1-1 mutation, the pbr1-1 mutant was crossed with strain DY1702 (sin4::TRP1; Ref. 20Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The resulting diploid was benomyl-resistant, and upon transformation with the SIN4 plasmid (sin4 homozygous diploid does not sporulate), sporulation, and dissection, all plc1Δ haploids cured of the SIN4 plasmid were also benomyl-resistant. Thus, no recombination between the pbr1-1 locus and sin4::TRP1 was detected, and we conclude that pbr1-1 is allelic to SIN4.

Total RNA was isolated from cultures grown in YPD medium to A600 nm ∼1.0 by the hot phenol method as described previously (21Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). S1 probes were end-labeled in a 25-μl reaction mixture (5 pmol of oligonucleotide, 125 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 6,000 Ci/mmol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1 × T4 polynucleotide kinase buffer and 20 U T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs)) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 25 μl of water; T4 polynucleotide kinase was inactivated at 65 °C for 20 min, and the labeled oligonucleotides were purified using MicroSpin G-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled oligonucleotides (0.5 pmol) were hybridized with 20-40 μg of total RNA in a 50-μl reaction mixture (0.3 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 12 h at 55 °C and treated with S1 nuclease (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (21Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed on 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and quantification was performed using a PhosphorImager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Minichromosome Stability Assay—Mitotic minichromosome stability was measured as a fraction of cells that retained the plasmid after growth in nonselective medium (22Koshland D. Rutledge L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1987; 48: 801-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type, plc1Δ, sin4Δ, and plc1Δsin4Δ cells were transformed with pRS413 plasmid (CEN, HIS3). For each transformant, five single colonies were inoculated separately into medium nonselective for pRS413 plasmid (YPD medium or YPD medium containing benomyl at 2 μg/ml) and grown for about 24 h at 28 °C. At the end of the growth, the cultures were still in the exponential phase, as determined by counting the cells with a hemocytometer and by measuring A600 nm. For each culture, the frequency of His+ cells was determined at the time of inoculation (Fo) and at the end of nonselective growth (Fend) by plating appropriately diluted cultures on YPD plates and subsequent replica plating onto synthetic complete medium lacking histidine (SC-His). The rate of plasmid loss per generation was determined as described (22Koshland D. Rutledge L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1987; 48: 801-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 23Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), according to the following equation: Fend = Fo (FD)G, where FD is the fraction of cells in each generation that retain the minichromosome, and G is the number of generations. The fraction of cells that lose the minichromosome per generation is 1 - FD. The number of cell doublings was calculated by counting the total cell number at the beginning and at the end of nonselective growth. Minichromosome-Microtubule Binding Assay—Preparation of yeast lysates containing minichromosomes and the minichromosome-microtubule binding assay were done as described previously (24Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Cell. 1991; 66: 483-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast cultures were grown to an A600 nm of ∼0.6 after maintaining the cells in exponential growth for several generations. Nocodazole was added to the cultures to 15 μg/ml for 6 h, and nocodazole was also present during preparation of spheroplasts (24Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Cell. 1991; 66: 483-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cells were sphero-plasted by glusulase and osmotically lysed in EBB buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). Minichromosomes were eluted from nuclei by adding 0.3 m NaCl. After 5 min of incubation, the extracts were 3-fold diluted by adding EBB buffer and subjected to two subsequent centrifugations, each at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The clear supernatant was removed, supplemented with 10 μm Taxol, and used for the microtubule-binding assay. Purified tubulin was polymerized in vitro into microtubules (MTs) of an average length of 2 μm as directed by manufacturer (ICN Biochemicals, Inc), and stabilized by addition of the MTs stabilizing drug Taxol (10 μm final concentration). Different amounts of stabilized MTs were added to 500-μl aliquots of the cleared extracts to initiate the microtubule-binding assay. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 8 min. The supernatant and pellet fractions were separated, and the amount of minichromosomes in each fraction was determined by Southern blot using an Ampr probe. The calibration of the band intensities was performed by loading different amounts of the Ampr DNA fragment on the gels, and the band intensities of the scanned images were quantified using UN-SCAN-IT software (Silk Scientific). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells in 1 ml of media were fixed for 1 h by the addition of formaldehyde to 3.7% concentration. Cells were centrifuged, washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, and kept at 23 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, washing, and sonication for 10 s, cells were stained with 0.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and observed using Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope equipped with SPOT RT CCD camera, UV filter set, and ×100/1.4 n.a. oil immersion objective. Isolation of pbr Mutants—Hypersensitivity to the microtubule-destabilizing drugs benomyl and nocodazole is a phenotype shared by mutants with defects in kinetochore, mitotic spindle, and mitotic checkpoint (26Hoyt M.A. Totis L.

Because deletion of the PLC1 gene, encoding phospholipase C, causes hypersensitivity to nocodazole and benomyl (Ref. 10Lin H. Choi J.H. Hasek J. DeLillo N. Lou W. Vancura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; plc1Δ cells cannot grow in the presence of 5 μg/ml nocodazole or 10 μg/ml benomyl), we used this phenotype to identify genes functioning downstream of PLC1. We speculated that chromosomal suppressors of the benomyl sensitivity of the plc1Δ strain may arise because of the mutations in genes functioning in a pathway that either regulates or affects the function of the mitotic spindle. We isolated seven recessive mutations that include three complementation groups as follows: pbr1 (four mutants), pbr2 (two mutants), and pbr3 (one mutant). In this study, we described the identification of SIN4, a gene that corresponds to the pbr1 complementation group (see “Experimental Procedures”). Subsequent experiments demonstrated that pbr2 is allelic to MED2 (see “Results”; mutations in several components of the Mediator cause increased expression of FLR1 and resistance to benomyl). Because the plc1Δpbr1-1 mutant was phenotypically identical to the plc1Δ sin4Δ strain, we used the latter strain in further experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanism of suppression. SIN4 encodes a component of the Mediator complex of RNA polymerase II. However, mutations in SIN4 exhibit pleiotropic phenotypes reminiscent of mutations of histones, suggesting a role for Sin4p in the regulation of chromatin structure (20Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Jiang Y.W. Dohrman P.R. Stillman D. Genetics. 1995; 140: 47-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Macatee T. Jiang Y.W.

Characterization of plc1Δ sin4Δ Mutant—Deletion of PLC1 results in alterations in the structure of centromeric chromatin (11De Lillo N. Romero C. Lin H. Vancura A. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), higher frequency of minichromosome loss, mitotic delay, and reduced binding of minichromosomes to microtubules (10Lin H. Choi J.H. Hasek J. DeLillo N. Lou W. Vancura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because Sin4p was implicated in regulation of chromatin structure (20Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4503-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 32Macatee T. Jiang Y.W. Stillman D.J. Roth S.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was possible that suppression of benomyl sensitivity in plc1Δ cells by sin4Δ mutation (Fig. 1A) occurs at the level of chromatin structure and activity of the kinetochore. To test this possibility, we performed three assays aimed at assessing the function of the kinetochore in wild-type, plc1Δ, sin4Δ, and plc1Δsin4Δ strains. Because the mitotic stability of minichromosomes depends on the function of kinetochores, we determined the stability of the pRS413 minichromosome in wild-type, plc1Δ, sin4Δ, and plc1Δsin4Δ strains in the absence of benomyl and in the presence of a low concentration of benomyl (Fig. 1B). The stability of the pRS413 minichromosome was measured as a fraction of cells that retained the minichromosome after growth in nonselective medium (22Koshland D. Rutledge L. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Hartwell L.H. Cell. 1987; 48: 801-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As we reported previously, plc1Δ cells displayed about 5-fold higher minichromosome loss rate than wild-type cells (10Lin H. Choi J.H. Hasek J. DeLillo N. Lou W. Vancura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). If sin4Δ suppresses benomyl sensitivity of plc1Δ cells by improving the function of the kinetochore, then we would expect that plc1Δsin4Δ cells would have a lower rate of minichromosome loss than plc1Δ cells. However, sin4Δ mutation did not suppress the minichromosome loss rate in plc1Δ cells (Fig. 1B). Benomyl (2 μg/ml) increased the minichromosome loss rate less than 2-fold in the wild-type strain but almost 5-fold in plc1Δ cells. Most interestingly, the minichromosome loss rate was almost unaffected in plc1Δsin4Δ cells by the presence of benomyl. This result suggests that sin4Δ mutation does not improve performance of kinetochores in plc1Δ cells in the absence of benomyl but, somehow, protects plc1Δ cells from the effects of benomyl. To gain more insight into the role of SIN4 in the regulation of kinetochore activity, we used an assay developed by Kingsbury and Koshland (24Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Cell. 1991; 66: 483-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) to measure the ability of minichromosomes formed in vivo to bind microtubules in vitro. Wild-type, plc1Δ, sin4Δ, and plc1Δsin4Δ strains were transformed with centromeric plasmid (minichromosome) pRS414, which was then assayed in clarified extracts of these cultures for binding to Taxol-stabilized microtubules. To improve the sensitivity of the assay and to exclude the possibility that any difference in microtubule binding activity between the strains is merely the result of different cell cycle profiles, the assay was performed with lysates prepared from nocodazole-arrested cells (Fig. 1C). The G2/M transition is the phase when the kinetochore is required for progression of the cell cycle through mitosis. It is also when the kinetochore is in its most active state (24Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Cell. 1991; 66: 483-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Kingsbury J. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Kinetochores of cells arrested with nocodazole at the G2/M transition exhibit the highest microtubule binding activity (10Lin H. Choi J.H. Hasek J. DeLillo N. Lou W. Vancura A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3597-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our data for the wild-type strain correspond to these previous results. The saturating concentration of microtubules pelleted about 48 and 50% of the plasmid in the wild-type and sin4Δ strains, respectively, but only 27% in the plc1Δ strain. Again, sin4Δ mu"
