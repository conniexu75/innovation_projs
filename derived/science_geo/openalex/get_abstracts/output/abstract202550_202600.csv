Sixteen patients with Parkinsonism (idiopathic, postencephalitic, and arteriosclerotic types) had a significantly lower amount of dopamine in the urine during a 24-hour period than a group of 24 normal control subjects. In a group of 16 patients with various striatal syndromes the excretion of dopamine and epinephrine was significantly higher than normal. Norepinephrine excretion was similar in the three groups. The lowest mean value of urinary dopamine was found in postencephalitic Parkinsonism; the highest occurred in Wilson's disease."

The reaction is abolished by pinealectomy, but is induced by administration of pineal hormones It is suggested that the normal body lightening reaction is mediated by the pineal gland."

https://openalex.org/W2047093542,"Serum from 30 young alligators was examined by free boundary, starch block, and cellulose acetate strip electrophoresis. The patterns obtained showed that the alligator serum proteins differ significantly from those of other chordates in that an α-globulin is the major component. The average ratio of α-globulin to albumin in the serum is 3.4. In this respect it resembles serum of human beings with renal disease in which the α-globulin ratio to albumin ratio reaches 3.0."

In order to establish basic values of normal blood and serum vitamin for various clinical investigations, microbiological assays were carried out for a number of vitamins by the methods which we have developed."

Antibody was precipitated with a heterologous antigen and was then dissociated from the precipitated complex with hapten. The antigen was partially removed by pH adjustment, and antibody was separated from residual antigen and from hapten by partition chromatography on Sephadex G-25. The antibody, obtained in 50 to 55 percent over-all yield, was 96 percent reactive with homologous antigen. It appeared to consist, of 95 percent of a single component, based upon physicochemical measurements."

https://openalex.org/W2071752838,"Roberts and Thorne1 disagree with my proposals2 for improving the classification of yeasts, but themselves suggest no way of overcoming the difficulties (which they acknowledge exist) in using the present system3. Instead, they emphasize the desirability of constructing a phylogenetic classification ; though this is obviously impracticable."

The surviving cells, however, grow at a similar and constant rate in both sexes."

https://openalex.org/W2011263466,Thresholds for the binocular and monocular perception of movement in depth for a circular stimulus object decreased as target luminance was increased to 0.1 ft-lam. Above 0.1 ft-lam little change in threshold was observed. Superiority of binocular over monocular conditions decreased with higher luminances.

Following our earlier report1 on the production of 3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl D-xylose by the action of a cell-free extract of A. niger 152 on a cellobiose–xylose mixture, the corresponding disaccharide containing an α-glucosidic linkage has now been synthesized via the following reaction : catalysed by a transglycosylase from Penicillium lilacinum."
