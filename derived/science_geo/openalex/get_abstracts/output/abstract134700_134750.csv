https://openalex.org/W2021654192,"We have cloned and characterized the mouse cDNA of a third mammalian homolog of the Drosophila period gene and designated it mPer3. The mPER3 protein shows ∼37% amino acid identity with mPER1 and mPER2 proteins. The three mammalian PER proteins share several regions of sequence homology, and each contains a protein dimerization PAS domain. mPer3 RNA levels oscillate in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and eyes. In the SCN, mPer3 RNA levels are not acutely altered by light exposure at different times during subjective night. This contrasts with the acute induction by light of mPer1 and mPer2 RNA levels during early and late subjective night. mPer3 is widely expressed in tissues outside of brain. In liver, skeletal muscle, and testis, mPer RNAs exhibit prominent, synchronous circadian oscillations. The results highlight the differential light responses among the three mammalian Per genes in the SCN and raise the possibility of circadian oscillators in mammals outside of brain and retina."
https://openalex.org/W1986576876,Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major integrator of adaptive responses to stress. Two biochemically and pharmacologically distinct CRF receptor subtypes (CRFR1 and CRFR2) have been described. We have generated mice null for the CRFR1 gene to elucidate the specific developmental and physiological roles of CRF receptor mediated pathways. Behavioral analyses revealed that mice lacking CRFR1 displayed markedly reduced anxiety. Mutant mice also failed to exhibit the characteristic hormonal response to stress due to a disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Homozygous mutant mice derived from crossing heterozygotes displayed low plasma corticosterone concentrations resulting from a marked agenesis of the zona fasciculata region of the adrenal gland. The offspring from homozygote crosses died within 48 hr after birth due to a pronounced lung dysplasia. The adrenal agenesis in mutant animals was attributed to insufficient adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production during the neonatal period and was rescued by ACTH replacement. These results suggest that CRFR1 plays an important role both in the development of a functional HPA axis and in mediating behavioral changes associated with anxiety.

https://openalex.org/W2069638671,"In mammals, neurons are highly differentiated and play distinctive functions even in the same brain region. We found a novel cadherin-related neuronal receptor (Cnr) gene family by studying Fyn-binding activity in mouse brain. CNR1 protein is located in the synaptic junction and forms a complex with Fyn. Sequence analysis of eight Cnr products of approximately 20 genes indicates that these comprise a novel cadherin family of the cadherin superfamily. The expression patterns of each member of this novel family were grossly similar to each other but restricted to subpopulations of neurons of the same type. The diversity of the Cnr family genes suggests that there are molecular mechanisms that govern highly differentiated neural networks in the mammalian CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2078933272,"Both the sec6/8 complex and septin filaments have been implicated in directing vesicles and proteins to sites of active membrane addition in yeast. The rat brain sec6/8 complex coimmunoprecipitates with a filament composed of four mammalian septins, suggesting an interaction between these complexes. One of the septins, CDC10, displays broad subcellular and tissue distributions and is found in postmitotic neurons as well as dividing cells. Electron microscopic studies showed that the purified rat brain septins form filaments of 8.25 nm in diameter; the lengths of the filaments are multiples of 25 nm. Glutaraldehyde-fixed rat brain sec6/8 complex adopts a conformation resembling the letter “T” or “Y”. The sec6/8 and septin complexes likely play an important role in trafficking vesicles and organizing proteins at the plasma membrane of neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2073224154,"Liver toxicity following an overdose of acetaminophen is frequently considered a model for drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Extensive studies over many years have established that such toxicity is well correlated with liver protein arylation by acetaminophen metabolites. Identification of protein targets for covalent modifications is a challenging but necessary step in understanding how covalent binding could lead to liver toxicity. Previous approaches suffered from technical limitations, and thus over the last 10 years heroic efforts were required to determine the identity of only a few target proteins. We present a new mass spectrometry-based strategy for identification of all target proteins that now provides a comprehensive survey of the suite of liver proteins modified. After administration of radiolabeled acetaminophen to mice, the proteins in the liver tissue lysate were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In-gel digestion of the radiolabeled gel spots gave a set of tryptic peptides, which were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Interrogation of data bases based on experimentally determined molecular weights of peptides and product ion tags from postsource decay mass spectra was employed for the determination of the identities of modified liver proteins. Using this method, more than 20 new drug-labeled proteins have been identified. Liver toxicity following an overdose of acetaminophen is frequently considered a model for drug-induced hepatotoxicity.

It is therapeutically safe and has a high therapeutic index. It is commonly used as a substitute for aspirin because of its lower incidence of side effects. However, an overdose of acetaminophen may cause acute, often fatal, centrilobular liver necrosis in both humans and animals (1Hinson J.A. Pohl L.R. Monks T.J. Gillette J.R. Life Sci. 1981; 29: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For more than 2 decades, evidence has mounted implicating the cytochrome P-450 metabolite,N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), 1The abbreviations used are: NAPQI,N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; PSD, postsource decay; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: NAPQI,N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MS, mass spectrometry; PSD, postsource decay; EST, expressed sequence tag; GST, glutathione S-transferase. as the reactive intermediate responsible for the toxicity (2Harvison P.J.

At therapeutic doses, this metabolite is efficiently detoxified by reduced glutathione (GSH) to form an acetaminophen-glutathione conjugate (8Potter W.Z. Thorgeirsson S.S. Jollow D.J. Mitchell J.R. Pharmacology. 1974; 12: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, following toxic doses of acetaminophen, available glutathione pools are depleted, allowing reactive metabolites access to liver proteins, the putative mediators of the hepatotoxicity observed.As early as 1973, Jollow et al. (9Jollow D.J. Mitchell J.R. Potter W.Z. Davis D.C. Gillette J.R. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar) found that the drug-protein adducts accumulate in hepatocytes in the centrilobular region of the liver, wherein hepatocytes undergo extensive necrosis after acetaminophen administration. Moreover, pretreatment of animals with agents that either increase or decrease NAPQI formation yields parallel increases or decreases in binding to proteins in hepatocytes correlated with hepatocellular damage. This general association of the degree of protein covalent modification with severity of toxicity led Jollow and co-workers (9Jollow D.J. Mitchell J.R. Potter W.Z. Davis D.C. Gillette J.R. Brodie B.B. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1973; 187: 195-202PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest that “acetaminophen-induced hepatic necrosis may be caused by the covalent binding of a chemically reactive metabolite to vital hepatic macromolecules.” This hypothesis has found support in more recent studies utilizing immunochemical analyses reported by Roberts et al. (10Roberts D.W. Bucci T.J. Benson R.W. Warbritton A.R. McRae T.A. Pumford N.R. Hinson J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 359-371PubMed Google Scholar, 11Roberts D.W. Pumford N.R. Potter D.W. Benson R.W. Hinson J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1987; 241: 527-533PubMed Google Scholar) and Bartoloneet al. (12Bartolone J.B. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Fundam. Appl.

Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using Western immunoblotting to hepatic proteins separated using one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), these workers demonstrated that a small number of proteins appeared susceptible to drug modification, which suggests considerable selectivity with respect to the particular proteins targeted (14Pumford N.R. Roberts D.W. Benson R.W. Hinson J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Bartolone J.B. Beierschmitt W.P. Birge R.B. Hart S.G. Wyand S. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1989; 99: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Investigations carried out using antibodies prepared from different haptens have revealed somewhat different patterns of gel bands that contain putative acetaminophen-protein adducts. These results indicate most extensive modification occurring in a band of proteins around 56 kDa (14Pumford N.R. Roberts D.W. Benson R.W. Hinson J.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1990; 40: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 15Bartolone J.B. Beierschmitt W.P. Birge R.B. Hart S.G. Wyand S. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicol. Appl.

Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 4763-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Although drug/protein adduct formation has long been thought to play a key role in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, little is known about the processes or mechanisms by which such modification(s) to particular target proteins might lead to liver cell necrosis. Throughout the last decade, several groups have expended considerable efforts in this regard, resulting in the identification of only a handful of the entire suite of hepatic proteins known to be targets of drug metabolite reactivity. These include selenium-binding protein (17Bartolone J.B. Birge R.B. Bulera S.J. Bruno M.K. Nishanian E.V. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1992; 113: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 18Pumford N.R. Martin B.M. Hinson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1348-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), a subunit of glutamine synthetase (19Bulera S.J. Birge R.B. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 134: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), N-10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (20Pumford N.R. Halmes N.C. Martin B.M. Cook R.J. Wagner C. Hinson J.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 280: 501-505PubMed Google Scholar), glutamate dehydrogenase (21Halmes N.C. Hinson J.A. Martin B.M. Pumford N.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), aldehyde dehydrogenase (22Landin J.S. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 141: 299-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lamin-A (23Hong M. Cohen S.D. Khairallah E.A. Toxicologist. 1994; 427Google Scholar), and carbamyl phosphate synthetase I (24Gupta S. Rogers L.K. Smith C.V. Toxicologist. 1995; 153Google Scholar). Because NAPQI is a very reactive metabolite that binds to numerous hepatic proteins in vivo, binding to any particular protein may be advantitious and does not constitute proof that such a component is a critical protein target contributing to acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity.At this juncture, there is a compelling need to gain a comprehensive knowledge of the entire suite of modified proteins together with the structural nature of their covalent adducts so that further experiments aimed at elucidation of the biochemical basis of compromised cell homeostasis may proceed.In this contribution, we wish to report the identities of all major hepatic proteins covalently modified after administration of a toxic dose of acetaminophen in the mouse. Using a combination of techniques including two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, we have identified 23 hepatic proteins. Having a knowledge of the entire suite of targets should yield new insights into the role of covalent drug binding in the pathogenesis of toxic doses of acetaminophen.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAcetaminophen was purchased from Aldrich. [ring-U-14C]Acetaminophen (6.3 mCi/mmol) was obtained from Sigma. The radiochemical purity of [ring-U-14C]acetaminophen was greater than 96%, as determined by HPLC and 1H NMR on a 300-MHz GE instrument. Electrophoresis reagents were obtained either from Sigma or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HPLC grade solvents were obtained from Fisher.AnimalsB6C3F1 mice were obtained from Simonsen (Gilroy, CA). Prior to the administration of acetaminophen, mice were given phenobarbital as a 0.1% solution in their drinking water for 5 days, and food was withheld from all mice for 15 h. Both radiolabeled and nonlabeled acetaminophen were given as aqueous solutions (20 mg/ml) at doses of 350 mg/kg. The mice were killed by cervical dislocation 2 h after dosing. Gallbladders were removed before livers were subjected to the following procedures.Sample PreparationLivers were weighed and homogenized with a Duall glass type homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ) in 8 × liver weight (g) ml of a solubilizing solution of 7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithiothreitol, and pharmalyte, pH 3–10 (0.36 meq/ml, 1:50 by volume). Thiourea (2m) was added to the homogenizing buffer to increase the solubility of more hydrophobic proteins (25Rabilloud T. Adessi C. Giraudel A. Lunardi J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The homogenate was centrifuged at either 10,000 or 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant protein was removed and stored at −80 °C as 1-ml aliquots in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, with bovine serum albumin as a standard.Covalent BindingCovalent binding of acetaminophen to proteins in liver homogenate was determined at 2.32 nmol/mg of proteins as described previously (26Rashed M.S. Myers T.G. Nelson S.D. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1990; 18: 765-770PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, exhaustive washing was performed with cold methanol/diethylether (3:1, v/v) to remove reversibly bound drug until the radioactivity in the supernatant was less than the background level in two consecutive washes. The remaining protein pellet was dissolved in 0.25 m potassium hydroxide solution at 80 °C for 1 h. The clear solution was then subjected to scintillation counting.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and AutoradiographyElectrophoresis of mouse liver proteins was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. Immobiline DryStrips (18 cm, pH 3–10 NL (nonlinear)) were used for isoelectric focusing on the MultiPhor II (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein samples (200 μl) prepared as described above, 200 ml of rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 65 mm dithiothreitol, pharmalyte pH 3–10 (0.36 meq/ml, 1:50 by volume)), and a trace of bromphenol blue) were placed in a rehydration tray (27Sanchez J.C. Rouge V. Pisteur M. Ravier F. Tonella L. Moosmayer M. Wilkins M.R. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) with the Immobiline DryStrips overnight. Proteins were focused at 20 °C according to the following voltage gradient program: 0–300 V, 2 h; 300–1000 V, 1 h; 1000–3500 V, 1 h; 3500 V, 15 h, using an EPS 3500 XL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) electrophoresis power supply. After a standard SDS equilibrating step, proteins were further separated by SDS-PAGE as described by Anderson (Ref. 28Anderson L. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis: Operation of the ISO-DALT System. 2nd Ed. Large Scale Biology Press, Rockville, MD1991Google Scholar). The separating gel was 11% light nongradient gel made with 30.8% DuracrylTM solution (Chelmsford, MA). The stacking gel contained 4% acrylamide/bis. The gels were run at 50 mA/gel for 9–10 h and then stained for 15 h in 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250, 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 45% water. Gels were destained with 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 45% water. Spots containing radioactivity were detected by autoradiography as described in the operations manual (28Anderson L. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis: Operation of the ISO-DALT System. 2nd Ed. Large Scale Biology Press, Rockville, MD1991Google Scholar) with 8 × 10-inch Kodak X-Omat XAR-2 film.In-gel DigestionThe procedure of Rosenfeld et al. (29Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar), with slight modifications, was used to produce in-gel tryptic digest of all spots of interest.HPLC and DesaltingHPLC separation was performed according to Hall et al. (30Hall S.C. Smith D.M. Masiarz F.R. Soo V.W. Tran H.M. Epstein L.B. Burlingame A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1927-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The salt content was removed by the following procedure. Briefly, samples were dried in a SpeedVac and redissolved in 10 μl of 1% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, water. Using a 10-μl syringe, the reconstituted peptide solution was injected onto a LC Packings μ-guard column (300 μm inner diameter × 1 mm; 5-μm particle size; 300-Å, pore size) preequilibrated with 1% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, water at a rate of no more than 5 μl/min. After washing off the salt with 3 × 10 μl of 1% acetonitrile, 1% trifluoroacetic acid, water at a rate of 10 μl/min, the peptides were eluted by injecting 10, 30, 50, and 90% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoroacetic acid, water (10 μl each in 1 min), consecutively. Eluents were collected, dried, and finally reconstituted in 10 μl of 2% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile, water.Mass SpectrometryMolecular Weight Measurements on Unseparated Tryptic DigestsMolecular weights of all peptides were determined by analyzing one-twentieth of the unseparated tryptic digests employing a matrix-assisted laser desorption (MALDI) delayed extraction reflectron time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Voyager Elite mass spectrometer, Framingham, MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser (337 mm), which has a typical mass resolution, M/dM, of 6000 (FWHM). Peptides were crystallized in a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid prepared in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile, 50% water. The monoisotopic (31Burlingame A.L. Carr S.A. Burlingame A.L. Carr S.A. Mass Spectrometry in the Biological Sciences. Humana, Totowa, NJ1996: 546-553Google Scholar) masses from all spectra recorded for a particular peptide are reported in this work. All MALDI spectra were externally calibrated by using a standard mixture of known peptides.Mass Spectrometric Determination of Partial Peptide SequenceAfter inspection of the MALDI mass spectra of the unseparated mixture of peptides from the spot digest, those components displaying the highest pseudomolecular ion abundance were selected for partial amino acid sequence determination. This was carried out by taking advantage of the inherent metastable fragmentation induced by deposition of excess internal energy during the laser desorption process by recording so-called postsource decay (PSD) mass spectra (32Rouse J.C. Yu W. Martin S.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 6: 822-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Peptides with similar mass values were separated by microbore HPLC before carrying out pseudomolecular ion gating and PSD analysis. Most samples were subjected to a desalting step as described above to obtain higher quality mass spectra (improved signal versusnoise ratio can be achieved after such a clean-up step) that facilitate PSD experiments.Data Base SearchingMS-Fit and MS-Tag were used to perform data base searching. Both programs were developed by Clauser et al. in our group (University of California San Francisco Mass Spectrometry Facility) (33Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Proceedings of the 44th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Portland, OR, May 12–16, 1996. 1996; : 365Google Scholar). 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://rafael.ucsf.edu. MS-Fit is a typical peptide mass fingerprinting program, which compares the experimentally determined masses of tryptic peptides with the theoretical masses of all tryptic peptides that can be calculated from sequences of all proteins in the genomic data bases. All of the proteins (data base entries) matching the input data/parameters were listed in a simple ranking system in which data base entries with the least number of unmatched masses are ranked higher. MS-Tag is a sequence data base searching tool used to match fragment ion tag data contained in a user's tandem mass spectrum to a peptide sequence in an existing data base. Ideally, one would prefer to obtain a tandem mass spectrum with enough fragment ions from which a complete peptide sequence can be determined. In practice, samples such as peptides from in-gel digestion of a two-dimensional PAGE gel spot usually only yield a limited number of fragment ions by PSD, which prevents manual interpretation of these tandem mass spectra. However, each fragment ion is characteristic of the sequence of the peptide under analysis and adds a constraint to data base searching. Therefore, all ions present provide very high discriminating power for searching genomic data bases. MS-Tag integrates all of these constraints by considering each fragment ion and parent ion mass independently to match a single peptide sequence in a genomic data base, so the identity of the protein on a gel spot of interest is also determined. A variety of fragment ion types, as well as immonium ions and internal sequence ions, can be used by the MS-Tag algorithm. This not only facilitates the identification of peptides that are identical to sequences in the data base but also enables homology-tolerant searching to allow for a single mutation, cross-species substitution, sequence polymorphism, modified amino acid, or data base error. The NCBInr protein data base was searched first, and if no match was found, the dbEST DNA data base was further searched to determine the identity of the target protein or a protein homologous to the target protein.RESULTSTwo-dimensional Electrophoresis and AutoradiographySample application and rehydration of Immobiline DryStrips were combined in one step to ease the operation and, more importantly, to increase loading capacity without horizontal streaking and protein precipitation at the sample application point (27Sanchez J.C. Rouge V. Pisteur M. Ravier F. Tonella L. Moosmayer M. Wilkins M.R. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 324-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Gels prepared from a single batch were found to be virtually identical, thus readily permitting inter-gel spot correlation. An example of a two-dimensional preparative gel of a whole liver homogenate stained with Coomassie Blue is depicted in Fig. 1 A. This homogenate was derived from the excised whole liver of a phenobarbital-induced B6C3F1 mouse after treatment with a toxic dose of14C-labeled acetaminophen. This gel was then exposed to film for 2 weeks, and the resulting autoradiogram is shown in Fig. 1 B. Twenty- seven major 14C-containing spots were revealed. Spot-to-spot comparison allowed in-gel digestions to be performed on analogous gels without radioactivity but after administration of the same amount of drug.In-gel Digestion and Mass SpectrometryThe strategy used for identification of acetaminophen targeted proteins is outlined in Fig. 2. Protein spots corresponding to the exposures on the radiogram (Fig. 1 B) were excised from several preparative gels, pooled, and then subjected to in-gel digestion procedures as described above. The number of peptides detected from the unseparated digest of a protein in a two-dimensional PAGE spot varied, since the peptide recovery depends on a variety of factors such as protein size, amino acid composition, hydrophobicity, etc. (35Clauser K.R. Hall S.C. Smith D.M. Webb J.W. Andrews L.E. Tran H.M. Epstein L.B. Burlingame A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).Figure 2Strategy for identifying proteins targeted by acetaminophen employing two-dimensional PAGE, MALDI-MS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Data Base SearchingData base interrogation based on the experimentally determined values of peptides (peptide mass map) from in-gel digestion was carried out routinely on all gel spot digests using MS-Fit. This strategy is known not to be a rigorously definitive criterion for establishing protein identity by computer-based matching of data base entries (35Clauser K.R. Hall S.C. Smith D.M. Webb J.W. Andrews L.E. Tran H.M. Epstein L.B. Burlingame A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5072-5076Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).To circumvent these known difficulties, partial peptide sequence information was obtained based on recording PSD mass spectra, and MS-Tag was used for data base interrogation using the sequence and composition information obtained (33Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Proceedings of the 44th ASMS Conference on Mass Spectrometry and Allied Topics, Portland, OR, May 12–16, 1996. 1996; : 365Google Scholar).2 A typical PSD spectrum does not provide complete sequence ions (a, b, c, x, y, and z ions) of a particular peptide, although a, b, and y ions in the lower mass region are abundant. Internal ions with lower masses (<600 Da) and immonium ions are also evident. Data base searching with MS-Tag uses all of this information together with the mass of the peptide to match the theoretical counterparts calculated from all protein sequences in the data base and to determine the identity of the protein. MS-Tag searching based on one PSD spectrum is usually specific enough to identify a unique protein if the protein is in the data base. Therefore, multiple proteins in mixtures may be identified with confidence. To further increase the confidence of an unambiguous identification, often PSD spectra of several additional peptides were obtained for one gel spot. Finally, the identification can be verified by checking how many of the remaining peptide masses measured by MALDI-MS match the theoretical masses of tryptic peptides from the protein matched.Table I summarizes peptide mass data, sequences determined or attributed by mass, and data base searching results for all protein spots studied. Peptide masses not analyzed by PSD were attributed to a unique sequence by matching the mass to a tryptic peptide from the matched protein (masses of peptides from nonspecific cleavages are not considered). Since the peptide mass measurements were externally calibrated, the mass differences between experimental and theoretical values are different for peptides from different proteins. However, they are very similar for peptides from the same protein (spot) and proportional to the masses of peptides.Table ISummary of data obtained for 30 acetaminophen-modified mouse liver proteins from 30 two-dimensional PAGE gel spotsSpot No.MALDI massΔaThe difference between the measured mass and calculated mass (monoisotopic).Peptide sequence determined by PSD and consistent with massbSequence determined by PSD is underlined.

https://openalex.org/W1987871624,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system may result in neuronal apoptosis in vulnerable brain regions, including cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. The mechanisms for neuronal loss are likely to be multifactorial and indirect, since HIV-1 productively infects brain-resident macrophages and microglia but does not cause cytolytic infection of neurons in the central nervous system. HIV-1 infection of macrophages and microglia leads to production and release of diffusible factors that result in neuronal cell death, including the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat. We demonstrate in this report that recombinant Tat1–86 and Tat peptides containing the basic region induce neuronal apoptosis in approximately 50% of vulnerable neurons in both rat and human neuronal cultures, and this apoptotic cell death is mediated by release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, and by activation of glutamate receptors of the non-N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype. Finally, we show that Tat-induced apoptosis of human neuronal cell cultures occurs in the absence of activation of the transcription factor NFκB. These findings further define cellular pathways activated by Tat, that dysregulate production of tumor necrosis factor α, and lead to activation of glutamate receptors and neuronal death during HIV-1 infection of the central nervous system.

It has been proposed that the mechanisms by which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human imunodeficiency virus type 1; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor α; AMPA, (±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. induces widespread neuronal dysfunction and death in the developing and adult central nervous system may involve activation of glutamate receptor subtypes (1Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 2Gelbard H.A. Epstein L.G. Curr. Opin. Pediatr. 1995; 7: 655-662PubMed Google Scholar). However, the sequence of events that lead to glutamate receptor activation in the setting of HIV-1 infection and low-level chronic inflammation in the central nervous system are complex and poorly understood. Many previous studies on the neuropathogenesis of HIV-1 infection have focused on the neurotoxic effects of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp120 (3Lipton S.A. Sucher N.J. Kaiser P.K. Dreyer E.B. Neuron. 1991; 7: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 4Lipton S.A. Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 913-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed that gp120 causes neuronal toxicity in large part via indirect mechanism(s), possibly mediated by intermediary glial cells that in turn produce cellular metabolites that ultimately lead to excitotoxic activation of glutamate receptors. In contrast, the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat is soluble, secreted, and efficiently taken up by many cell types, including astrocytes and neurons (5Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 6Ma M. Nath A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 2495-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated both full-length Tat and basic Tat peptides (i.e. Tat amino acid residues 31 to 61 (7Nath A. Psooy K. Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S.K. Haughey D. Geiger J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) as mediators of neuronal death. In vitro studies have demonstrated that Tat-induced neuronal cell death occurs via apoptosis (8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and involves activation of a non-NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors (9Magnuson D.S.K. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition, in vivoexperiments have revealed that Tat-mediated neurotoxicity can be prevented by pentoxifylline, an agent that blocks the transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (10Philippon V. Vellutini C. Gambarelli D. Harkiss G. Arbuthnott G. Metzger D. Roubin R. Filippi P. Virology. 1994; 205: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that TNFα-induced neurotoxicity can be prevented in part by blockade of AMPA receptors (11Gelbard H.A. Dzenko K. DiLoreto D. del Cerro C. del Cerro M. Epstein L.G. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 15: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and that application of TNFα to neuronal cultures results in apoptosis through a NFκB-independent mechanism (12Talley A. Dewhurst S. Perry S. Gummuluru S. Dollard S.C. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hence, we theorized that Tat might up-regulate synthesis and/or release of TNFα in neural cell cultures, which in turn could lead to activation of AMPA receptors and neuronal death. In support of this hypothesis, we now demonstrate that application of Tat to neural cultures induces neuronal apoptosis that can be blocked in part by antibodies to TNFα, and by a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, but not a NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist. Human fetal brain tissue between gestational ages of 13 to 15 weeks was obtained, with consent, from women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy, under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health, the University of Rochester Human Subjects Review Board. Adherent blood vessels and meninges were removed and the brain tissue was prepared as described previously, in medium containing N1 components as well as 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, PSN antibiotic mixture (penicillin at 50 mg/liter, streptomycin at 50 mg/liter, and neomycin at 100 mg/liter), and amphotericin B (Fungizone; 2.5 mg/liter) (8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at a density of 105/ml on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips precoated with polylysine (70,000–150,000Mr; Sigma), and placed in 24-well culture dishes. Cells were cultured 14 to 28 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air, and the medium was changed every 3 days. Sample cultures were stained for the neuroendocrine-specific protein, PGP 9.5, neuron-specific enolase, microtubule-associated protein-2, synaptophysin, and glial fibrillary astrocyte protein; under these culture conditions neuronal cultures were >70% homogenous for neurons. The remaining cells were predominantly astrocytes and <5% were microglia-macrophages, as determined by RCA-1 lectin and CD68 staining (13Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.-B. Zhang D. Lipton S.A. Tourtellotte W.W. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (14Biedler J.L. Helson L. Spengler B.A. Cancer Res. 1973; 33: 2643-2652PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured in plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2, fed every 2 days with minimal essential complete medium, and differentiated to a neuronal phenotype, as necessary, by addition of 5 μmretinoic acid (Sigma) for 4–5 days, as described previously (12Talley A. Dewhurst S. Perry S. Gummuluru S. Dollard S.C. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Under these conditions the baseline level of apoptosis in neuronal SK-N-MC cells was identical to vehicle-treated cells when measured by TUNEL staining. 7-Day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed and cerebellar brain tissue was harvested according to the guidelines established by the Animal Welfare Act (1987) and NIH policies. Briefly, cerebellum was collected and washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing trypsin at 0.25 mg/ml and 0.1% DNase (about 10-ml volume per cerebellum), then minced into 2-mm3 pieces, and triturated with a fire polished pipette, followed by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C (15Hatten M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 384-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). The tissue was filtered through nylon mesh and the cell suspension was loaded over a two-step Percoll gradient and centrifuged 1 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, to remove glia. The neurons were collected and washed twice in sterile medium without serum, then resuspended in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12 medium with 10% horse serum. Cells were gently triturated and plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/12-mm glass coverslip pre-coated with poly-l-lysine (70,000–150,000 Mr; Sigma) in 24-well culture dishes or at a density of 3 × 106 in poly-l-lysine coated 100-mm culture dishes. After 1–2 days in culture, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine was added to the cultures at 20 mg/ml and uridine at 50 mg/ml, to eliminate proliferative cells (astrocytes), and the purity of the resulting neuronal population was verified by immunocytochemical staining for neuronal markers. Neurons were cultured up to 7 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2; media (serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:F-12) was replaced every 3 days. Immortalized neural cells from rat dorsal raphe were obtained as a generous gift from the Miami Project (Dr. S. R. Whittemore, Miami, FL) and grown at 33 °C as described previously (16White L.A. Eaton M.J. Castro M.C. Klose K.J. Globus M., Y.-T. Shaw G. Whittemore S.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6744-6753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in central nervous system culture media (17Kawamoto J.C. Barret J.N. Brain Res. 1986; 384: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 250 μg/ml G418. In some experiments, cells were differentiated by changing the media to 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 50% Hams F-12 (D/F) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and serum-free media components, and shifting the temperature to 39°C, all as described previously (16White L.A. Eaton M.J. Castro M.C. Klose K.J. Globus M., Y.-T. Shaw G. Whittemore S.R. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6744-6753Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant HIV-1 Tat1–86 was expressed and purified as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein as described previously (8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A thrombin proteolytic digestion procedure was performed to remove the glutathione S-transferase domain from the purified glutathione S-transferase-Tat protein, and Tat preparations were then stored at −70 °C until use. Purified Tat1–86 was further characterized and quantified by protein assay (Lowry method), SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by immunoblot analysis, using a polyclonal antibody (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health), all as described previously (8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To control for the possible presence of contaminating bacterial proteins which might elicit neurotoxicity, an Escherichia coli strain containing a glutathioneS-transferase expression plasmid without the Tat1–86 sequence was used to prepare control extracts, which were purified in the same manner as the Tat fusion protein. This sham extract was used as a vehicle control. For some experiments, recombinant Tat peptides (Tat46–60: SYGRKKRRQRRRPPQ; Tat65–80: HQVSLSKQPTSQPRGD) were obtained from Intracel Corp. (Cambridge, MA). To control for the possibility of lipopolysaccharide contamination of neurotoxic species of Tat, both Tat1–86 and Tat46–60 were heated to 60 °C for 30 min (lipopolysaccharide is heat-stable), then applied to neuronal cultures for 24 h. TUNEL immunostaining of apoptotic neurons in Tat-treated cultures was the same as control vehicle-treated cultures (data not shown). Neurons cultured on 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were treated with Tat or other reagents, and apoptotic cells were then stained using an in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay method (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD), as described (8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons stained by the TUNEL assay were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, then post-fixed with a 100% ethanol:acetic acid solution (2:1), and rinsed again with phosphate-buffered saline. Neurons were pretreated with 2% H2O2 to quench endogenous peroxidase, prior to the addition of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Anti-digoxigenin peroxidase was then added, and catalytically reacted with 0.05% diaminobenzidine in phosphate-buffered saline. TUNEL-stained neurons were then counted from 15 randomly selected fields. Each field of at least 100 neurons was counted for positively stained versus negatively stained cells. A solid phase sandwich ELISA kit (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) was employed to measure human TNFα in culture media from human fetal neuronal cultures and SK-N-MC cultures. Media samples were diluted until within the range of the standard curve. A solid phase sandwich ELISA (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) was employed to measure TNFα in rat cerebellar granule cell cultures. Terminally differentiated SK-N-MC cells (1.5 × 105) were transfected using liposome-mediated gene transfer.

Virol. 1994; 68: 8035-8044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 3.5 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for each transfection. At 40 h after transfection, the recipient cells were either left untreated or incubated with the recombinant Tat protein (500 nm) or rh-TNFα (40 ng/μl; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) for 8 h. Cells were then subjected to extract preparation using a reporter lysis buffer (Luciferase reagent; Promega, Madison, WI) at about 40 μl/105 cells, and luciferase activity was measured with an LKB Wallace 1250 Luminometer. Whole cell extracts were prepared from differentiated SK-N-MC cells (5 × 105) by in situ lysis using ELB buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with various phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of total protein (15–25 μg) were immediately supplemented with 1% SDS, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, fractionated by reducing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred to HybondTM ECLTM nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Life Sciences, Arlington Heights, IL). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) raised against peptides corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of IκBα (C-21) and IκBβ (C-20), were used to form immunocomplexes on these membranes and were further analyzed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). SK-N-MC cells were treated with the indicated species of Tat for varying time periods, followed by collection in phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation 800 × g for 5 min, and then subjected to nuclear extract preparation as described previously (20Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). EMSA was performed by incubating the nuclear extracts (15 μg) with32P-radiolabeled probes at 20–22 °C for 10 min, followed by resolution of DNA-protein complexes on native 4% polyacrylamide gels as described previously (18Maggirwar S.B. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2605-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe used in this EMSA had the following sequence: CAACGGCAGGGGAATTCCCCTCTCCTT. Digitized images of TUNEL-stained neurons in 15 or more microscopic fields were analyzed for numbers of positively stained neuronal nuclei, and for total numbers of neurons, per × 50 field using computerized morphometry (Imaging Research Inc., Ontario, Canada). Data were expressed as % TUNEL-positive neurons, and arithmetic mean values, and standard errors of mean values were calculated; significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Tat has previously been shown to induce TNFα mRNA and protein production in macrophages and astrocytes (21Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and results from this laboratory have shown that TNFα is neurotoxic to terminally differentiated (i.e. neuronal) SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells, but not to undifferentiated SK-N-MC cells (12Talley A. Dewhurst S. Perry S. Gummuluru S. Dollard S.C. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether recombinant Tat1–86 was toxic to terminally differentiated SK-N-MC cells. Fig. 1 A demonstrates that when Tat1–86 or Tat46–60 peptide containing the basic domain is applied to undifferentiated SK-N-MC cells with a glial phenotype (i.e. cells not treated with retinoic acid), no significant cell death is observed. In contrast, when either Tat1–86 or Tat46–60 peptide is applied to differentiated SK-N-MC cells with a neuronal phenotype (i.e.retinoic acid treated cells), 20–25% of neuronal cells are TUNEL-stained, indicative of apoptotic death (Fig. 1 B). However, Tat65–80 peptide, which lacks the basic, neurotoxic region, is not neurotoxic to neuronal SK-N-MC cells, in agreement with previously published studies (7Nath A. Psooy K. Martin C. Knudsen B. Magnuson D.S.K. Haughey D. Geiger J.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1475-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We further investigated the role of TNFα in the neuronal cell death that occurred after exposure to Tat, by co-incubating neuronal SK-N-MC cells with Tat46–60 peptide, plus a neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against human TNFα (clone cA2; Ref. 22Elliott M.J. Maini R.N. Feldmann M. Kalden J.R. Antoni C. Smolen J.S. Leeb B. Breedveld F.C. MacFarlane J.D. Bijl H. Woody J.N. Lancet. 1994; 344: 1105-1108Abstract PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that the neuronal cell death that occurs after exposure to Tat46–60peptide can be markedly reduced with cA2. Similar results were obtained in primary cultures of human fetal neurons when full-length Tat was incubated with cA2 (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that both Tat1–86 and Tat46–60 peptide induce neuronal apoptosis in part through synthesis and/or release of TNFα. Because TNFα may be neuroprotective in some rodent neuronal culture systems (23Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and because Tat has been demonstrated to have anti-apoptotic effects when applied to serum-deprived rodent PC12 neuronal cells (24Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the effects of Tat1–86 on primary cultures of rodent cerebellar granule neurons and immortalized rat dorsal raphe neurons (RN46A). In rodent cerebellar granule neuronal cultures, application of Tat1–86 resulted in apoptosis in 60–70% of primary cerebellar granule neurons, and in approximately 15% of differentiated RN46A neurons (data not shown). Despite differentiation with retinoic acid, SK-N-MC cultures still contain some cells with glial phenotypes, as do primary human fetal cortical neuronal cultures. Additionally, primary human fetal cortical neuronal cultures contain <5% macrophages (13Gelbard H.A. Nottet H.S.L.M. Swindells S. Jett M. Dzenko K.A. Genis P. White R. Wang L. Choi Y.-B. Zhang D. Lipton S.A. Tourtellotte W.W. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4628-4635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potentially, this population of glial cells and/or macrophages could serve as a source of TNFα, particularly since Chen et al. (21Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Tat1–72 markedly elevated production of TNFα by highly purified cultures of macrophages and astrocytes. We therefore set out to examine whether Tat could induce TNFα production by macrophage and glial cells in a variety of primary neuronal culture systems. Using an ELISA detection method to measure soluble TNFα in culture media, we determined that basal levels of TNFα in a primary human fetal cortical neuronal culture 24 h after the application of vehicle control were below detectable levels of the assay, while treatment with 500 nm Tat1–86 elevated TNFα levels to 176.6 ± 2.3 pg/ml (Fig. 3). In contrast to the full-length protein, the shorter Tat peptide (Tat46–60) containing the basic region elicited a lesser response (TNFα levels to 32.5 ± 0.3 pg/ml), while the non-neurotoxic Tat65–80 had no effect on TNFα production 24 h after addition to neuronal cultures (data not shown). As expected, co-incubation of human neuronal cultures with Tat1–86 or Tat46–60 plus the TNFα neutralizing monoclonal antibody cA2 completely reversed this effect (Fig. 3). Additional experiments were performed to test whether Tat1–86 could elevate TNFα levels in the media of postnatal rodent cerebellar granule neuronal cultures. Here Tat1–86 elevated TNFα only 2-fold, and cA2 was not used to reverse this effect because it does not bind or neutralize rodent TNFα (Ref. 22Elliott M.J. Maini R.N. Feldmann M. Kalden J.R.

We have previously shown that TNFα induces neuronal apoptosis through a mechanism that involves oxidative stress, and is blocked by overexpression of either bcl-2 or the caspase inhibitor, crmA, but is independent of NFκB activation (12Talley A. Dewhurst S. Perry S. Gummuluru S. Dollard S.C. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). NFκB, present in the cytoplasm of most cell types, is normally bound to a member of a family of inhibitor proteins known as IκB. The best characterized member of this family IκB-α, binds specifically to the P65/P50 heterodimer of NFκB in the cytoplasm. When cells are exposed to inducers of NFκB, such as TNFα, the mitogen-activated protein kinase-NIK signaling pathway (25Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 26Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar), followed by serine phosphorylation (Ser32 and Ser36) of IκB-α and subsequent degradation of this protein by the 26 S proteasome complex (32Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 33Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). NFκB is thus released to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. Because Tat1–86 and Tat46–60 peptide induce neuronal apoptosis in part through production of TNFα and activate NFκB in other cell types (21Chen P. Mayne M. Power C. Nath A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22385-22388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we wondered whether NFκB activation might play a significant role in mediating Tat-induced neuronal death. To investigate whether Tat1–86 could transduce a signal for activation of NFκB in neuronal SK-N-MC cells, studies were performed to test the effect of Tat1–86 on the fate of IκB. In untreated SK-N-MC cells, a single 37-kDa form of IκB-α was detected with an IκB-α-specific antiserum (Fig. 4 A). Incubation of the cells with Tat1–86 (500 nm, at the LD50for neuronal apoptosis; see Ref. 8New D.R. Ma M. Epstein L.G. Nath A. Gelbard H.A. J. Neurovirol. 1997; 3: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) for 2–6 h did not induce any detectable change in steady state levels of IκB-α (Fig. 4 A; compare the intensity of the IκB-α band to that of the upper, nonspecific band, which provides a control for total protein content in these extracts). IκB-α levels remained unaltered even when de novo synthesis of IκB-α was inhibited through the addition of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. In order to confirm that neuronal SK-N-MC cells are responsive to other activators of NFκB, we incubated the cells with human recombinant TNFα (40 ng/ml) for various time periods. As expected, this led to the rapid degradation of IκB-α, which was prevented by preincubation of the cells for 15 min with 50 μm of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4 A). Parallel studies showed that TNFα potently activated NFκB driven luciferase activity in transiently transfected neuronal SK-N-MC cells (12Talley A. Dewhurst S. Perry S. Gummuluru S. Dollard S.C. Fine S.M. New D. Epstein L.G. Gendelman H.E. Gelbard H.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mitogen-activated protein kinase-NIK-IκB kinase signal transduction pathway is fully functional in neuronally differentiated SK-N-MC cells. Additional experiments were performed to confirm that Tat1–86 did not activate NFκB in neuronally differentiated SK-N-MC cells. First, immunoblot experiments were conducted using an IκB-β-specific antiserum; no change in IκB-β levels was detected in Tat1–86-treated cells (data not shown). Second, EMSA studies were performed. Constitutive nuclear expression of NFκB was detected in unstimulated, undifferentiated SK-N-MC cells (data not shown). NFκB levels remained unaltered after exposure of cells to retinoic acid, and were similarly unchanged upon exposure to Tat1–86 (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, Tat1–86 treatment in the presence of an anti-TNFα neutralizing antibody (cA2) had no influence on activation of NFκB, indicating that the low levels of TNFα generated due to Tat1–86 treatment of neuronally differentiated SK-N-MC cells are not sufficient to trigger the activation of NFκB. These biochemical analyses of NFκB activation were also verified by direct functional analysis of the transactivation ability of NFκB, with a κB-driven luciferase reporter (p(κB)3conaLUC, Refs. 12Talley A.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying its formation after axotomy are unknown. In this study, we show by real time imaging of the free intracellular Ca2+ concentration, of proteolytic activity, and of growth cone formation that the activation of localized and transient Ca2+-dependent proteolysis is a necessary step in the cascade of events that leads to growth cone formation. Inhibition of this proteolytic activity by calpeptin, a calpain inhibitor, abolishes growth cone formation. We suggest that calpain plays a central role in the reorganization of the axon's cytoskeleton during its transition from a stable differentiated structure into a dynamically extending growth cone."

Recent studies indicate that GKLF binds to a core DNA sequence of 5′-(G/A)(G/A)GG(C/T)G(C/T)-3′, which is found in an endogenouscis element, the basic transcription element (BTE) of the cytochrome P-450IA1 (CYP1A1) promoter. The present study characterizes the ability of GKLF to regulate CYP1A1expression. By electrophoretic mobility gel shift assay (EMSA) and methylation interference assay, GKLF was found to bind BTE in a manner similar to several other transcription factors known to interact with BTE including Sp1 and BTEB. Cotransfection studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that GKLF inhibited the CYP1A1 promoter in a dose- and BTE-dependent manner. The same experiments also revealed that BTE was responsible for a significant portion of theCYP1A1 promoter activity. EMSA of nuclear extracts from Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that Sp1 and Sp3 were two major proteins that interacted with BTE. Additional cotransfection studies showed that GKLF inhibited Sp1-mediated activation of theCYP1A1 promoter. In contrast, GKLF enhanced Sp3-dependent suppression of the same promoter. Moreover, the ability of GKLF to inhibit Sp1-dependent transactivation was in part due to physical interaction of the two proteins. These findings indicate that GKLF is a negative regulator of the CYP1A1 promoter in a BTE-dependent fashion and that this inhibitory effect is in part mediated by physical interaction with Sp1.

Regulation of gene expression is dependent on the functions of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors. Proteins with the zinc finger motif constitute a significant portion of the transcription factor family, primarily because of the stable nature of interaction between a zinc finger and its cognate DNA-binding sequence (1Klug A.

Among the zinc finger proteins the Cys2-His2 (C2H2) type, initially identified in the Xenopus laevis transcription factor TFIIIA (6Pelham H.R. Brown D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4170-4174Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), represents the most common zinc finger motif for DNA binding (7Hoovers J.M. Mannens M. John R. Bliek J. van Heyningen V.

The amino acid sequence in the zinc finger region of GKLF is closely related to several Krüppel-like proteins including LKLF (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), EKLF (11Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell.

However, we recently showed that the amino acid sequence required for the nuclear localization of this group of proteins is more conserved in GKLF, LKLF, and EKLF than in BTEB2 (18Shields J.M.

In vitro, expression of GKLF is induced in conditions that promote growth arrest such as serum deprivation and contact inhibition (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In addition, constitutive expression of GKLF inhibits DNA synthesis (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that GKLF may have an important function in regulating growth and proliferation of specific epithelial and endothelial tissues.The best studied “first-degree” relative of GKLF is EKLF, which is crucial for expression of the β-globin gene (11Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, 19Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies utilizing the gene targeting technique also showed that EKLF is essential for erythropoiesis (21Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 22Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). EKLF acts by binding to and activating the CACCC element in the promoter of the β-globin gene (19Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the close homology in the zinc finger sequence between GKLF and EKLF, GKLF was also found to interact with the β-globin CACCC motif (14Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 15Yet S.-F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.-W. Yoshizumi M.

However, whether GKLF regulates endogenous β-globin gene expression is unclear from these studies. By using an empirical approach called the target detection assay, we recently obtained a consensus, minimal essential binding sequence of 5′-(G/A)(G/A)GG(C/T)G(C/T)-3′ for GKLF (23Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This sequence is similar but not identical to the CACCC element required for globin gene expression.Another cis sequence that is similar to the empirically derived GKLF-binding sequence is the basic transcription element (BTE). This element is present in the promoter of a conserved family of genes encoding the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes includingCYP1A1 (24Yanagida A. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). GKLF has been shown to interact with high affinity with BTE (14Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These findings raised the interesting question whether GKLF is involved in the regulation of theCYP1A1 promoter through BTE. Previous studies have shown that BTE is essential for the basal CYP1A1 promoter activity (24Yanagida A. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.I. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1470-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and that it is the focus of interaction for a multitude of transcription factors including Sp1, BTEB, and BTEB2 (17Sogawa K.

Our current study therefore represents a continuing attempt to decipher further the function of GKLF in regulating expression of endogenous genes, using CYP1A1 as a potential “target” gene.DISCUSSIONGKLF was initially identified by low-stringency library screening with the zinc finger region of zif268/Egr-1 (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that GKLF is one of three members of a subfamily of closely related Krüppel proteins (18Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The other two members are LKLF (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and EKLF (11Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Despite a significant degree of conservation in the zinc finger region (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and in the nuclear localization signal (18Shields J.M. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18504-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) among these three proteins, their tissue distributions and presumed physiological functions are quite different. EKLF is expressed primarily in erythroid tissues including bone marrow and spleen (11Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Gene targeting experiments indicated that EKLF-deficient mice were defective in erythropoiesis during fetal development (21Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 22Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). LKLF, found primarily in lung and spleen (16Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), is necessary to maintain the quiescent state of single-positive T lymphocytes. T cells from mice deficient in LKLF exhibited a spontaneously activated phenotype and died in the peripheral lymphoid organs from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis (41Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). In addition, LKLF is required for the maintenance of vascular integrity during fetal development (42Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The physiological function of GKLF is less well defined although its epithelial (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

In addition, the growth arrest-associated nature of GKLF expression points to a potential function in the regulation of cell proliferation.Among the three aforementioned Krüppel-like proteins, only EKLF has a clearly established target gene. EKLF is a crucial transcription factor for β-globin gene expression and exerts its effect through a CACCC element present in the β-globin promoter (19Hartzog G.A. Myers R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 44-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bieker J.J. Southwood C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 852-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although both GKLF (14Garrett-Sinha L.A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) have also been found to interact with the CACCC element, no definitive endogenous genes have been identified as the targets for either protein to date. It is within the context of identifying target genes that we conducted a study to empirically determine the binding sequence for GKLF (23Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). That study not only established a minimal essential binding site of GKLF, it also identified CACCC and BTE as two naturally occurring ciselements that conform with the binding sequence of GKLF. Our current effort is therefore focused on establishing the relationship between GKLF- and BTE-mediated gene transcription.BTE was selected for the present study because it is the focal point onto which multiple transcription factors converge to exert their effects. Along with the present study, BTE has been found to interact with no fewer than five Krüppel-like factors including Sp1 (26Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Lobayashi A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and GKLF (14, this study). An additional significance of BTE in transcriptional regulation is demonstrated by its presence in the promoter of a plethora of genes that belong to the cytochrome P-450 superfamily (43Nelson D.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25402-25410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In many of these genes BTE was proven to be a crucial determinant of their promoter activity. Moreover, at least one BTE-binding protein, Sp1, has been shown to physically interact with transcription factors binding to other regions of theCYP1A1 promoter and to exert a cooperative influence on the drug-inducible expression of this gene (51Kobayashi A. Sogawa K. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that BTE is likely a crucial cis element involved in the coordinated expression of a large number of related genes. Of additional interest is that many cytochrome P-450 genes includingCYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2B1, andCYP2B2 (27Traber P.G. Chianale J. Florence R. Kim K. Wojcik E. Gumucio J.J. J. Biol.

Florence R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1171: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) are expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract in a similar distribution to that ofGKLF (13Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 14Garrett-Sinha L.A. Eberspaecher H. Seldin M.F. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31384-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These observations raise the distinct possibility that GKLF is a major contributor to the intestinal epithelial expression of these physiologically important cytochrome P-450 genes.By base-specific mutational analysis and methylation interference assay (Figs. 1 and 2, respectively), recombinant GKLF appears to interact with BTE in a very similar, if not identical, manner to Sp1 and BTEB (38Sogawa K. Kikuchi Y. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The dissociation constants of the three proteins in binding to DNA also appear to be reasonably similar to one another (Fig. 10; Ref. 38Sogawa K. Kikuchi Y. Imataka H. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1993; 114: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GKLF, Sp1, and BTEB exhibit similar affinities with respect to BTE binding. It is of interest to note that GKLF binds poorly to a consensus Sp1-binding site (23Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Conversely, Sp1 and Sp3 bind poorly to the empirically determined GKLF-binding site (Fig. 7). To this end, BTE seems to represent a “composite” site to which all these proteins exhibit a high affinity. These features increase the attractiveness of BTE as a “model” element in studying the increasingly complex mechanism by which it mediates gene expression.The results of our cotransfection experiments firmly established that GKLF suppresses CYP1A1 promoter activity in a BTE-dependent fashion. Moreover, this inhibitory effect appears to be exerted at the expense of Sp1, which has an activating effect on the same promoter. This behavior of GKLF is reminiscent of that observed for BTEB (26Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K.-I. Kikuchi Y. Sasano K. Lobayashi A. Hayami M. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In that study, BTEB exhibited a similar suppressive effect on the CYP1A1 promoter in a BTE-dependent manner. In addition, BTEB inhibited Sp1-mediated activation of the same promoter. However, this suppressive effect was dependent on the context of the DNA, BTEB was an activator when multiple copies of BTE were present in the promoter. Our laboratory has made a similar observation. When two tandem copies of either a consensus GKLF-binding site (23Shields J.M. Yang V.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or BTE 2W. Zhang and V. W. Yang, unpublished observations. were used to drive a reporter, GKLF increased the reporter activity. The mechanism for this pleiotropic effect is unclear at this time although there are examples of other bifunctional transcription factors including Sp3 (31Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G.

Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) that exhibit a similar DNA-dependent positive and negative effect. GKLF was also found to contain distinct domains that mediate repression and transactivation similar to Sp3 and YY1 (15Yet S.-F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.-W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M.

It is therefore possible that conformational changes resulting from protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions may be the basis for the pleiotropic effect of GKLF.Although a number of possible mechanisms may exist that are responsible for the suppression of the CYP1A1 promoter by GKLF, the most likely explanation is that the suppression is based on a competitive mechanism. This is demonstrated by the inhibition of binding of Sp1 to BTE in the presence of recombinant GKLF (Fig. 11). This passively accomplished repression may be augmented by GKLF once it is bound to the promoter via an intrinsic repressive domain within GKLF (15Yet S.-F. McA'Nulty M.M. Folta S.C. Yen H.-W. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Layne M.D. Chin M.T. Wang H. Perrella M.A. Jain M.K. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The cooperative nature of suppression exerted by GKLF and Sp3 on theCYP1A1 promoter (Fig. 9) further supports the latter hypothesis. A similar finding on the competitive binding to BTE by different proteins has previously been observed between Sp1 and BTEB (38Sogawa K. Kikuchi Y. Imataka H. Fuj"

How do olfactory sensory neurons find their glomerular targets? To address this question, we have visualized the genesis of the peripheral olfactory system in living zebrafish embryos. Dye labelings reveal that a primordial yet stereotyped map of glomeruli is apparent during embryogenesis. By labeling a small number of cells with an ectopically expressed green fluorescent protein reporter, we can observe the dynamic growth behaviors of individual olfactory neuron growth cones as they project to their glomeruli. We find that olfactory axons extend directly to their partner glomeruli, suggesting that these cells' growth cones rely upon pathfinding cues to reach their targets."
https://openalex.org/W2044375623,"AP-1 transactivation appears to be required for mouse JB6 cell neoplastic transformation induced by the tumor promoter TPA or epidermal growth factor (EGF). Exposure to AP-1 transrepressing retinoids and glucocorticoids and expression of a dominant negative c-jun (TAM67) blocked tumor promoter-induced AP-1 transactivation and neoplastic transformation. The aim of the present study was to extend the inquiry of the role of AP-1 and other transcription factors to human neoplastic progression. Expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 or 18 E6 and E7 immortalizes human keratinocytes and inhibits serum/calcium-stimulated differentiation. Further transformation by v-fos co-expression renders these keratinocytes tumorigenic in nude mice. We have analysed two series of E6/E7 immortalized human keratinocyte cell lines that show progressing phenotypes ranging from differentiation sensitive to anchorage-independent to tumorigenic in nude mice. We analysed the activities of AP-1 and NF-κB which may `cross-talk'. Both DNA binding and transactivation of AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors showed elevation in the anchorage-independent (16RH) and tumorigenic (18 v-fos) keratinocyte lines compared to the less progressed but immortalized cell lines. HPV E7 was expressed at a constant level shown by quantitative RT-PCR in both the more and the less progressed lines, indicating that E7 is not the factor limiting this progression. Blocked shift/supershift analysis indicates that Fos family member proteins especially Fra-1 and Fra-2 are related to progression and no changes found in the Jun family member proteins although they are present in the AP-1/DNA binding complex. When a dominant negative mutant c-jun driven by a human keratin 14 promoter was co-transfected with AP-1 or NF-κB reporters, both AP-1 and NF-κB activities were suppressed in the more progressed cell lines 16RH and 18 v-fos but not in the less progressed 16RL or 18 cell lines. Overexpression of the same dominant negative c-jun did not inhibit p53 dependent reporter transactivation, indicating the specificity of inhibition of AP-1 and NF-κB transactivation in the HPV-immortalized cells. Stable transfectants of this mutant c-jun in the two more progressed cell lines 16RH and 18 v-fos showed reduced AP-1 and NF-κB activation and reduced anchorage-independent growth. Together, these results indicate that activation of AP-1, NF-κB or both may contribute to neoplastic progression in HPV immortalized human keratinocytes and that specific targeting of the elevated levels seen in benign or malignant tumors might be effective for prevention or treatment of human cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2013581389,"The role of the cytosolic N terminus of the main subunit (α1C) of cardiac L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel was studied inXenopus oocyte expression system. Deletion of the initial 46 or 139 amino acids (a.a.) of rabbit heart α1C caused a 5–10-fold increase in the whole cell Ca2+ channel current carried by Ba2+ (IBa), as reported previously (Wei, X., Neely, A., Olcese, R., Lang, W., Stefani, E., and Birnbaumer, L. (1996) Recept. Channels 4, 205–215). The plasma membrane content of α1C protein, measured immunochemically, was not altered by the 46-a.a. deletion. Patch clamp recordings in the presence of a dihydropyridine agonist showed that this deletion causes a ∼10-fold increase in single channel open probability without changing channel density. Thus, the initial segment of the N terminus affects channel gating rather than expression. The increase in IBa caused by coexpression of the auxiliary β2A subunit was substantially stronger in channels with full-length α1C than in 46- or 139-a.a. truncated mutants, suggesting an interaction between β2A and N terminus. However, only the I–II domain linker of α1C, but not to N or C termini, bound β2A in vitro. The well documented increase of IBa caused by activation of protein kinase C (PKC) was fully eliminated by the 46-a.a. deletion. Thus, the N terminus of α1C plays a crucial role in channel gating and PKC modulation. We propose that PKC and β subunit enhance the activity of the channel in part by relieving an inhibitory control exerted by the N terminus.

Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 39: H620-H627Google Scholar). The biphasic response to PKC stimulators is fully reconstituted when expression of L-type channels in Xenopus oocytes is directed by RNA extracted from rat heart (39Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E.

Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or cRNA of rabbit cardiac α1Csubunit (39Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Increase of Ca2+ channel activity by phorbol esters has also been observed in a mammalian cell line (baby hamster kidney) expressing the rabbit cardiac α1C (36Hirano Y. Yoshinaga T. Niidome T. Katayama K. Hiraoka M. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 93-104PubMed Google Scholar). The potentiation by phorbol esters of Ca2+ channels expressed in the oocytes is mediated by PKC because it is mimicked by diacylglycerols and blocked by specific PKC inhibitors (39Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 40Bourinet E. Fournier F. Lory P. Charnet P. Nargeot J. Pfluegers Arch. 1992; 421: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Both α1C and β are substrates for PKC-catalyzed phosphorylation (Ref. 41Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and references therein). α1Csubunit has been recognized as the target for the Ca2+channel enhancement caused by PKC, since coexpression of the auxiliary subunits was not necessary to reproduce the effect of phorbol esters; on the contrary, coexpression of the β subunit weakened the enhancement suggesting a modulatory effect for this subunit (39Singer-Lahat D. Gershon E. Lotan I. Hullin R. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which part of α1C is involved in the PKC action. α1C isoforms cloned from rat brain (42Snutch T.P. Tomlison W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and human heart (43Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) are not up-regulated by PKC (43Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 44Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 929-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), suggesting that the site of PKC action lies in one of the variable regions. More specifically, Bouron et al. (43Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) proposed that phosphorylation of the initial segment of the N terminus of the rabbit heart isoform may account for PKC potentiation, but this hypothesis has not been tested. It was unclear how this part of α1C can affect the function of the channel, because in a recent publication Weiet al. (1Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar) reported that deletion of up to 120 initial N-terminal amino acids strongly increased the whole cell Ca2+ channel current and, proportionally, the total gating charge movement but did not affect the voltage dependence of the charge movement or of the macroscopic current activation. It has been proposed (1Wei X. Neely A. Olcese R. Lang W. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Recept. Channels. 1996; 4: 205-215PubMed Google Scholar) that the N-terminal deletion causes an increase in the amount of functional channels (hence the increase in total gating charge movement) but does not affect channel function. In the beginning of this study we set out to test which part of α1C accounts for the PKC-induced enhancement of the rabbit heart L-type channel, using deletion and single-site mutagenesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes. We found that, as predicted by Bouron et al. (43Bouron A. Soldatov N.M. Reuter H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), deletion of the first 46 a.a. (which are thought to be unique to the rabbit heart isoform) eliminates the PKC-induced enhancement. To understand whether and how the N terminus affects the function of the channel, we have undertaken a more elaborate study of the properties of N-terminal deletion mutants and GST fusion proteins. Immunochemical and single channel measurements demonstrated that N-terminal deletions do not increase channel expression but rather enhance activation on single channel level. We find evidence for an interplay between N terminus, PKC, and the β subunit, although we could not detect any direct binding between N terminus and β. Our results point to the possibility that potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channels by PKC, and part of the enhancement caused by the β subunit, may result from attenuation of a tonic inhibitory control exerted by the N terminus. Furthermore, since the enhancing effect of PKC on L-type Ca2+ channels is widespread among mammalian species, our data suggest that α1C isoforms with N termini of the “rabbit heart” type must also be widespread. cDNAs of rabbit heart α1C (pCAH), rabbit heart β2A, and skeletal muscle α2/δ subunits were prepared and used as described previously (45Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 46Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The cDNAs of the following mutants of α1C were made within the original pCAH construct: ΔN88–139; st1665; S533I; S1575A (16Perets T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Lotan I. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A PCR-based approach was designed for engineering all the other constructs used in this work. In an attempt to improve the expression of channels composed of α1C alone, we subcloned the coding sequence of α1C into a high expression vector, pGEM-SB, derived from pGEM-HE which contains a 50-base 5′-untranslated region and a 300-base 3′-untranslated region from Xenopusα-globin (47Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). pGEM-SB was produced by a standard PCR procedure used to extend the polylinker which now includes the following restriction sites: SmaI, BamHI, SalI,ClaI, BstEII, EcoRI, XbaI, and HindIII. By using standard PCR procedures, aSalI site was created immediately preceding the initial ATG of α1C, and a HindIII site was created following the termination codon. After a series of intermediate subcloning and ligation steps, the coding sequence of α1Cwas inserted between SalI and HindIII sites of pGEM-SB. The resulting cDNA was termed α1C-SB; for synthesis of sense RNA with T7 polymerase, it was linearized withNheI. This procedure did not significantly improve the currents directed by the expression of α1C RNA alone, as compared with pCAH, but provided a convenient tool for the creation of N-terminal deletion mutants. The cDNA of the neuronal α1C isoform, rbC-II, was kindly provided by T. P. Snutch (University of British Columbia; see Ref. 42Snutch T.P. Tomlison W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar); this DNA was injected directly into the nuclei. To create α1C N-terminal truncations, PCR amplification with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) was performed using 100 ng of WT α1C cDNA as template for 25 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C. For each deletion mutant unique forward and reverse primers were used, with a forward primer creating a SalI site followed by an initiation codon and then by the original WT α1C sequence starting from the desired base. For ΔN2–46, the forward primer was 5′-AT GTC GAC TAA ACC ATG G330GT TCC AAC TAT GG-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-GCT AAG GCC ACA CAA TTG GC-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 687–706 and includes an endogenous unique MfeI site. The restriction sites SalI and MfeI are underlined, respectively. To create ΔN2–139, the forward primer was 5′-TAG CCGGTC GAC ATG A609AG AAC CCC ATC CGG A-3′. Reverse primer sequence was 5′-AG CTC AAT TTT CTC CTC CTT GGC CTC-3′, complementary to nucleotides 2673–2698 and is close but downstream from the endogenous unique EcoRI site (the superscript number in the oligonucleotide sequence indicates the corresponding position in the rabbit cardiac α1C sequence) (48Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). The amplified fragments were used to replace the corresponding fragment in α1C-SB DNA. The net result was the deletion from the second amino acid residue through the number indicated in the name of construct. DNAs of α1C fragments designed to create glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed using a similar PCR strategy, with primers containing the desired restriction sites. These fragments were cloned into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-terminal cDNA fragment (N, encoding a.a. 1–154) and three C-terminal cDNA fragments (C, encoding a.a. 1505–2171, C1, encoding a.a. 1664–1845, and C2, encoding a.a. 1821–2171) were inserted into EcoRI andNotI restriction sites of pGEX-4T-1. GST-LI-II, encoding a.a. 438–550, was inserted into EcoRI andXhoI sites of pGEX-4T-1. The C1 fragment was additionally subcloned into pGEM-HE vector at the same restriction sites, and two more N-terminal fragments, N1–139 and N88–139, were created by a similar PCR procedure and also inserted into pGEM-HE between EcoRI and HindIII for in vitro transcription and expression in oocytes. All PCR products were sequenced at the Tel Aviv University Sequencing Facility. Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro using the suitable RNA polymerases, as described (49Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). When WT and one of the mutant channels have been compared in electrophysiological experiments, care was taken always to use RNAs derived from the same cDNA vector. Materials and enzymes for molecular biology were purchased from Boehringer-Mannheim, Promega, or MBI Fermentas. Xenopus laevis frogs were maintained and operated, and oocytes were collected, defolliculated, and injected with RNA as described (49Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar, 50Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M.M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In each experiment, oocytes were injected with equal amounts (by weight) of the mRNAs of the various channel subunits in the desired combinations and with RNAs of additional proteins as detailed in the figure legends. Oocytes were incubated at 20–22 °C in ND96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. For patch clamp experiments, the vitelline membrane was removed with fine forceps after ∼5 min incubation in the bathing solution, as described (49Dascal N. Lotan I. Longstaff A. Revest P. Methods in Molecular Neurobiology. 13. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 205-225Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded using two-electrode voltage clamp as described (45Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), in a solution containing 40 mm Ba(OH)2, 50 mmNaOH, 2 mm KOH, and 5 mm HEPES, titrated to pH 7.5 with methanesulfonic acid. Usually, the concentrations of α1C RNA of WT and N-terminal deletion mutants were not equal but chosen in such a way that the amplitudes of the expressed currents were below 3 μA, to avoid artifacts introduced by series resistance and by Ba2+-activated Cl− currents when larger currents are measured (51Singer-Lahat D. Lotan I. Biel M. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). Net Ba2+ currents were obtained by a standard leak subtraction procedure or, when α1C subunit alone was expressed, by subtraction of currents measured after inhibiting all Ca2+ channel currents by 100 μm Cd2+. Absence of contribution of the endogenous currents of the oocyte was verified by inhibiting IBa with 10 μm nifedipine. Single channel recordings were done in the cell-attached mode as described (50Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M.M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), using Axopatch 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Pipettes contained 110 mm BaCl2, 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5. The oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 130 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5. Currents were filtered at 2 kHz (4-pole Bessel) and sampled at 10 or 5 kHz. Voltage steps from −80 to 10 mV lasting 140 or 280 ms were delivered every 1 or 2 s. Leak and capacitative currents were subtracted from the traces using blank sweeps during the analysis session. Data acquisition and analysis were done with pCLAMP (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). This was performed as described (50Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M.M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 52Ivanina T. Perez T. Thornhill W.B. Levin G. Dascal N. Lotan I. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with mRNAs and incubated in NDE solution containing 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3–4 days at 22 °C. Plasma membranes together with the vitelline membranes (extracellular collagen-like matrix) were removed manually with fine forceps after a 5–15-min incubation in a low osmolarity solution. The remainder of the cell (internal fraction) was processed separately. 10–30 plasma membranes and 10 internal fractions were solubilized in 100 μl of buffer (4% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline) and heated to 100 °C for 2 min. Following the addition of 100 μl of H2O and 800 μl of the immunoprecipitation buffer (190 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 2.5% Triton X-100), homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated for 16 h with the Card-I polyclonal antibody (53Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A-Sepharose, and pelleted. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with immunowash buffer (150 mm NaCl, 6 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02% SDS). Samples were boiled in SDS-gel loading buffer and electrophoresed on 3–8% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel together with standard molecular mass markers (45–205 kDa). Gels were dried and placed in PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) cassette for up to 3 days. The protein bands of the image were estimated quantitatively using the software ImageQuant, as described (50Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M.M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 54Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12056-12064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). [35S]Met/Cys-labeled β2A was translated on the template of in vitro synthesized RNA using a translation rabbit reticulocyte kit (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. The fusion proteins were synthesized and extracted fromEscherichia coli according to pGEX-4T-1 manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The protein concentration was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Munchen, Germany). Purified GST fusion proteins (5–10 μg) or purified GST (∼10 μg) were incubated with 5 μl of the lysate containing the35S-labeled β2A in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20, for 2 h at room temperature, with gentle rocking. Then the GST fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 30-μl beads were added) for 30 min at 4 °C and washed four times in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20. (In some experiments, the 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with GST fusion proteins already immobilized on the glutathione-Sepharose beads.) Following washing, GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 30 μl) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The results are always presented as means ± S.E. Multiple group comparisons have been done by one-way analysis of variance test followed by Dunnett's test. Two-group comparisons were done using Student's ttest. To study the role of the first 46 amino acids of the N terminus, we created a deletion mutant of α1C in which these amino acids, except the initial methionine, have been deleted (α1CΔN2–46; see Fig. 6 for a scheme of the channel to help localize the deletions). Ba2+ currents via the expressed Ca2+ channels were measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique. The subunit composition of the channels used in this study was varied according to the specific questions asked. The expression of wild-type (WT) α1C subunit alone was rarely employed because it resulted in very small currents, us"

There are, however, a number of significant technical challenges involved in using fMRI with monkeys. Here, we describe the procedures by which we have overcome these challenges to carry out successful fMRI experiments in an alert monkey, and we present the first evidence of activity-related fMRI signals from monkey cerebral cortex."

As with most transmembrane two-domain phosphatases, the role of the second phosphatase domain is unclear. In this study, recombinant CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins purified from bacteria were used to evaluate the function of the individual phosphatase domains. A recombinant protein expressing the membrane-proximal region, first phosphatase domain, and spacer region of CD45 (rD1) was catalytically active and found to exist primarily as a dimer. In contrast to this, a recombinant protein expressing the spacer region, the second phosphatase domain and the carboxy tail of CD45 (rD2) existed as a monomer and had no catalytic activity against any of the substrates tested. Comparison of rD1 with the recombinant protein expressing the entire cytoplasmic domain of CD45 (rD1/D2) indicated that rD1/D2 was 2–3-fold more catalytically active, was more thermostable, and existed primarily as a monomer. Limited trypsin digestion of rD1/D2 provided evidence for a noncovalent association between an N-terminal 27-kDa fragment and a C-terminal 53-kDa fragment, suggesting an intramolecular interaction. Furthermore, rD1 was found to specifically associate with rD2 in an in vitro binding assay. Taken together, these data provide evidence for an intramolecular interaction occurring in the cytoplasmic domain of CD45.

Its phosphatase activity is required for efficient signal transduction initiated by lymphocyte antigen receptors, which is essential for T cell development and T and B cell activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Trowbridge I.S.

The role of CD45 in the dephosphorylation of p56lck and p59fyn is likely to be a necessary prerequisite step for their effective participation in T cell receptor-mediated signaling events. In vitro, CD45 can dephosphorylate several artificial and phosphopeptide substrates, yet only a limited number of substrates have been identified for CD45in vivo. How substrate specificity is achieved in the cell is not yet understood. However, it is of interest to note that CD45 can associate with p56lck, a major substrate for CD45 in T cells, both in vitro (8Autero M. Saharinen J. Pessa-Morikawa T. Soula-Rothhut M. Oetken C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is also not known how the phosphatase activity of CD45 is regulated. By analogy with receptors possessing tyrosine kinase activity, it is possible that receptor tyrosine phosphatases may be regulated by dimerization. It has been suggested by cross-linking studies in T cells that CD45 may exist in dimeric form together with CD45AP, a 30-kDa CD45-associated protein (12Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induced dimerization of an epidermal growth factor receptor-CD45 chimera with epidermal growth factor has been shown to inhibit the restoration of T cell signaling events (13Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility that CD45 activity may be regulated by dimerization. In addition, the first phosphatase domain (PTP-D1) of a related phosphatase, RPTPα, crystallized as a dimer, with the membrane-proximal region of one PTP domain inserted into the catalytic region of the second PTP domain. It was predicted that if such an interaction occurred under more physiological conditions, phosphatase activity would be inhibited (14Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). However, to date, no direct evidence has been obtained for the formation of CD45 dimers. CD45, like RPTPα, belongs to the growing family of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. For most members of the transmembrane, two-domain phosphatase family, the majority of catalytic activity has been shown to reside in PTP-D1 and the function of the second phosphatase domain (PTP-D2) is unclear. PTP-D2 of RPTPα has been shown to possess catalytic activity, albeit at much lower levels than PTP-D1 (15Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In other transmembrane PTPs, no phosphatase activity has been detected for PTP-D2, which in some instances lack key residues involved in catalysis (Refs. 16Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Tsai A.Y.M.

In these cases, a regulatory role for PTP-D2 has been suggested, and in some two-domain PTPs, the presence of PTP-D2 has been shown to be required for optimal PTP-D1 activity (15Wang Y. Pallen C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3231-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13516-13522Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For CD45, contradictory data exists as to whether CD45 is an active phosphatase in the absence of PTP-D2 (17Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2399-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol.

Recent data shows that CD45 PTP-D1 is active when coupled to a maltose-binding protein fusion partner but is not active when the fusion partner is proteolytically removed (24Lorenzo H.K. Farber D. Germain V. Acuto O. Alzari P.M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Likewise, conflicting data exists as to whether CD45 PTP-D2 is an active phosphatase. No catalytic activity has been attributed to CD45 PTP-D2 when expressedin vitro as a recombinant protein (18Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or after the essential cysteine in PTP-D1 has been mutated to a serine and expressedin vitro (16Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Tsai A.Y.M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8698-8702Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Thai T. Tang M. Saito H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the critical cysteine in PTP-D1, but not in PTP-D2, prevented the restoration of CD45-mediated T cell signaling events (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4002-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), indicating that phosphatase activity residing in PTP-D1, and not PTP-D2, was essential for this function. However, expression in eukaryotic cells of an active, truncated form of CD45 lacking the catalytic cysteine present in PTP-D1 has led researchers to suggest that PTP-D2 has phosphatase activity (26Tan X. Stover D.R. Walsh K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6835-6838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the function of PTP-D2 of CD45 is unclear. To clarify the function of the individual PTP domains of CD45 and to determine the role of these domains in the enzymatic function of CD45, recombinant CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins were produced inEscherichia coli, purified, and analyzed. It was found that rD1 of CD45 was an active protein-tyrosine phosphatase in the absence of PTP-D2 and was present as a dimer. In contrast, no phosphatase activity was detected for rD2 of CD45. In the two-domain CD45 cytoplasmic domain protein, the presence of PTP-D2 enhanced the stability of the enzyme and was required for optimal enzymatic activity. Specific binding of rD1 to rD2 and the association of N- and C-terminal tryptic fragments of rD1/D2 provided evidence for an intramolecular interaction occurring in rD1/D2. In the absence of the C-terminal region including PTP-D2, intermolecular interactions occur, leading to the formation of rD1 dimers. Nickel-NTA-agarose was from Qiagen Inc.

Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A truncation mutant (rD1) encoding residues 564 to 927, containing the membrane-proximal region, PTP-D1, and the spacer region, was constructed previously (18Johnson P. Ostergaard H.L. Wasden C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8035-8041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into the pET-3D-6HisIEGR vector (28Ng D.H.W. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Another truncation mutant (rD2) encoding residues 901–1268, which contains part of the spacer region, PTP-D2, and the carboxy tail, was made by removing a DraIII fragment and adding a linker (5′-AGATCTCCA-3′) to introduce a BglII site. A second construct encoding the membrane-proximal region, PTP-D2, and carboxy tail (rD2.2) was made by deleting aHincII-NdeI fragment containing residues 649 to 943 and adding a HincII-NdeI linker (5′-TATGGAACAACATT-3′), restoring residues 940 to 943. BglII fragments containing rD2 and rD2.2 in pBluescript SK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were subcloned into pET-3d-6HisIEGR (28Ng D.H.W. Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) or XL1-Blue E. coli(Stratagene). rD2.2 was expressed in conjunction with a pT-Trx vector (30Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Maiti A. Johnson P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cultures were induced at 26 °C, and all other steps were at 4 °C. Cells were lysed in 100 μg/ml lysozyme, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmimidazole, pH 7.2, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA. Proteins bound to Nickel-NTA-agarose were washed with lysis buffer plus 0.5 m NaCl and 1.0 m NaCl and eluted in 1m imidazole, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The eluent was passed through a PD-10 column equilibrated in 90% buffer A (20 mmTris, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol), 10% buffer B (1 m NaCl in buffer A) and eluted from a MonoQ column using a linear gradient of 10 to 40% buffer B. rD2.2 was purified as above except instead of separation on a MonoQ column, it was loaded onto a Superose 12 column equilibrated in 20 mmTris, pH 7.2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol, 160 mm NaCl. All buffers used for protein purification contained 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1.0 μg/ml each of pepstatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin. After purification, recombinant proteins were concentrated using the Centricon 10 concentrator from Amicon (Beverly, MA.), glycerol was added to 50%, and proteins were stored at −80 °C. GST and GST-rD2 were purified as per manufacturer's instructions and left bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham), glycerol was added to 50%, and GST and GST-rD2 were stored at −80 °C. Assays using the phosphopeptides as substrates were performed as described (31Ng D.H.W. Harder K.W. Clark-Lewis I. Jirik F. Johnson P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 179: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant proteins were diluted in 10 μl of phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), and assayed at equal molar concentrations (23 nm final concentration) with 10 μl of phosphopeptide (15 μm to 2 mm final concentration). For assays using pNPP, 5 μl of recombinant protein diluted in phosphatase buffer (final concentration 7.5 nm) was added to 195 μl of 19 μm to 2.5 mm pNPP at 30 °C to start the reaction. The increase in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored continuously using a SOFTmax PRO kinetic analysis program in a SpectraMax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). A molar extinction coefficient of 1.8 × 104m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the concentration of p-nitrophenolate. pH optimum curves were obtained by measuring phosphatase activity of equal molar concentrations of rD1 and rD1/D2 (ranging from 22 to 50 nmfinal concentrations), 13.5 mm pNPP as substrate in the following buffers plus 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm sodium citrate for pH 4.3 to 6.0, 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate for pH 6.8 and 10.1, and 50 mm Tris for pH 7.2 to 8.8. Thermostability experiments were performed where 233 nm rD1/D2 and rD1 were incubated at temperatures ranging from 30 to 65 °C for 5 min before phosphatase activity was measured at 30 °C by adding 5 μl of enzyme to 195 μl of 2.5 mm pNPP. This was performed at 30 °C as described (32Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 5 μl of rD1 or rD1/D2 (60 nm) was added to 5 μl of autophosphorylated GST-p56lck (55 nm) to initiate the reaction. The reaction was stopped by immersion in a dry ice/ethanol bath, samples were electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore Corp., Bedford MA.), and the amount of phosphorylated substrate remaining was determined by Western blot analysis with 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine antibody diluted 1/10,000 as the primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1/5000 (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL) as the secondary antibody. The blot was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham) and exposed to BioMax film from Eastman Kodak Co. Trypsin was added to 1.5 μg of rD1/D2 in a total volume of 20 μl of substrate buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2) at ratios of 1:100, 1:50, 1:25, and 1:10 w/w. The digest was incubated at 37 °C for 1 to 4 h and terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 5 μl of each sample was run on a native polyacrylamide gel, and 15 μl was run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. 12 μg of rD1/D2 was digested with trypsin for 1.5 h at 1:25 w/w rD1/D2:trypsin, reducing sample buffer was added at 37 °C for 15 min, and the sample was electrophoresed on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.025% Coomassie R-250, the 53-kDa and 27-kDa bands were excised, and the N-terminal sequence was obtained from the Nucleic Acid-Protein Service (NAPS) unit (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, B.C., Canada). A Superose 12 gel filtration column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol. The column was calibrated with globular protein gel filtration standards from Bio-Rad (gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa)) and bovine albumin fraction V (67 kDa) from Life Technologies, Inc. rD1, rD2, rD2.2, and rD1/D2 were each applied separately to the column in concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μg/ml for rD1, rD2 at 5 to 20 μg/ml, rD2.2 at 100 μg/ml, and rD1/D2 at 5 μg/ml to 1 mg/ml. 20% homogeneous native polyacrylamide gels were run on the Pharmacia PhastSystem according to manufacturer's instructions. Bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) and ovalbumin (44 kDa) were used for size reference. 1 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was washed with binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 0.025% β-mercaptoethanol), and 1 μg of soluble 6-His-tagged protein was added to the immobilized protein. Binding buffer was added to a final volume of 50 μl, and the mixture was incubated on ice, shaking for 2 h. The mixture was then washed 5 times with 1 ml of binding buffer and separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with anti-His antibody diluted 1/1000 as the primary and horseradish-peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1/2500 as the secondary. Blots were developed as described above. The membrane was then stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the immobilized proteins and subjected to densitometry scan analysis. Recombinant 6-His-tagged CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins: rD1, containing the membrane-proximal region, PTP-D1, and the spacer region, (residues 564–927); rD2, containing part of the spacer region, PTP-D2, and the carboxy tail (residues 901–1268); a second PTP-D2 construct, rD2.2, containing the membrane-proximal region, PTP-D2, and the carboxy tail (residues 649–939 deleted); the full-length cytoplasmic domain proteins (residues 564–1268), rD1/D2, and a catalytically inactive mutant, C817S, are represented schematically in Fig. 1 A. These proteins were purified from E. coli (Fig. 1 B). rD1 typically purified as a doublet with both bands detected by anti-CD45 cytoplasmic domain antisera (data not shown), suggesting that the lower band is a proteolytic fragment. Equal molar amounts were assayed for phosphatase activity, and rD1 was found to be catalytically active using the CD3ζ pY83 phosphopeptide as a substrate, although it was about 2-fold less active than rD1/D2 (Fig. 2). Both rD2 and C817S had no detectable activity against this substrate. Kinetic analysis of rD1 and rD1/D2 activity using pNPP and other tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides as substrates indicated that the two-domain phosphatase (rD1/D2) was a 2–3-fold more efficient enzyme than rD1 (Table I). In contrast to this, the rD2 proteins expressing either the membrane-proximal region or the spacer region at the N terminus of the protein did not exhibit any detectable phosphatase activity for any of the substrates listed in Table I. Even when 100× more enzyme (2.6 μm) was assayed for up to 4 h with CD3ζ pY83 or pNPP substrates, no detectable activity was observed. The presence of PTP-D2 in the rD1/D2 protein did not affect the substrate specificity of CD45, at least when tested against the substrates indicated in Table I. rD1 and rD1/D2 were also able to dephosphorylate autophosphorylated recombinant GST-p56lck (Fig. 3). Comparison of the initial rates of dephosphorylation (Fig. 3 B) indicated that the recombinant two domain phosphatase, rD1/D2, was again approximately 2-fold more efficient than rD1.Figure 2Phosphatase activity of CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteins. Equal molar concentrations of rD1/D2, rD1, and C817S (23 nm) and 12.5-fold more of rD2 (288 nm) were assayed against a saturating concentration of CD3ζ pY83 phosphopeptide (2 mm) using malachite green to detect release of inorganic phosphate (see “Experimental Procedures”). Readings were taken at 0, 1, and 3 min for rD1/D2 and rD1 and 0, 3, and 20 min for rD2 and C817S (only up to 3-min time point is shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IPhosphatase activity of recombinant CD45 cytoplasmic domain proteinsSubstrateEnzymeKmkcatkcat/Kmmms−1m−1s−1pNPParD1/D2 and rD1 were each assayed at 7.5 nmusing pNPP as a substrate.rD1/D20.15 ± 0.011.33 ± 0.158.89 × 103rD10.15 ± 0.010.56 ± 0.083.70 × 103CD3ζ pY83 (LGRREEpYDVLEKKRA)rD1/D20.31 ± 0.0793 ± 223.00 × 105rD10.38 ± 0.0733 ± 60.87 × 105fyn pY531 (TATEPQpYQPGENL)rD1/D20.35 ± 0.03110 ± 163.14 × 105rD10.35 ± 0.0447 ± 111.34 × 105src pY416 (LIEDNEpYTARQGA)rD1/D20.36 ± 0.0998 ± 212.72 × 105rD10.44 ± 0.0650 ± 131.14 × 105cdc2 pY15 (KIGEGTpYGVVYKA)rD1/D20.25 ± 0.0683 ± 163.32 × 105rD10.25 ± 0.0524 ± 70.96 × 105PDGF-R pY1021 (NEGDNDpYIIPLPD)rD1/D20.31 ± 0.0487 ± 202.81 × 105rD10.23 ± 0.0628 ± 131.21 × 105rD1/D2 and rD1 were each assayed at 23 nm.

To further investigate the differences between the single (rD1) and two-domain CD45 phosphatase (rD1/D2), enzymatic activity was compared at different pHs (Fig. 4). Both rD1 and rD1/D2 showed optimal activity at pH 7.2 using pNPP as the substrate and displayed a similar pattern of activity in the basic pH range. However, in the acidic pH range, between pH 5.5–7.0, rD1/D2 consistently showed a higher level of activity than rD1 alone, indicating that the presence of PTP-D2 creates a more favorable environment for an ionizable group involved in the catalytic reaction. Thermostability of enzyme activity was also assessed by incubating rD1/D2 and rD1 at the indicated temperatures in Fig. 5 for 5 min"

To define functional domains in the highly conserved N-terminal region of TFIIB, we have analyzed 14 site-directed substitution mutants of yeast TFIIB for their ability to support cell viability, transcription in vitro, accurate start site selection in vitro and in vivo, and to form stable complexes with purified RNAPII in vitro. Mutations impairing the formation of stable TFIIB·RNAPII complexes mapped to the zinc ribbon fold, whereas mutations conferring downstream shifts in transcription start site selection were identified at multiple positions within a highly conserved homology block adjacent and C-terminal to the zinc ribbon. These results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of yeast TFIIB contains two separable and adjacent functional domains involved in stable RNAPII binding and transcription start site selection, suggesting that downstream shifts in transcription start site selection do not result from impairment of stable TFIIB·RNAPII binding. We discuss models for yeast start site selection in which TFIIB may affect the ability of preinitiation complexes to interact with downstream DNA or to affect start site recognition by a scanning polymerase.

These accessory proteins, termed the general transcription factors (GTFs), have been the focus of much investigation and include TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. The GTFs and RNAPII assemble in an ordered stepwise fashion on a class II promoterin vitro to form a functional preinitiation complex (PIC) (reviewed in Ref. 1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Assembly is initiated by the binding of TFIID to the TATA element via the TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit, in some cases assisted by TFIIA. This complex is recognized by TFIIB, which binds and recruits RNAPII and TFIIF. PIC formation is completed by the association of TFIIE and then TFIIH, and the resulting complex can hydrolyze ATP and initiate mRNA synthesis. In contrast to this ordered-assembly model for PIC formation, it has been proposed that a preassembled holoenzyme, consisting of RNAPII, most of the GTFs, and additional factors, is recruited in one step to promoter-bound TFIIDin vivo (reviewed in Ref. 1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The general transcription factor TFIIB has an essential role in RNAPII transcription, and together with RNAPII and TBP, defines the minimal set of factors necessary for promoter-dependent transcription of a supercoiled DNA template in vitro (1Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In both the ordered-assembly and holoenzyme-recruitment models of PIC formation, TFIIB recognizes promoter-bound TFIID and facilitates association of the remaining GTFs and RNAPII. Consistent with this role, TFIIB interacts with DNA adjacent to the TATA box (2Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H.

In addition, TFIIB is involved in the selection of transcription start sites, as mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUA7gene, encoding TFIIB, can alter transcription start site selectionin vivo and in vitro (7Bangur C.S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conservation of TFIIB structure among eukaryotic organisms underscores its central role in transcription. The protein is comprised of a highly conserved N-terminal region and a C-terminal core domain (Fig. 1). Although no structural information has been obtained for full-length TFIIB, NMR structures have been obtained for the core domain of human TFIIB and for a portion of the N-terminal region of the archaeal TFIIB from Pyrococcus furiosus (19Bagby S. Kim S. Maldonado E. Tong K.I. Reinberg D. Ikura M. Cell. 1995; 82: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20Zhu W. Zeng Q. Colangelo C.M. Lewis M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure has been reported for the core domain, as well as for a DNA·TBP·core TFIIB ternary complex (21Nikolov D.B. Chen H. Halay E.D. Usheva A.A. Hisatake K. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Burley S.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed several structural motifs, including a zinc ribbon fold in the N-terminal region, a pair of α-helical direct repeats in the core domain, and an amphipathic helix between the repeats. The high degree of amino acid conservation of the N-terminal region of TFIIB suggests that important functions reside in this portion of the protein. Reflecting this, random PCR mutagenesis of the yeast TFIIB gene identified a number of cold- and temperature-sensitive mutants that mapped to this region (22Knaus R. Pollock R. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine the functions of the N-terminal region and to define functional domains, we have undertaken a site-directed mutagenesis study of yeast TFIIB. In previous work, we identified two substitution mutants, L50D and R64E, that exhibited impaired RNAPII binding and a downstream shift in transcription start site selection, respectively (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To extend our analysis and to define the functional domains involved in stable RNAPII binding and transcription start site selection, we have in this work analyzed 14 additional site-directed substitution mutants for their ability to support cell viability, transcription in vitro, accurate start site selection in vitro and in vivo, and to bind purified RNAPII in vitro. Our data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of TFIIB contains two adjacent and separable functional domains involved in stable RNAPII binding and transcription start site selection. Yeast TFIIB substitution mutants were generated using the megaprimer method of PCR mutagenesis and plasmid p314/yIIBN as template as described previously (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For mutants that exhibited altered properties in vivo, N-terminally polyhistidine-tagged derivatives expressed from the normalSUA7 promoter were generated by replacing the 1100-base pairNdeI-PstI fragment of plasmid p314/H6wt (containing the SUA7 coding region) with the corresponding fragment from the p314/yIIBN mutant plasmid as described (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the production of recombinant polyhistidine-tagged TFIIB proteins, the 1100-base pair NdeI-PstI fragment from the relevant p314/yIIBN mutant plasmid was isolated and inserted between the NdeI and PstI sites of bacterial expression plasmid pQE/yIIB (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the ability of the TFIIB mutants to support yeast cell growth, a plasmid-shuffle complementation assay was used (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). Test strain FP153 (MATα, ura3–52, trp1Δ63,sua7Δ1 and p316/yIIB[URA3]) contains a deletion of the chromosomal sua7 coding region (BclI-BamHI) with viability maintained by the presence of a wild-type SUA7 gene on a URA3-based vector. Strain FP153 was transformed with either wild-type or mutant TFIIB constructs in plasmid p314 (TRP1 selectable marker), selecting for Ura+, Trp+ colonies on CAA medium lacking uracil and tryptophan at 30 °C (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in liquid CAA medium lacking uracil and tryptophan at 30 °C, dilutions were spotted on SC medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 4 days. 5-FOA, toxic to cells containing a functional URA3 gene, selects for cells that have spontaneously lost the URA3-containing plasmid p316/yIIB with wild-type TFIIB. Thus, the appearance of 5-FOA-resistant colonies reflects the ability of a TFIIB mutant to support cell viability in the absence of wild-type TFIIB. To further analyze the growth properties of mutants that supported viability, 5-FOA-resistant colonies were grown to mid-exponential phase in liquid YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone, 2% dextrose) medium at room temperature, and dilutions in sterile water were spotted on YPD plates. The plates were incubated at low (16 °C), intermediate (30 °C), or high (37 °C) temperature (Table I). The mutant strains were also analyzed on a variety of other growth media, but the relative growth properties on these media were similar to those observed with YPD (data not shown).Table IGrowth properties of yeast TFIIB N-terminal substitution mutantsYPD16 °C30 °C37 °CWT++++++++++++C45S/C48S−−−L52P−−−W63R+++++++++++W63P−/++++++R64A++++++++++F66D++++++++++H71E++++++−Plus and minus designations correspond to relative growth rates compared to the wild-type (WT).

To determine the steady-state protein levels of TFIIB mutants with altered growth properties, strains containing both wild-type and polyhistidine-tagged mutant SUA7 alleles were grown to mid-exponential phase in liquid CAA lacking tryptophan and uracil. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (24Ponticelli A.S. Pardee T.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 983-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Extracts (50 μg of protein) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the polyhistidine-tag (RGS-His; Qiagen, 1:2,000 dilution) followed by goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories, 1:40,000 dilution). Immune complexes were visualized by the addition of SuperSignal Ultra chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and autoradiography. Polyhistidine-tagged TFIIB proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli host strain JM109 under control of the phage T5 promoter in plasmid pQE32*. Culture growth, recombinant protein expression, and purification were carried out as described previously (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified TFIIB proteins were judged to be >90% pure by SDS-PAGE. TFIIB-depleted whole-cell extracts were prepared from strain FP133 as described (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Strain FP133 (MATα, ura3–52, trp1, leu2, sua7–101, his3::TRP1, prb1–1122, pep4–3, prc1–407, gal2) contains a temperature-sensitive allele of sua7 that results from instability of the mutant TFIIB protein. At room temperature (permissive), strain FP133 contains about 10% of the wild-type levels of TFIIB protein, and the mutant TFIIB protein undergoes accelerated turnover upon shifting to 37 °C. Transcription reactions contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 10% glycerol, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 units of Inhibit-ACE (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), 30 mm creatine phosphate, 1.5 units/ml creatine kinase, 333 μm3′-o-methyl-GTP, 400 μm ATP, 400 μm CTP, 1.5 μm UTP, and 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Supercoiled DNA template, extract, and recombinant proteins were added as described in the figure legends. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, stopped by the addition of 200 μl of stop buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA and 10 units of RNase T1) and incubated for an additional 20 min. Proteinase K (50 μg) and SDS (final concentration of 0.5%) were added, and the resulting mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. RNA transcripts were ethanol-precipitated and subjected to electrophoresis on 7% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried, and transcripts were visualized by autoradiography. Transcription start sites for the ADH1 and CYC1 genes were determined by primer extension analysis of total yeast RNA as described (25Ponticelli A.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2832-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primer for analysis of ADH1 mRNA contained the sequence 5′-dGTATTCCAACTTACCGTGGGATTCG-3′, corresponding to positions +63 to +39 (where +1 is the initiating ATG). The oligonucleotide primer for analysis of CYC1 mRNA contained the sequence 5′-dGTCTTGAAAAGTGTAGCACC-3′, corresponding to positions +53 to +34 (where +1 is the initiating ATG). Purified yeast RNAPII (500 ng) and TFIIB (100 ng) were incubated in 250 μl of P100 buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 100 mm potassium acetate, 14 mm magnesium acetate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors (0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml bestatin, 2.5 μg/ml antipain, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine)) at 4 °C overnight. Pansorbin (Calbiochem) was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 100 mm potassium acetate, 25 mg/ml PVP-K-30 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 60 mg/ml casein, final solution brought to pH 7.9 with 1m KOH). After incubation for 20 min at room temperature, the Pansorbin was harvested by centrifugation and resuspended to its original volume with P100 buffer, and 25 μl was added to each reaction. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking and were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min. Supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes containing 2.5 μg of anti-RNAPII monoclonal antibody (8WG16, Research Diagnostics) and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Pansorbin (pre-blocked, 25 μl in P100) was then added, and the reactions were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min, and the pellets were washed three times with 250 μl of buffer P100 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and once with 250 μl of P100. The pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer, and 10 μl of each sample was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed as described above, using an affinity-purified anti-yeast TFIIB antibody (1:5,000), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Laboratories, 1:40,000). The N-terminal region of TFIIB contains several highly conserved sequence motifs (Fig. 1). To address the role of these motifs in the function of yeast TFIIB, we constructed and analyzed 14 site-directed substitution mutants. Substitutions were introduced at conserved residues that reside within the second rubredoxin knuckle of the zinc ribbon, the C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon, and an adjacent homology block that is highly conserved among seven eukaryotic species. The mutants were initially tested for their ability to support yeast cell viability using a plasmid-shuffle complementation assay (see “Experimental Procedures”). Plasmid-shuffling of the mutants revealed that substitution mutants C45S/C48S and L52P did not support cell growth (Table I). The remaining 12 mutants, capable of supporting viability, were tested for their growth rates at several temperatures. Seven mutants were indistinguishable from the wild-type, whereas five mutants (W63P, W63R, R64A, F66D, and H71E) exhibited varying degrees of cold sensitivity, with the W63P and H71E mutants also displaying sensitivity to elevated temperature. The mutants were also analyzed on a variety of other growth media, but the relative growth properties on these media were similar to those observed with YPD (data not shown). To confirm that the observed growth phenotypes were due to inherent functional impairments and not due to instability of the mutant proteins, we examined the steady-state levels of the mutant proteins by immunoblotting. Polyhistidine-tagged versions of the mutant proteins expressed from the wild-type SUA7 promoter were introduced into the plasmid-shuffle strain. The resulting polyhistidine-tagged mutant strains were retested and confirmed to confer the same growth properties as the non-tagged versions (data not shown). Immunoblotting of whole-cell extracts was performed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the polyhistidine tag. As shown in Fig. 2, all of the mutants exhibited steady-state protein levels comparable to wild-type TFIIB. Taken together, these results suggest that the C45S/C48S double substitution in the second rubredoxin knuckle of the zinc ribbon, the L52P substitution in the C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon, and the W63P, W63R, R64A, F66D, and H71E substitutions in the adjacent homology block impair one or more essential functions of yeast TFIIB. To determine the transcriptional activity of the TFIIB mutants conferring altered in vivo properties, we expressed and purified recombinant polyhistidine-tagged versions of the mutant TFIIB proteins and tested their abilities to support basal and activated transcription using a TFIIB-depleted whole-cell extract. The C45S/C48S double substitution mutant did not support any detectable level of transcription above background, whereas the L52P and W63P mutants were severely compromised for transcriptional activity (Fig. 3). The H71E mutant was indistinguishable from wild-type TFIIB, but significantly, the W63P, W63R, R64A, and F66D mutant proteins all conferred preferential usage of the more downstream transcription start site. The observed defects in transcriptional activity of the mutant proteins are unlikely to be due to gross misfolding, as all of the recombinant mutant proteins were competent to form stable TBP·TFIIB·DNA ternary complexes in a gel mobility-shift assay (data not shown). In addition, all of the mutant proteins that supported some basal transcription also supported a strong response to the transcriptional activator GAL4-VP16 (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that the second rubredoxin knuckle and C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon are critical motifs for basal transcription activity, whereas the adjacent homology block participates in transcription start site selection. The results of the in vitro transcription assays revealed that several of the mutants displayed an alteration in transcription start site selection on the CYC1 promoter. To confirm and extend these results, we examined in vivo start site utilization at the ADH1 and CYC1 promoters in the mutant strains. For comparison, we also analyzed RNA from strains containing the E62K and R64E substitution mutants, shown previously to alter start site utilization (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the in vitroresults, mutants W63P, R64A, and F66D displayed a downstream shift in start site selection from both the CYC1 and ADH1promoters, whereas the shifts observed for mutant W63R were less pronounced (Fig. 4). In previous work, we identified a substitution mutant in the C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon (L50D) that was unable to bind purified yeast RNAPIIin vitro (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although this result suggests that the zinc ribbon is involved in the interaction between TFIIB and RNAPII, additional mutants in the zinc ribbon would further establish its participation in RNAPII binding. Therefore, we determined the ability of the N-terminal mutants to form stable complexes with purified RNAPII using a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The C45S/C48S and L52P mutants did not form stable complexes with RNAPII, whereas the remaining mutants did complex with RNAPII, with the W63P protein exhibiting only slight impairment (Fig. 5). To confirm participation of the N-terminal region of yeast TFIIB in stable RNAPII binding, we tested the ability of recombinant core domain (residues 119–346) to form stable complexes with RNAPII. Full-length wild-type or L50D TFIIB protein was included in the binding reactions to act as internal positive and negative controls for stable RNAPII binding, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6, the core domain of TFIIB did not detectably bind RNAPII in these assays. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the second rubredoxin knuckle and the C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon in the N-terminal region of TFIIB are involved in the direct interaction between TFIIB and RNAPII.Figure 6The core domain of yeast TFIIB does not detectably bind RNAPII. Binding reactions contained 35 ng of recombinant core TFIIB (residues 119–346), 50 ng of wild-type or L50D proteins as positive or negative internal controls, respectively, and 500 ng of purified RNAPII where indicated. The input TFIIB proteins (50% of total) and the precipitates (50% of total) were analyzed by precipitation and immunoblotting as described in the legend to Fig. 5. The RNAPII-independent species of greater and lower molecular weight than TFIIB correspond to the heavy and light chains of the 8WG16 mouse IgG, respectively, which weakly cross-react with the goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The minor species in lanes 1 and3 that co-migrates with core domain is a degradation product of the full-length proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In this work, we have analyzed the in vivo and in vitro properties of 14 site-directed substitution mutants in the conserved N-terminal region of yeast TFIIB. Several structural motifs were targeted for mutagenesis, including the second rubredoxin knuckle and C-terminal β-strand of the zinc ribbon fold and an adjacent homology block that is conserved among seven eukaryotic species (Fig. 1). In vivo analyses revealed that two of the mutants, C45S/C48S and L52P, were incapable of supporting yeast cell growth, while an additional five mutants exhibited cold sensitivity and, in two cases, temperature sensitivity as well (Table I). In vitrotranscriptional analysis demonstrated that both the C45S/C48S and L52P mutant proteins were severely impaired in their ability to support basal transcription (Fig. 3). These transcriptional defects correlated with an inability of these two mutant proteins to form stable complexes with purified RNAPII in vitro (Fig. 5). Similarly, the core domain, which lacks the N-terminal region and the zinc ribbon, also failed to bind RNAPII (Fig. 6). These results, combined with our previous determination that the L50D mutant is impaired for RNAPII binding, strongly suggest that the zinc ribbon fold, and in particular the C-terminal β-strand of the ribbon, are critical structural motifs for stable interaction of TFIIB with RNAPII. Four of the five mutants that displayed conditional growth properties contain a substitution in the homology block adjacent to the zinc ribbon (Fig. 1). The one conditional mutant with a substitution outside of this homology block, H71E, exhibited a temperature-sensitive phenotype but was comparable to the wild-type with respect to transcription activity in vitro, RNAPII binding, and transcription start site selection. The precise biochemical defect of the H71E mutant protein remains to be determined. The four conditional mutants with a substitution in the homology block (W63R, W63P, R64A, and F66D) exhibited cold-sensitive phenotypes and a downstream shift in transcription start site selection both in vivo and in vitro (Table I, Figs. 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that multiple residues within the highly conserved homology block adjacent to the zinc ribbon participate in selection of transcription start sites. In previous work, Hampsey and co-workers reported that E62K or R78C mutations conferred downstream shifts in start site selection (18Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residue Glu-62 is also contained within this homology block, whereas Arg-78 is C-terminal to this block, but also is an invariant residue among seven species (Fig. 1). In ongoing studies, we have utilized a random PCR-generated mutant TFIIB library and a genetic selection scheme to directly select for TFIIB mutants conferring downstream shifts in start site selection. To date, all of the mutants identified in this selection contain substitutions of residues in the homology block adjacent to the zinc ribbon or of residues Arg-78 or Val-79. 2S. L. Faitar and A. S. Ponticelli, unpublished data. Our results demonstrate that two separable and adjacent functional domains in the N-terminal region of yeast TFIIB govern stable RNAPII binding and transcription start site selection (Fig. 7). Mutations that impair stable RNAPII binding, as determined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay, extend from the second rubredoxin knuckle of the zinc ribbon through the C-terminal β-strand of the ribbon to residue Glu-62. We suggest that mutation of the first rubredoxin knuckle of the zinc ribbon would also impair RNAPII binding, because it is highly likely that the integrity of the ribbon fold is required for proper RNAPII interaction. Mutations altering start site selection encompass residues Glu-62 to Phe-66, and also include the more C-terminal pair of conserved residues Arg-78 and Val-79. Mutants W63R, W63P, R64A, and F66D, all conferring downstream shifts in start site selection, were proficient for stable RNAPII binding. Moreover, the L52P mutant was defective for stable RNAPII binding, but the low level of transcription supported by this mutant protein initiated at normal start sites in vitro (Fig. 3). Thus, our results indicate that downstream shifts in start site selection are not caused by impairment in the stable association of TFIIB and RNAPII. It was reported previously that the E62K and R78C mutants, both conferring downstream shifts in start site selection, were impaired for RNAPII binding in a surface plasmon resonance assay (8Bushnell D.A. Bamdad C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20170-20174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We suggest that residue Glu-62 is involved in both start site selection and RNAPII binding, i.e. the adjacent domains for stable RNAPII binding and start site selection overlap at residue Glu-62. We have determined that substitutions of residue Arg-78 other than R78C, such as R78L, confer downstream shifts in start site selection without impairing stable RNAPII binding by our assay (7Bangur C.S. Pardee T.S. Ponticelli A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6784-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).2The failure of the R78C mutant to bind RNAPII perhaps results from the introduction of a cysteine residue adjacent to the zinc ribbon. The presence of this additional cysteine could interfere with normal coordination of zinc by the adjacent four cysteines in the zinc ribbon, thereby perturbing the ribbon structure and impairing RNAPII binding. The mechanism by which transcription start sites are selected by RNAPII remains to be determined. In higher eukaryotes, transcription initiation usually occurs at a discrete start site located 25–30 base pairs downstream of the TATA element. In contrast, transcription initiation in S. cerevisiae frequently occurs at multiple start sites within a window of 30–120 base pairs downstream of the TATA element (26Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1987; 21: 425-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 27Struhl K. Cell. 1987; 49: 295-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The window for transcription initiation inS. cerevisiae could result from preinitiation complexes that loop out a limited amount of intervening downstream DNA to interact with potential initiation sites. If so, TFIIB mutants could confer downstream shifts in start site selection by altering preinitiation complex structure so as to impair the ability to loop out shorter segments of DNA, thereby impairing the ability of the complexes to utilize start sites closer to the TATA element. However, it has been reported that promoter melting for the S. cerevisiae GAL1and GAL10 genes in vivo is comparable to other eukaryotes, occurring approximately 20 base pairs downstream of the TATA element (28Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The extent of promoter melting appears to be independent of the distance between the TATA box and the transcription start sites, suggesting that the positioning and subsequent promoter melting of S. cerevisiae preinitiation complexes is similar to mammalian preinitiation complexes. Thus, transcription initiation in the downstream window from S. cerevisiae TATA elements may be the result of a “scanning” polymerase (28Giardina C. Lis J.T. Science. 1993; 261: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). If start site selection in S. cerevisiae involves a scanning polymerase, upstream or downstream shifts in start site utilization could result from RNAPII with enhanced or diminished initiation site recognition, respectively. Upstream shifts in start site selection have been observed both in vitro and in vivo with yeast strains containing a deletion of the small RPB9 subunit of RNAPII or mutation of the C-terminal zinc-binding motif inRPB9 (29Hull M.W. McKune K. Woychik N.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Furter-Graves E.M. Hall B.D. Furter R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4932-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of the RPB9subunit might alter the structure of polymerase on the DNA such that initiation sites are more efficiently recognized early in the scanning process. Conversely, downstream shifts, conferred by mutations in TFIIB or the RPB1 subunit of RNAPII (32Berroteran R.W. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be a consequence of a polymerase with diminished start site recognition. TFIIB might function in start site selection as a component of the scanning polymerase complex and assist in initiation site recognition and/or utilization (18Pinto I. Wu W.H. Na J.G. Hampsey M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30569-30573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If so, mutations that impair the stable association of TFIIB and RNAPII might produce unstable scanning complexes, resulting in alterations in start site selection. Although it remains possible that TFIIB is part of a scanning polymerase complex, our results demonstrate that most mutations that confer downstream shifts in start site selection do not affect stable association of TFIIB and RNAPII. Moreover, the L50D and L52P mutants, defective for stable RNAPII binding yet able to support low levels of transcription, support initiation at normal start sites. Therefore, if a scanning polymerase is involved in start site selection, our results are more consistent with TFIIB conferring properties for initiation site recognition upon RNAPII at the time of preinitiation complex assembly. In this model, the zinc ribbon of TFIIB has the major function in the stable interaction with RNAPII, whereas the adjacent homology block may interact with RNAPII in a more subtle manner to affect start site selection. Such an interaction between the homology block of TFIIB and RNAPII could affect the conformation of the polymerase on the DNA, thereby affecting subsequent start site recognition upon the onset of scanning. Continued biochemical analyses of the TFIIB mutants described here should provide additional insight into the mechanism of transcription start site selection and the role played by TFIIB.

https://openalex.org/W2157299631,"We determined the specificity of two hamster monoclonal antibodies and a sheep polyclonal antiserum against heparan sulfate proteoglycan isolated from rat glomerular basement membrane. The antibodies were characterized by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on various basement membrane components and immunoprecipitation with heparan sulfate proteoglycan with or without heparitinase pre-treatment. These experiments showed that the antibodies specifically recognize approximately 150-, 105-, and 70-kDa core proteins of rat glomerular basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Recently, we showed that agrin is a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan in the glomerular basement membrane (Groffen, A. J. A., Ruegg, M. A., Dijkman, H. B. P. M., Van der Velden, T. J., Buskens, C. A., van den Born, J., Assmann, K. J. M., Monnens, L. A. H., Veerkamp, J. H., and van den Heuvel, L. P. W. J. (1998) J. Histochem. Cytochem. 46, 19–27). Therefore, we tested whether our antibodies recognize agrin. To this end, we evaluated staining of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with constructs encoding full-length or the C-terminal half of rat agrin by analysis on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Both hamster monoclonals and the sheep antiserum clearly stained cells transfected with the construct encoding full-length agrin, whereas wild type cells and cells transfected with the construct encoding the C-terminal part of agrin were not recognized. A panel of previously characterized monoclonals, directed against C-terminal agrin, clearly stained cells transfected with either of the constructs but not wild type cells. This indicates that both hamster monoclonals and the sheep antiserum recognize epitopes on the N-terminal half of agrin. By immunohistochemistry on rat renal tissue, we compared distribution of N-terminal agrin with that of C-terminal agrin. The monoclonal antibodies against C-terminal agrin stained almost exclusively the glomerular basement membrane, whereas the anti-N-terminal agrin antibodies recognized all renal basement membranes, including tubular basement membranes. Based on these results, we hypothesize that full-length agrin is predominantly expressed in the glomerular basement membrane, whereas in most other renal basement membranes a truncated isoform of agrin is predominantly found that misses (part of) the C terminus, which might be due to alternative splicing and/or posttranslational processing. The possible significance of this finding is discussed.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) 1The abbreviations used are: HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; HS, heparan sulfate; BM, basement membrane; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; mAb, monclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; IF, immunofluorescence; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; FACS fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MuSK, muscle-specific kinase. are composed of a core protein to which anionic heparan sulfate (HS) side chains are attached. Apart from its presence in basement membranes (BMs), HSPG is found in other extracellular matrices and on many, if not all, cell surfaces (1Gallagher J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1201-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 2David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 3Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D.

The first extracellular matrix HSPG that was isolated (from mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma), characterized, and cloned was perlecan, named after its beads-on-a-string-like appearance in rotary shadowing electron microscopy (4Noonan D.M.

Different isoforms of perlecan have been found, which appear to be the result of alternative splicing (7Joseph S.J. Ford M.D. Barth C. Portbury S. Bartlett P.F. Nurcombe V. Greferath U. Development. 1996; 122: 3443-3452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Noonan D.M. Hassell J.R. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Agrin is another extracellular matrix HSPG that is not related to perlecan (9Hagen S.G. Michael A.F. Butkowski R.J. J. Biol.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Agrin was first isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo (11Godfrey E.W. Nitkin R.M. Wallace B.G. Rubin L.L. McMahan U.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 615-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and was recently identified as an HSPG (12Tsen G. Halfter W. Kroger S. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3392-3399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). During formation of the neuromuscular junction, motor neurons provide a number of signals that promote the differentiation of the post-synaptic membrane. An early signal is the secretion of specific isoforms of agrin and their incorporation into the basal lamina. Agrin initiates the clustering of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and other components of the muscle cell surface at the site of contact with axons of motor neurons (13Bowe M.A. Fallon J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 14Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H.

Cell. 1991; 67: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The structure of the agrin molecule and the functions of the various domains is extensively studied and presently well understood (17Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The C terminus of agrin contains several homology regions with the G-domain of laminin and four epidermal growth factor-like repeats (18Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The binding site of agrin to α-dystroglycan is located on the C terminus as well. Agrin binds to α-dystroglycan via its laminin G repeats (19Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a heparin/HS binding site is located on the C terminus and binding of heparin or HS prevents clustering of the acetylcholine receptors, indicating that HSPGs mediate this activity (20Hopf C. Hoch W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 1170-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Hirano Y. Kidokoro Y. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wallace B.G. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 3576-3582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most alternative splicing sites have been identified in the C terminus, three on rat agrin called x, y, and z and two on chick and Torpedo agrin called A and B, corresponding to rat y and z. This alternative splicing affects the activity of agrin to cluster acetylcholine receptors. The most active forms only occur in neural tissue, whereas the isoforms from non-neural tissue are less active (14Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 23Godfrey E.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Hoch W. Ferns M.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This suggests that splicing is regulated in a tissue-specific manner. The N-terminus of agrin contains nine domains homologous to the Kazal family of protease inhibitors and several laminin III homology regions (18Rupp F. Payan D.G. Magill-Solc C. Cowan D.M. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1991; 6: 811-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). On the N-terminal half of agrin, several attachment sites for HS side chains are found. Up until now, only one alternative splicing site has been found in the N-terminus. The insert on the N-terminal half is required for binding to the extracellular matrix which is mediated by laminin (26Denzer A.J. Gesemann M. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. J.

Ferns M. Campanelli J.T. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1993; 11: 479-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and the agrin protein has been demonstrated to be a basal lamina component in many tissues including kidney during early development (29Godfrey E.W.

Recently, we have shown the presence of agrin in the glomerular basement membrane (glomerular BM) in adult human kidney (30Groffen A.J.A. Ruegg M.A. Dijkman H.B.P.M. van der Velden T.J. Buskens C.A. van den Born J. Assmann K.J.M. Monnens L.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we raised and characterized two hamster monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and a sheep polyclonal antiserum against rat glomerular BM HSPG. The specificity of the mAbs is studied on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that are transfected with constructs coding for full-length agrin or the C-terminal half of agrin. These studies showed that these antibodies recognize epitopes on the N-terminal half of agrin. The staining on rat kidney tissue of these mAbs is compared with that of different mAbs against well-defined epitopes on the C terminus of agrin. These experiments suggest that most renal BMs except the glomerular BM express a truncated isoform of agrin that lacks (part of) the C-terminal half due to alternative splicing and/or posttranslational processing. We speculate on the possible involvement of the C terminus of agrin in glomerular function. For immunization, rat glomerular HSPG was isolated from rat glomeruli (31van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans were isolated by guanidine extraction, dialysis against urea, DEAE ion-exchange chromatography, chondroitinase ABC digestion (Sigma) and by fast protein liquid Q-Sepharose chromatography. For immunoprecipitation, HSPG was isolated from rat glomerular BM obtained by a detergent procedure (32van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. van den Born J. van de Velden T.J.A.M. Veerkamp J.H. Monnens L.A.H. Schroder C.H. Berden J.H.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), from which proteoglycans were isolated as described (31van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J.

All procedures were performed at 4 °C in the presence of 10 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine HCl, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Male Chinese hamsters were immunized with rat glomerular HSPG according to a previously described protocol (31van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 115-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Hybridomas were screened in indirect immunofluorescence (IF) on rat kidney cryostat sections (see below) for a staining pattern comparable with the staining of previously described mAbs against human glomerular BM HSPG, which primarily stain the glomerular BM in a bright linear pattern and the tubular BMs to a lesser extent (33van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two hybridomas were found to meet these criteria, called MI-90 and MI-91, and were subcloned twice by limiting dilution so that all subclones displayed the same reactivity pattern. From these two clones, ascites production was elicited in nude mice. A sheep was immunized intracutaneously with rat glomerular HSPG according to a previously described protocol (32van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. van den Born J. van de Velden T.J.A.M. Veerkamp J.H.

J. 1989; 264: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and after the last booster the sheep was bled and the serum (called GR-14) was collected. The reactivity of the antibodies with various BM components was determined in ELISA as described (34Raats C.J.I. Bakker M.A.H. van den Born J. Berden J.H.M. J. Biol.

Primary antibodies MI-90 and MI-91 were diluted 1:100, and GR-14 was diluted 1:1000. The following peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in a dilution of 1:500 were used: rabbit anti-hamster IgG (Nordic, Tilburg, The Netherlands) for mAb MI-90, goat anti-hamster IgG (Cappel-Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium) for mAb MI-91, and rabbit anti-sheep Ig (Cappel) for GR-14. Rat glomerular BM HSPG was labeled with 125I according to the chloramine T-method (35Greenwood F.C. Hunter W.M. Glover J.S. Biochem. J. 1963; 89: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6742) Google Scholar). Part of the sample was treated with heparitinase (EC 4.2.2.8; from Sigma) 1 unit/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 6 h at 43 °C. Radiolabeled HSPG was pre-absorbed with protein G-Sepharose CL-4B to remove eventual radiolabeled IgG. Normal hamster IgG and culture supernatants of mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 were incubated with protein G-Sepharose, to which goat anti-hamster IgG (Cappel) was immobilized. Normal mouse IgM (MOPC-104E; Bionetics, Kensington, MD) and mouse anti-HS side chain mAb JM-403 (31van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M.

Normal sheep IgG and sheep antiserum GR-14 were directly coupled to protein G-Sepharose. After washing with PBS-Tween, the immobilized antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C with radiolabeled rat glomerular BM HSPG (with or without heparitinase pretreatment). After washing in PBS-Tween, sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol was added, the sample was boiled for 3 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 7% homogenous gel. The gel was dried and used for autoradiography for 3 days at −70 °C. To investigate the reactivity of our antibodies with agrin, we used CHO-cells, stably transfected with constructs encoding full-length rat agrin or the C-terminal half of agrin (construct N1, amino acids 1137–1940) (17Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured as described (17Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and continuously selected for the presence of the construct by Geneticin (G418, 500 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc., Paisly, Scotland). Untransfected CHO cells were used as a negative control. On cytospins of CHO cells, indirect IF was performed with anti-HSPG mAbs MI-90, MI-91 antiserum GR-14, and anti-agrin mAb Agr-131 (17Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Harrison S. Scheller R.H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2814-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (Table I) as described for the kidney cryostat sections (see below). For analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), samples of 100 μl of cell suspension containing 5 × 106 cells were permeabilized and fixed with 1 ml of PermeaFix (Ortho Diagnostic, Beerse, The Netherlands) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cells were incubated with 100 μl of primary antibody (Table I) for 30 min at 0 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at 0 °C. The cells were washed twice and kept in 1% paraformaldehyde until analysis on a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). Mean fluorescence was determined on a scale between 0 and 1024, and values were corrected for staining by the secondary antibody alone.Table IPrimary and secondary antibodies used in indirect immunofluorescencePrimary antibodyAntigenDilutionSecondary antibodyDilutionSourceMI-90Rat glom HSPG1:400Goat anti-hamster IgG1:50Jackson, West Grove, PAMI-91Rat glom HSPG1:800Goat anti-hamster IgG1:200Cappel-Organon Teknika, Turnhout, BelgiumGR-14Rat glom HSPG1:800Rabbit anti-sheep IgG1:100Southern, Birmingham, ALAgr-30, −33, −131, −137, −435Rat agrin1:1000Sheep anti-mouse IgG F(ab)21:500Organon Teknika, Turnhout, Belgium Open table in a new tab Indirect IF was performed as described previously (34Raats C.J.I.

To evaluate the specificity of the hamster and sheep antibodies for the HSPG core protein, pretreatment of rat kidney cryostat sections was performed by incubating nonfixed sections with 0.25 units/ml heparitinase in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 2 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactivity of hamster mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 and sheep antiserum GR-14 in ELISA with different BM components is shown in Fig. 1. For MI-90, a clear reactivity was observed with both rat glomerular BM HSPG and human glomerular BM HSPG. For MI-91, a reactivity was observed with rat glomerular BM HSPG, but not with human glomerular BM HSPG. Neither of the mAbs bound to rat L2-laminin, mouse fibronectin, mouse collagen IV, or HS. Antiserum GR-14 bound to rat glomerular BM HSPG, human glomerular BM HSPG, and to a lesser extent to rat L2-laminin, but not to the other BM components. After immunoprecipitation of intact, 125I-labeled rat glomerular BM HSPG with hamster mAbs MI-90, MI-91, and sheep antiserum GR-14, gel electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a broad smear with a molecular mass larger than 220 kDa, which might have resulted from different core proteins and/or different extent of glycosylation (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 3, and7). This is in agreement with previous findings (32van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. van den Born J. van de Velden T.J.A.M. Veerkamp J.H. Monnens L.A.H. Schroder C.H. Berden J.H.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The same band is seen with the mouse anti-HS side chain mAb JM-403 (lane 5) (33van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Berden J.H.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 89-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To assess the molecular mass of the HSPG core protein(s), HSPG was treated before immunoprecipitation with heparitinase to degrade the HS glycosaminoglycan side chains. This resulted in a major band of ∼170 kDa and several bands with molecular masses of ∼105 and 70 kDa, which were equal for MI-90, MI-91, and GR-14 (lanes 9, 10, and 14). mAb JM-403 directed against HS side chain, however, is negative after treatment with heparitinase, as expected (lane 12). Non-relevant hamster IgG (lanes 1 and 8), mouse IgM (lanes 4 and 11), and normal sheep IgG (lanes 6 and 13) with the same Ig concentration served as negative controls. These results indicate that the mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 and the sheep antiserum GR-14 are directed against the core protein(s) of an HSPG present in rat glomerular BM. To evaluate recognition of rat agrin by our antibodies, indirect IF was performed on CHO cells transfected with constructs encoding full-length agrin (37Campanelli J.T. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1994; 77: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or the C-terminal half of agrin (N1) (25Ferns M.J. Campanelli J.T. Hoch W. Scheller R.H. Hall Z. Neuron. 1993; 11: 491-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Binding of antibodies was evaluated either microscopically on cytospins or by FACS analysis. First, microscopical evaluation of cytospins showed that both hamster anti-HSPG mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 and sheep anti-HSPG GR-14 recognized full-length agrin as expressed by CHO cells transfected with full-length agrin (Fig. 3, A-C), whereas they did not bind to the C-terminal half of agrin as expressed by cells transfected with construct N1 (Fig. 3, E-G, TableII). Neither did they bind to wild type CHO cells. The positive control anti-agrin mAb Agr-131 bound to both full-length agrin and to the C-terminal half of agrin as expressed by cells transfected with full-length agrin or construct N1, respectively (Fig. 3, D and H, Table II) To confirm this crucial conclusion, we also performed fluorescence analysis by FACS and quantified mean fluorescence intensity. As shown in Table II, full-length agrin expressed by CHO cells is recognized by both hamster mAbs and the sheep antiserum. These antibodies, however, were negative on N1-transfected cells and on wild type CHO cells. Anti-agrin mAb Agr-131, however, recognized both full-length and C-terminal agrin. These results indicate that hamster mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 and the sheep antiserum GR-14 recognize epitopes on the N-terminal half of agrin.Table IIStaining of agrin-expressing CHO cells by MI-90, MI-91, GR-14, and Agr-131AntibodyWild typeFull-length agrinC-terminal half agrinCytospinFACSCytospinFACSCytospinFACSMI-90−0+++306−0MI-91−7+++412−0GR-14±54++178±63Agr-131±51+++326++163Cytospins or FACS of CHO cells transfected with constructs coding for either full-length agrin or the C-terminal half of agrin or wild type CHO cells stained with hamster mAbs MI-90, MI-91, sheep antiserum GR-14, or anti-agrin mAb Agr-131.

In indirect IF, mAbs MI-90 and MI-91 stain most BMs in a linear way, the glomerular BM with the highest intensity (Fig. 4,A and B). This staining pattern closely resembles the staining of previously developed mAbs directed against human glomerular BM HSPG (38van den Born J. van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. Bakker M.A.H. Veerkamp J.H. Assmann K.J.M. Weening J.J. Berden J.H.M. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: 454-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Only mAb MI-91 weakly stained Bowman's capsule and BMs of smooth muscle cells in arteries and arterioles. Both mAbs stained BMs of endothelial cells in blood vessels but not the mesangial matrix and peritubular capillaries. (Fig. 4, A andB) mAb MI-90 also stained human kidney cryostat sections, and mAb MI-91 also stained mouse kidney cryostat sections. (TableIII). The polyclonal antiserum GR-14 stained the glomerular BM, all tubular BMs, and BMs of endothelial cells in a bright linear way but not the mesangial matrix nor the peritubular capillaries. Bowman's capsule, and the smooth muscle cells in arteries and arterioles were stained weakly (Fig. 4 C). This staining pattern is similar to that of a previously described polyclonal antibody directed to human glomerular BM HSPG (32van den Heuvel L.P.W.J. van den Born J. van de Velden T.J.A.M. Veerkamp J.H. Monnens L.A.H. Schroder C.H. Berden J.H.M. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GR-14 also stained human and mouse kidney cryostat sections. (Table III) The staining pattern of MI-90, MI-91 and GR-14 could not be prevented by pre-treatment of the sections with heparitinase, indicating that the antibodies are directed against the core protein of HSPG. mAb JM-403 directed against the HS side chain, however, was negative after treatment with heparitinase, as expected. This confirms our data from the immunoprecipitation with heparitinase-pretreated glomerular BM HSPG (Fig. 2, lanes 8–14).Table IIIKidney staining of agrin by MI-90, MI-91, GR-14, and Agr-131AntibodyRatHumanMouseGBMTBMMMBCPTCVSMMI-90++++/++−−−−+−MI-91++++/++−±−±−+GR-14++++/++−±−±++Agr-131+++−/±−−−−+NDIndirect immunofluorescence of MI-90, MI-91, GR-14, or Agr-131 on rat, human, and mouse renal tissue.

Chem. 269, 15195–15203) reported that potassium depletion of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse macrophages induced by the potassium ionophore, nigericin, leads to the rapid release of mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β). We have now shown a similar phenomenon in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. Rapid secretion of mature, 17-kDa IL-1β occurred, in the presence of nigericin (4–16 μm). No effects on the release of tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, or proIL-1β were seen. Addition of the irreversible interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (ICE) inhibitor, Z-Val-Ala-Asp-dichlorobenzoate, or a radicicol analog, inhibited nigericin-induced mature IL-1β release and activation of p45 ICE precursor. The radicicol analog itself did not inhibit ICE, but markedly, and very rapidly depleted intracellular levels of 31-kDa proIL-1β. By contrast, dexamethasone, cycloheximide, and the Na+/H+ antiporter inhibitor, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride, had no effect on nigericin-induced release of IL-1β. We have therefore shown conclusively, for the first time, that nigericin-induced release of IL-1β is dependent upon activation of p45 ICE processing.

ICE itself is produced as a 45-kDa precursor, which has recently been shown to be converted autocatalytically to an active p10/p20 heterodimer (2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R.

The physiological control of ICE processing, and hence IL-1β conversion and secretion, is still unknown. Studies by Perregaux et al.(3Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1294-1303PubMed Google Scholar, 4Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that IL-1β processing is controlled by intracellular potassium ion concentration. Mouse peritoneal macrophages stimulated with LPS produce massive amounts of cell-associated, 31-kDa IL-1β. Upon addition of the K+/H+ ionophore, nigericin, rapid and complete processing of intracellular IL-1β occurred with the appearance of mature 17-kDa IL-1β in the medium. Similar effects were reported using human peripheral blood monocytes. Although in these studies marked leakage of the cytoplasmic enzyme, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) occurred, suggesting substantial cell damage, it was argued that the effect of nigericin was not due simply to lysis, inasmuch as, unlike the effects of hypotonic shock, at no time were significant levels of proIL-1β detected in the culture medium. Furthermore, the nigericin-induced 17-kDa IL-1β was shown to have the expected N-terminal sequence. These results, together with studies by Walev et al. (5Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) showing that high extracellular concentrations of K+ or combinations of K+-channel blockers prevented the physiological release of IL-1β, suggest that a net reduction of intracellular K+ion concentration is necessary for the processing of proIL-1β. Both Perregaux et al. (4Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Walev et al. (5Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) speculated that a reduction of K+ ion concentration might activate ICE or promote the processing of pro-ICE. Alternatively, it was suggested that nigericin-induced K+ depletion alters the cytoplasmic compartmentalization of ICE and IL-1β. So far, however, there has not been any direct evidence that nigericin-induced release of IL-1β is ICE-dependent. In the present study, we show that nigericin evokes a massive and rapid release of 17-kDa IL-1β from prestimulated THP-1 cells under conditions where LDH leakage is absent. Under these conditions, the nigericin-induced secretion of IL-1β is almost completely blocked by the irreversible ICE inhibitor, 2-valyl-alanyl-3(S)-3-amino-4-oxo-5-(2,6-dichlorobenzoyloxopentanoic) acid (Z-VAD-DCB) (6Loddick S.A. MacKenzie A. Rothwell N.J. Neuropharmacol. Neurotoxicol. 1996; 7: 1465-1468Google Scholar), as well as a radicicol analog (7Kastelic T. Schnyder J. Leutwiler A. Traber R. Streit B. Niggli H. MacKenzie A. Cheneval D. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), demonstrating the ICE dependence of the process. Z-VAD-DCB was synthesized in our laboratories and radicicol analog A, C20H24O8((7S,12S,13S)-(9Z,15E)-4,12,13-trihydroxy1,2-dimethoxy-7-methyl-8,12,13,14-tetrahydro-7H-6-oxabenzocyclotetradecene-5,11-dione), was isolated from the fungus strain F/87-2509.04. The chemical structures of both compounds are shown in Fig. 1. Cells from the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 110 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2 g/liter NaHCO3. Heat-treated fetal bovine serum (5%) was added before use. The cells were grown to a density of 5 × 105/ml and then stimulated with interferon-γ (100 units/ml). Three hours later, LPS (5 μg/ml) was added. This time point was designated time 0. Incubation continued for an additional 40 h. The media were then removed and clarified by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. LDH measurements were performed immediately (8Schnyder J. Bollinger P. Payne T. Agents Actions. 1990; 30: 350-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Cytokine assays were performed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (IL-1β, Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI; proIL-1β, Cistron, Biotechnology, Pine Brook, NJ; IL-6 and TNF-α, Innogenetics, Zwijndrecht, Belgium). DNA was assayed fluorimetrically using the method of Kapuscinsiki et al. (9Kapuscinski J. Skoczylas B. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Refolding and the induction of autoprocessing was carried out as described before (2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.-P MacKenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with the exception that no glutathione (GSH) was present during the dialysis step. A 3-h incubation at room temperature in the presence of 25 mm GSH following dialysis led to the induction of autocatalytic processing. Radicicol analog A was added at 5 μm final concentration to this last step. Cations, where mentioned, were present at the indicated concentrations in the refolding mixture, the dialysis buffer, as well as during the last incubation at room temperature. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-N-terminal p45 ICE or anti-p10 ICE subunit antibodies raised in our laboratories and shown to cross-react with p45 ICE. Detection was performed using an anti-rabbit IgG-POD (Sigma) with the chemiluminescence detection system of Boehringer Mannheim. Western blots were analyzed with a Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer 300A using Image Quant software. A fluorogenic Z-Val-Ala-Asp-aminomethyl coumarin (Z-VAD-AMC) substrate was used to assay activity. Free AMC, which is cleaved off directly by ICE, was detected using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and monitoring the emission at 450 nm. Assay conditions were as described in Refs. 1Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K. Molineaux S.M. Weidner J.R. Aunins J. Elliston K.O. Ayala J.M.

Preliminary experiments showed that when THP-1 cells, prestimulated with 5 μg/ml LPS for 39.5 h, were exposed for 30 min to nigericin, a consistent, rapid, concentration-dependent release of IL-1β into the medium occurred (Fig. 2 A). This increase in total cumulative IL-1β in the medium varied by 2–5-fold in different experiments. Measurement of IL-1β levels at 30, 39.5, and again at 40 h in control cultures (no nigericin), showed that secreted IL-1β levels were at their peak and that IL-1β release over this time was negligible. Nigericin thus stimulated a massive and rapid release of IL-1β over and above the normal steady-state levels. When the ICE inhibitor Z-VAD-DCB was added to the cultures at 39 h (30 min before nigericin), it was found to substantially block the nigericin-induced IL-1β release (Fig. 2 A and TableI). The effect of nigericin was not caused by cytotoxicity because, as shown in Fig. 2 B, even at the highest concentration used (16 μm), there was no increase in LDH leakage over the 30 min period of exposure. Because longer exposure to nigericin eventually does lead to signs of cytotoxicity, the 30-min exposure was adhered to for all experiments. The specificity of the effect on IL-1β is further indicated in Fig. 2 B, as TNF-α levels were unaltered by nigericin even at the highest concentration. Additional studies (results not shown) indicated that nigericin does also not affect the amount of IL-6 secreted by THP-1 cells.Table IEffects of inhibitors on IL-1β secretion and intracellular and extracellular proIL-1β accumulationControlZ-VAD-DCBNigericinNigericin + Z-VAD-DCBDexNigericin + DexRadicicol analog ANigericin + radicicol analog ASecreted IL-1β1.06 ± 0.061.09 ± 0.07 (NS)2.15 ± 0.16***1.33 ± 0.06 (NS)1.25 ± 0.05 (NS)2.17 ± 0.06***1.19 ± 0.09 (NS)0.87 ± 0.01 (NS)Intracellular proIL-1β5.65 ± 0.165.27 ± 0.54** (NS)5.63 ± 0.11 (NS)4.85 ± 0.12**4.90 ± 0.01*4.24 ± 0.11***3.48 ± 0.37***3.61 ± 0.08***Extracellular proIL-1β0.38 ± 0.030.39 ± 0.03 (NS)0.96 ± 0.11 (NS)1.07 ± 0.06*0.38 ± 0.02 (NS)0.98 ± 0.05 (NS)0.39 ± 0.03 (NS)0.27 ± 0.02 (NS)THP-1 cells were treated as described in Fig. 2.

In a second series of experiments we compared the effects of Z-VAD-DCB, dexamethasone, cycloheximide and radicicol analog A, a compound previously demonstrated to reduce IL-1β production by causing mRNA instability (7Kastelic T.

Leutwiler A. Schnyder J. Pharmacol. Commun. 1996; 7: 301-308Google Scholar), on nigericin-induced IL-1β release. Tables I and II show that, whereas Z-VAD-DCB was able to inhibit nigericin-induced release of IL-1β, dexamethasone or cycloheximide were without effect. The radicicol analog also blocked the effects of nigericin. Intracellular levels of unprocessed 31-kDa IL-1β were measured in cell lysates. Table I shows that Z-VAD-DCB had no significant effect on intracellular levels of proIL-1β. By contrast, both the translational inhibitor, cycloheximide (Table II), and dexamethasone (Table I) caused a statistically significant decrease, in intracellular proIL-1β only in the nigericin-treated cells. A third pattern of inhibition was observed with radicicol analog A, which markedly inhibited the levels of proIL-1β in both control and nigericin-treated cells. Although no increase in LDH leakage was detected, we wished to determine whether any proIL-1β was released from the cells, which would indicate that the nigericin-induced release of 17-kDa IL-1β was simply a result of cellular membrane damage. The results also show that, in control cells, only very small amounts of proIL-1β are released into the medium and that none of the test compounds alone affected the amount released. Nigericin, however, more than doubled the concentration of proIL-1β in the medium, suggesting that a degree of non-physiological leakage of proIL-1β did occur. The release of proIL-1β was unaffected by either the ICE inhibitor, Z-VAD-DCB, cycloheximide or dexamethasone; however, radicicol analog A caused a marked reduction in release.Table IIEffects of cycloheximide and nigericin on IL-1β secretion and intracellular and extracellular proIL-1β accumulationControlNigericinCHXNigericin + CHXSecreted IL-1β2.78 ± 0.165.68 ± 0.3***2.81 ± 0.08 (NS)6.19 ± 0.24**Intracellular proIL-1β8.8 ± 0.367.31 ± 0.18***8.18 ± 0.13 (NS)5.55 ± 0.27***Extracellular proIL-1β0.65 ± 0.031.79 ± 0.09**0.69 ± 0.01 (NS)2.03 ± 0.04***THP-1 cells were treated as described in Fig. 2.

Because the release of mature 17-kDa IL-1β appeared to be dependent on ICE activity, we next investigated whether there was evidence that p45 ICE precursor was being activated by nigericin. THP-1 cells were treated with a combination of 100 units/ml interferon-γ and 5 μg/ml LPS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Z-VAD-DCB (1 μm) or radicicol analog A (1 μm) were given 30 min prior to nigericin (39 h after LPS addition). Following the addition of 16 μm nigericin (39.5 h after LPS addition) for the final 30 min of incubation, a marked and statistically significant decrease in the amount of p45 ICE as determined by Western blotting was observed, suggesting that processing of p45 ICE had indeed been induced (Fig. 3, A andB). This correlated well with the stimulation of IL-1β release by 16 μm nigericin in these experiments (Fig. 3 C). In the presence of the ICE inhibitor, which we had shown previously to inhibit autocatalytic processing of p45 ICE in a cell-free system (2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.-P MacKenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the effect of nigericin was reversed. The same was the case for radicicol analog A. Radicicol analog A can also affect the autocatalytic processing of p45 ICE. As Fig. 4 A shows, radicicol analog A (5 μm) when given at the same time as glutathione (GSH, 25 mm), which induces autocatalysis (2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R.

Unlike Z-VAD-DCB, however, radicicol analog A does not inhibit active, processed ICE in an isolated enzyme assay (results not shown).Figure 4Inhibition of p45 ICE processing by radicicol analog A.

We therefore measured recombinant ICE activity in the presence of a range of K+ ion concentrations from zero to approximately 2-fold intracellular. It was found that 200 mm K+causes 50% inhibition of ICE activity (results not shown). However, this was not ion-specific, and similar effects were seen with Na+ and Ca2+ at comparable ionic strengths. We next looked at the effect of cations on ICE processing. Using recombinant p45 ICE under reducing conditions where autocatalytic processing is known to take place (see Ref. 2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.-P MacKenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”), the appearance of the p10 subunit and the resulting ICE activity in the presence of various cations was measured. Again an inhibitory effect was observed (TableIII). This result clearly demonstrates that K+ ions do inhibit p45 ICE autoprocessing. In contrast to cellular systems, where monensine, A23187 (3Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1294-1303PubMed Google Scholar), and amiloride (see below) have no effect, inhibition of autoprocessing in vitrois not ion-specific.Table IIIInfluence of cations on in vitro p45 ICE processingIon concentrationICE p10 levelsICE activityaActivities were assayed at dilutions resulting in ion concentrations which had no effect on ICE activity as determined in separate experiments (results not shown).mmrelative OD% controlControl − GSH000Control + GSH00.85100K+250.7550500.53351500.3714Na+250.6857500.53351500.3021Ca2+120.5464250.2135750.077Mg2+120.5757250.2828750.167Recombinant human p45 ICE was activated by 25 mm GSH as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of different ions at various concentrations.

Western blots were performed with a rabbit anti-human p10 ICE subunit antibody, and relative band intensities were determined by digitized imaging. Based on findings that 5-dimethyl amiloride was able to suppress IL-1β secretion from LPS-activated monocytes with an IC50 = 3.5 μm, it was reported that extracellular Na+ and high intracellular pH was required for IL-1β secretion (12Orlinska U. Newton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1073-C1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was possible, therefore, that the effects of nigericin were caused by a secondary compensatory influx of Na+ ions. If this were indeed so, one would expect 5-dimethyl amiloride to reverse or neutralize the effects of nigericin. We thus tested IL-1β secretion from THP-1 cells in the presence of both nigericin and 5-dimethyl amiloride given at the same time. No reversal of the effects of nigericin by 5-dimethyl amiloride up to 30 μm was observed, suggesting that nigericin exerts its effects directly through K+ efflux. It may well be that the efflux of K+ is a stronger signal for ICE activation than extracellular Na+ levels or changes in intracellular pH. It is also quite possible that THP-1 cells react differently to these changes, because 5-dimethyl amiloride, when given alone at 30 μm before LPS stimulation, decreased mature IL-1β secretion only slightly, which is in contrast to the strong inhibition reported on monocytes (12Orlinska U. Newton R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C1073-C1080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study expands previous findings that nigericin is able to specifically induce the release of mature IL-1β from mononucleic cells to THP-1 cells. The process was extremely rapid, with 2–5 times as much IL-1β being released in 30 min as the cumulative release of IL-1β over the previous 39.5 h. Unlike the studies of Perregauxet al. (3Perregaux D. Barberia J. Lanzetti A.J. Geoghegan K.F. Carty T.J. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1294-1303PubMed Google Scholar, 4Perregaux D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15195-15203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there was no evidence of cytotoxicity over the time course used, as indicated by the lack of any increased LDH in the medium. On a molar basis, over 80% of the IL-1β released by LPS-stimulated cells is in the processed 17-kDa form. Under the influence of nigericin, the ratio of released 17-kDa to 31-kDa IL-1β in the medium remains the same, further substantiating the conclusion that the increase is not a result of cell lysis or simple leakage. Furthermore, the lack of effect on other cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 (latter not shown) demonstrate that the effects are specific. When comparing intracellular levels of proIL-1β at 39 and 40 h after LPS stimulation no measurable increase could be observed (results not shown). Steady-state synthesis of proIL-1β at this time is apparently occurring at a very slow rate. Intracellular levels of proIL-1β were only affected by nigericin in the presence of inhibitors of de novo synthesis (dexamethasone and radicicol analog A, Table I; cycloheximide, Table II). The most likely explanation for a lack of an effect with nigericin alone is the presence of a homeostatic mechanism designed to maintain constant levels of intracellular proIL-1β. This would also explain why the presence of an ICE inhibitor does not increase intracellular proIL-1β levels. Because ICE inhibitors do not lead to a decrease in proIL-1β levels inside the cell, no signal is generated to induce an increase in the rate of proIL-1β synthesis. The addition of an irreversible ICE inhibitor, Z-VAD-DCB, substantially blocks the nigericin-induced release of mature IL-1β, suggesting that nigericin is dependent upon mechanisms that operate during the physiological release of IL-1β. Analyses of the cellular levels of p45 ICE by Western blotting clearly show that nigericin induces the autocatalytic processing of p45 ICE (Fig. 3). The nigericin-induced processing of p45 ICE is prevented in the presence of the ICE inhibitor, which is consistent with the observations that this inhibitor prevents the autocatalysis of recombinant p45 ICE in a cell-free system (2Ramage P. Cheneval D. Chvei M Graff P. Hemmig R. Heng R. Kocher H.-P MacKenzie A. Memmert K. Revesz L. Wishart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9378-9383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although Z-VAD-DCB also inhibits other caspases, ICE, with the exception of caspase 4 (which cleaves proIL-1β 250-fold less effectively), is the only caspase known to correctly cleave proIL-1β to its mature form (13Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Also, unlike other caspases, again with the exception of caspase 4, no enzyme has so far been described to process p45 ICE other than ICE itself whereasin vitro, ICE can also cleave pro-caspase 4. This, together with the inhibition of p45 ICE autoprocessing, but not p10/p20 ICE activity by radicicol analog A (see below), further reduces the likelihood of a nigericin-induced activation of an enzymatic cascade upstream of ICE. Not surprisingly, 1 nm dexamethasone (a concentration shown to give >80% inhibition of IL-1β secretion if added before LPS stimulation) and cycloheximide do not prevent nigericin-induced IL-1β processing indicating that nigericin induced secretion of IL-1β comes from a pre-existing pool of proIL-1β. Radicicol analog A had a profound effect on IL-1β levels. A 1-h exposure led to a dramatic reduction in intracellular proIL-1β. Previous studies (10Elford P.R. Dixon A.K. MacKenzie A.R. Leutwiler A. Schnyder J. Pharmacol. Commun. 1996; 7: 301-308Google Scholar) have shown that radicicol analog A induces the rapid degradation of cytokine mRNAs (including IL-1β), which have in common the AUUUA instability motif in the 3′-untranslated region. In contrast to dexamethasone and cycloheximide, the effect of radicicol analog A on released proIL-1β from nigericin-treated cells therefore reflects a drastically reduced pool of proIL-1β in the cells that is available for processing (Tables I and II). Because over the time period measured in our experiments there is no detectable increase in IL-1β secretion, or proIL-1β leakage in control cells, it is not surprising that no effect is seen with radicicol analog alone on the secretion of mature IL-1β or on extracellular levels of proIL-1β. The effect of radicicol analog A on the nigericin-induced release of mature IL-1β is twofold. First, as mentioned before, radicicol analog A induces rapid degradation of IL-1β mRNA and possibly also inhibits transcription and translation. Thus, in the presence of radicicol analog A, synthesis of proIL-1β is decreased. Because the rate of proIL-1β production is decreased and the rate of proIL-1β consumption either by export of processed IL-1β or intracellular degradation of proIL-1β, is unaffected by radicicol analog A, intracellular proIL-1β levels are expected to decrease whereas the levels of mature IL-1β secreted remain at the control levels because radicicol analog A does not inhibit pre-existing mature ICE. Therefore, also with the addition of nigericin, extracellular proIL-1β levels do not increase. Second, because radicicol analog A also blocks p45 ICE processing (Fig. 4) but does not inhibit ICE activity (results not shown), the increase in IL-1β secretion in the presence of nigericin is a result of the presence of more active ICE, a result of increased p45 ICE processing triggered by the lowering of K+ levels by nigericin. Radicicol analog A blocking p45 ICE processing inhibits the effects of nigericin, whereas cycloheximide, which also inhibits protein synthesis but does not inhibit ICE activity or ICE processing (results not shown), does not influence the effects of nigericin. So far, however, there are no clues as to how a reduction in K+ ion concentration may induce p45 ICE processing. Autoprocessing of p45 ICE, in vitro is not sensitive to K+ alone (Table III). Ionic strength-dependent inhibition of ICE activity in vitro was also seen (results not shown). Mature ICE was sensitive to salt concentrations equivalent to the intracellular concentration of potassium. Such concentrations caused approximately 50% inhibition of ICE activity using the synthetic substrate Z-VAD-AMC. However, this effect was not ion-specific, so it is unlikely that this explains the specific effects of reducing K+ ion concentration in whole cells. We have also eliminated the possibility that nigericin has a direct effect on ICE activity in a cell-free system (results not shown). Although it remains unclear how nigericin induces ICE processing, this effect does not appear to require metabolically active cells because nigericin-induced proIL-1β processing continued in azide-treated cells (results not shown). Whether K+ ion flux plays a role in the physiological processing of ICE and IL-1β secretion in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, is not clear. Walev et al. (5Walev I. Reske K. Palmer M. Valeva A. Bhakdi S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) showed that a variety of manipulations that resulted in reduced intracellular levels of K+ could trigger IL-1β processing. Furthermore, high extracellular concentrations of K+ could reverse these effects. Combinations of tetraethylammonium and 4-aminopyridine (potassium channel blockers) could also inhibit the physiological release of LPS-induced IL-1β. Because no single channel blocker was effective, even at high concentration, this suggests that multiple channels are involved and therefore potassium channel blockers are unlikely to be leads in the search for cytokine release inhibitors. Taken together, our results show that nigericin-induced K+efflux induces rapid p45 ICE processing leading to an increase in active ICE, which in turn results in a higher secretion of mature IL-1β. Because nigericin treatment specifically leads to mature IL-1β release, a better understanding of the mechanism by which K+ ions control p45 ICE activation and proIL-1β processing might lead to the identification of new anti-inflammatory drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2315012910,"Members of the Wnt family induce mouse mammary tumors and partially transform mammary epithelial cells in culture. However, their mechanism of transformation remains to be elucidated. In NIH3T3 mouse embryo fibroblasts, a standard transformation model, Wnt-1 and Wnt-2 were shown to induce altered properties including increased saturation density and growth in soft agar. Such cells also exhibited increased cell-cell adhesiveness. However, unlike oncogenes such as PDGFB or ras, Wnt-1 and -2 failed to induce detectable transformed foci following transfection, and stable NIH3T3 transfectants lacked tumor forming capacity. Wnt-1 and -2 transfectants exhibited increased uncomplexed, cytosolic beta-catenin, which was not observed with PDGFB, ras or erbB2 transfectants. In transient transfection, Wnt-1 and -2 induced a rapid increase in cytosolic beta-catenin but no detectable increase in the phosphorylated activated forms of MAP kinase. In contrast, ras was a potent activator of MAP kinase but had no effect on free beta-catenin levels. These findings establish that both Wnt signaling and pattern of growth alterations differ from those of oncogenes which activate proliferative signaling pathways in NIH3T3 cells."

Here we demonstrate that retinoic acid can induce the accumulation of αB-crystallin in N/N1003A lens cells and that retinoic acid receptor heterodimers (retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor; RAR/RXR) can transactivate LSR1 and LSR2 in cotransfection experiments. DNase I footprinting experiments demonstrated that purified RAR/RXR heterodimers will occupy sequences resembling retinoic acid response elements within LSR1 and LSR2. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using antibodies indicated that LSR1 and LSR2 can interact with endogenous RAR/RXR complexes in extracts of cultured lens cells. Pax-6 and RAR/RXR together had an additive effect on the activation of αB-promoter in the transfected lens cells. Thus, the αB-crystallin gene is activated by Pax-6 and retinoic acid receptors, making these transcription factors examples of proteins that have critical roles in early development as well as in the expression of proteins characterizing terminal differentiation.

The refractive properties of the transparent eye lens depend on a diverse group of globular proteins called crystallins that comprise approximately 90% of the water-soluble proteins of this tissue (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 2Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Prog. Nucl. Acid Mol. Biol. 1991; 41: 259-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Despite their specialized function in the lens, crystallins are surprisingly diverse and may differ among species. Moreover, crystallins often play more than one biological role, a situation called gene sharing (3Piatigorsky J. O'Brien W.E. Norman B.L. Kalumuck K. Wistow G.J. Borras T. Nickerson J.M.

These multifunctional crystallins are expressed very highly in the lens and to a lesser extent in other tissues, where they have nonrefractive roles. The molecular basis for the specialized expression of crystallin genes has been investigated for some time (7Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). While no onecis-control element or transcription factor is solely responsible for the high lens expression of the crystallin genes, Pax-6 (8Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Bresnick E.M. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell.

Evol. 1993; 10: 103-126PubMed Google Scholar) that is constitutively expressed highly in the lens and more moderately in many other tissues (31Bhat S.P. Nagineni C.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 158: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 32Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin is also induced by stress (33Klemenz R. Frohli E. Aoyama A. Hoffman S. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Schafer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 803-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and overexpressed in numerous diseases (34Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K. Goldman J.E.

The differential constitutive expression of the murine αB-crystallin gene is developmentally and transcriptionally controlled (32Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell.

Transgenic mouse experiments have established that the sequences downstream of −164 are sufficient to direct lens-specific gene expression (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This 5′-flanking sequence contains two lens-specific regulatory regions called LSR1 (−147/−118) and LSR2 (−78/−46). Pax-6 can interact with both LSR1 and LSR2 and activate the αB-crystallin promoter in transient transfection experiments (39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show by DNase I footprinting, antibody/electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), site-directed mutagenesis, and transient-cotransfection experiments that RAR/RXR heterodimers can interact at retinoic acid-responsive elements (RAREs) within LSR1 and LSR2 and can activate the αB-crystallin promoter in lens cells either alone or collaboratively with Pax-6. For transfection experiments, plasmid DNA was isolated and purified using the Qiagen plasmid kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Total RNA was isolated from N/N1003A cells (40Reddan J.R. Chepelinsky A.B. Dziedzic D.C. Piatigorsky J. Goldenberg E.M. Differentiation. 1986; 33: 168-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) treated with RA (Sigma) by using the RNA Isolation Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and subsequently fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel. The RNA was transferred to a Duralon membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and hybridized to a 230-base pair HindIII–BamHI restriction fragment from exon 3 of the mouse αB-crystallin gene (32Dubin R.A. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The probe was labeled by using the Ready-To-Go Random Prime Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prehybridizations were performed at 60 °C for 30 min, and hybridizations were carried out at 60 °C for 90 min by using QuickHyb (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were washed and autoradiographed as described previously (41Gopal-Srivastava R. Haynes J.I., II Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Methylene blue staining was performed as earlier (42Duncan M.K. DiCicco-Bloom E.M. Xiang X. Benezra R. Chada K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to monitor the integrity of RNA, the relative amounts of RNA loaded on the gel, and the efficiency of transfer to Duralon membranes. Membranes were exposed for autoradiography on Kodak XAR5 film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen for 12 h. Nuclear extracts (9Cvekl A. Kashanchi F. Sax C.M. Brady J.N. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 653-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared from αTN4–1 (43Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 9: 31-37Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and N/N1003A lens cells. Complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized (model 380A synthesizer; Applied Biosystems) and annealed at a 1:1 molar ratio as described previously (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligodeoxynucleotides were labeled on one strand using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as described previously (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides LSR1, LSR2, and short LSR2 containing sequences −136 to −109, −78 to −28, and −73 to −48, respectively, of the αB-crystallin promoter were used for EMSAs. Anti-mouse RAR/RXR monoclonal antibodies (45Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Pfister V. Heyberger S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Drs. Pierre Chambon and Maria Gaub (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Strasbourg, France). Polyclonal antibodies were bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (anti-RXRβ, catalog number sc 831; anti-RARα, catalog number sc 551; anti-RARβ, catalog number sc 552; anti-RARγ, catalog number sc 773; and anti-RXRα, catalog number sc 774). A polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment corresponding to the −190 to +40 sequence of the αB-crystallin gene was used for footprinting experiments with purified mouse RAR/RXR receptors. DNA and protein were incubated and treated with DNase I as described previously (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RAR/RXR proteins were kindly provided by Drs. Keiko Ozato and Jorge Blanco (NICHD, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). RARγ was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. End-labeling, EMSA, and DNase I footprinting were performed as described earlier (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts prepared from αTN4–1 and N/N1003A lens cells were fractionated by electrophoresis in a Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel; the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans-Blot (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Plasmids containing mutations generated previously (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) within the −164/+44EcoRI/PstI fragment of the mouse αB-crystallin gene, cloned in pRD30A (36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 9: 4340-4349Crossref Google Scholar), were used for transient transfection experiments and EMSAs. In brief, site-specific mutations (Mu-9762 and Mu-9763) (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were introduced by using an oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit (Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mutated oligodeoxynucleotides contained the substitution sequence TCTAGA (XbaI site) and 20 bases on each side complementary to the αB-crystallin promoter sequence. The resulting mutated restriction fragments were subcloned into pRD30A at the unique BamHI site (36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 9: 4340-4349Crossref Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the ligated junctions and mutated regions. Mouse COP-8 fibroblasts (46Tyndall C. La Mantia G. Thacker C.M. Favaloro J. Kamen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6231-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and N/N1003A lens cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin in 10% CO2. The cells were propagated on 60-mm diameter plastic dishes. 10 μg of wild-type αB-promoter-cat plasmids (p65–7 and p11–3) (36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 9: 4340-4349Crossref Google Scholar) or mutated test plasmids (Mu-9762 and Mu-9763) (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); increasing amounts (0.25–1 μg) of pSV40RARβ and pRSVRXRβ (gifts from Drs. Keiko Ozato and Jorge Blanco), which express the wild-type RARβ and RXRβ, respectively (47Minucci S. Zand D.J. Dey A. Marks M.S. Nagata T. Grippo J.F. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 2 μg of internal control pCH110, which expresses β-galactosidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), were cotransfected for 6 h by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 100 μl of 0.1 ng/ml of RA in the morning following transfection for 1 h. The cells were harvested, and extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. CAT activities were determined by the biphasic assay (48Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar), and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (44Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection data represent the means of three separate experiments, with each experiment being conducted in duplicate. In order to test whether retinoid signaling can induce endogenous αB-crystallin gene expression in lens cells, Northern blot hybridizations were performed with total RNA isolated from N/N1003A cells treated with increasing concentrations of RA (Fig. 1). The intensity of hybridization of the labeled probe to αB-crystallin mRNA was approximately 3 times greater in the cells treated with higher concentrations of RA (Fig. 1,lanes 1–3). Control tests showed no increase in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and α-actin mRNAs after treatment with RA (data not shown). Nuclear extracts from N/N1003A and αTN4–1 lens cells were used to test for the presence of RAR/RXR receptors. Western blot analysis using anti-RAR and anti-RXR antibodies showed that both αTN4–1 and N/N1003A cells express RAR (Fig. 2 A,lanes 3 and 4) and RXR receptors (Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 4), consistent with the induction of αB-crystallin gene expression by RA. Purified RARβ (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) and RXRβ (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) were used as positive controls in these tests. We next examined the possibility that heterodimers of retinoic acid receptors can bind to the lens-specific sites LSR1 and LSR2. Three retinoic acid receptor heterodimers (RARβ/RARγ, RXRβ/RARγ, and RARβ/RXRβ) were tested for the ability to protect the −190/+40 fragment of the αB-crystallin gene from digestion with DNase. Fig. 3 shows that three regions were protected by each of the heterodimers tested, with the weakest footprint generated by RXRβ/RARγ. The protected regions comprised LSR1 (−132/−110), LSR2 (−73/−54), and a region between LSR1 and LSR2 (−106/−87). The LSR1 and LSR2 sequence was footprinted on both DNA strands; however, the intervening region (−106/−87) was not footprinted on the upper (sense) strand (data not shown). The footprinted sequences and the surrounding nucleotides are shown in Fig. 4 A. Regions that resemble the consensus binding sequence for RAR/RXR (12Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L-C. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) are designated RARE in Fig. 4 B; the nucleotides represented by thelarger uppercase letters conform with the RAR/RXR consensus binding sequence, while the nucleotides represented by the smaller letters deviate from the consensus binding sequence. In general, the DNase I-footprinted sequences in both LSR1 and LSR2 match quite well with the RAR/RXR consensus binding sequence. Next we examined the binding of nuclear proteins derived from the N/N1003A lens cells to the LSR1 and LSR2 regions of the αB-crystallin promoter. Incubation of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide LSR2 (−78/−28) with the N/N1003A nuclear extract resulted in the formation of three major complexes (Fig. 5 A, lane 2, C1–3). These complexes were abolished by competition with self-oligodeoxynucleotide LSR2 (Fig. 5 A,lane 3) and diminished with a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing LSR1 (Fig. 5 A,lane 4). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides RARE and RARβ, which both contain the consensus RARE site, competed for the formation of complexes 1 and 3 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 5 and 6, respectively). By contrast, double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide 9718/9719, which contains the chicken αA-crystallin Pax-6 binding site, and double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide 926/927, which contains a consensus binding sequence for Pax-6, competed for the formation of complex 2 but not complexes 1 and 3 (Fig. 5 A,lanes 7 and 8, respectively). Although we cannot be certain, we believe that the two complexes migrating faster than complex 3 are nonspecific, since they were not significantly affected by competition with oligodeoxynucleotides containing consensus RARE and Pax-6 binding sites. Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide LSR1 (−136/−109) also formed two shifted complexes when incubated with nuclear extracts derived from N/N1003A (Fig. 5 B, lane 2) and αTN4–1 (Fig. 5 B, lane 3) lens cells. Oligodeoxynucleotides containing the consensus RARE sequence or the LSR1 sequence competed efficiently for the formation of these complexes (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and6, respectively). The LSR2 oligodeoxynucleotide competed weakly for formation of the LSR1 complexes (Fig. 5 B,lane 4). In order to investigate the possibility that the lens nuclear proteins that bind to the lens-specific regions of the αB-crystallin promoter have antigenic similarity to RAR/RXR receptors, EMSAs were performed using double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides containing LSR2 sequences (−78/−28) and purified RARβ/RXRβ heterodimers. A gel shift complex indicated by C was formed (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and 11) that was supershifted (indicated byS) by monoclonal antibodies to RXRβ (Fig. 6 A,lane 3) or RXR(α,β,γ) (Fig. 6 A, lane 6) and by polyclonal antibodies to RARα, -β, and -γ (RAR(α,β,γ)) (Fig. 6 A, lane 8) or RXRβ (Fig. 6 A, lane 10). Neither monoclonal antibodies to RXRα (Fig. 6 A, lane 4) and RXRγ (Fig. 6 A, lane 5) nor a polyclonal antibody to RXRα (Fig. 6 A, lane 9) supershifted the RARβ/RXRβ complex with the LSR2 oligodeoxynucleotide. A major gel shift complex was also formed with a shorter double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing the LSR2 sequence (−73/−48) and αTN4–1 lens cell nuclear extract (Fig. 6 B, lane 5). This complex was diminished by treatment with a monoclonal antibody to RXRγ (Fig. 6 B, lane 3) and was essentially abolished with monoclonal antibodies to RXR(α,β,γ) (Fig. 6 B, lane 1) or RXRα alone (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). The RAR antibodies used in Fig. 6 A did not diminish the complexes formed using the αTN4–1 nuclear extract (data not shown). Taken together, these data show that RARβ/RXRβ heterodimers bind to the αB-crystallin promoter via LSR1 and LSR2 and suggest that similar binding occurs in lens cell nuclei. However, these data do not indicate which of the multiple RARs and RXRs bind to LSR2 in the lens cell nuclear extracts. To test whether RARβ/RXRβ receptors can activate the αB-crystallin promoter, transient cotransfection experiments were performed using cDNA expression plasmids in N/N1003A lens cells. Vector alone (pRSV) did not activate the −164/+44 αB-crystallin promoter fused to the cat gene (p65–7) in cotransfected N/N1003A cells (data not shown). p65–7 contains LSR1 and LSR2. By contrast, cotransfection with a mixture of pSV40RARβ and pRSVRXRβ caused a 5–6-fold RA-dependent stimulation of CAT activity in the cells transfected with p65–7 (Fig. 7 A). Cotransfection with either pSV40RARβ or pRSVRXRβ alone, however, did not stimulate the reporter gene expression to a significant level (data not shown). pSV40RARβ and pRSVRXRβ stimulated CAT expression approximately 3-fold in cotransfection experiments using p11–3, which contains LSR2 but lacks LSR1 (Fig. 7 A). The absolute amount of CAT activity produced from p11–3 was at least 3-fold lower than that resulting from p65–7 (data not shown). Site-specific mutations Mu-9762 and Mu-9763 that were generated previously in the −147/−118 sequence (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of LSR1 were used to verify that RARβ/RXRβ stimulates αB-promoter activity through LSR1. Thus, the mutated promoter constructs (Mu-9760 and Mu-9761) were compared with the wild-type construct (p65–7) for their ability to direct expression of thecat gene in N/N1003A cells cotransfected with pSV40RARβ and pRSVRXRβ. The αB-crystallin promoters containing the Mu-9762 and Mu-9763 mutations were only about half as responsive as the wild type promoter in p65–7 to stimulation by pSV40RARβ and pRSVRXRβ in the cotransfected cells (Fig. 7 B). Finally, since both Pax-6 (39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and RARβ/RXRβ (above) can stimulate αB-crystallin promoter activity, we tested whether these transcription factors have an additive or synergistic effect in cotransfection experiments. First, we confirmed that the Pax-6 expression plasmid, pKW10-Pax-6 (49Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), can stimulate CAT expression in N/N1003A lens cells transfected with p65–7, since our earlier experiments showing a maximum 5-fold increase in αB-crystallin promoter activity were performed in the COP-8 fibroblast cell line (39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 8 A show that pKW10-Pax-6 has a similar effect on p65–7 activity in the cotransfected N/N1003A cells as previously in COP-8 cells, even with respect to the decrease at higher concentrations of pKW10-Pax-6. Similar results were obtained with pKW10-Pax-6 and p11–3, which contains only LSR2 (data not shown). Cotransfection experiments using pKW10-Pax-6, pSV40RARβ, and pRSVRXRβ in conjunction with p11–3 (Fig. 8 B) or p65–7 (Fig. 8 C) showed that Pax-6 and RARβ/RXRβ have an additive stimulatory effect on αB-crystallin promoter activity. The additive stimulation was approximately twice as great with p65–7 as with p11–3. These data suggest that LSR1 and LSR2 are regulatory regions that utilize both Pax-6 and RAR/RXR for αB-crystallin promoter activity. We have shown previously in transgenic mice using reporter transgenes that the high lens and lower nonlens expression of the mouse αB-crystallin gene are developmentally controlled at the transcriptional level (36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 9: 4340-4349Crossref Google Scholar, 37Haynes J.I., II Duncan M.K. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Lens-specific expression has been localized to LSR1 (−147/−118) and LSR2 (−78/−46), with the minimal lens-specific αB-crystallin promoter fragment identified being the −115/+44 sequence (38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The combined presence of LSR1 and LSR2 in the −164/+44 promoter fragment is approximately 30 times more active in the lens than is LSR2 alone in the minimal promoter fragment in transgenic mice (39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Promoter activity is augmented approximately 7-fold in the transgenic mouse lens when the −426/+44 promoter fragment is used, which includes an enhancer at positions −426/−259 (36Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 9: 4340-4349Crossref Google Scholar, 38Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, high lens activity of the mouse αB-crystallin gene depends on coupling multiple cis-control elements and their cognate transcription factors. We have shown earlier and confirm here that Pax-6 can activate the αB-crystallin promoter via both LSR1 and LSR2 in transient transfection experiments (39Gopal-Srivastava R. Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23029-23036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pax-6 also contributes to the lens expression of the mouse (9Cvekl A. Kashanchi F. Sax C.M. Brady J.N. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 653-660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and chicken (8Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Bresnick E.M. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7363-7376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) αA-, the chicken δ1- (10Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Li X. McDermott J.B. Piatigorsky J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4681-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the guinea pig ζ- (11Richardson J. Cvekl A. Wistow G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4676-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) crystallin genes (7Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In recent transgenic mouse experiments, a mutant TATA-like sequence associated with LSR2 preferentially reduced αB-crystallin promoter activity in the lens in a Pax-6-independent fashion, indicating that, as expected, multiple factors contribute to the specialized activity of the αB-crystallin promoter in the lens (50Haynes J.I., II Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The present investigation shows that retinoic acid receptors, especially RARβ/RXRβ heterodimers, can also bind LSR1 and LSR2 and activate the αB-crystallin promoter. The activation of the αB-crystallin promoter by the simultaneous presence of RARβ/RXRβ and Pax-6 is additive rather than synergistic and leaves unresolved whether or not these factors physically interact with each other or through co-factors. Indeed, the mechanism of gene activation by retinoid receptors has not been established and involves chromatin alterations as well as direct interactions with DNA sequences (51Minucci S. Wong J. Blanco J.C.G. Shi Y-B. Wolffe A.P. Ozato K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if retinoic acid receptors play a role in the nonlens or stress-induction of the αB-crystallin/small heat shock protein (35Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). Retinoic acid receptors are members of the superfamily of nuclear factors (thryroid hormone, steroid hormone, and vitamin D3 receptors) and are involved in a wide array of developmental processes (52Morriss-Kay G. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 53Giguere V. Tini M. Flock G. Ong E. Evans R.M. Otulakowski G.

The importance of retinoid signaling for eye development in mice has been established by application of exogenous RA (57Hyatt G.A. Schmitt E.A. Marsh-Armstrong N.A. McCafferey P. Drager U.C. Dowling J.E. Development. 1996; 122: 195-204PubMed Google Scholar) and by deleting various combinations of RAR and RXR genes (18Lohnes D. Mark M. Mendelsohn C. Dolle P. Dierich A. Gorry P. Gansmuller A. Chambon P. Development. 1994; 120: 2723-2748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kastner P. Grondona J.M. Mark M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Decimo D. Dolle P. Chambon P.

The existence of retinoic acid receptors in cultured lens cells was shown in our Western blots in the present experiments. A role of retinoid signaling for lens differentiation is implied by the generation of abnormal lens phenotypes by ectopic expression of cellular RA-binding protein 1 (15Perez-Castro A.V. Tran V.T. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Development. 1993; 119: 363-375PubMed Google Scholar) and RAR (60Balkan W. Klintworth G.K. Bock C.B. Linney E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and by the expression of reporter genes driven by RAREs of the RARβ gene in the presumptive (61Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado M. Shago M. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and developing (20Balkan W. Colbert M. Block C. Linney E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3347-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) lens of transgenic mice. It has also been demonstrated that a minimal promoter-lacZ reporter gene fused to the RARE from the human RARβ-2 gene is expressed in the zebrafish as early as embryonic day 9.5 in specific embryonic regions including the optic cup (62Hyatt G.A. Dowling J.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 1471-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, retinoic acid receptors and Pax-6 are both examples of general factors that play essential roles in the early development of the lens as well as in the regulated expression of crystallin genes, which encode the major proteins of the terminally differentiated lens (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 479-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the idea that one of the selective mechanisms used for recruiting the multifunctional crystallins is their responsiveness to transcription factors required for the development and maintenance of the transparent lens (5de Jong W.W. Hendriks W. Mulders J.W.M. Bloemendal H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 365-368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4277-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 63Piatigorsky J. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 196: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). So far our data show only that RXRβ and at least one of the RARs (α, β, or γ) are present in the N/N1003A and αTN4–1 lens cells. With respect to the intact lens, a broad complex forms with the LSR2 oligodeoxynucleotide and lens nuclear extract; however, this complex was unaffected by the addition of the set of RAR and RXR antibodies used in the experiments with the cultured cells (data not shown). Because of the overlap between the Pax-6 and RAR/RXR binding sites, it is possible that Pax-6, RAR/RXR, and other factors present in the lens nuclei bind simultaneously at LSR2 and leave the antibody-interactive sites for the retinoic acid receptors unavailable. In any case, further experiments are necessary to establish unequivocally which retinoic acid receptors may be involved in the activation of the αB-crystallin gene in the cultured lens cells and in the intact lens. The present results add to previous experiments indicating that RA and its receptors play a critical role in the regulation of crystallin genes in the lens. RA has been shown to activate the δ1-crystallin gene in stably transformed mouse teratocarcinoma stem cells (64Goto K. Hayashi S. Takeichi M. Kondoh H. Cell Differ. 1988; 24: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and in cultured lens epithelial cells from newly hatched chickens (17Patek C.E. Clayton R.M. Exp. Eye Res. 1990; 50: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recent cotransfection experiments using reporter genes in recombinant plasmids have provided more direct evidence implicating retinoic acid receptors in the control of the chicken δ1-crystallin gene (14Li X. Cvekl A. Bassnett S. Piatigorsky J. Dev. Genet. 1997; 20: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Unlike the δ1-crystallin promoter/enhancer, the δ2-crystallin promoter/enhancer is not stimulated by RARβ in the cotransfected primary lens epithelial cells. This differential responsiveness is particularly interesting, since δ2-crystallin, an active argininosuccinate lysase, is present at a relatively low concentration in the chicken lens, while enzymatically inactive δ1-crystallin is the major δ-crystallin in the lens (3Piatigorsky J. O'Brien W.E. Norman B.L. Kalumuck K. Wistow G.J. Borras T. Nickerson J.M. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3479-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 65Kondoh H. Araki I. Yasuda K. Matsubasa T. Mori M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1991; 99: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the mouse γF-crystallin gene is controlled by retinoid signaling. It was first shown that RAR/RXR heterodimers bind to a novel everted RARE (called γF-HRE) consisting of two half-sites separated by eight base pairs in the 5′-flanking sequence (66Tini M. Fraser R.A. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The regulation of the γF-crystallin gene by retinoic acid receptors appears very complex, inasmuch as γF-HRE is activated by T3R/RXR as well as RAR/RXR, yet is repressed by T3R/RARα (13Tini M. Tsui L-C. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1494-1506PubMed Google Scholar). There is also an RAR-related orphan receptor, RORα1, that is expressed in the mouse lens and binds as a monomer to the γF-HRE 3′-half site and spacer sequences (66Tini M. Fraser R.A. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RORα1 stimulates γF-crystallin promoter activity in transfected primary chicken lens epithelial cells. Moreover, RORα1 occupancy and promoter activation are blocked by competing RAR/RXR heterodimers in the absence of RA; the blockage of RORα1 activation of γF-HRE by RARα is dose-dependent and similar to the repression of the T3 response from γF-HRE reporter plasmids. The novelty of γF-HRE (12Tini M. Otulakowski G. Breitman M.L. Tsui L-C. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the involvement of RORα1, which does not compete for binding to β-RARE or TRE (66Tini M. Fraser R.A. Giguere V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), raises the possibility that the stimulation of the γF- and αB-crystallin promoters operates by different pathways. Many invertebrates have complex eyes with cellular lenses containing abundant crystallins (67Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Virtually nothing is known about the developmental pathways controlling the development of these lens-containing invertebrate eyes or about the regulatory mechanisms used for expressing their crystallin genes. Recent experiments have raised the possibility that retinoid signaling may extend to crystallin gene expression in invertebrates. Two novel lens crystallin genes (J1A- and J1B-crystallin) cloned from the cubomedusan jellyfish (Tripedalia cystophora) (68Piatigorsky J. Horwitz J. Norman B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11894-11901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have RARE half-sites in their promoter regions, and these sequences bind a cloned RXR homologue derived from the same species. 2Z. Kostrouch, M. Kostrouchova, W. Lowe, E. Jannini, J. Piatigorsky, and J. E. Rall, manuscript in preparation. If a causal connection can be made between retinoic acid receptors and J-crystallin gene expression, it would provide strong evidence that retinoid signaling is a conserved pathway for crystallin gene expression throughout the animal kingdom.

Despite the importance of this enzyme to the survival of prokaryotic cells and to the treatment of bacterial infections, relatively little is known about the details of its catalytic mechanism or the basis by which quinolones alter its enzymatic functions. Therefore, a series of experiments that analyzed individual steps of the topoisomerase IV catalytic cycle were undertaken to address these critical mechanistic issues. The following conclusions were drawn. First, equilibrium levels of DNA cleavage mediated by the bacterial enzyme were considerably (>10-fold) higher than those observed with its eukaryotic counterparts. To a large extent, this reflected decreased rates of DNA religation. Second, the preference of topoisomerase IV for catalyzing DNA decatenation over relaxation reflects increased rates of strand passage and enzyme recycling rather than a heightened recognition of intermolecular DNA helices. Third, quinolones stimulate topoisomerase IV-mediated DNA cleavage both by increasing rates of DNA scission and by inhibiting religation of cleaved DNA. Finally, quinolones inhibit the overall catalytic activity of topoisomerase IV primarily by interfering with enzyme-ATP interactions.

Type II topoisomerases alter the topological state of the genetic material by passing an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment (1Osheroff N.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2070) Google Scholar). The most well characterized of the two, DNA gyrase, was discovered over 2 decades ago (7Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). It is unique among type II enzymes in that it is the only known topoisomerase (prokaryotic or eukaryotic) that is capable of introducing negative superhelical twists into relaxed DNA molecules (7Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3872-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). DNA gyrase plays critical roles in DNA replication, recombination, and transcription, as well as in the maintenance of genomic superhelical density (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 5Menzel R.

The second prokaryotic type II enzyme, topoisomerase IV, is comprised of the products of the parC and parE genes (10Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Although it was long known that ParC and ParE both were required for proper chromosome segregation in Escherichia coli (11Hirota Y. Ryter A. Jacob F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 677-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 12Kato J.-I. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3967-3977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was not realized until 1990 that these two polypeptides together constitute a novel type II topoisomerase (10Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Consistent with its critical role in chromosome segregation, topoisomerase IV displays a prejudice for catalyzing intermolecular DNA strand passage events (i.e. catenation/decatenation reactions) as opposed to intramolecular events (i.e. DNA relaxation reactions) (13Adams D.E.

This prejudice notwithstanding, topoisomerase IV appears to relax DNA in vivo, and recent evidence suggests that this relaxation activity plays an important role in maintaining levels of DNA supercoiling in E. coli (17Zechiedrich E.L. Khodursky A.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2580-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Beyond their essential physiological functions, prokaryotic type II topoisomerases are the cytotoxic targets for quinolone-based antimicrobial agents (18Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T.

Rev. 1996; 16: 433-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 26Hooper D.C. Wolfson J.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 324: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 27). Quinolones act in a pernicious fashion. First, they dramatically increase levels of covalent enzyme-cleaved DNA complexes that are requisite but transitory intermediates in the catalytic double-stranded DNA passage reaction of type II enzymes (2Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 8Kreuzer K.N. Cozzarelli N.R. J.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 377-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). As a result of this action, quinolones “poison” prokaryotic type II topoisomerases and convert them to potent cellular toxins that create double-stranded breaks in the genome of treated cells (2Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 22Maxwell A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1992; 30: 409-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27). Second, quinolones also inhibit the overall catalytic activity of the type II enzymes (20Kato J. Suzuki H. Ikeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25676-25684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,28Hoshino K.

In so doing, they further damage bacterial cells by depriving them of the critical functions performed by these ubiquitous enzymes. Despite the importance of topoisomerase IV to the survival of prokaryotic cells and to the treatment of bacterial infections, relatively little is known about the details of its catalytic mechanism. Furthermore, the basis by which quinolones stimulate DNA cleavage or inhibit the overall catalytic activity of any bacterial type II topoisomerase remains an enigma. Therefore, a series of experiments that analyzed individual steps of the topoisomerase IV catalytic cycle was undertaken to address these critical mechanistic issues. Results provide insight into the underlying basis for the high levels of DNA cleavage generated by topoisomerase IV and the preference of the enzyme for intermolecular DNA substrates. In addition, they provide a framework for interpreting the actions of quinolones against prokaryotic type II topoisomerases. Topoisomerase IV was purified from E. coli by the procedure of Peng and Marians (21Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human topoisomerase IIα was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (30Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by the protocol of Kingma et al. (31Kingma P.S. Greider C.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5934-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Drosophila melanogaster topoisomerase II was isolated from embryonic Kc cells as described by Shelton et al. (32Shelton E.R. Osheroff N. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9530-9535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ciprofloxacin was obtained from Sigma, and all other quinolones were synthesized at Pfizer Central Research by the procedure of Gilligan et al. (33Gilligan P.J. McGuirk P.R. Witty M.J. U. S. Patent 4. 1986: 623-650Google Scholar). Quinolones were stored as 40 mm stock solutions in 0.1 n NaOH and then diluted to 8 mm with Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, immediately prior to use. Tris, ethidium bromide, and APP(NH)P 1The abbreviations used are: APP(NH)P, adenyl-5′-yl β,γ-imidodiphosphate; DTT, dithiothreitol; kDNA, kinetoplast DNA. were obtained from Sigma; SDS and proteinase K were from Merck; ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; histone H1 was from Boehringer Mannheim; and [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were analytical reagent grade. Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was isolated from E. coli as described previously (34Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). Catenated pBR322 was prepared by incubating 5 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 monomers with 100 nm Drosophila topoisomerase II, 1 mm ATP, and 15 μg/ml histone H1 in 500 μl of topo II assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmMgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol) at 30 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 75 μl of stop solution (0.77% SDS, 77 mm EDTA), and the type II enzyme was digested with proteinase K (final concentration 80 μg/ml) at 45 °C for 30 min. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in 15 μl of water. As monitored by electrophoresis in agarose gels, ≥95% of the DNA product was catenated. Catenated DNA (kDNA) was isolated from the kinetoplasts ofCrithidia fasciculata as described (35Englund P.T. Cell. 1978; 14: 157-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Monomeric (i.e. decatenated) kDNA was prepared by incubating 5 nm kDNA with 2 nm topoisomerase IV, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm DTT in 500 μl of topo IV assay buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 80 mmpotassium glutamate, 8 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol) at 37 °C for 60 min. Reactions were stopped, and DNA samples were isolated as described above. As monitored by electrophoresis in agarose gels, ≥95% of the DNA product was monomeric. DNA cleavage assays in the absence or presence of quinolones were performed as described by Corbett et al. (36Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, to monitor levels of pre-strand passage DNA cleavage, 5 nm negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA was incubated with 7.5 nm topoisomerase IV and 10 mm DTT in 20 μl of topo IV cleavage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mm MgCl2, and 2.5% glycerol) at 37 °C for 8 min. Alternatively, assays contained either 75 nm Drosophila topoisomerase II (in topo II assay buffer) or 150 nm human topoisomerase IIα (in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol) and were incubated at 30 °C for 6 min or 37 °C for 10 min, respectively. Assays that monitored post-strand passage DNA cleavage also contained 1 mmAPP(NH)P. In all cases, DNA cleavage reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS (1% final concentration) followed by EDTA (15 mm final concentration). Samples were digested with proteinase K as described above. Following the addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (30% sucrose, 0.5% bromphenol blue, and 0.5% xylene cyanole FF in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), DNA products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in 40 mmTris acetate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. DNA bands were visualized by UV light, photographed through Kodak 23A and 12 filters with Polaroid type 665 film, and quantitated by scanning negatives with an E-C apparatus model EC910 densitometer in conjunction with Hoefer GS-370 Data System software. The intensity of bands in the negative was proportional to the amount of DNA present. Double-stranded DNA breaks were monitored by the conversion of negatively supercoiled plasmid to linear molecules. Reactions were carried out by the procedure of Robinson and Osheroff (37Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). DNA cleavage/religation equilibria were established as described in the preceding section in the presence or absence of 20 μm ciprofloxacin. Pre- or post-strand passage DNA religation assays were carried out in the absence of a nucleoside triphosphate or in the presence of 1 mmAPP(NH)P, respectively. Religation was initiated by shifting the temperature from 37 to 75 °C and stopped at various times up to 150 s by the addition of SDS (1% final concentration). Samples were processed and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described in the preceding section. The apparent first order rate of religation was determined by quantifying the loss of linear DNA. Reactions were performed at 37 °C as described by Corbett et al. (36Corbett A.H. Zechiedrich E.L. Lloyd R.S. Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 20 μl of topo IV assay buffer in the presence of 7.5 nm topoisomerase IV, 50 nm DNA (either catenated or monomeric pBR322 plasmid, or catenated or monomeric kDNA), 1 mm ATP, ∼10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm DTT, and 0 to 20 μm ciprofloxacin. Samples (3 μl) were removed at various times up to 10 min and spotted onto thin layer cellulose plates impregnated with polyethyleneimine (J. T. Baker Inc.). Following chromatography in freshly made 400 mmNH4HCO3, levels of ATP hydrolysis were monitored by quantifying the release of inorganic phosphate using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Assays contained 5 nmkDNA, 2 nm topoisomerase IV, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm DTT, and 0 to 50 μm ciprofloxacin and were incubated in 20 μl of topo IV assay buffer at 37 °C for 15 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μl of stop solution and digested with proteinase K as above. DNA products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in 100 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm EDTA, stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and visualized as described above. The percent decatenation was quantified by determining the appearance of monomeric circular DNA molecules. The double-stranded DNA cleavage/religation cycle is central to the catalytic functions of all type II topoisomerases (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 4Watt P.M.

BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). During the cleavage step of this cycle, these enzymes form a covalent intermediate with the newly created 5′-DNA termini generated by scission (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Reece R.J. Maxwell A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 4Watt P.M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4412-4416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium established by type II topoisomerases can be monitored by quantitating levels of this covalent cleavage complex (39Sander M. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8421-8428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Liu L.F. Rowe T.C. Yang L. Tewey K.M. Chen G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15365-15370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During their catalytic cycles, type II topoisomerases undergo two separate DNA cleavage/religation reactions (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 681-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 37Robinson M.J.

The first of the two occurs prior to (and is requisite for) the DNA strand passage reaction step. This “pre-strand passage” reaction can be examined by monitoring DNA cleavage/religation in the absence of ATP (binding of which triggers strand passage) (43Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The second reaction occurs subsequent to the DNA strand passage event. This “post-strand passage” reaction can be examined by monitoring DNA cleavage/religation in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog such as APP(NH)P, which triggers strand passage but does not allow enzyme recycling (42Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Osheroff N. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9536-9543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reflecting the fact that type II topoisomerases need to religate cleaved DNA substrates in order to complete their catalytic cycles, the DNA cleavage/religation equilibria of these enzymes generally lie heavily toward religation (1Osheroff N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1989; 41: 223-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 38Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 44Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4303-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Levels of DNA cleavage tend to increase somewhat (∼2–4-fold) following strand passage, due primarily to a decrease in the apparent first order rate of post-strand passage DNA religation (at least for the eukaryotic type II enzymes) (37Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the DNA cleavage/religation reactions of topoisomerase IV are essential to its physiological functions, relatively little is known about these enzyme-mediated events. Therefore, three approaches were utilized to describe further these critical reaction steps. In the first, equilibrium levels of pre-strand passage DNA scission generated by E. coli topoisomerase IV were determined. In the absence of ATP, the predominance of religation was far less pronounced for topoisomerase IV than it was for previously characterized type II enzymes. As seen in Fig. 1, equilibrium levels of DNA scission for the bacterial enzyme were dramatically higher (∼200- and ∼40-fold, respectively) than those observed for two other non-gyrase type II topoisomerases, human topoisomerase IIα and Drosophila topoisomerase II. In fact, at equilibrium, ∼8% of topoisomerase IV appears to be in a covalent DNA cleavage complex as compared with significantly less than 1% for other type II enzymes examined. In the second approach, equilibrium levels of post-strand passage DNA cleavage were determined. As seen in Fig. 2, levels of scission were (for the most part) equal to or less than those observed in the absence of a nucleoside triphosphate when either APP(NH)P or ATP (which yields an average of pre- and post-strand passage equilibria) were included in reactions. This result is in marked contrast to previous findings with other non-gyrase type II topoisomerases (37Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 42Osheroff N. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9944-9950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last approach, DNA religation reactions mediated by topoisomerase IV were characterized. As seen in Fig. 3, prior to DNA strand passage, the apparent first order rate of religation mediated by topoisomerase IV was nearly an order of magnitude slower than that previously reported for Drosophila topoisomerase II (0.028 s−1 versus 0.248 s−1) (37Robinson M.J. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1807-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike the Drosophila enzyme, religation rates did not drop (and actually increased slightly) following strand passage. (Apparent first order rates of post-strand passage DNA religation were 0.035 s−1 and 0.095 s−1 for the E. coli and Drosophila enzymes, respectively.) Taken together, these results strongly suggest that differences in DNA cleavage/religation equilibria observed for topoisomerase IV and the eukaryotic type II topoisomerases are due (at least in part) to differences in DNA religation rates. Topoisomerase IV displays a pronounced preference for catalyzing in vitro strand passage reactions in which the two DNA helices are on separate molecules (i.e. decatenation as opposed to relaxation reactions) (13Adams D.E. Sheckhtman E.M. Zechiedrich E.L. Schmid M.B. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1992; 71: 277-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Peng H. Marians K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8571-8575Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Zechiedrich E.L. Cozzarelli N.R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 16Ullsperger C. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31549-31555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic basis that underlies this preference for intermolecular strand passage is unknown. The ability of topoisomerase IV to distinguish between inter- and intramolecular DNA substrates may be explained by two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) mechanisms. Either the enzyme preferentially recognizes and binds DNA molecules that contain intermolecular crossovers or it catalyzes higher rates of DNA strand passage with intermolecular substrates. Two experiments were carried out to distinguish between these possibilities. In the first, the ability of topoisomerase IV to recognize intermolecular substrates was assessed by a DNA cleavage assay. Topoisomerase IV displayed virtually no difference in its propensity to cleave negatively supercoiled monomeric (i.e.intramolecular substrate) or catenated (i.e. intermolecular substrate) pBR322 molecules (Fig. 4). If anything, levels of DNA scission were slightly decreased with catenated substrates. Since the efficiency of cleavage within a given DNA substrate reflects (to a large extent) levels of enzyme-DNA binding (45Zechiedrich E.L. Osheroff N. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4555-4562Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), this result indicates that the strong decatenation activity of topoisomerase IV is not due to a heightened recognition of substrates with intermolecular DNA helices. In the second experiment, the effects of inter- versusintramolecular DNA substrates on the ATPase activity of topoisomerase IV were assessed. ATP hydrolysis represents the penultimate step in the topoisomerase IV catalytic cycle and triggers enzyme recycling (3Corbett A.H. Osheroff N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1993; 6: 585-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 38Osheroff N. Zechiedrich E.L. Gale K.C. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was >4-fold higher in the presence of kDNA networks than it was with monomeric kDNA molecules. A more dramatic increase was observed when catenated pBR322 molecules were compared with monomeric pBR322 substrates. These data strongly suggest that the preferential decatenase activity of topoisomerase IV results from higher rates of strand passage and enzyme recycling with intermolecular substrates. Prokaryotic type II topoisomerases are the cytotoxic targets for a clinically important class of antibacterials known as quinolones (18Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. O'Dea M.H. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Proc.

The SDR 1The abbreviations used are: SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; RoDH, retinol dehydrogenase; CRAD,cis-retinol/androgen dehydrogenase; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; kb, kilobase(s); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; 17β-HSD6, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6. superfamily consists of ∼100 bacterial, plant, and animal enzymes ranging in size from ∼25 to 38 kDa that are related in terms of tertiary structure, including conserved cofactor-binding sites and catalytic residues (1Baker M.E.

But the members of the SDR superfamily have relatively few strictly conserved residues, and indeed, different members do not always share substantial amino acid identity. SDRs tend to have a multifunctional nature, i.e. they catalyze dehydrogenations/reductions of seemingly disparate substrates. In animals and bacteria, members of this superfamily catalyze the activation or inactivation of prostaglandins and many steroids. An apparent subgroup of the SDR superfamily, consisting of enzymes closely related to each other, catalyzes the metabolism of all-trans-retinol, cis-retinols, and androgens. This subfamily includes RoDH isozymes 1–3 and CRAD1 (4Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

Vertebrates require retinoid hormones, derived from the prohormone retinol (vitamin A), for vision, reproduction, embryogenesis, and maintenance of normal epithelial, bone, nerve, and immune system function (11Lotan R. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1988; 259: 261-271PubMed Google Scholar). The retinol metabolite all-trans-retinoic acid satisfies all known retinoid functions in retinol-deficient animals, except for light transduction during vision, because it cannot undergo reduction into the opsin cofactor retinal, and spermatogenesis, because it cannot cross the mammalian blood-testis barrier in low concentrations. All-trans-retinoic acid functions through the three ligand-dependent transcription factors known as RARα, RARβ, and RARγ (12Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 13Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar). An all-trans-retinoic acid isomer, 9-cis-retinoic acid, controls the in vitro activity of a distinct group of receptors known as RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ. RXRs affect the function of several receptors in the steroid/retinoid/thyroid/vitamin D superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors, including RARs, through heterodimerization. Because receptor function depends on ligand concentrations, pathways of all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis require understanding. A pathway of all-trans-retinol conversion first into all-trans-retinal and then into all-trans-retinoic acid has been established, but pathways of 9-cis-retinoic acid biosynthesis have not been determined (14Napoli J.L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 993-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). One problem with the latter has been identifying processes for enzymatically generating the putative hormone. Thus, enzymes that produce 9-cis-retinoids incur much interest. Androgens virilize males through supporting formation, growth, and maturation of reproductive organs and secondary sex characteristics (15Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 25-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Endocrine glands, including the testes, produce testosterone (4-androsten-17β-ol-3-one), whereas the irreversible steroid 5α-reductases of the prostate and other androgen target tissues produce the testosterone metabolite dihydrotestosterone (5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one) (16Wilson J.D. Gloyna R.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1970; 26: 309-336PubMed Google Scholar). Testosterone directs internal male genital formation; dihydrotestosterone directs embryonic external sex organ development and the phenotypic changes associated with male puberty (17Giffin J.E. McPhaul M.J. Russell D.W. Wilson J.D. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1995: 2967-2998Google Scholar). Both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone function through the androgen receptor. As with the other receptors mentioned above, androgen receptor function depends on ligand concentrations. Dihydrotestosterone undergoes inactivation via reduction into 3α-adiol (5α-androstan-3α,17β-diol), catalyzed by members of the aldo-keto reductase superfamily. Dehydrogenation of 3α-adiol by the SDR 17β-steroid dehydrogenase generates the impotent androgen, androsterone (5α-androstan-3α-ol-17-one), cleared as its glucuronide (18Beaulieu M. Lévesque E. Hum D.W. Bélanger A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22855-22862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Pathways that regenerate dihydrotestosterone from 3α-adiol occur in vivo and presumably contribute to regulating androgen receptor function (19Bruchovsky N. Endocrinology. 1971; 89: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Until recently, however, the specific enzymes responsible for regeneration of dihydrotestosterone were not known. The reports of 3α-adiol dehydrogenase activities of RoDH1 and CRAD1 provided candidates for such enzymatic activity (7Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Biswas M.G. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15959-15966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we report the isolation of a cDNA that encodes a heretofore unknown SDR, CRAD2. Many tissues express CRAD2 mRNA, but liver is the quantitatively major site of expression. CRAD2 shows 3α- and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities and catalyzes the dehydrogenation of retinols, including 9-cis-retinol. Expression of CRAD2 provides a means of altering the concentrations of active versus inactive androgens and of generating retinals from retinols. An 11-d.p.c. mouse embryonic λgt11 cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened through three rounds (final wash at 55 °C) with a32P-labeled probe consisting of RoDH1 nucleotides 298–673 (4Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3900-3904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). DNA inserts from six positive phages were digested withEcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II SK+/−. One of the six clones, pBSK/E6, was completely sequenced by nested deletion. Despite the use of a cDNA library, the 2.2-kb insert represented a genomic clone that included exon 1 of a gene in the SDR family. A 367-base pair probe containing 55 base pairs of 5′-end untranslated region and 312 base pairs of the coding region in exon 1 of E6 was generated by polymerase chain reaction with the primers 5′-TTACTCTCTGAAAACGGGGC (sense) and 5′-TCTGTTCCCAACACGCTC (antisense). A mouse liver λgt10 library (CLONTECH) was screened with a probe consisting of nucleotides 683–1080 of CRAD1 (7Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The positive plaques were then screened through two more rounds with the 367-base pair probe isolated from pBSK/E6. Phage DNA from three of five plaques isolated was digested with EcoRI. The inserts were ligated into pBluescript II SK+/− to produce pBSK/CRAD-39, pBSK/CRAD-188, and pBSK/CRAD-218 and sequenced in both directions by dideoxy chain termination. The coding region of an SDR was digested from λgt10 phage DNA containing the insert of pBSK/CRAD-218 with EcoRI and ligated into pcDNA3 to produce pcDNA3/CRAD2. CHO-K1 cells were cultured and transfected using LipofectAMINE with pcDNA3/CRAD2 or with pcDNA3 (mock) as described (7Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cell pellets were suspended in 10 mm HEPES and 10% sucrose, pH 7.5, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant protein was used for enzyme assays, unless noted otherwise. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Incubations and analysis of products have been described in detail (7Chai X. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33125-33131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, retinoid and steroid dehydrogenase assays were done at 37 °C in 0.25 ml of 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1.6 mm NAD+, pH 8, with the 800 ×g supernatant of mock- or pcDNA3/CRAD2-transfected CHO cells, unless noted otherwise. Retinoid dehydrogenase assays were quenched with 0.1 ml of 0.1 m O-ethylhydroxylamine and 0.35 ml of methanol, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and extracted with 2.5 ml of hexane. The retinoids in the hexane extract were quantified by normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, with a detection limit ∼1 pmol. 11-cis-Retinoids isomerize into more stable isomers during incubation and extraction; therefore, the sum of the retinal isomers recovered from incubating 11-cis-retinol was used to determine the rate of 11-cis-retinal synthesis (22Bushway R.J. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1985; 8: 1527-1547Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Steroid dehydrogenase assays were done with 3H-labeled steroids (40–101 Ci/mmol, 20,000 dpm/reaction). Reactions were extracted with methylene chloride (4 ml); the extracts were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. 3H-Labeled steroids were detected by autoradiography. The radioactive zones were excised and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. Kinetic data were obtained under initial velocity conditions and were fit with Enzfitter using simple weighing (23Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Non-linear Regression Data Analysis Program. Elsevier-Biosoft, Cambridge, United Kingdom1987Google Scholar). Northern blots were done with the mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), which provides 2 μg of poly(A+) RNA/lane on a nylon membrane. The probe was a chemically synthesized 75-base-long oligonucleotide of nucleotides 1–75 of CRAD2. The probe was labeled with 32P by random priming. Prehybridization was done in 10 ml of hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and 5× saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA) at 40 °C for 4 h. Hybridization was done overnight in the same solution containing 2 × 106 cpm of probe. The final wash was done at 55 °C with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Signals were visualized with a Bio-Rad GS-505 Molecular Imager system. A CRAD2-specific probe was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from pBSK/CRAD-39 with the sense primer 5′-GCTTCCATACTACTCAGA (nucleotides 1135–1152) and the antisense primer 5′-CAAGATTCTATCCCACCA (nucleotides 1463–1480). The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and linearized with SpeI. A 32P-labeled antisense probe was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Promega) for 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mm dithiothreitol; 0.5 mm each ATP, CTP, and GTP; and 50 μCi of UTP (800 Ci/mmol). The 308-nucleotide antisense β-actin mRNA probe (nucleotides 51–358) used as an internal standard was transcribed from pTRI mouse β-actin (Ambion Inc.) under the same conditions. DNA templates were removed by DNase I digestion. Transcripts were purified with 5% polyacrylamide and 8m urea gels. RNase protection assays were done with the HybspeedTM RPA kit (Ambion Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (50 μg) was extracted from mouse tissues with guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform and coprecipitated with cRNA probes (1 × 105 cpm for CRAD2 and 5 × 104 cpm for mouse β-actin) by 0.5m ammonium acetate and 70% ethanol. Pellets were resuspended in 10 μl of hybridization buffer (Ambion Inc.) by four alternating 15-s periods of vigorous vortexing and incubation at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were hybridized at 68 °C for 10 min. A 100-μl aliquot of RNase A/T1 mixture diluted 1:100 was allowed to digest the unhybridized probes and RNA for 30 min at 37 °C. Inactivation/precipitation mixture (150 μl) was added, and the samples were kept at −20 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were dissolved in 8 μl of gel loading buffer for denaturing gels by heating at 95 °C for 4 min. The samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide and 8m urea gels and run at ∼180 V for 2 h in 1× Tris borate/EDTA. Quantitative analysis was performed with a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager PC. A mouse embryonic cDNA library was screened with a probe that encoded amino acids 2–126 of RoDH1, i.e. sequence highly conserved among the three known RoDH isozymes and CRAD1 (4Chai X.

A partial genomic clone was isolated, most likely from contamination during preparation of the commercial cDNA library. Because we have isolated genomic clones for RoDH/CRAD, 2X. Chai and J. L. Napoli, unpublished results. it was recognized as exon 1 of an unknown SDR with high sequence similarity to CRAD1. To obtain the complete coding region of the novel cDNA, a mouse liver cDNA library was first screened with a probe from CRAD1; the positive plaques were rescreened with a probe generated by polymerase chain reaction from the exon of the novel SDR. Two of the three positive plaques identified included complete coding regions, and all three had identical deduced amino acid sequences in areas of overlap. The amino acid sequences, however, were distinct from those of RoDH isozymes 1–3 and CRAD1. The new SDR was named CRAD2 because its substrate specificity resembled that of CRAD1 (see below). The deduced amino acid sequence of CRAD2 contained 20 of the 23 amino acids conserved in ∼70% of SDRs, including the cofactor-binding residues G36(X)2SGXG, the L109 XNNAG sequence (unknown function), and the catalytic residues Y175(X)3K (Fig. 1). All three RoDH isozymes, CRAD1, and CRAD2 show high sequence conservation in their first 115 N-terminal amino acids. The largest difference occurs between CRAD2 and RoDH2, which differ in six amino acid residues, four of which represent nonconservative changes (T13N, Q22K, N71S, and R104T). CRAD2 differs from CRAD1 by only five amino acids of the first 115, four of which are nonconservative (E20V, N43T, Q68E, and A92T). RoDH1, identical to RoDH3 in this area, and CRAD1 also differ by only five amino acids of the first 115 N-terminal residues: three changes are nonconservative (T13N, Q22K, and N71S). This region contains the cofactor-binding site, the conserved SDR sequence LVNNAG, and a putative membrane-anchoring sequence. Outside of this group of five SDRs (CRAD1, CRAD2, and RoDH1–3), rat 17β-HSD6 has the closest amino acid similarity and identity to CRAD2 (Table I). The SDR that catalyzes 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenation has less sequence similarity to CRAD2 than does 17β-HSD6, suggesting that the CRADs and RoDHs belong to a distinct subgroup of SDRs that may not include the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (8Simon A.

The retinoid-associated SDRs (RoDH1–3, CRAD1, and 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase), in contrast, are cysteine-rich, with six to seven cysteine residues each. CRAD2 represents the most cysteine-rich one, with eight cysteine residues. Five of these are conserved (Cys-37, Cys-60, Cys-176, Cys-256, and Cys-266) in all known retinoid-associated SDRs, and a sixth (Cys-274) is conserved in all but the 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenase (8Simon A.

CRAD2 expressed transiently in CHO cells had ∼10-fold higher rates of activity with NADversus NADP (Table II). CRAD2 showed cooperative kinetics with 3α-adiol (3α-hydroxydehydrogenase activity) and testosterone (17β-hydroxydehydrogenase activity), with Hill coefficients of 1.9 ± 0.3 (mean ± S.D.,n = 4) and 1.5 ± 0.3 (n = 3), respectively (Fig. 2). TheV/K0.5 value for testosterone was ∼8-fold lower than that for 3α-adiol, indicating much more potent androgen 3α-hydroxydehydrogenase than 17β-hydroxydehydrogenase activity (Table III). Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed with androsterone, but 3α-hydroxydehydrogenase activity with androsterone was 6-fold lower than with 3α-adiol. CRAD2 was not saturated kinetically with 25 μmdihydrotestosterone, which had a rate of androstanedione (5α-androstan-3,17-dione) formation of 3.6 nmol/min/mg. No products were detected after incubations with estradiol or corticosterone. Among the retinoid substrates, CRAD2 showed the highest rate with 11-cis-retinol and was 8-fold less efficient for all-trans-retinol.

Northern blot hybridization revealed intense expression of CRAD2 mRNA in mouse liver, with the most intense signal at 1.7 kb and two less intense signals at 3.5 and 2.9 kb (Fig. 4). Lung also showed the 1.7-kb mRNA, albeit at ∼3% of the 1.7-kb liver signal. In comparison, CRAD1 was expressed very intensely in both liver and kidney, with major mRNA species at 3.5 and 2.7 kb in both tissues, a major 3.0-kb band in liver only, and a weaker 4.4-kb band in liver and kidney. RoDH isozymes 1–3 showed a single 1.7-kb band in liver by Northern blot analysis (4Chai X. Boerman M.H.E.M. Zhai Y. Napoli J.L. J. Biol.

The cDNA-derived CMMP sequence contains 472 amino acids including a putative 19-residue signal peptide and a unique cysteine in the catalytic domain, an insertion in a sequence motif that binds the structural (noncatalytic) zinc of MMPs. Strikingly, a homologously inserted cysteine is also found in Xenopus XMMP and human MMP19, two recently cloned novel members of the MMP family. Phylogenetic analysis suggest that XMMP and MMP19 represent founding members of the MMP family, whereas CMMP is related to collagenase MMPs. Bacterially produced recombinant CMMP (without the amino-terminal inhibition domain), which was autoproteolyzed at the carboxyl-terminal domain, digested casein and gelatin. As shown by Northern blotting, CMMP mRNA of 1.8 kilobase pairs was constitutively expressed in cultured primary chicken embryo fibroblasts and up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α and the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, but it was not regulated by interleukin-1, basic fibroblast growth factor, or retinoic acid.

MMPs share similar domains with distinct structure and function, have wide and often overlapping substrate specificities, and are usually grouped as collagenases, gelatinases, stromelysins, and membrane-type MMPs.Collagenases are the only enzymes that can cleave the triple helical regions of interstitial fibrillar collagens such as collagen types I, II, and III, the most abundant proteins in the body. The cleavage occurs at one specific peptide bond, Gly775–Ile776 (Leu776 in the α2(I)-chain) in type I collagen and leads to unfolding and denaturation of the fibrillar collagens. Gelatinases A and B, also known as 72- and 92-kDa type IV collagenases, digest denatured collagen (gelatin) and components of basement membranes, a special type of ECM of epithelial, endothelial, fat, muscle, and peripheral nerve cells (10Martin G.R. Timpl R. Kuhn K. Adv. Prot. Chem. 1988; 39: 1-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Stromelysins are three different MMPs with wide substrate specificity, and stromelysin-1 can degrade almost any ECM component including cartilage proteoglycans (11Bonassar L.J. Frank E.H. Murray J.C.

To study the role of ECM degradation and remodeling in early vertebrate development, we are cloning MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases from chicken embryos and cultured cells (17Yang M.

A homologously placed cysteine is found only inXenopus XMMP and human MMP19, two recently cloned novel MMPs (5Cossins J. Dudgeon T.J. Catlin G. Gearing A.J.H. Clements J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Deletion of the sequences flanking the BCL-2 open reading frame dramatically increases the level of protein expression. Transient high level BCL-2 protein expression mediated by plasmid transfection or by infection with recombinant adenovirus results in potent apoptosis of several cell lines. Detailed mutational (deletion and add-back) analysis reveals that both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences contribute to the negative modulation of protein expression from the BCL-2 open reading frame. It appears that these sequences exert the negative regulatory effect in an orientation-dependent manner. Analysis of BCL-2RNA levels indicate that elevated levels of mRNA may be the primary cause of elevated levels of protein expression. Apoptosis induced by adenovirus vectors expressing elevated levels of BCL-2 can be readily inhibited by the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, suggesting that high levels of BCL-2 expression induce apoptosis via the caspase cascade. Mutational analysis of BCL-2 indicates that its pro-apoptotic activity is separable from its anti-apoptosis activity. Our results raise the possibility that oncogenic conversion of BCL-2 may require somatic mutations in the pro-apoptotic activity, in addition to other activating mutations that result in enhanced expression.

Consistent with this hypothesis, a somatic mutation of BCL-2 observed in multiple human tumors results in reduced apoptosis activity. It is well established that the BCL-2 proto-oncogene suppresses apoptosis induced by a multitude of stimuli in a variety of cell types (1Korsmeyer S.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 879-886Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2390) Google Scholar). In a seminal study by Vaux et al. (3Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar),BCL-2 was shown to extend the survival of growth factor-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cells after factor withdrawal. In subsequent studies by Hockenbery et al. (4Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3530) Google Scholar), it was shown that BCL-2 promotes survival of such factor-dependent cells by suppressing apoptosis. Most studies on the anti-apoptosis activity of BCL-2 have been based on stable cell lines (selected after transfection ofBCL-2 expression vectors) that ectopically express elevated levels of BCL-2. In addition to the anti-apoptosis activity, recent studies have revealed that BCL-2 exhibits other novel activities. For example, BCL-2 has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation (5Pietenpol J.A.

BCL-2 has also been shown to promote cell proliferation in the central nervous system (10Chen D.F. Schneuder G.E. Martinou J. Tonegawa S. Nature. 1997; 385: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The human BCL-2 gene is characterized by unusually long 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (11Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 12Bakhshi A. Jensen J.P. Goldman P. Wright J.J. McBride O.W. Epstein A.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The functions of the unusually long untranslated regions are not known. Interestingly, the 5′- untranslated region contains a sequence element that negatively regulates translation of BCL-2 (15Harigai M. Miyashita T. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1369-1374PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that deletion of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences results in a large increase in BCL-2 protein expression, which results in cell death via the CED-3/ICE family caspase cascade. pcDNA3Bcl2 was constructed by cloning anEcoRI fragment from the plasmid pSFFV-BCL-2 (no. 58) (14Seto M.

The PCR product was digested with SalI and cloned into theEcoRV and XhoI sites of pcDNA3. pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR + 3′-UTR was made by replacing a C-terminal fragment (BamHI/XbaI) of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR with a C-terminal fragment (BamHI/XbaI) from pcDNA3-Bcl2. pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR + 3′- + 5′-UTR was constructed by replacing a C-terminal fragment (SacII/XbaI) of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR + 5′-UTR with that of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR + 3′-UTR. pcDNA3-Bcl2 − 5′-UTR was generated by digestion of pcDNA3-Bcl2 with HindIII and EcoNI (partial) followed by blunt-end ligation. pcDNA3-Bcl2 − 3′-UTR was made by cloning the fragment generated by PstI (blunted) andEcoRI from pSFFV-Bcl2 into pcDNA3 betweenEcoRI and EcoRV sites. pcDNA3-Bcl2 − 5′- − 3′-UTR was made by deletion of a KpnI andEcoNI (partial) fragment from pcDNA3-Bcl2 − 3′-UTR. pcDNA3-Bcl2 + 3′-UTR-I was constructed by reversing the orientation of the appropriate PstI-generated fragment of pcDNA3-Bcl2 (no. 58). pcDNA3-Bcl2 + 3′-UTR-H by substituting a 1-kb fragment of pBR322 (NheI and blunted BsmI) for a 1-kb fragment of pcDNA3-Bcl2 (no. 58) between PstI (partial, blunt ended) and XbaI sites. All PCR reactions were carried out using Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) in 5% Me2SO. The clones derived from PCR amplification were sequenced by dideoxy or by automated sequencing. The BCL-2expression cassettes, from plasmids pcDNA3-Bcl2 and pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR, and the lacZ expression cassette, from plasmid pCMV-β-galactosidase, were cloned into the adenovirus transfer vector pAdLTR (17Venkatesh L.K. Arens M.Q. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8746-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) between unique XhoI andBglII sites. To construct the recombinant adenoviruses, 5 μg of each of the transfer plasmid was cotransfected with 5 μg of the adenovirus genomic plasmid pBHGE3 (18Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) into 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. Seven days after transfection, plaques were picked and screened for the presence of the transgene by restriction analysis. Positives plaques were further purified through a second plaque assay, amplified and titrated in 293 cells. In these recombinants, the transgenes are expressed under the control of CMV-IE promoter and interleukin-2 poly(A) site. Transient cell death assays were carried out using the human 293 cell line. Cells were transfected at 60% confluency with 1.6 μg of various expression plasmids and 0.4 μg of the reporter plasmid pCMV-β-galactosidase by the calcium phosphate method in 12-well plates. Eight hours after transfection cells were fixed and stained with X-gal (19Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The number of blue cells was counted, and the number of round (apoptotic) cells compared with the total blue cell count was determined. Two different cell death assays were used to determine the effect of adenovirus vectors. In the first assay, cell viability was determined by vital stain exclusion (trypan blue). In the second assay, cell viability was determined by measuring mitochondrial viability (MTT assay). In the vital dye exclusion assay, 5 × 105cells/35-mm2 dish were infected with 100 plaque-forming units of various viruses in 2 ml of DMEM containing 2% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours after infection, adherent cells were collected by treatment with 0.5 ml of trypsin-EDTA solution and combined with the floating cells collected from the culture media. The suspension was mixed with an equal volume of trypan blue (0.4% solution in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells that excluded the dye were counted. For MTT assays (20Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar), cells were plated in 96-well tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and incubated overnight. The following day, triplicate wells of cells at approximately 50% confluency were infected with various multiplicities of infection resulting in an infection rate of ≥90% (as determined by X-gal staining of companion cultures infected with Ad-lacZ). Viruses were added in 50 μl of DMEM containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum for 4 h at 37 °C. An additional 150 μl of DMEM containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum were then added, and the cells were cultured overnight. After an overnight infection, the media were replaced with 200 μl of DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. At 45–48 h post-initiation of infection, 50 μl of MTT (Sigma M-5655, 5 mg/ml stock in phosphate-buffered saline, diluted to 1 mg/ml of culture medium) were added and incubated for additional 4 h. Media were aspirated, cell monolayers were solubilized in 150 μl of Me2SO, and the absorbance at 545 nm was determined. The data are plotted as percentages of the average of 12 wells of noninfected cells used as the control. 293 cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were infected at 100 plaque-forming units/cell. Twenty-four hours later, adherent and floating cells were collected and lysed, and small molecular weight DNA was prepared by Hirt extraction (21Subramanian T. Tarodi B. Chinnadurai G. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 131-137PubMed Google Scholar), treated with RNase, and analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. 3.4 × 104 MCF-7 cells were plated in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours after plating, cells were infected at 300 plaque-forming units/cell in 250 μl of serum-free DMEM for 4 h at 37 °C. Virus-containing media were aspirated and replaced with fresh DMEM containing 2.5% fetal calf serum. At various times post-infection, adherent cells from triplicate wells were harvested and pooled, and lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and the equivalent of 7.5 × 104 adherent cells were loaded per lane of a 16% minigel (Novex). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred onto a 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a mouse anti-human BCL-2 primary antibody (Dako, MO887) at 1:300 dilution, followed by a sheep anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Amersham NA931 used at 1:5000 dilution) and chemiluminescent detection (Amersham Corp.). For the analysis of transiently transfected cells, 293 cells were transfected at 60% confluency in 35-mm dishes with 4 μg of total DNA. Nine and a half hours later, cells were lysed in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer, and 10-μl samples were loaded onto a 15% gel SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. A rabbit anti-glutathioneS-transferase-BCL-2 polyclonal serum (1:1000) and donkey anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham NA934 at 1:3000) were used to detect BCL-2. Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using RNAzol B solution (TEL-TEST Inc.) and purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation. 12 μg of RNA were loaded in each lane, subjected to electrophoresis in a formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Duralon nylon membrane (Stratagene), and hybridized with theBCL-2 probe. The probe was prepared by random primed extension (DuPont) and the HindIII/XbaI fragment from pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR as the template. The human BCL-2cDNA contains 1.4 kb of 5′- and 3.9 kb of 3′-untranslated sequences (Fig. 1 A). A widely used cDNA clone (clone no. 58) (14Seto M. Jaeger U. Hockett R.D. Graninger W. Bennertt S. Goldman P. Korsmeyer S.J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) contains 58 bp of 5′- and 900 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences. We constructed a derivative of this cDNA clone by PCR that lacks the untranslated sequences (pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR). We observed that, after transfection of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR, the number of G418-resistant colonies induced was substantially lower than that induced either by the pcDNA3 empty vector or the vector expressing the parental cDNA (pcDNA3-Bcl2). This finding prompted us to examine whether the clone lacking the untranslated regions (pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR) caused any cell death in transfected cells. For this purpose, 293 cells were transfected with a reporter plasmid expressing the Escherichia coli lacZ gene along with the pDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-Bcl2 or pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR. Cells expressing β-galactosidase were detected by X-gal staining, and the percent of apoptotic cells was calculated from the number of round and fragmenting blue cells out of the total number of blue cells (19Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Transfection of the pcDNA3 vector or the vector expressing the parental cDNA (pcDNA3-Bcl2) did not induce significant cell death (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, about 80% of the cells transfected with pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR were round. The observed cell death activity of BCL-2 was confirmed with two different independently derived clones that lack the flanking sequences (not shown). None of the pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR clones contained any mutations compared with parental cDNA. Similar results were also obtained with a different human BCL-2 cDNA (11Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad, Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and a mouse BCL-2 cDNA (22Negrini M. Silini E. Kozak C. Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 455-463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To further substantiate the above results, we constructed recombinant adenoviruses that express the two versions of the BCL-2 cDNA. The effects of the recombinant adenoviruses on cell viability of three different human cell lines were determined by the MTT assay. Infection of cell lines MRC-5, MCF-7, and DU145 with an adenovirus vector expressing the E. coli lacZ gene (AdΔE1-lacZ) did not result in significant cell death compared with uninfected control cells (Fig. 2). Similarly, infection with the vector that expresses the parental cDNA clone (AdΔE1-Bcl2) also did not result in any significant cell death. In contrast, infection with the adenovirus vector expressing theBCL-2 cDNA lacking the flanking sequences (AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR) resulted in severe cell death in MRC-5 (Fig. 2 A). Similarly, infection of MCF-7 and DU145 cells with AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR also resulted in significant cell death (Fig. 2,B and C), although the effect on DU145 was less pronounced (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate that theBCL-2 cDNA lacking the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences induce cell death during transient expression. It should be noted that the DU145 cell line is resistant to apoptosis induced by Fas and tumor necrosis factor-α (23Rokhlin O.W. Bishop G.A. Hostager B.S. Waldschmidt T.J. Sidorenko S.P. Pavloff N. Kiefer M.C. Umansky S.R. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1758-1768PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the possible mechanism by which the flanking sequences dictate the opposing activities of BCL-2, we determined the levels of expression ofBCL-2 mRNA and protein. These levels were determined from MCF-7 cells infected with AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR or AdΔE1-Bcl2. Total cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from infected cells (adherent and floating) and analyzed by Northern blot analysis. In cells infected with AdΔE1-Bcl2, an mRNA band of 2.6 kb (that corresponds to the BCL-2 ORF and flanking vector sequences) was observed (Fig. 3 A). In cells infected with AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR, significantly higher levels of a 1.2-kb mRNA were observed. These results suggest that deletion of the flanking sequences of the BCL-2 cDNA significantly increases the level of BCL-2 mRNA expression. The levels of BCL-2 protein expression in cells infected with the adenovirus vectors expressing the two versions of the BCL-2cDNA were also analyzed (Fig. 3 B). Adherent and floating cells were collected at various times after infection and analyzed by Western blot analysis. At various times after infection, the level of BCL-2 protein expression was consistently higher in cells (both adherent and floating) infected with AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR. Similar results were also obtained with two other cell lines infected with adenovirus vectors and in cells transiently transfected with plasmid expression vectors (results not shown). These results clearly indicate that deletion of the flanking sequences of the BCL-2cDNA dramatically increases the level of mRNA and protein expression. To determine the role of the 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences separately, we constructed a series of add-back mutants by adding either the 5′- or the 3′-flanking sequences (by PCR) to pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, a series of 5′- or 3′-deletion mutants of pcDNA3-Bcl2 were also constucted by exploiting conveniently located restriction sites (Fig. 4 B). The cell death activities of the various mutants were then determined by transient transfection (Fig. 4 D) as described in the legend to Fig. 1 B. Addition of the 5′-flanking sequences to pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR (+5′ in Fig. 4 D) reduced the cell death activity of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR. Similarly, addition of the 3′-flanking sequences also reduced cell death activity (+3′ in Fig. 4 D). Addition of both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences significantly reduced the cell death activity, close to the level of pcDNA3-Bcl2. Comparable results were obtained by analysis of deletion mutants (Fig. 4 B). Deletion of the 5′-untranslated region (−7; EcoNI) increased the apoptosis activity of pcDNA3-Bcl2. Similarly, deletion of the 3′-flanking sequences (+752; PstI) also increased the apoptotic activity. Deletion of both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences increased the apoptotic activity in an additive manner. These results provide evidence that both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences have a combinatorial effect in modulating the cell death activity of BCL-2. To determine if the flanking sequences have any orientation-independent effect, we examined the effect of a construct in which the orientation of the 3′-flanking sequence was inverted (+3′-UTR-I in Fig. 4 C). Similarly, we also examined the effect of a construct in which we substituted the 3′-flanking sequence with a heterologous DNA (+3′-UTR-H in Fig. 4 C). The apoptotic activities of both these constructs were similar to that of the construct that lacks the 3′-UTR (Δ3′-UTR), suggesting that the flanking sequences may function only in transcriptional orientation (Fig. 4 E). To determine if the apoptotic activity of BCL-2 is linked to its anti-apoptotic activity, we examined the effect of two previously characterized mutants, G145E (BH1) and W188A (BH2) which were found to be severely defective in the anti-apoptotic activity (24Yin X-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The BH2 mutant (W188A) did not significantly affect the apoptotic activity (Fig. 5). In contrast, the BH1 mutant (G145E) exhibited significantly reduced apoptotic activity (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the pro- and anti-apoptotic activities of BCL-2 are separable and that a protein region located around the BH1 domain may be important for the apoptotic activity. Since CED-3/ICE family caspases are activated during apoptosis induced by several different stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 25Skowronski E.W. Kolesnick R.N. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 1996; 3: 171-176PubMed Google Scholar and 26Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 555-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined if the cell death induced by higher levels of BCL-2 expression is also dependent on caspases (Fig. 6, A and B). 293 cells infected with AdΔE1-BCL-2ΔUTR induced extensive internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 6 A, left panel). In contrast, there was no significant DNA fragmentation in mock-infected cells or in cells infected either with AdΔE1-lacZ or AdΔE1-BCL-2. We then examined if the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk can inhibit DNA fragmentation induced by AdΔE1-BCL-2ΔUTR. Addition of 25 or 50 μm z-VAD-fmk significantly inhibited the extent of DNA fragmentation induced by AdΔE1-BCL-2ΔUTR. Similarly, addition of z-VAD-fmk also inhibited the extent of cell death (determined by vital dye exclusion) induced by AdΔE1-BCL-2ΔUTR (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that a distal step in the cell death pathway activated by infection with AdΔE1-Bcl2ΔUTR may involve caspases. Expression of BCL-2 is activated in a number of human tumors. Our results raise the possibility that oncogenic conversion of BCL-2 may require somatic mutations in the pro-apoptotic activity, in addition to other activating mutations that result in enhanced expression. To test this hypothesis, we examined the apoptotic activity of a BCL-2 mutant, P59S, located within the nonconserved region of BCL-2. This mutant was chosen since mutations involving the Pro59 residue (Pro59 → Ser or Pro59 → Leu) have been detected in three different human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (27Tanaka S. Louie D.C. Kant J.A. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 79: 229-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Matolcsy A. Casali P. Warnke R.A. Knowles D.M. Blood. 1996; 88: 3937-3944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P59S mutant has previously been shown to efficiently protect against apoptosis (27Tanaka S. Louie D.C. Kant J.A. Reed J.C. Blood. 1992; 79: 229-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2E. J. Uhlmann and G. Chinnadurai, unpublished results. Transient transfection of the plasmid containing this mutant (pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR/P59S; lacking the flanking sequences) or pcDNA3 Bcl2ΔUTR expressed elevated levels of BCL-2 compared with cells transfected with pcDNA3-Bcl2 (wild type) (Fig. 7 A), as expected. Transfection of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR/P59S consistently exhibited less pronounced cell death compared with pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR (Fig. 7 B). These results suggest that at least one of the somatic mutations observed in human tumors exhibit a reduced apoptosis activity. In this communication, we have identified a surprising cell death activity of BCL-2 manifested during high levels of transient protein expression. We believe that a similar activity has not thus far been identified since most assays used to determine the activity of BCL-2 have employed cell lines that have been selected to grow in tissue culture. It should be noted that cell lines established by transfection of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR also protect against cell death similar to cell lines established by transfection of pcDNA3-Bcl2 (not shown), suggesting that cells transfected with pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR get selected for survival during the selection procedure. We believe that our results may, at least partially, explain the effect of BCL-2 reported by Pietenpol et al. (5Pietenpol J.A. Papadopoulos Markowitz S. Willson J.K.V. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3714-3717PubMed Google Scholar). These investigators have observed that transfection of a BCL-2 expression vector in certain tumor cell lines strongly inhibited G418-resistant colony formation. Employing one of the tumor cell lines, SW480, used by these investigators, we have observed that transfection of pcDNA3-Bcl2ΔUTR strongly reduced the G418-resistant colony number compared with cells transfected with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-Bcl2 (not shown). Our study does not address the physiological relevance of the cell death activity of BCL-2. However, the observation that CED-9, theCaenorhabditis elegans anti-cell death protein also contains a minor cell death activity (29Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 319-320Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the cell death activity of BCL-2 may also be physiologically relevant under certain yet unidentified settings. It could be speculated that the unusually long flanking sequences of the BCL-2 gene might have evolved to regulate the opposing activities of BCL-2 protein. Under certain physiological or pathological conditions, shorter transcripts may be generated, and such transcripts may be preferentially translated leading to cell death rather than survival. There is some basis for such a speculation, because theBCL-2 gene has also been shown to be transcribed from a minor promoter (30Young R.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3686-3697Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), resulting in a transcript that would have a 5′ end similar to the 5′ ends of the mutants described here. The presence of a separate cis-acting translational inhibitory sequence in the 5′-untranslated sequences (15Harigai M. Miyashita T. Hanada M. Reed J.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1369-1374PubMed Google Scholar) also lends support for negative regulation of BCL-2 protein expression by flanking sequences. The modulation of BCL-2 expression by the flanking sequences would be similar to the role of the 3′- flanking sequences in regulation of p53 protein expression in response to DNA damage (31Fu L.N. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4125-5117Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have observed that deletion of the UTRs enhanced BCL-2 mRNA accumulation and protein expression. It is possible that transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation such as mRNA stability may contribute to increased accumulation ofBCL-2 mRNA. Although we have observed both elevated levels of mRNA and protein expression, the role of flanking sequences in negative modulation of translational efficiency cannot be ruled out. Interestingly, we have observed that both 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences of the BCL-2 mRNA could potentially form extensive secondary structures (not shown). It is possible that such secondary structures may also suppress translational efficiency of the BCL-2 mRNA. The molecular basis by which elevated levels of BCL-2 induce cell death is not known. It is possible that, during high level expression of BCL-2, N-terminal-deleted versions are expressed from internal translational initiation sites. Under certain conditions, we have observed a 24-kDa polypeptide (see Fig. 3 B), in addition to the 26-kDa polypeptide. We believe that the 24-kDa polypeptide is translated from an internal initiation codon corresponding to Met16 since a BCL-2 mutant ΔUTR/M16L does not produce the 24-kDa band (not shown). The mutant M16L (Met16 → Leu) still induces cell death, suggesting that the cell death activity observed in our studies may be primarily contributed by the 26-kDa BCL-2. However, we cannot fully rule out the role of other truncated versions generated during high levels of expression being pro-apoptotic. A hypothesis would be that higher levels of BCL-2 might result in formation of dimers and oligomers that may be pro-apoptotic. Under conditions of relatively lower levels of protein expression, BCL-2 may function as a monomer with anti-apoptosis activity. In this context, it has been shown that BCL-xL folds as a monomer in solution (32Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that both BCL-xL(32Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E.

A. 1997; 94: 11357-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), and BCL-2 has been shown to block leakage of cytochrome c into the cytosol (35Yang J. Liu X.S. Bhalla K. Kim C.N. Ibrado A.M. Cai J.Y. Peng T.I. Jones D.P. Wang X.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4395) Google Scholar, 36Kluck R.M. Bossywetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4266) Google Scholar). BCL-2 has been shown to form channels with larger conductances, suggesting the formation of BCL-2 dimers and oligomers in the membrane (33Schendel S.L. Xie Z.H. Montal M.O. Matsuyama S. Montal M. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It is possible that, above a threshold level, BCL-2 may cause constitutive loss of cytochrome c or other apoptotic factors from the mitochondria by forming megapores. BCL-2 retains the BH3 domain essential for the death activity of the pro-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family (37Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom s Avery B.J. Ebb R.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis suggests that pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities of BCL-2 are separable. It remains to be determined if the cell death activity of BCL-2 is mechanistically similar to the known pro-apoptotic proteins. Recent studies from several laboratories suggest that CED-9 promotes cell survival by simultaneously sequestering the cell death proteins CED-4 and CED-3 (reviewed in Refs. 40Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 41Vaux D.L. Cell. 1997; 90: 389-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 388: 714-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If BCL-2 also functions by a similar mechanism, it is possible that homodimerization of BCL-2 (at higher levels of expression) may result in unsequestered BCL-2 interacting pro-apoptotic proteins resulting in cell death. The two opposing activities of the BCL-2 gene appear to be similar to the activities of other oncogenes, such c-myc andE1a, which promote cell proliferation as well as cell death. Interestingly, two pro-apoptotic proteins of the BCL-2 family, BAK (43Chittenden T. Harrington E.A. O'Connor R. Flemington C. Lutz R.J. Evan G.I. Guild B.C. Nature. 1995; 374: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) and BAX (44Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5853) Google Scholar) have been reported to suppress apoptosis under certain conditions (45Kiefer M.C. Brauer M.J. Powers V.C. Wu J.J.

Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As suggested by Evan (47Evan G. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), coupling the two opposing effects induced by a single oncogene gene may be a defense against cancer. It would be expected that the loss of the cell death activity of BCL-2 as a result of somatic mutations may also play a role in oncogenesis in addition to other activating mutations. In a sense, mutations that inactivate the apoptosis activity of BCL-2 could be considered as gain-of-function mutants that contribute to enhanced oncogenesis. Consistent with this prediction, at least one of the somatic mutations expressed at high levels that we have examined results in reduced apoptosis activity compared with comparable levels of wild type.

We recently showed that an αq deletion mutant lacking these six amino acids (in contrast to wild type αq) was able to couple to several different Gs- and Gi/o-coupled receptors, apparently due to promiscuous receptor/G protein coupling (Kostenis, E., Degtyarev, M. Y., Conklin, B. R., and Wess, J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 19107–19110). To study which specific amino acids within the N-terminal segment of αq/11 are critical for constraining the receptor coupling selectivity of these subunits, this region of αq was subjected to systematic deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis. All mutant αq constructs (or wild type αq as a control) were coexpressed (in COS-7 cells) with the m2 muscarinic or the D2 dopamine receptors, two prototypical Gi/o-coupled receptors, and ligand-induced increases in inositol phosphate production were determined as a measure of G protein activation. Surprisingly, all 14 mutant G proteins studied (but not wild type αq) gained the ability to productively interact with the two Gi/o-linked receptors. Similar results were obtained when we examined the ability of selected mutant αqsubunits to couple to the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor. Additional experiments indicated that the functional promiscuity displayed by all investigated mutant αqconstructs was not due to overexpression (as compared with wild type αq), lack of palmitoylation, or initiation of translation at a downstream ATG codon (codon seven). These data are consistent with the notion that the six-amino acid extension characteristic for αq/11 subunits forms a tightly folded protein subdomain that is critical for regulating the receptor coupling selectivity of these subunits.

In most cases, an individual GPCR can only activate a distinct subset of the many structurally similar G proteins present in each cell (7Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

How this selectivity is achieved at a molecular level is currently being explored by a great number of laboratories. A large body of evidence indicates that multiple regions on the G protein α subunits play key roles in receptor binding and dictating the selectivity of receptor/G protein interactions (2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H.

Specifically, recent studies have shown that residues at the extreme C terminus of the G protein α subunits are of fundamental importance for regulating receptor/G protein coupling selectivity (10Conklin B.R.

Hamm H.E. Nature. 1993; 363: 276-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence indicate that other regions of Gα also contribute to receptor binding and the selectivity of receptor recognition (2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 631-641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 5Rens-Domiano S. Hamm H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 6Neer E.J.

Biochemical studies suggest, for example, that the N-terminal portion of Gα may also be in contact with the receptor protein (14Hamm H.E. Deretik D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P.

An early study demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding approximately to the N-terminal αN-helix of α-transducin (Fig. 1) was able to prevent rhodopsin/transducin interactions, presumably by directly binding to rhodopsin (14Hamm H.E.

Similar findings were obtained with a photoaffinity derivative of a receptor-mimetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal portion of the third cytoplasmic loop of the α2A-adrenergic receptor (17Taylor J.M.

In addition, functional analysis of an N-terminally truncated αq subunit suggests that the N terminus of Gα subunits is also involved in modulating the fidelity of receptor/G protein recognition (18Kostenis E.

Gαq and Gα11 contain a unique six-amino acid extension (MTLESI(M)) that is not found in other Gα subunits (Fig. 1). This short sequence is highly conserved among all vertebrate species from which these subunits have been cloned so far (19Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9113-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 20Jiang M. Pandey S. Tran V.T. Fong H.K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19107-19110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the resulting mutant αq subunit (corresponding to q(Δ2-7) in Fig. 1) gained the ability to be activated by various Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors which normally do not couple efficiently to wild type (full-length) αq(qWT). Based on these results, we speculated that the N-terminal extension characteristic for αq/11 subunits may act as a “filter” by selectively preventing Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors from contacting functionally critical αq/11 residues. Alternatively, it is conceivable that the N-terminal extension exerts indirect conformational effects on adjacent αq/11 domains, such as the functionally critical C terminus, thereby constraining the selectivity of receptor/αq/11 interactions. To examine which specific amino acids within the N-terminal segment of αq/11 are critical for maintaining the selectivity of receptor recognition, we generated a large number of mutant αq subunits in which the N-terminal residues were progressively deleted or systematically replaced, either individually or in combination, with alanine. The ability of these mutant subunits to be activated by different Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors was examined in cotransfected COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, all 14 mutant αq subunits studied, but not qWT, displayed pronounced receptor coupling promiscuity. These results indicate that each single amino acid within the N-terminal extension of αq/11 subunits is critical for constraining the receptor coupling selectivity of these subunits. The most straightforward explanation for this finding is that the N-terminal portion of αq/11 forms a well defined protein subdomain that regulates the fidelity of receptor/αq/11interactions. A mouse αq cDNA (19Strathmann M. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All wild type and mutant Gαq subunits contained an internal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (DVPDYA; Ref. 24Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of the epitope tag, which replaced αqresidues 125–130, did not affect the receptor and effector coupling properties of qWT (10Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R.

Degtyarev M.Y. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19107-19110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A silent BssHII site was introduced into q(Δ2-7) at amino acid codons 18–19 to facilitate the generation of additional mutant G proteins. All mutant αq subunits were constructed by replacing a 57-base pairBamHI-BssHII fragment of q(Δ2-7) with the corresponding DNA fragments (generated via polymerase chain reaction) containing the desired deletions or substitutions (Fig. 1). In the wild type and all mutant αq plasmids, theBamHI-site of the pcDNAI polylinker was immediately followed by the initiating ATG codon. The correctness of all polymerase chain reaction-derived DNA sequences was verified by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 18–24 h later, cells were cotransfected with the indicated G protein (1 μg of DNA/dish) and receptor constructs (4 μg of DNA/dish) by using a DEAE-dextran procedure (26Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The following receptor expression plasmids were used: human m2 muscarinic receptor in pcD (27Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), human D2 dopamine receptor in pcDNAI (28Grandy D.K. Marchionni M.A. Makam H. Stofko R.E. Alfano M.

About 18–24 h after transfections, cells were split into six-well dishes (approximately 0.4 × 106 cells/well) and labeled with 3 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol (20 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.). After a 24-h labeling period, cells were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 10 mm LiCl. Cells were then stimulated with the appropriate agonists for 1 h at 37 °C, and increases in intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP1) levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography as described (30Kostenis E. Conklin B.R. Wess J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1487-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Approximately 48 h after transfections, COS-7 cells were washed twice with 10 ml of serum-free DMEM and incubated for 1 h in 5 ml of serum-free DMEM (37 °C, 5% CO2). Following removal of the medium, cells were metabolically labeled for 16 h with 200 μCi/ml [9,10-3H]palmitate (50.0 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) in 3 ml of DMEM containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum (37 °C, 5% CO2). After the 16-h labeling period, cells were washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% SDS, and incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, 200 μl of extraction buffer (composition: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mmEDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added, and samples were tumbled for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material and nuclei were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 rpm in a refrigerated Eppendorf 5417R microcentrifuge. Supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of buffer A and 20 μl of Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma) coupled to the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) (the antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's (Sigma) instructions). Samples were tumbled for 2 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to gently pellet the Sepharose beads. Pellets were washed twice with 500 μl of a 1:5 dilution of extraction buffer and resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) without reducing agents. After heating the samples for 10 min at 70 °C, the beads were pelleted gently (same conditions as above), and supernatants were used for SDS-PAGE (13%). Gels loaded with 10% of the total sample volumes were subjected to Western blotting (see below). Gels run with the remaining 90% of the samples were soaked in 20–30 ml of Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International Corp.) for 30 min, dried, and subjected to fluorography at −80 °C for 4–6 weeks. All wild type and mutant Gαqsubunits were detected with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody directed against the HA-epitope tag present in all G protein constructs. Samples containing 20 μg of membrane protein prepared from transfected COS-7 cells were resolved by SDS-PAGE (13%), electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with the 12CA5 antibody as described (11Liu J.

Immunoreactive proteins were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All ligands used in this study were purchased from Research Biochemicals Inc. The remaining chemicals were obtained through Sigma. Initially we prepared two series of N-terminally modified mutant αq subunits (Fig. 1). In one series, amino acids 2–7 (TLESIM) of mouse αq were progressively removed leading to six αq deletion constructs (note that q(Δ2-7) was previously referred to as -6q; Ref. 18Kostenis E. Degtyarev M.Y. Conklin B.R. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19107-19110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In the other series, these residues were replaced, either individually (yielding six αq single point mutants) or in combination (resulting in q(TLE → AAA) and q(SI → AA)) (Fig. 1). All wild type and mutant αq subunits contained an internal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag replacing αq residues 125–130. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of the epitope tag does not affect the receptor and effector coupling properties of qWT (10Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 11Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western analysis using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) showed that all mutant αq subunits were properly expressed at levels similar to or somewhat lower than observed with qWT (Fig. 2). To study the effects of the different mutations on the fidelity of receptor/G protein interactions, all mutant αq subunits were initially coexpressed (in COS-7 cells) with the m2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypical Gi/o-coupled receptor (32Peralta E.G. Ashkenazi A. Winslow J.W. Ramachandran J. Capon D.J. Nature. 1988; 334: 434-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 33Offermanns S. Wieland T. Homann D. Sandmann J. Bombien E. Spicher K. Schultz G. Jakobs K.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 890-898PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected cells were then incubated with the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (0.5 mm), and the ability of the m2 muscarinic receptor to couple to the different G proteins was determined by measuring increases in inositol phosphate production (due to αq-mediated activation of PLCβ; Refs. 34Smrcka A.V. Hepler J.R. Brown K.O. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1991; 251: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar and 35Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of the m2 receptor with either vector DNA (pcDNAI) or qWT, followed by ligand stimulation, resulted only in a relatively small increase in PLCβ activity (approximately 3-fold; Fig. 3), a response known to be largely due to activation of PLCβ isozymes by G protein βγ subunits released upon m2 receptor-mediated activation of endogenous Gi/o proteins (36Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 37Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschick P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the m2 muscarinic receptor gained the ability to productively couple to all 14 mutant αq subunits, resulting in a 6–11-fold stimulation of PLC activity (Fig. 3). Essentially similar findings were obtained when we studied the ability of the D2 dopamine receptor, another Gi/o-coupled receptor, to interact with the various mutant G proteins. When coexpressed with qWT, the D2 receptor, upon stimulation with the selective D2 agonist, (−)-quinpirole (10 μm), was unable to induce an appreciable degree of PLC stimulation (Fig. 4). However, in the presence of either of the 14 mutant αq subunits studied, a significant increase in inositol phosphate production was observed (ranging from 2- to 6-fold above basal; Fig. 4). We next examined the ability of the Gs-coupled β2-adrenergic receptor to interact functionally with selected mutant αq subunits (q(Δ2-7), q(T2A), q(L3A), q(E4A), q(S5A), q(I6A), and q(M7A)). Consistent with its known coupling preference (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), this receptor subtype, when stimulated with (−)-isoproterenol (200 μm), was unable to activate efficiently qWT (Fig. 5), mediating only an approximately 1.5-fold increase in IP production. However, the β2-adrenergic receptor gained the ability to interact productively with all examined mutant αq subunits, leading to a 3–5-fold stimulation of PLC activity (Fig. 5). As described above, all investigated mutant αq subunits showed similar functional properties, displaying coupling promiscuity upon coexpression with different Gi/o- and Gs-coupled receptors. As shown in Figs. 1 and6 A, the N-terminal six-amino acid extension (MTLESI) characteristic for αq subunits is immediately followed by a second in-frame methionine codon (codon seven). If this second rather than the first methionine codon is used as a translation start site, all αq constructs would direct the synthesis of the same N-terminally truncated protein (corresponding to q(Δ2-7)). To exclude such a mechanism as a potential cause of the observed functional promiscuity displayed by the different mutant αq subunits, an additional experiment was designed. Frameshift mutations were introduced between the two N-terminal ATG codons (codons one and seven), using two mutant αq constructs, q(L3A) and q(E4A), as model systems (Fig. 6 A). In q(L3A)-FS, the deletion of a single nucleotide (C) within codon three in q(L3A) led to a shift of the amino acid reading frame resulting in a premature stop codon after 10 amino acids of nonsense sequence. In q(E4A)-FS, the insertion of a single nucleotide (C) after codon four in q(E4A) led to a changed amino acid reading frame and a premature stop codon after 59 amino acids of nonsense sequence (Fig. 6 A). If codon seven is in fact used as a translation start site, q(L3A)-FS and q(E4A)-FS would be expected to exhibit functional properties similar to those of q(L3A) and q(E4A), respectively. However, coexpression studies showed that the two frameshifted mutant αq constructs, in contrast to q(L3A) and q(E4A), were unable to interact with the m2 muscarinic receptor (Fig. 6 B). Following ligand stimulation (carbachol, 0.5 mm) of the m2 muscarinic receptor, q(L3A) and q(E4A) were capable of mediating a pronounced increase in inositol phosphate production (7–8-fold above basal), whereas the responses observed with q(L3A)-FS and q(E4A)-FS were not significantly different from those found with vector-transfected control cells (approximately 3-fold above basal; Fig. 6 B). In addition to the functional studies, G protein expression was monitored by Western analysis using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7). Whereas q(L3A) and q(E4A) were found to be properly expressed in a fashion similar to qWT (detectable at 42–45 kDa), no αq protein was detected after transfection with the q(L3A)-FS and q(E4A)-FS mutant constructs (Fig. 7, lanes 3 and 5). In this set of experiments, a weak nonspecific band of >50 kDa was observed in all lanes (including vector control), indicating that it represents a cross-reacting COS-7 cell protein. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that the second methionine codon (codon seven) is not used (at least not to a detectable degree) as a translation start site in the studied mutant αq constructs. Previous studies (24Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T. Levis M.J. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25001-25008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Edgerton M.D. Chabert C.

We therefore wanted to examine whether the promiscuous mutant αq subunits differed from qWT in their palmitoylation patterns. Toward this goal, COS-7 cells transfected with qWT or selected mutant αqsubunits (q(Δ2-4), q(Δ2-7), q(TLE->AAA), q(SI->AA), q(T2A), and q(M7A)) were metabolically labeled with [3H]palmitic acid, followed by immunoprecipitation of αq subunits by the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Western analysis showed that the amounts of immunoprecipitated wild type and mutant αq proteins were similar (Fig. 8 A). The αqsubunits were the only immunoprecipitated proteins, since no labeled proteins were detected when cells were transfected with “empty” vector DNA. As shown in Fig. 8 B, qWT and all mutant αq subunits incorporated significant amounts of [3H]palmitate. However, the strength of the palmitoylation signal was generally weaker in the case of the mutant αq subunits (40–75% compared with qWT, as determined by scanning densitometry). The fidelity of receptor/G protein interactions critically depends on the ability of different GPCRs to discriminate between unique structural features of the Gα subunits (2Conklin B.R. Bourne H.R.

https://openalex.org/W2084966096,"We have shown previously that ADP released upon platelet adhesion mediated by αIIbβ3integrin triggers accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3′,4′-bisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4-P2) (Gironcel, D., Racaud-Sultan, C., Payrastre, B., Haricot, M., Borchert, G., Kieffer, N., Breton, M., and Chap, H. (1996) FEBS Lett. 389, 253–256). ADP has also been involved in platelet spreading. Therefore, in order to study a possible role of phosphoinositide 3-kinase in platelet morphological changes following adhesion, human platelets were pretreated with specific phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. Under conditions where PtdIns-3,4-P2synthesis was totally inhibited (25 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin), platelets adhered to the fibrinogen matrix, extended pseudopodia, but did not spread. Moreover, addition of ADP to the medium did not reverse the inhibitory effects of phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors on platelet spreading. Although synthetic dipalmitoyl PtdIns-3,4-P2 and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylinositol 3′,4′,5′-trisphosphate restored only partially platelet spreading, phosphatidylinositol 4′,5′-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) was able to trigger full spreading of wortmannin-treated adherent platelets. Following 32P labeling of intact platelets, the recovery of [32P]PtdIns-4,5-P2 in anti-talin immunoprecipitates from adherent platelets was found to be decreased upon treatment by wortmannin. These results suggest that the lipid products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are required but not sufficient for ADP-induced spreading of adherent platelets and that PtdIns-4,5-P2 could be a downstream messenger of this signaling pathway.

Platelets play a key role in hemostasis by their capacities to adhere and to aggregate in response to vascular injury. The most abundant platelet integrin, the αIIbβ3complex, is largely responsible for platelet aggregation after binding of soluble fibrinogen. Moreover, αIIbβ3integrin is required for a complete and irreversible platelet adhesion to the subendothelial matrix (1Savage B. Shattil S.J. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11300-11306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, its preferential ligand is the von Willebrand factor, but under certain conditions fibrinogen or fibrin could also act as adhesion substrates. In its resting state, αIIbβ3 integrin is able to recognize immobilized fibrinogen. However, the interaction of soluble fibrinogen with αIIbβ3 complex requires a previous conformational change of the integrin due to an inside-out signaling pathway. When platelets adhere in vitro to a fibrinogen matrix, they undergo several irreversible morphological changes such as rounding and spreading. These responses are sustained by a cytoskeletal reorganization including extension of filopodia, lamellipodia, and controlled orientation of stress fibers. It has been shown that a concomitant granular secretion of ADP from adherent platelets was necessary for spreading (2Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol.

Taking advantage of specific PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin (8Kovacsovics T.J. Bachelot C. Toker A. Vlahos C.J. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Hartwig J.H. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, our results suggest that PtdIns-4,5-P2, a phospholipid tightly associated with actin-binding proteins in focal contacts and a key regulator of actin polymerization (15Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could be a downstream messenger of this signaling pathway. Human fibrinogen, ADP, human thrombin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), apyrase, pyruvate kinase, phosphoenolpyruvate, wortmannin, PtdIns-4-P, PtdIns-4,5-P2, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were from Sigma. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the thrombospondin-1 cell binding domain peptide H-RFYVVMWK-OH, and the TXA2 analog U46619 used were, respectively, from Sigma, Bachem (Voisins-le Bretonneux, France), and Calbiochem (Meudon, France). LY294002 and GF109203X were obtained, respectively, from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Glaxo (Les Ulis, France). Synthetic Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 (dipalmitoyll-α-phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol 3, 4-bisphosphate) and Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 were purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Human platelets were isolated from fresh platelet concentrates (Centre Régional de Transfusion Sanguine, Toulouse, France) by centrifugation as described previously (16Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All washing procedures were performed at 37 °C in the presence of apyrase (1 unit/ml) as an ADP scavenger. In some experiments, platelet-rich plasma was incubated with 100 μm aspirin for 20 min to block cyclooxygenase activity. Platelets were labeled for 90 min with 0.4 mCi/ml [γ-32P]phosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bucks, United Kingdom), as described previously (16Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). They were finally resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2.5 mm CaCl2. Cell culture flasks (75 cm2, Greiner Labortechnik, Poitiers, France) were precoated or not (control) with 100 μg/ml of fibrinogen and were then blocked with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cell adhesion assay was performed using 5 ml of human platelets (3 × 107 platelets/ml) that were added for 60 min at 37 °C to the fibrinogen-coated flasks or to the control flasks. In some experiments, the ADP scavenger pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenolpyruvate (14.3 units/ml and 1 mm,respectively; 10 min) or the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X (12 μm; 60 min) or the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors LY294002 (0–25 μm; 10 min) or wortmannin (0–100 nm; 15 min) were added to the platelet suspension before adhesion. GF109203X, wortmannin, and LY294002 were dissolved in Me2SO, which did not exceed 0.06% (v/v). Recovering of adherent cells, evaluation of the extent of cell adhesion, and lipid extract analysis by HPLC were performed as described previously (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After elimination of unattached platelets and two washes with PBS, adherent wortmannin-treated platelets were incubated with different agonists (20 μm ADP, 5 μm LPA, 50 μmH-RFYVVMWK-OH, 5 μm U46619, 10 nm PMA, or 1 unit/ml thrombin) or phosphoinositides (PtdIns-4-P, PtdIns-4,5-P2, Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2, Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, or a mixture of these lipids, 10–30 μm) in Tyrode's buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Before use, phosphoinositides were dried, suspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), and sonicated in the absence of carrier phospholipids. At the end of the adhesion step or the spreading restoration assay, unattached platelets were removed by washing with PBS and the buffer was replaced by 1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m Na2HPO4. Fixation was continued at room temperature for 15 min. After washing, adherent platelets were examined by interference light microscopy with a Reichert EMF4 microscope. Micrographs were taken at original magnification ×1250. Adherent platelets (4.5 × 108 platelets) were scraped off at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μm pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Resting platelets in suspension (4.5 × 108 platelets) were centrifuged and resuspended in 600 μl of the lysis buffer. After sonication (20 kHz for 2 × 10 s) and centrifugation (12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), the soluble fraction was collected and subsequently precleared for 30 min at 4 °C with protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow (Sigma). Precleared suspensions were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the polyclonal anti-talin antibody prepared as described previously at a 1:50 dilution (17Vignoud L. Albigès-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430PubMed Google Scholar). Capture of immune complex was performed by adding 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4B fast flow. The immunoprecipitates were then washed once with PBS without calcium and magnesium, supplemented with anti-proteases as described above and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and twice with the same buffer without Triton. For lipid analysis, immunoprecipitation of talin was performed after plating of 32P-labeled platelets as described above. Lipids were extracted as described previously (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and separated by TLC following the procedure established by Pignataro and Ascoli (18Pignataro O.P. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1718-1723Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid extracts were applied on oxalate-EDTA-impregnated silica gel plates, which were developed twice for 120 min with CHCl3, CH3OH, 9.15m NH4OH (40:40:15). Individual lanes containing commercial standards PtdIns-4-P or PtdIns-4,5-P2 were stained with iodine vapors. After exposition of the plates for 3–7 days, the radioactive spots were visualized and quantitated by a PhosphorImager 445 SI (Molecular Dynamics, Inc). Quantification was also performed after scraping the appropriate areas of the plate and counting in a liquid scintillation counter. For protein analysis, anti-talin immunoprecipitates were solubilized, separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and blotted onto nitrocellulose as described previously (11Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Immunodetection of talin was performed with the mouse monoclonal anti-talin antibody 8d4 from Sigma. Antibody reaction was visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Quantification of the different bands was performed by a densitometric analysis, which determines the pixel volume in each area (Gel Doc 1000, Bio-Rad). Wortmannin and LY294002 have been largely used in platelets as specific inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase, at nanomolar (10–100 nm) and micromolar (25 μm) concentrations, respectively (8Kovacsovics T.J.

Since we have shown previously that platelet adhesion triggers accumulation of [32P]PtdIns-3,4-P2 (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we first assessed the inhibitory effects of wortmannin and LY294002 on the production of [32P]PtdIns-3,4-P2 as a reflection of PtdIns 3-kinase activation. 32P-Labeled platelets were preincubated with increasing doses of wortmannin or LY294002, and cells were then plated for 60 min on the fibrinogen matrix before lipid extraction and analysis by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1, LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited [32P]PtdIns-3,4-P2 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner with 80% inhibition achieved at 12 μm and 50 nm, respectively. The production of [32P]PtdIns-3,4-P2 was totally abrogated at 25 μm LY294002 and 100 nm wortmannin, at which concentrations platelet adhesion was not significantly affected (Table I). At these concentrations, among other phosphoinositides (PtdIns, PtdOH, PtdIns-4-P, and PtdIns-4,5-P2), only the PtdIns-4-P level was found to be somewhat decreased, but not significantly in comparison with control Me2SO-treated platelets (Fig. 2).Table IEffects of wortmannin and LY294002 on platelet adhesionAMe2SOLY294002WortmanninAdhesion ± S.E.

Calculation of adhesion percentage was as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are from five independent experiments. As described previously (21Allen R.D. Zacharski L.R. Widirstky S.T. Rosenstein R. Zaitlin L.M. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 126-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), upon adhesion, adherent platelets undergo the following steps of morphological changes: disk to sphere shape change, extension of pseudopodia, and a much slower process, cell spreading (Fig. 3, A and B). Pretreatment of platelets with wortmannin or LY294002 inhibited platelet spreading on fibrinogen (Fig. 3, C andD). However, it should be noted that, although pretreated platelets did not fully spread, they still extended pseudopodia. The inhibitory effect of LY294002 and wortmannin on cell spreading was already detectable at 6 μm and 25 nm, respectively. Concentrations of 25 μm LY294002 and 100 nm wortmannin completely prevented platelet spreading. After removing wortmannin and LY294002 from the adhesion medium by two washes, we observed that only the inhibitory effect of LY294002 was reversible after 30 min (data not shown). Indeed, LY294002 is a competitive inhibitor at the ATP-binding site of PtdIns 3-kinase (13Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas wortmannin induces a covalent modification of the catalytic site of the enzyme (14Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In agreement with Haimovich et al.(2Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pretreatment of platelets with the ADP scavenger pyruvate kinase plus phosphoenolpyruvate just before the adhesion assay induced the same effects as treatment with the PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors,i.e. absence of spreading but persistence of pseudopodal extension (Fig. 3 E). After washing, ADP (20 μm) was added to adherent platelets to overcome the ADP scavenging system. Addition of ADP restored full spreading of all adherent platelets as shown in Fig. 3 F. On the other hand, addition of 20 μm ADP to adherent platelets pretreated with wortmannin did not reverse inhibition of platelet spreading (Fig. 3 G). These data demonstrate that PtdIns 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for ADP-induced spreading of adherent platelets. Our previous measurements of PtdIns 3-kinase activation in adherent platelets (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) have shown that, although the PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 level was not significantly modified between 5 and 30 min of adhesion, PtdIns-3,4-P2 accumulated as a function of the adhesion time. Time course of PtdIns-3,4-P2 production closely paralleled platelet spreading upon adhesion (data not shown). In order to determine whether products of PtdIns 3-kinase could be involved in platelet spreading, we used Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 and Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, which were reported to trigger biologic responses when added to whole cells (7Derman M.P. Toker A. Hartwig J.H. Spokes K. Falck J.R. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6465-6470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 22Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, addition of Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 (20 μm) on adherent platelets pretreated with wortmannin only partially restored platelet spreading. After 30 min of incubation with Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2, some adherent platelets have lost their round shape and have undergone pseudopodal and hyalomere extension. Nevertheless, these modifications concerned only a small proportion of adherent platelets (5%), as compared with 35% of spread platelets obtained with non-pretreated control cells (Fig. 4 B). Using amounts of Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 between 10 and 30 μm, we obtained a dose-dependent increase in the response rate (detected as early as 15 min of adhesion) and in the proportion of responsive cells (Fig. 4 B). In no case did we observe a full spreading of platelets, even after 60 min of incubation. Addition of Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 or PtdIns-4-P or both (data not shown) together with Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 was not more efficient in restoring full spreading (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, addition of PtdIns-4,5-P2 to adherent platelets pretreated with wortmannin triggered full spreading (Fig. 4, A andB). Moreover, the number of fully spread platelets was increased by addition of both Di-C16-PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-4,5-P2 (Fig. 4 B). Nevertheless, under these conditions, the amount of fully spread platelets was far below that observed in the control situation. PtdIns-4,5-P2 effects on cell spreading are unlikely to be dependent on induction of platelet release reaction, as ADP (20 μm), LPA (5 μm), the thrombospondin-1 cell binding domain peptide (H-RFYVVMWK-OH; 50 μm), could not restore spreading of platelets treated with 100 nmwortmannin (Table II). By contrast, the TXA2 analog U46619 (5 μm) triggered full spreading of adherent platelets pretreated with 100 nmwortmannin. However, addition of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (20 μm) to adherent platelets pretreated with aspirin (100 μm) and wortmannin (100 nm) was still able to restore full platelet spreading (Table II).Table IISpreading restoration of wortmannin-treated platelets by different agonistsTreatmentAgonistSpreading restorationWortmanninADP−WortmanninLPA−WortmanninH-RFYVVMWK-OH−WortmanninTHR++++WortmanninU46619++WortmanninPMA++WortmanninPtdIns-4,5-P2+Wortmannin + aspirinPtdIns-4,5-P2+Wortmannin + GF109203XPtdIns-4,5-P2+Platelets were incubated with wortmannin (100 nm; 15 min) and/or GF 109203X (12 μm; 60 min) and then plated on the fibrinogen matrix for 60 min.

The fact that strong platelet agonists, such as thrombin (1 unit/ml), the TXA2 analog U46619, and the PKC activator PMA (10 nm), were able to restore spreading of platelets pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin (Table II) might suggest a PtdIns 3-kinase-independent pathway of platelet spreading. In order to determine a possible activation of PKC isoforms by high concentrations of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (23Kochs G. Hummel R. Fiebich B. Sarre T.F. Marmé D. Hug H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we used the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203X (24Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of platelets with GF109203X (12 μm) induced inhibition of platelet spreading as described previously by Haimovich and co-workers (4Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When platelets had been pretreated by both GF109203X (12 μm) and wortmannin (100 nm) together, exogenous PtdIns-4,5-P2 was still able to restore full spreading of adherent platelets with a similar efficiency as in the case of a pretreatment with wortmannin alone (Table II). These experiments argue in favor of a specific PtdIns-4,5-P2 effect on the restoration of cell spreading that is independent on PKC activation. The partial rescue of platelet spreading with lipids suggests that there may be additional components to the PtdIns 3-kinase-dependent pathway. We addressed the possibility that the myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) could be involved in platelet spreading. Indeed, inhibitors of MLCK have been shown to disassemble focal adhesions and to reduce their phosphotyrosine staining (25Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1384) Google Scholar), and wortmannin is a MLCK inhibitor, but at micromolar concentrations (26Nakanishi S. Kakita S. Takahashi I. Kawahara K. Tsukuda E. Sano T. Yamada K. Yoshida M. Kase H. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2157-2163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preincubation of platelets with 10 μm ML-7 (specific inhibitor of MLCK from Biomol; Ref. 27Saitoh M. Ishikawa T. Matsushima S. Naka M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7796-7801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) during the 30 min before adhesion did not modify platelet spreading (data not shown). We concluded that MLCK does not seem to be involved in platelet spreading. Since the level of [32P]PtdIns-4,5-P2 was not significantly modified in vivo upon treatment of platelets with wortmannin, we looked for possible changes of the lipid content of focal adhesion sites. Talin is a prominent actin-binding protein that links integrins and the cytoskeleton and has been shown to be required for cell spreading (28Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although some variations could be observed in the amount of talin immunoprecipitated from platelets (Fig. 5 A), mean values obtained from two experiments were essentially the same (Fig. 5 B). Under these conditions, only traces of PtdIns-4-P were recovered in anti-talin immunoprecipitates from resting platelets, whereas, after adhesion, the amount of PtdIns-4-P increased, PtdIns-4,5-P2and traces of PtdIns-3,4-P2 becoming detectable (Fig. 5 C). For instance, the amount of talin isolated from activated platelets was 1.4- and 0.9-fold (two experiments) the amount obtained from control platelets, whereas associated phospholipids were increased by 7.5- and 11-fold, respectively. This indicated that adhesion promoted specific association of phosphoinositides with talin. Moreover, by comparison with the relative amounts of polyphosphoinositides found in total platelets, there was an enrichment in PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-3,4-P2 in the anti-talin immunoprecipitates (compare Figs. 2 and 5 D). Treatment of platelets with wortmannin induced a strong decrease (60–100%) of these three lipids associated with talin (Fig. 5, C andD). Thus, we conclude that PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors may modify the association of PtdIns-4,5-P2 with talin and therefore influence its possible function in platelet spreading. We have shown previously that synthesis of PtdIns-3,4-P2 in adherent platelets is under the control of the released ADP, since addition of ADP reversed the inhibitory effects of an ADP scavenger on PtdIns-3,4-P2 synthesis (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our present results, in agreement with those of Haimovich et al.(2Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrate that ADP release occurring upon platelet adhesion is required for full platelet spreading. Thus, ADP released by adherent platelets controls both PtdIns-3,4-P2 synthesis and cell spreading. In conditions where PtdIns-3,4-P2 synthesis was totally abolished by inhibitors of PtdIns 3-kinase, we observed an inhibition of platelet spreading while pseudopodal extension was maintained. We demonstrate here that the PtdIns 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for ADP-induced spreading of adherent platelets. In order to determine which lipid is responsible for platelet spreading, we have added synthetic PtdIns-3,4-P2 and PtdIns-3,4,5-P3 to adherent wortmannin-treated platelets. PtdIns-3,4-P2 appears to be the most efficient in restoring partial spreading, i.e. pseudopodal and hyalomere extension. However, among all phosphoinositides tested, PtdIns-4,5-P2alone was able to trigger the full spreading of wortmannin-treated platelets. Although all phospholipid solutions were prepared under similar conditions, their packing into micelles or vesicules was not characterized. Moreover, differences in the acyl chains of PtdIns-3,4-P2 (palmitate) and PtdIns-4,5-P2(stearate and arachidonate) may have influenced their activity. Nevertheless, our results suggest a role for both PtdIns-4,5-P2 and lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinase in the signal transduction pathway leading to platelet spreading. We have observed a trend toward a decrease of [32P]PtdIns-4-P in adherent platelets pretreated with PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors. This result suggests that a wortmannin-sensitive PtdIns 4-kinase might exist in platelets, as has been shown in other models (30Nakanishi S. Catt K.J. Balla T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5317-5321Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 31Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4384-4390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in a cell system, wortmannin was reported to inhibit PtdIns 4-kinase at μmconcentration, and LY294002 has not been described as an inhibitor of known PtdIns 4-kinases (13Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PtdIns 3-kinase activity could be upstream of a PtdIns 4-kinase and/or a PtdIns-4-P phosphatase. Finally, even though we have not measured a significant decrease of [32P]PtdIns-4,5-P2 in whole platelets pretreated with PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors, a decrease of PtdIns-4-P level could impair the synthesis of a particular pool of PtdIns-4,5-P2 required for platelet spreading. Recent studies from the Schlessinger and Rhee laboratories (32Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 33Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) demonstrate that γ isoforms of phospholipase C (PLC) could be activated by PtdIns-3,4,5-P3, either by targeting to cell membrane through their PH domain or by direct activation through their SH2 domain. One could thus expect an increase of PtdIns-4,5-P2 level when adherent platelets have been pretreated with PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors. Nevertheless, at least two reasons could explain why in our experiments this variation is not observed. First, in our previous paper (3Gironcel D. Racaud-Sultan C. Payrastre B. Haricot M. Borchert G. Kieffer N. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we have shown that upon platelet adhesion on a fibrinogen matrix a PLC active on PtdIns-4,5-P2 was rapidly and transiently stimulated. Maximal increase of PtdOH production and PtdIns-4,5-P2decrease was observed as early as 5 min of adhesion. Thereafter, these two metabolites returned gradually to their basal level, and that corroborates the absence of PtdOH and PtdIns-4,5-P2variations after 60 min of adhesion, as shown in Fig. 2 of our present article. We thus believe that in the late steps of platelet adhesion PLC activity is not involved. However, it should be of importance to check PLC activity during the early steps of adhesion of platelets treated with PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors. Second, since our present data show a decrease of PtdIns-4-P level upon platelet treatment with PtdIns 3-kinase inhibitors, an eventual increase of the PtdIns-4,5-P2 level might be impaired. PtdIns-4,5-P2 regulates several actin-binding proteins as profilin, gelsolin, α-actinin, and vinculin (34Isenberg G. Niggli V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 73-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the major proteins of focal adhesions, talin, has been shown to be involved in cell spreading (28Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its interaction with lipids has been documented in vitro and could be of importance for talin nucleated actin polymerization (34Isenberg G. Niggli V. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 73-125Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we show that PtdIns-4,5-P2 as well as PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-3,4-P2 become associated with talin upon platelet adhesion. Moreover, treatment of platelets by wortmannin strongly reduces the amounts of polyphosphoinositides recovered in the anti-talin immunoprecipitate. Even though it remains to be determined whether this association is direct or not, our results support the notion of a possible regulation by PtdIns 3-kinase of a pool of PtdIns-4,5-P2 potentially involved in cell spreading. Hartwig et al. (35Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) have reported that D3 and D4 polyphosphoinositides uncap F-actin in resting permeabilized platelets. At low concentrations (10 μm), PtdIns-4,5-P2and PtdIns-3,4-P2 are more effective than PtdIns-3,4,5-P3. Synthesis of PtdIns-4-P and PtdIns-4,5-P2, which are correlated with the exposure of barbed filament ends, seem to be under the control of the small G protein Rac (35Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). This small G protein has been shown to regulate extension of peripheral lamellipodia (36Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar), to associate in vivo with both PtdIns 3-kinase and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase (12Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that PtdIns 3-kinase functions upstream of Rac (37Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L. Curr.

Commun. 1995; 208: 985-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-3,4-P2both regulate, in vitro, the severing and capping of the protein gelsolin (9Hartwig J.H. Kung S. Kovacsovics T. Janmey P.A. Cantley L.C. Stossel T.P. Toker A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32986-32993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), whose genetic defect is responsible for the absence of lamellae although the filopod formation is maintained, upon platelet activation (39Witke W. Sharpe A.H. Hartwig J.H. Azuma T. Stossel T.P. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Thus, in our model, PtdIns 3-kinase could regulate actin remodeling directly through PtdIns-3,4-P2synthesis and/or indirectly through PtdIns-4,5-P2synthesis. Recent results from King et al. (40King W.G. Mattaliano M.D. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4406-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), showing that spreading of COS 7 cells attached to fibronectin is delayed after treatment by wortmannin and LY294002, support the view that the PtdIns 3-kinase signaling pathway is required for cell spreading, as controlled by integrins and/or by tyrosine kinase receptors (41Symes K. Mercola M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9641-9644Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ADP released from adherent platelets supports some specific signals such as Vav phosphorylation via an indirect mechanism involving activation of αIIbβ3 (42Cichowski K. Brugge J.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7544-7550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Furthermore, an integrin-associated protein agonist peptide triggers activation of αIIbβ3 integrin resulting in platelet spreading on immobilized fibrinogen (43Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, upon platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, it remains to be clarified whether platelet spreading is secondary to the αIIbβ3 integrin engagement. We thank Dr. B. Payrastre and D. Bacqueville for helpful discussions."

However, promoter-reporter genes are inactive if the sequences upstream of the TATA box contain only SREBP binding sites (9Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

A number of studies have demonstrated that additional transcription factors, so far limited to NF-Y, Sp1, and Sp3, are necessary for high levels of transcription of SREBP-dependent genes. Detailed studies that utilized the FPP synthase proximal promoter demonstrated that the interaction of NF-Y heterotrimers with two motifs (ATTGG and CCAAT) resulted in a synergistic increase in the binding of SREBP to an adjacent motif (10Jackson S.M.

We have hypothesized that, in sterol-deprived cells, the NF-Y-dependent binding of SREBP to the FPP synthase promoter results in enhanced transcription of the gene.

Detailed studies with the LDL receptor promoter have demonstrated that SREBP binds to SRE-1 and results in a synergistic increase in the binding of Sp1 to an adjacent motif (4Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The human SREBP proteins were purified and cloned based on their ability to bind to SRE-1, a functionally important 10-base pair element previously identified in the promoter of the LDL receptor gene (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two SREBP genes were identified, SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). As a result of alternate splicing of the SREBP-1 mRNA, these two genes can produce three separate proteins,i.e.. SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Subsequent studies demonstrated that two separate SREBP complexes could form on the fatty acid synthase promoter through interactions with four distinct half sites, two of which were present in the E-box motif (18Magana M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). SREBPs are unique transcription factors that are synthesized as 125-kDa precursor proteins, anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum via two transmembrane domains (reviewed in Ref. 1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). Cellular sterol deprivation results in activation of an as yet unidentified protease that cleaves SREBPs at a specific site within the luminal loop (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). A second proteolytic event then occurs in the amino-terminal transmembrane domain of SREBP and results in the release of a 68-kDa amino-terminal fragment (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). This portion of the protein contains the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transactivation/dimerization domain and a nuclear targeting motif (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). The 68-kDa SREBP fragment enters the nucleus, binds to sterol regulatory elements, and activates transcription of target genes (see above). The mechanism of transactivation of these target genes and the role of other proteins/factors in this process have not been clearly elucidated. CBP and p300 fall into a class of proteins termed coactivators that are thought to form a bridge between DNA-specific transcriptional activators and the basal transcriptional machinery (reviewed in Refs.19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). CBP was originally identified as a result of its interaction with the cAMP response element-binding protein (22Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P., S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been established that different domains of CBP interact with a number of different transcription factors, with components of the pol II complex and with additional coactivators, such as p300- and CBP-associated factor (reviewed in Refs. 19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J.

Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). p300- and CBP-associated factor and CBP have acetyltransferase activity and, as such, are thought to be involved in the acetylation of histones and alteration of chromatin structure (21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar, 23Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem.

In a recent report, CBP was also shown to be capable of acetylating p53, a DNA-specific transcription factor (26Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2160) Google Scholar). E1A, derived from adenovirus, is known to be a multifunctional protein that affects diverse cellular functions as a result of alterations in the transcription of a large number of genes (reviewed in Refs. 19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholarand 25Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that E1A and p300- and CBP-associated factor bind to a similar domain of CBP (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of E1A in cells can lead to displacement of p300- and CBP-associated factor from CBP and a decrease in the transcription of CBP-dependent genes, presumably due to the decrease in histone/protein acetylation (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). In a recent study, Oliner et al. (27Oliner J.D. Andresen M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) demonstrated that recombinant SREBP interacted with an amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–682) of CBP. In addition, transient transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding CBP resulted in an additional 2–4-fold increase in the activity of an LDL receptor-promoter gene that had been activated by cotransfection with a plasmid encoding the 68-kDa amino-terminal fragment of SREBP (27Oliner J.D. Andresen M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These results implicate CBP in SREBP-dependent transcription of the LDL receptor gene, a process that is know to require both SREBP and Sp1 (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar, 4Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The role, if any, of Sp1, in the CBP-mediated activation has not been determined. In the current study, we investigated the role of CBP in the physiological regulation of a number of genes, the transcription of which is regulated in response to alterations in cellular sterols. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 32P-Labeled nucleotide triphosphates were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pRSETB (Invitrogen) containing both a partial sequence of SREBP-1a (amino acids 1–490), both T7 and polyhistidine tags, and pCMV-CSA10, which encodes amino acids 1–490 of SREBP-1a, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Osborne (Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine, CA). Constructs encoding E1A or Gal4- and GST-CBP fusion proteins under control of the CMV promoter were generous gifts of Drs. B. Lüscher and M. Austen (Institut fur Molekularbiologie, Hanover, Germany) (28Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The construct encoding the mutant E1A protein (pCMV-E1AΔ64–68) in which amino acids 64–68 have been deleted was originally described by Bannister and Kouzarides (25Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. J. Darnell, Rockefeller University, New York, NY). pCMV-CBP (29Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J.

The sources of all other reagents and plasmids have been given (2Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Luciferase reporter constructs (1 μg/plate) under the control of promoters derived from genes encoding FPP synthase (pFPPS0.319L), HMG-CoA synthase (pSYNSRE), HMG-CoA reductase (pRED), the LDL receptor (pLDLr), and an expression vector encoding β-galactosidase (pCMV-β-gal) (0.5 μg/plate) were added as indicated (12Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Additional plasmids encoding SREBP-1a (pCMV-CSA10), E1A (pCMV-E1A), mutant E1A (pCMV-E1AΔ64–68), and CBP (pCMV-CBP) were added as indicated in the figure legends. Following transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with either 10% lipoprotein-deficient calf serum in the absence (inducing medium) or presence (repressing medium) of sterols (10 μg/ml cholesterol and 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) (13Ericsson J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) or 10% fetal bovine serum, as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then lysed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined (13Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies (13Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Each experimental point was performed in duplicate (variation, <10%), and each experiment was repeated three or more times with similar results. Hek 293 cells that stably express the tetracycline-controlled transactivator (CLONTECH) were transfected with the empty pBI-L vector or pBI-L containing Gal4-CBP(1–451). Cells that stably express the latter plasmids were selected as described by the manufacturer. Cells were grown in the absence or presence of sterols and doxycycline (2 μg/ml) as described in the legend to Fig. 6. Recombinant SREBP-1a, containing amino-terminal T7 and polyhistidine (His6) tags, was purified to homogeneity fromEscherichia coli extracts by nickel affinity chromatography as described by Sanchez et al. (4Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). GST-CBP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli and crude lysates used as described. A fragment of the FPP synthase promoter containing nucleotides −293 to −233 andHindIII/BamHI flanking sequences was gel-purified and end-radiolabeled with 32P. The radiolabeled probe (4 × 106 cpm; 0.3 pmol) was incubated in the presence of 30 μl of recombinant SREBP-1a (<50 ng/μl) in 0.5 ml of Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 75 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 1% nonfat milk). GST-CBP fusion proteins were expressed and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (25 μl of crude extract/lane) and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane-bound proteins were renatured at room temperature in a buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% nonfat milk) that was changed four times. The membrane was incubated overnight in Buffer A (5 ml/membrane) containing the preformed SREBP-1a:radiolabeled DNA complex, washed twice at 4 °C in Buffer A (100 ml/membrane), and then exposed to film. Hek 293 cells that stably express the tet-controlled transcriptional activator were obtained fromCLONTECH, CA. The cells were grown in the presence of G418 (100 μg/ml), transfected with pBI-L or pBI-l-Gal4-CBP(1–451) together with pTK-Hyg (CLONTECH). Cells were selected for resistance to hygromycin (100 μg/ml) as described by the manufacturer. Hygromycin-resistant cells were frozen or incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with 10% LPDS in the absence or presence of sterols, as described above, and in the absence or presence of doxycycline (2 μg/ml) as indicated in the legend to Fig. 6. In order to begin to elucidate the mechanism involved in the transcriptional activation of sterol- and SREBP-regulated genes, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with separate plasmids containing luciferase reporter genes under the control of promoters derived from the FPP synthase (pFPPS), HMG-CoA synthase (pSYNSRE), the LDL receptor (pLDLr), and HMG-CoA reductase (pRED) genes; β-galactosidase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter; and, where indicated, plasmids encoding E1A or a mutant E1A protein (E1AΔ64–68) (Fig. 1). This mutant E1A protein is unable to bind CBP or p300 as a result of a 5-amino acid deletion (25Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated for 24 h in medium supplemented with 10% LPDS in the absence (inducing conditions) or presence (repressing conditions) of excess sterols. As expected, in the absence of E1A, the luciferase activity of each reporter gene was induced when cells were incubated in sterol-depleted medium (Fig. 1, lanes 1 versus 2). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the induction of pFPPS was attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, when cells were cotransfected with 25–100 ng of the E1A-expressing plasmid (data not shown). The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the induction of each reporter gene was attenuated in cells transiently transfected with 100 ng of plasmid encoding wild-type E1A (Fig. 1, lanes 1 versus 3). In contrast, little or no inhibition of luciferase activity was observed when cells were cotransfected with the plasmid encoding the mutant E1A protein (Fig. 1, lanes 1 versus 5). Fig. 1 also shows that the luciferase activity of each reporter gene in sterol-treated cells was low (lanes 2) and was unaffected by coexpression of either wild-type (lanes 4) or mutant E1A (lanes 6) protein. In other studies, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the FPP synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene in the absence or presence of a plasmid encoding the nuclear-targeted amino-terminal domain of SREBP-1a and plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant E1A protein. The luciferase activity of the reporter gene increased 13-fold in response to the cotransfected SREBP-1a by a process that was unaffected by coexpression of the mutant E1A protein but was attenuated following coexpression of wild-type E1A, in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). The E1A protein is multifunctional (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). One cellular role of E1A may depend on its ability to bind CBP and thus interfere with the function of this transcriptional coactivator (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the inhibitory effect of E1A on the expression of the FPP synthase promoter-reporter gene were overcome when the cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding CBP (compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). In the absence of E1A, coexpressed CBP resulted in an additional increase in luciferase activity (Fig. 2, lane 7 versus lane 1), consistent with the proposal that the amount of endogenous CBP may be inadequate for maximal transcription of the reporter gene. In contrast, the luciferase activity in cells treated with sterols was not affected significantly by cotransfected E1A or CBP (Fig. 2, compare lane 2 with lanes 4, 6, and 8). Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are consistent with the hypothesis that transcriptional activation of a number of SREBP-dependent genes requires CBP. These results also indicate that under conditions of cellular sterol excess, basal transcription of these reporter genes is independent of CBP. A far-Southwestern assay was used to determine whether recombinant GST-CBP fusion proteins could bind to a preformed SREBP-1a:[32P]DNA complex. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that an SREBP-1a:DNA complex bound to both GST-CBP(1–451) (lanes 3and 4) and GST-CBP(451–721) (lanes 5 and6) but not to GST (lanes 1 and 2), GST-CBP(721–1100) (lanes 7 and 8), or any of the other three GST-CBP fusion proteins used in these studies (data not shown). Because these studies were performed with recombinant proteins, we conclude that the interaction of SREBP with the two amino-terminal domains of CBP does not require any posttranslational modifications. A second, identical gel was stained with Coomassie Blue in order to demonstrate that the different GST-CBP fusion proteins were present at similar levels (Fig. 3 B). The results in Fig. 3 A suggest that one or more amino-terminal domains of CBP may interact with SREBP in vivo. We hypothesized that expression of this CBP domain in cells would interfere with the physiological interaction of endogenous CBP with SREBPs released into the nucleus in response to cellular sterol depletion. In order to test this hypothesis, we obtained six plasmids encoding various Gal4-CBP fusion proteins (28Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The full-length CBP protein and the fragments (amino acids 1–451, 451–721, 721–1100, 1100–1460, 1460–1891, and 1891–2441) that were used to produce these six Gal4-CBP constructs are illustrated in Fig. 4 A. Transient transfection of these plasmids into mammalian cells results in similar levels of expression of the fusion proteins (28Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In addition, as a result of a nuclear targeting domain in Gal4, the fusion proteins are localized to the nucleus (28Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the FPP synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene in the absence or presence of plasmids encoding the indicated Gal4-CBP fusion proteins. The increase in luciferase activity that occurred when cells were incubated in the absence of sterols (Fig. 4 B, lane 1 versus lane 2) was partially blocked by coexpression of Gal4-CBP(1–451) (Fig. 4 B, lane 3 versus lane 1) but not by the other Gal4-CBP fusion proteins (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13). In other experiments, transient transfection of cells with higher levels of the plasmid encoding Gal4-CBP(451–721) did result in attenuation of the induced luciferase activity (data not shown), consistent with the observation that CBP(451–721) can interact with SREBP-1a (Fig. 3). We conclude that the amino-terminal domain of CBP (amino acids 1–451) functions in a dominant negative manner and interferes with the physiological interaction between the endogenous SREBP, which is bound to the SRE-3 cis element of the FPPS promoter, and the endogenous full-length CBP. This conclusion is supported by additional studies, which demonstrated that the increase in luciferase activity in response to coexpressed SREBP-1a was inhibited 75% by Gal4-CBP(1–451) but was not affected by Gal4-CBP(721–1100) (data not shown). In contrast, none of the six Gal4-CBP fusion proteins affected the luciferase levels in sterol-treated cells, a condition where there is little or no nuclear localized SREBP (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 versus lanes 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14). Thus, transcription of the reporter gene under sterol-repressed conditions is independent of CBP. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when the experiments depicted in Fig. 4 B were repeated with either an HMG-CoA synthase promoter-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5 A) or an HMG-CoA reductase promoter-luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 5 B). In each study, the induction of the reporter gene in response to cellular sterol depletion was attenuated by Gal4-CBP(1–451), whereas other Gal4-CBP fusion proteins had little or no inhibitory effect (Fig. 5). Further support for a specific inhibitory effect of Gal4-CBP(1–451) was obtained from other studies, which demonstrated that the 15-fold increase in the expression of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter-luciferase gene in response to coexpressed SREBP-1a was inhibited 70% by Gal4-CBP(1–451) but was unaffected by Gal4-CBP(721–1100) or (1100–1460) (data not shown). None of the promoter-reporter genes used in these studies were affected when the cells were cotransfected with a plasmid that expressed the DNA binding domain of Gal4 alone (data not shown). The function of CBP in this and all other studies has been determined using either in vivo assays, in which cells are transfected with plasmids containing reporter-genes, or in vitro assays. The chromatin structure associated with transfected plasmid DNA is not well defined but is thought to differ significantly from that associated with endogenous genes. In order to more clearly define the role of CBP in regulating endogenous genes, we performed the experiments depicted in Fig. 6. Hek 293 cells, which stably express the tetracycline activator, were stably transfected with either pBI-L or pBI-l-Gal4-CBP(1–451). Cells containing the latter two plasmids are expected to express luciferase or both luciferase and Gal4-CBP(1–451), respectively, in response to added doxycycline. Addition of doxycycline to the cells resulted in an 70–80-fold increase in luciferase expression, consistent with the presence of stably transfected, transcriptionally active plasmid (data not shown). In the absence of doxycycline, the endogenous mRNA levels of FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase were regulated approximately 4-fold when the Hek 293 cells, containing either pBI-l-Gal4-CBP(1–451) or pBI-L, were incubated in the absence or presence of exogenous sterols (Fig. 6, lane 2 versus lane 1 and lane 6 versus lane 5). In control cells that contain pBI-L, the relative levels and fold regulation of these mRNAs by sterols were unaffected by doxycycline (Fig. 6, lane 8 versus lane 6 and lane 7 versus lane 5). In contrast, when cells containing pBI-l-Gal4-CBP(1–451) were incubated in sterol-depleted medium, the induction of both FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase mRNAs was prevented when doxycycline was added to the cells (Fig. 6, lane 4 versus lane 2). These results demonstrate that the induced transcription of endogenous FPP synthase and HMG-CoA synthase genes in response to sterol depletion is inhibited by Gal4-CBP(1–451). We conclude that CBP has an important physiological role in the SREBP-dependent transcriptional induction of these endogenous genes. Cellular sterol deprivation is known to activate the transcription of a number of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (e.g. HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, FPP synthase, squalene synthase, the LDL receptor, and SREBP-2) (1Brown M.S.

Transcriptional activation of these genes is dependent on the binding of SREBP and either NF-Y or Sp1 to the proximal promoters. However, the exact mechanism(s) by which SREBP and either NF-Y or Sp1 activate transcription of these genes remains to be elucidated. The current study demonstrates that in cells deprived of sterols, the elevated transcription of at least four SREBP-dependent reporter genes is dependent on an interaction between SREBP and the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–451) of CBP. The current study also utilized the doxycycline-inducible expression of a dominant negative form of CBP to clearly demonstrate the important role of CBP in the physiological regulation of endogenous SREBP-responsive genes (Fig. 6). This latter approach may prove useful in delineating the role of CBP in the physiological regulation of other genes. The stimulatory effect of coexpressed CBP on transcription of the FPP synthase promoter-reporter gene (Fig. 2) is consistent with the proposal that the endogenous levels of CBP may, under certain conditions, be a limiting factor in the expression of SREBP-regulated genes. Other investigators have reported that when cells are transiently transfected with constructs that express transcription factors that are known to interact with CBP, transcription of other CBP-dependent genes declines, presumably as a result of competition for limiting amounts of nuclear CBP (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J.

Thus, it seems likely that transcriptional activation of SREBP-dependent genes may be attenuated when other CBP-dependent signaling pathways are activated. The current study confirms and extends an earlier report by Olineret al. (27Oliner J.D. Andresen M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These authors utilized a far-Western assay to demonstrate that the amino-terminal domain of SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 bound to the amino-terminal domain (amino acids 1–682) of CBP in solution. They also demonstrated that the induced expression of an LDL receptor promoter-reporter gene that resulted from coexpression of a plasmid encoding either SREBP-1a or SREBP-2 was further enhanced 2–4-fold by coexpression of CBP (27Oliner J.D. Andresen M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). CBP is thought to function in part by forming a bridge between transcription factors and components (TFIIB and TBP) of the polII complex (19Shikama N. Lyon J. La Thangue N.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 230-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 20Eckner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 377: 685-688Google Scholar, 21Pazin M.J. Kadonaga J.T.

The dominant negative effect produced as a result of expression of Gal4-CBP(1–451) provides support for the physiological importance of the interaction of SREBP with CBP. However, interaction of CBP with TFIIB may not be required for transcription of the genes tested, because the reporter activity was unaffected by coexpression of Gal4 fusion proteins that contain carboxyl-terminal fragments of CBP known to interact with TFIIB (30Yuan W.

It is not known whether SREBP:CBP-dependent transcriptional activation is regulated by posttranslational modification of either protein, although such modifications are not necessary for protein-protein interaction in vitro (Fig. 3) (27Oliner J.D.

Further experimentation will be necessary to determine whether posttranslational modifications or additional coactivators or corepressors, such as those that have been shown to bind to nuclear hormone receptors (29Torchia J.

Under sterol-repressed conditions, the luciferase activities of all four promoter-reporter genes (HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA reductase, FPP synthase, and the LDL receptor) were not significantly affected by coexpression of E1A, CBP, or Gal4-CBP fusion proteins. In addition, the sterol-repressed mRNA levels for endogenous HMG-CoA synthase and FPP synthase were unaffected by Gal4-CBP(1–451) expression (Fig. 6). Thus, CBP appears to play no functional role in the basal (i.e. sterol-repressed) transcription of these four genes. We thank Bernard Lee for excellent technical assistance and Drs. B. Lüscher, M. Austen, C. Glass, and J. Darnell for their generosity in supplying various plasmids, as indicated in the text."

In this study, we examined the effects of these compounds on components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction cascade. Tempo treatment (15 min) of MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells resulted in significant levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of several as yet unidentified proteins compared with equimolar concentration of tempol (10 mm). Both compounds caused tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 protein kinase (30 min, 2–3-fold). Interestingly, however, only tempol caused increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 activity (2 h, ∼3-fold). On the other hand, tempo, but not tempol, potently activated stress-activated protein kinase (2 h, >3-fold). Consistent with these data, tempol was found to be noncytotoxic, whereas tempo induced apoptotic cell death (2 h, >50%). Tempo treatment also resulted in significant elevation of ceramide levels at 30 min (54% over control) and 1 h (71% over control) posttreatment, preceding stress-activated protein kinase activation and apoptosis. These data suggest that in the absence of an environmental oxidative stress, tempol and tempo elicit distinct cellular signaling pathways. The recognition of the molecular mechanisms of nitroxide action may have important implications for biological effectiveness of these compounds.

In many of these instances, free radicals and derived species play an important role in initiating a cellular signal transduction response (45Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Unlike the ERK signaling pathway, which primarily promotes growth and proliferation/survival, the SAPK and p38 MAPK pathways result in growth arrest and apoptotic or necrotic cell death. Because nitroxides protect against diverse oxidative insults and may have utility in clinical biomedical research, we have investigated the effects of tempol and tempo on MAPK signal transduction pathways in an attempt to better understand their mechanism of action. Evidence presented here demonstrates that tempol and tempo stimulate distinct pathways of the MAPK signaling cascade. Tempol stimulated the ERK activity and was noncytotoxic, whereas tempo induced ceramide generation, SAPK/JNK activation, and apoptotic death of MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells. The cytotoxic effect of tempo was also observed in two other cancer cell types, PCI-04A laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. These findings provide new insight into the mechanism of action of nitroxide antioxidants, which will be valuable in understanding their biological effectiveness. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-SAPK polyclonal antibody (α-NT), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb) (α-PY, 4G10), and agarose-conjugated α-PY (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); agarose-conjugated anti-ERK1 (C-16, sc-93ac), anti-JNK1 (C-17 sc-474ac), and anti-Raf-1 (C-12) polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Raf-1 mAb (c-Raf-1) and anti-ERK1 mAb (MK12) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, Kentucky). Protein A-agarose and Syntide-2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The nitroxide compounds tempo (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl) and tempol (4-hydroxy-tempo) were obtained from Aldrich. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) reagents and 5× TGS electrophoretic buffer (49 mm Tris, 384 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and premixed 10× Tris-glycine transfer buffer was obtained Bio-Rad. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. MDA-MB 231 human breast cancer cells were grown to near confluence in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in improved minimum essential medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mml-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2:95% air at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized and plated onto a 150-mm tissue culture dish (two dishes per flask) overnight in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cultures were maintained in serum-free medium overnight prior to tempol (10 mm) or tempo (10 mm) treatment. Both nitroxide radicals were dissolved in ethanol before use. For the extraction of whole cell lysates (WCLs), cells with or without nitroxide treatment were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.5 μm sodium orthovanadate (Na3VO4) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 1% Nonidet P-40; 10% glycerol; 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A; 1 mmNa3VO4; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 25 mm sodium fluoride (NaF); and 0.5 mm EDTA). WCLs were agitated for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Whole cell lysate (1 mg) was immunoprecipitated with the appropriate agarose-conjugated antibody (1 μg/ml of lysis buffer) overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. For SAPK immunoprecipitation, WCLs (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-SAPK antibody (5 μg/ml) overnight followed by addition of protein A-agarose (50 μl of 250 μl/ml stock) and incubation for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune-complex beads were collected by microcentrifugation at 15,000 × gfor 5 min followed by three washes with lysis buffer. The beads were resuspended in 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. The membrane was blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween (0.25%) and immunoblotted with the desired primary antibody at 1:2000, followed by 1:10,000 dilution of an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody. The immunoreactive protein bands were revealed by ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bands of interest were quantified by ImageQuant software version 3.3 (Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer, Sunnyvale, CA). Prior to reprobing, blots were stripped according to the enhanced chemiluminescence kit protocol (NEN Life Science Products), as described earlier (43Suy S. Anderson W.B. Dent P. Chang E. Kasid U.

Raf-1 protein kinase activity was measured by a kinase cascade assay according to the manufacturer's procedure (Upstate Biotechnology), with the following modifications. Briefly, Raf-1 immune-complex was washed 3 times with lysis buffer and once with kinase binding buffer (KBB). This was followed by incubation of the immune-complex for 30 min at 30 °C in reaction mixture containing 20 μl of KBB, 10 μl of 0.5 mm ATP/Mg mixture (75 mm magnesium chloride, and 500 μm ATP in KBB), 1.6 μl of inactive MAPK kinase (0.4 μg), and 4 μl of inactive MAPK (1 μg). At the end of the reaction, 8 μl of the sample mixture was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, followed by the sequential addition of 10 μl KBB, 10 μl of myelin basic protein (MBP) substrate (2 mg/ml stock), and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/μl generated by 1:10 dilution of the stock 3000 Ci/mmol (NEN Life Science Products) in ATP/Mg2+ mixture). This reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The immune-complex was then pelleted by brief centrifugation in a benchtop microcentrifuge, and 5 μl of the sample was spotted, in triplicate, onto P81 paper. The radioactive filters were transferred onto a 50-ml conical tube (20 filters per tube) and washed four times with 40 ml of 0.75% phosphoric acid (15 min each), followed by a brief acetone wash, and counted using Beckman LS 1801 scintillation counter. Additionally, the immune-complex-associated Raf-1 activity was measured using Syntide-2 as a substrate. This reaction was initiated by sequential addition of 15 μl of KBB, 10 μl of ATP/Mg2+mixture, 5 μl of Syntide-2 (5 μg), and 10 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP followed by incubation of the reaction at 30 °C for 20 min. At the end of the incubation, reaction mixture was centrifuged briefly in a benchtop microcentrifuge, and 5 μl of the supernatant was spotted in triplicate onto P81 filter paper, air dried, washed, and counted as described above. Whole cell lysates prepared as described above were immunoprecipitated (1 mg) with an agarose-conjugated anti-ERK1 antibody or an agarose-conjugated anti-JNK1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. The immune-complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in KBB as mentioned earlier. ERK or JNK activity assay was carried out according to manufacturer's procedures (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, the ERK1 immunoprecipitates were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a kinase reaction containing 10 μl of MBP as substrate (2 mg/ml stock), 10 μl of inhibitor mixture (20 μm protein kinase C inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein A inhibitor peptide, and 20 μm compound R24571), and 10 μl of magnesium-ATP mixture (1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP generated by 1:10 dilution of stock (3000 Ci/mmol) in 75 mm magnesium chloride and 500 μm cold ATP). The immune-complexes were centrifuged briefly in a benchtop centrifuge, and 5-μl aliquots of the supernatant were spotted in triplicate onto P81 filter papers. The radioactive filters were washed and counted as described above. Alternatively, to visualize the incorporation of γ-32P into MBP, the kinase reaction was stopped by addition of 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For JNK activity assay, JNK1 immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 40 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 10 μl of KBB, 20 μl of the GST-c-Jun fusion protein (0.2 μg/μl stock), and 10 μl of the diluted [γ−32P]ATP as described above. The kinase reaction was stopped with 2× electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the supernatant was electrophoresed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The radiolabeled GST-c-Jun fusion protein was detected by autoradiography. Effects of nitroxide compounds on cell viability and proliferation were determined using a cell viability detection kit (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate, WST-1) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, MDA-MB 231 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at density of 10,000 cells/well and maintained overnight in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate buffered saline and refed in serum-free medium. The following day, cells were treated for various times with tempol (10 mm) or tempo (10 mm), using six wells per treatment condition. At the end of treatment, medium containing the nitroxide compound was removed and replaced with fresh serum-free medium (100 μl), followed by addition of WST-1 (10 μl). Plates were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and analyzed atA = 450/600 using a MR 700 microplate reader. ApoAlert Annexin V apoptosis detection system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to measure the relative distribution of apoptotic and necrotic cells. Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106cells per 25-cm2 tissue culture flask in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum overnight, followed by washing twice in serum-free medium. Cells were maintained overnight in serum-free medium and exposed to tempol (10 mm) or tempo (10 mm) for various times. This was followed by rinsing twice with serum-free medium prior to trypsinization, dilution in two volumes of serum-free medium, and centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The cell pellet was washed once with PBS and resuspended in 200 μl of 1× binding buffer. The cell suspension was double-labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V (10 μl) and propidium iodide (PI) (10 μl) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unlabeled cells or untreated cells either labeled with FITC-annexin V or PI or double-labeled served as internal controls for the background signal. The intensity of the dye uptake by cells was detected using FACStarplus Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Lincoln Park, NJ), and data were analyzed using Reproman True Facts software (Seattle, Washington). Viable cells were FITC−/PI−, apoptotic cells were FITC+/PI−, and necrotic cells were FITC+/PI+. Ceramide production in MDA-MB 231 cells was determined by diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase assay according to a previously described procedure (46Haimovitz-Friedman A. Kan C.-C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 47Dressler K.A. Kolesnick R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14917-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MDA-MB 231 cells were split (1:2), and after 24 h, the cells were washed twice with PBS and serum-free medium was added, followed by incubation for additional 24 h. The cells (∼2 × 106/60-mm dish) were treated with tempo (10 mm) or tempol (10 mm) for various times. Following treatment, floating cells were collected and pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min at 1200 rpm, and attached cells were collected by scraping. Lipids were extracted from all cells (floating and attached) by incubation in 1 ml of 100% ice-cold methanol. After a partial purification with chloroform, the extracted lipid in the organic phase was dried under N2 and was treated with a mild alkaline solution (0.1 n KOH in methanol) for 1 h at 37 °C to remove glycerolphospholipids. The organic phase extract was resuspended in 20 μl of 7.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 5 mmcardiolipin, 1 mm EDTA followed by the addition of 40 μl of purified DAG kinase in DAG kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 m NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 15% glycerol). The kinase reaction was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of diluted [γ-32P]ATP (10 mm at 1,000 dpm/pmol in DAG kinase buffer) and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C. This reaction was terminated by extraction of lipids with 1 ml of CHCl3:CH3OH:HCl (100:100:1), 170 μl of buffered saline solution (135 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmCaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2), and 30 μl of 100 mm EDTA. The lower organic phase containing ceramide 1-phosphate was collected and dried under N2followed by spotting and run of 40 μl (80%) onto a thin layer chromatographic (Whatman silica gel 150A) plate and developing in chamber containing CHCl3:CH3OH:HAc (65:15:5, v/v) as solvent. The spot containing the ceramide 1-phosphate was visualized by autoradiography, and the incorporated 32P was removed by scraping and quantified by Cerenkov counting. A standard curve consisting of a known amount of ceramide was used as a comparison to the level of observed ceramide generated in MDA-MB 231 cells. Fig. 2 illustrates a conspicuous increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of several as yet unidentified protein bands within 15 min after the exposure of MDA-MB 231 cells to 10 mm tempo. These levels remained elevated for the duration of the study (2 h). In parallel experiments, minimal protein tyrosine phosphorylation was observed at various times (15 min to 2 h) following the treatment of cells with an equimolar concentration of tempol. These data show that although both nitroxides induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation, the magnitude of this response was clearly higher in tempo-treated cells. Previously, we demonstrated that ionizing radiation, a well known stress-inducing agent, causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1 in MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells (43Suy S. Anderson W.B. Dent P. Chang E. Kasid U. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we examined the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Raf-1 protein kinase in response to tempol and tempo. Interestingly, both tempol and tempo treatments led to an increase in the level of tyrosine phosphorylated Raf-1 (RafP) (Fig. 3 A, top panel). The level of total Raf-1 protein remained unchanged (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). The immunoreactive RafP bands were quantified. Densitometric analysis indicated that increase in the level of RafP detected at 15 min was ∼5–8-fold, and RafP content was comparable to the basal level by ∼60–120 min (data not shown). The activity of Raf-1 protein kinase was determined by a kinase cascade assay or by the Syntide-2 phosphorylation assay (Fig. 3 B). In agreement with the enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, tempol or tempo treatment resulted in ∼2–3-fold increase in the Raf-1 protein kinase activity. Because Raf-1 activation generally leads to ERK (p42/44 MAPK) activation, we examined the effects of tempol and tempo on ERK1 enzymatic activity. Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 4. An approximately 3-fold increase in the enzymatic activity of ERK1 was detected by 2 h in cells treated with tempol (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, however, no change in ERK1 activity was noted following tempo treatment compared with control cells (Fig. 4 A). In addition, ERK1 phosphorylation was seen as a shift to a more slowly migrating phosphorylated form (ERK1P) on immunoblots using ERK1 immunoprecipitates at 2 h after tempol exposure (10 mm), but we were unable to identify a shift in the mobility of ERK1 in tempo-treated cells (data not shown). We next measured the effects of tempol and tempo on SAPK/JNK, a well-known component of the stress-induced signal transduction pathway. The time course experiments indicated that tempo treatment resulted in a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated SAPK (∼54 kDa, SAPKP) compared with tempol treatment or untreated controls (Fig. 5,A and B). Consistent with these data, SAPK enzymatic activity was significantly induced in tempo-treated cells as shown by the level of phosphorylated GST-c-Jun (Fig. 5 C). Densitometric analysis of three independently performed experiments indicated a 3–7-fold increase in the phosphorylated GST-c-Jun fusion protein detectable after tempo exposure (10 mm, 2 h) compared with tempol (10 mm, 2 h) or control (1% ethanol, 2 h) treatment. Several studies have reported that activation of the SAPK signaling cascade is associated with induction of apoptotic cell death (32Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). To examine the possible cytotoxic effects of tempo, we first used a colorimetric assay to determine the cell viability and proliferation. Treatment of cells with 10 mm tempo resulted in >50% decrease in the number of viable cells within 2 h. In parallel e"

Subcloning of thedrrAB genes in Escherichia coli has previously been shown to result in expression of DrrA and DrrB proteins and resistance to doxorubicin in a sensitive strain of E. coli. DrrA, a peripheral membrane protein, binds ATP in a UV-catalyzed reaction in a doxorubicin-dependent manner; DrrB, a hydrophobic protein, is localized to the inner membrane of E. coli (Kaur, P. (1997) J. Bacteriol. 179, 569–575). The present study provides evidence that DrrB, the membrane component of the complex, is stably maintained in the cell only if DrrA is present. Furthermore, it was found that the catalytic component DrrA is in an active conformation only when it is in a complex with DrrB. In a subclone containing the drrB gene by itself, no DrrB protein could be detected, although a translational fusion of the first 15 amino acids of DrrB to β-galactosidase indicated that DrrB is translated in the absence of DrrA. Upon co-transformation with a plasmid containing the drrA gene in trans, DrrB could again be detected in these cells. UV cross-linking studies with [α-32P]ATP showed that only the membrane-bound form of DrrA in cells containing both DrrA and DrrB was in a conformation competent to bind ATP. Chemical cross-linking studies also provided direct evidence for interaction between the two proteins. Based on these analyses, a model for interaction between DrrA and DrrB proteins is presented.

Doxorubicin and daunorubicin, two antibiotics produced byStreptomyces peucetius, are widely used in chemotherapy.S. peucetius is itself resistant to the inhibitory action of these drugs. Resistance in S. peucetius is encoded by thedrr operon that contains two open reading frames,drrA and drrB (1Guilfoile P.G. Hutchinson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8553-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). DrrA and DrrB proteins have been hypothesized to form an efflux pump that confers resistance by transport of the drugs out of the cell (1Guilfoile P.G. Hutchinson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8553-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DrrA protein consists of one nucleotide binding domain with homology to the ABC family of proteins to which P-glycoprotein (Pgp 1The abbreviations used are: Pgp, P-glycoprotein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate). ; Ref. 3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar) belongs. The product of the drrB gene is a membrane protein (1Guilfoile P.G. Hutchinson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8553-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with homology to membrane components of the bacterial ABC transporters (4Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1326-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Pgp is expressed in human cancer cell lines, where it confers resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs, including doxorubicin and daunorubicin (3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). This phenomenon is referred to as multidrug resistance. Pgp contains a drug-stimulated ATPase activity (5Senior A.E. Al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1995; 27: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); however, its mode of action and the mechanism by which it can transport structurally unrelated substrates is not understood. Since DrrA and Pgp are homologous proteins and both confer resistance to doxorubicin and daunorubicin, an understanding of the structure and function of Drr pump is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the function and evolution of Pgp. The drr operon has previously been subcloned in anEscherichia coli expression vector, and both proteins have been identified using antisera raised in rabbits (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the proteins in an acr strain of E. coli resulted in doxorubicin resistance in these cells, indicating that the proteins expressed in E. coli retain proper conformation and function. Isolation of active alkaline phosphatase fusions in DrrB showed that DrrB is an integral membrane protein (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DrrA, a peripheral membrane protein was shown to bind ATP or GTP in the presence of Mg2+. The nucleotide binding to DrrA was found to be doxorubicin-dependent (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the activity of DrrA is regulated by the substrate of the pump. Most ABC transporters, including Pgp, consist of two nucleotide binding domains and two membrane-spanning domains of six α-helices each. In Pgp, the four domains form one large protein of about 170 kDa (3Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3562) Google Scholar). The Drr system, instead, consists of two subunits, DrrA and DrrB, that carry individual domains. Together, a monomer of DrrA and a monomer of DrrB form a molecule about half the size of Pgp; however, the stoichiometry of the DrrA and DrrB proteins in the Drr pump is not known. The present study focuses on an interaction between DrrA and DrrB; the data indicate a strong dependence of the proteins on each other for their expression and function such that the two protein subunits behave as domains of a larger protein. The DrrB protein was detected in the cell membrane of these cells only if there was simultaneous expression of DrrA. In addition, DrrA was in an active conformation to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP only if it was in a complex with DrrB in the membrane. Chemical cross-linking studies also suggest a direct interaction between DrrA and DrrB with the suggested stoichiometry of the complex being DrrA2B2. These results bear important implications for the evolution of multidomain proteins, including Pgp, and for understanding the interaction between their domains.

Open table in a new tab The cells were grown in LB medium (6Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) at 37 °C. Chloramphenicol was added to 20 μg/ml, and ampicillin was added to 100 μg/ml. The conditions for plasmid isolation, DNA endonuclease restriction analysis, ligation, and sequencing have been described elsewhere (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The 1.0-kilobase pairNdeI–HindIII fragment from pDX102 was subcloned behind the lac promoter in pUC18 vector by substitution of the arsA gene in pUC18arsA. This clone has been designated pDX108. The drrA gene in this construct utilizes the translational start signals of the arsA gene. A translational fusion of the first 15 amino acids of DrrB to the 8th amino acid of β-galactosidase was created. Using pDX101 or pDX103 as the template (Fig. 1 and Table I), the region contained between the lac promoter and the 45th nucleotide of the drrB gene was polymerase chain reaction-amplified. Polymerase chain reaction primers had the following nucleotide sequence, and each primer contained the following HindIII restriction site: I, 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTCCTCTCCCCGCGCGTTGG-3′; II, 5′-GCCGCCAAGCTTCGCTCACAGGGGTCGTGG-3′. The amplified product was ligated to the translational fusion vector pMC1069 that had been digested withHindIII. Amplification and subcloning of the fragment from pDX101 and pDX103 resulted in plasmids pDX109 and pDX110, respectively. pDX109 contains plac and the ribosome binding site ofarsA, followed by the drrA gene translationally coupled to drrB-lacZ fusion, as is seen in the original operon. The drrA gene, however, is missing from pDX110. CC118 cells containing pDX109 or pDX110 were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 1 mm IPTG for 3 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove unbroken cells. 100 μg of protein was then added to a tube containing 0.5 ml of Z buffer containing 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 200 μl of o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside, and the reaction was continued for 5 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.5 ml of 1 mNaCO3. β-Galactosidase units were calculated as described (6Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). E. coli TG1 cells containing the indicated plasmids were grown to mid-log phase and induced with 0.25 mm IPTG. Growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were spun down and lysed by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 20,000 p.s.i. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove the unbroken cells. The supernatant fluids were used to prepare the fractions as described earlier (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were solubilized in 4× Laemmli sample buffer by heating at 55 °C for 10 min. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blotting as described earlier (1Guilfoile P.G. Hutchinson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8553-8557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Quantitation of protein bands on the Western blots was carried out by using the Protein and DNA Imageware densitometric package. 300 μg of membrane protein was mixed with the indicated concentrations of urea (pH 8.0) in 1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The membranes were separated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The samples were solubilized by heating at 55 °C for 10 min. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blotting as described above. Photolabeling of [α-32P]ATP to the DrrA protein was carried out by the procedure described earlier (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Yue V.T. Schimmel P.R. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4678-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Photolabeling was performed in the cytosolic and membrane fractions prepared from cells expressing DrrA or both DrrA and DrrB proteins. The fractions were used directly in photolabeling experiments at the indicated protein concentrations. Doxorubicin was added to the reactions where indicated. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mg/ml cell membrane protein in a buffer (100 μl) containing 20 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5. DSP or DTSSP was added at the indicated concentrations, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The reactions were quenched by the addition of a solution of 1 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 50 mm, followed by an incubation at room temperature for 15 min. 4× Laemmli sample buffer (9Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar) prepared without the reducing agent was added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-DrrA or anti-DrrB antibodies (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To carry out two-dimensional analysis of the cross-linked species, a lane from the nonreducing gel was excised and soaked in the 4× Laemmli sample buffer containing 20% β-mercaptoethanol for 20 min at room temperature. The proteins were analyzed by placing the excised lane on top of an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The Western blots were probed with antiserum to DrrB, followed by probing with antiserum to DrrA. Expression of the DrrA or DrrB Protein—Both DrrA and DrrB proteins have previously been shown to be expressed in E. coli upon induction from the lac promoter in pDX101 (Table I). In the present study, expression of DrrA or DrrB alone was examined in pDX102 and pDX103, which contain the drrA and drrB gene, respectively. A schematic representation of these clones is given in Fig. 1 A. The genes cloned in pDX101, -102, or -103 utilize the lac promoter and the translational start signals of the arsA gene. pDX101 also contains a putative ribosome binding site (RBS) for drrB, which is contained within the coding sequence of drrA. In addition, the region between drrA and drrB (shown as ATGA in Fig. 1 A) shows translational coupling such that the stop codon of drrA overlaps with the start codon ofdrrB. Translational coupling is absent in pDX103.drrB in pDX103 lacks its own putative RBS, and it utilizes the RBS of arsA. E. coli TG1 cells containing the indicated plasmids were induced with IPTG, and samples were collected after 3 h of induction. The cells were fractionated into cytosolic and total membrane fractions. The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-DrrA or anti-DrrB serum (Fig. 1 B), and the intensities of the bands were determined by densitometric analysis. Western blot analysis using anti-DrrA serum suggested that DrrA is expressed both in pDX101- and pDx102-containing cells; however, the level of expression in pDX102 (Fig. 1 B, a,lanes 1 and 2) was lower than in pDX101 (Fig. 1 B, a, lanes 3and 4). Densitometric analysis suggested that the total level of DrrA in pDX102 was about 70% that of in pDX101. However, in both situations, i.e. in the presence or the absence of DrrB, roughly 60% DrrA was membrane-associated. A band of faster mobility than DrrA that reacts with anti-DrrA antibody (Fig. 1 B, a) is unrelated to DrrA, since this band is also observed in the control samples that do not contain either DrrA or DrrB (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by Western blotting using anti-DrrB serum suggested that DrrB is present only in pDX101-containing cells (Fig. 1 B,b, lanes 3 and 4). Little if any DrrB could be detected in the membrane fraction prepared from cells containing pDX103 (Fig. 1 B, b,lanes 1 and 2). To determine if the expression of DrrB in pDX101 is the result of translational coupling with DrrA and the absence of DrrB in pDX103 is a result of the absence thereof, a translational fusion of the first 15 amino acids of DrrB with β-galactosidase was created. Using pDX101 or pDX103 as a template, the region starting at the promoter plac and ending with the 45th nucleotide of drrB was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and the amplified fragment was fused to the eighth codon of β-galactosidase. Two clones resulting from this (Fig. 2), one (pDX109) containing thedrrA gene in cis and the other without (pDX110), were tested for β-galactosidase activity. The data in Fig. 2 indicate that drrB in pDX110 can be translated, although the β-galactosidase activity in pDX109, where drrA is present in cis, was about 2-fold higher as compared with pDX110. Since DrrB is translated in the absence of coupled translation with DrrA, but not detected in these cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1), we wanted to determine if maintenance of DrrB in the cell depends on simultaneous expression of DrrA. E. coli TG1 cells containing pDX103 were co-transformed with a compatible plasmid pDX108 containing the drrA gene. pDX108 contains thedrrA gene in pUC18 and, as in pDX101–pDX103, uses the translational start signals of arsA (Table I and Fig. 1). After induction of the drrA and drrB genes with IPTG, total cell lysates were analyzed for the presence of DrrA and DrrB proteins. Data in Fig. 3 show that the expression of DrrB from pDX103 is restored in cells containing DrrA in trans. The amount of DrrB protein detected was roughly the same whether the drrA gene was present in cis(pDX101-containing cells; lane 4) or intrans (pDX103 and pDX108; lane 5), indicating that the presence of the DrrA protein is required for maintenance of DrrB in the cell. As is also seen in Fig. 1, the level of DrrA in pDX102-containing cells was lower (Fig. 3, lane 2) as compared with pDX101-containing cells (Fig. 3,lane 4). However, expression of DrrA in pDX108 (lane 1) results in the same level of DrrA protein as in pDX101 (Fig. 3, lane 4). This may be due to the the higher copy number of plasmid pUC18 in pDX108 compared with the plasmid pSU2718 in pDX102. The band at around 29 kDa is the protein reacting nonspecifically with the anti-DrrA antibody, and it is present in all of the samples. The chemical nature of the association of DrrA or DrrB to the cell membrane was evaluated by extraction with urea (Fig. 4). About 90% DrrA was still membrane-associated after treatment with 1.5 m urea in both DrrA- and DrrAB-containing membranes (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5), whereas it could be completely extracted by 6 m urea in both cases (lanes 3 and 6). DrrB was not affected at all by 6m urea treatment (Fig. 4), confirming the earlier observation that DrrB is an integral membrane protein, whereas DrrA is peripherally associated with the membrane in both DrrA- or DrrAB-containing cells. It has previously been shown that DrrA can form a UV-activated adduct with ATP or GTP in a doxorubicin-dependent manner in total cell lysates containing both DrrA and DrrB (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if DrrB affects ATP binding to DrrA, ATP binding was characterized in the cytosolic and membrane fractions prepared from E. coli cells containing pDX101 or pDX102. [α-32P]ATP binding in a UV-catalyzed cross-linking experiment showed that DrrA cross-links to ATP only in membranes prepared from cells containing both DrrA and DrrB (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3 and 4). No ATP cross-linking was seen to DrrA in membranes containing DrrA alone (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 2). Western blot analysis of a similar gel using antibodies to DrrA or DrrB showed that DrrA was present in all samples (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–4), whereas DrrB was present only in lanes 3 and 4 (Fig. 5 C). Further, it was tested whether the soluble fraction of DrrA in cells containing both DrrA and DrrB can be UV-cross-linked to ATP. Data in Fig. 5 A, lanes 5 and 7, show that the soluble fraction of DrrA in DrrAB-containing cells was also not in a state competent to cross-link to ATP. Only the membrane bound form of DrrA in DrrAB-containing cells was competent (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6 and 8). Again, Western blot analysis showed that DrrA was present in both the cytosolic and the membrane fractions (Fig. 5 B,lanes 5–8), whereas DrrB was present only in the membrane fractions (Fig. 5 C, lanes 6and 8). Two other species in the membrane-containing samples, that move with slower mobility compared with DrrA, were also seen to form a UV-activated adduct with ATP (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1–4, 6, and 8). Both of these species are unrelated to DrrA and bind ATP irrespective of the presence or absence of DrrB. Chemical cross-linking was carried out in the cell membranes prepared from DrrAB-containing cells. Two different types of cross-linkers were used: the membrane-impermeable cross-linker DTSSP and the membrane-permeable cross-linker DSP. Both DTSSP and DSP can be cleaved in the presence of the reducing agents. Concentrations of the cross-linkers ranging from 50 to 1000 μm were used to determine interaction between DrrA and DrrB. Cross-linking patterns observed with both the cross-linkers were similar (Fig. 6). Upon analysis of the cross-linked membranes under nonreducing gel conditions and Western blot analysis using anti-DrrB antibodies, two cross-linked species were identified (Fig. 6 A). Uncross-linked DrrB, a 30.6-kDa protein, migrated at around 25 kDa as has also been reported earlier (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass of one cross-linked species was about 60 kDa (marked with anasterisk). Another cross-linked species of about 120 kDa was also observed (marked with a double asterisk). 60-kDa cross-linked species could be detected at concentrations of both cross-linkers as low as as 50 μm (Fig. 6 A,lanes 2 and 9), whereas the 120-kDa species became evident at about 100 μm (lanes 3 and 10). Another species with a mass higher than 200 kDa was also observed (marked with a triple asterisk). This high molecular weight species was more evident at concentrations of the cross-linkers higher than 250 μm (lanes 5–7 and10–13), and it became the major species at 1 mmof DSP (lane 13) and about 5 mm of DTSSP (lane 7). The cross-linked species were not observed when control membranes, prepared from cells containing just the vector, were treated with the same chemical cross-linkers (data not shown). Upon analysis of a similar gel with anti-DrrA antibodies, the uncross-linked DrrA was seen to migrate at about 36 kDa as expected (Fig. 6 B). The 60-kDa cross-linked species, seen in Fig. 6 A with anti-DrrB antibody, could be clearly seen to cross-react with the anti-DrrA antibody (Fig. 6 B, marked with an asterisk), indicating that this species is a complex containing both DrrA and DrrB. The reaction of the 120-kDa species with the Anti-DrrA antibody was less clear in the first dimension nonreducing gel shown in Fig. 6 B. Since DTSSP and DSP are cleavable cross-linkers, two-dimensional analysis of the cross-linked samples under reducing and nonreducing conditions was carried out to further characterize the presence of DrrA and DrrB in these species (Fig. 7). An entire lane corresponding to the sample in lane 11 in Fig. 6 was excised and, after incubation in the presence of the reducing agent as described under “Experimental Procedures,” was placed on top of another SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Under nonreducing conditions on a two-dimensional gel, the proteins migrate on the diagnol. Upon reduction, the cross-linked species fall off the diagnol, whereas the uncross-linked proteins stay on the diagnol. In Fig. 7, panels A and B show Western blots probed with anti-DrrB antibodies. The gel in panel A is the two-dimensional analysis of the unreduced sample, while the sample in panel B has been reduced.Panels C and D in Fig. 7 are the Western blots in panel A and B, respectively, that have been probed further with anti-DrrA antibodies. Four major spots are seen on the diagnol in A. These spots correspond to the uncross-linked DrrB and the three cross-linked moieties described earlier in Fig. 6. These are again marked with anasterisk (60 kDa), double asterisk(120 kDa), and triple asterisk (the high molecular mass moiety). Probing the same blot with anti-DrrA inC shows an additional spot corresponding to the uncross-linked DrrA. Upon reduction of the proteins, followed by two-dimensional analysis and probing with anti-DrrB, uncross-linked DrrB remained on the diagnol (Fig. 6 B). Each of the three cross-linked species was reduced to give a species that migrated with the same mobility as DrrB. To determine if the reduction of these species also resulted in DrrA, the blot in B was probed further with anti-DrrA antibody. The data shown in Dindicate that the uncross-linked DrrA stayed on the diagnol; however, reduction of each cross-linked species also generated DrrA in addition to generating DrrB as seen in B.Figure 7Two-dimensional analysis of the chemically cross-linked species. Lane 11 from the gel in Fig. 5 was excised, and the cross-linked species were reduced by incubation with β-mercaptoethanol. The excised lane was placed on top of a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel and subjected to electrophoresis, followed by sequential Western blot analysis with anti-DrrB and anti-DrrA antibodies.

In cells containing the plasmid pDX101, which contains drrA and drrB genes in cis, both DrrA and DrrB proteins were detected. Upon subcloning of thedrrA gene separately in pDX102, DrrA was detected but at levels lower than in pDX101, indicating that DrrB might affect the expression or stability of DrrA. Effect of DrrA on DrrB expression or stability, however, was much more dramatic. Subcloning of thedrrB gene alone in pDX103 showed the absence of DrrB protein (Fig. 1). Since pDX101, -102, and -103 all contain the same promoter, the regulation of expression of drrB appears to be at the level of translation or post-translational. DrrA anddrrB in the original operon are translationally coupled so that the stop codon of drrA overlaps with the start codon ofdrrB (Fig. 1). To determine if coupling is essential for expression of drrB, a translational fusion containing first 15 amino acids of DrrB fused to the eighth codon of β-galactosidase was created. Analysis of the fusion indicated that DrrB is translated in the absence of DrrA in pDX110 although at levels lower than in pDX109 that contains DrrA in cis (Fig. 2). Hence, translational coupling does not seem to be essential for translation of DrrB, although it appears to have some role in increasing efficiency of translation of DrrB in pDX109. Further experiments showed that the simultaneous expression of DrrA, whether from a gene in cisor in trans, was crucial for stable maintenance of DrrB in the cell. When drrA and drrB genes were co-transformed into the same cell on compatible plasmids, DrrB protein, translated from pDX103, was again detected at the same levels as in pDX101 (Fig. 3), implying that the regulation is mostly post-translational. To understand the contribution of translational coupling in pDX101 and pDX109 toward increased translation of DrrB, it is important to understand the role of the putative RBS ofdrrB. This is presently under investigation; however, it is clear that drrB is translated in pDX103, but the protein is not detected in these cells by Western blot analysis. When thedrrA gene is co-transformed into these cells, DrrB is again detected at the same levels as in pDX101. Hence, there appears to be a default mechanism by which DrrB is degraded in case DrrA is not present. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of DrrB by itself as a translational fusion to ArsD results in inhibition of cell growth within a few minutes of its induction (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This could be due to a leaky membrane resulting from a constitutively open channel formed by DrrB in the absence of DrrA, which might explain the need for a default mechanism to degrade DrrB, thus preventing its accumulation. Experiments are currently under way to determine the mechanism by which DrrA affects DrrB levels in the cell. Since we found strong evidence for a very specific interaction between DrrA and DrrB, chemical cross-linking studies were carried out to characterize the interaction further and to determine the stoichiometry of the complex in the membrane. Studies carried out with both a membrane-permeable and a membrane-impermeable cleavable cross-linker showed the presence of two cross-linked species: one species of 60 kDa and another species of 120 kDa. Both species were shown by two-dimensional analysis, after reduction, to consist of both DrrA and DrrB. DrrA migrates as a 36-kDa protein, and DrrB, a 30.6-kDa protein, migrates at roughly 25 kDa; hence, the 60-kDa cross-linked species should correspond to a complex consisting of one subunit of DrrA and one subunit of DrrB, whereas the 120-kDa species probably consists of a complex of two subunits of DrrA and two subunits of DrrB. A cross-linked species with a mass greater than 200 kDa, possibly representing a nonspecific aggregate containing DrrA, DrrB, and other membrane proteins, was also observed; the amount of this species was seen to increase at higher concentrations of the cross-linker until it became the major species at 1 mm. Hence, the formation of the 60-kDa chemically cross-linked species suggests a strong interaction between DrrA and DrrB. Based on the available data, it can also be speculated that the DrrAB complex consists of two subunits of DrrA and two of DrrB. The failure to detect species corresponding to (A)2 or (B)2 might imply that in the Drr complex, DrrA only contacts DrrB and not another subunit of DrrA and that the complex has the arrangement of A1B1A2B2(Fig. 8), where the superscripts 1 or 2 indicate subunit 1 or subunit 2 within the complex. This would make the DrrAB pump equivalent to Pgp in terms of the number of domains and the overall structure, both containing two nucleotide-binding ABC cassettes and two membrane-spanning domains. The 60-kDa cross-linked species indicates that the closest interaction is between A1 and B1 or between A2 and B2. Within the arrangement A1B1A2B2, the species A1B1A2 and B1A2B2 would also be expected upon cross-linking, but these species were not detected, perhaps because a cross-link between B1 and A2 results in the 120-kDa species A1B1A2B2 instead of A1B1A2 or B1A2B2 due to the close proximity of A1 and B1 or A2 and B2. Interaction between subunits of transport complexes has been reported (10Hwang J. Zhong X. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6264-6270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, such a tight regulation of expression and function as seen in the DrrAB system has not been observed before. It has generally been observed that the prokaryotic transport systems exist as complexes consisting of subunits that are encoded by genes within an operon, whereas the eukaryotic transporters occur as single large proteins that contain multiple domains. DrrAB, a typical prokaryotic transporter, consists of two separately expressed subunits; however, the subunits are tightly coupled and appear to behave like the domains of a single protein. In addition to DrrA regulating the stability or membrane insertion of DrrB, the function of DrrA itself was found to be dependent upon its interaction with DrrB. DrrA has previously been shown to be an ATP/GTP-binding protein (2Kaur P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that no ATP cross-linking to DrrA was seen in the cytoplasmic or membrane-bound form of DrrA in cells containing only DrrA. Further, ATP cross-linking to DrrA was seen only in the membrane-bound fraction of DrrA in DrrAB-containing cells (Fig. 5). These data suggest that it is the specific interaction between DrrA and DrrB in the membrane that introduces a conformational change in the ATP binding site of DrrA. Hence, although DrrA is tightly associated with the membrane in the absence of DrrB (Fig. 4), it is not in an active conformation. Hence, the ability of DrrB to be stably maintained in the cell and/or inserted into the membrane depends on DrrA, and the ability of DrrA to bind and/or hydrolyze ATP depends on the presence of DrrB in the membrane. In this respect, the DrrAB complex is a novel ABC transporter, where two components assist each other in a stepwise manner. Based on the data presented in this paper, we propose that DrrA is an allosteric protein that goes through different conformations depending on the presence or absence of DrrB and the ligand doxorubicin (Fig. 8). The DrrB protein is shown as consisting of seven transmembrane α-helices based on preliminary analysis of gene fusions with alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase. 2P. Kaur and J. Levine, unpublished data. In its uncomplexed state, DrrA is in conformation I, which is inactive in terms of its ability to UV-cross-link with ATP. Interaction with DrrB results in maintenance of DrrB in the cell membrane, and this interaction introduces a conformational change in the active site of DrrA, which is shown as conformation II. Active conformation of DrrA, depicted as conformation III, can be achieved via conformation II upon the addition of doxorubicin. It is in this conformation that DrrA is able to form the UV-activated cross-link with ATP (Figs. 2 and 5). A better understanding of how DrrA and DrrB interact would undoubtedly lead to a better understanding of how domains within Pgp might interact and stabilize each other and how energy might be transduced between the catalytic ABC domain and the membrane-spanning domain of Pgp. This has implications for understanding the evolution of multidomain proteins found primarily in eukaryotic cells. Thanks are due to P. C. Tai for helpful discussions during preparation of the manuscript."

We find that a chimera, containing the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP fused to transmembrane and extracellular domains of the transferrin receptor, is slowly recycled and rapidly internalized in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Morphological studies indicate that the chimera is slowly trafficked through the general endosomal recycling compartment rather than being sorted to a specialized recycling pathway. A chimera in which a di-leucine sequence within the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP has been mutated to alanines is rapidly internalized and rapidly recycled, indicating that this di-leucine is required for the slow recycling but not for the rapid internalization. Insulin stimulates a 2–3-fold increase in the recycling of the chimera and only a 1.2-fold increase in the recycling of the transferrin receptor. The effect of insulin on the recycling of the chimera is blocked by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitor. GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) increases the recycling of the chimera by 50% but has no effect on the recycling of the transferrin receptor.

GLUT4 is a glucose transporter isoform predominantly expressed in fat and muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 1James D.E. Piper R.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 126: 1123-1126Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the absence of insulin, ∼90% of GLUT4 is localized to intracellular compartments. Exposure of fat and muscle cells to insulin stimulates a translocation of GLUT4-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane, shifting the distribution to a new steady state in which 50% of GLUT4 is on the cell surface. In both the basal and insulin-stimulated states GLUT4 is continually internalized and recycled back to the cell surface (2Jhun B. Rampla A. Lui H. Lachaal M. Jung C. J. Biol.

The internalization and recycling of the transferrin receptor (TR) 1The abbreviations used are: TR, transferrin receptor; Tf, transferrin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TGN, trans-Golgi network; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; SM, sphingomyelin; TM, transmembrane; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. has been extensively characterized. Briefly, TR binds diferric transferrin (Tf) and is rapidly internalized through clathrin-coated pits into acidic endosomes. At the acidic intralumenal pH of endosomes, Fe is released from Tf and the iron-free Tf remains bound to its receptor (20Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). The Tf·TR complex is returned to the plasma membrane, and Tf is released from the TR at the neutral extracellular pH. We and others have used TR chimeras as reporter molecules to study endocytic trafficking (see,e.g., Refs. 21Garippa R.J. Judge T. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar and 22Odorizzi J.F. Trowbridge I.S. Xue L. Hopkins C.R. Davis C.D. Collawn J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 707-715Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Advantages of using the TR for these studies are that substitution of cytoplasmic domains for the cytoplasmic domain of the TR does not affect the binding of Tf to the TR, and therefore Tf can be used in biochemical and microscopy studies to characterize the internalization, intracellular trafficking, and recycling back to the cell surface of the chimeras. The only known endocytic trafficking motif of the TR is a cytoplasmic YTRF internalization motif (23Collawn J.F. Stangel M. Kuhn L.A. Esekogwu V. Jing S. Trowbridge I.S. Trainer J.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Unlike internalization, efficient recycling back to the plasma membrane does not require a specific recycling motif (24Jing S. Spencer T. Miller K. Hopkins C. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 25Johnson L.S. Presley J.F. Park J.C McGraw T.E. J. Cell.

Consequently, the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the TR do not contribute to the trafficking characteristics of chimeras containing these domains. In this report, we characterize the behavior of chimeras between IRAP and the human TR. In one chimera, vp·TR, the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP was substituted for the single amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the TR, and in the other, vpTM·TR, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of IRAP were fused to the extracellular domain of the TR. Both chimeras are recycled at about one-third the rate of the wild type TR and internalized at the same rate as the TR. These data demonstrate that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP contains information that promotes rapid internalization and slow recycling. Morphological studies indicate that the vp·TR is slowly trafficked through the general endosomal recycling compartments rather than being sorted to a specialized recycling pathway. The slow recycling of vp·TR is dependent on a di-leucine sequence located at position 76 in the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP because a mutant in which alanines have been substituted for these leucines is recycled at the same rate as wild type TR. Insulin stimulates the recycling of vp·TR by 2–3-fold and causes a much smaller increase, 1.2-fold, in the recycling rate of the wild type TR. The effect of insulin on the recycling of the chimera is blocked by wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase inhibitor. GTPγS increases the recycling of the chimera but has no effect on the recycling of the TR. We conclude that CHO cells possess a specialized, slow recycling mechanism that is regulated by insulin. TRVb, a CHO cell line that does not express functional endogenous TR, was used for transfection studies (27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with the vp·TR chimera using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacture's recommendations. The G418 resistance plasmid, pSV3Neo, was co-transfected as a selectable marker. Cells were selected in 1 mg/ml G418, and individual colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders. The isolation and characterization of TRVb cells expressing the wild type human TR and the Δ3–59 TR deletion construct have been described (27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 28Pytowski B. Judge T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol.

Cells were grown in either Ham's F-12 medium or McCoy's 5A medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 220 mm sodium bicarbonate (Sigma). Human Tf was obtained from Sigma and further purified by Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration. Diferric Tf,125I-Tf, and 55FeCl3 were prepared as described previously (21Garippa R.J. Judge T. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 125I and55Fe2 were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Tf was labeled with the fluorescent dye Cy3 (Biological Detection Systems, Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) or Life Technologies, Inc. cDNAs of IRAP (16Keller S.R. Scott H.M. Mastick C.C. Aebersold R. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 270: 23612-23618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and the human TR cloned into pUC8 vector (27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were used as templates. The overlapping oligonucleotide PCR scheme previously used to create chimeras in which heterologous cytoplasmic domains were substituted for the TR cytoplasmic domains was used to create the vp·TR chimera (21Garippa R.J. Judge T. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides bridging the cytoplasmic domain sequences of IRAP and the transmembrane sequences of the TR were: 5′-CCAGATGAGAATGACAAAAGGTGTAGTGGAAG and its complement. The underlined nucleotides are the membrane proximal cytoplasmic sequences of the IRAP, and the remainder are from the transmembrane domain of the human TR. The oligonucleotides used to fuse the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of IRAP to the extracellular domain of the TR were: 5′-TATCTACTGAAAGGGGTAC and 5′- CTACCCCTTTCAGTAGATAAATC. The underlined sequences are from IRAP. The oligonucleotides used to mutate the double leucines at positions 53 and 54 were: 5′-TCGAGGGCAGCAGTGAGAGGTGTTGGTG and its complement. The underlined nucleotides are the mutated codons. The oligonucleotides used to mutate the double leucines at positions 76 and 77 were: 5′-CTGCCAAGGCAGCAGGCATGTCCTTC and its complement. The underlined nucleotides are the mutated codons. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the PCR-generated products were sequenced by the Rockefeller University sequencing facility. For each assay, cells were grown in either six-well or 24-well clusters. Nonspecific binding of Tf was determined in duplicate for each data point by including a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Tf in the incubation medium. All data have been corrected for nonspecific binding, which was typically less than 10% of the total. The buffer used for experimental incubations was McCoy's 5A medium, 220 mm sodium bicarbonate, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4 (medium 1). The neutral wash buffer was 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4 (medium 2). All incubations at 37 °C were performed in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The kinetic assays used to characterize the rates of internalization, recycling, steady-state surface-to-internal distribution, and iron accumulation have been described in detail elsewhere (29Johnson L.S. Dunn K.W. Pytowski B. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1251-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 30Garippa R. Johnson A. Park J. Petrush R.L. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20660-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The amount of chimera on the surface was determined using a previously described assay (30Garippa R. Johnson A. Park J. Petrush R.L. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20660-20668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 1 h in medium 1 at 37 °C, followed by an incubation in medium 1 with 3 μg/ml iodinated Tf at 37 °C for varying times (2–8 min). The cells were placed on ice, washed, and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5 m glacial acetic acid, pH 3.0. The cells were then washed with medium 2 (4 °C), solubilized and the radioactivity measured. This value represents the Tf internalized during the incubation at 37 °C. The steady-state amount of Tf bound to the cell surface is determined in parallel dishes by incubating cells with iodinated Tf for 2 h at 4 °C. The slope of a plot of the ratio of internal Tf to surface Tf versus time is the internalization rate constant. Cells were incubated in medium 1 for 1 h at 37 °C, and then incubated in 3 μg/ml55Fe2 Tf at 37 °C. At the times indicated cells were washed three times with medium 2, solubilized, and cell-associated 55Fe determined. To compare Fe accumulation data among cells expressing varying amounts of chimera or TR, the Fe accumulation data were normalized to surface Tf binding of 30 ng/well. Actual surface Tf binding was determined in parallel dishes as described above. Cells were preincubated for 1 h in medium 1 at 37 °C, followed by an incubation in medium 1 with 3 μg/ml iodinated Tf for >2 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed with medium 2, incubated for 2 min in 0.2 m NaCl, 50 mm MES, pH 5.0, followed by three washes with medium 2 supplemented with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf. Incubation in the acidic medium releases Tf bound to TR on the cell surface. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in medium 1 with 3 μg/ml unlabeled Tf and 100 μm of the iron chelator desferroxamine (efflux medium). At the times indicated, the medium was collected and the cells solubilized. The radioactivity in the medium is the Tf released from the cells during the incubation, and the cell-associated radioactivity is the Tf remaining inside cells. The recycling rate constant is the slope of the natural logarithm of the percent Tf remaining cell-associated versus time. To examine the effect of insulin on recycling, cells were treated as above except that the efflux medium was made 100 nm insulin. For experiments measuring the effect of wortmannin on recycling, 100 nmwortmannin was added to cells for the last 30 min of incubation with the iodinated Tf, and 100 nm wortmannin was added to all subsequent buffers used in the assay. For experiments measuring the effect of nocodazole on the recycling of the vp·TR chimera, 10 μg/ml nocodazole was added for the last 30 min of incubation with iodinated Tf and 10 μg/ml nocodazole was included in all subsequent incubations. The assay to measure recycling in streptolysin O-permeabilized cells has been described in detail (31Martys J. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Streptolysin O was purchased from Murex, Inc. (Dartford, United Kingdom). Donor cytosol was prepared from mouse liver and used at a protein concentration of 9 mg/ml (31Martys J. Shevell T. McGraw T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25976-25984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). GTPγS was used at a concentration of 50 μm. Cells, grown on coverslip bottom dishes, were incubated with 3 μg/ml Cy3-Tf in medium 1 at 37 °C for >2 h. The cells were labeled with bodipy-sphingomyelin (SM) as described previously (26Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were pre-incubated with fluorescent Tf (Cy3-Tf) for 3 h at 37 °C, chilled to 4 °C, washed once with medium 2, and the plasma membrane labeled with fluorescent SM by incubating with bodipy-SM liposomes for 30 min at 4 °C (26Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed three times with medium 2 and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in medium 2 containing 3 μg/ml Cy3-Tf. Following this incubation, the cells were placed on ice and washed three times, 5 min each wash, with 5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. To examine the steady-state distributions of Tf and SM, the cells were fixed for 20 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in medium 2. To examine the recycling of Tf and SM, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in medium 2 with 5 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 3 μg/ml Tf. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed once with medium 2 and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in medium 2. For the efflux experiments, cells were singly labeled with either Cy3-Tf or bodipy-SM and processed in parallel. For experiments using nocodazole, 10 μg/ml nocodazole was added to the cells during the first incubation with Cy3-Tf. Nocodazole was also added to the buffers used for incubations at 37 °C. The cells were examined on a Leitz DM-IRB fluorescence microscope with a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments Inc., West Chester, PA). Images were collected using Metamorph Image processing software (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, Pa). Immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular domain of the human TR (B3/25; Boehringer Mannheim) was performed as described previously (21Garippa R.J. Judge T. James D.E. McGraw T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 705-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine the role that the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains play in determining the endocytic trafficking of IRAP, two chimeras were constructed. In one, vp·TR, the 109-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of IRAP was fused to the transmembrane and extracellular domains of the human TR, and in the other, vpTM·TR, the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of IRAP were fused to the extracellular domain of the human TR (Fig. 1). TRVb CHO cells were transfected with these constructs and single colonies were isolated. TRVb CHO cells do not express functional endogenous TR and therefore provide a TR-free background for studies of the trafficking of transfected TR constructs (27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Individual clonal lines expressing the chimeras were identified by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the human TR, B3/25 (27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The wild type human TR and a cytoplasmic deletion mutant of the human TR (Δ3–59 TR) have previously been transfected into TRVb CHO cells (25Johnson L.S. Presley J.F. Park J.C McGraw T.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 27McGraw T.E., L. Greenfield L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Uptake of iodinated Tf was examined for each clone and clonal lines that express less of the chimeras than control cells express of the wild type TR were chosen for study. Several independently isolated clonal lines expressing the chimeras were studied, and in no case were there significant differences among clones expressing the same construct. Steady-state conditions were established as follows. Cells were incubated with iodinated Tf at 37 °C, and the amount of cell-associated radioactivity was determined as a function of time. Cell-associated radioactivity asymptotically approaches a plateau level in cells expressing the vp·TR chimera (Fig. 2 A). Binding of Tf to TR on the surface saturates within 5 min at 37 °C (20Dautry-Varsat A. Ciechanover A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), and the increase in cell-associated radioactive Tf reflects the delivery of internal chimeras to the surface which at the start of the experiment are unoccupied with iodinated Tf. Thus, the time required to reach the plateau level is the time required for the internal population of the chimera to cycle through the plasma membrane. In cells expressing the vp·TR chimera or the vpTM·TR chimera, the plateau level is reached within 100 min. In subsequent experiments, incubations with Tf of at least 2 h were used to measure the steady-state trafficking kinetics of the chimeras. The steady-state distributions of the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras between the surface and the cell interior were determined. At steady-state, ∼10% of the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras are on the surface, whereas ∼30% of the wild type TR and ∼70% of the Δ3–59 TR are on the surface (Fig. 2 B). The distribution of the Δ3–59 TR is shifted to the cell surface, relative to the TR, because deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of the TR removes the internalization motif and thereby slows internalization. The observation that the distribution of vp·TR is different from the distribution of the Δ3–59 TR demonstrates that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP contains information that regulates endocytic trafficking. The finding that the two chimeras have the same distribution indicates that the transmembrane domain of IRAP does not contain information that affects endocytic trafficking in CHO cells. This conclusion was confirmed upon further characterization of the trafficking parameters (see below). The observation that the distribution of vp·TR is different from that of the TR indicates differences in the trafficking of the vp·TR relative to the TR. The greater intracellular concentration of vp·TR, relative to the TR, could be due to an increased rate of internalization, a decreased rate of recycling, or changes in both parameters. The internalization rate constants of the chimeras were measured (Fig. 3 A). The vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras are internalized at essentially the same rate as the TR, which is ∼7-fold faster than the rate of Δ3–59 TR internalization. These data show that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP contains a motif that promotes rapid internalization of the vp·TR and vpTM·TR. Delivery of Fe to cells is the biological function of Tf internalization. Efficient Fe accumulation by cells is dependent on internalization of Tf into acidic endosomal compartments, where Fe is released from Tf. To determine whether Tf internalized by the vp·TR chimera is capable of delivering Fe to cells, the ability of cells expressing vp·TR to accumulate Fe from diferric Tf was measured (Fig. 3 B). Cells expressing the vp·TR chimera accumulate Fe from diferric Tf as efficiently as do cells expressing the TR, indicating that vp·TR delivers Tf to acidic endosomal compartments. We next determined the rate at which the chimeras are recycled. The results from a representative experiment are shown in Fig. 4 (A and B). In cells expressing the wild type TR, greater than 80% of the Tf is released from cells within 60 min. In cells expressing the vp·TR chimera, the decrease in cell-associated Tf is slow relative to that observed in cells expressing the TR. Although the release of Tf is slower in cells expressing the vp·TR chimera, Tf is recycled from these cells to the same degree as it is in cells expressing the TR, with greater than 80% of the Tf released by 120 min. The slow recycling of Tf in cells expressing the vp·TR chimera is not due to inefficient Fe release from Tf, inasmuch as Fe is efficiently released from Tf internalized into cells by vp·TR, as shown in Fig. 3 B. Greater than 90% of the Tf released from cells expressing either vp·TR or wild type TR was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. These data indicate that Tf is recycled intact and it is not being significantly targeted to degradative endosomal compartments. To quantify the differences in recycling rates between vp·TR and the TR, the initial recycling rate constants were calculated by plotting the natural log of the percent cell-associated Tf versustime (Fig. 4 B). The mean recycling rate constants for the TR, the Δ3–59 TR, and the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras are presented in Fig. 4 C. The recycling rate of the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras is ∼3-fold slower than the recycling rate of the TR. The Δ3–59 TR is recycled at the same rate as the TR because the recycling of membrane proteins back to the cells surface is by a bulk flow process (26Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 32Presley J.F. Mayor S. Dunn K.W. Johnson L.S. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus, finding that vp·TR and vpTM·TR are more slowly recycled than either the Δ3–59 TR or the TR demonstrates that the cytoplasmic domain of IRAP contains information that slows recycling. At steady state, the distribution of a membrane protein between the surface and interior of cells is determined by the ratio of the recycling to internalization rate constants (25Johnson L.S. Presley J.F. Park J.C McGraw T.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The measured rates of internalization and recycling for the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras are consistent with 8% of the chimeras being on the cell surface at steady state, which is comparable to the measured values of ∼10% (see Fig. 2 B). Thus, the slower recycling of the vp·TR and vpTM·TR chimeras, relative to the TR, accounts for the more pronounced intracellular localization of the chimera. Because we find no differences in the kinetics of trafficking of vp·TR an"
https://openalex.org/W2067487275,"We have previously shown that inactivation of mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (M6P/IGF2R) is a common early event in both human liver and breast carcinogenesis. The M6p/Igf2r is imprinted in mice while expression is biallelic in most humans. In this investigation the M6p/Igf2r gene is shown to also be imprinted in the liver of Fischer 344, Lewis and Brown Norway rats. In addition, we have identified mutations in the expressed allele of the M6p/Igf2r in 40% of diethylnitrosamine-initiated rat liver tumors. These results provide further evidence that the M6P/IGF2R functions as a liver tumor suppressor gene. They also suggest that mice and rats would be more sensitive than humans to those hepatocarcinogens in which the M6p/Igf2r is mechanistically involved in transformation since one rather than two alleles would need to be inactivated."
https://openalex.org/W2328339687,"We analysed 50 gastric carcinomas (GCs) to verify whether mutations at coding repeats were associated with microsatellite instability (MSI). The tumors included: ten cases with no MSI, 14 cases with MSI=1 locus, 13 cases with MSI=two loci and 13 cases with MSI⩾3 loci. We investigated coding repeats within the TGF-β RII, IGFIIR, BAX, hMSH6, hMSH3 and BRCA2 genes. The TGF-β RII, IGFIIR, BAX, hMSH6 and hMSH3 repeats were altered in 11 (22%), five (10%), four (8%), 16 (32%) and five (10%) cases respectively. Mutations occurred only in MSI-positive (MSI+) tumors and correlated with increasing MSI levels. No alterations of the BRCA2 repeat were found. Mutations in genes other than hMSH6 were strongly associated to hMSH6 mutations, suggesting a key role of this gene. The non-coding BAT-26 and E-Cadherin 3′ UTR poly(A)8/(T)15 repeats were analysed in 44 of the 50 cases. Novel tumor-associated alleles were observed only in MSI-positive GCs and were in most cases associated with mutations at coding repeats. Further investigations with BAT-40 confirmed that four cases manifested mononucleotide repeat alterations restricted to hMSH6 and one case to TGF-β RII. A subset of tumors with MSI at two or more dinucleotide loci resulted negative for mutations at coding and non-coding mononucleotide repeats."
https://openalex.org/W2312332840,"Tec is a non-receptor type tyrosine kinase which is tyrosine phosphorylated and activated upon stimulation of hematopoietic cells with various cytokines. The role of Tec in G protein-coupled receptor- and integrin-mediated signalings has not been elucidated. We therefore investigated the regulation of Tec in human blood platelets. Tec was rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to platelet agonists which activate G protein-coupled receptors such as thromboxane A2 analog (U46619), thrombin, and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). TRAP-induced phosphorylation in Tec was significantly reduced under the conditions which abrogate fibrinogen binding to GP IIb–IIIa and subsequent platelet aggregation. However, TRAP induced significant levels of the phosphorylation even under these conditions and also in thrombasthenic platelets which lack functional GP IIb–IIIa molecules, suggesting that activation of G-protein-coupled receptor causes the phosphorylation. To clarify whether integrin engagement by itself causes the phosphorylation in Tec, we examined the state of the phosphorylation in platelets activated by integrin engagement. Platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen or collagen induced significant levels of the phosphorylation. Furthermore, Tec was translocated to cytoskeleton in response to TRAP in a manner dependent on platelet aggregation, suggesting that Tec can be a component of integrin-mediated signalings. These results collectively indicate that Tec is involved in G protein-coupled receptor- and integrin-mediated signalings in human blood platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1995907346,"The regulatory elements CIIC (−159/−116) and CIIB (−102/−81) of the apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) promoter have distinct specificities for orphan nuclear receptors (Vorgia, P., Zannis, V. I., and Kardassis, D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 4188–4199). In this communication we investigated the contribution of ligand-dependent and orphan nuclear receptors on the transcriptional regulation of the humanapoCIIgene. It was found that element CIIC in addition to ARP-1 and EAR-2 binds RXRα/T3Rβ heterodimers strongly, whereas element CIIB binds hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) exclusively. Binding is abolished by mutations that alter the HRE binding motifs.Transient cotransfection experiments showed that in the presence of T3, RXRα/T3Rβ heterodimers transactivated the −205/+18 apoCII promoter 1.6- and 11-fold in HepG2 and COS-1 respectively. No transactivation was observed in the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid. Transactivation requires the regulatory element CIIC, suggesting that this element contains a thyroid hormone response element. HNF-4 did not affect the apoCII promoter activity in HepG2 cells. However, mutations in the HNF-4 binding site on element CIIB and inhibition of HNF-4 synthesis in HepG2 cells by antisense HNF-4 constructs decreased the apoCII promoter activity to 25–40% of the control, indicating that HNF-4 is a positive regulator of the apoCII gene. ARP-1 repressed the −205/+18 but not the −104/+18 apoCII promoter activity in HepG2 cells, indicating that the repression depends on the regulatory element CIIC. In contrast, combination of ARP-1 and HNF-4 transactivated different apoCII promoter segments as well as a minimal adenovirus major late promoter driven by the regulatory element CIIB. Mutagenesis or deletion of elements CIIB or CIIC established that the observed transactivation requires DNA binding of one of the two factors and may result from HNF-4-ARP-1 interactions that elicit the transactivation functions of HNF-4.The combined data indicate that RXRα/T3Rβ in the presence of T3 and HNF-4 can upregulate the apoCII promoter activity by binding to the regulatory elements CIIC and CIIB, respectively. In addition, ARP-1 can either have inhibitory or stimulatory effects on the apoCII promoter activity via different mechanisms. The regulatory elements CIIC (−159/−116) and CIIB (−102/−81) of the apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) promoter have distinct specificities for orphan nuclear receptors (Vorgia, P., Zannis, V. I., and Kardassis, D. (1998) J. Biol. Chem.273, 4188–4199). In this communication we investigated the contribution of ligand-dependent and orphan nuclear receptors on the transcriptional regulation of the humanapoCIIgene. It was found that element CIIC in addition to ARP-1 and EAR-2 binds RXRα/T3Rβ heterodimers strongly, whereas element CIIB binds hepatic nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) exclusively. Binding is abolished by mutations that alter the HRE binding motifs. Transient cotransfection experiments showed that in the presence of T3, RXRα/T3Rβ heterodimers transactivated the −205/+18 apoCII promoter 1.6- and 11-fold in HepG2 and COS-1 respectively. No transactivation was observed in the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid. Transactivation requires the regulatory element CIIC, suggesting that this element contains a thyroid hormone response element. HNF-4 did not affect the apoCII promoter activity in HepG2 cells. However, mutations in the HNF-4 binding site on element CIIB and inhibition of HNF-4 synthesis in HepG2 cells by antisense HNF-4 constructs decreased the apoCII promoter activity to 25–40% of the control, indicating that HNF-4 is a positive regulator of the apoCII gene. ARP-1 repressed the −205/+18 but not the −104/+18 apoCII promoter activity in HepG2 cells, indicating that the repression depends on the regulatory element CIIC. In contrast, combination of ARP-1 and HNF-4 transactivated different apoCII promoter segments as well as a minimal adenovirus major late promoter driven by the regulatory element CIIB. Mutagenesis or deletion of elements CIIB or CIIC established that the observed transactivation requires DNA binding of one of the two factors and may result from HNF-4-ARP-1 interactions that elicit the transactivation functions of HNF-4. The combined data indicate that RXRα/T3Rβ in the presence of T3 and HNF-4 can upregulate the apoCII promoter activity by binding to the regulatory elements CIIC and CIIB, respectively. In addition, ARP-1 can either have inhibitory or stimulatory effects on the apoCII promoter activity via different mechanisms.

To test this idea, we used single-cysteine, histidine-tagged OxlT variants to study the organization of a 30-residue segment (residues 344–373) containing this region. Topology was examined by probing the A345C and A370C proteins with Oregon Green maleimide carboxylic acid, an impermeant and fluorescent thiol-reactive agent. Examination of purified protein showed that only A370C was fluorescent after treating intact cells with the probe, while both proteins were modified in tests with isolated membrane ghosts. In addition, labeling of A370C, but not A345C, was blocked when external cysteines were protected with the impermeant and nonfluorescent agent, methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium. These findings confirm that A345 faces the cytoplasm, while A370C faces the periplasm. A similar study focused on 13 single-cysteine variants positioned throughout the target segment. That work revealed a striking discontinuity in reactivity toward Oregon Green maleimide; cysteines within a 10-residue central core (residues 351–360) were not labeled when membranes were probed, but were readily modified after protein denaturation. We suggest this core resides within the lipid bilayer, unavailable to an impermeant reporter. Since this region includes position 355, we also suggest that lysine 355 lies within the OxlT hydrophobic sector, where it may facilitate the binding and translocation of the anionic substrates, oxalate and formate.

Tomb J.-F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), suggest that added biochemical study of OxlT can be of value to the ongoing investigation of membrane transport.Hydropathy analysis of the OxlT amino acid sequence suggests the presence of 12 hydrophobic segments (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and circular dichroism spectroscopy of purified, solubilized OxlT supports the idea that these segments are structured as membrane-spanning α-helices (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A closer examination of the putative OxlT topology reveals an unexpected feature, however; the hydrophobic sector appears to contain a single charged residue, a lysine (Lys355) positioned near the center of transmembrane helix 11 (TM11) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane helix; OGM, Oregon Green 488 maleimide carboxylic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate etheyltrimethylammonium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane helix; OGM, Oregon Green 488 maleimide carboxylic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate etheyltrimethylammonium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is counterintuitive, since placement of an uncompensated charge within a hydrophobic environment can significantly destabilize a membrane protein (12Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17002) Google Scholar, 13Engleman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the location of Lys355might be rationalized if such an energetic disadvantage contributed an electrostatic component utilized in the process of transport. This idea is all the more attractive because OxlT must capture and translocate anions (oxalate and formate), implying direct interaction between the negatively charged substrate and unidentified positive element(s) within a translocation pathway. In this latter circumstance, Lys355 becomes a likely candidate.Such an argument depends heavily on one interpretation of hydropathy, and it is essential to have positive experimental evidence that confirms or rejects this view before embarking on any extended study. The work reported here was designed to address this specific issue by answering two questions. (i) Does the segment containing Lys355 actually span the plasma membrane? (ii) Where within this interval does Lys355 reside, relative to the internal and external aqueous phases? As a tool to answer these questions, we generated a panel of single-cysteine mutants spanning the entirety of TM11, so that the environment at each position could be probed with a membrane-impermeable fluorescent reporter, OGM. Use of this approach allowed us to confirm the postulated topology in this region and to identify a set of 10 contiguous residues (residues 351–360) that form an inaccessible core within TM11, thereby defining the location of Lys355 as at the center of the OxlT hydrophobic sector.DISCUSSIONThe work described here has focused on a 30-residue segment (residues 344–373) in the anion exchange transporter, OxlT. In particular, we sought to confirm or reject the idea of a transmembrane segment in this region and to determine whether a basic residue in the center of this segment (Lys355) is within the OxlT hydrophobic sector, where the presence of a resident positive charge might influence substrate binding and translocation. To address these issues, we exploited affinity purification of histidine-tagged OxlT (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) along with cysteine scanning mutagenesis and use of impermeant and fluorescent, thiol-directed probes. Together, these tools allowed us to document residue accessibility, and therefore topology, by examining the fluorescence of purified protein.Success in such work depends principally on use of an impermeant fluorescent probe, and for this purpose we selected OGM, a maleimide-linked reporter having both acidic hydroxyl (pK = 4.7) and carboxyl (pKa < 5) functions. The modest size (460 daltons) and the charged nature of this probe suggested it would penetrate the outer membrane of E. coli yet not permeate across the plasma membrane, a presumption supported by two kinds of observations. First, when OGM was used to treat intact cells, a cysteine (A370C) expected to be exposed externally was readily modified, while sparing an internal cysteine (A345C) (Fig. 3, experiment 1). Second (Fig. 3, experiment 2), we could also show that the external cysteine (A370C) was protected by treating cells with the impermeant quaternary amine, MTSET, without effect on subsequent OGM reactivity of the internal target (A345C).The reactivity of variants A345C and A370C to these impermeant probes (OGM, MTSET) (Fig. 3) supports several conclusions. Clearly, these positions lie at opposite membrane surfaces, with A345C facing the cytoplasm and A370C the periplasm, as predicted by the initial analysis of hydropathy (11Abe K.

It is also evident that the entire population of OxlT is of uniform topology, indicating use of this heterologous overexpression system (E. coli) has not affected overall protein organization. It may be noted that in work with the intact cells we did not vary the membrane potential, the main component of the protonmotive force at pH 8 (9Harold F.M. Maloney P.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.

While it is feasible that this parameter may affect the kinetics of OGM labeling, it seems unlikely that this would significantly alter our main conclusions (above). Such findings therefore justify use of the same approach to determining topology for other regions of OxlT; in fact, analysis of OGM accessibility of cysteines at positions 373 and 409 confirms the predicted orientation of TM12. 2T. Jung and P. C. Maloney, unpublished results. We believe this strategy may also be of a more general utility, since it is increasingly common that membrane proteins are purified by affinity methods (cf. Tamai et al. (18Tamai E. Fann F.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Aside from simplicity, the advantage of this approach described here is that topology is documented in the context of the whole molecule. This contrasts with more widely used genetic methods that infer topology from the disposition of reporter molecules fused to fragments of the target (e.g. see Calamia and Manoil (19Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)).The main goal of this work was to use site-directed fluorescence to determine whether Lys355 is within the TM11 hydrophobic core. Study of K355C itself was not feasible, for while this variant is fully expressed, its null phenotype (Fig. 2) raises doubts concerning structure in the vicinity of position 355. Accordingly, the location of Lys355 was inferred from the behavior of functional derivatives spanning the entirety of TM11. That work (Fig. 4) revealed a striking discontinuity in OGM accessibility along TM11. Thus, when OxlT was labeled in situ, cysteines within a central 10-residue segment (residues 351–360) failed to react with OGM, while cysteines at either end gave fluorescent product (Fig. 4). There are two general explanations for such findings. One interpretation is that the region of low reactivity (positions 351–360) is within the lipid bilayer and hence unavailable to the impermeant probe, and a semiquantitative argument is consistent with this suggestion. Thus, on modification of its target, the OGM carboxylate lies about 8–10 Å from the cysteinyl sulfur. Accordingly, one expects cysteines that react with OGM to be within 8–10 Å of the external or internal aqueous phases. And if TM11 is a transmembrane α-helix, of the 20–25 residues that span the 30–40-Å bilayer, one expects a central core of some 10 residues (e.g. residues 351–360) to be inaccessible to OGM for purely geometric reasons. A biotin-linked maleimide of similar dimensions defines a comparable set of core residues along TM7 of UhpT, the E. coli sugar phosphate transporter (20Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-19575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A second line of reasoning suggests that cysteines in this core are unreactive for reasons of chemistry, in that they display the high pKa (pKa = 14) characteristic of cysteine in a nonpolar (i.e. lipid) environment. In this second case, the reactive sulfide (–S1−) would be not be at sufficiently high concentration to support modification. One presumes this principle underlies the low N-ethylmaleimide reactivity of single-cysteine derivatives of TM9 in the tetracylcine antiporter, TetA (21Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We caution, however, that such alternative explanations are not mutually exclusive. Rather, a transmembrane helix may have positions facing other helices or the hydrophilic translocation pathway (cf. Goswitz and Brooker (22Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)); these positions may be inaccessible, but possibly chemically reactive. Or, there may be positions facing membrane lipid, and while these may be accessible, they are most likely chemically unreactive. In either case, the finding that residues 351–360 form the core of TM11 effectively positions Lys355 at the center of the OxlT hydrophobic sector.While the conclusion that TM11 has an inaccessible core of about 10 residues is not surprising, it is unusual that this core includes a basic residue, Lys355. As judged from examples known at a crystallographic level, transmembrane helices do not typically contain charged residues (23Deisenhofer J. Michael H.

Hydropathy analysis of the OxlT sequence does not suggest an anionic partner which might pair with Lys355(11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and for this reason one should now consider the alternative hypothesis that this basic residue, by virtue of its location at the center of TM11, is strategically placed to interact directly with OxlT substrates as they enter the hydrophilic translocation pathway, much as anionic residues in the Na+/melibiose MelB symporter are thought to interact directly with the cosubstrate, Na+ (32Pourcher T., M.L.

This last possibility has further merit in that it may help explain the marked effect of oxalate on OxlT stability. Thus, substrate binding energy dramatically increases the stability of the purified protein in lipid/detergent micelles (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An attractive explanation for this phenomenon is that the anionic substrate donates a negative charge that removes an unavoidable destabilizing element contributed by the uncompensated, resident cation, Lys355. Solute transporters comprise a large, broadly homologous collection of membrane proteins that catalyze the transmembrane passage of impermeable substrates (1Griffith J.K. Baker M.E. Rouch D.A.

Despite their numbers, however, only a few models are available for study at the level of biochemistry and biophysics. One such model is the transporter, OxlT (5Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T.

Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This electrogenic exchange, in combination with consumption of a single internal proton during oxalate decarboxylation, functions as a virtual proton pump, enabling this cell to generate ATP by decarboxylative phosphorylation (3Maloney P.C.

Tomb J.-F. et al.Nature. 1997; 390: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), suggest that added biochemical study of OxlT can be of value to the ongoing investigation of membrane transport. Hydropathy analysis of the OxlT amino acid sequence suggests the presence of 12 hydrophobic segments (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and circular dichroism spectroscopy of purified, solubilized OxlT supports the idea that these segments are structured as membrane-spanning α-helices (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A closer examination of the putative OxlT topology reveals an unexpected feature, however; the hydrophobic sector appears to contain a single charged residue, a lysine (Lys355) positioned near the center of transmembrane helix 11 (TM11) 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane helix; OGM, Oregon Green 488 maleimide carboxylic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate etheyltrimethylammonium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane helix; OGM, Oregon Green 488 maleimide carboxylic acid; MTSET, methanethiosulfonate etheyltrimethylammonium; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This is counterintuitive, since placement of an uncompensated charge within a hydrophobic environment can significantly destabilize a membrane protein (12Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17002) Google Scholar, 13Engleman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the location of Lys355might be rationalized if such an energetic disadvantage contributed an electrostatic component utilized in the process of transport. This idea is all the more attractive because OxlT must capture and translocate anions (oxalate and formate), implying direct interaction between the negatively charged substrate and unidentified positive element(s) within a translocation pathway. In this latter circumstance, Lys355 becomes a likely candidate. Such an argument depends heavily on one interpretation of hydropathy, and it is essential to have positive experimental evidence that confirms or rejects this view before embarking on any extended study. The work reported here was designed to address this specific issue by answering two questions. (i) Does the segment containing Lys355 actually span the plasma membrane? (ii) Where within this interval does Lys355 reside, relative to the internal and external aqueous phases? As a tool to answer these questions, we generated a panel of single-cysteine mutants spanning the entirety of TM11, so that the environment at each position could be probed with a membrane-impermeable fluorescent reporter, OGM. Use of this approach allowed us to confirm the postulated topology in this region and to identify a set of 10 contiguous residues (residues 351–360) that form an inaccessible core within TM11, thereby defining the location of Lys355 as at the center of the OxlT hydrophobic sector. DISCUSSIONThe work described here has focused on a 30-residue segment (residues 344–373) in the anion exchange transporter, OxlT. In particular, we sought to confirm or reject the idea of a transmembrane segment in this region and to determine whether a basic residue in the center of this segment (Lys355) is within the OxlT hydrophobic sector, where the presence of a resident positive charge might influence substrate binding and translocation. To address these issues, we exploited affinity purification of histidine-tagged OxlT (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) along with cysteine scanning mutagenesis and use of impermeant and fluorescent, thiol-directed probes. Together, these tools allowed us to document residue accessibility, and therefore topology, by examining the fluorescence of purified protein.Success in such work depends principally on use of an impermeant fluorescent probe, and for this purpose we selected OGM, a maleimide-linked reporter having both acidic hydroxyl (pK = 4.7) and carboxyl (pKa < 5) functions. The modest size (460 daltons) and the charged nature of this probe suggested it would penetrate the outer membrane of E. coli yet not permeate across the plasma membrane, a presumption supported by two kinds of observations. First, when OGM was used to treat intact cells, a cysteine (A370C) expected to be exposed externally was readily modified, while sparing an internal cysteine (A345C) (Fig. 3, experiment 1). Second (Fig. 3, experiment 2), we could also show that the external cysteine (A370C) was protected by treating cells with the impermeant quaternary amine, MTSET, without effect on subsequent OGM reactivity of the internal target (A345C).The reactivity of variants A345C and A370C to these impermeant probes (OGM, MTSET) (Fig. 3) supports several conclusions. Clearly, these positions lie at opposite membrane surfaces, with A345C facing the cytoplasm and A370C the periplasm, as predicted by the initial analysis of hydropathy (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is also evident that the entire population of OxlT is of uniform topology, indicating use of this heterologous overexpression system (E. coli) has not affected overall protein organization. It may be noted that in work with the intact cells we did not vary the membrane potential, the main component of the protonmotive force at pH 8 (9Harold F.M. Maloney P.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R.

First, when OGM was used to treat intact cells, a cysteine (A370C) expected to be exposed externally was readily modified, while sparing an internal cysteine (A345C) (Fig. 3, experiment 1). Second (Fig. 3, experiment 2), we could also show that the external cysteine (A370C) was protected by treating cells with the impermeant quaternary amine, MTSET, without effect on subsequent OGM reactivity of the internal target (A345C). The reactivity of variants A345C and A370C to these impermeant probes (OGM, MTSET) (Fig. 3) supports several conclusions. Clearly, these positions lie at opposite membrane surfaces, with A345C facing the cytoplasm and A370C the periplasm, as predicted by the initial analysis of hydropathy (11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is also evident that the entire population of OxlT is of uniform topology, indicating use of this heterologous overexpression system (E. coli) has not affected overall protein organization. It may be noted that in work with the intact cells we did not vary the membrane potential, the main component of the protonmotive force at pH 8 (9Harold F.M. Maloney P.C. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. in Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 283-306Google Scholar). While it is feasible that this parameter may affect the kinetics of OGM labeling, it seems unlikely that this would significantly alter our main conclusions (above). Such findings therefore justify use of the same approach to determining topology for other regions of OxlT; in fact, analysis of OGM accessibility of cysteines at positions 373 and 409 confirms the predicted orientation of TM12. 2T. Jung and P. C. Maloney, unpublished results. We believe this strategy may also be of a more general utility, since it is increasingly common that membrane proteins are purified by affinity methods (cf. Tamai et al. (18Tamai E. Fann F.-C. Tsuchiya T. Maloney P.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar)). Aside from simplicity, the advantage of this approach described here is that topology is documented in the context of the whole molecule. This contrasts with more widely used genetic methods that infer topology from the disposition of reporter molecules fused to fragments of the target (e.g. see Calamia and Manoil (19Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar)). The main goal of this work was to use site-directed fluorescence to determine whether Lys355 is within the TM11 hydrophobic core. Study of K355C itself was not feasible, for while this variant is fully expressed, its null phenotype (Fig. 2) raises doubts concerning structure in the vicinity of position 355. Accordingly, the location of Lys355 was inferred from the behavior of functional derivatives spanning the entirety of TM11. That work (Fig. 4) revealed a striking discontinuity in OGM accessibility along TM11. Thus, when OxlT was labeled in situ, cysteines within a central 10-residue segment (residues 351–360) failed to react with OGM, while cysteines at either end gave fluorescent product (Fig. 4). There are two general explanations for such findings. One interpretation is that the region of low reactivity (positions 351–360) is within the lipid bilayer and hence unavailable to the impermeant probe, and a semiquantitative argument is consistent with this suggestion. Thus, on modification of its target, the OGM carboxylate lies about 8–10 Å from the cysteinyl sulfur. Accordingly, one expects cysteines that react with OGM to be within 8–10 Å of the external or internal aqueous phases. And if TM11 is a transmembrane α-helix, of the 20–25 residues that span the 30–40-Å bilayer, one expects a central core of some 10 residues (e.g. residues 351–360) to be inaccessible to OGM for purely geometric reasons. A biotin-linked maleimide of similar dimensions defines a comparable set of core residues along TM7 of UhpT, the E. coli sugar phosphate transporter (20Matos M. Fann M.-C. Yan R.-T. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18571-19575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A second line of reasoning suggests that cysteines in this core are unreactive for reasons of chemistry, in that they display the high pKa (pKa = 14) characteristic of cysteine in a nonpolar (i.e. lipid) environment. In this second case, the reactive sulfide (–S1−) would be not be at sufficiently high concentration to support modification. One presumes this principle underlies the low N-ethylmaleimide reactivity of single-cysteine derivatives of TM9 in the tetracylcine antiporter, TetA (21Kimura T. Suzuki M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15896-15899Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We caution, however, that such alternative explanations are not mutually exclusive. Rather, a transmembrane helix may have positions facing other helices or the hydrophilic translocation pathway (cf. Goswitz and Brooker (22Goswitz V.C. Brooker R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)); these positions may be inaccessible, but possibly chemically reactive. Or, there may be positions facing membrane lipid, and while these may be accessible, they are most likely chemically unreactive. In either case, the finding that residues 351–360 form the core of TM11 effectively positions Lys355 at the center of the OxlT hydrophobic sector. While the conclusion that TM11 has an inaccessible core of about 10 residues is not surprising, it is unusual that this core includes a basic residue, Lys355. As judged from examples known at a crystallographic level, transmembrane helices do not typically contain charged residues (23Deisenhofer J. Michael H.

Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar), and if they are present, it is almost always in combination with a second residue of opposite charge (24Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar, 25Iwata S. Ostermeier C. Ludwig B. Michel H.

Biol. 1996; 259: 393-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar), a conclusion also reached during genetic and biochemical studies of the LacY symporter (29King S.C. Hansen C.L. Wilson T.H.

Hydropathy analysis of the OxlT sequence does not suggest an anionic partner which might pair with Lys355(11Abe K. Ruan Zhong-Shi Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and for this reason one should now consider the alternative hypothesis that this basic residue, by virtue of its location at the center of TM11, is strategically placed to interact directly with OxlT substrates as they enter the hydrophilic translocation pathway, much as anionic residues in the Na+/melibiose MelB symporter are thought to interact directly with the cosubstrate, Na+ (32Pourcher T., M.L. Zani Leblanc G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3209-3215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Hama H. Wilson T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This last possibility has further merit in that it may help explain the marked effect of oxalate on OxlT stability. Thus, substrate binding energy dramatically increases the stability of the purified protein in lipid/detergent micelles (6Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Maloney P.C. Anantharam V. Allison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An attractive explanation for this phenomenon is that the anionic substrate donates a negative charge that removes an unavoidable destabilizing element contributed by the uncompensated, resident cation, Lys355.

https://openalex.org/W2322370416,"Bracken fern is the environmental co-carcinogen of BPV-4 in the induction of neoplasias of the upper alimentary canal of cattle. The flavonoid quercetin is one of the most potent and best characterised mutagens present in the fern. We have shown that transfection with BPV-4 DNA and exposure to a single dose of quercetin leads to tumorigenic transformation of primary bovine cells. We now show that quercetin induces cell cycle arrest and up-regulates transcription from the BPV-4 long control region (LCR). This up-regulation is mediated by a 21 nucleotide-long cis-element in the LCR, designated QRE-1, which is located immediately downstream of the TATA box. Cellular proteins bind to QRE-1 and removal or substitution of QRE-1 lead to the abrogation of the response to quercetin. As expression of the viral oncogenes is controlled by the LCR, perturbation in this control and increased oncoprotein expression are likely to contribute to fully malignant cell transformation by overcoming the cell cycle arrest induced by quercetin, thus forcing damaged cells to proliferate."
https://openalex.org/W2333374528,"Drug resistance that occurs during cancer chemotherapy has been a major problem in controlling neoplastic progression. To study the cellular mechanisms of acquired drug resistance we developed 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3)-resistant sublines of promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cells which have increased proliferation rates (Exp. Cell Res., 224, 312, 1996; Cancer Res., 50, 5513, 1996). We report here that the resistant sublines display varying degrees of shortening of the G1 phase as compared to the parental HL60-G cells. Protein levels of cyclins E, D1, D2 and D3 are elevated in these resistant cell lines, and cyclin D1 is especially high in 40AF cells, which has the shortest G1 length. The protein levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)2, Cdk4 and Cdk6 are not altered in the resistant sublines. Both Cdk2 and Cdk6-associated kinase activites are increased in the resistant sublines, but not Cdk4 kinase activity. Protein levels of p27Kip1 are not consistently altered in the resistant sublines as compared to the parental HL60-G cells, but are reduced relative to HL60-G cells arrested by 96 h treatment with 1,25D3. Interestingly, the resistant cell lines constitutively express high levels of retinoblastoma protein (pRb), and pRb is highly phosphorylated, indicating that the G1 cyclin/Cdk complexes in the resistant cells are physiologically active. The results suggest that the increased activity of cyclin D/Cdk6, and perhaps cyclin E/Cdk2, lead to rapid hyperphosphorylation of pRb and consequently a shorter early G1 phase, and that in the resistant cells the increased ratio of cyclin E to p27Kip1 results in activation of Cdk2 and contributes to the abrogation of the 1,25D3-induced block to the S phase entry. Additionally, it is apparent that constitutively increased levels of pRb are compatible with increased rates of cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2329313477,"The human TSG101 gene was cloned and mapped to chromosome 11p15, a site suspected to contain a tumor suppressor gene involved in a variety of human cancers. Subsequent investigation described the presence of abnormally spliced transcripts and point mutations of TSG101 in breast cancer. Thus, we performed RT–PCR amplification of the entire open reading frame of TSG101 to test for aberrant transcripts in various human tumor cell lines derived from breast, bladder, head and neck, and lung cancer. In addition, we performed RT–PCR on cDNA from primary human breast and Wilms' tumor tissue. We found a single band of the expected size in 10 of 11 breast cancers and 6 of 6 Wilms' tumor samples after the first round of PCR. The remaining breast cancer sample displayed a barely visible smaller band. However, aberrant bands appeared in most cases after performing nested PCR casting doubt on the physiologic relevance of these spliced variants. We then searched for small intragenic mutations by complete sequence analysis of TSG101 in breast cancer cell lines and tumors, as well as in Wilms' tumors and normal fetal and adult kidney. No point mutations were found in any of the samples, including four breast tumors with chormosomal loss at 11p15. We found no consistent evidence of aberrant splicing or point mutations in breast cancer or Wilms' tumor suggesting that TSG101 is not a primary target of inactivation in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2331508455,"Ras-mediated signaling pathways play a critical role in cellular proliferation and differentiation. Although it has been demonstrated that Ras interacts with Raf-1 to stimulate the serine/threonine kinase activity of Raf-1, the precise mechanism by which Ras activates Raf-1 remains obscure. To address this question, we developed a cell-free system in which the activated form of H-Ras can induce Raf-1 activation. Using this system, we found the presence of a new protein factor, in cytosolic fractions of both human embryonic kidney 293 cells and rat brain tissues, that is required for Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1. The factor was purified from rat brain cytosols through successive column chromatographies on DEAE Sephacel, SP Sepharose and Sephacryl S-300. The approximate molecular weight of the activator was estimated as 400,000 by gel filtration. Its activity was sensitive to heat and trypsin treatments. The purified activator did not contain Src, 14-3-3, protein kinase C, JAK2 or Ksr-1, as judged by immunoblotting. Further characterization of the activator is underway."
