Largely through their ability to overcome the limitations of conventional fiber optics-for example, by permitting low-loss guidance of light in a hollow core-these fibers are proving to have a multitude of important technological and scientific applications spanning many disciplines. The result has been a renaissance of interest in optical fibers and their uses."

However, initiation of adaptive immune responses is also controlled by regulatory T cells (T R cells), which act to prevent activation of autoreactive T cells. Here we describe a second mechanism of immune induction by TLRs, which is independent of effects on costimulation. Microbial induction of the Toll pathway blocked the suppressive effect of CD4 + CD25 + T R cells, allowing activation of pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses. This block of suppressor activity was dependent in part on interleukin-6, which was induced by TLRs upon recognition of microbial products."
https://openalex.org/W1966751543,"We report the design of surfaces that exhibit dynamic changes in interfacial properties, such as wettability, in response to an electrical potential. The change in wetting behavior was caused by surface-confined, single-layered molecules undergoing conformational transitions between a hydrophilic and a moderately hydrophobic state. Reversible conformational transitions were confirmed at a molecular level with the use of sum-frequency generation spectroscopy and at a macroscopic level with the use of contact angle measurements. This type of surface design enables amplification of molecular-level conformational transitions to macroscopic changes in surface properties without altering the chemical identity of the surface. Such reversibly switching surfaces may open previously unknown opportunities in interfacial engineering."

In the ocean, tunas and sea turtles are current conservation concerns because of this intense pressure. The status of most shark species, in contrast, remains uncertain. Using the largest data set in the Northwest Atlantic, we show rapid large declines in large coastal and oceanic shark populations. Scalloped hammerhead, white, and thresher sharks are each estimated to have declined by over 75% in the past 15 years. Closed-area models highlight priority areas for shark conservation, and the need to consider effort reallocation and site selection if marine reserves are to benefit multiple threatened species."

https://openalex.org/W2081989905,We report that the flow of a liquid on single-walled carbon nanotube bundles induces a voltage in the sample along the direction of the flow. The voltage that was produced fit a logarithmic velocity dependence over nearly six decades of velocity. The magnitude of the voltage depended sensitively on the ionic conductivity and on the polar nature of the liquid. Our measurements suggest that the dominant mechanism responsible for this highly nonlinear response involves a direct forcing of the free charge carriers in the nanotubes by the fluctuating Coulombic field of the liquid flowing past the nanotubes. We propose an explanation based on pulsating asymmetric ratchets. Our work highlights the device potential for nanotubes as sensitive flow sensors and for energy conversion.

The flavanol (–)-epicatechin is a component of many CTs and contributes to flavor and astringency in tea and wine. We show that the BANYULS ( BAN ) genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula encode anthocyanidin reductase, which converts anthocyanidins to their corresponding 2,3- cis -flavan-3-ols. Ectopic expression of BAN in tobacco flower petals and Arabidopsis leaves results in loss of anthocyanins and accumulation of CTs."
https://openalex.org/W2039585575,"Trophoblast adhesion to the uterine wall is the requisite first step of implantation and, subsequently, placentation. At the maternal-fetal interface, we investigated the expression of selectin adhesion systems that enable leukocyte capture from the bloodstream. On the maternal side, human uterine epithelial cells up-regulated selectin oligosaccharide-based ligands during the window of receptivity. On the fetal side, human trophoblasts expressed L-selectin. This ligand-receptor system was functional, because beads coated with the selectin ligand 6-sulfo sLe(x) bound to trophoblasts, and trophoblasts bound to ligand-expressing uterine luminal epithelium in tissue sections. These results suggest that trophoblast L-selectin mediates interactions with the uterus and that this adhesion mechanism may be critical to establishing human pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2073897003,"The global predominance of three clonal Toxoplasma gondii lineages suggests that they are endowed with an exceptional trait responsible for their current parasitism of nearly all warm-blooded vertebrates. Genetic polymorphism analyses indicate that these clonal lineages emerged within the last 10,000 years after a single genetic cross. Comparison with ancient strains (∼1 million years) suggests that the success of the clonal lineages resulted from the concurrent acquisition of direct oral infectivity. This key adaptation circumvented sexual recombination, simultaneously promoting transmission through successive hosts, hence leading to clonal expansion. Thus, changes in complex life cycles can occur rapidly and can profoundly influence pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2049241995,"The symbiosis between fungus-growing ants and the fungi they cultivate for food has been shaped by 50 million years of coevolution. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this long coevolutionary history includes a third symbiont lineage: specialized microfungal parasites of the ants' fungus gardens. At ancient levels, the phylogenies of the three symbionts are perfectly congruent, revealing that the ant-microbe symbiosis is the product of tripartite coevolution between the farming ants, their cultivars, and the garden parasites. At recent phylogenetic levels, coevolution has been punctuated by occasional host-switching by the parasite, thus intensifying continuous coadaptation between symbionts in a tripartite arms race."
https://openalex.org/W2057086747,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are zinc endopeptidases that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components during normal and pathogenic tissue remodeling. Inappropriate expression of these enzymes contributes to the development of vascular pathology, including atherosclerosis. MMP-9 is expressed in its active form in atherosclerotic lesions and is believed to play an important role in vascular remodeling, smooth muscle cell migration, and plaque instability. We demonstrate here that the liver X receptors (LXRs) LXRα and LXRβ inhibit basal and cytokine-inducible expression of MMP-9. Treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with the synthetic LXR agonists GW3965 or T1317 reduces MMP-9 mRNA expression and blunts its induction by pro-inflammatory stimuli including lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α. In contrast, macrophage expression of MMP-12 and MMP-13 is not altered by LXR ligands. We further show that the ability of LXR ligands to regulate MMP-9 expression is strictly receptor-dependent and is not observed in macrophages obtained from LXRαβ null mice. Analysis of the 5′-flanking region of the <i>MMP-9</i> gene indicates that LXR/RXR heterodimers do not bind directly to the<i>MMP-9</i> promoter. Rather, activation of LXRs represses<i>MMP-9</i> expression, at least in part through antagonism of the NFκB signaling pathway. These observations identify the regulation of macrophage MMP-9 expression as a mechanism whereby activation of LXRs may impact macrophage inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2139369379,"Striking circular, labyrinthine, polygonal, and striped patterns of stones and soil self-organize in many polar and high alpine environments. These forms emerge because freeze-thaw cycles drive an interplay between two feedback mechanisms. First, formation of ice lenses in freezing soil sorts stones and soil by displacing soil toward soil-rich domains and stones toward stone-rich domains. Second, stones are transported along the axis of elongate stone domains, which are squeezed and confined as freezing soil domains expand. In a numerical model implementing these feedbacks, circles, labyrinths, and islands form when sorting dominates; polygonal networks form when stone domain squeezing and confinement dominate; and stripes form as hillslope gradient is increased."
https://openalex.org/W2144871914,"In a conventional material, the coherent Cerenkov radiation due to a moving charged particle is associated with a velocity threshold, a forward-pointing radiation cone, and a forward direction of emission. We describe different behavior for the Cerenkov radiation in a photonic crystal. In particular, this radiation is intrinsically coupled with transition radiation and is observable without any threshold. Within one particle-velocity range, we found a radiation pattern with a backward-pointing radiation cone. In another velocity range, backward-propagating Cerenkov radiation can be expected. Potential applications include velocity-sensitive particle detection and radiation generation at selectable frequencies."

It is widely recognized that advances in genetics and molecular neurobiology will hasten the identification of new molecular targets, but these may not result in effective new treatments unless we also develop better targets: dimensions of psychopathology or dysfunction more proximate to pathophysiology. Such clinical targets are not necessarily well represented in our currently accepted clinical endpoints and consensus-derived diagnostic systems for mental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2038014924,"We achieved automated optical control over coherent lattice responses that were both time- and position-dependent across macroscopic length scales. In our experiments, spatiotemporal femtosecond pulse shaping was used to generate excitation light fields that were directed toward distinct regions of crystalline samples, producing terahertz-frequency lattice vibrational waves that emanated outward from their multiple origins at lightlike speeds. Interferences among the waves resulted in fully specified far-field responses, including tilted, focusing, or amplified wavefronts. Generation and coherent amplification of terahertz traveling waves and terahertz phased-array generation also were demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1985053875,"Flapping wings of galliform birds are routinely used to produce aerodynamic forces oriented toward the substrate to enhance hindlimb traction. Here, I document this behavior in natural and laboratory settings. Adult birds fully capable of aerial flight preferentially employ wing-assisted incline running (WAIR), rather than flying, to reach elevated refuges (such as cliffs, trees, and boulders). From the day of hatching and before attaining sustained aerial flight, developing ground birds use WAIR to enhance their locomotor performance through improved foot traction, ultimately permitting vertical running. WAIR provides insight from behaviors observable in living birds into the possible role of incipient wings in feathered theropod dinosaurs and offers a previously unstudied explanation for the evolution of avian flight."
https://openalex.org/W2032045767,"In plants, cell-to-cell communication is mediated by plasmodesmata and involves the trafficking of non-cell-autonomous proteins (NCAPs). A component in this pathway, Nicotiana tabacum NON-CELL-AUTONOMOUS PATHWAY PROTEIN1 (NtNCAPP1), was affinity purified and cloned. Protein overlay assays and in vivo studies showed that NtNCAPP1 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum at the cell periphery and displays specificity in its interaction with NCAPs. Deletion of the NtNCAPP1 amino-terminal transmembrane domain produced a dominant-negative mutant that blocked the trafficking of specific NCAPs. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing this mutant form of NtNCAPP1 and plants in which the NtNCAPP1 gene was silenced were compromised in their ability to regulate leaf and floral development. These results support a model in which NCAP delivery to plasmodesmata is both selective and regulated."

G-protein coupled receptor regulator of G-protein signaling GTPase activating protein G-γ like multiplicity of infection nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid polyoxyethylene 10-lauryl ether Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) act as molecular switches in multiple GPCR1 signaling pathways via regulation of specific effector molecules such as phospholipase C and adenylyl cyclase. The biological activity of G-protein α-subunits is determined by the identity of the bound guanine nucleotide (GTP or GDP), which in turn is governed by the relative rates of guanine nucleotide exchange and hydrolysis of GTP by the intrinsic GTPase activity of Gα-subunits. These opposing reactions are stimulated by agonist-occupied GPCR and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Although some effector proteins exhibit GAP activity (1Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y.

This family is defined by a conserved RGS domain, which markedly increases the rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gα-subunits and terminates effector activation by both Gα- and Gβγ-subunits. More than 30 RGS proteins have been identified and organized into subfamilies based on sequence similarity and domain structure. These families vary in size and complexity, from the R4 family whose structure is largely limited to the RGS domain to the R12 and RhoGEF families whose members are large multifunctional proteins containing several domains (for reviews see Refs. 8Hepler J.R.

For example, RZ family members specifically accelerate GTPase activity of Gαz(18Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

The G-protein selectivity of the R7 family of RGS proteins has not been clearly defined. In single turnover GTPase assays, Gβ5/RGS6 and Gβ5/RGS7 increased GTPase activity of Gαo(20Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol.

Therefore, assays of soluble Gα-subunits suggest Gαo selectivity, while intact cell signaling studies implicate R7 proteins in regulation of Gq as well as Gi pathways. In face of the uncertainty of the actions of R7 RGS proteins, we purified the four members of the mammalian R7 family. The specificities of action of Gβ5/R7 heterodimers were determined in steady state GTPase assays of Gi and Gq family Gα-subunits reconstituted with GPCR in phospholipid vesicles. Gβ5/RGS6, -7, -9, and -11 increased the GTPase activity of Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 but not Gαq or Gα11. Notable differences in maximal GAP activities were observed among R7 family proteins, and the maximal activity of the most efficacious RGS protein (Gβ5/RGS11) was inhibited by Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9. The generation of baculoviruses for Gβ5, RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11 have been described previously (11Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G.

Cultures of Sf9 insect cells (1.4 × 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with virus encoding the RGS6, RGS7, or RGS9 gene (m.o.i. of 1) and a hexahistidine-tagged Gβ5 (short isoform) (m.o.i. of 0.5). Forty-eight hours postinfection, 4 liters of cells were collected by centrifugation. Due to lower expression under these conditions, Sf9 cells were infected with the RGS11:Gβ5 viruses at a 10:1 ratio (m.o.i. of 0.5 and 0.05), and cell lysates were obtained 65 h postinfection. Cells were resuspended and lysed in 600 ml of Buffer A (20 mm KPO4, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, protease inhibitors (500 nm aprotinin, 10 μmleupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 nm pepstatin, 10 μml-1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone)) with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer at 4 °C. The lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble protein fraction was loaded on a 3- to 5-ml column of Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen, Germany) over 3 h. The column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer B (20 mm KPO4, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors) followed by 5 ml of Buffer C (20 mm KPO4, pH 8, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors). The Gβ5/R7 dimers eluted with 50–150 mm imidazole in Buffer C. This eluate was further purified using 1 ml of HighTrap FPLC columns of either Q-Sepharose (Gβ5/RGS6 and Gβ5/RGS7) or S-Sepharose (Gβ5/RGS9 and Gβ5/RGS11) (AmershamBiosciences). The Ni-NTA eluate was diluted 5:1 in starting buffer for ion exchange chromatography (buffer for Q-Sepharose: 50 mmTris, pH 8, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors; buffer for S-Sepharose: 50 mm Hepes, pH 8, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors), loaded onto the FPLC column, and eluted in the same buffer with a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient over 30-column volumes. Each dimer eluted at ∼200 mm NaCl. Fractions were collected and concentrated using a Centricon centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, CT). The concentration of purified Gβ5/R7 dimers was determined by Coomassie staining purified product and a standard curve of protein standards resolved by SDS-PAGE. Yield was ∼1 mg of Gβ5/R7 dimer per 4 liters except for Gβ5/RGS11, whose purification yielded ∼250 μg per 4 liters. Gα- and Gβγ-subunits (24Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

Detergent/phospholipid mixed micelles were prepared by drying 110 μg of phosphatidylethanolamine, 70 μg of phosphatidylserine, and 8 nmol of cholesteryl hemisuccinate under argon and resuspending in detergent buffer (0.4% deoxycholate, 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). Fifty μl of this preparation was combined with 15 pmol of muscarinic receptor, 50 pmol of Gα, and 150 pmol of Gβ1γ2 in Buffer D (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmMgCl2) and immediately loaded onto a G-50-Sepharose column equilibrated with Buffer D. The eluate was collected in 200-μl fractions. Fractions were assayed for the presence of muscarinic receptor by incubation of 5 μl per fraction with 20 nm[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (∼200,000 cpm) in a volume of 100 μl for 90 min at 30 °C and filtration over GF/F filters (Whatman). Peak fractions also were assayed for Gα incorporation by incubation of 5 μl of the vesicle preparation with 1 μm35S-labeled GTPγS (500,000 cpm) in the presence or absence of 0.1% C12E10 detergent (total volume = 100 μl) at 30 °C for 90 min. Samples labeled in the absence of C12E10 were filtered over GF/F filters, which collect vesicles but not free protein, to quantitate incorporation of Gα-subunits into vesicles, and C12E10-containing samples were filtered over nitrocellulose to quantitate total Gα. One microliter (for Gαi/o-containing vesicles) or 5 μl (for Gαq/11-containing vesicles) of the vesicle preparations was equilibrated on ice in Buffer D in the presence or absence of 100 μm carbachol and various concentrations of RGS protein. [γ-32P]GTP (2 μm; ∼400,000 cpm) was added to each 25 μl of reaction. The reaction was transferred to a 30 °C water bath for 15 min (for Gαi/o-containing vesicles) or 30 min (for Gαq/11-containing vesicles) and quenched on ice with 975 ml of cold 5% activated charcoal in 20 mm NaH2PO4. The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation, and a portion of the supernatant was added to scintillant for 32Pi quantitation. The specificity of RGS proteins for G-protein substrates determines in part their physiological effects on signaling. Previousin vitro studies with Gα-subunits in solution have illustrated specificity of R7-RGS proteins for Gαo, whereas in vivo observations have suggested broader activities. To more specifically address the selectivity of individual Gβ5/R7 heterodimers for Gα-subunits, we purified Gβ5/RGS6, Gβ5/RGS7, Gβ5/RGS9, and Gβ5/RGS11 to near homogeneity and directly measured their selectivity in steady state GTPase assays with proteoliposomes reconstituted with M1 or M2 muscarinic receptors and various heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gq and Gifamilies, respectively. Full-length RGS6, -7, -9, and -11 were co-expressed with hexahistidine-tagged Gβ5 in Sf9 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system. Dimers were purified from the soluble fraction using Ni-NTA-agarose and ion exchange chromatography. Twenty-five to seventy-five percent of the total cellular immunoreactive R7 protein was recovered in the soluble fraction, 25–75% of the soluble protein was recovered following Ni-NTA chromatography, and nearly 100% of the Ni-NTA eluate was recovered following the final ion exchange purification. The results of a typical purification (Gβ5/RGS7) are shown in Fig.1 A. Purified Gβ5/RGS6, Gβ5/RGS9, and Gβ5/RGS11 dimers are illustrated in Fig.1 B. G-protein α-subunits (Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, Gαq, Gα11) were reconstituted in phospholipid vesicles with Gβ1γ2 and either M1 (Gq family G-proteins) or M2 (Gi family G-proteins) muscarinic receptors under conditions similar to those described by Ross and coworkers (26Pedersen S.E. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7228-7232Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27Asano T. Pedersen S.E. Scott C.W. Ross E.M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5460-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recovery of Gα-subunits and M1 or M2 muscarinic receptors in the various vesicle preparations was quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Essentially 100% of added Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3 was incorporated into vesicles, and receptor recovery in the proteoliposomes was ∼50%. We also prepared and resolved Gαo-containing vesicles using the higher exclusion limit Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration resin, which separates vesicles from free Gαo, and observed nearly all of the Gαo immunoreactivity co-migrating with vesicles in the void volume (data not shown). The four varieties of M2·Gαi/o vesicles contained similar Gα protein levels (∼100 fmol/μl) and receptor: Gα ratios (1:6) (data not shown). Quantitation of Gαq and Gα11 is difficult due to the low rates of guanine nucleotide turnover by these Gα-subunits. Therefore, calculations of GTPase activity reported below were made assuming that incorporation of Gαq/11into vesicles was equal to that of Gi family Gα-subunits. The GAP activity of Gβ5/R7 proteins toward Gα-subunits of the Gi and Gq families was assessed in steady state GTPase assays, which measure multiple rounds of GTP hydrolysis and, as such, reflect both guanine nucleotide exchange and GTPase activity. RGS4, an effective GAP against Gq and Gi family Gα-subunits (28Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a reference RGS protein in all experiments. Only minor increases were observed in the rate of GTP hydrolysis in the presence of either agonist (100 μmcarbachol) or GAP (200 nm RGS4) alone in proteoliposomes formed by reconstitution of M2 muscarinic receptor, Gαo, and Gβ1γ2 (Fig.2). In contrast, the combined presence of carbachol and RGS4 resulted in a markedly synergistic increase in GTPase activity, and the rate of hydrolysis of GTP was linear for at least 15 min. In the presence of a maximally effective concentration of RGS protein, guanine nucleotide exchange is rate-limiting, and therefore stimulation of GTPase activity by carbachol was observed with a concentration dependence of agonist that approximated its occupancy curve for binding to the M2 muscarinic receptor (data not shown). Similarly, in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of carbachol, guanine nucleotide exchange was no longer rate-limiting, and marked concentration-dependent stimulation of GTPase was observed with RGS4 (data not shown) and Gβ5/R7 RGS proteins (see below). To compare the capacity of Gβ5/R7 proteins to accelerate GTPase rates of Gi family Gα-subunits, steady state GTPase activities were determined in the presence and absence of 100 μm carbachol and in the presence and absence of 1 μm RGS protein (either RGS4 or each Gβ5/R7 dimer). RGS4 markedly increased GTPase activity for Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 in the presence of 100 μm carbachol (Fig.3). Each of the Gβ5/R7 dimers also stimulated to varying degrees GTP hydrolysis by Gαo, Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 in the presence of agonist (Fig. 3 and TableI). The rate observed with Gβ5/RGS11 was as high or higher than the rate with RGS4 with all four Gi family Gα-subunits, while the GTPase rates in the presence of 1 μm Gβ5/RGS6, Gβ5/RGS7, and Gβ5/RGS9 were significantly lower. Vesicles containing Gαo achieved the highest maximal GTPase rates irrespective of the RGS protein. However, the basal rate of GTP hydrolysis by Gαo in the absence of RGS protein was also higher than that observed in GαI-containing vesicles. Thus, the fold increase in activity (GTPase rate in the presence of RGS and agonist divided by the GTPase rate with agonist alone) of Gαi3 was as high or higher than that of Gαo in response to Gβ5/RGS6, -7, -9, and -11 stimulation. Further, the effects of R7 proteins on GTPase activity of Gαo-subunits reconstituted with purified P2Y12 receptors was also determined (in the presence of the agonist 2-methylthio ADP). Similar to the results observed with M2 receptor-coupled G-proteins, each of the Gβ5/RGS11 dimers stimulated steady state GTPase activity of Gαo, and Gβ5/RGS11 stimulated much higher GTPase rates than the other R7 proteins (data not shown).Table IGTPase rates of Gi family Gα-subunits in the presence of RGS4 and Gβ5/R7 proteinsGβ5/RGS6Gβ5/RGS7Gβ5/RGS9Gβ5/RGS11RGS4Gαo8.97 ± 0.156.10 ± 0.165.56 ± 0.0210.61 ± 0.088.59 ± 0.05Gαi11.86 ± 0.171.44 ± 0.061.16 ± 0.014.82 ± 0.084.92 ± 0.35Gαi21.75 ± 0.011.79 ± 0.261.28 ± 0.014.81 ± 0.142.88 ± 0.02Gαi33.39 ± 0.162.69 ± 0.062.26 ± 0.067.02 ± 0.098.06 ± 0.14GTPase rates (min−1) attained in the presence of 100 μm carbachol and 1 μm RGS protein are shown with mean ± S.D. Open table in a new tab GTPase rates (min−1) attained in the presence of 100 μm carbachol and 1 μm RGS protein are shown with mean ± S.D. Regulation of GTPase activities of Gαq and Gα11 was examined in vesicles reconstituted with M1 muscarinic receptor and heterotrimeric G-proteins (Fig. 4). RGS4 increased steady state GTPase activity of Gαq and Gα11 in the presence of agonist by nearly 5-fold to final GTPase rates of ∼200 fmol of GTP/min/pmol of Gα. Consistent with previous observations of guanine nucleotide exchange/GTPase kinetics of Gq (29Chidiac P. Markin V.S. Ross E.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), these rates are lower than those observed for Gi family α-subunits. In contrast to the activity of RGS4, none of the Gβ5/R7 dimers significantly increased steady state GTPase activity of Gαq or Gα11 in the presence of carbachol (Fig. 4 A). Likewise, Gβ5/R7 dimers did not stimulate GTPase activity of Gαq- or Gα11-subunits reconstituted with purified P2Y1 receptors (in the presence of the agonist 2-methylthio ADP) (data not shown). Further, 1 μm Gβ5/R7 dimers had no effect on the GTPase activity of M1 receptor-coupled Gαq and Gα11 stimulated by RGS4 and carbachol (Fig.4 B). The partial inhibition observed with Gβ5/RGS11 was nonspecific as demonstrated by equivalent inhibitory activity observed with boiled Gβ5/RGS11. Therefore, under the conditions of these assays, R7 proteins neither stimulate GTPase activity of Gαq or Gα11nor affect GTPase activity stimulated by agonist and RGS4. To more fully elucidate any selectivity of Gβ5/R7 proteins as GAPs for Gi family subunits, full concentration effect curves of each Gβ5/R7 protein were generated in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of carbachol. Consistent with the data in Fig. 3, maximally effective concentrations of Gβ5/RGS11 produced larger effects than Gβ5/RGS7, Gβ5/RGS6, and Gβ5/RGS9 on the GTPase activity of each Gα-subunit (Fig. 5 and data not shown), and the highest maximal rate observed with each RGS protein was observed with Gαo as substrate (not shown). Each of the Gβ5/RGS dimers produced a near maximal effect at a concentration of 1 μm, and therefore each activation curve was normalized to 100% of maximal activity for comparison of EC50 values (Fig. 6). All four Gβ5/R7 dimers exhibited similar potency for Gαo (EC50 = 16–47 nm), while Gβ5/RGS9 and Gβ5/RGS11 were more potent (EC50 = 25–80 nm) than Gβ5/RGS6 and Gβ5/RGS7 (EC50 = 150–350 nm) for Gαi1, Gαi2, and Gαi3 (Table II).Figure 6Gβ5/R7 proteins exhibit differences in potency toward Gi family Gα-subunits. Steady state GTPase rates were determined for M2·Gαi/o·Gβ1γ2 vesicles in the presence of 100 μm carbachol and various concentrations of R7 proteins to generate concentration effect curves. Data are normalized to 100% activity for comparison of EC50 values. Symbols are Gβ5/RGS11 (♦), Gβ5/RGS9 (●), Gβ5/RGS7 (▾), and Gβ5/RGS6 (▪).

Open table in a new tab The mean ± S.D. of EC50 values (nm) are shown from three independent determinations of the concentration effect relationship of the R7 proteins as GAPs of Gi family Gα-subunits using three different vesicle preparations. Marked differences in the maximal GTPase rate of Gα-subunits were observed across the Gβ5/R7 protein family. For example, Gβ5/RGS11-stimulated GTPase activity of Gαo was twice that achieved in the presence of Gβ5/RGS9 or Gβ5/RGS7. These results suggest that Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9 interaction with G-proteins results in a less active Gα conformation with respect to GTPase activity than that promoted by Gβ5/RGS11 interaction. To test this hypothesis, steady state GTPase activity of M2·Gαo·β1γ2 vesicles was measured in the presence of 100 nm Gβ5/RGS11 or 1 μm Gβ5/RGS7 alone or with 100 nm Gβ5/RGS11 plus 1 μmGβ5/RGS7. As illustrated in Fig.7 A, GTPase activity in the presence of Gβ5/RGS11 was nearly twice that observed with a 10-fold higher concentration of Gβ5/RGS7. However, the combined presence of 1 μm Gβ5/RGS7 and 100 nm Gβ5/RGS11 resulted in activity only slightly greater than that of Gβ5/RGS7 alone, suggesting that Gβ5/RGS7 competitively antagonizes the action of the more efficacious Gβ5/RGS11. Heat-inactivated Gβ5/RGS7 neither stimulated GTPase activity nor inhibited the stimulatory effect of Gβ5/RGS11 on GTPase activity (Fig. 7 A), demonstrating that both effects of Gβ5/RGS7 are dependent on protein activity. To further characterize the interaction of RGS proteins and Gαo, the concentration dependence of the inhibitory effect of Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9 was determined by varying the concentrations of these proteins in the presence of carbachol and 100 nm Gβ5/RGS11. Both Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9 significantly inhibited Gβ5/RGS11-stimulated GTPase activity of M2·Gαo vesicles with IC50 values of 100–200 nm (Fig. 7 B). These data indicate that while Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9 are less efficacious activators of GTPase activity, they interact with a similar region of Gαo as does Gβ5/RGS11. The results of this study demonstrate Gαi/ospecificity of Gβ5/R7 proteins and found no evidence of regulation of Gαq GTPase activity by these proteins. Further, we demonstrated that differences exist in the potencies and relative efficacies of the Gβ5/R7 proteins for their Gαi/o substrates. Finally, we illustrated that Gβ5/RGS7 and Gβ5/RGS9, which are less effective promoters of maximal GTPase activity than is Gβ5/RGS11, inhibit Gβ5/RGS11-stimulated GTPase activity of Gαo. The drug selectivity of G-protein-coupled receptors has been widely exploited therapeutically to manipulate specific cellular processes (30Capuano B. Crosby I.T. Lloyd E.J. Curr. Med.

https://openalex.org/W2077931118,"Large-scale, electric currents flowing along magnetic field lines into the polar regions of Earth are thought to be the main contributors of the energy that powers the ionospheric aurora. However, we have found evidence for global contributions from electromagnetic waves (Alfvén waves). Data that were collected from the Polar spacecraft over the course of 1 year show that the flow of wave electromagnetic energy at altitudes of 25,000 to 38,000 kilometers delineates the statistical auroral oval. The Poynting flux of individual events distributed along the auroral oval was larger than 5 ergs per square centimeter per second, which is sufficient to power auroral acceleration processes. This evidence suggests that in addition to magnetic field-aligned currents, the dayside and nightside aurora is globally powered by the energy flow of these high-altitude Alfvén waves."

Stellar-mass black holes with beamed radiation and intermediate black holes with isotropic radiation are two plausible explanations. We discovered radio emission from an ultraluminous x-ray source in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 5408. The x-ray, radio, and optical fluxes as well as the x-ray spectral shape are consistent with beamed relativistic jet emission from an accreting stellar black hole. If confirmed, this would suggest that the ultraluminous x-ray sources may be stellar-mass rather than intermediate-mass black holes. However, interpretation of the source as a jet-producing intermediate-mass black hole cannot be ruled out at this time."

The RICS-β-catenin complex was found to be associated with N-cadherin,N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, and postsynaptic density-95, and localized to the postsynaptic density.

Biol. 1986; 2: 373-388Google Scholar). Some members of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins are localized to synaptic junctions and have been implicated in synaptic plasticity (14Uchida N.

For example, inhibitory antibodies to the first extracellular domain of N-cadherin, one of the classical cadherins enriched in neural cells, have been shown to attenuate the induction of LTP (16Tang L.

Also, antagonistic peptides containing the consensus sequence for cadherin dimer formation prevent the induction of LTP (16Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1165-1175Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of cadherin activity by a dominant-negative N-cadherin, as well as by mutation of αN-catenin, has been shown to alter dendritic spine morphology (18Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 77-89Google Scholar), suggesting that cadherins function as regulators of synaptic plasticity by modulating spine morphology.β-Catenin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins and links cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton (19Ozawa M.

Tanaka H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6892-6904Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported recently (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar) that neural activity induces redistribution of β-catenin from dendritic shafts into spines, where it interacts with cadherin to influence synaptic size and strength.N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which play a central role in synaptic plasticity, are heteromeric ion channels consisting of essential NR1 subunits and one or more of the modulatory NR2 subunits, NR2A-D (22Kutsuwada T.

Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Google Scholar, 30Scannevin R.H. Huganir R.L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 133-141Google Scholar, 31Sheng M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1251Google Scholar, 32Sheng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7058-7061Google Scholar, 33Hering H. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 880-888Google Scholar). β-Catenin is also known to be localized in PSD as a component of the NMDA receptor multiprotein complex (12Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar). Furthermore, the β-catenin redistribution induced by depolarization is completely blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, indicating that the redistribution is caused by synaptic activation of NMDA receptors (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar). Also it has been reported that stimulation of NMDA receptors by the agonist NMDA induces molecular modification of N-cadherin, i.e. increased trypsin resistance, as well as pronounced dimerization of N-cadherin (7Tanaka H. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Bozdagi O. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 2000; 25: 93-107Google Scholar). Thus, β-catenin and N-cadherin are structurally and functionally linked to NMDA receptors.To further elucidate the role of β-catenin in synaptic function, we attempted to identify novel binding partners of β-catenin. In the present study, we show that β-catenin interacts with a novel GTPase-activating protein for Cdc42 and Rac1, termed RICS (RhoGAP involved in the β-catenin-N-cadherin and NMDA receptorsignaling). RICS was found to localize to the PSD and to be associated with N-cadherin, PSD-95, and NMDA-R, in addition to β-catenin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that its GAP activity is down-regulated through phosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), a kinase critical for synaptic plasticity that is activated by NMDA receptor-mediated influx of Ca2+ (34Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that β-catenin interacts with RICS via armadillo repeats 10–12. Furthermore, we showed that RICS is enriched in the PSD fraction and coimmunoprecipitates with N-cadherin, PSD-95, and NMDA receptors from the PSD of mouse brain. Consistent with this result, RICS, PSD-95, and NMDA receptors colocalized at the synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons. In addition, in vitro pull-down assays showed that in vitro translated RICS weakly interacts with NR2A/2B and PSD-95 but not with NR1 (data not shown). Although these weak interactions were reproducibly detected in our experimental conditions, we do not know whether these interactions are physiologically important. In any case, these results suggest that RICS, β-catenin, N-cadherin, PSD-95, and NMDA receptors are contained within the same complex in vivo. The PSD-95 family of proteins interacts with various proteins, including DAP (hDLG-associated protein)/SAPAP (synapse-associated protein 90-associated protein)/GKAP (guanylate kinase-associated protein) (43Satoh K.

Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Google Scholar). Thus, RICS may be contained in a multicomponent complex consisting of adhesion proteins, NMDA receptors, and other various structural and signaling molecules.We demonstrated that RICS possesses GAP activity for Ccd42 and Rac1. This result is consistent with the observation that the GAP domain of RICS is highly homologous to that of CdGAP, which also possesses GAP activity for Cdc42 and Rac1 (35Lamarche-Vane N. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29172-29177Google Scholar). The Rho GTPases regulate the actin cytoskeleton (55Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 56Machesky L.M. Insall R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 267-272Google Scholar) and play an important role in the maintenance and reorganization of dendritic spines (57Ziv N.E. Smith S.J. Neuron. 1996; 17: 91-102Google Scholar, 58Luo L. Hensch T.K. Ackerman L. Barbel S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Nature. 1996; 379: 837-840Google Scholar). Rac1 is required for the maintenance of dendritic spines, whereas elevation of RhoA activity leads to pronounced simplification of dendritic branch patterns (59Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Google Scholar). Furthermore, Karilin-7, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac1, has been reported to be a regulator of the postsynaptic actin cytoskeleton (51Penzes P. Johnson R.C. Sattler R. Zhang X. Huganir R.L. Kambampati V. Mains R.E. Eipper B.A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 229-242Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been reported that overexpression of either an active or dominant-negative form of Cdc42 does not induce significant changes in the maintenance of spine density or morphology (60Tashiro A. Minden A. Yuste R. Cereb. Cortex. 2000; 10: 927-938Google Scholar). Thus, RICS may be involved in the maintenance and reorganization of dendritic spines through its GAP activity toward Rac1.It has been shown that NMDA receptor signaling influences dendritic branching, and this regulation involves Rho GTPases that are contained in the NMDA receptor complex (61Li Z. Van Aelst L. Cline H.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 217-225Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that PSD-95 is involved in regulating spine structure and number; overexpression of PSD-95 in cultured hippocampus neurons leads to increases in the size and number of dendritic spines (62El-Husseini A.E. Schnell E. Chetkovich D.M. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. Science. 2000; 290: 1364-1368Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the fact that RICS is contained in the NMDA receptor-PSD-95 complex raises the possibility that activation of NMDA receptors leads to RICS-mediated regulation of Rho GTPase. In this regard, it is interesting that RICS was found to be a substrate for CaMKII, and its GAP activity is inhibited by phosphorylation by CaMKII.CaMKII is highly concentrated in the PSD and plays a key role in LTP (34Lisman J. Schulman H. Cline H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 175-190Google Scholar, 63Malinow R. Schulman H. Tsien R.W. Science. 1989; 245: 862-866Google Scholar, 64Silva A.J. Paylor R. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Science. 1992; 257: 206-211Google Scholar, 65Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Google Scholar, 66Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 687-693Google Scholar, 67Hinds H.L. Tonegawa S. Malinow R. Learn. Mem. 1998; 5: 344-354Google Scholar). CaMKII is activated following Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptors during LTP induction and potentiates synaptic efficacy (68Pettit D.L. Perlman S. Malinow R. Science. 1994; 266: 1881-1885Google Scholar, 69Giese K.P. Fedorov N.B. Filipkowski R.K. Silva A.J. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Google Scholar, 70Ouyang Y. Kantor D. Harris K.M. Schuman E.M. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5416-5427Google Scholar). Stimulation by Ca2+/calmodulin induces binding of CaMKII to the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminus of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B (71Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Google Scholar, 72Strack S. Colbran R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20689-20692Google Scholar, 73Leonard A.S. Lim I.A. Hemsworth D.E. Horne M.C. Hell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3239-3244Google Scholar), and the interaction with NR2B locks CaMKII into an active conformation (74Bayer K.U. De Koninck P. Leonard A.S. Hell J.W. Schulman H. Nature. 2001; 411: 801-805Google Scholar). Hence, it is interesting to speculate that CaMKII activated by Ca2+ entry through NMDA receptors inactivates RICS, which in turn increases the active GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac1. This would thereby induce, for example, remodeling of dendritic spines. Thus, RICS may play a role in the NMDA receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway and be involved in the regulation of synaptic plasticity.The adhesion proteins are not simply basic structural scaffolds that hold the synapse and its components together. For example, N-cadherin distribution can be dynamically regulated by neuronal activity, in a manner requiring the NMDA receptors (7Tanaka H. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Bozdagi O. Shapiro L. Huntley G.W. Benson D.L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 2000; 25: 93-107Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the function of N-cadherin is to transiently change spine morphology. Indeed, inhibition of cadherin activity has been shown recently (18Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 77-89Google Scholar) to alter dendritic spine morphology, suggesting that cadherins function as regulators of synaptic plasticity by modulating this morphology. On the other hand, it has been reported that cadherin-mediated junction formation activates Rac1 (75Nakagawa M. Fukata M. Yamaga M. Itoh N. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1829-1838Google Scholar) and that Rac1 is required for the maintenance of dendritic spines (59Nakayama A.Y. Harms M.B. Luo L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5329-5338Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that the cadherin system regulates spine morphology by regulating Rho GTPases. Hence, it is possible that RICS contained in the N-cadherin-β-catenin complex is involved in N-cadherin-mediated regulation of spine morphology.It has been reported recently (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar) that neural activity induces redistribution of β-catenin from dendritic shafts into spines and increases its association with cadherins, thereby promoting changes in synaptic structure and function (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar). Thus, it would be interesting to determine whether RICS is also induced to redistribute together with β-catenin into spines or if RICS associates with redistributed β-catenin in the PSD. The redistribution of β-catenin is mimicked or prevented, respectively, by a tyrosine kinase or phosphatase inhibitor (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar). Furthermore, Murase et al. (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar) demonstrated that a point mutation in β-catenin Tyr-654 alters spine-shaft distribution; a mutant β-catenin, in which Tyr-654 is replaced with Phe, thereby abrogating phosphorylation, is concentrated in spines, whereas a mutant β-catenin, in which Tyr-654 is replaced with Glu to mimic phosphorylation, accumulates in dendritic shafts. Interestingly, RICS interacts with the armadillo repeats 10–12 of β-catenin and Tyr-654 resides in armadillo repeat 12. It would therefore be interesting to examine whether phosphorylation of β-catenin Tyr-654 regulates its interaction with RICS.In conclusion, our results suggest that RICS is involved in the synaptic adhesion- and NMDA receptor-mediated organization of cytoskeletal networks and signal transduction. We speculate that RICS may regulate dendritic spine morphology and strength by regulating Cdc42 and Rac1.During the revision of this paper, Nakamura et al. (79Nakamura T. Komiya M. Sone K. Hirose E. Gotoh N. Morii H. Ohta Y. Mori N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8721-8734Google Scholar) and Moon et al. (80Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4151-4159Google Scholar) reported the identification of Grit and p200RhoGAP, respectively, which are identical to RICS. Nakamuraet al. (79Nakamura T. Komiya M. Sone K. Hirose E. Gotoh N. Morii H. Ohta Y. Mori N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8721-8734Google Scholar) have shown that Grit may regulate neurite extension through association with the TrkA receptor and N-Shc and CrkL/Crk adapter molecules. Moon et al. (80Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4151-4159Google Scholar) have demonstrated that p200RhoGAP may be involved in the regulation of neurite outgrowth, and its activity may be regulated through an interaction with Src-like tyrosine kinases. It has been shown that Grit prefers RhoA and Cdc42 to Rac1 whereas p200RhoGAP prefers RhoA and Rac1. Discrepancies between three papers (Refs. 79Nakamura T. Komiya M. Sone K. Hirose E. Gotoh N. Morii H. Ohta Y. Mori N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8721-8734Google Scholar and 80Moon S.Y. Zang H. Zheng T. J. Biol.

Many studies have revealed that synaptic remodeling and plastic changes in dendritic spine morphology play a role in synaptic plasticity (1Engert F. Bonhoeffer T.

Furthermore, changes in synaptic strength have been shown to involve the structural and functional modifications of the molecules present in the postsynaptic density (PSD) (7Tanaka H. Shan W.

Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar). The cadherins are a family of single-pass transmembrane proteins that mediate Ca2+-dependent, homophilic intercellular adhesion (13Takeichi M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 2: 373-388Google Scholar). Some members of the cadherin family of adhesion proteins are localized to synaptic junctions and have been implicated in synaptic plasticity (14Uchida N. Honjo Y. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 767-779Google Scholar, 15Murase S. Schuman E.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 549-553Google Scholar). For example, inhibitory antibodies to the first extracellular domain of N-cadherin, one of the classical cadherins enriched in neural cells, have been shown to attenuate the induction of LTP (16Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1165-1175Google Scholar, 17Bozdagi O. Shan W. Tanaka H. Benson D.L. Huntley G.W. Neuron. 2000; 28: 245-259Google Scholar). Also, antagonistic peptides containing the consensus sequence for cadherin dimer formation prevent the induction of LTP (16Tang L. Hung C.P. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1165-1175Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of cadherin activity by a dominant-negative N-cadherin, as well as by mutation of αN-catenin, has been shown to alter dendritic spine morphology (18Togashi H. Abe K. Mizoguchi A. Takaoka K. Chisaka O. Takeichi M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 77-89Google Scholar), suggesting that cadherins function as regulators of synaptic plasticity by modulating spine morphology. β-Catenin interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of classical cadherins and links cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton (19Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Google Scholar, 20Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Google Scholar). β-Catenin and N-cadherin are present in axons and dendrites prior to synapse formation and then cluster at developing synapses and form a symmetrical adhesion structure in synaptic junctions (21Benson D.L. Tanaka H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6892-6904Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported recently (10Murase S.M. Mosser E. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 2002; 35: 91-105Google Scholar) that neural activity induces redistribution of β-catenin from dendritic shafts into spines, where it interacts with cadherin to influence synaptic size and strength. N-Methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which play a central role in synaptic plasticity, are heteromeric ion channels consisting of essential NR1 subunits and one or more of the modulatory NR2 subunits, NR2A-D (22Kutsuwada T.

The NMDA receptors are associated with the PSD-95 family of proteins, the most abundant constituents of PSD, via its NR2 subunits (25Kornau H.C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

This interaction is important for specific localization of NMDA receptors in the PSD and its coupling to cytoskeletal networks and signaling molecules (29Kennedy M.B.

Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Google Scholar). Furthermore, the β-catenin redistribution induced by depolarization is completely blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists, indicating that the redistribution is caused by synaptic activation of NMDA receptors (10Murase S.M.

https://openalex.org/W2065952082,"Tiam1 is a ubiquitous guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the Rac GTPase. We have shown previously that the N terminus of Tiam1 contributes to the signaling specificity of its downstream target Rac via association with IB2, a scaffold that promotes Rac activation of a p38 kinase cascade. Here we show that the N terminus of Tiam1 can influence Rac signaling specificity in a different way by interaction with spinophilin, a scaffold that binds to p70 S6 kinase, another protein regulated by Rac. In particular, spinophilin binding promotes the plasma membrane localization of Tiam1 and enhances the ability of Tiam1 to activate p70 S6 kinase. In contrast, spinophilin binding suppresses the ability of Tiam to activate Pak1, a different Rac effector. Finally, a mutant spinophilin that cannot bind to Tiam1 suppresses serum-induced p70 S6 kinase activation in cells, suggesting that a Tiam1/spinophilin complex contributes to p70 S6 kinase regulation by extracellular signals. These findings add to a growing body of evidence supporting the concept that some Rac-GEFs not only activate Rac GTPases but also participate in the selection of Rac effector by binding to particular scaffolds that complex with components of specific Rac effector pathways.

The Rac GTPase participates in multiple cellular functions, including cell motility and adhesion, cell survival, proliferation and apoptosis, and generation of reactive oxygen species (1Nobes C.D. Hall A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 2Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Activated Rac influences diverse signaling pathways, including those governing movements of the actin cytoskeleton, activation of transcription factors, and regulation of the NADPH oxidase complex. GTP-bound Rac mediates these multiple functions through interaction with a host of downstream effector proteins, including p65 Pak, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, IQ GAP, p67 phox, POR1, p70 S6 kinase, STAT3, POSH, and MLK3. 1The abbreviations used are: MLK3, mixed lineage kinase 3; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; CC, coiled coil; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKK3, MAP kinase kinase 3; HA, hemagglutinin A; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; S6K1, p70 S6 kinase; IQ, calmodulin-binding domain; N543, N-terminal 543 amino acids of spinophilin.1The abbreviations used are: MLK3, mixed lineage kinase 3; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; CC, coiled coil; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MKK3, MAP kinase kinase 3; HA, hemagglutinin A; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; S6K1, p70 S6 kinase; IQ, calmodulin-binding domain; N543, N-terminal 543 amino acids of spinophilin.Activation of the Rac GTPase occurs through the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, catalyzed by one of multiple Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rac-GEFs). Rac-GEFs all contain similar catalytic Dbl homology (DH) domains adjacent to pleckstrin homology (PH) domains but differ in their tissue distribution and activation by distinct upstream signals (3Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Tiam1 is a ubiquitously expressed Rac-GEF. It promotes invasion in lymphocytes and fibroblasts, adhesion in epithelial cells, regulation of axon formation at neuronal growth cones, and induction of apoptosis in a human leukemia cell line (4Habets G.G.

In a breast cancer cell line, ectopic Tiam1 potentiated β-catenin-dependent TCF/LEF1 transactivation and heregulin-induced invasiveness (9Adam L. Vadlamudi R.K. McCrea P. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28443-28450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Conversely, in a renal cell carcinoma line Tiam1 promoted adhesion and inhibited invasion through at least two distinct downstream pathways (10Engers R. Springer E. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Gabbert H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41889-41897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A Tiam1 knockout mouse was relatively resistant to chemical induction of skin tumors but paradoxically more prone to malignant histologic progression of those tumors (11Malliri A. van der Kammen R.A. Clark K. van der Valk M. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Nature. 2002; 417: 867-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In cell-based assays, the myriad effects of Tiam1 are dependent on its ability to activate Rac.The cellular signals that enhance Tiam1 activation of Rac are beginning to be defined. Tiam1 is phosphorylated on threonine via the actions of CamKII and protein kinase C in response to agonist stimulation, but only CaMKII-induced phosphorylation promotes a modest increase in the intrinsic GEF activity of the protein (10Engers R. Springer E. Michiels F. Collard J.G. Gabbert H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41889-41897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Fleming I.N. Elliott C.M. Buchanan F.G. Downes C.P. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12753-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The binding of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase lipid products similarly enhances exchange activity of Tiam1 (13Fleming I.N. Gray A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation through protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) leads to the inhibition of Tiam1 exchange activity. Factors that govern Tiam1 targeting, rather than exchange activity, may also be important for determining the ultimate outcome of Tiam1 activation of Rac, but these mechanisms are poorly understood.Recent evidence suggests that some Rac-GEFs influence Rac GTPase signaling specificity in addition to promoting their activation. The first hint of this concept came from the observation that, although different Rac-GEFs stimulated similar levels of Rac-GTP in cells, they produced different cellular responses (14Zhou K. Wang Y. Gorski J.L. Nomura N. Collard J. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16782-16786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). One possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that individual Rac-GEFs participate in the selection of specific Rac effector proteins for activation. PIX/COOL is one example of this process because it binds directly to a specific Rac effector protein, Pak1 (15Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 16Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol.

Commun. 2000; 272: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Another example is Tiam1, which contains N-terminal domains that participate in protein-protein interactions that may mediate both the responses to extracellular signals and the selection of Rac targets. Near the N terminus of Tiam1 are an adjoining PH domain, the coiled-coil (CC) domain, and an undefined region termed Ex. These domains function cooperatively in targeting Tiam1 to the plasma membrane and are required for Tiam1-induced membrane ruffling (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 19Michiels F. Stam J.C.

Ras-GRF1, a dual exchange factor for both Ras and Rac, possesses a similar cluster of domains at its N terminus that also have a role in protein targeting and calcium activation of the protein (20Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We have recently found that Tiam1 and Ras-GRF1 bind to the scaffold protein IB2/JIP2 through these same N-terminal domains (21Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This provides for a mechanism for Rac signaling specificity, because IB2/JIP2 is bound to the Rac effector, MLK3, and its downstream target kinases, MKK3 and p38 MAP kinase. In fact, binding of IB2/JIP to Tiam1 or Ras-GRF1 promotes activation of the p38 MAP kinase cascade.Here we show that Tiam1 and Ras-GRF1 also interact through this same N-terminal domain cluster with a different scaffold protein, spinophilin (also known as neurabin II). A ubiquitously expressed protein, spinophilin binds PP1 and is thought to serve as a targeting device for the phosphatase (22Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9956-9961Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Spinophilin is also an actin-binding protein and has been shown to bind to a subset of actin filaments involved in Rac-mediated actin reorganization (23Satoh A. Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Wada M. Takahashi K. Satoh K. Hirao K. Nishioka H. Hata Y. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3470-3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 24Stephens D.J. Banting G. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Importantly, spinophilin and its close relative, neurabin I (25Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), have also been shown to bind to p70 S6 kinase, another protein dependent upon Rac activity. S6 kinase plays a key role in cell growth through regulating the initiation of protein translation (26Avruch J. Belham C. Weng Q. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2001; 26: 115-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We show that interaction with spinophilin leads to localization of Tiam1 at the plasma membrane. We also show that spinophilin enhances the activation of p70 S6 kinase by Tiam1. Importantly, the interaction of Tiam1 with spinophilin influences Rac GTPase signaling specificity by promoting the activation of p70 S6 kinase over other Rac effectors in cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSYeast Two-hybrid Assay—A partial rat spinophilin cDNA clone was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid method in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain Y190). The bait plasmid was constructed by insertion of sequences encoding amino acids 431–670 of Tiam1 cDNA (spanning the N-terminal PH, CC, and Ex domains) in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in the pAS-Cyh vector. Bait DNA was co-transfected into yeast along with a commercial rat brain cDNA library cloned in-frame with the Gal4 DNA activation domain in the pGAD10 vector (Clontech). DNAs from colonies growing under dual selection conditions that also showed histidine auxotrophy and expressed β-galactosidase were retested as above to confirm the yeast interaction and then sequenced.Plasmids—Plasmids encoding cDNAs for HA-Tiam C-1199, ΔPCX-Tiam-1, oncogenic Dbl, pEBG-JNK, Myc-Pak, and Ras-GRF1 have been described previously (21Buchsbaum R.J. Connolly B.A. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4073-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GFP and GFP-spinophilin were kindly provided by S. Milgram. Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged p70 S6 kinase and GST-S6 peptide were kindly provided by J. Blenis. The plasmid encoding the GST-Pak3 Rac-binding domain was a kind gift of R. Cerione. The plasmid encoding the N-terminal 543 amino acids of spinophilin as a GFP fusion (GFP-spinophilin-N543) was engineered using BamH1 digestion of pEGFP-spinophilin.Antibodies and Immunoblotting—Antibodies to Tiam1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RasGRF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Dbl (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HA-epitope tag (Covance), Myc-epitope (Santa Cruz), FLAG-epitope (Sigma), Rac (Upstate Biotechnology), and spinophilin (Upstate Biotechnology) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Secondary antibodies, immunoblotting, and chemiluminescence protocol for developing blots have been described previously (20Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S.D. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum (Hyclone) in an incubator with humidified air (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells were grown as above in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). NIH3T3 cells were grown as above in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone). Cells were plated in 60-mm plastic dishes, and transient transfections were performed using DEAE-Dextran (COS7), calcium phosphate precipitation (HEK293T), or LipofectAMINE 2000 (NIH3T3) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. When indicated, cells were deprived of serum for 16 h prior to harvest.Immunoprecipitations—Transfected cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed in immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH.8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (50 μm sodium fluoride and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were cleared of unbroken cells and debris by 10,000 × g centrifugation for 10 min. Cleared lysates were incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and the appropriate antibody (diluted according to manufacturer's instructions) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Aliquots of cleared lysate were retained prior to immunoprecipitation for immunoblotting. After washing three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, bound proteins were eluted in 4× Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. For detection of the interaction between endogenous proteins, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol, and the inhibitors described above.Immunofluorescence—The day after transfection, COS7 cells were replated onto coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine. Cells were deprived of serum for 16 h prior to fixation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were blocked and permeabilized with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100. Anti-Tiam antibody and anti-rabbit Cy3 conjugate were diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were washed with PBS between each step; after the final washing, coverslips were mounted using 50% glycerol in PBS. Fluorescing proteins were visualized using a confocal fluorescence microscope.Rac-GTP Pull-down Assay—Transfected cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed in buffer C (50 mm Tris HCl, pH7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 120 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. Cleared lysates containing equivalent amounts of total protein were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with S-hexyl-glutathione-agarose beads loaded with the p21-binding domain of PAK1 expressed as a GST fusion in Escherichia Coli, as described (27Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). After incubation, precipitates were washed once with buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and twice with buffer D without detergent. Bound proteins were eluted in 4× Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted.S6 Kinase Activation—Transfected cells were washed with cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed in cell lysis buffer (10 mm KPO4/1 mm EDTA, pH 7.05, 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2,50mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Brij-35, and 0.1% deoxycholate, pH 7.28) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. FLAG or HA immunoprecipitates from cleared lysates were washed once in ice-cold buffer A (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% NaDOC, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA), once in high salt buffer (1.0 m NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2), and once in ice-cold ST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.2). Kinase reactions proceeded for 10 min at 30 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25 μm ATP with 5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of purified GST-S6 peptide per reaction, as described (28Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped with the addition of Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized with Coomassie stain, dried, and quantified on a PhosphorImager. All cells were deprived of serum for 16 h prior to harvest and re-stimulated where indicated.Pak Activation—Transfected cells were washed with cold PBS, pelleted, and lysed in buffer M (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 125 mm NaCl) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors as above. MYC immunoprecipitates from cleared lysates were washed three times in ice-cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and one time with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2). Kinase reactions proceeded for 15 min at room temperature in kinase buffer containing 1 μm dithiothreitol, 25 μm ATP, and 50 μg/ml myelin basic protein. Reactions were stopped with the addition of Laemmli buffer and processed as above.JNK Activation—Transfected cells were processed as for Pak assays except that the cells were deprived of serum prior to harvest, the expressed JNK was immobilized on S-hexyl-glutathione beads, and kinase reactions included 50 μg/ml GST-Jun as substrate.RESULTSTiam1 Interacts with Spinophilin—The N-terminal PH, CC, and Ex domains of Tiam1 function to localize and regulate the exchange factor properly in cells (19Michiels F. Stam J.C. Hordijk P.L. van der Kammen R.A. Ruuls-Van Stalle L. Feltkamp C.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that might regulate the exchange factor through interaction with these domains. A cDNA identified this way included DNA sequences spanning amino acids 444–817 of spinophilin (also called Neurabin II), a scaffold protein known to bind actin, PP1, and p70 S6 kinase (S6K1). The domain structures of both Tiam1 and spinophilin are depicted in Fig. 1, A and B, with the interacting Tiam1 and spinophilin regions defined by the two-hybrid screen as noted by the heavy black bars.To confirm that Tiam1 can bind to spinophilin in cells, endogenous Tiam1 from COS7 cells was immunoprecipitated, and then the sample was immunoblotted with anti-spinophilin antibodies. As a control, non-immune IgG was used instead of Tiam1 antibodies. Fig 2A shows spinophilin in the experimental but not control immunoprecipitation, indicating that at least a fraction of the two proteins do in fact interact in cells.Fig. 2Tiam1 and spinophilin interact in cells.A, endogenous Tiam1 binds to endogenous spinophilin in cells. Immunoprecipitates using control IgG (lane 2) or anti-Tiam1 antibodies (lane 3) were immunoblotted with anti-spinophilin antibodies. Lane 1 contains 5% of total lysate. B, Tiam1 binds to spinophilin through the N-terminal PH/CC/Ex region of the exchange factor. Tiam1 or ΔPCX-Tiam1 was cotransfected into COS-7 cells along with GFP-tagged spinophilin as indicated (+). Cell lysates (lanes 1–3, 7–9) or immunoprecipitates of spinophilin (lanes 4–6) or Tiam1 (lanes 10–12) were immunoblotted with antibodies to Tiam1 (lanes 1–6, upper panel; 7–12, lower panel) or GFP (lanes 1–6, lower panel; 7–12, upper panel). The Tiam1 construct used in these experiments lacked the N-terminal PEST sequences because they make the protein unstable in cells (18Stam J.C. Sander E.E. Michiels F. van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28447-28454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). ΔPCX-Tiam1 encodes a shortened Tiam1, further lacking the PH, CC, and Ex domains. C, spinophilin binds to Tiam1 through C-terminal scaffold sequences. Wild-type and mutant GFP-spinophilin (N543) were transfected along with Tiam1 into COS-7 cells as indicated. Cell lysates (lanes 1–4) or Tiam1 immunoprecipitates (lanes 5–8) were immunoblotted with antibodies to spinophilin (upper panel) or Tiam1 (lower panel). D, interaction with spinophilin leads to Tiam1 membrane translocation. COS7 cells were transfected with GFP, GFP-spinophilin, or GFP-spinophilin-N543 as indicated. The left column panels show the fluorescence of the expressed GFP fusion proteins. Middle column panels show the fluorescence due to endogenous Tiam1. The right column panels show overlay images indicating overlapping fluorescence. Panels in the same row represent images from the same field. E, left panels, both spinophilin and spinophilin-N543 bind to S6K in cells. COS7 cells were transfected with FLAG-S6K1 and spinophilin or spinoN543 as indicated. Cell lysates (lanes 1–4) or FLAG-immunoprecipitates (lanes 5–8) were immunoblotted with antibodies to spinophilin (top panel) or FLAG epitope (bottom panel). Right panels, spinophilin activation of S6K1 correlates with Tiam1 binding. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with S6K1 along with a spinophilin species as indicated. Activation of precipitated S6K was quantitated by PhosphorImager. The results represent at least three experiments done in duplicate and are expressed as fold activation over baseline ± standard deviation. Bottom right panels indicate protein expression in equivalent volumes of cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To map the binding sites between Tiam1 and spinophilin, Tiam1 was transiently transfected along with epitope tagged-spinophilin, and then spinophilin was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. The presence of Tiam1 in the immune complex was detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). Lanes 1–3 in the left panels demonstrate expression of the transfected proteins, while lanes 4–6 reflect immunoblots of precipitated proteins. As expected, Tiam1 was clearly present in a complex with spinophilin at levels greater than those found in control experiments when spinophilin was not co-transfected (compare Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5, top panel). As an additional control experiment, ΔPCX-Tiam1, a mutant lacking the spinophilin binding region, was substituted as the Tiam1 species. This mutant associated with spinophilin (Fig. 2B, lane 6) at levels no greater than the background level observed in lane 4. The background band seen in lanes 4 and 6 represents nonspecific binding to the protein A-Sepharose, as it is also present on complexes produced with control antibody alone (data not shown). These findings were confirmed by performing the converse experiments (see Fig. 2B, right panels), where Tiam1 was immunoprecipitated, and complex formation was assayed by immunoblotting for spinophilin (see Fig. 2B, lanes 7–12). As expected, transfected spinophilin was present in a complex with immunoprecipitated Tiam1 (compare lanes 10 and 11) but not with immunoprecipitated ΔPCX-Tiam1 (lanes 12).Based on the results of the two-hybrid assay, Tiam1 interacts with sequences toward the C terminus of spinophilin. We used a convenient BamHI site to engineer a mutant spinophilin containing only the N-terminal 543 amino acids and lacking the entire coiled-coil domain as well as C-terminal sequences in the PDZ domain (GFP-spino-N543), shown diagrammatically in Fig. 1C. This mutant does not interact with Tiam1 in similar co-transfection experiments (Fig. 2C, compare lane 8 with lane 6). Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4 demonstrate relatively equivalent expressions of both spinophilin species, whereas lanes 6 and 8 show the presence of spinophilin but not spinophilin-N543 in Tiam immunoprecipitates. Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 7 show negligible signals in the absence of expressed Tiam1. When we attempted to localize the binding domain of spinophilin in more detail by testing the C-terminal coiled coil or the PDZ domain individually, no binding activity was observed (data not shown), suggesting that the binding site spans the two domains or that proper folding of the binding domain requires surrounding amino acids.Spinophilin Binding Targets Tiam1 to the Plasma Membrane—We used immunofluorescence to investigate the cellular localization of spinophilin and Tiam1. We compared the cellular distribution of spinophilin expressed as a GFP fusion protein with endogenous Tiam1 in COS7 cells. We found that GFP-spinophilin localized primarily to the plasma membrane, whereas GFP alone was distributed throughout the cell (compare Fig 2D, left column, top two panels). In contrast, Tiam1 exhibited punctate staining throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D, center column, top panel). Interestingly, a fraction of endogenous Tiam became localized at the plasma membrane when spinophilin was transfected into cells (center column, second panel from the top). Overlay images confirmed that Tiam1 and spinophilin co-localized at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D, compare top panel, right column with the second panel from the top, right column). Importantly, while the C-terminally truncated spinophilin GFP-spino-N543, which cannot bind to Tiam, maintained its plasma membrane localization (left column, bottom panel), it failed to re-localize endogenous Tiam1 to the plasma membrane in cells (center column, bottom panel). The inability of GFP-spino-N543 to interact with Tiam1 was confirmed by the lack of co-localizing signals in the overlay image (right column, bottom panel). These findings not only confirm that spinophilin can interact with endogenous Tiam1, they show that spinophilin regulates the distribution of Tiam1 in cells.Tiam Binding Is Associated with the Ability of Spinophilin to Activate S6 Kinase in Cells—To test whether the interaction between spinophilin and endogenous Tiam1 has biologic significance, we investigated p70 S6 kinase activity, because it is known to be stimulated by spinophilin or Rac, the downstream target of Tiam1. First, spinophilin or control vector was transfected into NIH3T3 cells along with FLAG-p70 S6 kinase. Then, p70-S6 kinase was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was assayed in vitro. Consistent with previous reports, we found that transfection of spinophilin activated p70 S6K1 ∼2-fold above background (25Burnett P.E. Blackshaw S. Lai M.M. Qureshi I.A. Burnett A.F. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8351-8356Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (Fig 2E, top right panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). Then we tested spino-N543, the mutant spinophilin that cannot bind to Tiam1 or relocalize it in cells (see Fig 2, C and D) but retains the ability to bind to p70 S6 kinase in cells (Fig 2E, left panels). In contrast to wild-type spinophilin, spino-N543 failed to significantly alter p70 S6 kinase activity"
https://openalex.org/W1966936415,"Objects displaced intermittently across the visual field will nonetheless give an illusion of continuous motion [called apparent motion (AM)] under many common conditions. It is believed that form perception is of minor importance in determining AM, and that AM is mediated by motion-sensitive areas in the “where” pathway of the cortex. However, form and motion typically interact in specific ways when natural objects move through the environment. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical activation to long-range AM, compared to short-range AM and flicker, while we varied stability of structural differences between forms. Long-range AM activated the anterior-temporal lobe in the visual ventral pathway, and the response varied according to the form stability. The results suggest that long-range AM is associated with neural systems for form perception."

It was proposed that the extracellular domain of plexins acts as an inhibitory moiety, preventing receptor activation. Here we show that plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 undergo proteolytic processing in their extracellular portion, thereby converting single-chain precursors into non-disulfide-linked, heterodimeric receptors. We demonstrate that plexin processing is mediated by subtilisin-like proprotein convertases, by inhibition with α1-antitrypsin Portland, and by mutagenesis of the substrate-cleavage sites. We provide evidence indicating that proprotein convertases cleave plexins in a post-Golgi compartment and, likely, at the cell surface. In addition, we find that both cell surface targeting and proteolytic processing of plexin-B1 depend on protein-protein interaction motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. We then show that proteolytic conversion of plexin-B1 into a heterodimeric receptor greatly increases the binding and the functional response to its specific ligand semaphorin 4D/CD100. Thus, we conclude that cleavage by proprotein convertases is a novel regulatory step for semaphorin receptors localized at the cell surface.

The human plexin family contains at least nine members, classified into four distinct subfamilies based on sequence similarity (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In addition, although A-subfamily plexins are predominantly expressed in the developing nervous system, plexin-B1 (the B-subfamily prototype and high-affinity receptor for semaphorin 4D) appears to be more ubiquitously distributed (7Maestrini E. Tamagnone T. Longati P. Cremona O. Gulisano M. Bione S. Tamanini F. Neel B.G. Toniolo D. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of all plexins has features in common with scatter factor receptors (MET gene family) and semaphorins (3Winberg M.L. Noordermeer J.N. Tamagnone L. Comoglio P.M. Spriggs M.K.

In addition to mediating ligand binding, it can associate with neuropilins (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) that deleting part of the extracellular domain of plexins results in a conformational change that activates receptor signaling. This implies that, in the absence of the ligand, the extracellular domain of plexins brings about a steric hindrance that inhibits receptor function. Interestingly, the extracellular domains of plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 contain a putative cleavage site for subtilisin-like proprotein convertases, located in the proximity of the transmembrane domain (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). Moreover, this site is phylogenetically conserved, because it is also found in fly plexin B (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M.

The family of subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (PCs)1 includes furin and many other members (reviewed in Ref. 10Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). They are known to process a variety of transmembrane and secreted proteins, including scatter factor receptors and semaphorins, which are both phylogenetically related to plexins. For class 3 semaphorins, proteolytic cleavage was shown to regulate the axon-repelling activity (11Adams R.H. Lohrum M. Klostermann A. Betz H. Puschel A.W. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6077-6086Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). It has not yet been shown whether plexins B actually undergo proteolytic processing in cells. If this were true, they could either be converted into heterodimeric receptors or their extracellular domain could be released into the extracellular space. The intracellular domain of plexins is extremely well conserved within the family and across evolution and contains stretches that are distantly related to GTPase activating proteins (GAPs, Ref. 12Rhom B.

In this study we have shown that plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 are found in cells and tissues in a heterodimeric form because of proteolytic cleavage by PCs. This event appears to require receptor localization at the cell surface, which in turn is regulated by sequences in the cytoplasmic domain. Finally, we have shown that the proteolytic processing of plexins by PCs significantly increases ligand binding and functional response. Plexin-B1 expression construct (in pcDNA3 vector, Invitrogen) includes an in-frame VSV tag immediately after the signal peptidase site. Plexin-B2 expression construct (in pMT2 expression vector) includes a VSV tag at the COOH terminus of the protein. The secreted form of plexin-B2 (B2-EC) contains the whole extracellular domain of plexin-B2 (amino acids 1–1190) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the COOH terminus by cloning into the expression vector pMT2-GST (a kind gift from D. Shaap). Human PLEXIN-B1 andPLEXIN-B2 cDNAs were mutated in their subtilisin-like substrate-processing sites (R1302RRR → AAAA and R1161QKR → AQKA, respectively) to generate uncleavable forms by virtue of a recombinant PCR-based approach (19Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing.

Cells were lysed on ice in EB buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of a mixture of protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin). Tissue samples were homogenized and lysed in EB buffer. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed according to standard protocols. Final detection was done with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Silver staining of polyacrylamide gels was performed using the silver stain kit (Sigma). Cells were starved for 1 h in serum-free medium (without cysteine and methionine) and pulsed from 20 min to 1 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-mix, Amersham Biosciences), then washed, and chased for different times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed in EB buffer, and proteins were immunoprecipitated as described above and submitted to SDS-PAGE. After fixation, gels were incubated with 1m Na-salicylate for 30 min at room temperature. After gel drying, detection was done by autofluorography or by a PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). Surface proteins were labeled for 30 min at 4 °C using the ECL protein biotinylation module (Amersham Biosciences). After labeling, cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-1% bovine serum albumin to quench unreacted biotin and then lysed in EB buffer. Cell extracts were incubated with the appropriate antibodies or with immobilized streptavidin-agarose (Pierce). Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting; biotinylated proteins were revealed by peroxidase-linked streptavidin (avidin-HRP) and the ECL detection system. NIH-3T3 cells expressing plexin-B1, plexin-B1-uncleav, or vector alone were seeded in 48-well dishes coated with poly(l)-lysine. The next day, cells were incubated with anti-VSV antibody diluted in culture medium for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min, and endogenous phosphatases were inactivated by incubation in a water bath at 65 °C for 15 min. Cell-bound antibodies were then detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Specifically bound alkaline phosphatase activity was eventually revealed by p-nitrophenylphosphate hydrolysis at 37 °C in a reaction buffer containing 1 mTris-HCl, pH 9.5, 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mmMgCl2. Absorbance values were measured at a wavelength of 405 nm and corrected for background absorbance. The Sema4D binding assay using NIH-3T3 cells expressing plexin-B1, B1-uncleav, or vector alone was performed as described (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A.

Previous experiments have shown that plexin-B1 mRNA, unlike that of A subfamily members, is widely distributed in non-neuronal tissues (7Maestrini E. Tamagnone T. Longati P. Cremona O. Gulisano M. Bione S. Tamanini F. Neel B.G. Toniolo D. Comoglio P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To further analyze the expression of plexin-B1 receptor in human cell lines and tissues, we raised specific polyclonal antibodies against its cytoplasmic sequence (IC2, described under “Experimental Procedures”). We first screened a number of cell lines derived from human tumors by Western blotting and detected plexin-B1 expression in GTL-16 (derived from gastric carcinoma), Suit2 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (liver hepatoma), and HT-29 (colon adenocarcinoma) cell lines (Fig. 1 A). In these cells, the IC2 antibody specifically recognized low amounts of a protein with a molecular mass of 300 kDa (most likely corresponding to the full-length receptor) together with a predominant smaller protein of molecular mass of 100 kDa that might correspond to a truncated form of plexin-B1 containing the cytoplasmic domain and a portion of the extracellular moiety. Control experiments with pre-immune serum did not reveal any bands (data not shown). We then analyzed normal human tissue samples (Fig. 1 B) and confirmed that the predominant protein species recognized by the IC2 antibody is a 100-kDa polypeptide, whereas the p300 precursor protein is barely detectable. We ruled out that the 100-kDa fragment was generated because of post-lytic protein degradation, because it was also detected in protein extracts obtained by cell lysis in boiling 2.5% SDS (data not shown). We concluded thatin vivo endogenous plexin-B1 is predominantly expressed as a truncated protein with a molecular mass of 100 kDa. To confirm that the two proteins detected by IC2 were derived from plexin-B1, we analyzed the receptor in transfected cells. When lysates from 293T, MDCK, and NIH-3T3 cells expressing exogenous plexin-B1 were analyzed with IC2, we again detected two protein species (p300 and p100, Fig. 1 C), identical to those found in cells and tissues. Moreover, results obtained with in vitrotranscription/translation experiments from the same cDNA used in transfections ruled out the possibility that downstream ATG codons might be used for alternative translation initiation (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that the truncated fragment of plexin-B1 likely derives from proteolytic processing. We have previously reported (1Tamagnone L. Artigiani S. Chen H. He Z. Ming G.I. Song H. Chedotal A. Winberg M.L. Goodman C.S. Poo M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Comoglio P.M. Cell. 1999; 99: 71-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) that the extracellular domain of plexin-B1 contains a tetrabasic amino acid sequence located in the proximity of the transmembrane domain (i.e. R1302RRR), which fits well with the consensus for cleavage by subtilisin-like PCs. Proteolytic processing in this site could therefore explain the consistent finding of cleaved plexin-B1 in cells and tissues. By analogy with scatter factor receptors, the proteolytic processing of plexin-B1 by PCs might lead to the conversion of a single-chain precursor into a heterodimeric receptor. This would result in an extracellular moiety (with a molecular mass of ∼200 kDa, subunit α) and a transmembrane moiety (with a molecular mass of ∼100 kDa, subunit β) that contains a small extracellular region and the plexin cytoplasmic domain (Fig.2 A). In fact, we found that cells transfected with plexin-B1 express both the full-length receptor (p300) and two cleaved subunits (p200 and p100) at the cell surface (Fig. 2 B). The identity of p100 as β subunit was confirmed by detection with IC2 antibodies, whereas p200 α subunit was identified by anti-VSV immunoblotting. In addition, we demonstrated the presence of plexin-B1 heterodimers on the surface of cells expressing endogenous receptors (Fig. 2 C), using a monoclonal antibody directed against its extracellular domain (EC6.9). To confirm that the two subunits of plexin-B1 are associated in a complex, we show that the extracellular subunit is efficiently purified with an antibody (IC2) directed against the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (Fig.2 D). In contrast to the plexin-B1 p300 precursor, the cleaved subunits were easily detectable at the cell surface (as demonstrated by surface biotinylation). Plexin-B2, another member of the B subfamily of plexin receptors, also contains a polybasic sequence (R1161QKR) fitting with the consensus for PC-specific cleavage. Because an antibody directed against plexin-B2 was not available, we immunopurified an epitope-tagged form of plexin-B2 expressed in 293T cells. By Western blotting experiments using anti-VSV antibody (recognizing the COOH terminus of plexin-B2), we could detect two proteins with molecular mass of 240 and 80 kDa (Fig.3 A). Reminiscent of plexin-B1 precursor and β subunit, p240 has the predicted size of a single-chain plexin-B2 precursor, and p80 may represent the plexin-B2 β subunit. This would also imply the existence of an α subunit of plexin-B2 at the cell surface. Indeed, by cell surface biotinylation, we could easily detect a protein with a molecular mass of ∼170 kDa, likely corresponding to the cleaved α subunit of plexin-B2, containing almost the entire extracellular domain (Fig.3 A). A large amount of p80 β subunit is detected with anti-VSV antibodies among biotinylated cell membrane proteins, whereas only a minor fraction of uncleaved plexin-B2 is exposed at the cell surface (Fig. 3 A, right panel). Similar to plexin-B1, we conclude that plexin-B2 is predominantly expressed at the cell surface as a heterodimer, whereas p240 probably represents the full-length precursor. Furthermore, to confirm that both p170 and p80 are derived from the proteolytic cleavage of p240 precursor, we carried out pulse-chase experiments. Fig. 3 B shows that the plexin-B2 p240 precursor decreased during the chase, whereas p80 and p170 subunits accumulated with the same kinetics and could be co-purified. We concluded that p170 represents the α subunit of plexin-B2, released by cleavage and yet associated with p80 β subunit. In addition, we found that the receptor subunits are not covalently linked by disulfide bonds, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions of immunopurified plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 (Fig.3 C). The disulfide-linked heterodimeric receptor Met was included as a control (24Giordano S. Di Renzo M.F. Narsimhan R.P. Cooper C.S. Rosa C. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 1383-1388PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the presence of a specific consensus substrate-cleavage site for PCs in the extracellular domain of plexins B, we verified whether receptor processing could be inhibited by treating cells with convertase inhibitors. We first tested the PC-specific inhibitor decanoyl-RVKR-chloromethylketone (25Garten W. Hallenberger S. Ortmann D. Schäfer W. Vey M.H. Angliker H. Shaw E. Klenk H.D. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, this inhibitor completely blocked the processing of both plexin-B1 and plexin-B2. Furthermore, we treated plexin-expressing cells with the PC-inhibitor α1-antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX, Refs. 26Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 27Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 B, we observed a dramatic impairment of the proteolytic processing of both plexins upon co-expression with α1-PDX. We also observed increased amounts of the uncleaved precursors on the cell surface (data not shown). Analogously, α1-antitrypsin Portland inhibited receptor processing and formation of p100 in cells expressing endogenous plexin-B1 (Fig. 4 C). It is known that PCs require two basic charged residues in positions −1 and −4 with respect to the actual substrate-cleavage site, leading to the identification of the minimal consensus sequence RXXR (reviewed in Ref. 10Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). We have identified sequences in the extracellular domain of human plexin-B1 and plexin-B2 that fit this consensus and described a proteolytic processing consistent with the use of these sites. To confirm that plexin processing is caused by cleavage by PCs in the indicated positions, we mutated the specific consensus sequences in the extracellular domain of plexin-B1 and plexin-B2. As shown in Fig. 5, these mutated receptors, although normally targeted to the cell surface, cannot be proteolytically cleaved, indicating that PC-specific cleavage sites at the identified positions are absolutely required for processing. PC-dependent processing generally takes place during transit through the Golgi complex or within secretory vesicles en route to the cell membrane. However, proprotein convertases are also exposed on the plasma membrane and can be shed in the extracellular space or recycled into the cell (reviewed in Ref. 28Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 28-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). To determine whether the proteolytic cleavage of plexins-B takes place before or after transit through the Golgi apparatus, we treated plexin-B2-expressing cells with protein sorting inhibitors. Monensin A, which inhibits vesicular trafficking between Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane, efficiently blocked the proteolytic processing of the receptor (Fig. 6 A). Brefeldin A, which inhibits the trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, was also effective. As a complementary approach, we expressed a secretable form of plexin-B2 extracellular domain, including its substrate-cleavage site, fused to glutathione S-transferase at the COOH terminus (B2-EC) (Fig. 6 B). The molecule was efficiently processed and secreted, and two associated subunits accumulated in the conditioned medium, as demonstrated by silver staining and anti-GST Western blotting (Fig. 6 B, left panels). Protein p170 (indicated by b) corresponds to the plexin-B2 α subunit, and protein p30 (c) to the short extracellular sequence of the β subunit fused to GST. The cleavage efficiency of B2-EC was comparable with that of the full-length plexin, inasmuch as some of it was found in the cell lysate as precursor (Fig. 6 B,right panels, a), probably because of protein overexpression. In contrast, we could not find any processed B2-EC protein intracellularly or associated with the cell surface, suggesting that the cleavage occurs after plexin delivery at the plasma membrane or immediately preceding secretion. Intriguingly, the presence of some uncleaved precursor bound to cell surface proteins suggests that proteolytic cleavage might induce a conformational change, leading to the secretion of the associated subunits into the medium. To demonstrate this assumption, we produced an uncleavable form of B2-EC by mutating the conserved substrate-cleavage site, analogously to what is shown in Fig. 5 for the full-size receptor. This uncleavable mutant remained attached to the cell surface and was absent from the medium (Fig. 6 B, far right lanes). It was reported recently that the COOH-terminal sequence of plexin-B1 associates with a PDZ-Rho-GEF (16Swiercz J.M. Kuner R. Behrens J. Offermanns S.

Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a MiRP ॆ-subunit, MPS-1, and of a voltage-gated pore-forming potassium subunit, KVS-1, from the nematode<i>Caenorhabditis elegans. mps-1</i> is expressed in chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons and co-localizes with<i>kvs-1</i> in a subset of these. Inactivation of either<i>mps-1</i> or <i>kvs-1</i> by RNA interference (RNAi) causes partially overlapping neuronal defects and results in broad-spectrum neuronal dysfunction, including defective chemotaxis, disrupted mechanotransduction, and impaired locomotion. Inactivation of one subunit by RNAi dramatically suppresses the expression of the partner subunit only in cells where the two proteins co-localize. Co-expression of MPS-1 and KVS-1 in mammalian cells gives rise to a potassium current distinct from the KVS-1 current. Taken together these data indicate that potassium currents constitute a basic determinant for <i>C. elegans</i> neuronal function and unravel a unifying principle of evolutionary significance: that potassium channels in various organisms use MiRPs to generate uniqueness of function with rich variation in the details.AF541979AF541978"
https://openalex.org/W2125411529,"We compared the abilities of cholesterolversus various oxysterols as substrate and/or as activator for the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), by monitoring the activity of purified human ACAT1 in response to sterols solubilized in mixed micelles or in reconstituted vesicles. The results showed that 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol and 7α-hydroxycholesterol are comparable with cholesterol as the favored substrates, whereas 7-ketocholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol are very poor substrates for the enzyme. We then tested the ability of 7-ketocholesterol as an activator when cholesterol was measured as the substrate, andvice versa. When cholesterol was measured as the substrate, the addition of 7-ketocholesterol could not activate the enzyme. In contrast, when 7-ketocholesterol was measured as the substrate, the addition of cholesterol significantly activated the enzyme and changed the shape of the substrate saturation curve from sigmoidal to essentially hyperbolic. Additional results show that, as an activator, cholesterol is much better than all the oxysterols tested. These results suggest that ACAT1 contains two types of sterol binding sites; the structural requirement for the ACAT activator site is more stringent than it is for the ACAT substrate site.

Upon activation by cholesterol, ACAT1 becomes promiscuous toward various sterols as its substrate. acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidylcholine Acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT)1 is a membrane-bound enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). It is present in a variety of cell types and tissues and utilizes two lipophilic substrates, cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A, to catalyze the formation of neutral lipid cholesteryl esters. In mammals, two ACAT isoforms exist (ACAT1 and ACAT2) (reviewed in Ref. 1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Lin S. Yu C. Li B.L. Miyazaki A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 289-296Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of ACAT1 is essentially ubiquitous, whereas that of ACAT2 is more restricted. The physiological roles of these isoforms in various tissues are under active investigation. At the single cell level, ACAT participates in controlling the cellular membrane cholesterol level. Unlike many other enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism, regulation of ACAT by sterol occurs at the post-translational level. In mixed micelles or in reconstituted vesicles, both ACAT1 and ACAT2 display a sigmoidal response to cholesterol as their substrates (2Chang C.C.Y. Sakashita N. Ornvold K. Lee O. Chang E. Dong R. Lin S. Lee C.Y.G. Strom S. Kashyap R. Fung J. Farese Jr., R. Patoiseau J.F. Delhon A. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28083-28092Google Scholar). These results are consistent with the concept that the ACAT activity is allosterically regulated by membrane cholesterol content in the ER (reviewed in Ref. 3Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Google Scholar). Oxysterols are sterols containing a second oxygen atom, present as a carbonyl, hydroxyl, or epoxide group in rings A or B or in the side chain, in addition to the C3 hydroxyl group. A large number of oxysterols are found in various locations, including food products, plasma, or inside the cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Google Scholar and 5Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Google Scholar). They are produced by various enzymes in vivo, and/or by chemical oxidation in vitro. 24-Hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, 27-hydroxycholesterol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol are the four main oxysterols enzymatically derived (5Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Google Scholar, 6Russell D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 126-135Google Scholar) and can be found in the plasma and inside certain cell types. 7-Ketocholesterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol are the four major oxysterols found in human atherosclerotic lesions (5Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Google Scholar, 7Brown A.J. Mander E.L. Gelissen I.C. Kritharides L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 226-236Google Scholar). In addition, 7-ketocholesterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol are the major oxysterols present in oxidized low density lipoprotein preparations in vitro (8Dzeletovic S. Babiker A. Lund E. Diczfalusy U. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1995; 78: 119-128Google Scholar, 9Patel R.P. Diczfalusy U. Dzeletovic S. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 2361-2371Google Scholar). Oxysterols possess a wide range of biological properties and may play regulatory roles in cholesterol metabolism. For example, when added to the culture medium of intact cells, most oxysterols, including 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol, greatly suppressed the cholesterol biosynthesis rate (10Kandutsch A.A. Chen H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 8408-8417Google Scholar, 11Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Google Scholar). Several oxysterols are high affinity ligands for the nuclear receptor LXRα1 (13Janowski B.A. Willy P.J. Devi T.R. Falck J.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Google Scholar, 14Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.-L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Google Scholar), and one of them, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, has been proposed as a participant in cholesterol regulation in the liver (12Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Collins J.L. Bledsoe R.K. Consler T.G. Moore L.B. Galardi C.M. McKee D.D. Moore J.T. Watson M.A. Parks D.J. Lambert M.H. Willson T.M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 886-897Google Scholar). On the other hand, the roles of oxysterols in controlling cholesterol homeostasis in vivo are still under debate, partly because in various mammalian systems examined, various oxysterols are present in very low concentrations, with much shorter half-lives relative to cholesterol (15Bjorkhem I. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 725-730Google Scholar). Oxysterols have also been shown to have effects on ACAT activity. For example, when added to medium of tissue culture cells, oxysterols such as 7-ketocholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol, in addition to their suppressive effect on cholesterol biosynthesis rate, stimulated cholesterol esterification rate and increased ACAT activity (16Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4925-4927Google Scholar). When cholesterol was added in the same manner, it failed to provide the same response. Despite numerous studies, the mechanism of oxysterol-mediated activation of cholesteryl ester biosynthesis had not been clarified. It could be due to the presence of a putative oxysterol binding site present in ACAT1 or could be due to the ability of oxysterol to mobilize cellular cholesterol to the ER; other mechanism(s) could not be ruled out. We and other investigators used various crude cell extract systems and had demonstrated the apparent activation of ACAT by 25-hydroxycholesterol in vitro (17Erickson S.K. Shrewsbury M.A. Brooks C. Myer D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 930-941Google Scholar, 18Lichtenstein A.H. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9098-9104Google Scholar, 19Cheng D. Chang C.C. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Google Scholar). However, in these studies, the enzyme ACAT and the sterols (cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol) serving as substrate and/or activator were present in different membranes. Thus, one could not rule out the possibility that the apparent activation by 25-hydroxycholesterol was due to its ability to translocate cholesterol from a cholesterol-rich membrane to a cholesterol-poor membrane where ACAT is located (discussed in Ref. 19Cheng D. Chang C.C. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Google Scholar). Studies were also performed attempting to determine the sterol substrate specificity of ACAT. When individual sterols were delivered in vesicle form to the enzyme, Cases et al. (20Cases S. Novak S. Zheng Y.W. Myers H. Lear S.R. Sande E. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Spencer T.A. Krause B.R. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26755-26764Google Scholar) have shown that ACAT seemed to utilize various oxysterols much more efficiently than cholesterol. Again, these studies involved the use of crude enzyme extracts, with ACAT and sterols present in different membranes. Among various sterols, the ability to move from the donor membrane to the ACAT-containing membrane differs greatly (21Theunissen J.J.H. Jackson R.L. Kempen H.J.M. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 66-74Google Scholar). The transfer rates for oxysterols were much faster (more than 10 times) than those for cholesterol; these differences could greatly mask the true sterol specificity for the enzyme. Thus, the intrinsic substrate specificity of ACAT could not be determined from these studies. In oxidized low density lipoprotein-loaded macrophages, large amounts of esterified oxysterols and esterified cholesterol are present in the cytosolic fraction of the cells; these cytosolic steryl esters are the products of ACAT reaction (7Brown A.J. Mander E.L. Gelissen I.C. Kritharides L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 226-236Google Scholar). How ACAT can utilize oxysterols in the presence of large amounts of cellular cholesterol is not clear, partly because the relative specificity of ACAT toward oxysterols and cholesterol as substrate or as activator has not been clarified. In the current work, we compared the abilities of several selected oxysterols versus cholesterol as ACAT substrates or as ACAT activators. The oxysterols evaluated included, as representatives of ring A or B oxysterols, 7α-, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, and 5α,6α- and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol and, as a representative of side-chain oxysterols, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. We first placed sterols and the enzyme in mixed micelles (22Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Google Scholar), using human ACAT1 purified to homogeneity as the enzyme source and analyzed the enzyme activity in response to varying sterol concentrations. In mixed micelles, the sterol is in direct contact with the enzyme in solution form (23Carman G.M. Deems R.A. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18711-18714Google Scholar). This assay system also avoids the formation of sterol microdomain(s). On the other hand, the environment provided by the mixed micelles is not close to that of ACAT1 under physiological conditions, because ACAT1 is an integral membrane protein residing in the ER. We therefore tested the validity of information learned from using the mixed micelles system by using the reconstituted vesicle system (24Doolittle G.M. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 529-537Google Scholar, 25Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1683-1692Google Scholar). The latter system provides an environment close to that of ACAT1 under physiological conditions. In addition, the sterol and the enzyme ACAT1 reside in the same vesicles, thus eliminating the sterol transfer step between two different vesicles prior to enzyme catalysis. Our results show that ACAT1 can accommodate cholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol as its three preferred substrates. In contrast, for activation of ACAT1, cholesterol is superior to all of the oxysterols tested, including 7-ketocholesterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, or 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, the structural requirement for sterol as an ACAT activator is more stringent than it is for sterol as an ACAT substrate. Cholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, β-sitosterol, CHAPS, taurocholate, oleoyl-coenzyme A, egg phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesteryl oleate, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, imidazole, oleic anhydride, triethylamine, and primulin dye were all from Sigma. 7α-Hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol were from Steraloids. 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol was synthesized as previously described (26Tomkinson N.C.O. Willson T.M. Russel J.S. Spencer T.A. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 9919-9923Google Scholar, 27Spencer T.A. Li D. Russel J.S. Tomkinson N.C. Willson T.M. J. Org. Chem. 2000; 65: 1919-1923Google Scholar). All of the sterols showed single spots in TLC analysis and were used without further purification. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-p-cresol was from Eastman Kodak Co. The Centrisart ultrafiltration device (cut-off molecular mass, 300 kDa) was from Sartorius. Organic solvents used were reagent grade and were from Fisher. Grace's insect cell medium was from Invitrogen. The software program Prism (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was from Sigma. The source of enzyme was recombinant human ACAT1 expressed in insect Hi5 cells and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. The purification procedure was as described previously (22Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Google Scholar, 28Lu X. Lin S. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 276: 711-718Google Scholar), using nickel column chromatography and ACAT1 monoclonal column chromatography. For some of the experiments reported in this work (see Fig. 4), the enzyme source used was HisACAT1Δ1–65 (29Yu C. Zhang Y. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3762-3769Google Scholar). The ACAT1 monoclonal antibody only recognizes the N terminus of the enzyme. The HisACAT1Δ1–65 enzyme lacked the N-terminal and thus could only be partially purified, using nickel column chromatography (29Yu C. Zhang Y. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3762-3769Google Scholar). The enzyme was assayed in sterol/PC/taurocholate mixed micelles or in reconstituted vesicles conducted as described previously (22Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Google Scholar), using the radioactive substrate [3H]oleoyl coenzyme A at 4 × 104dpm/nmol. The mixed micelles were prepared as described previously (22Chang C.C.Y. Lee C.Y.G. Chang E.T. Cruz J.C. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Google Scholar), containing varying sterol concentrations, reported as mol % sterol/sterol + PC as indicated in various figures, in 11.2 mm PC and 18.6 mm taurocholate. For assays that contained two different sterols, each sterol/PC/taurocholate mixed micelles sample was made separately and then mixed together and used within 6 h. The reconstituted vesicles were prepared essentially as described previously (30Ventimiglia J.B. Levesque M.C. Chang T.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 323-330Google Scholar, 31Shi S.P. Chang C.C.Y. Gould G.W. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 982: 187-195Google Scholar). In the current work, we used taurocholate instead of cholate as the detergent to prepare the bile salt/PC/sterol micelles, with taurocholate at 18.6 mm and the PC at 11.2 mm. We then used cholestyramine to remove bile salt from mixed micelles, which rapidly led to vesicle formation. Control experiments using radioactive taurocholate showed that after two treatments of cholestyramine, more than 99% of the taurocholate was removed from the resultant vesicles. The sterol solubility in micellar solutions was monitored by subjecting the solutions to ultracentrifugation (at 50,0000 × g for 40 min) followed by ultrafiltration through a Sartorius Centrisart ultrafiltration device that contains a membrane with a molecular mass cut-off of 300 kDa as described (32Moschetta A. Eckhardt E.R.M. De Smet M.B.M. Renooij W. Van Berge-Henegouwen G.P. Van Erpecum K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 15-27Google Scholar). After the ultracentrifugation and the ultrafiltration steps, the sterols were quantitated according to the method described previously (33White T. Bursten S. Federighi D. Lewis R.A. Nudelman E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 109-117Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipids present in the untreated samples or in the supernatants after treatment were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1), spotted onto the TLC plate, and separated using the solvent system hexane/acetone/acetic acid = 80:20:1 (v/v/v). The plate was sprayed with a 0.05% solution of primulin dye and then scanned by using the STORM 860 imaging system to detect the laser-excited fluorescent signals. Spots of a given sterol were quantitated by integration of variable pixel intensities using the ImageQuant software. Standard curves were produced by quantitating increasing amounts (10–200 μg) of a given sterol sample spotted in parallel lanes. Various nonradioactive sterol oleate esters were used as internal markers and visualized by iodine staining after TLC analysis. Other than cholesteryl oleate and 25-hydroxycholesterol (from Steraloids), the sterol esters described in the current work were not commercially available. They were chemically synthesized based on the general instruction provided by Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Typically, 5 μmol of a given sterol was weighed in an amber vial, and 0.166 ml of methylene chloride was added and swirled briefly. 0.075 ml of triethylamine, 3 mg of oleic anhydride, and 0.042 mg of 4-dimethylaminopyridine as catalyst and 2 μl of 0.1% 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol in methylene chloride as antioxidant were then added. The vial was sealed under nitrogen and stirred with a magnetic stir bar overnight in the dark. 12 h later, the same amounts of oleic anhydride, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol described before were added, and the reaction was continued for an additional 10 h. The sterol oleates synthesized were used as the internal markers for TLC without purification. When TLC plates were run in a petroleum ether/ether/acetic acid (90:10:1) solvent system, theR f values for oleates of the following sterols were as follows: cholesterol, 0.87; 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, 0.51; 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, 0.58; 7-ketocholesterol, 0.36; 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 0.21; 7β-hydroxycholesterol, 0.28; β-sitosterol, 0.89; 25-hydroxycholesterol, 0.30; 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, 0.46. In order to quantitatively compare the abilities of various sterols that serve as ACAT substrate and/or activator, a single phase system composed of the enzyme, phospholipid, and sterol is needed. We had previously developed a mixed micelles system for measuring ACAT activity. This system consisted of mixing egg PC, taurocholate, and cholesterol at appropriate ratios, followed by bath-sonication at cold temperature until optical clearance. The enzyme ACAT solubilized in low concentration of the detergent CHAPS was then added to the mixed micelles before the reaction began. It is possible that the micelles prepared by sonication may still contain a minor portion of sterol in the form of supersaturated microcrystals and/or multilamellar or unilamellar vesicles. To remove microcrystals and/or vesicles from the micelles, Moschetta et al. (32Moschetta A. Eckhardt E.R.M. De Smet M.B.M. Renooij W. Van Berge-Henegouwen G.P. Van Erpecum K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 15-27Google Scholar) developed a simple and effective procedure that involved ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration. We used this procedure to monitor the quality of the mixed micelles that contained either cholesterol, or 7-ketocholesterol, or 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol. The results showed that essentially 100% of these three sterols existed in the micellar phase at concentrations from 0.25 to 2 mm (which is equivalent to 0.022–0.15 mol % sterol/sterol + PC) (data not shown). Other sterols, including 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol, β-sitosterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, and 7β-hydroxycholesterol, behaved in the same manner (results not shown). In contrast, oxysterols that contain the hydroxy groups at the side chain, including 24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 27-hydroxycholesterol, could only produce clear micellar solutions at no more than 0.5 mm (0.043 mol % sterol/sterol + PC). Therefore, in our current study, we have focused our effort on comparing various sterols that readily form mixed micelles. We compared the ability of seven sterols to serve as substrates of ACAT by varying their concentrations from 0.047 to 2.0 mm, which amount to 0.004–0.15 mol % sterol/sterol + PC. In some experiments, the highest concentrations were extended to 2.3 mm (0.17 mol % sterol/sterol + PC). The solubility of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol was higher than that of oxysterols with hydroxy groups at the side chain; this property allowed us to study 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol at concentrations between 0.0047 and 0.1 mol % sterol/sterol + PC. The results (Fig.1) show that 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol, cholesterol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol are the three best substrates. All three sterols exhibit sigmoidal substrate saturation curves; theK 0.5 values (the concentration at which half-maximal velocity is achieved) for these three sterols were similar, varying between 0.7 and 0.9 mol % sterol/sterol + PC. At sterol concentrations above K 0.5, 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol is a slightly better substrate than cholesterol, whereas 7α-hydroxycholesterol is ∼70% as efficient as cholesterol as the substrate (results of three independent experiments). The other three sterols tested, 7-ketocholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and β-sitosterol (a major plant sterol) were all vastly inferior to cholesterol as the substrate. In addition, 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol tested at concentrations up to 0.1 mol % sterol/sterol + PC is also a poor substrate. Theinset showed the same data using a smaller scale to report the ACAT activity. It demonstrates that ACAT1 can definitely use any of the latter four sterols as substrates although in a far less efficient manner. We next tested the effect of cholesterol when 7-ketocholesterol serves as the substrate, and vice versa. The results (Fig.2 A) show that cholesterol added at low concentrations (from 0.01 to 0.1 mol % sterol/sterol + PC) significantly activated the enzyme when 7-ketocholesterol was measured as the substrate. It also changed the substrate saturation curve from being sigmoidal to essentially hyperbolic. Calculations (using the software program Prism) showed that the Hill coefficient decreased from 3.0 without cholesterol to 1.1 with cholesterol added at 0.1 mol % sterol/sterol + PC. The K 0.5 value decreased from 0.13 mol % sterol/sterol + PC without cholesterol to 0.04 mol % sterol/sterol + PC with cholesterol. TheV max value increased from 150 nmol/min without cholesterol to 200 nmol/min with cholesterol. The activation effect by cholesterol shown in Fig. 2 A could not be explained, because cholesterol is a better substrate and binds to the catalytic site more efficiently. If this were the case, cholesterol should have caused severe inhibition when 7-ketocholesterol was measured as the substrate. When cholesterol was measured as the substrate, 7-ketocholesterol added at low concentrations (from 0.005 to 0.025 mol % sterol/sterol + PC) caused slight inhibition of the enzyme (Fig. 2 B). The inhibition was more prominent at higher cholesterol concentrations. Thus, the inhibitory effect of 7-ketocholesterol is presumably through substrate competition. 7-Ketocholesterol did not alter the sigmoidicity of the cholesterol substrate saturation curve. Calculations showed that the K 0.5 value for cholesterol stayed at 0.07 mol % sterol/sterol + PC, and the Hill coefficient stayed around 2.2, with or without 7-ketocholesterol added.Figure 2Sterol substrate saturation curves of HisACAT1 with both cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol present in mixed micelles. The final concentrations of cholesterol or 7-ketocholesterol were as indicated. A, 7-ketocholesterol substrate saturation curve in the presence of the indicated concentrations of cholesterol.

Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36139-36145Google Scholar). We had previously shown that by deleting the first 65 amino acid residues from the N-terminal, the enzyme could be converted to a dimeric form. This form was designated as hACAT1Δ1–65. The dimeric enzyme is 5–10 times more active than the native ACAT1 in terms of catalytic efficiency (29Yu C. Zhang Y. Lu X. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3762-3769Google Scholar). We compared the effect of cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol using hACAT1Δ1–65 as the enzyme source. The results show (Fig.3 A) that cholesterol significantly activated the enzyme activity when 7-ketocholesterol was measured as the substrate, whereas 7-ketocholesterol added had minimal effect on the enzyme activity when cholesterol was measured as the substrate (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the ability of cholesterol to activate the enzyme does not require the enzyme to exist at the tetrameric form. We next tested the effect of cholesterol when 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol was measured as the substrate, andvice versa. The results showed that cholesterol added at low concentrations significantly activated the enzyme when 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol was used as the substrate, whereas 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol added inhibited the enzyme when cholesterol was measured as the substrate (data not shown). This result suggested that cholesterol may be a better activator than 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, although the latter sterol is a slightly better substrate than cholesterol (Fig. 1). To test this interpretation, we next used 7-ketocholesterol as the substrate at two different concentrations (at 0.08 or 0.12 mol % sterol/sterol + PC) and compared cholesterol versus various other sterols as indicated, including 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, for their abilities to activate the enzyme. The results (Fig. 4) showed that among all the sterols tested, cholesterol is the only sterol that caused significant activation of the enzyme. In intact cells, ACAT resides mainly in the ER and uses sterol present in the ER as the enzymatic substrate (3Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Google Scholar). To measure ACAT activity in a system that is similar to the ER, we next tested the effects of various sterols present in vesicle form. To avoid the step of sterol transfer between donor vesicles to the vesicles where ACAT resides, we had previously developed a reconstituted vesicle system by diluting the ACAT solubilized in detergent into a large excess of preformed vesicles with defined sterol and PC composition (24Doolittle G.M. Chang T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 529-537Google Scholar). We now used the reconstituted vesicle system to compare the abilities of cholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol to serve as ACAT substrates. The results show (Fig. 5) that 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol and cholesterol are much better substrates than 7-ketocholesterol. For each of the sterols tested, the enzyme responded to the sterol content present in the vesicles in a sigmoidal-like manner. We next tested the effect of cholesterol on ACAT activity when 7-ketocholesterol was measured as the substrate, andvice versa. The results show that cholesterol added at low concentrations significantly activated the enzyme when 7-ketocholesterol (Fig. 6 A) was measured as the substrate, whereas 7-ketocholesterol (Fig.6 B) added inhibited the enzyme, presumably through substrate competition, when cholesterol was measured as the substrate. In data not shown, we also tested the effect of cholesterol on ACAT activity when 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol was measured as the substrate, andvice versa, and have obtained essentially the same results as described in Fig. 6, A and B. To further test this finding using the reconstituted vesicle system, we used 7-ketocholesterol as the variable substrate and compared cholesterol and 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol, added at 0.4 mol % sterol/sterol + PC, for their ability to activate the enzyme. The results (Fig.7) show that cholesterol is superior to 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol as the activator. Thus, the results using the reconstituted vesicles system fully corroborated the results using the mixed micelles system.Figure 6Sterol substrate saturation curves of HisACAT1 with both cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol present in reconstituted vesicles. The cholesterol/PC/taurocholate and 7-ketocholesterol/PC/taurocholate mixed micelles were made separately and then mixed and treated with cholestyramine to produce the reconstituted vesicles.

The final concentration of cholesterol or 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol added was at 0.04 mol %. The assays were done in duplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the current work, we employed the mixed micelles assay system to compare the abilities of various sterols to serve as a substrate for ACAT1. The results show that cholesterol and 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol are the two best substrates tested. 7α-Hydroxycholesterol is the third best substrate, being 70% as efficient, whereas other sterols such as 7-ketocholesterol were 10% or less as efficient. Modification of cholesterol by including the 7α-hydroxy moiety in steroid ring B is moderately tolerated as the enzymatic substrate. We then developed a method to compare the abilities of various sterols serving as ACAT activators. The results show that cholesterol is far superior as an activator to all other sterols tested, including 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol or 7α-hydroxycholesterol. Thus, the structural specificity of the activator site is much more stringent than its sterol substrate site. The results obtained by using the mixed micelles have essentially been confirmed by using the reconstituted vesicles system. In bile salt-based mixed micelles, a sterol-specific microdomain(s) has not been reported. In PC-based vesicles, the physical properties of cholesterol, 5α,6α-epoxycholestanol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, 7β-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol have previously been shown to be similar to those of cholesterol (19Cheng D. Chang C.C. Qu X. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 685-695Google Scholar, 35Li Q.-T. Das N.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 473-478Google Scholar, 36Verhagen J.C.D. ter Braake P. Teunissen J. van Ginkel G. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1488-1502Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that the sterol specificity demonstrated in our current work is mainly due to the intrinsic specificity of the enzyme, not due to subtle difference in biophysical properties of sterols in micelles or in vesicles. We also show that the ability of cholesterol to serve as an activator is preserved when the oligomeric structure of ACAT changes from the tetrameric form to a dimeric form. To explain these results, we propose the following model: ACAT1 contains a sterol substrate site and an allosteric sterol activator site. The activator site is restricted to cholesterol only, whereas the substrate site is more promiscuous. When 7-ketocholesterol is the substrate, activation by cholesterol at low concentration decreases theK 0.5 value as well as increasing theV max value toward 7-ketocholesterol. When 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol is the substrate, activation by cholesterol at low concentration decreases the K 0.5 value without affecting the V max value of the enzyme toward 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol. In the future, using various biochemical approaches that include photoaffinity labeling and site-specific mutagenesis, studies can test the validity of this model. In oxidized low density lipoprotein-loaded macrophages, a large amount of esterified oxysterols including 7-ketocholesterol are found; those present in the cytosol were derived from ACAT reaction (7Brown A.J. Mander E.L. Gelissen I.C. Kritharides L. Dean R.T. Jessup W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 226-236Google Scholar). These observations could be explained based on our model; ACAT1 present in macrophages is activated by cholesterol in the cholesterol-rich environment and becomes more efficient in using 7-ketocholesterol as an alternative substrate, thus causing an ample amount of 7-ketocholesterol to be esterified. In addition, as shown in our current work, β-sitosterol (a major plant sterol) is a poor ACAT1 substrate and a poor activator. Our model predicts that β-sitosterol may become a much better substrate of ACAT1 when the enzyme is under high cholesterol conditions. In the future, this prediction could be tested under various physiological conditions. Related to our current work, Brown et al. (37Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Google Scholar) have recently shown that when added as cyclodextrin complex, cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, 7α-hydroxycholesterol, or other structurally related sterols added to the ER membranes in vitro causes conformational change of the sterol-sensing protein SCAP. Oxysterols with hydroxy groups at the side chain, such as 25-hydroxycholesterol or 27-hydroxycholesterol, fail to initiate this change. SCAP is a key factor involved in sterol-specific transcriptional regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. The sterol specificity demonstrated in their system strongly suggests that it is cholesterol itself that acts on the sterol regulatory machinery. The authors did not test the abilities of the sterols to cause conformational change of SCAP in a dose-dependent manner. Our results reported here show that cholesterol is superior to either 7-ketocholesterol or 7α-cholesterol as an ACAT activator in vitro. Both ACAT1 and SCAP are integral membrane proteins that mainly reside in the ER. Our results thus reinforce the results of Brown et al. (37Brown A.J. Sun L. Feramisco J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 237-245Google Scholar), supporting the concept that the content of cholesterol rather than the content of an oxysterol such as 7-ketocholesterol or 7α-hydroxycholesterol located in the ER plays a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular cholesterol metabolism. The fact that 7-ketocholesterol added in intact cells caused significant stimulation in esterification of cholesterol (16Brown M.S. Dana S.E. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4925-4927Google Scholar) could be explained by its ability to cause translocation of cholesterol from the plasma membrane to the ER, where ACAT resides (3Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Google Scholar, 38Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13103-13108Google Scholar). Due to their limited solubility in mixed micelles, we could not perform extensive testing on various oxysterols with hydroxymoiety at the side chain. We did, however, find that 25-hydroxycholesterol at concentrations up to 0.05 mol % was also a poor substrate for ACAT1. When cholesterol was measured as a substrate, 25-hydroxycholesterol added at low concentration failed to increase ACAT activity, whereas cholesterol added at low concentration greatly increased the ACAT activity in utilizing 25-hydroxycholesterol as the substrate (results not shown). In lipid membranes, the oxysterols with hydroxy groups at the side chain are very different from cholesterol in terms of their biophysical properties (21Theunissen J.J.H. Jackson R.L. Kempen H.J.M. Demel R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 860: 66-74Google Scholar, 35Li Q.-T. Das N.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 315: 473-478Google Scholar, 36Verhagen J.C.D. ter Braake P. Teunissen J. van Ginkel G. Sevanian A. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1488-1502Google Scholar). Kauffman et al. (39Kauffman J. Westerman P.W. Carey M.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 991-1003Google Scholar) proposed that 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol might prefer to interact with PC in “reverse orientation” (i.e. with its hydrophilic side chain lining up with the polar moiety of the PC molecules in membranes). Based on earlier studies and the current results, if oxysterols serve as important regulators for ACAT activity in intact cells, they may act through certain novel mechanism(s) rather than by incorporating into the ER membranes and being recognized by ACAT as a preferred activating molecule.

Transfection caused expression of CYP27A1, formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol, and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Transfection enhanced cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I or human plasma by 2–3-fold but did not affect the efflux in the absence of acceptor. The analysis of released sterols revealed that 27-hydroxycholesterol represented only a small proportion of sterols, most of which was non-oxidized cholesterol. Time course and dose dependence studies showed that expression of CYP27A1 in CHOP cells mostly affected the efflux of the “fast” cholesterol pool, and relatively more cholesterol was released with low concentrations of an acceptor. Preincubation of non-transfected cells with exogenous 27-hydroxycholesterol (10−9 and 10−7m) led to the stimulation of cholesterol efflux by 24–60%. Expression of CYP27A1 in CHOP cells did not affect ABCA1 expression and abundance of ABCA1 protein.

Thus, introduction of CYP27A1 into cells stimulates cholesterol efflux and therefore may increase protection against atherosclerosis. apolipoprotein A-I gas chromatography mass spectrometry glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase The reverse cholesterol transport pathway removes excess cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues including vessel wall, thus preventing development of atherosclerosis. The first and most likely rate-limiting step of reverse cholesterol transport is cholesterol efflux, the transfer of cholesterol from cells to acceptors in plasma. Two key pathways of cholesterol efflux are currently known. The first involves lipidation of lipid-free or lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I),1 and is most likely mediated by the ABCA1 transporter (for review see Ref. 1Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). The second involves transfer of cholesterol from plasma membrane caveolae to lipidated apoA-I or mature high density lipoprotein (2Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Google Scholar) and may be mediated by scavenger receptor B1. Induction of ABCA1 (3Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34508-34511Google Scholar), scavenger receptor B1 (4de la Llera-Moya M. Connelly M.A. Drazul D. Klein S.M. Favari E. Yancey P.G. Williams D.L. Rothblat G.H. J.

A. 1997; 94: 3753-3758Google Scholar) results in a stimulation of cholesterol efflux. Cholesterol efflux may also be stimulated by inducing, or introducing into cells, elements of a pathway capable of cholesterol catabolism. Bjorkhem and co-workers (6Bjorkhem I. Andersson O.

Sjovall J. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Google Scholar) demonstrated that limited oxidation of cholesterol in human macrophages may represent such a mechanism; however, its contribution to overall cholesterol efflux remains unclear. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that expression of transfected sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) enhances efflux of non-oxidized cholesterol from cultured cells.DISCUSSIONOxidation of cholesterol in liver is the major pathway of cholesterol catabolism (21Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Google Scholar) resulting in formation of water-soluble bile acids and their subsequent excretion. It was assumed that liver is the only tissue capable of this process. Bjorkhem et al. (6Bjorkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Google Scholar) first suggested that this mechanism may not be unique for liver but may also be present in macrophages and endothelial cells, contributing therefore to the protection against cholesterol accumulation in the vessel wall (7Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjovall J. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Google Scholar, 22Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis the more hydrophilic 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid may be released from cells more readily (22Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Google Scholar). Cholestenoic acid may also be released to albumin instead of high density lipoprotein (24Babiker A. Diczfalusy U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 333-339Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by findings that a genetic CYP27A1 deficiency in humans (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) is associated with lipid deposition in connective tissue and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (6Bjorkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Google Scholar,25von Bahr S. Movin T. Papadogiannakis N. Pikuleva I. Ronnow P. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1129-1135Google Scholar), classic symptoms of deficiency of reverse cholesterol transport. In CYP27A1 knock-out mice, however, most abnormalities were localized in the liver with little effect of the gene deletion on cholesterol homeostasis in extrahepatic tissues (26Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of CYP27A1 in transgenic mice did not result in major changes in lipoprotein metabolism (27Meir K. Kitsberg D. Alkalay I. Szafer F. Rosen H. Shpitzen S. Avi L.B. Staels B. Fievet C. Meiner V. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34036-34041Google Scholar). These differences might be a result of profound dissimilarities in lipoprotein metabolism in mice and humans and may also reflect the need to distinguish between roles of CYP27A1 in liver and non-hepatic cells. We addressed this issue by overexpression of CYP27A1 in an in vitro system and measured cholesterol efflux.The major finding of this work is that transfection of cells with sterol 27-hydroxylase stimulates the efflux of non-oxidized cholesterol. The stimulation of cholesterol efflux could be explained by two mechanisms. First, the appearance of hydroxycholesterol in the plasma membrane may facilitate the release of cholesterol and/or 27-hydroxycholesterol to an acceptor in plasma. Second, 27-hydroxycholesterol or its derivative cholestenoic acid, may be a ligand of the liver X-activated receptor, which regulates a number of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, in particular ABCA1 (19Fu X. Menke J.G. Chen Y. Zhou G. MacNaul K.L. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Lund E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38378-38387Google Scholar). Several findings in our study point to the likelihood of the first mechanism. First, there was no significant increase of ABCA1 expression and abundance in transfected cells. Second, the effect of transfection was more pronounced with whole plasma than with lipid-free apoA-I. An opposite result would be expected if the enhanced cholesterol efflux would result from stimulation of the expression of ABCA1. Third, transfection mainly stimulated the rapid phase of the efflux,i.e. release of cholesterol already present in the plasma membrane (18Gaus K. Gooding J.J. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9363-9373Google Scholar), making involvement of pathways required for mobilization of intracellular cholesterol less likely. Fourth, treatment of cells with exogenous 27-hydroxycholesterol also stimulated cholesterol efflux, although to a lesser degree.It should be emphasized that only a small amount of 27-hydroxycholesterol (less than 3%) was formed after transfection with CYP27, and increased efflux was found to be mainly, if not entirely, because of stimulation of the efflux of non-oxidized cholesterol. We speculate that small amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol may change the properties of the plasma membrane and could trigger an increased partition of cholesterol into pools readily accessible to the efflux process e.g. caveolae. Consistent with our data Westman et al. (23Westman J. Kallin B. Bjorkhem I. Nilsson J. Diczfalusy U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Google Scholar) demonstrated that increased formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in cholesterol-laden macrophages was associated with increased efflux of both cholesterol and oxysterols. Another oxyderivative of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, was not released to the extracellular acceptor and inhibited efflux of cholesterol; the effect was most likely mediated by changes in lipid composition of the plasma membrane (28Gaus K. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13002-13014Google Scholar). However, the effect of 27-hydroxycholesterol or other cholesterol derivatives on genes other than ABCA1, regulated by the liver X-activated receptor and involved in lipid metabolism (for review see Ref. 29Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Google Scholar), cannot be excluded.In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that introduction of CYP27A1 into cultured cells results in a dramatic increase in cholesterol efflux. This finding has possible implications for the treatment of atherosclerosis where enhancing reverse cholesterol transport by inserting genes into cells of the vessel wall could be of benefit. Providing that cholesterol released from cells proceeds further along the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, this finding offers a potentially effective way to enhance protection against accumulation of cholesterol, development of atherosclerosis, and heart diseases. The reverse cholesterol transport pathway removes excess cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues including vessel wall, thus preventing development of atherosclerosis. The first and most likely rate-limiting step of reverse cholesterol transport is cholesterol efflux, the transfer of cholesterol from cells to acceptors in plasma. Two key pathways of cholesterol efflux are currently known. The first involves lipidation of lipid-free or lipid-poor apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I),1 and is most likely mediated by the ABCA1 transporter (for review see Ref. 1Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1173-1179Google Scholar). The second involves transfer of cholesterol from plasma membrane caveolae to lipidated apoA-I or mature high density lipoprotein (2Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 175-189Google Scholar) and may be mediated by scavenger receptor B1. Induction of ABCA1 (3Oram J.F. Lawn R.M. Garvin M.R. Wade D.P. J. Biol.

Bjorkhem et al. (6Bjorkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Google Scholar) first suggested that this mechanism may not be unique for liver but may also be present in macrophages and endothelial cells, contributing therefore to the protection against cholesterol accumulation in the vessel wall (7Lund E. Andersson O. Zhang J. Babiker A. Ahlborg G. Diczfalusy U. Einarsson K. Sjovall J. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Google Scholar, 22Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Google Scholar, 23Westman J. Kallin B. Bjorkhem I. Nilsson J. Diczfalusy U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis the more hydrophilic 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid may be released from cells more readily (22Babiker A. Andersson O. Lund E. Xiu R.J. Deeb S. Reshef A. Leitersdorf E. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26253-26261Google Scholar). Cholestenoic acid may also be released to albumin instead of high density lipoprotein (24Babiker A. Diczfalusy U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392: 333-339Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by findings that a genetic CYP27A1 deficiency in humans (cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) is associated with lipid deposition in connective tissue and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (6Bjorkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8592-8596Google Scholar,25von Bahr S. Movin T. Papadogiannakis N. Pikuleva I. Ronnow P. Diczfalusy U. Bjorkhem I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1129-1135Google Scholar), classic symptoms of deficiency of reverse cholesterol transport. In CYP27A1 knock-out mice, however, most abnormalities were localized in the liver with little effect of the gene deletion on cholesterol homeostasis in extrahepatic tissues (26Rosen H. Reshef A. Maeda N. Lippoldt A. Shpizen S. Triger L. Eggertsen G. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14805-14812Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of CYP27A1 in transgenic mice did not result in major changes in lipoprotein metabolism (27Meir K. Kitsberg D. Alkalay I. Szafer F. Rosen H. Shpitzen S. Avi L.B. Staels B. Fievet C. Meiner V. Bjorkhem I. Leitersdorf E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34036-34041Google Scholar). These differences might be a result of profound dissimilarities in lipoprotein metabolism in mice and humans and may also reflect the need to distinguish between roles of CYP27A1 in liver and non-hepatic cells. We addressed this issue by overexpression of CYP27A1 in an in vitro system and measured cholesterol efflux.The major finding of this work is that transfection of cells with sterol 27-hydroxylase stimulates the efflux of non-oxidized cholesterol. The stimulation of cholesterol efflux could be explained by two mechanisms. First, the appearance of hydroxycholesterol in the plasma membrane may facilitate the release of cholesterol and/or 27-hydroxycholesterol to an acceptor in plasma. Second, 27-hydroxycholesterol or its derivative cholestenoic acid, may be a ligand of the liver X-activated receptor, which regulates a number of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis, in particular ABCA1 (19Fu X. Menke J.G. Chen Y. Zhou G. MacNaul K.L. Wright S.D. Sparrow C.P. Lund E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38378-38387Google Scholar). Several findings in our study point to the likelihood of the first mechanism. First, there was no significant increase of ABCA1 expression and abundance in transfected cells. Second, the effect of transfection was more pronounced with whole plasma than with lipid-free apoA-I. An opposite result would be expected if the enhanced cholesterol efflux would result from stimulation of the expression of ABCA1. Third, transfection mainly stimulated the rapid phase of the efflux,i.e. release of cholesterol already present in the plasma membrane (18Gaus K. Gooding J.J. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9363-9373Google Scholar), making involvement of pathways required for mobilization of intracellular cholesterol less likely. Fourth, treatment of cells with exogenous 27-hydroxycholesterol also stimulated cholesterol efflux, although to a lesser degree.It should be emphasized that only a small amount of 27-hydroxycholesterol (less than 3%) was formed after transfection with CYP27, and increased efflux was found to be mainly, if not entirely, because of stimulation of the efflux of non-oxidized cholesterol. We speculate that small amounts of 27-hydroxycholesterol may change the properties of the plasma membrane and could trigger an increased partition of cholesterol into pools readily accessible to the efflux process e.g. caveolae. Consistent with our data Westman et al. (23Westman J. Kallin B. Bjorkhem I. Nilsson J. Diczfalusy U. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 554-561Google Scholar) demonstrated that increased formation of 27-hydroxycholesterol in cholesterol-laden macrophages was associated with increased efflux of both cholesterol and oxysterols. Another oxyderivative of cholesterol, 7-ketocholesterol, was not released to the extracellular acceptor and inhibited efflux of cholesterol; the effect was most likely mediated by changes in lipid composition of the plasma membrane (28Gaus K. Dean R.T. Kritharides L. Jessup W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13002-13014Google Scholar). However, the effect of 27-hydroxycholesterol or other cholesterol derivatives on genes other than ABCA1, regulated by the liver X-activated receptor and involved in lipid metabolism (for review see Ref. 29Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Google Scholar), cannot be excluded.In this paper we demonstrate for the first time that introduction of CYP27A1 into cultured cells results in a dramatic increase in cholesterol efflux. This finding has possible implications for the treatment of atherosclerosis where enhancing reverse cholesterol transport by inserting genes into cells of the vessel wall could be of benefit. Providing that cholesterol released from cells proceeds further along the reverse cholesterol transport pathway, this finding offers a potentially effective way to enhance protection against accumulation of cholesterol, development of atherosclerosis, and heart diseases.

Trimeric and tetrameric aggregates are also obtained. The two dimers and the higher oligomers also form without a lyophilization step. By keeping RNase A dissolved at a high concentration (generally 200 mg/ml) in various media at temperatures ranging from 23 to 70 °C for times varying from a few minutes to 2 h, various oligomers, in particular the two dimeric conformers, formed in quite different amounts, often inverting their relative quantities depending on the more or less severe unfolding conditions. When unfolding mainly concerned the N terminus of the protein, richer in hydrophilic residues, the N-dimer, formed by 3D domain swapping of the N-terminal α-helix of each monomer, prevailed over the C-dimer. Under more vigorous denaturing conditions, where also the C terminus of RNase A, richer in hydrophobic amino acids, unfolded, the C-dimer, formed by 3D domain swapping of the C-terminal β-strand, prevailed over the other, possibly because of the induction to aggregation promoted by the hydrophobic residues present in the C termini of the two monomers.

Severe human neurodegenerative diseases are in fact characterized by the presence of aggregated forms of proteins (β-amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, α-synuclein (a primary component of Lewy bodies) in Parkinson's disease, a definitely modified form of the prion protein in various transmissible encephalopathies, etc.), and protein aggregation also characterizes the so-called polyglutamine expansion diseases (Huntington's disease, Kennedy's disease, etc.) (1Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Bovine ribonuclease A is a structurally versatile protein, appropriate to study the manner in which a protein aggregates. By lyophilization from 40–50% acetic acid solutions, the protein aggregates in the form of several types of oligomers, ranging from dimers (2Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; : 217-222PubMed Google Scholar) to pentamers and possibly higher aggregates, each species existing in at least two conformational isomers produced in invariable different amounts (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two dimers of RNase A have been well characterized and shown to be 3D domain-swapped oligomers (5Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), with the domain swapping involving either the N or C terminus or both of each subunit. For one of the trimers (the quantitatively major one), a very plausible linear structure has been proposed (6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), whereas the crystal structure of the other shows a circular trimer, similar to a propeller, formed by the swapping of the C-terminal β-strand of each monomer (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Models for the putative structures of the two tetrameric conformers have also been proposed (4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Interestingly, RNase A also aggregates under relatively mild conditions. Park and Raines (9Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) reported that, at 37 and 65 °C and pH 6.5, it forms domain-swapped dimers, whereas many years ago it was shown that high substrate concentrations can induce the dimerization of RNase A (10Marzotto A. Galzigna L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1970; 137: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the 3D domain-swapping mechanism forming RNase A dimers or higher order aggregates may have implications for the formation of amyloid-like fibrils (5Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 793-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), and strong support for this idea is given by the recently reported dimerization through a 3D domain-swapping mechanism of the amyloidogenic protein cystatin C (12Janowski R. Kozak M. Jankowska E. Grzonka Z. Grubb A. Abrahamson M. Jaskolski M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and the human prion protein (13Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). We have studied here the oligomerization of RNase A occurring under various conditions that favor the unfolding and mobility of the N and/or C terminus of the protein, and therefore the domain swapping event, without a lyophilization step. Our aim was to contribute to the understanding of the 3D domain-swapping mechanism in protein aggregation. The aggregates, mainly the two dimeric conformers, but also higher order oligomers, formed in varying relative, often inverted proportions depending on the experimental conditions. Ribonuclease A from bovine pancreas (Type XII-A) was from Sigma. All chemicals were of the highest purity available. Superdex 75 HR10/30 and Source 15S HR10/10 and HR16/10 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Chromatographic experiments were performed with an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system. RNase A was dissolved in various media, and aggregation was performed as described below, always without a lyophilization step: (a) 20 or 40% ethanol in water and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (b) 20 or 40% ethanol in 0.08 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (c) 40% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)1in water and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (d) 40% acetic acid (pH ∼1) and an RNase A concentration of 66.7 mg/ml; (e) 5, 10, or 30% aqueous acetone and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (f) 40% aqueous acetone and an RNase A concentration of 170 mg/ml; (g) 0.05m glycine HCl buffer (pH 3) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (h) double-distilled water (pH 6.0) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (i) 0.02 m NaCl (pH 7) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (j) 0.0125m Na2B4O7 and 0.0152m HCl buffer (pH 8.5) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; (k) 0.05 mKCl/H3BO3 and 0.0208 m NaOH buffer (pH 9) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml; and (l) 0.05 m KCl/H3BO3 and 0.0437m NaOH buffer (pH 10) and an RNase A concentration of 200 mg/ml. Aliquots (2 μl) of each RNase A solution were maintained for appropriate times, ranging from minutes to hours, at the chosen temperature. At the end of each incubation time, 200 μl of 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7), preheated at the same temperature (sometimes at room temperature), were added, and the sample was brought to 0 °C. Aliquots of the RNase A solutions indicated above were also kept at 23 °C for the same times chosen for the experiments at 60 °C. At the end of each incubation time, 200 μl of 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) were added. After the treatment described above, each sample was frozen until used or applied to a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) at 23 °C. Elution was performed at 23 °C with the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.01–0.2 ml/min. Every aggregated species emerging from the column was identified by checking its elution position and comparing it with that of the well characterized oligomers obtained by the usual lyophilization procedure (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which were always used as standards. Analysis and separation of the various RNase A aggregates were performed under conditions identical to those described elsewhere (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Their identification was performed by comparison with the elution pattern of standard aggregates (see above). Each aggregate produced under the various experimental conditions was quantified by measuring the area of its peak appearing on the gel-filtration or ion-exchange chromatogram and calculating its percentage relative to the sum of the areas of the peaks of all RNase A species eluted, monomeric RNase A included. The values shown in the table and/or figures are the means ± S.D. of several determinations. Cathodic gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed according to Goldenberg (14Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 225-250Google Scholar) with slight modifications, using β-alanine/acetic acid buffer (pH 4). 12.5% polyacrylamide gels were run at 20 mA for 100–120 min at 4 °C. Fixing and staining were performed with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Identification of the aggregates was performed by comparison of their R Fvalues with those of the aggregates obtained by the lyophilization procedure, already well characterized and used here as standards. The thermal unfolding of RNase A was followed spectrophotometrically at 287 nm using a Beckman DU-650 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatically controlled water bath. The protein was dissolved in the various media at a concentration of ∼1.5 mg/ml. At each temperature, the absorbance values of the RNase A solution were determined every 2 min, for a total time of 60 min, until measurements became constant for at least 10 min. Lyophilization of RNase A from 40% acetic acid solutions produces two dimeric conformers at a rather invariable ratio of ∼1:4, one called in fact the “minor” dimer and the other the “major” dimer (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The minor dimer forms by 3D domain swapping of the N-terminal α-helix (residues 1–15) of the RNase A monomer (5Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and the major dimer forms by 3D domain swapping of the C-terminal β-strand (residues 116–124) of each RNase A subunit (6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here we have simply named them the N-dimer and C-dimer, respectively, on the basis of the mechanism of their formation (5Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). By the lyophilization procedure, higher oligomers of RNase A also form: two trimers in constant, quite invariable amounts (ratio 1.5:1), formerly called the major and minor trimers (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M.

Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), as well as two tetramers, a minor and a major one, forming at a ratio of 1:1.6 (4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, dimers and larger aggregates of RNase A also form under conditions that allow the unfolding of the N and/or C terminus of the protein, but without including a lyophilization step. Moreover, the relative proportions of the two dimers can change and even be inverted depending on the experimental conditions. The experiments were performed by maintaining native monomeric RNase A, dissolved at a high concentration (usually 200 mg/ml) in the various fluids described under “Experimental Procedures,” at temperatures ranging from 23 to 70 °C for times ranging from a few minutes to 2 h. The treatment was ended by diluting the incubation mixture 1:100 with 0.2m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7) and transferring it to an ice bath. The aggregates formed were separated by gel filtration. When necessary, each gel-filtered oligomeric species or the incubated mixtures as such were analyzed by ion-exchange chromatography. In both cases, identification of the various oligomers formed was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” i.e. by using the well characterized dimers, trimers, or tetramers (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 4Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), recently prepared, as standards. A control of the nature of the various oligomers was also performed, when necessary, by gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”). In all cases, the relative amounts of the two dimeric conformers and of the higher order oligomers were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1(A and B, blue lines) and TableI, a solution of RNase A (200 mg/ml) in 40% aqueous or buffered ethanol heated at 60 °C for 30 min produced, similar to the lyophilization procedure, the C-dimer in a higher amount and the N-dimer in a lower amount, the ratio of the former to the latter being ∼2:1 (lower than the 4:1 ratio usually found with the lyophilization procedure). Similar results were obtained when RNase A dissolved in 40% aqueous TFE was maintained at 60 °C for 30 min (C-dimer/N-dimer ratio of 2:1). Under identical conditions, significant amounts of trimers or tetramers also formed. Because these oligomers were collected by gel filtration and not by ion-exchange chromatography, no complete separation of the two conformers of each species was obtained. The trimers and tetramers indicated here (TableI) are therefore mixtures of the two trimeric and tetrameric conformers (3Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), respectively.Table IDimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric aggregates formed by RNase A dissolved in various media and kept for 30 min at 60 or 23 °CSolution of RNase A in:ND at 60 °CCD at 60 °CT at 60 °CTT at 60 °CND at 23 °CCD at 23 °CNo. of experiments60 °C23 °C%%%%%%40% aqueous ethanol8.40 ± 1.5916.52 ± 2.896.90 ± 1.773.28 ± 1.312.21 ± 0.670.82 ± 0.199740% buffered ethanolaWith 0.08 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7).8.48 ± 1.3317.11 ± 1.495.62 ± 0.891.90 ± 1.260.56 ± 0.400.31 ± 0.105440% aqueous TFE8.72 ± 1.5317.93 ± 1.046.21 ± 1.481.70 ± 0.581.73 ± 0.350.54 ± 0.185520% aqueous ethanol7.40 ± 2.446.24 ± 3.372.40 ± 1.580.79 ± 0.562.26 ± 0.480.65 ± 0.227820% buffered ethanolaWith 0.08 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.7).5.50 ± 0.702.74 ± 0.590.60 ± 0.3801.60 ± 0.310.52 ± 0.1233Gly-HCl buffer(pH 3)2.41 ± 0.140.80 ± 0.49001.89 ± 0.690.53 ± 0.2645dd H2O2.61 ± 1.021.50 ± 0.51002.20 ± 0.680.63 ± 0.24660.02 m NaCl(pH 7)2.21 ± 0.500.90 ± 0.31001.88 ± 0.610.57 ± 0.1655Borate bufferpH 8.53.41 ± 0.790.80 ± 0.31001.22 ± 0.200.08 ± 0.0364pH 9.03.53 ± 0.390.82 ± 0.34000.71 ± 0.100.05 ± 0.0395pH 104.19 ± 1.680.93 ± 0.47000.84 ± 0.430.05 ± 0.0210530% acetone4.73 ± 1.102.08 ± 1.061.10 ± 0.140.29 ± 0.073.23 ± 0.281.32 ± 0.265440% acetone5.01 ± 1.952.29 ± 1.311.06 ± 0.380.31 ± 0.112.40 ± 0.291.10 ± 0.5043The RNase A concentration in each fluid was 200 mg/ml, except in 40% acetone, for which the RNase A concentration was 170 mg/ml.

By incubating (60 °C, 30 min) RNase A dissolved in either 20% aqueous or buffered ethanol, as well as in many other fluids (Fig. 1,A and B, red lines; and Table I), we found instead that the relative proportions of the two dimers inverted, the N-dimer often prevailing over the C-dimer. Unexpectedly, oligomerization of the protein also occurred when incubation was performed at room temperature (23 °C). Under these conditions, the prevalence of the N-dimer over the C-dimer was observed in all cases, including RNase A solutions in 40% ethanol or TFE, although the aggregates often formed in quite modest amounts (Fig. 1, Aand B, green lines; and Table I). It is also worth mentioning that incubation of a 10-fold less concentrated RNase A solution (20 mg/ml) in 40% ethanol or TFE at 60 °C gave only traces of dimers. This points out the importance of protein concentration in the aggregation process. To analyze the results described in more detail, we studied the formation of RNase A oligomers by incubating solutions of the protein in 40% aqueous ethanol for up to 2 h at 45, 50, or 60 °C. By analyzing aliquots withdrawn from the incubation mixture at the times indicated, we obtained the results presented in Fig. 2. Fig.2 A shows RNase A aggregation at 45 °C. At this temperature, the reaction did not reach equilibrium even after 2 h of incubation. The modest amounts of oligomers formed regularly increased with time; and the N-dimer was definitely prevalent over the C-dimer. Small amounts of trimers also appeared after 70 min of incubation. A notable point is that, at zero time, i.e.during the short time necessary to prepare the incubation mixture at room temperature (23 °C) and to transfer an aliquot of it to an ice bath, RNase A appeared to aggregate quite efficiently, with the N-dimer and C-dimer reaching amounts of 3.4 and 1.2%, respectively. However, after some minutes at 45 °C, the amount of both aggregates decreased, as if they were dissociated. It is worth pointing out that, from these and other results, it appears that RNase A has a remarkable propensity to oligomerize (see also Ref. 9Park C. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and this propensity might even increase after some treatment. This could be the reason why commercial preparations of RNase A are sometimes found to contain considerable amounts of aggregated material (15Libonati M. Ital. J. Biochem. 1969; 18: 407-417PubMed Google Scholar). At 50 °C (Fig. 2 B), oligomerization was more conspicuous, reaching equilibrium after 60 min of incubation. Although the experimental data appear to be highly variable between ∼5 and 30 min, an inversion of the relative proportions of the N-dimer and C-dimer seemed to occur after 35 min. At 60 °C (Fig. 2 C), definitely larger amounts of all oligomeric species were produced, and the quantity of the C-dimer was always remarkably higher than that of the N-dimer. At 60 min of incubation, the relative amounts were 9.7% for the N-dimer and 16.4% for the C-dimer. Their ratio (1:1.7) is far from the 1:4 ratio usually obtained with the lyophilization procedure. The RNase A trimer, already formed at 45 °C (Fig. 2 A), became more abundant at 50 °C (Fig. 2 B) and definitely increased at 60 °C (Fig. 2 C). After 1 h of incubation, it was present at 9.7%, identical to the N-dimer. At the same time, the quantity of tetramers formed, negligible at 50 °C (Fig. 2 B), was ∼5% at 60 °C (Fig. 2 C). No significant increase in the amount of the two dimers and the higher order aggregates occurred after 60 min of incubation. A similar pattern of oligomerization was found upon incubation at 60 °C of RNase A dissolved in 40% TFE (Fig.3). After 60 min, the formation of the C-dimer (∼17% at 60 min) was remarkably favored over that of the N-dimer (7.6%), as well as over that of the trimeric and tetrameric species (7.8, and 2.7%, respectively), the amounts of which were lower than the amounts found in 40% ethanol at the same temperature (Fig.2 C). The pattern of the oligomerization of RNase A under these conditions (Fig. 4), which was rather similar to the pattern observed at 50 °C in 40% ethanol (Fig. 2 B), reveals that these two conditions are qualitatively equivalent and indeed critical (see also Table I) for the aggregation process. They appear to be a transition point between the experimental conditions favoring the prevalence of one or the other of the two dimers. In conclusion, under these conditions, the quantities of the two dimers fluctuated around an average value of ∼50% of each conformer (see also Fig. 1, A andB, solid and dashed red lines). Because of its significance, the analysis of RNase A aggregation in 20% ethanol at 60 °C was repeated, but the two conformers were separated by ion-exchange chromatography. The results of four different experiments (data not shown) are in very good agreement with those obtained by gel filtration. The transition profiles for the thermal unfolding of RNase A dissolved in many of the fluids used in the experiments described were determined spectrophotometrically at 287 nm and are shown in Fig.5. The decrease in absorbance (16Tsong T.Y. Baldwin R.L. Elson E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Tsong T.Y. Baldwin R.L. McPhie P. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10131-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) is ascribable to the increased exposure of tyrosine residues as a function of the increase in temperature. Recent studies using Tyr-to-Phe mutants have assigned the absorbance change upon unfolding largely to three buried tyrosines at positions 25, 92, and 97 (18). Therefore, the steep changes in absorbance detected (Fig. 5) should reasonably be essentially ascribed to the global unfolding of the whole protein. However, Tyr115, located in the hinge loop of the RNase A C terminus (residues 112–115) (6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), might also be important in the absorbance changes that occur in the unfolding events leading to C-dimer formation. The temperatures at which the absorbance inflections occurred (Fig. 5) varied under different conditions: when RNase A was dissolved in 40% aqueous TFE or ethanol, the absorbance lowering took place at lower temperatures, whereas under milder conditions (borate buffer at pH 8.5 or 10, double-distilled water, etc.), the absorbance changes shifted toward higher temperatures. Therefore, the correlation between RNase A unfolding and the prevalence of one or the other dimeric conformer is clear: under conditions in which the absorbance lowering occurs definitely below 60 °C, the C-dimer, formed by the C-terminal end-swapping mechanism (6Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), is produced in higher amounts. This means that unfolding occurs at both the N and C termini of the protein. Under milder conditions in which the absorbance lowering occurs above 60 °C, the N-dimer is more abundant, indicating the prevalent unfolding (and swapping) of the N terminus of RNase A. Under intermediate conditions (20% ethanol at 60 °C and 40% ethanol at 50 °C) in which absorbance changes in the protein occur just below or close to 60 °C, the amounts of the two dimeric conformers become similar, possibly indicating that the unfolding events occurring at the N and C termini of RNase A are equivalent, as well as the energy requirements for the two aggregation events occurring via 3D domain swapping. The steep absorbance inflection related to the unfolding of RNase A in 40% TFE occurred at ∼32 °C (Fig. 5). To further analyze the correlation between the thermal unfolding of the protein and the yield of one or the other dimeric conformer, the oligomerization process was studied at a concentration of 200 mg/ml RNase A in 40% aqueous TFE heated at lower temperatures (30–45 °C) for 120 min. The results obtained are shown in Table II. Although the amount of the N-dimer was higher at 30 °C than that of the C-dimer at any time of incubation, an inversion of their relative proportions possibly occurred between 30 and 32 °C. At 32 °C, as well as at 35 °C and even more at 45 °C, the amount of the C-dimer became definitely higher than that of the N-dimer. Moreover, by comparing the results obtained upon the aggregation of RNase A under all conditions used (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Tables Table I, Table II, Table III, Table IV) with the relative absorbance inflections detected (Fig. 5), the correlation mentioned above appears to be confirmed.Table IIFormation of dimeric aggregates by RNase A dissolved in 40% TFE as a function of time and temperatureT5 min15 min30 min60 min120 minNDCDNDCDNDCDNDCDNDCD°C%%%%%300.480.140.680.270.330.120.590.170.770.19320.280.331.001.700.841.660.701.601.281.84351.762.391.361.492.126.551.993.981.563.15451.865.802.288.333.019.492.979.433.1210.07Eppendorf tubes containing 2 μl of a solution of RNase A in 40% TFE (concentration of 200 mg/ml) prepared at 23 °C"

However, the functional consequences of these mutations have not been studied. In the present report, we evaluated the effect of overexpression of these mutants on melanosome, melanophilin, and myosin-Va localization in B16 melanoma cells. Then we studied several key parameters for Rab27a function, including GTP binding and interaction with melanophilin/myosin-Va complex, which links melanosomes to the actin network. Our results showed that Rab27a-L130P cannot bind GTP, does not interact with melanophilin, and consequently cannot allow melanosome transport on the actin filaments. Interestingly, Rab27a-W73G binds GTP but does not interact with melanophilin. Thus, Rab27a-W73G cannot support the actin-dependent melanosome transport. Finally, Rab27a-A152P binds both GTP and melanophilin. However, Rab27a-A152P does not allow melanosome transport and acts as a dominant negative mutant, because its overexpression, in B16 melanoma cells, mimics a GS phenotype. Hence, the interaction of Rab27a with melanophilin/myosin-Va is not sufficient to ensure a correct melanosome transport.

Griscelli syndrome green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline wild-type Griscelli syndrome (GS)1 is a rare genodermatosis, characterized by pigmentary dilution of skin and hair, presence of large clumps of pigment in hair shafts, and accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes. These symptoms are associated with either neurological abnormalities in type 1 GS or immunodeficiency in type 2 GS (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar). Morphological and biochemical studies have shown that pigmentary disorders are related to a defect of melanosome transport in melanocytes, whereas neurological abnormalities are associated with a defect in axonal transport in neurons, and immune diseases are associated with a reduced lytic granules secretion in T lymphocytes.GS has been mapped to 15q21, the region where MYOVA(myosin-Va gene) is located (2Pastural E. Barrat F.J. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Certain S. Sanal O. Jabado N. Seger R. Griscelli C. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 289-292Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical data have identified MYOVA as the first gene involved in GS. Mutations in MYOVA and in its murine counterpart are responsible for GS type 1 (2Pastural E. Barrat F.J. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Certain S. Sanal O. Jabado N. Seger R. Griscelli C. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 289-292Google Scholar) and dilutemouse phenotype (3Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Google Scholar), respectively. Myosin-Va is a molecular motor that binds to actin filaments through its N-terminal head domain and to the cargo through its C-terminal globular tail (4Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Google Scholar, 5Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In melanocytes, myosin-Va participates in the transport of melanosomes to the distal part of the dendrites (7Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Google Scholar, 8Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Google Scholar). However, several GS patients had no mutation in MYOVA, suggesting that other genes may be responsible for this disease (9Pastural E. Ersoy F. Yalman N. Wulffraat N. Grillo E. Ozkinay F. Tezcan I. Gedikoglu G. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Genomics. 2000; 63: 299-306Google Scholar). Confirming this point, mutations in the Rab27a gene have been identified in patients with type 2 GS (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar) and the corresponding mouse model ashen (10Wilson S.M. Yip R. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Zhang Y. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7933-7938Google Scholar).Recently the gene mutated in leaden mice, which presents the same pigmentary features as dilute and ashenmice, has been discovered. The leaden locus encodes for a synaptotagmin-like protein, Mlph (melanophilin) (11Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Google Scholar). However, to date, no human disease has been related to MLPH mutation. Very recent studies have reported that melanophilin, also called Slac2a, interacts through its N-terminal domain with GTP-bound Rab27a whereas the C-terminal domain interacts with myosin-Va (6Wu X.S.

Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the myosin-Va interaction with melanophilin is dependent on the presence of the alternatively spliced exon F at the C-terminal globular tail of myosin-Va, expressed in melanocytes (6Wu X.S.

A simplified scheme is shown on Fig. 1 A.Among the 18 previously described GS patients, 16 had mutations inRAB27A. Most of these mutations were nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to a premature stop codon that predicted a truncation of the C-terminal geranylgeranylation motif, which is required for correct vesicular targeting. Therefore, the resulting Rab27a proteins could not be functional. Alternatively, some of these mutations altered mRNA or protein stability and resulted in the absence of Rab27a protein (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar).Interestingly, three GS patients had single homozygous missense mutation in RAB27A, leading to W73G, L130P, or A152P transitions that affect highly conserved residues among Rab proteins (Fig. 1 B). To understand the mechanisms by which these mutations cause a defect in melanosome transport, we have analyzed the behavior of these mutants at molecular and functional levels.The results gathered in the present report allowed the identification of the molecular defect caused by W73G and L130P transitions in Rab27a. Neither of these mutants bind melanophilin and, consequently, cannot connect melanosomes to myosin-Va and the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, these mutants are not able to support melanosome transport to the dendrite tips. Although we have not been able to identify the molecular defect caused by A152P transition in Rab27a, our results point to the crucial role of alanine 152 in a Rab27a function other than GTP binding or melanophilin interaction.DISCUSSIONRab27a, which links melanosomes to the actin network, plays a crucial role in melanosome transport. Therefore, it is easy to understand that in the absence of Rab27a, melanosomes cannot be transported and accumulated at dendrite tips. However, three patients with type 2 GS have missense mutations in RAB27A that allow the expression of the Rab27a protein but not the targeting of melanosomes to dendrite tips, because these patients have a pigmentary dilution (17Bahadoran P. Aberdam E. Mantoux F. Busca R. Bille K. Yalman N. de Saint-Basile G. Casaroli-Marano R. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 843-850Google Scholar). To gain more information on the role and the function of Rab27a in melanosome transport, we performed a detailed study of Rab27a mutants W73G, L130P, and A152A found in type 2 GS patients.In the first part of this report, we performed a basic study of melanosomes and associated molecules in B16 melanoma cells. Melanosomes labeled with an anti-Tyrp1 antibody, as well as Rab27a and myosin-Va, showed a strong co-localization with melanophilin. Furthermore, intact melanosome immunoprecipitation demonstrated a physical association between these vesicles and Rab27a, melanophilin, or myosin-Va.As demonstrated previously (6Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Google Scholar, 15Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer III, J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1735-1749Google Scholar, 18Wu X. Rao K. Bowers M.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Google Scholar) in other melanocyte cell systems, we observed that the overexpression of the myosin-Va C-terminal tail acts as a dominant negative mutant that impairs melanosome recruitment at dendrite extremities. Indeed, this myosin-Va tail construct is able to bind melanosomes, but not to actin, and thus cannot support the recruitment of melanosomes at dendrite tips by peripheric actin filaments. Transfection of Rab27a mutants N133I and Q78L also induced a mislocalization of melanosomes. The effect of Rab27a-N133I, which has been described as a dominant negative, GDP-bound Rab27a mutant (19Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Google Scholar), was somehow expected. However, the effect of the Q78L mutant was more intriguing. This mutant was supposed to be a GTP-bound Rab27a and act as a constitutive active mutant. Indeed, we demonstrated that Rab27a-Q78L bound GTP and melanophilin but was not targeted to the membrane compartment (not shown) and thus cannot reach the melanosome. This mutant acts as a dominant negative mutant by preventing the interaction of the endogenous Rab27a with its effector, melanophilin.Interestingly, we observed that overexpression of the myosin-Va tail also impairs Rab27a and melanophilin localization at dendrite tips. These results are in agreement with the perinuclear re-localization of Slp2, another Rab27a effector member of the melanophilin/slac2a family, observed in Ser-91 cells derived from dilute mice (13Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Google Scholar). In the same way, overexpression of Rab27a-N133I and Rab27a-Q78L induced a relocalization of melanophilin and myosin-Va to the perinuclear area. These observations indicate that the tripartite molecular complexes are transported together with melanosomes to the dendrite tips and suggest that the interaction of Rab27a/melanophilin with myosin-Va would allow or favor the interaction of the molecular motor with the actin network.Next, we focused our attention on Rab27a mutants found in GS patients. The proximity of Leu-130 and Asn-133 residues incited us to predict that both mutants would have the same behavior. Nevertheless, the sequence comparison between Rab27a and Rab3a shows that Leu-130 in Rab27a is situated in very close proximity to the third GTP binding site, but it is not exactly situated within this consensus sequence. The overexpression of the Rab27a-L130P mutant blocked melanosome, melanophilin, and myosin-Va transport to the dendrite tips. This mutant was unable to bind GTP and did not associate with melanophilin or myosin-Va. Therefore, Rab27a-L130P cannot connect its cargo with the actin network. Further, Rab27a-L130P did not show a vesicular distribution, thus suggesting that it might not be targeted to the melanosome membrane. Rab27a-L130P, like Rab27a-N133I, acts as a dominant negative mutant of Rab27a, because both mutants are predominantly in a GDP-bound form and are supposed to bind avidly to their exchange factor, thereby impairing the activation of the endogenous Rab27a.Further, the Trp-73 is in the vicinity of the Gln-78 that plays a crucial role in the GTPase activity of Rab27a. This observation initially prompted us to hypothesize that both Rab27a-W73G and Rab27a-Q78L would have a similar behavior. However, Rab27a-W73G mutant did not impair melanosome, melanophilin, or myosin-Va localization at dendrites tips. Rab27a-W73G did not present a vesicular distribution and did not co-localize with Tyrp1, Mlph, or myosin-Va, indicating that the protein is not correctly targeted to the melanosome membranes. Interestingly, Rab27a-W73G was able to bind GTP but did not interact with melanophilin or myosin-Va.A closer look at the Rab27a sequence revealed that Trp-73 lies very close to but is not included within the GTPase activity region of Rab27a. The comparison of the molecular structures of Rab27a and Rab3a has shown that the Trp-73 in Rab27a corresponds to the Trp-76 in Rab3a that is responsible for the direct interaction of Rab3a with its effector Rabphilin-3a. This tryptophan residue is very conserved within many Rab proteins (20Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar), and together with two other amino acids, Phe-59 and Asp-91, forms a hydrophobic triad that seems to generally allow the stabilization of the interaction between the Rab protein and its effector (21Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Google Scholar). It has also been shown that a single missense mutation in the Rab3Aa sequence (V55E), which does not affect the GTP/GDP binding, specifically inhibits the Rab3a interaction with another effector, RIM (22Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Fortner K.A. Stabila P. Holz R.W. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1137-1143Google Scholar). Taken together, these arguments indicate that the W73G mutation in Rab27a impairs the association of the Rab protein with the melanophilin/myosin-Va complex.When transfected, Rab27a-W73G cannot impair the interaction of the endogenous wild-type Rab27a, expressed in B16 cells, with melanophilin and thereby cannot affect melanosome transport. Nevertheless, the GS patient with homozygous W73G mutation expresses only Rab27a-W73G. Because this mutant does not bind melanophilin, it cannot support peripheral melanosome transport.Because the region containing the residue 152 is not included in any known putative Rab GTP/GDP or effector binding sites, no predictive hypothesis on the molecular behavior of Rab27a-A152P can be proposed. Rab27a-A152P also acted as a dominant interfering mutant, because it hindered melanosomes as well as melanophilin and myosin-Va localization to the dendrite tips. Rab27a-A152P binds GTP and is able to associate with melanophilin and myosin-Va. This mutant showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization that did not overlap with the Tyrp1 labeling, suggesting that Rab27a-A152P is not targeted to melanosome. Thus Rab27a-A152P behaves as Rab27a-Q78L, suggesting that Rab27a-A152P could be a GTPase-defective mutant.It is however worth remarking that Ala-152 residue is conserved among many Rab proteins. The Ala-152 residue of Rab27a corresponds to an Ala-154 in Rab3A. This residue is found located in an α-helix without any known function (20Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar, 23Chen D. Guo J. Miki T. Tachibana M. Gahl W.A. Biochem. Mol Med. 1997; 60: 27-37Google Scholar). It is possible that the change of an alanine by a proline in the α-helix breaks the helicoidal structure of the region, thereby changing the conformation of the protein and affecting the Rab27a association with other effectors. Indeed it now appears clear that Rab proteins can bind to several effectors at the same time. For example, Rab3a associates to Rabphilin-3A and the RIM protein (24Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Google Scholar). Rab5a binds to Rabaptin-5, to Rabenosyn-5, and to the protein EE1 (25Deneka M. van Der Sluijs P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E33-E35Google Scholar). Further, several very recent reports (13Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Google Scholar, 14Strom M. Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Barkagianni E. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Google Scholar, 26Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43096-43103Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Google Scholar, 28Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 899-906Google Scholar) have shown the existence of at least five Rab27a effectors that belong, as melanophilin, to the synaptotagmin-like family. Thus A152P mutation could impair the association with one of these effectors without affecting the interaction with melanophilin. Alternatively, disruption of the α-helix could directly affect Rab27a targeting to the melanosome. These hypotheses remain to be verified.It is noteworthy that the Rab27a mutants have been transfected in B16 melanoma cells that express endogenous wild-type Rab27a. The dominant negative effect can observed only when the mutants are strongly overexpressed. Indeed, Griscelli syndrome is a recessive genodermatosis. In heterozygous subjects, the expression of one Rab27a wild-type allele is sufficient for correct melanosome transport.Interestingly, it should be noted that the patient with the mutation A152P developed the first episode of hemophagocytic syndrome at 8 years old, whereas in most of the other patients with Rab27a mutations, the first episode occurred before 6 months (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar). Thus, the A152P mutation in Rab27a might be less detrimental for the immune homeostasis. This Rab27a region would therefore play a more important role in melanosome transport than in cytotoxic granule exocytosis, suggesting that melanocyte- or melanosome-specific effectors could interact with this region. At present, no experimental results have brought evidence for this hypothesis, and further studies will be needed to understand the mechanisms by which the A152P mutation within the Rab27a protein leads to the observed clinical and biological defects.In summary, the study of these three GS Rab27a mutants allows us to explain the molecular mechanisms that lead to the abnormal pigmentation phenotypes of these GS patients. Further, our results point to an unexpected complexity of the Rab27a function, because, at least for the Rab27a-A152P mutant, interaction with melanophilin/myosin-Va, GTP binding is not sufficient to ensure a correct melanosome transport. These observations open the way to the search for new Rab27a effectors or regulators that might control the transport of Rab27a-dependent vesicles. Griscelli syndrome (GS)1 is a rare genodermatosis, characterized by pigmentary dilution of skin and hair, presence of large clumps of pigment in hair shafts, and accumulation of melanosomes in melanocytes. These symptoms are associated with either neurological abnormalities in type 1 GS or immunodeficiency in type 2 GS (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar). Morphological and biochemical studies have shown that pigmentary disorders are related to a defect of melanosome transport in melanocytes, whereas neurological abnormalities are associated with a defect in axonal transport in neurons, and immune diseases are associated with a reduced lytic granules secretion in T lymphocytes. GS has been mapped to 15q21, the region where MYOVA(myosin-Va gene) is located (2Pastural E. Barrat F.J. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Certain S. Sanal O. Jabado N. Seger R. Griscelli C. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 289-292Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical data have identified MYOVA as the first gene involved in GS. Mutations in MYOVA and in its murine counterpart are responsible for GS type 1 (2Pastural E. Barrat F.J. Dufourcq-Lagelouse R. Certain S. Sanal O. Jabado N. Seger R. Griscelli C. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 289-292Google Scholar) and dilutemouse phenotype (3Mercer J.A. Seperack P.K. Strobel M.C. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 709-713Google Scholar), respectively. Myosin-Va is a molecular motor that binds to actin filaments through its N-terminal head domain and to the cargo through its C-terminal globular tail (4Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Google Scholar, 5Reck-Peterson S.L. Provance Jr., D.W. Mooseker M.S. Mercer J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

In melanocytes, myosin-Va participates in the transport of melanosomes to the distal part of the dendrites (7Marks M.S. Seabra M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 738-748Google Scholar, 8Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1899-1918Google Scholar). However, several GS patients had no mutation in MYOVA, suggesting that other genes may be responsible for this disease (9Pastural E. Ersoy F. Yalman N. Wulffraat N. Grillo E. Ozkinay F. Tezcan I. Gedikoglu G. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Saint Basile G. Genomics. 2000; 63: 299-306Google Scholar). Confirming this point, mutations in the Rab27a gene have been identified in patients with type 2 GS (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar) and the corresponding mouse model ashen (10Wilson S.M. Yip R. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Zhang Y. Novak E.K. Swank R.T. Russell L.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7933-7938Google Scholar). Recently the gene mutated in leaden mice, which presents the same pigmentary features as dilute and ashenmice, has been discovered. The leaden locus encodes for a synaptotagmin-like protein, Mlph (melanophilin) (11Matesic L.E. Yip R. Reuss A.E. Swing D.A. O'Sullivan T.N. Fletcher C.F. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10238-10243Google Scholar). However, to date, no human disease has been related to MLPH mutation. Very recent studies have reported that melanophilin, also called Slac2a, interacts through its N-terminal domain with GTP-bound Rab27a whereas the C-terminal domain interacts with myosin-Va (6Wu X.S.

Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the myosin-Va interaction with melanophilin is dependent on the presence of the alternatively spliced exon F at the C-terminal globular tail of myosin-Va, expressed in melanocytes (6Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Google Scholar, 15Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer III, J.A. Mol.

Dermatol. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus, melanophilin, Rab27a, and myosin-Va constitute a molecular tripartite complex that controls melanosome distal transport and dendrite targeting. A simplified scheme is shown on Fig. 1 A. Among the 18 previously described GS patients, 16 had mutations inRAB27A. Most of these mutations were nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to a premature stop codon that predicted a truncation of the C-terminal geranylgeranylation motif, which is required for correct vesicular targeting. Therefore, the resulting Rab27a proteins could not be functional. Alternatively, some of these mutations altered mRNA or protein stability and resulted in the absence of Rab27a protein (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar). Interestingly, three GS patients had single homozygous missense mutation in RAB27A, leading to W73G, L130P, or A152P transitions that affect highly conserved residues among Rab proteins (Fig. 1 B). To understand the mechanisms by which these mutations cause a defect in melanosome transport, we have analyzed the behavior of these mutants at molecular and functional levels.

DISCUSSIONRab27a, which links melanosomes to the actin network, plays a crucial role in melanosome transport. Therefore, it is easy to understand that in the absence of Rab27a, melanosomes cannot be transported and accumulated at dendrite tips.

Because this mutant does not bind melanophilin, it cannot support peripheral melanosome transport.Because the region containing the residue 152 is not included in any known putative Rab GTP/GDP or effector binding sites, no predictive hypothesis on the molecular behavior of Rab27a-A152P can be proposed. Rab27a-A152P also acted as a dominant interfering mutant, because it hindered melanosomes as well as melanophilin and myosin-Va localization to the dendrite tips. Rab27a-A152P binds GTP and is able to associate with melanophilin and myosin-Va. This mutant showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization that did not overlap with the Tyrp1 labeling, suggesting that Rab27a-A152P is not targeted to melanosome. Thus Rab27a-A152P behaves as Rab27a-Q78L, suggesting that Rab27a-A152P could be a GTPase-defective mutant.It is however worth remarking that Ala-152 residue is conserved among many Rab proteins. The Ala-152 residue of Rab27a corresponds to an Ala-154 in Rab3A. This residue is found located in an α-helix without any known function (20Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar, 23Chen D. Guo J. Miki T. Tachibana M. Gahl W.A. Biochem. Mol Med. 1997; 60: 27-37Google Scholar). It is possible that the change of an alanine by a proline in the α-helix breaks the helicoidal structure of the region, thereby changing the conformation of the protein and affecting the Rab27a association with other effectors. Indeed it now appears clear that Rab proteins can bind to several effectors at the same time. For example, Rab3a associates to Rabphilin-3A and the RIM protein (24Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Google Scholar). Rab5a binds to Rabaptin-5, to Rabenosyn-5, and to the protein EE1 (25Deneka M. van Der Sluijs P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E33-E35Google Scholar). Further, several very recent reports (13Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Google Scholar, 14Strom M. Hume A.N. Tarafder A.K. Barkagianni E. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25423-25430Google Scholar, 26Fukuda M. Kuroda T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43096-43103Google Scholar, 27Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40118-40124Google Scholar, 28Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 899-906Google Scholar) have shown the existence of at least five Rab27a effectors that belong, as melanophilin, to the synaptotagmin-like family. Thus A152P mutation could impair the association with one of these effectors without affecting the interaction with melanophilin. Alternatively, disruption of the α-helix could directly affect Rab27a targeting to the melanosome. These hypotheses remain to be verified.It is noteworthy that the Rab27a mutants have been transfected in B16 melanoma cells that express endogenous wild-type Rab27a. The dominant negative effect can observed only when the mutants are strongly overexpressed. Indeed, Griscelli syndrome is a recessive genodermatosis. In heterozygous subjects, the expression of one Rab27a wild-type allele is sufficient for correct melanosome transport.Interestingly, it should be noted that the patient with the mutation A152P developed the first episode of hemophagocytic syndrome at 8 years old, whereas in most of the other patients with Rab27a mutations, the first episode occurred before 6 months (1Menasche G. Pastural E. Feldmann J. Certain S. Ersoy F. Dupuis S. Wulffraat N. Bianchi D. Fischer A. Le Deist F. de Saint Basile G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 173-176Google Scholar). Thus, the A152P mutation in Rab27a might be less detrimental for the immune homeostasis. This Rab27a region would therefore play a more important role in melanosome transport than in cytotoxic granule exocytosis, suggesting that melanocyte- or melanosome-specific effectors could interact with this region. At present, no experimental results have brought evidence for this hypothesis, and further studies will be needed to understand the mechanisms by which the A152P mutation within the Rab27a protein leads to the observed clinical and biological defects.In summary, the study of these three GS Rab27a mutants allows us to explain the molecular mechanisms that lead to the abnormal pigmentation phenotypes of these GS patients. Further, our results point to an unexpected complexity of the Rab27a function, because, at least for the Rab27a-A152P mutant, interaction with melanophilin/myosin-Va, GTP binding is not sufficient to ensure a correct melanosome transport. These observations open the way to the search for new Rab27a effectors or regulators that might control the transport of Rab27a-dependent vesicles. Rab27a, which links melanosomes to the actin network, plays a crucial role in melanosome transport. Therefore, it is easy to understand that in the absence of Rab27a, melanosomes cannot be transported and accumulated at dendrite tips. However, three patients with type 2 GS have missense mutations in RAB27A that allow the expression of the Rab27a protein but not the targeting of melanosomes to dendrite tips, because these patients have a pigmentary dilution (17Bahadoran P. Aberdam E. Mantoux F. Busca R. Bille K. Yalman N. de Saint-Basile G. Casaroli-Marano R. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 843-850Google Scholar). To gain more information on the role and the function of Rab27a in melanosome transport, we performed a detailed study of Rab27a mutants W73G, L130P, and A152A found in type 2 GS patients. In the first part of this report, we performed a basic study of melanosomes and associated molecules in B16 melanoma cells. Melanosomes labeled with an anti-Tyrp1 antibody, as well as Rab27a and myosin-Va, showed a strong co-localization with melanophilin. Furthermore, intact melanosome immunoprecipitation demonstrated a physical association between these vesicles and Rab27a, melanophilin, or myosin-Va. As demonstrated previously (6Wu X.S. Rao K. Zhang H. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Matesic L.E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 271-278Google Scholar, 15Wu X. Wang F. Rao K. Sellers J.R. Hammer III, J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1735-1749Google Scholar, 18Wu X. Rao K. Bowers M.B. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Hammer III, J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Google Scholar) in other melanocyte cell systems, we observed that the overexpression of the myosin-Va C-terminal tail acts as a dominant negative mutant that impairs melanosome recruitment at dendrite extremities. Indeed, this myosin-Va tail construct is able to bind melanosomes, but not to actin, and thus cannot support the recruitment of melanosomes at dendrite tips by peripheric actin filaments. Transfection of Rab27a mutants N133I and Q78L also induced a mislocalization of melanosomes. The effect of Rab27a-N133I, which has been described as a dominant negative, GDP-bound Rab27a mutant (19Hume A.N. Collinson L.M. Rapak A. Gomes A.Q. Hopkins C.R. Seabra M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 795-808Google Scholar), was somehow expected. However, the effect of the Q78L mutant was more intriguing. This mutant was supposed to be a GTP-bound Rab27a and act as a constitutive active mutant. Indeed, we demonstrated that Rab27a-Q78L bound GTP and melanophilin but was not targeted to the membrane compartment (not shown) and thus cannot reach the melanosome. This mutant acts as a dominant negative mutant by preventing the interaction of the endogenous Rab27a with its effector, melanophilin. Interestingly, we observed that overexpression of the myosin-Va tail also impairs Rab27a and melanophilin localization at dendrite tips. These results are in agreement with the perinuclear re-localization of Slp2, another Rab27a effector member of the melanophilin/slac2a family, observed in Ser-91 cells derived from dilute mice (13Kuroda T.S. Fukuda M. Ariga H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9212-9218Google Scholar). In the same way, overexpression of Rab27a-N133I and Rab27a-Q78L induced a relocalization of melanophilin and myosin-Va to the perinuclear area. These observations indicate that the tripartite molecular complexes are transported together with melanosomes to the dendrite tips and suggest that the interaction of Rab27a/melanophilin with myosin-Va would allow or favor the interaction of the molecular motor with the actin network. Next, we focused our attention on Rab27a mutants found in GS patients. The proximity of Leu-130 and Asn-133 residues incited us to predict that both mutants would have the same behavior. Nevertheless, the sequence comparison between Rab27a and Rab3a shows that Leu-130 in Rab27a is situated in very close proximity to the third GTP binding site, but it is not exactly situated within this consensus sequence. The overexpression of the Rab27a-L130P mutant blocked melanosome, melanophilin, and myosin-Va transport to the dendrite tips. This mutant was unable to bind GTP and did not associate with melanophilin or myosin-Va. Therefore, Rab27a-L130P cannot connect its cargo with the actin network. Further, Rab27a-L130P did not show a vesicular distribution, thus suggesting that it might not be targeted to the melanosome membrane. Rab27a-L130P, like Rab27a-N133I, acts as a dominant negative mutant of Rab27a, because both mutants are predominantly in a GDP-bound form and are supposed to bind avidly to their exchange factor, thereby impairing the activation of the endogenous Rab27a. Further, the Trp-73 is in the vicinity of the Gln-78 that plays a crucial role in the GTPase activity of Rab27a. This observation initially prompted us to hypothesize that both Rab27a-W73G and Rab27a-Q78L would have a similar behavior. However, Rab27a-W73G mutant did not impair melanosome, melanophilin, or myosin-Va localization at dendrites tips. Rab27a-W73G did not present a vesicular distribution and did not co-localize with Tyrp1, Mlph, or myosin-Va, indicating that the protein is not correctly targeted to the melanosome membranes. Interestingly, Rab27a-W73G was able to bind GTP but did not interact with melanophilin or myosin-Va. A closer look at the Rab27a sequence revealed that Trp-73 lies very close to but is not included within the GTPase activity region of Rab27a. The comparison of the molecular structures of Rab27a and Rab3a has shown that the Trp-73 in Rab27a corresponds to the Trp-76 in Rab3a that is responsible for the direct interaction of Rab3a with its effector Rabphilin-3a. This tryptophan residue is very conserved within many Rab proteins (20Ostermeier C. Brunger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Google Scholar), and together with two other amino acids, Phe-59 and Asp-91, forms a hydrophobic triad that seems to generally allow the stabilization of the interaction between the Rab protein and its effector (21Merithew E. Hatherly S. Dumas J.J. Lawe D.C. Heller-Harrison R. Lambright D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13982-13988Google Scholar). It has also been shown that a single missense mutation in the Rab3Aa sequence (V55E), which does not affect the GTP/GDP binding, specifically inhibits the Rab3a interaction with another effector, RIM (22Brondyk W.H. McKiernan C.J. Fortner K.A. Stabila P. Holz R.W. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1137-1143Google Scholar). Taken together, these arguments indicate that the W73G mutation in Rab27a impairs the association of the Rab protein with the melanophilin/myosin-Va complex. When transfected, Rab27a-W73G cannot impair the interaction of the endogenous wild-type Rab27a, expressed in B16 cells, with melanophilin and thereby cannot affect melanosome transport. Nevertheless, the GS patient with homozygous W73G mutation expresses only Rab27a-W73G. Because this mutant does not bind melanophilin, it cannot support peripheral melanosome transport. Because the region containing the residue 152 is not included in any known putative Rab GTP/GDP or effector binding sites, no predictive hypothesis on the molecular behavior of Rab27a-A152P can be proposed. Rab27a-A152P also acted as a dominant interfering mutant, because it hindered melanosomes as well as melanophilin and myosin-Va localization to the dendrite tips. Rab27a-A152P binds GTP and is able to associate with melanophilin and myosin-Va. This mutant showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization that did not overlap with the Tyrp1 labeling, suggesting that Rab27a-A152P is not targeted to melanosome.

This group contains two genes that encode Arg-specific proteases (rgpA and rgpB) and one gene encoding a Lys-specific protease (kgp). Gene ablation studies have shown that RgpA and RgpB are required for the activation of Kgp, placing the Arg-specific proteases at the top of a proteolytic pathway required for bacterial growth (4Veith P.D.

The protein encoded byrgpB is predicted to consist of three distinct segments (see Fig. 1), but only two are found in the mature product isolated from bacterial cultures, the catalytic unit and an Ig domain. Consequently the 205-amino acid N-terminal segment may constitute an activation peptide that restrains the activity of the protease until it reaches its site of action. Structural analysis of the catalytic unit of RgpB (6Eichinger A. Beisel H.G. Jacob U. Huber R. Medrano F.J. Banbula A. Potempa J. Travis J. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5453-5462Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) demonstrates that it shares its evolutionary origin with a common ancestor of caspases, proteases involved in apoptosis and cytokine activation (7Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Moreover, homology mapping suggests that the clan encompassing gingipains and caspases also may contain bacterial clostripain, plant and animal legumains (processing proteases) (8Chen J.M. Rawlings N.D. Stevens R.A. Barrett A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and separase (required for sister chromatid separation during anaphase) (9Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth M. Cell. 2000; 103: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). This clan is known as protease clan CD (10Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the caspase-hemoglobinase fold (11Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Proteins. 2002; 46: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The majority of proteases are synthesized as zymogens that await activation at a suitable time to protect the biosynthetic machinery of the cell against activation and to act as a timing event in biological function (12Neurath H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the key events in any proteolytic pathway is the conversion of the zymogen to the active enzyme. Different protease clans utilize distinct strategies for zymogen maintenance and activation, but within clans there seems to be conservation of a particular strategy. On the basis of conservation of mechanism one would imagine that protease clan CD would embrace a similar activation pathway, meaning that the zymogens of caspases and RgpB should be stabilized by homologous molecular interactions. The molecular determinants of caspase activation have been elucidated (13Renatus M. Stennicke H.R. Scott F.L. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consequently the understanding that the precursor of RgpB (pro-RgpB) may require truncation at its N terminus (or even C terminus) for its activation serves as a good model to test the conservation hypothesis for protease zymogen activation since these observations would seem to contrast with the caspase activation mechanism. This study presents a detailed investigation of the autocatalytic processing of recombinant pro-RgpB, including the characterization of intermediates on the activation pathway, to clarify the mechanism of pro-RgpB maturation. Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain YG227 (Mata,Δalg6::HIS3,ade2–101, his3Δ200,ura3–52, lys2–801) was kindly provided by Markus Aebi (Institute of Microbiology, ETH Zentrum, Zurich).Escherichia coli DH5α was used as the host for construction and propagation of all plasmids. Standard and synthetic media were prepared and supplemented with nutrients appropriate for selection and maintenance of plasmids as described previously (16Johnston J.R. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: A Practical Approach. 141. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 123-134Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in 2% glucose as carbon source and 2% galactose and 1% raffinose to induce protein expression fromGAL1 promoter. The pRS316Gal(ΔAcc65I) expression vector was produced for internal laboratory purposes as follows, although the deletion of Acc65I was not specifically necessary for the cloning strategy used in this report. The pRS316(ΔAcc65I) was first generated by digestion of pRS316 (17Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with Acc65I and blunt ending of the overhang by T4 polymerase and religation in the presence ofAcc65I. Clones lacking the KpnI/Acc65I site were identified by restriction enzyme digest and used to generate the expression vector. The sequence encoding the Gal1promoter was amplified from genomic yeast DNA using primers Gal1f (5-ttggagctcacatggcattaccaccatatacatatc-3) and Gal1r (5-agagcggccgccggtaccgttttttctccttgacgttaaagt-3). This fragment was introduced intro pRS316(ΔAcc65I) as aSacI-NotI insert resulting in pRS316Gal plasmid. The full-length pro form of RgpB was amplified from genomic DNA isolated from P. gingivalis strain HG66. The 24-residue signal peptide of gingipain was replaced by the signal peptide of yeast carboxypeptidase Y amplified from pRA21 plasmid (18Nielsen T.L. Holmberg S. Petersen J.G. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1990; 33: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The insert was then ligated into the yeast expression plasmid pRS316Gal, and insertion of a FLAG epitope sequence (DYKDDDDK) at the C terminus resulted in the pro-RgpB FL1-WT construct (Fig. 1). The XhoI restriction site encoding two amino acids (Leu and Glu) separates the FLAG tag sequence from the authentic C-terminal sequence of pro-RgpB. Specific mutants (Fig.1) were constructed using an overlap polymerase chain reaction technique and the pro-RgpB FL-WT constructs as a template. The double mutant 2The minus sign before the number indicates residues in the RgpB prodomain counting backward using the first residue of the mature protein as the origin. Arg−1→ Ala/Arg−103 → Ala was generated in the same way but with pro-RgpB FL Arg−103 → Ala as a template. All constructs were sequenced completely to confirm that no undesired mutations were present. Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method, and transformants were selected on SC plates without uracil (SC−uracil) for auxotrophic selection (19Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2895) Google Scholar). Large scale expression was performed as follows. Single colony transformants were used to inoculate 20 ml of SC−uracil medium, and cultures were grown at 30 °C for 24 h followed by inoculation to 1.0 liter of medium, and the culture was allowed to grow for 12 more h. Next cells were washed in water and inoculated into induction medium (SC−uracil, 2% galactose, 1% raffinose). Cells were harvested by centrifugation 6 h after induction, washed in water, and resuspended in 20 mmBis-Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.5 containing the protease inhibitors 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonic acid and 100 μm3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (20Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). A half-volume of glass beads was added, and the cells were mechanically broken in a bead beater. Cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min followed by filtration, and the supernatant fluid was used for further purification. Yeast extract was applied to a Sepharose Q (HiTrapQ HP5, Amersham Biosciences) column equilibrated with 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5 and washed with 5 column volumes of the same buffer following which bound protein was eluted with a two-step gradient (0–300 mm NaCl, 20 column volumes; and 300–500 mm NaCl, 5 column volumes). Fractions were assayed for activity, and Western blot analysis was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Sigma). Fractions containing recombinant protein were pooled and further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography by binding to the to M-2 anti-FLAG agarose gel (Sigma) slurry overnight at 4 °C. Next the gel was washed on the column with TBS buffer (20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6). Bound protein was eluted with FLAG-peptide (100 μg/ml). 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for active enzyme or by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibodies. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and store at −70 °C. Identification of the recombinant protein was achieved by using both N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). Zymogen processing was analyzed in two ways. First, purified pro-RgpB was subjected to self-processing by incubating the recombinant protein in assay buffer (200 mmTris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 10 mm cysteine) for 2 h at 37 °C. Part of the reaction mixture was used for affinity labeling and activity assay; the other part of the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μm leupeptin, and cleavage products were analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibodies or antiserum to the mature RgpB (21Potempa J. Pike R. Travis J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 1176-1182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, purified pro-RgpB was tested for self-processing at different concentrations to test for inter-versus intramolecular activation. The RgpB antiserum was raised against a peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 35 residues of mature RgpB and preferentially recognizes denatured protein. It does not require a free N terminus for reactivity as demonstrated under “Results.” All chemicals used in the synthesis of the acyloxymethyl ketone were purchased from Advanced Chemtech and Sigma. The biotinylated inhibitor BiRK was synthesized by a solid-phase method from an arginine chloromethyl ketone according to the procedure described in Ref. 22Lee A. Huang L. Ellman J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9907-9914Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar with minor modifications. The chloromethyl ketone was synthesized essentially as described using Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH where Fmoc is N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl and Pbf is 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl (23Robinson A.J. Pauls H.W. Coles P.J. Smith R.A. Krantz A. Bioorg. Chem. 1992; 20: 42-54Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Following cleavage from the matrix and deprotection, BiRK was purified on a Waters C-18 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography column and verified by mass spectrometry. The association rate of BiRK was determined by titration against RgpB of known activity purified from P. gingivalis (24Potempa J. Mikolajczyk-Pawlinska J. Brassell D. Nelson D. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21648-21657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Enzyme was used at a concentration of 0.25 nm. Enzymatic activity was measured by cleavage of Boc-FPR-AMC as described above. Inhibition of RgpB with BiRK was determined by progress curve analysis as follows. Enzyme was pre-equilibrated in assay buffer for 10 min at 37 °C and then added to a pre-equilibrated reaction mix containing 0–10 nm BiRK and 2 mm Boc-FPR-AMC in assay buffer to a final volume of 100 μl. Kinetic constants were obtained by a nonlinear least-squares fit of the data to the equation:y = (vst − (vs − v 0)(1 − exp−kt)/k obs) −A. The slope of the plot of k obs versus inhibitor concentration was used to determine the second order rate constant ka = 3.5 × 105m−1s−1. Active site labeling was performed with a trace (non-saturated) and a high (saturated) biotinylated affinity probe concentration. The time and concentration required to obtain trace and saturation probe binding were estimated according to the equation t 12 = ln2/ka[I] where I is the concentration of inhibitor required for free enzyme to decrease by 50% (half-lifet 12). A 30-μl portion of purified recombinant proenzyme (126 ng) subjected to autoprocessing was activated in assay buffer for 10 min at 37 °C. BiRK was added to a final concentration of 10 nm for 5 min at room temperature (trace probe condition) and 5 μm for 45 min at room temperature (saturating probe condition). Active site labeling was terminated by adding leupeptin (100 μm final concentration) for 5 min followed by boiling samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Routinely the activity of recombinant forms of gingipain was determined by recording the release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) generated by cleavage of Boc-QGR-AMC (100 μm) at 37 °C by measuring the increase in fluorescence at excitation/emission 380/490 nm using an fmax fluorescence microplate reader (Amersham Biosciences) operating in the kinetic mode. Assays were performed in 100 μl of assay buffer. Specific activity was defined as the amount of AMC released/min/μg of purified recombinant protein used for assay. The catalytic parametersK m and k cat were calculated by a non-linear regression fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using substrate at a concentration ranging from 2.3 to 300 μm. Active enzyme concentration of fully processed recombinant wild-type RgpB was based on active site titration with leupeptin. Because of the low concentration of double Arg−1 → Ala/Arg−103 → Ala pro-RgpB mutant and its relatively poor activity, we were not able to accurately evaluate the enzyme concentration by active site titration. Therefore we estimated the enzyme concentration based on protein concentration determined by a modified Bradford assay (Pierce) with adjustment for the active pro-RgpB using incorporation of BiRK. Heterologous expression of soluble and active full-length or mutant forms of RgpB inE. coli was unsuccessful. Therefore we adapted the constructs to a Saccharomyces expression system that is engineered to drive synthesis and secretion. We added a FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus of all constructs for ease of purification and identification. Recombinant proteins were purified by a two-step protocol using anion exchange (Q-Sepharose) followed by anti-FLAG immunoaffinity chromatography and analyzed initially by Coomassie protein staining (Fig. 2 A) and Western blot using a FLAG antiserum (Fig. 2 B). Yields were low and ranged from 10 to 20 μg of protein/liter of yeast culture. Overexpression of the full-length pro-RgpB resulted predominantly in the expected 82-kDa protein but also in partial processing demonstrated by bands of lower molecular mass (68 and 56 kDa). The N-terminal sequence could not be obtained for this 82-kDa protein, probably due to a blocked N terminus, but based on the molecular mass in SDS-PAGE and assignment of tryptic peptides by MALDI-TOF (80% sequence coverage), the 82-kDa form corresponds to full-length zymogen with signal peptide attached. This was unexpected since the expression system was designed for secretion with expected signal peptide removal. The observation may explain why the recombinant product was not released from the cells, necessitating the extraction of the protein from the cell pellet. N-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the 68-kDa protein began at Ala−104, while the 56-kDa protein began at Tyr1 (see Fig. 1 for a description of the numbering system). Since both of these residues follow Arg in the coding sequence, it is likely that they are generated by a self-processing mechanism. To clarify whether the conversion occurs autocatalytically or whether it is due to a yeast-encoded protease we expressed a catalytic mutant, Cys244 → Ala. Substitution of Ala for the catalytic Cys completely abolished the smaller products, confirming an autoprocessing mechanism (Fig.2, A and B). To assess the importance of autoprocessing we constructed individual Arg → Ala substitutions at the determined cleavage sites and a double mutant containing both substitutions. Both pro-RgpB Arg−103 → Ala and the double mutant were found to be unprocessed, whereas an intermediate 68-kDa form corresponding to pro-RgpB processed at Arg−103 was detected in the Arg−1 → Ala mutant (Fig. 2 B). This indicates that pro-RgpB undergoes sequential two-step processing in which cleavage at Arg−103 is required for subsequent processing at Arg−1. Native mature RgpB obtained from P. gingivalis is truncated at the C terminus (6Eichinger A. Beisel H.G. Jacob U. Huber R. Medrano F.J. Banbula A. Potempa J. Travis J. Bode W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5453-5462Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and consequently we were unable to purify this protein because the C-terminal FLAG tag would be removed. To obtain this derivative we generated the construct pro-RgpB-ΔC-WT that encodes the pro form lacking the 72-residue C-terminal sequence (Fig.1) Expression and purification of this protein gave a band pattern similar to that of a full-length protein, but as expected, each derivative was slightly smaller (Fig. 2 B). Recombinant pro-RgpB proteins were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in assay buffer (see “Materials and Methods”) to provide conditions for autolytic processing. After this time the full-length wild-type proenzyme was almost completely converted to the mature form (Fig.3, A and B). The fully mature recombinant enzyme appeared to be identical in mass to that of the native enzyme indicating cleavage at the same site. The possibility that a contaminating yeast proteinase was responsible for processing is unlikely because the general serine protease inhibitors phenylmethanesulfonic acid (2.5 mm) and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (0.1 mm), the metalloprotease inhibitor 1,10-phenanthroline (1.0 mm), and the aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin (0.015 mm) had no effect on the self-processing (not shown). In contrast, the gingipain inhibitor leupeptin at 100 μm completely prevented proenzyme autoprocessing. Moreover, the catalytic mutant Cys244 → Ala incubated in the same conditions remained unprocessed (Fig.4 A). The double mutant (Arg−1 → Ala/Arg−103 → Ala) subjected to self-processing did not generate any bands recognized by antisera (Fig. 5, A andB). However, affinity labeling revealed additional bands that resulted from an aberrant cleavage (Fig. 5, C andD). The aberrant product did not accumulate during self-processing conditions, and we did not observe an increase in activity as determined by cleavage of Boc-QGR-AMC (Fig.6) or affinity labeling (Fig. 5,C and D).Figure 4Self-processing of pro-RgpB mutants.Pro-RgpB mutants were subjected to self-processing conditions and analyzed by Western blot using anti-FLAG and anti-N-terminal RgpB antiserum.

An intermediate with the N-terminal propeptide intact but lacking the C-terminal FLAG was not detected. This reveals that removal of the C-terminal region (residues 434–506) requires prior removal of the N-terminal pro segment. Surprisingly, conversion to the mature form was drastically retarded in the RgpB-ΔC-WT mutant zymogen exposed to autoprocessing conditions, indicating the importance of the C-terminal part of the protein in maturation (Fig.4 B). The RgpB-ΔC-WT must be relatively inactive because it does not autoprocess in vitro, although conditions in yeast must have been more favorable to produce the initial cleavage events. Our data demonstrate that mature gingipain can be formed in vitro by sequential autoprocessing with the ultimate product lacking both the N-terminal propeptide and the C-terminal extension exactly as seen in the active enzyme isolated from P. gingivalis. However, it is not clear whether the final product represents the most active species or what the relative activities of the zymogen and intermediate forms are. To address this issue and to test the relevance of the cleavages we used active site labeling of recombinant zymogen and its derivatives. This technique relies on the inherent ability of a single active site-directed affinity probe to react with kinetics that parallel the enzyme catalytic competence (25Yamin T.-T. Ayala J.M. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13273-13282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). All intermediates in the processing of pro-RgpB have a potential active site and an intact catalytic apparatus as demonstrated by BiRK labeling (Fig. 3, C and D), but this does not mean that they have equivalent activities. If two species of an enzyme with different activities are present in an equimolar amount, they will be equally labeled only if inhibitor is in excess. Conversely, if the inhibitor is in deficit (enzyme is saturating) the relative labeling should reflect the activity of the forms: the most active form will be more heavily labeled. In other words, low BiRK concentrations reflect enzymatic activity, whereas high BiRK concentrations simply reflect total concentration. This useful property enables us to quantitate enzyme activity as a function of BiRK labeling. The probe we designed, BiRK, was intended for high reactivity with Arg-specific cysteine proteases but was broadly tolerant of extended subsite occupancy. Labeling was performed using a low probe concentration (10 nm) and short time of incubation (5 min) under conditions predetermined (see “Materials and Methods”) not to saturate the potential active sites present (Fig. 3 C). To verify this procedure we also incubated the intermediates with probe under conditions calculated to completely saturate all available active sites (5 μm, 45 min) (Fig. 3 D). The intensity of the bands labeled at high probe concentration was comparable to the intensity of bands probed with antibodies, reflecting the total protein of each form (Fig. 3, B and D, comparelanes 1). In stark contrast, low probe concentrations revealed a completely different pattern with the fully processed enzyme, even though it is present in the lowest amount, displaying highest labeling (Fig. 3, B and C, comparelanes 1). Full-length zymogen, representing the highest concentration among the proteins, showed the lowest labeling under low probe conditions. These findings indicate that the enzyme gains activity with each of the three processing events. The same samples were also analyzed for enzymatic activity. When incubating with the fluorometric substrate Boc-QGR-AMC a 3-fold increase in substrate cleavage was detected in wild-type digest, and no increase in activity was observed for C-terminally truncated enzyme and double mutant (Fig. 6). Taken together, the data argue that pro-RgpB activation correlates with the enzyme processing and is accomplished by sequential cleavage of N-terminal propeptide followed by trimming of the C terminus. Zymogen processing could be either intramolecular (by the catalytic site within the precursor) or intermolecular (where a different catalytic site attacks the bonds in an adjacent molecule). These possibilities can be distinguished by determining whether the process is unimolecular or bimolecular (26Nagase H. Enghild J. Suzuki K. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5783-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The rate of autoprocessing was dependent on precursor concentration (Fig. 7), implying a second order process. Since this is consistent with a bimolecular mechanism, we conclude that processing is predominantly intermolecular, although we cannot rule out some intramolecular component. Probe labeling is consistent with an increase in activity during processing, and we attempted to confirm this by determining the kinetic parameters of full-length wild-type protein converted to the mature form by self-processing and full-length double mutant (Arg−1 → Ala/Arg−103 → Ala), which represents the zymogen form. Labeling with BiRK revealed the full-length zymogen and an aberrant product of about 45 kDa (Fig. 5, C and D). The latter probably corresponds to a cleavage C-terminal to Arg−1 since it is not recognized by the specific anti-RgpB antiserum raised to the first 35 residues of mature RgpB. The aberrant cleavage appears to be a result of mutating Arg−103 and Arg−1 and must be taken into account for quantitating activity due to the full-length zymogen. Quantitative image analysis revealed that the full-length zymogen corresponds to 66% of the total RgpB as determined under saturating BiRK conditions (Fi"

During the course of biogenesis some proteins must traverse a membrane. The cytoplasmic (inner or plasma) membrane of prokaryotic cells and the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of eukaryotic cells are equipped with conserved protein complexes called the SecYE complex, Sec61 complex, translocase, or translocon. These complexes are thought to serve as a pathway (channel) for protein translocation. TheEscherichia coli SecYEG complex, one of the most intensively characterized translocon components (1Mori H. Ito K. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 494-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), functions in conjunction with the SecA ATPase to drive protein movement through the prokaryotic cytoplasmic membrane (2Economou A. Wickner W. Cell. 1994; 78: 835-843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). SecY and SecE are integral membrane proteins with 10 and 3 transmembrane segments, respectively, and they are sufficient to reconstitute basic SecA-dependent preprotein translocation activity (3Akimaru J.

Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic images suggest that the SecYEG complex indeed forms a ringlike structure with a hole at the center. It has been estimated that 2–4 units of the SecYE(G) complex constitute a channel. However, the exact subunit structure of the translocation channel has not been elucidated. A biochemical study of a SecYEG complex that bears a preprotein translocation intermediate suggests that an active translocase complex contains only one SecYEG heterotrimer (8Yahr T.L. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another study used an electrophoretic approach to show that an active translocation channel contains two SecYEG heterotrimers (9Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dimeric SecYEG has also been observed in the first three-dimensional image obtained for a translocon (7Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of the SecYEG complex is an important unsolved question.Spectrofluorometry provides a useful means to study the dynamic nature of proteins, including those integrated into membranes (10Heuck A.P.

Our experience indicates that the E. coli SecYE(G) complex is not ideal for physicochemical characterization because of its instability, insolubility, and other characteristics of intractability. As an alternative model organism for the study of protein translocase, we became interested in Thermus thermophilus HB8 (11Yokoyama S. Hirota H. Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Ito Y.

In this article we report on the initial characterization of the T. thermophilus SecYE complex (TSecYE) with special reference to its quaternary structure as studied by FRET approaches. We show that TSecYE forms a constitutive oligomer in the membrane.DISCUSSIONThe protein-translocating channel is a fundamental cellular element that enables a considerable fraction of gene products to achieve their subcellular localization. Thermophilic organisms provide us with excellent opportunities to study the structure-function relationships of proteins because of the additional stability of their protein products. However, not many membrane proteins have been characterized from thermophiles. In this work, we clonedsecY and secE genes from T. thermophilus and established a system to overexpress, purify, and reconstitute the recombinant proteins TSecY and TSecE from E. coli. TSecYE expressed in E. coli as a membrane-integrated protein complex exhibited the in vitroactivity to mediate translocation of the E. coli proOmpA protein into inverted membrane vesicles (data not shown). In a detergent C12E8 solution, TSecY and TSecE form a complex, TSecYE, that exists as a monomeric heterodimer. TSecYE is sufficiently stable such that it can be purified to homogeneity after a series of column chromatographies, and it can be reconstituted withE. coli phospholipids into translocation-active proteoliposomes. This activity is dependent on TSecA and ATP, and its optimal temperature is 50–60 °C. Although this is lower than the optimal growth temperature of T. thermophilus, such a behavior is not unexpected, because the liposome vesicles were composed of E. coli phospholipids, which might be unstable at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the reconstituted proteoliposomes were active at 37 °C, well below the minimum growth temperature ofT. thermophilus HB8 (∼60 °C). Our attempts thus far have failed to reconstitute active translocase with T. thermophilus phospholipids.Despite the use of heterologous phospholipids, the reconstituted TSecYE proteoliposomes exhibited absolute specificity to the cognate SecA protein from the same organism. The intrinsic ATPase activity of TSecA is extremely low (Fig.3D). 6N. Yamamoto, unpublished results. The ATPase activity of TSecA is dramatically stimulated by membrane vesicles with overproduced TSecYE. However, the addition of E. coliproOmpA only moderately stimulated the TSecA ATPase activity. The genomic sequence of T. thermophilus HB8 does not reveal an OmpA homologue in this organism, 7R. Masui, unpublished information.suggesting that this preprotein from E. coli is not an ideal substrate for the TSecA-TSecYE translocase. Our results showing that only SecYE and SecA from the same organism can function as an active translocase reinforces the notion that specific SecYE-SecA interaction is crucial for the protein translocase activity. Although the cytoplasmic regions of SecY are well conserved between T. thermophilus and E. coli (Fig. 1), both SecYE and SecA could have specific determinants for the productive interaction. The T. thermophilus-E. coli translocase combination may prove useful for the study of specific interaction between the SecA motor and the SecYE channel components.Our results show that TSecYE exists as a monomer of the heterodimer when in detergent-solubilized state. This “monomer” was the unit of the modification with the fluorophore-bearing iodoacetamide derivatives, and the FRET observed in our reconstitution experiments represents a further association of this unit of the SecYE complex. Thus, our FRET results have shown that at least two TSecYE heterodimers form a stable complex in reconstituted proteoliposomes that are active in supporting SecA-dependent preprotein translocation. These results are not consistent with the conclusion that only a single SecYE heterodimer is sufficient to promote preprotein translocation on the basis of biochemical studies of an E. coli SecYE complex bearing a translocation intermediate (8Yahr T.L. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Recent electron microscopic studies of B. subtilis orE. coli SecYE(G) complex suggest that 2–4 SecYE(G) complexes form a ring-shaped structure with a central “channel” of 15–50 Å (4Mayer T.H.

Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the exact quaternary structure of the SecYEG channel has not been determined. Manting et al. (5Manting E.H. van der Does C. Remigy H. Engel A. Driessen A.J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) proposed a SecA-dependent formation of a tetrameric SecYEG complex. More recently, Breyton et al. (7Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) revealed a dimeric super-assembly of E. coli SecYEG by analysis of two-dimensional crystals. We have now shown that TSecYE constitutively forms an oligomer in functional proteoliposomes. Our FRET approach complements the knowledge obtained by direct structural determination, because it allows us to examine membrane-integrated and functional SecYE complexes. It should be stressed, however, that our conclusion does not mean that the translocation channel is static. Instead, it presumably undergoes structural changes in response to SecA and preprotein, probably accompanied by the opening/closing movements of a gating device. More quantitative FRET analysis may prove useful as a means to follow the dynamic nature of the SecYE translocation channel during the initiation, continuation, and termination events of the SecA-dependent translocation reaction. During the course of biogenesis some proteins must traverse a membrane.

SecY and SecE are integral membrane proteins with 10 and 3 transmembrane segments, respectively, and they are sufficient to reconstitute basic SecA-dependent preprotein translocation activity (3Akimaru J. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Mizushima S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6545-6549Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Structural biology studies of the Sec translocase have begun to yield some useful information (4Mayer T.H. Menetret J.-F. Breitling R. Miller K.R. Akey C.W. Rapoport T.A. J. Mol.

Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Electron microscopic images suggest that the SecYEG complex indeed forms a ringlike structure with a hole at the center. It has been estimated that 2–4 units of the SecYE(G) complex constitute a channel. However, the exact subunit structure of the translocation channel has not been elucidated. A biochemical study of a SecYEG complex that bears a preprotein translocation intermediate suggests that an active translocase complex contains only one SecYEG heterotrimer (8Yahr T.L. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Another study used an electrophoretic approach to show that an active translocation channel contains two SecYEG heterotrimers (9Bessonneau P. Besson V. Collinson I. Duong F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Dimeric SecYEG has also been observed in the first three-dimensional image obtained for a translocon (7Breyton C. Haase W. Rapoport T.A. Kühlbrandt W. Collinson I. Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The quaternary structure of the SecYEG complex is an important unsolved question. Spectrofluorometry provides a useful means to study the dynamic nature of proteins, including those integrated into membranes (10Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Our experience indicates that the E. coli SecYE(G) complex is not ideal for physicochemical characterization because of its instability, insolubility, and other characteristics of intractability. As an alternative model organism for the study of protein translocase, we became interested in Thermus thermophilus HB8 (11Yokoyama S. Hirota H. Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Ito Y.

Thermophilic organisms provide us with excellent opportunities to study the structure-function relationships of proteins because of the additional stability of their protein products. However, not many membrane proteins have been characterized from thermophiles. In this work, we clonedsecY and secE genes from T. thermophilus and established a system to overexpress, purify, and reconstitute the recombinant proteins TSecY and TSecE from E. coli. TSecYE expressed in E. coli as a membrane-integrated protein complex exhibited the in vitroactivity to mediate translocation of the E. coli proOmpA protein into inverted membrane vesicles (data not shown). In a detergent C12E8 solution, TSecY and TSecE form a complex, TSecYE, that exists as a monomeric heterodimer. TSecYE is sufficiently stable such that it can be purified to homogeneity after a series of column chromatographies, and it can be reconstituted withE. coli phospholipids into translocation-active proteoliposomes. This activity is dependent on TSecA and ATP, and its optimal temperature is 50–60 °C. Although this is lower than the optimal growth temperature of T. thermophilus, such a behavior is not unexpected, because the liposome vesicles were composed of E. coli phospholipids, which might be unstable at higher temperatures. On the other hand, the reconstituted proteoliposomes were active at 37 °C, well below the minimum growth temperature ofT. thermophilus HB8 (∼60 °C). Our attempts thus far have failed to reconstitute active translocase with T. thermophilus phospholipids.Despite the use of heterologous phospholipids, the reconstituted TSecYE proteoliposomes exhibited absolute specificity to the cognate SecA protein from the same organism. The intrinsic ATPase activity of TSecA is extremely low (Fig.3D). 6N. Yamamoto, unpublished results. The ATPase activity of TSecA is dramatically stimulated by membrane vesicles with overproduced TSecYE. However, the addition of E. coliproOmpA only moderately stimulated the TSecA ATPase activity. The genomic sequence of T. thermophilus HB8 does not reveal an OmpA homologue in this organism, 7R. Masui, unpublished information.suggesting that this preprotein from E. coli is not an ideal substrate for the TSecA-TSecYE translocase. Our results showing that only SecYE and SecA from the same organism can function as an active translocase reinforces the notion that specific SecYE-SecA interaction is crucial for the protein translocase activity. Although the cytoplasmic regions of SecY are well conserved between T. thermophilus and E. coli (Fig. 1), both SecYE and SecA could have specific determinants for the productive interaction. The T. thermophilus-E. coli translocase combination may prove useful for the study of specific interaction between the SecA motor and the SecYE channel components.Our results show that TSecYE exists as a monomer of the heterodimer when in detergent-solubilized state. This “monomer” was the unit of the modification with the fluorophore-bearing iodoacetamide derivatives, and the FRET observed in our reconstitution experiments represents a further association of this unit of the SecYE complex. Thus, our FRET results have shown that at least two TSecYE heterodimers form a stable complex in reconstituted proteoliposomes that are active in supporting SecA-dependent preprotein translocation. These results are not consistent with the conclusion that only a single SecYE heterodimer is sufficient to promote preprotein translocation on the basis of biochemical studies of an E. coli SecYE complex bearing a translocation intermediate (8Yahr T.L. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4393-4401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Recent electron microscopic studies of B. subtilis orE. coli SecYE(G) complex suggest that 2–4 SecYE(G) complexes form a ring-shaped structure with a central “channel” of 15–50 Å (4Mayer T.H.

Nature. 2002; 418: 662-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) revealed a dimeric super-assembly of E. coli SecYEG by analysis of two-dimensional crystals. We have now shown that TSecYE constitutively forms an oligomer in functional proteoliposomes. Our FRET approach complements the knowledge obtained by direct structural determination, because it allows us to examine membrane-integrated and functional SecYE complexes. It should be stressed, however, that our conclusion does not mean that the translocation channel is static. Instead, it presumably undergoes structural changes in response to SecA and preprotein, probably accompanied by the opening/closing movements of a gating device. More quantitative FRET analysis may prove useful as a means to follow the dynamic nature of the SecYE translocation channel during the initiation, continuation, and termination events of the SecA-dependent translocation reaction.

In a previous study (North, S., El-Ghissassi, F., Pluquet, O., Verhaegh, G., and Hainaut, P. (2000) Oncogene 19, 1206–1214), we have shown that WR1065 activates wild-type p53 in cultured cells. Here we show that WR1065 induces p53 to accumulate through escape from proteasome-dependent degradation. This accumulation is not prevented by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases and is not accompanied by phosphorylation of Ser-15, -20, or -37, which are common targets of the kinases activated in response to DNA damage. Furthermore, WR1065 activates the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), decreases complex formation between p53 and inactive JNK, and phosphorylates p53 at Thr-81, a known site of phosphorylation by JNK. A dominant negative form of JNK (JNK-APF) reduces by 507 the activation of p53 by WR1065. Thus, WR1065 activates p53 through a JNK-dependent signaling pathway. This pathway may prove useful for pharmacological modulation of p53 activity through non-genotoxic mechanisms.

In addition, WR1065 stimulates the proliferation of bone marrow progenitors in vitro, inhibits DNA topoisomerase II α (16Murley J.S. Constantinou A. Kamath N.S. Grdina D.J.

In MCF-7 cells (expressing wild-type p53), WR1065 induces a p53-dependent increase in the level of p21waf-1, correlated with an arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (22North S. El Ghissassi F. Pluquet O. Verhaegh G. Hainaut P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1206-1214Google Scholar). p53 acts as a transcription regulator to arrest proliferation or to induce cell death in response to multiple types of stresses (23Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Google Scholar). Broadly, these stresses can be classified in three groups, including genotoxic stress (e.g. DNA strand breaks, base oxidation, and formation of bulky DNA adducts), oncogenic stress (constitutive activation of Ras/E2F or ॆ-catenin/c-myc pathways, acting through p14arf), and non-genotoxic stress (ribonucleotide depletion and hypoxia) (21North S.

Target genes of p53 include, among others, regulators of cell cycle progression in G1 and G2 (p21waf-1 and14-3-3ς), activators of apoptosis (Bax-1,Aip-1, APO-1/Fas, and Apaf-1), and genes involved in redox metabolism (PIG-3, COX-2, andNOS-2) (see review in Refs. 21North S.

In non-stressed cells, p53 is in a latent form and is constitutively repressed by the binding of two proteins, Mdm2 and the inactive form of JNK,1 which mediate the degradation of p53 by the proteasome (28Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Wu X. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2543-2547Google Scholar, 29Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z.

Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Google Scholar). In response to stress, p53 undergoes multiple post-translational modifications, both in the N- and C-terminal regions. These modifications stabilize the protein and turn it from a latent to an active form that can bind specific DNA sequences with a high affinity. These post-translational modifications (reviewed in Refs. 24Pluquet O. Hainaut P. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 1-15Google Scholar, 26Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Curr. Opin.

Phosphorylation at specific sites may play additional roles in the control of p53 activities, such as phosphorylation of Ser-46, which appears to correlate with p53-dependent apoptosis (36Bulavin D.V.

Members of the PI 3-kinase family and of the Chk family phosphorylate p53 at several sites in the N terminus, in particular Ser-15 and Ser-20 (37Shieh S.Y. Ahn J. Tamai K. Taya Y. Prives C.

Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Google Scholar). These serines are located within the domain of interaction with Mdm2, and their phosphorylations allow p53 to escape Mdm2-mediated degradation (50Prives C. Hall P.A. J. Pathol. 1999; 187: 112-126Google Scholar). Escape from degradation can also occur through the binding of Mdm2 by p14arf, the alternative product of the CDKN2a locus (24Pluquet O. Hainaut P. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 1-15Google Scholar, 25Balint E.E. Vousden K.H. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1813-1823Google Scholar). In contrast, JNK acts through an Mdm2-independent mechanism to regulate p53 stability. Binding of the inactive kinase to residues 97–116 earmarks p53 for proteasome degradation (29Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T. Yin Z. Wu X. Jones S.N. Ronai Z. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2658-2663Google Scholar). After kinase activation, this complex dissociates, and active JNK may further participate in p53 induction by phosphorylation of Thr-81 (51Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Google Scholar). The same dual role of JNK in the regulation of the stability and activity of transcription factors has also been demonstrated with c-Jun, Elk-1, and ATF-2 (52Fuchs S.Y. Dolan L. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1531-1535Google Scholar, 53Fuchs S.Y. Xie B. Adler V. Fried V.A. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32163-32168Google Scholar). Activation of JNK is induced by many forms of genotoxic and well non-genotoxic stress such as heat shock, osmotic shock, and anti-oxidative agents (47Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). There is evidence that p53 may play a role in the mechanism of cytoprotection by WR1065. For example, in a recent study, Shen et al. (54Shen H. Chen Z.J. Zilfou J.T. Hopper E. Murphy M. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1067-1073Google Scholar) have shown that WR1065 protects murine embryo fibroblasts from paclitaxel-induced cell death in a p53-dependent manner. It is therefore essential to determine the molecular mechanisms by which WR1065 activates p53. In this study, we show that induction of p53 by WR1065 is not mediated through post-translational modifications that commonly occur in response to DNA damage, such as phosphorylation of Ser-15, -20, and -37. In contrast, this induction involves phosphorylation at Thr-81, the site of active JNK phosphorylation. Moreover, induction of p53 by WR1065 requires dissociation of complexes with inactive JNK and is at least partially prevented by a dominant negative JNK mutant. These results indicate that WR1065 induces p53 by a stress signaling pathway that differs from the one activated by most DNA-damaging agents. The breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (expressing wild-type functional p53) and MN1 and MDD2 cells (55Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. Oren M. Chin D.M. Lyass L. Zelnick C.R. Kazarov A. Toyofuku W. Gray-Bablin J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2375-2385Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 107 fetal calf serum (PAA, Linz, Austria), 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics, 107 CO2, MN1 and MDD2 were selected in 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). MCF-7 cells were transfected using Lipofection (FuGENETM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). MCF-7 cells were stably transfected with a dominant negative JNK (JNK-APF) bearing the FLAG epitope (pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK[T183A/Y185F]) or the empty vector (58Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar). Cells were selected in 0.4 mg/ml G418. Cells were treated with different drugs at 50–657 confluency. WR2721 and WR1065 were provided by US Bioscience Inc. (West Conshohocken, PA), dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and flushed with argon to prevent oxidation. Aminoguanidine (Sigma) was dissolved in culture medium and added to cells 10 min before WR1065. LY294002 (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 10 ॖm. Cells were pretreated with LY294002 for 1 h before exposure to aminoguanidine and WR1065. Hydrogen peroxide and cycloheximide (all from Sigma) were dissolved in deionized water. Lactacystin (Calbiochem) and the fluoropeptide Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem Biochemica, Heidelberg, Germany) were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. Cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates in 100 ॖl at a density of 1·104 cells/well. After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates were incubated at 37 °C with 107 CO2 for 24 h prior to addition of experimental drugs. After 24 h, a plate of each cell line was fixed in situ with trichloroacetic acid and sulforhodamine B staining, as described elsewhere (59Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Google Scholar), to provide a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of drug addition (Tz). Cells were preincubated with aminoguanidine 10 min prior to addition of WR1065. After addition of WR1065, cells were further incubated for an additional 30 min. Then H2O2 was added at 100 and 200 ॖm(final concentration), and the plates were incubated for an additional 24 h. Control cultures without any additive or with only WR1065 were run in parallel. The assay was terminated by the addition of cold trichloroacetic acid; sulforhodamine B staining was performed, and absorbance was measured at 530 nm. Cell growth was evaluated at each H2O2 concentration by using Equation 1, (Ti−Tz)/(C−Tz)×100Equation 1 where Ti represents the absorbance of the treated cells and C the absorbance of the untreated (control) cells (59Skehan P.

Nuclei of treated cells were collected and stained with propidium iodate, using the cycle TEST-PLUS DNA-staining kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). The DNA content of the stained nuclei was measured on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and results were analyzed using the CellQuest and ModFit LT2.0 softwares (BD Biosciences). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected by scraping. Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (61Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5699-5706Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in 100 ॖl (per million cells) of buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 207 glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.17 Nonidet P-40), containing protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 2 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 0.7 ॖg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 50 ॖm sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation at 300 × g for 4 min, the supernatant was designated 舠cytoplasmic fraction舡 and stored at −80 °C. The pellets were further lysed for 30 min on ice in 50 ॖl (per million cells) of buffer B (same as buffer A, with 0.5 m instead of 10 mm NaCl) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 ×g and 4 °C. The supernatant was designated 舠nuclear fraction舡 and stored at −80 °C. Total protein extracts were performed in buffer B, supplemented as described above. Equal amounts of proteins (quantified by Bradford assay) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, resolved on 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins were revealed by using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (ECL or ECL+, Amersham Biosciences). For p53 detection, antibodies DO-7 (1:1000, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-phospho-Ser-15, -20, and -37 (all at 1:1000, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), CM-1 (1:1000, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), and anti-phospho-Thr-81 (1:100) (51Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Google Scholar) were used. Although the reactivity of the anti-phospho-Thr-81 antibody is weak, its specificity has been fully characterized in a previous publication (51Buschmann T. Potapova O. Bar-Shira A. Ivanov V.N. Fuchs S.Y. Henderson S. Fried V.A. Minamoto T. Alarcon-Vargas D. Pincus M.R. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Shiloh Y. Ronai Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2743-2754Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-Ser-73 c-Jun (1:1000) and c-Jun (1:1000) antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Anti-actin monoclonal antibody (C-2, 250 ng/ml) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Mdm2 monoclonal antibody (IF2, 1:1000), anti-JNK (clone 666, 1:1000), and anti-phospho-JNK (1:1000) were obtained from Calbiochem, Pharmingen, and Cell Signaling, respectively. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (250 ng/ml, Pierce) was used as secondary antibodies. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 mg of whole cell extracts. Pre-clearing was performed with 50 ॖl of IgG (whole molecule)-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C to remove unspecific binding. Precleared extracts were mixed with 1 ॖg of either anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma), JNK monoclonal antibody (clone 666, Pharmingen), or pAb 421 (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at 4 °C. IgG-agarose beads were added for 1 h at 4 °C, and the mixture was centrifuged at 2500 rpm at 4 °C. Agarose beads were washed three times, and pelleted beads were boiled in Laemmli Buffer, loaded on a 107 SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot. The SAPK/JNK activity was measured with a non-radioactive kit from Cell Signaling, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, proteins lysates were incubated with the GST-c-Jun fusion protein beads and washed to remove non-specifically bound proteins. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of cold ATP. c-Jun phosphorylations were measured by Western blot using phospho-63 and phospho-73-c-Jun antibodies (Cell Signaling) and chemiluminescent detection system. Densitometric quantification of the signals was performed. The double-stranded p53 consensus binding sequence p53con(5′-GGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCC-3′) was end-labeled with ∼3000 Ci/mmol [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) as described (61Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5699-5706Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (0.5 ng), sonicated herring sperm DNA (2 ॖg; Promega, Madison, WI), bovine serum albumin (5 ॖg), DTT (4 mm), and nuclear protein extracts (10 ॖg). Reactions were adjusted to a final volume of 30 ॖl with buffer A. All reactions were carried out in the presence of the monoclonal antibody pAb 421 (100 ng/reaction). This antibody stabilizes p53-DNA complexes and is required to detect stable binding of p53 to short oligonucleotides in cellular extracts. No band was detected in the absence of pAb 421 (61Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5699-5706Google Scholar). Binding reactions were incubated for 30 min at 20 °C. A 15-ॖl aliquot of each reaction was loaded onto a 47 non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and run in TBE buffer at 120 V for 2–3 h. Gels were fixed, dried, and exposed to Kodak x-ray films at −80 °C for 12–48 h. The specificity of the binding was controlled by competition experiments using cold oligonucleotides and using mutant DNA consensus sequence (61Verhaegh G.W. Richard M.J. Hainaut P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5699-5706Google Scholar). Proteasome activity was evaluated as described (62Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15504-15509Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in PBS after treatment, and protein extracts were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 20 mmKCl, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.5 mm DTT. Then 50 ॖm Suc-LLVY-AMC (dissolved in 107 Me2SO) was incubated with 100 ॖg of protein extract in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmATP in a total volume of 200 ॖl. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 200 ॖl of a solution containing 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 9.0), in ethanol/water (144:16). Degradation of the fluoropeptide Suc-VVLY-AMC was assayed by fluorescence (Fluoroskan) at 390 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission. Total RNA was extracted from treated and control MCF-7 cells using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 4 ॖg of RNA were used for reverse transcription. The cDNA corresponding to the TP53 gene was co-amplified with a cDNA from theॆ-actin gene. The annealing temperature of co-amplification was 56 °C (25 cycles). Co-amplified PCR products were analyzed on a 27 agarose gel with ethidium bromide. Fluorescence was quantified using a FluorSMax apparatus (Bio-Rad). The primers used are as follows: ॆ-actin, 5′-GTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCACCA-3′/5′-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′;TP53, 5′-AACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACG-3′/5′-TTCCTCTGTGCGCCGGTCTC-3′. For autoradiograms, densitometric quantification was performed using a Bio-Rad imaging densitometer GS-670 and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). The significance of observed differences was evaluated using the two-tailed Student'st test. Probabilities of p < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. We have shown previously (22North S. El Ghissassi F. Pluquet O. Verhaegh G. Hainaut P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1206-1214Google Scholar) that WR1065 induced the accumulation and activation of wild-type p53 in cultured cells. Fig. 1shows that WR1065 induced a rapid (detectable after 15 min, Fig.1A) and long lasting (over 60 h, Fig. 1C) accumulation of wild-type p53 in MCF-7 cells, which correlated with enhanced DNA binding activity. As WR1065 is rapidly degraded by copper-dependent amine oxidases in culture medium to form toxic metabolites, all experiments were performed in the presence of aminoguanidine (AG) at 4 mm, a concentration shown previously to inhibit copper-dependent amine oxidases (22North S. El Ghissassi F. Pluquet O. Verhaegh G. Hainaut P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1206-1214Google Scholar,63Meier T. Issels R.D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 489-496Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that AG alone did not affect p53 levels (Western blot, A and C) and activity (DNA binding activity, B and C). Similar results were obtained in other cell lines expressing wild-type p53, including HCT116, A549, and MRC-5 (data not shown). Fig. 1C compares the pattern of p53 accumulation by WR1065 and by hydrogen peroxide, an inducer of DNA strand breaks. These patterns were strikingly different, with a sharp peak of p53 activation (4 h) followed by a return to basal level 8 h after treatment with hydrogen peroxide and a long, stable p53 response after treatment with WR1065. The increase in p53 levels after WR1065 treatment was not due to an increase in mRNA levels, as shown by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1D). Overall, these results suggest that WR1065 induced p53 stabilization by a process that differs from the one activated by hydrogen peroxide. In a previous study (22North S. El Ghissassi F. Pluquet O. Verhaegh G. Hainaut P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1206-1214Google Scholar), we have shown that WR1065 protects cells against the cytotoxic effects of H2O2 at concentrations sufficient to induce p53 accumulation. We then evaluated whether p53 could modulate the radioprotective effect of WR1065 in non-transformed murine fibroblasts deficient or proficient for p53. Cells were irradiated at 15 gray in the presence or absence of WR1065 (1 mm + AG), and cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig.2A). Cells with functional wild-type p53 (3T3) were less sensitive to γ-irradiation than those with disrupted p53 (10.1), as detected by a reduced sub-G1peak, corresponding to apoptotic cells. In the presence of WR1065, cell death induced by irradiation was strongly reduced in 3T3 cells (from 18 to 47) but not in 10.1 cells (from 43 to 377). Furthermore, WR1065 had a marked effect in G1 phase distribution in irradiated 3T3 cells, which is increased in comparison to irradiated 3T3 cells without WR1065. This effect was not observed in 10.1 cells. These results clearly demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, WR1065 exerts a radioprotective effect mediated through p53. To determine whether WR1065 can modulate cell proliferation in a p53-dependent manner after exposure to H2O2, we compared the effects of WR1065 in two isogenic cell lines derived from MCF-7, MN1 (p53 competent), and MDD2 (p53 defective) cells. Fig. 2B shows that, in both cell lines, H2O2 had a strong inhibitory effect in cell growth rate. However, in the presence of WR1065, this effect was reduced in MN1 but not in MDD2 cells, indicating a protective effect in the p53-proficient cell line. This observation is compatible with our effect reported previously (22North S. El Ghissassi F. Pluquet O. Verhaegh G. Hainaut P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1206-1214Google Scholar) of WR1065 on cell cycle arrest in these cells. Overall, these results clearly show that p53 play a role in the cytoprotective effects of WR1065 in vitro. The accumulation of p53 after stress results essentially from stabilization of the protein due to the escape from proteasome degradation targeted by Mdm2 and/or JNK. To determine whether the increase in p53 levels induced by WR1065 was due to protein stabilization, we evaluated the protein half-life in cells exposed t"

Ara-C and the standard cytosine DNA base differ by the presence of a 2′-hydroxyl on the arabinose ring of the drug (Fig.1). Ara-C is thought to inhibit DNA polymerases central to replication and repair processes, and thus to slow the growth of malignant cells (16Collins A.R.S. Biochim. Biophys.

The detailed impact of Ara-C on human cells, however, is poorly understood. Incorporation of Ara-C into DNA causes localized alterations in the DNA duplex, including changes in sugar pucker, base stacking, and backbone torsion angles (17Schweitzer B.I. Mikita T. Kellogg G.W. Gardner K.H. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11460-11475Google Scholar, 18Gao Y.-G. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Wang A.H.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9922-9931Google Scholar). Biochemical studies using human topoisomerase I have revealed that Ara-C incorporation at the +1 position of the intact (non-scissile) strand adjacent to the site of single-strand DNA cleavage induces a 4–6-fold increase in covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complexes caused by a 2–3-fold decrease in the rate of religation by the enzyme (12Pourquier P.

Core subdomains I and II form the 舠CAP舡 of human topoisomerase I that contacts one side of the DNA, while core subdomain III, the 舠CAT,舡 and the C-terminal domain contact the opposite side of the DNA. The CAP and CAT regions of the enzyme together wrap completely around the DNA duplex and position the active site residues within hydrogen bonding distance of the scissile DNA phosphate group. Four of five active site residues, Arg-488, Lys-532, Arg-590, and His-632, are located in core subdomain III, while the catalytic Tyr-723 resides in the C-terminal domain (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R.

Stewart L. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 685-696Google Scholar).Structures of covalent human topoisomerase I-DNA complexes containing an intact 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage have also been reported (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K.

Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). In these trapped covalent protein-DNA complexes, the scissile phosphate contained a bridging phosphorothiolate linkage, which, upon cleavage by topoisomerase I, generates a free 5′-sulfhydryl unable to participate in strand religation (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

The use of 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkages to trap covalent complexes has been successfully employed to examine several enzymes that form transient 3′-phosphotyrosine linkages, including eukaryotic type IB topoisomerases, viral topoisomerases, and bacterial and phage tyrosine recombinases and integrases (8Staker B.L.

Detailed biochemical studies have shown that the presence of a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkage has a marginal effect on the rate of cleavage by such enzymes (down ∼2-fold), but lowers the rate of religation by at least 10,000-fold (24Krogh B.O. Cheng C. Burgin A. Shuman S. Virology. 1999; 264: 441-451Google Scholar). In addition, x-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that when the active form of human topoisomerase I (with the Tyr-723 residue intact) is used for crystallization, a bridging phosphorothiolate linkage is required to obtain crystals (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar).We determined the 3.1 Å crystal structure of a human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with a 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing Ara-C at the +1 position of the non-scissile DNA strand to elucidate the structural impact of Ara-C on this enzyme. This is only the third structure of a covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complex reported to date (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). We find that Ara-C introduces numerous subtle structural changes, including changes in sugar pucker and base position, that contribute to a new positioning of the free 5′-sulfhydryl away from the 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage. Thus, the single-strand religation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is decreased, producing a longer lived covalent protein-DNA complex.DiscussionThe leukemia drug Ara-C contains a arabinose sugar ring rather than the ribose standard to DNA and RNA bases. As such, its 2′-hydroxyl group is oriented in a manner distinct from the equivalent RNA cytosine base (Fig. 1). Ara-C is thought to elicit its antineoplastic effects by acting as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerases α and ॆ (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar,17Schweitzer B.I. Mikita T. Kellogg G.W. Gardner K.H. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11460-11475Google Scholar, 41Grant S. Front. Biosc. 1997; 2: 242-252Google Scholar). Even at low concentrations, however, the drug becomes incorporated into DNA and disrupts DNA metabolism (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar, 17Schweitzer B.I. Mikita T. Kellogg G.W. Gardner K.H. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11460-11475Google Scholar, 41Grant S. Front. Biosc. 1997; 2: 242-252Google Scholar). Pourquier et al. (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar) have shown that the presence of an Ara-C base at the +1 position of the intact strand (opposite the site of single-strand cleavage) slows the rate of DNA strand religation by human topoisomerase I 2–3-fold (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar). The extended lifetime of the covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complex may contribute to antineoplastic effects of Ara-C by enhancing chromosomal instability. Indeed, human leukemia cells that lack detectable levels of topoisomerase I are resistant to the effects of Ara-C (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar).We determined the 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with a 22-base pair DNA duplex containing Ara-C at the +1 position of the intact strand (Fig. 2). The structure reveals that the Ara-C non-standard 2′-hydroxyl introduces numerous subtle structural changes, particularly the +1 base pair (Fig.4A). The 2′-hydroxyl of Ara-C forms a hydrogen bond with the O4′ of the −1 sugar, which stabilizes the C3′-endo pucker exhibited by the arabinose ring of Ara-C (Fig. 4B). These structural changes cause the +1 base pair of the duplex to shift in position relative to the equivalent base pair in a covalent topoisomerase I DNA complex without a site of damage reported previously (1A31; Ref. 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). This, in turn, appears to cause the free 5′-sulfhydryl (which replaces the 5′-hydroxyl in this trapped covalent complex; 8, 19, 23–28) in the nicked DNA strand to shift away from the covalent phosphotyrosine linkage and form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-722, an interaction not observed in previous topoisomerase I covalent complexes (Figs. 4A and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the subtle change of the duplex opposite the single-strand DNA break shifts the free 5′-end of the nicked strand away from the covalent 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage. These results likely explain the impact on topoisomerase I activity reported by Pourquier et al. (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar).This Ara-C structure provides additional insight into the catalytic mechanism of human topoisomerase I. As the active site residues are brought into place upon DNA binding, Asn-722 does not appear to contact the DNA, as observed in several non-covalent topoisomerase I DNA complexes (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Google Scholar, 13Lesher D-T.T. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12102-12107Google Scholar, 20Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 685-696Google Scholar, 21Redinbo M.R. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Google Scholar). However, as the downstream region of DNA undergoes relaxation by the proposed controlled rotation mechanism, Asn-722 may have ample opportunity to hydrogen bond with the free 5′-hydroxyl of the nicked strand. Indeed, after relaxation slows, Asn-722 may play a crucial role via hydrogen bonding in guiding the 5′-hydroxyl into place for the religation phase of catalysis. This interaction is likely to be transitory in reactions involving non-damaged DNA. The change caused by the Ara-C base appears to stabilize this interaction, allowing us to visualize it in the structure presented here.The importance of Asn-722 in human topoisomerase I and the equivalent Asn-726 in S. cerevisiae topoisomerase I in the catalytic cycle and camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme have been established by several careful biochemical studies. For example, mutation of Asn-722 to histidine in human topoisomerase I increases the rate of DNA cleavage, while mutation to aspartic acid decreases the DNA binding affinity of the enzyme (38Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Google Scholar). An N722S mutation in human topoisomerase I, in contrast, does not impact the catalytic activity of the enzyme but does reduce its sensitivity to camptothecin (40Fertala J. Vance J.R. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15246-15253Google Scholar). We provide structural evidence in this and previous work that sites of DNA damage impact the ability of Asn-722 to align the active site of human topoisomerase I both before and after single-strand DNA cleavage by the enzyme (13Lesher D-T.T. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12102-12107Google Scholar). This residue may play a similar role with other DNA lesions that impact human topoisomerase I, including ethenoadenine adducts, wobble base pairs, and uracil mismatches. In summary, we show that relatively subtle modifications caused by the presence of a single 2′-hydroxyl group on the opposite side of the substrate DNA duplex can alter the structure of the human topoisomerase I active site and impact the catalytic action of the enzyme. Human topoisomerase I solves the DNA topological problems that arise from a wide variety of nuclear processes including replication, transcription, and recombination (1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Google Scholar). The enzyme nicks one strand of duplex DNA using a transesterification reaction that produces a transient 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage and guides the relaxation of either positive or negative superhelical tension by a proposed 舠controlled rotation舡 mechanism (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Google Scholar). The enzyme then catalyzes a second transesterification in which the free hydroxyl at the 5′-end of the nicked DNA strand attacks the phosphotyrosine bond, resealing the nick, and releasing a more relaxed DNA molecule. Topoisomerase I plays a vital role in maintaining DNA stability and is known to travel with active replication and transcription complexes in human cells (4Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Google Scholar,5Holden J.A. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Cancer Agents. 2001; 1: 1-25Google Scholar). Human topoisomerase I is the sole target of the camptothecins (CPT), a potent class of anticancer drugs used to treat late-term solid malignancies (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Google Scholar, 4Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Google Scholar, 6Hsiang Y.H. Hertzberg R. Hecht S. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14873-14878Google Scholar). Camptothecin effectively targets the religation phase of topoisomerase I catalysis by stabilizing the covalent protein-DNA complex and trapping the enzyme on DNA (7Hertzberg R.P. Caranfa M.J.

Structures of covalent human topoisomerase I-DNA complexes containing an intact 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage have also been reported (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B.

In these trapped covalent protein-DNA complexes, the scissile phosphate contained a bridging phosphorothiolate linkage, which, upon cleavage by topoisomerase I, generates a free 5′-sulfhydryl unable to participate in strand religation (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

The use of 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkages to trap covalent complexes has been successfully employed to examine several enzymes that form transient 3′-phosphotyrosine linkages, including eukaryotic type IB topoisomerases, viral topoisomerases, and bacterial and phage tyrosine recombinases and integrases (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.

Detailed biochemical studies have shown that the presence of a 5′-bridging phosphorothiolate linkage has a marginal effect on the rate of cleavage by such enzymes (down ∼2-fold), but lowers the rate of religation by at least 10,000-fold (24Krogh B.O. Cheng C. Burgin A. Shuman S. Virology. 1999; 264: 441-451Google Scholar). In addition, x-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that when the active form of human topoisomerase I (with the Tyr-723 residue intact) is used for crystallization, a bridging phosphorothiolate linkage is required to obtain crystals (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). We determined the 3.1 Å crystal structure of a human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with a 22-base pair oligonucleotide containing Ara-C at the +1 position of the non-scissile DNA strand to elucidate the structural impact of Ara-C on this enzyme. This is only the third structure of a covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complex reported to date (8Staker B.L. Hjerrild K. Feese M.D. Behnke C.A. Burgin A.B. Stewart L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15387-15392Google Scholar, 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). We find that Ara-C introduces numerous subtle structural changes, including changes in sugar pucker and base position, that contribute to a new positioning of the free 5′-sulfhydryl away from the 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage. Thus, the single-strand religation reaction catalyzed by the enzyme is decreased, producing a longer lived covalent protein-DNA complex. DiscussionThe leukemia drug Ara-C contains a arabinose sugar ring rather than the ribose standard to DNA and RNA bases. As such, its 2′-hydroxyl group is oriented in a manner distinct from the equivalent RNA cytosine base (Fig. 1). Ara-C is thought to elicit its antineoplastic effects by acting as a competitive inhibitor of DNA polymerases α and ॆ (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y.

Front. Biosc. 1997; 2: 242-252Google Scholar). Even at low concentrations, however, the drug becomes incorporated into DNA and disrupts DNA metabolism (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar, 17Schweitzer B.I. Mikita T. Kellogg G.W. Gardner K.H. Beardsley G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11460-11475Google Scholar, 41Grant S. Front. Biosc. 1997; 2: 242-252Google Scholar). Pourquier et al. (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar) have shown that the presence of an Ara-C base at the +1 position of the intact strand (opposite the site of single-strand cleavage) slows the rate of DNA strand religation by human topoisomerase I 2–3-fold (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar). The extended lifetime of the covalent topoisomerase I-DNA complex may contribute to antineoplastic effects of Ara-C by enhancing chromosomal instability. Indeed, human leukemia cells that lack detectable levels of topoisomerase I are resistant to the effects of Ara-C (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar).We determined the 3.1 Å resolution crystal structure of human topoisomerase I in covalent complex with a 22-base pair DNA duplex containing Ara-C at the +1 position of the intact strand (Fig. 2). The structure reveals that the Ara-C non-standard 2′-hydroxyl introduces numerous subtle structural changes, particularly the +1 base pair (Fig.4A). The 2′-hydroxyl of Ara-C forms a hydrogen bond with the O4′ of the −1 sugar, which stabilizes the C3′-endo pucker exhibited by the arabinose ring of Ara-C (Fig. 4B). These structural changes cause the +1 base pair of the duplex to shift in position relative to the equivalent base pair in a covalent topoisomerase I DNA complex without a site of damage reported previously (1A31; Ref. 19Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Google Scholar). This, in turn, appears to cause the free 5′-sulfhydryl (which replaces the 5′-hydroxyl in this trapped covalent complex; 8, 19, 23–28) in the nicked DNA strand to shift away from the covalent phosphotyrosine linkage and form a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-722, an interaction not observed in previous topoisomerase I covalent complexes (Figs. 4A and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that the subtle change of the duplex opposite the single-strand DNA break shifts the free 5′-end of the nicked strand away from the covalent 3′-phosphotyrosine linkage. These results likely explain the impact on topoisomerase I activity reported by Pourquier et al. (12Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Google Scholar).This Ara-C structure provides additional insight into the catalytic mechanism of human topoisomerase I. As the active site residues are brought into place upon DNA binding, Asn-722 does not appear to contact the DNA, as observed in several non-covalent topoisomerase I DNA complexes (3Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Google Scholar, 13Lesher D-T.T. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6832-6840Google Scholar). However, as the downstream region of DNA undergoes relaxation by the proposed controlled rotation mechanism, Asn-722 may have ample opportunity to hydrogen bond with the free 5′-hydroxyl of the nicked strand. Indeed, after relaxation slows, Asn-722 may play a crucial role via hydrogen bonding in guiding the 5′-hydroxyl into place for the religation phase of catalysis. This interaction is likely to be transitory in reactions involving non-damaged DNA. The change caused by the Ara-C base appears to stabilize this interaction, allowing us to visualize it in the structure presented here.The importance of Asn-722 in human topoisomerase I and the equivalent Asn-726 in S. cerevisiae topoisomerase I in the catalytic cycle and camptothecin sensitivity of the enzyme have been established by several careful biochemical studies. For example, mutation of Asn-722 to histidine in human topoisomerase I increases the rate of DNA cleavage, while mutation to aspartic acid decreases the DNA binding affinity of the enzyme (38Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Google Scholar). An N722S mutation in human topoisomerase I, in contrast, does not impact the catalytic activity of the enzyme but does reduce its sensitivity to camptothecin (40Fertala J. Vance J.R. Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15246-15253Google Scholar). We provide structural evidence in this and previous work that sites of DNA damage impact the ability of Asn-722 to align the active site of human topoisomerase I both before and after single-strand DNA cleavage by the enzyme (13Lesher D-T.T. Pommier Y. Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12102-12107Google Scholar). This residue may play a similar role with other DNA lesions that impact human topoisomerase I, including ethenoadenine adducts, wobble base pairs, and uracil mismatches. In summary, we show that relatively subtle modifications caused by the presence of a single 2′-hydroxyl group on the opposite side of the substrate DNA duplex can alter the structure of the human topoisomerase I active site and impact the catalytic action of the enzyme.

Therefore, to elucidate the structural basis for specific dimerization of rod PDE6, we constructed a series of chimeric proteins between PDE6αβ and PDE5, which contain the N-terminal GAFa/GAFb domains, or portions thereof, of the rod enzyme. These chimeras were co-expressed in Sf9 cells in various combinations as His-, myc-, or FLAG-tagged proteins. Dimerization of chimeric PDEs was assessed using gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The composition of formed dimeric enzymes was analyzed with Western blotting and immunoprecipitation. Consistent with the selectivity of PDE6 dimerization in vivo, efficient heterodimerization was observed between the GAF regions of PDE6α and PDE6β with no significant homodimerization. In addition, PDE6α was able to form dimers with the cone PDE6α′ subunit.

GAF domains have been recognized as a large family of domain homologues and named for their presence in cGMP-regulated PDEs, adenylyl cyclases, and theE. coli protein Fh1A (16Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Besides PDE6, several other PDE families possess GAF domains, including cGMP-stimulated PDE (PDE2), PDE5 (13McAllister-Lucas L.M. Sonnenburg W.K. Kadlecek A. Seger D. Trong H.L. Colbran J.L.

At least one of the two GAF domains in the PDE2, PDE5, and PDE6 catalytic subunits serves as a site for noncatalytic binding of cGMP. Noncatalytic cGMP binding to GAF domains affects the catalytic properties of PDE2 and PDE5 (21Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Corbin J.D. Turko I.V. Beasley A. Francis S.H. Eur. J.

In PDE6, noncatalytically bound cGMP appears to enhance the affinity of the inhibitory interaction between Pγ and the catalytic core (25Cote R.H. Bownds M.D. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4845-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 26Mou H. Cote R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27527-27534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The second major function of the GAF domains is their role in dimerization of the PDE catalytic subunits. Earlier biochemical studies of PDE2 and PDE5 indicated that their dimerization occurs within the N-terminal parts of the molecules (18Stroop S.D. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23802-23809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Thomas M.K. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14964-14970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ultimate evidence on the intersubunit interface of PDE2 has been recently provided by a solution of the crystal structure of PDE2A GAFa-GAFb domains (28Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The crystal structure revealed that the PDE2A regulatory region forms a dimer with the interface formed by the two GAFa domains (28Martinez S.E. Wu A.Y. Glavas N.A. Tang X.B. Turley S. Hol W.G. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The role of PDE6 GAF domains in dimerization is supported by recent electron microscopy imaging of rod PDE6αβ (29Kameni Tcheudji J.F. Lebeau L. Virmaux N. Maftei C.G. Cote R.H. Lugnier C. Schultz P. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The imaging showed that the main intersubunit interaction occurs between the very N-terminal domains, presumably involving GAFa modules, and indicated that the GAFb domains may also contribute to the interface. Almost all PDEs known to date are dimeric. However, the role of dimerization in enzyme function is not understood. Dimerization is not required for catalytic activity, because the isolated monomeric catalytic domain of PDE5 (30Fink T.L. Francis S.H. Beasley A. Grimes K.A. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34613-34620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and the monomeric short splice variant PDE4D2 (31Richter W. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40212-40221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) have been shown to be catalytically active. Furthermore, a majority of PDEs, with a notable exception of rod PDE6αβ, form catalytic homodimers (3Beavo J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 725-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar, 4Francis S.H. Turko I.V. Corbin J.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 65: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the possibility of minor homodimeric species, αα and ββ, has not been ruled out, the dominant catalytic species of rod PDE6 is clearly a heterodimer αβ (32Fung B.K.-K. Young J.M. Yamane H.K. Griswold-Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 33Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The functional significance of heterodimerization of rod PDE remains unclear. It is as yet unknown if the catalytic characteristics of PDE6α and PDE6β in the dimer are equivalent. To circumvent the problem of a lack of efficient expression of PDE6 in various cell types (34Piriev N.I. Yamashita C. Samuel G. Farber D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9340-9344Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Qin N. Baehr W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3265-3271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have previously developed a robust system for expression of PDE6α′/PDE5 chimeras in insect cells (36Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In this study, we extended this approach to chimeras between PDE6αβ and PDE5 to investigate the structural basis for specific dimerization of the rod PDE6 catalytic subunits. A series of chimeric proteins between PDE6 and PDE5 have been constructed that contain the GAFa and/or GAFb domains of PDE6 or PDE5. These chimeras were expressed in Sf9 cells in various combinations as His-, myc-, or FLAG-tagged proteins. The dimerization of chimeric PDE6 subunits was assessed using gel filtration, sucrose gradient centrifugation, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG- and anti-myc-specific antibodies. The patterns of dimerization of chimeric PDE6/PDE5 subunits are consistent with the selectivity of PDE6 dimerization in rod photoreceptor cells. Our results indicate that the PDE6 GAFa domains contain major structural determinants for the affinity and selectivity of dimerization of PDE6 catalytic subunits. cGMP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [3H]cGMP was a product of AmershamBiosciences. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England BioLabs. AmpliTaq® DNA polymerase was a product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Pfu DNA polymerase was a product of Stratagene. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Bovine holo-PDE6 was extracted from bleached rod outer segment membranes and purified as described previously (33Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To construct PDE6α/PDE5 chimera FLAG-α-α-5 (see Fig. 1), the FLAG tag DNA sequence was first inserted into the pFastBacHTb vector (Invitrogen) replacing the His6 sequence. A DNA fragment was PCR-amplified using pFastBacHTb as a template, a 5′-primer containing an RsrII site and the FLAG tag sequence, and a 3′-primer containing a BamHI site. This fragment was then ligated with the large RsrII/BamHI fragment of pFastBacHTb to produce pFastBacFLAG. A bovine retinal cDNA library kindly provided by Dr. W. Baehr (University of Utah) was used as a template for PCR amplifications of PDE6αβ sequences. DNA coding for PDE6α-1–443 was PCR-amplified using primers carryingBamHI and HindIII sites. DNA coding for PDE5–506-865 amino acids was PCR-amplified using the pFastBacHTb-PDE5 template (36Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and primers with the HindIII andXhoI sites. The two PCR products were ligated into the pFastBacFLAG vector using the BamHI and XhoI sites. The myc tag DNA sequence was inserted into the pFastBacHTb vector using a PCR-directed cloning procedure similar to the insertion of the FLAG tag sequence. The construct for chimera myc-β-β-5 (see Fig. 1) was generated by ligation of the PCR-amplified PDE6β-1–441 and PDE5–506-865 DNAs into the BamHI and XhoI sites of pFastBacmyc. The His-tagged PDE6αβ/PDE5 chimeras were constructed by amplifying appropriate regions of the PDE6αβ subunits with primers containing unique restriction sites. When unique restriction sites were not available at the desired location, first-round PCR products coding chimeric junctions were extended to the nearest unique sites in a second-round PCR amplification. To improve the recognition of the His6 tag by commercial antibodies, the His6flanking sequence in the original pFastBacHTb vector was replaced by the His6 flanking sequence from pET-15b (Novagen). The DNA sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA core facility. Generation of the recombinant bacmids, transfection of Sf9 cells, and viral amplifications were carried out according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen). For protein expression, Sf9 cell cultures (10 ml, 2 × 106 cells/ml) were infected with one or two different viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 3–10. Sf9 cells were harvested at 48 h after infection by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. Sf9 cells were resuspended in 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2 mm MgSO4 and CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture (one-third tablet) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and sonicated with two 10-s pulses using a microtip attached to a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific). Sf9 cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 90 min, 2 °C), dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 130 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 50% glycerin, and then centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 2 °C. Dialysis against 50% glycerin allowed a concentration of PDE samples by ∼4-fold and subsequent storage at −20 °C without freezing. The presence of glycerin did not affect the behavior of PDEs in gel filtration. Aliquots of dialyzed PDE samples (50–200 μl) were injected into a Superose® 12 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated at 25 °C with 30 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 100 mmNaCl and 2 mm MgSO4. Proteins were eluted at 0.4 ml/min, and 0.4-ml fractions were collected starting at 17 min post-injection. Each fraction was assayed for PDE activity, protein concentration, and the presence of chimeric PDEs by Western blotting. PDE activity was measured using 10- to 20-μl aliquots from fractions and 5 μm [3H]cGMP as described previously (37Thompson W.J. Appleman M.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Natochin M. Artemyev N.O. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 539-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using IgG as a standard (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). The column was calibrated with the following protein standards: bovine thyroglobulin (670 kDa, 85 Å), horse ferritin (440 kDa, 61 Å), sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), rabbit aldolase (158 kDa, 48.1 Å), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 35.5 Å), and chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa, 30.5 Å). The Stokes radii for PDEs were estimated using the correlation of elution volume with the Stokes radius proposed by Porath (40Porath J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1963; 6: 233-244Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Gel filtration analyses were performed two or more times with similar results for each PDE chimera combination from at least two different preparations of Sf9 cell extracts. Results of a typical analysis are shown. Western blot analysis of the gel filtration fractions (20-μl aliquots) was performed following SDS-PAGE in 10% gels (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-polyhistidine, M2 monoclonal anti-FLAG, and monoclonal anti-c-myc (clone 9E10) antibodies (Sigma) with the respective dilutions of 1:1500, 1:5000, and 1:5000 were utilized. The antibody·antigen complexes were detected using anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). The compositions of PDE complexes in fractions corresponding to dimeric enzymes were examined by immunoprecipitation (IP). Aliquots of the gel filtration fractions (80 μl) were incubated with or without anti-FLAG or myc-antibodies (1 μl) for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 5 μl of protein G-Agarose (Sigma) and incubation for 40 min at 25 °C. The agarose beads were washed four times with 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.1), and the bound proteins were eluted with an SDS-PAGE sample buffer. PDE complexes were separated on 10% gels and analyzed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. Sucrose density gradients (5–35%) were prepared in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, and 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol using a GradiFrac gradient former (Amersham Biosciences). Protein standards or aliquots of 200 μl from peak PDE gel filtration fractions were loaded onto the gradients in 14- × 89-mm centrifugation tubes and centrifuged for 24 h at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions of 300 μl were collected starting from the bottom of the tubes. Fractions from the tubes with protein standards were analyzed for protein concentration, whereas fractions from the tubes containing PDE samples were analyzed for PDE activity. Sucrose density centrifugations were performed two times with similar results for each PDE preparation. Results of a typical analysis are shown. The protein standards were: bovine liver catalase (250 kDa, 11.3 S), rabbit aldolase (158 kDa, 7.3 S), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa, 4.6 S), and chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa, 3.5 S). Sedimentation coefficients (s 20,w) for chimeric PDEs were estimated using a linear plot of distances traveled by standards from meniscus versus the s 20,wvalues of standards (42Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weights of PDEs were calculated using the estimated sedimentation coefficients, the Stokes radii obtained from the gel filtration data, and the following equation (43Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), M=(s·NA·6·π·η·r)/(1−v·ρ)Equation 1 where s is the sedimentation coefficient;N A is Avogardo's number; η is the viscosity of the medium (0.01 g·cm−1·s−1),r is the Stokes radius; v is the partial specific volume of a protein (0.73 cm3·g−1), and ρ is the density of the medium (1 g·cm−3). Dimerization of PDE6 catalytic subunits is very tight, and, apparently, there is no exchange of subunits between dimers once they are formed following the synthesis and folding of the polypeptide chains. The dimer formation between chimeric PDE6/PDE5 subunits was therefore assessed following co-expression of these chimeras in Sf9 cells. Chimeric PDEs (Fig. 1) from soluble fractions of Sf9 cells as well as native PDE6 and recombinant wild-type PDE5 were examined by FPLC gel filtration on a calibrated Superose 12 HR 10/30 column and by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The elution profiles of native PDE6 and recombinant wild-type PDE5 on the gel filtration column were very similar and corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of ∼210 kDa (Fig. 2 A), which is consistent with dimerization of the catalytic subunits. Molecular masses of rod holoPDE6 (PDEαβγ2) and the PDE5 dimer calculated from the sequences were ∼217 and 197 kDa, respectively. Only relatively small fractions of the enzymes (∼15% PDE5 and ∼10% PDE6) migrated as aggregates with high molecular mass. The previously developed chimeric PDE, Chi4 (termed hereafter His-α′-α′-5), containing the cone PDE6α′ GAFa-GAFb region and the catalytic domain of PDE5 (36Granovsky A.E. Natochin M. McEntaffer R.L. Haik T.L. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24485-24490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), is predicted to form homodimers. The chromatographic behavior of His-α′-α′-5 on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column indicated an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig. 2 A), which is in good agreement with the theoretical molecular mass of 183 kDa for the α′-α′-5 homodimer. The fraction of aggregates in the chimeric PDE (∼10%) was similar to those in PDE5 and PDE6 preparations. We first constructed PDE6/PDE5 chimeras containing both the GAFa and GAFb domains from either rod PDE6α (α-α-5) or PDE6β (β-β-5) and the catalytic domain from PDE5 (Fig. 1). As generally defined by the PDE sequence alignment and the crystal structure (17Charbonneau H. Prusti R.K. LeTrong H. Sonnenburg W.K. Mullaney P.J. Walsh K.A. Beavo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2002; 99: 13260-13265Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), the boundaries of the GAFa domains are PDE6α-54–220 and PDE6β-52–218, and the boundaries of the GAFb domains are PDE6α-255–443 and PDE6β-253–441. The nonconserved N termini, PDE6α-1–53 in α-α-5 and PDE6β-1–51 in β-β-5, were from the respective catalytic subunits. Chimera α-α-5 was constructed for expression as a FLAG-tagged protein, whereas β-β-5 was generated as a myc-tagged polypeptide. Gel filtration fractions were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of chimeric PDE proteins and for PDE activity with cGMP as the substrate. Individual expression of FLAG-α-α-5 or myc-β-β-5 resulted in the formation of only high molecular weight aggregates that migrated with the exclusion volume of the Superose 12 column (Fig. 2, B and C). Furthermore, the aggregates also migrated with the exclusion volume on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (not shown), which is capable of separating proteins weighing up to 1 × 106 kDa. Notably, these aggregates were capable of hydrolyzing cGMP. When FLAG-α-α-5 and myc-β-β-5 were co-expressed in Sf9 cells, a peak of PDE activity appeared in the fractions corresponding to dimeric PDE species with an apparent molecular mass of ∼200 kDa (Fig.3 A). Approximately 50% of the total soluble FLAG/myc-tagged protein formed the dimeric enzyme. In the peak activity fractions 11 and 12, the enzyme hydrolyzed cGMP with aK m value of 3.8 μm and aV max of 21 nmol/min/mg of protein. The Western blot analysis of these fractions using anti-FLAG and anti-myc antibodies confirmed the presence of both FLAG-α-α-5 and myc-β-β-5 (Fig. 3 A). A sizable peak of PDE activity was also present in fractions corresponding to aggregates of FLAG-α-α-5 and myc-β-β-5 (Fig. 3 A). The aggregation appears to be irreversible, because re-chromatography of the fractions with aggregates did not generate dimeric enzymes (not shown). Considering the intensity of immunostaining, the catalytic activity of these aggregated PDE species is 1.5- to 2-fold lower than that of the dimeric PDE species. To verify the nature of the dimeric species, chimeric PDE was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and then probed with anti-myc antibodies using Western blotting. The results of the IP experiments proved the formation of a heterodimer between FLAG-α-α-5 or myc-β-β-5 (Fig. 3 A). The peak of dimeric PDE activity on the gel filtration column was relatively broad. To determine if this PDE might be heterogeneous, the combined concentrated front fractions 9–11 and tail fractions 13–16 were reapplied onto the column. The resulting PDE activity profiles were nearly identical, suggesting the presence of a single dimeric form of PDE and trace amounts of aggregates (Fig. 3 B). The molecular shape of a protein significantly influences its migration on a gel filtration column. Sucrose density centrifugation was utilized as an additional independent approach to estimate the molecular weight of chimeric PDEs (42Martin R.G. Ames B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1372-1379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sedimentation rates of native rod holoPDE6, recombinant PDE5, His-α′-α′-5, and the FLAG-α-α-5·myc-β-β-5 complex were similar (Fig.3 C). An estimated s 20,w value of 8.1 for the FLAG-α-α-5·myc-β-β-5 complex corresponds well to the dimeric structure. Using this sedimentation coefficient and the Stokes radius of 52 Å derived from the gel filtration data (Fig.3 A) (40Porath J. Pure Appl. Chem. 1963; 6: 233-244Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar), Equation 1 (43Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar) yields a molecular mass of 176 kDa, which is comparable to the theoretical molecular mass (184 kDa) for the FLAG-α-α-5·myc-β-β-5 dimer. Next, we examined the possibility of dimerization of PDE6α and PDE6β with cone PDE6α′ and PDE5. FLAG-α-α-5 and myc-β-β-5 each were co-expressed with His-α′-α′-5 or His-PDE5. Because PDE6α′ and PDE5 form catalytic homodimers, a peak of PDE activity in gel filtration fractions corresponding to dim"

A. 1988; 95: 8625-8629Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism by which these proteins mediate LCFA import is poorly understood. Given its plasma membrane localization, high level of expression in tissues with efficient LCFA import, and the ability of overexpressed FATP1 to facilitate LCFA uptake into cells, this protein was initially proposed to function as a transporter or shuttle for moving LCFAs across the plasma membrane. Gain and loss of function studies suggest that FATP1 and its yeast ortholog also have very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity (4Coe N. Smith A. Frohnert B. Watkins P. Bernlohr D. J. Biol.

Based on site-directed mutagenesis experiments, FATP1 has been proposed to contain separable domains that function in transport and esterification, respectively (6DiRusso C. Connell E. Faergeman N. Knuddsen J. Hansen J. Black P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4422-4433Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence for the membrane topology of FATP1 supports a topology model with one transmembrane domain near the amino terminus of the protein (9Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The extreme amino terminus of the protein faces the extracellular space, and the carboxyl terminus faces the cytosol. The amino-terminal 190 amino acids are hydrophobic, and three stretches of sequence within this region are independently capable of directing integral membrane association of an enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter. Given that the amino terminus of FATP1 is extracellular and residues 191–257 are not membrane-associated and likely face the cytosol, we predict that FATP1 contains at least one transmembrane domain in the region between residues 1 and 190. Between residues 258 and the carboxyl terminus, at least two domains are capable of associating peripherally with the membrane, but no additional transmembrane or integral membrane domains have been identified. Overall, this proposed membrane topology does not resemble those of polytopic membrane transporters for hydrophilic substrates. Many classic transporters are predicted to have transmembrane domains consisting of primarily α-helical structures of 17 or more amino acids that span the phospholipid bilayer. Depending on the specific transporter, between 4 and 12 transmembrane domains are thought to form a three-dimensional channel through which the substrate passes. Unfavorable interactions between hydrophilic substrates and the hydrophobic core of the membrane may be minimized in such a model. However, it is unclear whether such a structure would be utilized for transport of amphipathic substrates, such as long chain fatty acids, that readily adsorb into membranes. Rather fatty acids may move across bilayers in direct contact with membrane phospholipids. On the other hand, some proteins that have been shown to facilitate transport of substrates when expressed in mammalian cells have few transmembrane domains. For example, a type II single membrane-spanning protein, the rbAT heavy chain, was expression-cloned on the basis of its ability to promote dibasic and neutral amino acid transport (10Wells R.G. Hediger M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5596-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 11Tate S.S. Yan N. Udenfriend S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein participates in a heterodimeric amino acid transport complex in which it is disulfide-linked to a polytopic membrane transport protein (light chain) (13Wagner C.A. Lang F. Broer S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1077-C1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, FATP1 may participate in an oligomeric cell surface fatty acid transport complex. The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that FATP1 molecules are capable of dimerizing and thereby extend our understanding of the mechanism of action of FATP proteins. Here we use several approaches to show that FATP1 forms detergent-resistant dimers that play a functional role in LCFA import into mammalian cells. We obtained BODIPY 3823 (4,4-difluoro-5-methyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-3-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid) from Molecular Probes, Protease Complete and Protein A- and Protein G-agarose from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M2) from Sigma-Aldrich Inc., mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (HA.11) from Covance Inc., mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (SC-40) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled IgGs from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., and Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagents from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Antibodies to native FATP1 sequences were generated as previously described (2Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

PCR was used to insert amino-terminal HA, amino-terminal Myc, and carboxyl-terminal FLAG tags into ΔU3FATP1 or ΔU3FATP1s250a mutant retroviral constructs (14Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28642-28650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Retrovirus was generated and used to transduce cells as previously described (17Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). PCR was used to clone fragments of FATP (amino acid residues 1–190, 191–475, or 476–646) into pCMVtag2 and pCMVtag3 vectors (Stratagene) and used to transfect COS7 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). To optimize expression of constructs containing residues 191–475 and residues 476–646,N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (Calbiochem) was included in the media at 10 μg/ml after transfection. PCR was also used to generate an HA-tagged FATP1 and a Myc-tagged FATP1s250a construct in the vector pcDNA3.1. Parental and retroviral-transduced NIH 3T3 cells were assayed for fatty acid uptake as previously described (14Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28642-28650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis of samples of 104propidium iodide-negative (live) cells was carried out in triplicate using a BD Biosciences FACScan. For assessment of FATP truncation constructs, 2 × 106COS7 cells were plated in 10-cm dishes on the day prior to transfection. Transfections of DNA (20 μg) with LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations were performed 24 h after transfection. For assays of dominant inhibitory function of mutant FATP, 8 × 105 COS7 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes. The following day, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 and 10 μg of total DNA, consisting of 1 μg of a construct for inactivated nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) (18Gallardo H.F. Tan C. Ory D. Sadelain M. Blood. 1997; 90: 952-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 3 μg of FATP1, and 0–6 μg of FATP1s250a or 6–0 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3.1). 48 h after transfection, cells were stained for NGFR using an R-phycoerythrin-coupled anti-NGFR antibody (Chromaprobe, 1:50 in PBS with 2% inactivated fetal bovine serum for 20 min at 4 °C) and assayed for uptake of BODIPY 3823. BODIPY fluorescence (FL1 channel) of phycoerythrin-positive cells (FL2 channel) was determined by flow cytometry. For Western blot analysis of FATP protein expression in various cell types, total protein or total post-nuclear membranes were isolated as described (19Chiu H. Kovacs A. Ford D. Hsu F. Garcia R. Herrero P. Saffitz J. Schaffer J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 813-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Proteins were quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce Chemical Co.). All manipulations were carried out at 4 °C. Cells were washed in PBS and lysed in TNET (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Protease Complete) containing iodoacetamide (100 μm). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Primary antisera were incubated with post-nuclear supernatants for 1 h at the following dilutions: αHA (1:100), αFLAG (1:750), and αMyc (1:50). Protein G-agarose beads were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 45 min. Beads were washed three times with TNET and once with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5–12% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.2-μm pore). Primary antibodies for Western analysis were used at the following dilutions: 1:5000 FATP1 (directed against amino acids 455–470), 1:1000 αHA, 1:440 αFLAG, and 1:500 αMyc. Detection was performed using HRP-coupled secondary antisera and Renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). NIH 3T3 cells expressing FATPnHA were treated with 100 μmiodoacetamide. Cells were lysed in TNET and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min. Molecular weight standards were added, and the protein sample was loaded onto a 25–35% continuous sucrose gradient. Gradients were centrifuged at 108,000 × g for 21 h. Fractions (0.3 ml) were collected, and FATP protein was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Chromatography standards (Sigma) included as markers in each gradient were ovalbumin (40 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and apoferritin (443 kDa). Fractions were analyzed for markers by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Western analysis of membrane proteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes probed with an antibody directed against FATP1 residues 455–470 reveals the expected 63-kDa FATP1 as well as a higher molecular mass species of ∼130 kDa (Fig. 1). Neither species is observed in pre-adipocytes, which do not express FATP1. A second antiserum directed against FATP1 residues 628–640 also recognizes proteins of both sizes (data not shown). These findings suggest that FATP1 participates in an oligomeric complex that is resistant to SDS denaturation. Although it is possible that FATP1 interacts with one or more other unidentified proteins in a hetero-oligomeric complex, the apparent size of this higher molecular weight species is consistent with participation of FATP1 in a homo-oligomeric complex. Lack of alteration in the intensity of this higher molecular weight species under non-reducing conditions (data not shown) suggests that it does not represent a disulfide-linked oligomer. To study the oligomeric state of FATP1, we generated and characterized several epitope-tagged FATP1 constructs in the ΔU3 retroviral vector. An amino-terminal HA tag (FATPnHA) or a carboxyl-terminal FLAG tag (FATPcFLAG) was inserted in-frame with FATP1 coding sequences. Constructs were transfected into 293GPG packaging cells to generate retrovirus for high level stable transduction of NIH 3T3 cells. Western blot analysis of cellular lysates shows similar levels of expression of wild type and mutant epitope-tagged forms of FATP1 using an antibody to native FATP1 residues for detection (Fig.2 A). Western analysis using epitope tag antibodies reveals that these antisera are specific and do not recognize other tags. In addition, we generated cells that co-express FATPnHA and FATPcFLAG. Each of these constructs was tested for function in fatty acid uptake assays using the fluorescent fatty acid analog BODIPY 3823 (Fig. 2 B). Compared with native FATP1, FATPnHA has similar activity for fatty acid uptake. As has been previously observed, FATPcFLAG is less efficient in promoting fatty acid uptake, possibly due to perturbation of protein conformation upon placement of the epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus (9Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells co-expressing both FATPnHA and FATPcFLAG have total FATP levels comparable to cells expressing either construct alone and comparable levels of fatty acid uptake. Similar to natively expressed FATP1, we observed the expected 63-kDa FATP and higher molecular weight species upon Western blot detection of epitope-tagged FATP1 constructs (Fig. 3). The 130-kDa protein species is most prominent when protein samples are not boiled prior to loading of samples onto the gel. Additionally, we observed a 200-kDa species in the non-boiled samples. These findings suggest that FATP1 forms SDS-resistant oligomers that are sensitive to boiling. These putative oligomers are not an artifact due to the presence of a particular epitope tag, because they are observed with native FATP1 sequences and with several different epitope tags. FATP1-containing oligomers from a Triton X-100 lysate of FATPnHA cells were also separated on continuous sucrose-density gradients. Fractions were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. The location of FATP1 in these fractions was compared with protein markers loaded within the same gradients. We observed a biphasic distribution of FATP with one peak occurring between the ovalbumin and albumin markers (40 and 66 kDa) and a second peak between the β-galactosidase and alcohol dehydrogenase markers (116 and 150 kDa) (Fig. 4). This biphasic distribution of FATP1 is consistent with the existence of both a monomeric and oligomeric form (∼130 kDa) of FATP1 within cells. To explore the molecular composition of the high molecular weight species containing FATP1, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments from cells that co-express FATPnHA and FATPcFLAG. Specifically, we sought to determine whether the differentially tagged FATP1 proteins interact with one another in a homo-oligomeric complex. Co-immunoprecipitation was observed from lysates prepared using a variety of detergents (Fig.5 A), suggesting that the higher molecular weight species observed by Western blot analysis represents homo-oligomers of FATP1. To confirm the specificity of this interaction, we performed immunoprecipitations from cells that co-express FATPnHA and FATPcFLAG in parallel with immunoprecipitations from cells that express only one or the other construct (Fig.5 B). In addition, we mixed Triton X-100 lysates from FATPnHA-expressing and FATPcFLAG-expressing cells prior to immunoprecipitation. We observed efficient co-immunoprecipitation only when the differentially tagged proteins are synthesized within the same cells but not when lysates from FATPnHA cells and from FATPcFLAG cells are mixed. These observations show that FATP1 molecules are capable of associating in an oligomer that contains at least two molecules of FATP1. Moreover, our results suggest that dimer formation occurs during the biosynthesis of FATP1 or that formation of dimers requires intact cellular membrane structure. In an effort to identify the region of FATP involved in dimerization, we generated a series of constructs containing domains of FATP1. Constructs containing residues 1–190 encompass the hydrophobic amino-terminal region that is integrally associated with membranes. Constructs containing residues 191–475 include the putative ATP-interacting site that is essential for FATP1 function as well as a region that is peripherally associated with membranes. Constructs containing residues 476–646 encompass a region of FATP1 that is soluble and projects into the cytosol (9Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In each instance, these sequences were fused in-frame with an amino-terminal HA or FLAG tag to facilitate detection. Constructs were co-expressed in COS7 cells and assayed for co-immunoprecipitation. Constructs containing residues 1–190 could not be expressed even in the presence of proteasomal inhibitors (data not shown) possibly due to misfolding or cytotoxicity. Thus, the contribution of the amino terminus of FATP1 to dimerization remains undetermined. On the other hand, constructs containing residues 191–475 or 476–646 were detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). The HA-(191–475) and FLAG-(191–475) constructs co-immunoprecipitate, as detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA and Western blot with anti-FLAG, and as detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG and Western blot with anti-HA. Neither HA-(191–475) nor FLAG-(191–475) co-immunoprecipitated with either epitope-tagged form of residues 476–646. Also, HA-(476–646) and FLAG-(476–646) did not co-immunoprecipitate. These results suggest that the region of FATP1 encoded by residues 191–475 contains a dimerization domain that is sufficient for self-association. To assess the contribution of FATP1 oligomers to fatty acid uptake, we expressed wild type and mutant FATP1 sequences in the same cells. We used an FATP1 mutant with a single conservative amino acid substitution at residue 250 that does not affect biosynthesis or targeting of the protein to the plasma membrane (14Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28642-28650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). When expressed at levels similar to that of the HA-tagged wild type FATP1, the Myc-tagged FATP1s250a mutant lacks the ability to facilitate fatty acid uptake (Fig.7, A and B), consistent with our prior studies. However, wild type and mutant Myc-tagged FATP1 co-immunoprecipitate equally well with wild type HA-tagged FATP1 (Fig. 7 C). Thus, although conservative mutation of residue 250 impairs fatty acid transport function of FATP1, this residue is not critical for formation of FATP1 dimers. To delineate whether the FATP1s250a mutant has dominant inhibitory effects on fatty acid transport, we transiently transfected COS7 cells with a constant amount of wild type FATPnHA and increasing amounts of FATPnMycs250a (Fig. 7 D). We observed a dose-dependent decline in fatty acid uptake as the ratio of mutant to wild type FATP1 DNA sequences increased, suggesting that the mutant has dominant inhibitory effects on fatty acid transport. This finding shows that FATP1 participates in oligomers that function in fatty acid uptake in live cells. The FATPs are a family of integral membrane proteins that play an important role in cellular lipid homeostasis. To date, no crystallographic data is available for any family members, although topology studies of FATP1 suggest that this protein has a single transmembrane domain. Determining the oligomeric state for FATPs is important for understanding the molecular mechanism by which FATP family proteins function. Based on the ability of our anti-FATP1 antisera to recognize higher molecular weight species in addition to the 63-kDa FATP1, we hypothesized that FATP1 participates in a cell surface fatty acid transport complex. In the present study, we provide the first evidence that FATP1 forms detergent-resistant dimers that play a functional role in fatty acid transport. Epitope-tagged full-length FATP1 molecules co-immunoprecipitate when they are co-expressed in cells. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using different domains of FATP1 demonstrate that residues 191–475 are sufficient for FATP1 dimerization. Based on our data, we propose in Fig. 8 a model for the structure of an FATP1 oligomer. Studies from our laboratory (14Stuhlsatz-Krouper S.M. Bennett N.E. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) have shown that single amino acid substitutions in the highly conserved IYTSGTTGXPK motif (amino acids 247–257) impair the function of FATP1 in fatty acid transport without altering its ability to be expressed or trafficked to the plasma membrane. This motif may play a role in binding ATP or in generation of an adenylated intermediate. Consistent with this model, our previous studies indicated that mutation of serine 250 to alanine or threonine 252 to alanine within this motif results in an FATP1 molecule that cannot be efficiently cross-linked to azido-ATP, unlike the wild type FATP1 that is readily cross-linked. We extend these observations in the present study to show that FATP1 molecules containing the serine 250 to alanine mutation have dominant inhibitory activity in fatty acid uptake assays. We did not observe a decrease in fatty acid uptake in NIH 3T3 or COS7 cells transfected with the non-functional FATP1s250a mutant alone compared with untransfected cells. Both NIH 3T3 and COS7 cells have minimal endogenous FATP1 expression (present study and Refs. 2Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

Although it is not possible to rule out a role for low level FATP1 expression in the low level of basal fatty acid uptake in these cells, this uptake may be mediated by other proteins in these cells, such as CD36 (21Abumrad N.A. el-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or FABPpm (22Isola L.M. Zhou S.-L. Kiang C.-L. Stump D.D. Bradbury M.W. Berk P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9866-9870Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this uptake may be non-protein-mediated (i.e. flip-flop) (23Kamp F. Zakim D. Zhang F. Noy N. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Stump D.D. Fan X. Berk P.D. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 509-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the FATP1s250a mutant would not be expected to affect fatty acid uptake mediated by these other mechanisms. Thus, to show dominant inhibitory function of the FATP1s250a mutant, we first expressed wild type FATP1 in these cells and then examined the effects of increasing amounts of the FATP1s250a mutant. We observed a clear, dosage-dependent effect, with greater decreases in fatty acid uptake as the ratio of mutant/wild type FATP1 increases. We have also observed that NIH 3T3 cells co-transduced with mutant and wild type FATP1 retroviruses have decreased fatty acid uptake compared with NIH 3T3 cells transduced with wild type FATP1 virus alone (not shown). To identify the minimal region necessary for dimerization, we employed a series of FATP1 truncation constructs. Although the carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 476–646) does not associate with residues 191–475 and does not self associate, the region containing residues 191–475 is capable of self-association. This suggests that this region may be sufficient for dimerization of full-length FATP1 molecules. Although residues 191–257 are hydrophilic, hydrophobic interactions involving residues between amino acids 258 and 475 may contribute to oligomerization. Unfortunately, we were unable to assess the contribution of the hydrophobic amino-terminal region of FATP1 to dimerization, because truncation constructs containing amino acids 1–190 could not be expressed. Although truncation constructs enable assessment of the contribution of various structural elements to dimerization, these constructs are unlikely to support the fatty acid transport function of FATP1 because they lack significant regions of FATP1 sequence. In future studies, more detailed site-directed mutagenesis may facilitate analysis of the potential contributions to dimerization of specific residues in both the amino-terminal and middle section of FATP1. Such constructs may also be useful in assessing whether dimerization plays a role in the synthesis and targeting of FATP1 to the plasma membrane and in its stability there. The observation that FATP1 present in Triton X-100 lysates from different cells are unable to associate in vitro suggests that dimerization requires the structures and/or proteins present normally in cells expressing FATP1. Formation of FATP1 dimers may require the membrane-associated conformation of FATP1. On the other hand, FATP1 dimerization may depend on the presence of chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi. FATP1 is co-translationally inserted into membranes and likely traffics from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi to intracellular vesicles (25Stahl A. Evans J.G. Pattel S. Hirsch D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) prior to its appearance at the plasma membrane. It is unclear at what point FATP1 dimerization occurs. Formally, it is possible that FATP1 dimerizes due to indirect interactions, with another cellular protein at the interface of two FATP1 molecules, although the 130-kDa oligomer is most consistent with an FATP1 dimer. The observation that FATP1 molecules co-immunoprecipitate in a range of detergent solubilization conditions suggest that dimerization is not a detergent-specific effect. Although our studies provide evidence for FATP1 dimers as constituents of the cell surface fatty acid transport complex, it is possible that these FATP1 molecules associate with other, as yet to be determined molecules that might play a role in facilitating or regulating this important physiologic process. Both our Western blot studies of non-boiled samples and our sucrose gradient analysis suggest that higher molecular weight complexes exist around 200 kDa. These could represent higher order oligomers of FATP1 or association of FATP1 dimers with one or more other proteins. Future studies in our laboratory will be aimed at identifying the molecular composition of these complexes. In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that FATP1 is capable of dimerization. Moreover, dimerization of FATP1 molecules plays a critical role in fatty acid transport across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. The dominant negative activity identified in FATP mutant s250a will be useful in probing the role of FATP-mediated fatty acid transport in both cultured cells and in animal models. Finally, the ability of FATP1 to form oligomers provides additional clues regarding FATP1 function that will guide future structure-function studies."

Importantly, to allow for the direct measurement of oQ formation, we have developed protocols for the preparation of homogeneous substrates; specifically, an overexpression system was constructed for tRNATyr in an E. coli queA deletion mutant to allow for the isolation of large quantities of substrate tRNA, and [U-ribosyl-14C]AdoMet was synthesized. The enzyme shows optimal activity at pH 8.7 in buffers containing various oxyanions, including acetate, carbonate, EDTA, and phosphate.

ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar). The phenomenon of nucleoside modification is perhaps the most remarkable of these events, imparting a rich structural diversity to tRNA not observed in other RNAs (4Bjork G.R. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar). Over 80 modified nucleosides have been characterized in tRNA (4Bjork G.R. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar), many of which are conserved across broad phylogenetic boundaries. In the main, the biochemical function of nucleoside modification in tRNA remains poorly understood, although roles from structural stabilization to modulation of translational fidelity have been revealed in a few cases (4Bjork G.R. Soll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. ASM Press, Washington D. C.1995: 165-206Google Scholar). The most structurally complex of these modified nucleosides is the hypermodified nucleoside queuosine (Q)1 (Fig.1), which contains a cyclopentenediol group appended to a (7-aminomethyl)-7-deazaguanine core structure and, in some mammalian tRNA, can be further modified by glycosylation with galactose or mannose (5Okada N. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 2931-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Queuosine and its derivatives occur exclusively at position 34 (the wobble position) in the anticodons of tRNAs coding for the amino acids asparagine, aspartic acid, histidine, and tyrosine (6Kersten H. BioFactors. 1988; 1: 27-29PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these tRNAs possess the genetically encoded anticodon sequence GUN (where N represents any nucleotide). Although otherwise ubiquitous throughout eukarya and bacteria, queuosine is inexplicably absent from the tRNA of yeast and mycoplasmaand is not found in the tRNA of archaea. A definitive picture of the biochemical function or functions of queuosine has yet to emerge, but it has been correlated with eukaryotic cell development and proliferation (7Kersten H. Kersten W.

Underlying most, if not all, of these phenomena is a role in modulating translational fidelity, consistent with the location of queuosine in the anticodon. However, evidence also exists that implicates queuosine (or the free base queuine) in signal transduction (19Reisser T. Langgut W. Kersten H. Eur. J.

Although queuosine is present in both eukarya and bacteria, only bacteria are capable of de novo queuosine biosynthesis (Fig.2). Eukaryotes utilize a salvage system and acquire queuosine as a nutrient factor and from intestinal flora (27Kirtland G.M. Morris T.D. Moore P.H. O'Brian J.J. Edmonds C.G. McCloskey J.A. Katze J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5633-5641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and insert queuine directly into the appropriate tRNA by the enzyme tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT) (28Shindo-Okada N. Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 395-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A related TGT is present in bacteria (29Okada N. Noguchi S. Kasai H. Shindo-Okada N. Ohgi T. Goto T. Nishimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3067-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in this case the substrate is the queuosine precursor 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine (preQ1) (Fig. 2), which appears to be derived from GTP (30Kuchino Y. Kasai H. Nihei K. Nishimura S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1976; 3: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Considerable effort has been directed over the past decade toward elucidating the catalytic mechanism (31Garcia G.A. Goodenough-Lashua M. Grosjean H. Benne R. Modification and Editing of RNA.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The only other enzyme identified in the pathway is S-adenosylmethionine:tRNA ribosyltransferase-isomerase (QueA), which catalyzes the penultimate step in the de novobiosynthesis of queuosine, the formation of epoxyqueuosine (oQ) via the addition of an epoxycyclopentanediol ring to preQ1-modified tRNAs (Fig.3). Remarkably, the epoxycyclopentanediol moiety of oQ originates from the ribosyl portion ofS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) (37Slany R.K. Bosl M. Crain P.F. Kersten H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7811-7817Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Slany R.K. Bosl M. Kersten H. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the first example of the stoichiometric use of AdoMet as a “ribosyl” donor in an enzymatic reaction. The overall reaction involves the elimination of both methionine and adenine from AdoMet, the transfer of the ribosyl moiety to tRNA, and its rearrangement to form an epoxycarbocycle.Figure 3The reaction catalyzed by QueA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) QueA has garnered considerable interest for its central role in the biosynthesis of queuosine, the unique utilization of AdoMet, and as a fascinating problem in fundamental mechanistic enzymology. The reaction catalyzed by QueA is unprecedented in biological systems, and the results of preliminary mechanistic studies are consistent with a catalytic mechanism involving sulfonium ylide and vinyl sulfonium intermediates (39Kinzie S.D. Thern B. Iwata-Reuyl D. Org. Lett. 2000; 2: 1307-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), species never before implicated in an enzymatic reaction. However, in contrast to TGT, the lack of an easily accessible activity assay has stymied the basic characterization and quantitative analysis of this remarkable enzyme and precluded detailed kinetic studies. We report here a solution to this problem with protocols for the preparation of appropriate substrates, the development of a quantitative assay for the reaction with short RNA substrates, the elucidation of optimal reaction conditions, the measurement of the steady-state kinetic parameters, and a preliminary evaluation of the importance of RNA structural information for recognition and catalysis by QueA.

Template DNA for the PCR-based amplification of the tgt structural gene from E. coli was prepared by isolation of the 1.8-kb SalI/BamHI fragment from the E. coli genomic clone pHH1 (40Reuter K. Slany R. Ullrich F. Kersten H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification oftgt was carried out with Pfu polymerase directed by the primers tgtSTART (5′-CGGTCGAC CATATGAAATTTGAACTGGACACCACCG-3′) and tgtSTOP (5′-GCGCAGGATCCTTATTAATATTAATCAACGTTCAAAGG-3′). Designed into tgtSTART were the restriction enzyme sitesSalI (italics) and NdeI (underlined), the later as part of the translation initiation codon (boldface type) for thetgt gene, whereas tgtSTOP contained a BamHI site (underlined) downstream from the translation termination codon. The PCR program included an initial hold for 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 10 cycles of 95 °C for 2 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 75 °C for 2.5 min, followed by a 7-min hold at 75 °C. After amplification, the PCR product was gel-purified (0.8% agarose), subjected to restriction digest with SalI/BamHI, and ligated into theSalI/BamHI sites of pBluescript II SK(+) to give the plasmid pBlue-TGT. The structure of the tgt gene was confirmed by sequencing and subcloned as anNdeI/BamHI fragment into theNdeI/BamHI sites of the E. coliexpression vector pET-11a to give the expression plasmid pET-TGT. To a cell-free extract of E. coli BL21(DE3)/pET-TGT in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added a solution of streptomycin sulfate (10% w/v) to a final concentration of 1% (w/v), and the solution was stirred for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 4 h, the supernatant was recovered and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 50 μm ZnSO4. Approximately 5 mg of crude protein was then loaded onto a POROS HQ column (4.6 × 100 mm) equilibrated with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mm DTT (buffer A). A series of linear gradients were developed from buffer A to 2.0 m KCl in buffer A (buffer B) with a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and TGT elution was determined by activity assays and SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing TGT, which eluted at 0.24 m KCl, were pooled, concentrated with Centriprep YM-30 units, and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 μmZnSO4. The TGT sample was then subjected to cation exchange chromatography on POROS HS (4.6 × 100 mm) equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.0 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT (buffer C). A series of linear gradients were developed from buffer C to 2.0 m KCl in buffer C (buffer D) with a flow rate of 5 ml/min, and TGT elution was determined by activity assays and SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing TGT were concentrated with Centriprep YM-30 units, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 2 mm DTT, and stored as a 40% glycerol stock at −90 °C. The TGT was judged to be >95% pure by SDS-PAGE. An enzymatic synthesis was used to produce [U-ribosyl-14C]ATP from [U-14C]glucose. The synthesis was carried out according to Parkin et al.

The fractions containing the purified ATP were pooled, lyophilized to dryness, and dissolved in water. Concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy (ε260 = 15.4 × 103m−1 cm−1). After correcting for the loss of 14CO2, the radiochemical yield was typically 85–95%. The purified [U-ribosyl-14C]ATP was used in an enzymatic reaction to produce [U-ribosyl-14C]AdoMet essentially as described by Park et al. (49Park J. Tai J. Roessner C.A. Scott A.I. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996; 4: 2179-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). [U-ribosyl-14C]AdoMet was purified by HPLC using a semipreparative Hypersil 5 C18 column (250 × 10 mm, 5 μm). The column was developed under isocratic conditions of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6.0) and 2% methanol at a flow rate of 3 ml/min, and the fractions containing [U-ribosyl-14C]AdoMet were pooled, lyophilized to dryness, and dissolved in 10 mmH2SO4. The radiochemical yields were typically >90%. Concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy (ε260 = 14.9 × 103m−1 cm−1). The purity of the [U-ribosyl-14C]AdoMet was checked by comparing with authentic material (Sigma) by TLC and HPLC.

The structure of the tRNATyr gene of the resultant plasmid pTrc-Tyr was confirmed by sequencing. Production cultures ofE. coli K12QueA/pTrc-Tyr were grown in LB/amp until theA 600 reached 0.9–1.0, when overexpression of the tRNATyr gene was induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. To determine the appropriate harvesting times for optimal production of preQ1-tRNATyr, 3-ml aliquots were removed immediately before and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 13 h postinduction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The RNA was extracted from the samples using PUREscript RNA isolation kits (Gentra Systems, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's directions. The RNA samples and commercial E. colitRNATyr were then analyzed by HPLC on W-POREX 5 C4 column (250 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex) using a modification of the mobile phase developed by Pearson et al. (51Pearson J.D. Mitchell M. Regnier F.E. J. Liq. Chromatogr. 1983; 6: 1441-1457Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the large scale isolation of preQ1-tRNATyr, 500-ml cultures were allowed to grow 13 h postinduction when the cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cells were stored at −90 °C until further use. The acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method was used to lyse cells and extract ribonucleic acids (52Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63183) Google Scholar). After washing the crude RNA pellet with 70% ethanol, the RNA was dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and an equal volume of 8m lithium chloride was added. The solution was placed at −20 °C for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min to remove large RNA. To the supernatant, containing preQ1-tRNATyr, was added an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol, and the solution cooled at −20 °C for 2 h. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min, washed with 70% ethanol, and dissolved in 3 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.3). The concentration of tRNA was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using ε260 = 15 units/mg/ml. Approximately 25% of the total tRNA was determined to be preQ1-tRNATyr by tRNA-tyrosine synthetase activity assays (53Nishimura S. Harada F. Narushima U. Seno T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 142: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Crude tRNA was initially fractionated by chromatography on benzoylated-napthoylated DEAE-cellulose according to Gillam et al. (54Gillam I.C. Tener G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 20: 55-70Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The preQ1-tRNATyr-containing fractions, identified by QueA and tRNA-tyrosine synthetase activity assays, were pooled, and the tRNA was precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol and cooling. The tRNA precipitate was washed twice with 70% ethanol and dialyzed against 10 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 m NaCl. The enriched preQ1-tRNATyr was further purified by chromatography on NACSTM resin according to Thompson et al. (55Thompson J.A. Blakesley R.W. Doran K. Hough C.J. Wells R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 100: 368-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The preQ1-tRNATyr-containing fractions were pooled, and the tRNA was precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol and cooling. After washing with 70% ethanol, the purified preQ1-tRNATyr was dissolved in 3 mmcitrate (pH 6.3). To remove bound metal ions from the preQ1-tRNATyr, EDTA was added to a concentration of 5 mm, and the solution was dialyzed at 80 °C for 10 min against 3000 volumes of 3 mm sodium citrate (pH 6.3), followed by dialysis at 6 °C over 5 h with two buffer changes. The preQ1-tRNATyr was then precipitated by the addition of isopropyl alcohol and cooling. After washing with 70% ethanol, the purified preQ1-tRNATyr was dissolved in 3 mmcitrate, pH 6.3. The concentration of preQ1-tRNATyr was determined by UV-visible spectroscopy using ε260 = 816,000m−1 cm−1 (determined on the World Wide Web at paris.chem.yale.edu/extinct.html).

Structural analysis of this protein from Haemophilus influenzaeidentified four amino acids that ligand the bound iron: His9, Glu57, Tyr195, and Tyr196. A phosphate provides an additional ligand, and the presence of a water molecule is required to complete the octahedral geometry for stable iron binding. We report the 1.14-Å resolution crystal structure of the iron-loaded form of the H. influenzae periplasmic ferric ion binding protein (FbpA) mutant H9Q. This protein was produced in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and, after purification and conversion to the apo form, was iron-loaded. H9Q is able to bind ferric iron in an open conformation. A surprising finding in the present high resolution structure is the presence of EDTA located at the previously determined anion ternary binding site, where phosphate is located in the wild type holo and apo structures. EDTA contributes four of the six coordinating ligands for iron, with two Tyr residues, 195 and 196, completing the coordination. This is the first example of a metal binding protein with a bound metal·EDTA complex. The results suggest that FbpA may have the ability to bind and transport iron bound to biological chelators, in addition to bare ferric iron.

The results suggest that FbpA may have the ability to bind and transport iron bound to biological chelators, in addition to bare ferric iron. transferrin lactoferrin ferric ion binding proteins A and B transferrin binding proteins A and B periplasmic ligand binding protein polyethylene glycol Iron plays a key role in many essential biological processes (1Weinberg E.D. Weinberg G.A. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 8: 164-169Google Scholar). Therefore, the acquisition of iron is integral for the survival of almost all organisms. Due to the low solubility of free ferric iron (Fe3+) under physiological conditions, a variety of specialized systems for uptake, transport, and storage of this metal ion cofactor have been developed by living organisms (2Braun V. Killmann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 104-109Google Scholar). The majority of the iron obtained through the dietary intake in humans is stored and utilized in the intracellular compartment (3Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Google Scholar). Extracellular iron is complexed by the bi-lobed transport glycoprotein, transferrin (Tf),1 within the body or by lactoferrin (Lf) on mucosal surfaces (4Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Google Scholar). These iron binding glycoproteins are produced in excess of free iron and bind iron at extremely high affinities (K d = 1 × 10−21m), effectively reducing the availability of this element, and thus protecting against bacterial infection (5Griffiths E. Chart H. Stevenson P. Roth J.A. Virulence Mechanisms of Bacterial Pathogens. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1988: 121-135Google Scholar, 6Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-363Google Scholar). The ability of a pathogen to colonize and grow within the host is essential for the initiation of an infection (7Wooldridge K.G. Williams P.H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 12: 325-348Google Scholar). Thus to cause disease the pathogen must be successful in competing for protein bound iron in the host. In bacterial pathogens the expression of genes encoding iron acquisition proteins results from an adaptation to the iron-limiting environment within the host (8Clarke T.C. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 7-30Google Scholar). Bacteria have diverse and elaborate systems capable of scavenging iron from host proteins. Some pathogenic microorganisms are able to synthesize and secrete low molecular mass (500–1000 Da) organic iron chelators termed siderophores, which are able to bind iron with association constants as high as 1053 (3Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Google Scholar, 9Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Google Scholar). This mechanism of iron acquisition is effective for a variety of different iron sources and environments and is typically found in bacteria that are present in a variety of different ecological niches. Iron is transported into the bacterial cell in the form of an iron chelate by this mechanism (9Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Google Scholar). Another strategy is chelate-independent and employs an array of distinct outer membrane receptors, which specifically interact with the different host iron binding proteins. This mechanism is utilized by pathogenic bacteria of the Neisseriaceae (e.g. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis) and Pasteurellaceae (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae) families, which are not capable of producing siderophores (10West S.E.H. Sparling P.F. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 388-394Google Scholar, 11Ogunnariwo J.A. Cheng C.Y. Ford J.A. Schryvers A.B. Microb. Pathog. 1990; 9: 397-406Google Scholar). These microorganisms produce Tf and Lf surface receptors that are capable of binding the iron-loaded host proteins as the first step in this elaborate iron acquisition system (12Gray-Owen S.D. Schryvers A.B. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 185-191Google Scholar). The heterodimeric receptor complex typified by the Tf receptor is composed of two proteins, transferrin binding proteins A and B (TbpA and TbpB, respectively). Even though the binding of iron-containing proteins to the bacterial surface receptors is well characterized, the subsequent steps of iron removal and transport into the bacterial cell are not well understood. The removal of iron from Tf and the subsequent transport of free iron across the outer membrane requires energy provided by TonB and its associated proteins, ExbB and ExbD (13Stojiljkovic I. Srinivasan N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 805-812Google Scholar). Once the iron is removed from Tf, and transported across the outer membrane, it is bound by the periplasmic ferric ion binding protein (FbpA) (14Taboy C.H. Vaughan K.G. Mietzner T.A. Aisen P. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2719-2724Google Scholar). The continued transport of Fe3+ from FbpA across the cytoplasmic membrane requires the genetically linked hydrophobic membrane protein, FbpB and the cytoplasmic membrane-associated nucleotide binding protein, FbpC, which together form a Fe3+ ATP-binding cassette transporter (15Sebastian S. Genco C.A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 3141-3145Google Scholar). Once inside the cytoplasm ferric iron is able to bind iron-coordinating proteins required for growth or be stored in the form of bacterioferritin (16Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Google Scholar). A series of site-directed mutants of FbpA were prepared to evaluate the role of the various amino acid side chains in metal binding and their importance for the iron acquisition process. In this study, we report the 1.1-Å nominal resolution and 1.14-Å actual resolution (where the last shell is >50% complete) crystal structure of a holo H. influenzae site-directed mutant (H9Q) FbpA in complex with EDTA. With EDTA bound at the previously described anion-binding site, FbpA adopts an open conformation. Characteristics of the residues involved in EDTA binding show how FbpA may be able to accommodate a broad range of anion ligands. The EDTA molecule is able to fulfill the octahedral requirements of Fe3+ by contributing four of the required six ligands. This is the first example of a metal binding protein, which binds a metal·EDTA complex. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pLysS harboring the pT7-7 plasmid encoding FbpA with the His9 to Gln mutation (H9Q) was used to express the H. influenzae mutant protein in the periplasm under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The protein was then purified using a modified osmotic shock procedure. Briefly, the broth culture was harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min using a GSA rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and each pellet was resuspended in 1/10 volume (50 ml) of buffer composed of: 30 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA. The solution was rocked for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min using a GSA rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was again discarded, and the bottles were inverted onto paper towels briefly to remove all traces of supernatant. The pellets were rapidly resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold 5 mm MgSO4 by pipetting up and down with a 1-ml pipette. The solutions were left on ice for 20 min. After which time the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min using a GSA rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was carefully removed, without disrupting the pellet, because the supernatant contains the periplasmic osmotic shock fraction. Finally, the sample was extensively dialyzed against 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C. Following dialysis, the protein sample was subjected to cation exchange chromatography on the Bio-Cad high-performance liquid chromatography system as a final purification step. The column was washed with 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, to remove unbound proteins and eluted with a gradient of 0–1.5m NaCl. The material collected from the column was concentrated to a final volume of between 1–3 ml using a Centricon 10 microconcentrator. The removal of iron from the protein was then accomplished by treatment of the protein in the Centricon 10 microconcentrator with 1 mm EDTA and a 4000-fold molar excess of citrate (sodium salt, pH 7.5) and incubation on ice for 20 min. At this point the protein, still in the Centricon, was exhaustively exchanged into 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Once completed, 5 mm phosphate was added to the Centricon, and the sample was again incubated on ice for 20 min. After the incubation period, it was again washed extensively with 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. Finally, the sample was concentrated to ∼25 mg/ml and iron was loaded. Iron-saturated FbpA was prepared by adding a 5-fold molar excess of a ferric citrate solution. A fresh ferric citrate solution was prepared by dissolving ferric chloride (FeCl3·6H2O, Sigma) in 100 mm sodium citrate/100 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer. The protein and ferric citrate solution was then placed at 4 °C overnight before being used for crystallization or being frozen for later use. The resulting preparations were deemed pure based on SDS-PAGE analysis. All proteins were stored at −80 °C until they were used for crystallography. The sitting-drop vapor diffusion method was employed for crystallization of the protein. All crystallization experiments were conducted at 20 °C with 4-μl drops containing Fe-FbpA, 10% (w/v) PEG 5000, and 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer solution at pH 8.2. The drops were equilibrated against a 1-ml reservoir containing 20% PEG 5000 and 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.2. Large, pink crystals of the protein grew within 1 week. These crystals were suitable for x-ray diffraction and belonged to the orthorhombic space group P21212 (a = 105.1 Å,b = 75.3 Å, c = 33.6 Å). The crystals in a sitting drop were harvested by scooping them with a nylon loop. The crystal was then dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.2, and 20% (w/v) PEG 5000 for ∼30 s before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected from a frozen crystal of the H9Q FbpA·EDTA·Fe complex up to 1.1 Å at 100 K using a QUANTUM4 charge-coupled device camera on Beamline 5.03 at the Advanced Light Source Berkeley Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, using a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The data were reduced and scaled using the HKL2000 software (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 267: 307-326Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using the program Molrep from the CCP4 suite of programs (18Collaborative Computational Project No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The coordinates of theH. influenzae wild type apoFbpA (open conformation) were used as the search model. Iterative cycles of interactive manual refitting of the model using the program XtalView/xfit made use of maps created with ARP/wARP 5.2 and refinement with Refmac5 was carried out to complete and correct the model. During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (F o − F c maps) were used to place the bound EDTA·iron complex. Restrained refinement using a maximum likelihood target function and anisotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out. During the final refinement stage, well-defined residual electron density peaks in difference maps were assigned to water molecules. The last residue of the C terminus was not visible in the electron density map, so it was omitted. Several side chains of surface-exposed residues are also missing (residues 10, 11, 27, 43, 93, 119, 244, and 282) and were built as alanines. The final crystallographic R-factor is 0.158 for all data from 105.4- to 1.1-Å resolution. The free R-factor for randomly selected 5% data is 0.180. The overall structure obtained for the mutant FbpA is similar to the previously reported metal-loaded and apoFbpA structures. The refined coordinates of H. influenzaeH9Q FbpA in complex with EDTA·Fe have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank. Ramachandran plots of the mutant structure shows the satisfactory location of all residues into allowed regions of conformational space. The DALI server (www2.ebi.ac.uk/dali) was utilized to find structurally similar proteins in the Fold Classification Based on Structure-Structure Alignment of Proteins data base (19Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Google Scholar). The recombinant H9Q FbpA mutant protein was isolated from the periplasm of E. coli and purified by ion-exchange chromatography. Following conversion to the apo form, the protein was exhaustively exchanged into a 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The production of an apo form allowed for the possibility of various metals to be added to the sample to determine binding affinities for the mutant protein (results not shown). A portion of the concentrated apo sample was iron-loaded with a 5-fold molar excess of ferric ions dissolved in a citrate/bicarbonate buffer for crystallization. Crystals grew within 1 week using the sitting drop method with 4-μl drops and a 1-ml reservoir of 20% PEG 5000 and 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.2, at 20 °C. H9Q FbpA has the same overall topology as the apo form of wild type FbpA, with approximate dimensions of 60 Å × 30 Å × 40 Å (Fig. 1). The mutant protein, like the wild type FbpA is composed of two structural domains, termed the N and C domains. Each domain is composed of a twisted five-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices (Fig.2). The two domains are connected by two antiparallel β-strands, which form the hinge between the two domains. Hinge bending between the two domains enables the participation of both domains in the binding and sequestering of the EDTA·Fe ligand.Figure 2Overall structure of H9Q FbpA complexed with EDTA·Fe. A stereo ribbon diagram showing the overall tertiary structure and secondary structure elements in the complex. The EDTA molecule and iron atom are black. Helices, β-strands, and random coil regions are gray. This figure was produced using XtalView/Xfit (34McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar) and ViewerLite 5.0. The N and C termini are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison of the H9Q FbpA crystal structure with that of the H. influenzae wild type FbpA structures reveals that the mutant protein is able to bind iron in an open conformation (Fig. 1). The Cα trace shows that the mutant protein form is highly similar to the apo wild type form. The root mean square deviation for 308 Cα atoms is only 0.50 Å, whereas the root mean square deviation for the same 308 Cα atoms of the apo and holo structures is 5.55 and 5.76 Å when the mutant and wild type holo forms are compared. The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table I) and the final electron density maps and Ramachandran plot (20Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Google Scholar) (not shown) of the main chain torsion angles as defined by the program PROCHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thorton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) indicate that the crystal structure of H9Q is of high quality. In the Ramachandran plot 94.2% of the non-glycine residues are in the most favored regions and 5.8% are in additional allowed regions. This structure represents the first example of a metal binding protein with a bound metal·EDTA complex. Electron density maps showing the bound EDTA molecule and iron atom are displayed in Fig.3. The high resolution electron density maps (2 F o − F c αc and F o − F c αc) resolving individual atoms allowed for the unambiguous placement of the EDTA molecule at the binding site. Other anions were considered based on buffers used during the purification and crystallization protocols, but they were later rejected due to their lack of agreement with the electron density maps. A diagram of the EDTA·Fe binding site is displayed in Fig.4. In this H9Q FbpA structure, the iron binding residues of the C-terminal domain (Tyr195 and Tyr196) adopt essentially identical placements and conformations with respect to the iron atom as those in the wild type holoFbpA structure (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). However, the iron binding residues of the N-terminal domain (Gln9 and Glu57) adopt similar conformations to the wild type apoFbpA (23Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Nowalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Google Scholar). These residues have rotated away from their iron binding locations and are hydrogen-bonded to residues within their N-terminal domain across the groove from the iron atom. The distances of Glu57-Oε1 and Gln9-Oε1 from iron are 9.19 and 6.05 Å, respectively. Filling the role of these two residues in the coordination of iron is a bound EDTA molecule. Because the EDTA is a rather large molecule, containing two nitrogen atoms and four carboxyl groups, it is also able to fulfill the roles of the phosphate anion and the water molecule that are found in the holoFbpA structure (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). The EDTA wraps around the iron atom, and one of the carboxyl groups is able to bind in the previously described ternary anion-binding site. As illustrated in Fig.4, the EDTA provides four of the six coordinating ligands to iron binding. Thus, four oxygen donors and two nitrogen ligands still octahedrally coordinate the bound Fe3+. The ligands include Tyr195-OH, Tyr196-OH, two EDTA oxygen atoms (O14 and O19), and the last two sites may be weakly coordinated by EDTA nitrogen atoms (N3 and N8) or almost empty, because the distances of these ligands from the iron are slightly longer (2.88 and 2.52 Å, respectively) when compared with the other coordination distances and distances previously reported for EDTA nitrogen atoms to Fe3+. The iron coordination is distorted from perfect octahedral geometry, with distances ranging from 1.92 to 2.88 Å from iron to the coordinating ligands (Table II).Table IIGeometry of the iron binding siteBond lengths (Å)Fe-OH (Tyr195)1.92Fe-OH (Tyr196)2.01Fe-N3 (EDTA)2.88Fe-N8 (EDTA)2.52Fe-O19 (EDTA)1.95Fe-O14 (EDTA)2.05Bond angle (°)OH (Tyr195)-Fe-OH (Tyr196)109.19OH (Tyr195)-Fe-N3 (EDTA)149.67OH (Tyr195)-Fe-N8 (EDTA)89.95OH (Tyr195)-Fe-O19 (EDTA)89.29OH (Tyr195)-Fe-O14 (EDTA)99.98OH (Tyr196)-Fe-N3 (EDTA)99.70OH (Tyr196)-Fe-N8 (EDTA)154.58OH (Tyr196)-Fe-O19 (EDTA)109.19OH (Tyr196)-Fe-O14 (EDTA)78.65N3 (EDTA)-Fe-N8 (EDTA)76.00N3 (EDTA)-Fe-O19 (EDTA)64.91N3 (EDTA)-Fe-O14 (EDTA)103.09N8 (EDTA)-Fe-O19 (EDTA)91.89N8 (EDTA)-Fe-O14 (EDTA)78.03O19 (EDTA)-Fe-O14 (EDTA)166.20 Open table in a new tab Previous small molecule crystallography on an EDTA·Fe complex revealed similar ligation geometry to that observed in the H9Q structure (24Solans X. Font Altaba M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1984; 40: 635-638Google Scholar). The oxygen atoms in the small molecule structure that represent Tyr195-OH and Tyr196-OH in the H9Q structure have ligation distances of 1.98 and 2.10 Å, respectively. Also the oxygen atoms of EDTA in the small molecule structure that correspond to the coordinating EDTA oxygens (O14 and O19) in the H9Q FbpA have ligation distances of 2.10 and 1.97 Å, respectively. Although the above distances for oxygen atoms are very similar to those reported in Table II, the distances to the liganding nitrogen atoms in the H9Q structure are slightly longer than the previously reported distances of 2.32 and 2.32 Å for the same residues in the small molecule complex. The bond angles in the small molecule complex range from 71.8° to 106.0° (24Solans X. Font Altaba M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. C Cryst. Struct. Commun. 1984; 40: 635-638Google Scholar). In H9Q the angles involving the nitrogen atoms deviate slightly from this range adding to the speculation that these residues may be coordinating the Fe3+ very weakly. The EDTA molecule is well ordered with an average temperature factor of 17 Å2. The binding of EDTA is stabilized by the location of one of the carboxyl groups in the previously determined anion-binding site. This carboxyl group is held in place by a similar constellation of residues as are shown to bind phosphate in the wild type apo and holo forms. The residues that contribute hydrogen bonds to this carboxyl group of EDTA include Asn175, Asn193, Ser139, and Tyr195. With a putative hydrogen bond also forming between the backbone nitrogen atom of Ala141 and the carboxyl group of EDTA. The other carboxyl group involved in the coordination of the iron interacts with the protein though hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg262. These data suggest that there is a high degree of promiscuity in anion binding by FbpA and that FbpA is likely able to bind iron complexed with a wide range of chelators. Analysis of the H9Q FbpA structure reveals that it adopts the typical periplasmic ligand binding protein (PLBP) fold that has been observed for almost all structurally determined PLBPs to date. Although PLBPs recognize a large variety of ligands and have very little sequence homology, almost all PLBP structures known to date are composed of two globular domains with the binding site located in a groove between these domains. The domains are connected by a number of flexible β-strands at the bottom of the ligand-binding site (25Quiocho F.A. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Biol. Sci. 1990; 326: 341-351Google Scholar, 26Quiocho F.A. Ledvina P.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 17-25Google Scholar). Even though FbpA possesses the typical PLBP structure, none of the other closely related periplasmic transport proteins bind naked metal atoms (27Tam R. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 320-346Google Scholar). A search using the DALI (19Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Google Scholar) server for proteins in the Protein Data Bank with similar three-dimensional folds to FbpA reveals structural similarity with sulfate binding protein, maltodextrin binding protein, spermidine binding protein, phosphate binding protein, and the N-terminal half-molecule of ovotransferrin. Due to the striking structural similarity between transferrin and many periplasmic binding proteins, these proteins have been included in the transferrin structural superfamily (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). This group of proteins includes the eukaryotic transferrins, lactoferrins, and the bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, which transport a diverse group of ligands in the periplasmic space of bacteria. Despite operating in different organisms and cellular locations, human Tf and the H. influenzae FbpA appear to be structurally and functionally homologous (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). FbpA shares many structural similarities with each lobe of Tf, including two globular domains, each centered on a twisted mixed β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. In each protein a “hinge,” which is composed of antiparallel β-strands, connects the two domains. Moreover, the coordination of the Fe3+ by the oxygens of two tyrosines, an imidazole nitrogen from histidine and a carboxylate oxygen from an acidic residue (Asp in Tf and Glu in FbpA), is identical (28Nowalk A.J. Tencza S.B. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12769-12775Google Scholar). However, there are also some important structural differences between Tfs and FbpA. The first involves how each protein is able to complete the octahedral coordination of Fe3+. Transferrin utilizes two oxygens from a carbonate anion, whereas FbpA makes use of an oxygen from a phosphate and another from a water molecule (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). Although the subset of amino acids coordinating the iron atom is very similar, the residues arise from different regions of the individual proteins. The iron-binding site is also more solvent-exposed in FbpA than it is in transferrin. The discrepancy in iron exposure is due to the binding site being shallower in FbpA and the absence of an additional loop covering the binding site in Tf. Previous x-ray crystallographic analyses have illustrated that for those proteins of the transferrin structural superfamily for which both the apo and holo forms have been solved, the two domains rotate toward each other in the liganded structure (closed conformation) (8Clarke T.C. Tari L.W. Vogel H.J. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 7-30Google Scholar). The apo form of FbpA has the same overall topology as the holo form, however, the two domains of the protein are rotated about 20° with respect to each other (Fig. 1). A change in the dihedral angles of the antiparallel β-strands in the joining hinge region opens the binding site to the solvent. Our initial intent was to determine the role of the metal-liganding residue His9 in the coordination of iron in the H. influenzae FbpA. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the histidine residue to a glutamine amino acid. In a companion study, the resulting mutant protein was tested for its metal-binding properties and ability to support transport of iron from transferrin. 2A. G. Khan, S. R. Shouldice, R. Yu, and A. B. Schryvers, manuscript in preparation. As revealed by the present crystal structure the H9Q mutation has not affected the protein folding of FbpA (Fig. 1). However, the most interesting information gleaned from the H9Q structure is the protein's ability to bind iron in an open conformation with the use of an EDTA molecule. The presence of a bound EDTA molecule was very surprising given that EDTA was added only to convert the FbpA into an apo form and was not present in any subsequent solutions. This high resolution structure provides valuable information for the structural pathway illustrating the conformational transition from the open to closed forms upon iron binding. The FbpA is fully iron-loaded, with the ordered iron-binding site of the C-domain occupied; yet the protein remains in an open conformation most likely due to the location of the EDTA molecule in the binding cleft. A similar structural state was reported for transferrin when crystallized with ferric nitrilotriacetic acid (29Mizutani K. Yamashita H. Kurokawa H. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10190-10194Google Scholar). Due to the fact that this FbpA·iron·EDTA complex formed in solution prior to crystallization, because EDTA and iron were absent from the crystallization conditions, two models can be proposed. In the first model, EDTA binds in a mode that was first proposed for phosphate, based on the apo and holo structural information (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar, 23Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Nowalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Google Scholar). The EDTA molecule would likely be sequestered in the anion-binding site and close over the top of the iron once Fe3+ bound to the tyrosines. The other carboxylate group that is ultimately involved in iron coordination would likely have to remain free in this model until the Fe3+ is bound in order for the iron to have access to the tyrosines. This model is supported by the fact that during sample preparation the protein was washed extensively with buffer after which a large excess of phosphate was added to the sample, which was subsequently washed repeatedly with buffer again. The lack of phosphate in the present structure suggests that EDTA may have occupied the anion-binding site when phosphate was added to the solution and the favorable hydrogen bonds maintained the EDTA in position even during the buffer exchange protocol. The second model assumes that the iron binds to the protein followed by the EDTA anion. In this model EDTA, either free in solution or associated with the protein at some other location, initially binds free ferric iron and then moves to the highly ordered iron-binding site involving the tyrosine residues (Tyr195 and Tyr196) of the C domain or wraps over the top of the Fe3+ after the iron has bound to the tyrosine residues. Due to the steps involved during the sample preparation, the metal·EDTA complex would likely have to displace phosphate at the anion-binding site in this scenario. Regardless of the order involved, the present high resolution structure illustrates the point that ferric iron initially associates with the ordered tyrosine residues (Tyr195 and Tyr196) of the C domain. The two domains would then rotate together as the histidine and glutamic acid residues are able to complete the coordination of free ferric iron in the wild type protein (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar). The H9Q structure reveals how FbpA may be able to accommodate other metal· anion complexes. A very important observation obtained from the H9Q structure with EDTA is the ability of a carboxyl group to occupy the anion-binding site. This was surprising, because the protein was also exposed to phosphate prior to the iron loading process. Previously it had been shown that a phosphate molecule was located at this ternary binding site (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar, 23Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Nowalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Google Scholar). The carboxyl group of EDTA found at the anion binding site forms hydrogen bonds with many of the same amino acids the phosphate anion was shown to bond to (Fig. 4). In the wild type holo form, PO43− forms hydrogen bonds with Try195-OH, Asn193-Nδ2, Asn175-Nδ2, Ser139-Oγ, Ala141-N, and Gln58-Oε1. With the exception of Gln58-Oε1, all of these moieties are hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate group that occupies the anion-binding site. The other carboxylate group that is involved in the iron coordination is stabilized by hydrogen bonds to the protein residue Arg262. The remaining two carboxylate groups of the EDTA molecule point out of the binding cleft and are hydrogen-bonded to water molecules. These groups of the EDTA molecule do not interact with protein residues in any way. The observation of a carboxylate group occupying the anion-binding site rather than the previously determined phosphate is consistent with functional studies that demonstrated that a number of oxyanions can fill the role of the ternary anion (23Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Nowalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Google Scholar, 30Guo M. Harvey I. Yang W. Coghill L. Campopiano D.J. Parkinson J.A. MacGillivray R.T.A. Harris W.R. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 2490-2502Google Scholar). Other groups have also discussed the ability of H. influenzae to grow in the presence of a number of iron chelates, with the present study providing an explanation as to how transport of these iron complexes may occur (31Williams P. Morton D.J. Towner K.J. Stevenson P. Griffiths E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2343-2350Google Scholar). This structure reveals how FbpA is able to not only bind free ferric iron but how it may be able to accept a variety of anions under physiological conditions. It appears that the mutation of His9 to Gln has very little effect on the present structure. The Gln residue adopts a very similar conformation to that of His in the apo wild type structure. The Gln residue rotates away from the iron binding site and hydrogen bonds with other residues present in the N-terminal domain. The glutamine is located across the cleft 6.05 Å away from the iron atom. Obviously, the Gln residue is unable to bind iron in the presence of EDTA due to steric hindrance. However, there seems to be no structural reason a Gln side chain could not coordinate to iron, as in theory it could coordinate iron through its amide oxygen. Primary sequence alignment of FbpA sequences from H. influenzae and Pasteurella hemolytica reveal that the histidine residue is replaced by a glutamine in the P. hemolytica protein. In fact, the crystal structure of the same histidine to glutamine mutation has been determined for the N-lobe of transferrin showing that this mutation is still able to octahedrally coordinate iron (32Baker H.M. Mason A.B. He Q.Y. MacGillivray R.T. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11670-11675Google Scholar). However, it must be noted that the H249Q Tf structure may exist in the closed state, due to the increased number of interdomain interactions present in Tf that do not exist in the FbpA, because of to its more solvent-exposed cleft. Even though the H249Q transferrin protein is still able to coordinate iron in a closed conformation, spectroscopic studies have described altered properties, both in the acid stability of iron binding and the kinetics of iron release to chelators indicating a reduced affinity for iron (33He Q.Y. Mason A.B. Pakdaman R. Chasteen N.D. Dixon B.K. Tam B.M. Nguyen V. MacGillivray R.T.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1205-1210Google Scholar). Thus, no conclusions can be reached at this point as to whether the H9Q FbpA would be a functional protein in the bacterium. In conclusion, we have determined the first high resolution crystal structure of a metal binding protein, which binds a metal·EDTA complex. The previous crystallographic structures of FbpAs have been restricted essentially to the two structural forms: the first is the apo or open form, and the other is the holo or closed form (22Bruns C.M. Norwalk A.J. Avrai A.S. McTigue M.A. Vaughan K.A. Mietzner T.A. McRee D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 919-924Google Scholar, 23Bruns C.M. Anderson D.S. Vaughan K.G. Williams P.A. Nowalk A.J. McRee D.E. Mietzner T.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15631-15637Google Scholar). As an alternate structural state, the current EDTA·Fe3+structure is the first demonstration of an iron-loaded, open FbpA form. The high resolution structure allows for three important observations. First, only the two tyrosine residues (Tyr195 and Tyr196) participate as protein ligands in the coordination of the iron atom. This observation provides evidence as to the entry of iron into the apo protein. Second, the presence of the carboxyl group stably bound in the anion-binding site instead of a phosphate anion, supports the idea of FbpA being able to use other available anions from the periplasmic space to coordinate iron. Finally, there is the observation of the ability of FbpA to bind a large molecule (EDTA) in the relatively shallow binding groove. The final observation proposes many more questions than answers. At this point in time we are unable to comment fully as to the significance of such a finding. Does this mean that wild type FbpA is able to accept and transport other iron complexes rather than just free ferric iron? Obviously, future studies on the H9Q and wild type proteins will have to explore this possibility. With such a shallow binding pocket compared with the transferrins, it is not unreasonable to speculate that FbpA may be able to bind biological iron chelate complexes, such as ferric citrate for transport into the bacterial cell. From the present study it is apparent that FbpA can accommodate much larger anions than phosphate. We are indebted to Syrrx, Inc. for allowing the use of laboratory space and beam time toward the completion of this project."

Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12109-12119Google Scholar), the standard reaction mixture (10 ॖl) contained (unless otherwise indicated) 10 ॖm[14C]B (∼500 cpm/tube), 0.5–1.0 mg/ml membrane protein, 0.17 Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MES1 buffer, pH 6.5. The reactions were incubated under aerobic conditions at 30 °C and terminated at the indicated times by spotting 4- or 5-ॖl samples onto a 20 × 20-cm silica gel TLC plate. The spots were dried for 30 min with a cold air stream, and the plate was then developed in the solvent CHCl3, MeOH, H2O, pyridine (40:25:4:2, v/v). The remaining substrate and product(s) were detected with a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software. Enzyme specific activity (usually expressed as nmol/min/mg) was calculated based on the percentage of conversion of substrate to product(s). For demonstrating oxygen dependence, an assay system consisting of 25 ॖm[14C]B, 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, 0.17 Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pQN235 membranes was set up in an anaerobic chamber. The reactions were started by the addition of membranes as the enzyme source after equilibration of all tubes in the absence of oxygen for ∼30 min. To remove traces of oxygen, glucose oxidase (20 ॖg/ml), catalase (2 ॖg/ml), and glucose (0.17) were included in some cases, as indicated. After 30, 60, or 90 min, portions of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto a silica gel TLC plate, which was developed as described above. A parallel set of reaction mixtures was assayed simultaneously under ambient aerobic conditions. A genomic DNA library of the R. leguminosarumstrain 3841 was obtained from Dr. J. Downie of the John Innes Institute (Norwich, UK). This library was constructed by the ligation of ∼20–25-kb fragments of genomic DNA (24Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Google Scholar), generated by partialEcoRI digestion, into the cosmid pLAFR-1 (25Friedman A.M. Long S.R. Brown S.E. Buikema W.J. Ausubel F.M. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 18: 289-296Google Scholar). E. coli 803 was employed as the host strain (26Wood W. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Google Scholar). The library was transferred from E. coli 803 into R. etli CE3 by tri-parental mating (27Glazebrook J. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 398-418Google Scholar, 28Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Google Scholar) with E. coliMT616 as the helper (28Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Google Scholar). Three thousand individual R. etliCE3 colonies harboring random fragments of the library were picked into microtiter dishes containing (per well) 150 ॖl of TY medium with 20 ॖg/ml nalidixic acid, 200 ॖg/ml streptomycin, 12 ॖg/ml tetracycline, and 10 mm CaCl2 and then were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm to stationary phase. The cultures were stored at −80 °C as master stocks in the same dishes after adjusting the medium to 207 glycerol by addition of an appropriate volume of 607 glycerol. To prepare fresh lysates for screening purposes, 1800 colonies were taken out of storage and regrown in 96-well microtiter plates. Each well was inoculated with a 5-ॖl portion of the master glycerol stock culture into 150 ॖl of TY broth supplemented with 10 mm CaCl2, 20 ॖg/ml nalidixic acid, 200 ॖg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 12 ॖg/ml tetracycline. The microtiter plates were then shaken at 225 rpm in a 30 °C incubator for ∼24 h or until the OD550reached ∼ 0.6, as measured with a microtiter plate reader. (Back-up glycerol stocks of these master plates were made by transferring 50 ॖl from each well into a new microtiter plate, in which each well contained 25 ॖl of 607 glycerol. The new stocks were stored at −80 °C.) The remaining 100 ॖl in each well of the microtiter plate was centrifuged at 3,660 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with 50 ॖl of 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and centrifuged as above. After decanting the supernatant, the cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ॖl of lysis buffer, which consists of 100 mg/ml lysozyme in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5. The plates were sealed, and the contents were vigorously mixed for a minute. Lysis was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min. The lysates were frozen by placing the plate into a −80 °C freezer for several hours, after which they were thawed. Each 96-well microtiter plate contained eight rows (rows A–H) of 12 wells (wells 1–12). To facilitate the screening, each row was further grouped into four pools of three lysates. Row A, for example, was grouped into pools A(1–3), A(4–6), A(7–9), and A(10–12). The pooled lysates were assayed for their ability to convert [14C]B to [14C]D-1. A portion of each pool (9 ॖl) was mixed with 2 ॖl of a concentrated reaction buffer (consisting of 5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 0.57 Triton X-100) and 0.5 ॖl of 0.05 ॖm[14C]B (∼600 cpm/reaction tube). After 30 and 60 min of incubation at 30 °C, 5-ॖl portions of each reaction mixture were spotted onto a 20 × 20-cm silica TLC plate. Negative (no enzyme) and positive (wild type R. leguminosarum 3855 membranes) controls were included for each 96-well microtiter plate of pooled lysates that were screened. The amount of [14C]D-1 formed in each reaction tube was quantified with a PhosphorImager. Three apparently positive pools of lysates were identified and subjected to further analysis. Membranes from each of the nine cosmid-bearing strains contributing to the three positive pools were prepared and assayed individually for overproduction of oxidase activity versus membranes of the control CE3 strain. Next, the hybrid cosmids of the three strains that directed overexpression of oxidase activity were isolated, transformed into E. coliHB101, and then transferred into S. meliloti via tri-parental mating (27Glazebrook J. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 398-418Google Scholar, 28Finan T.M. Kunkel B. De Vos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Google Scholar). Finally, membranes of S. meliloti cells harboring these cosmids were assayed for their ability to express oxidase activity to verify the presence of the lipid A oxidase gene on the cosmid inserts. Membranes of the S. meliloti 1021 host strain (22Galibert F. Finan T.M. Long S.R. Puhler A. Abola P. Ampe F. Barloy-Hubler F. Barnett M.J. Becker A. Boistard P. Bothe G. Boutry M. Bowser L.

Protocols for handling of DNA samples were those of Sambrook et al. (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Competent cells of E. coli were prepared by the CaCl2 method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar, 30Bergmans H.E. van Die I.M. Hoekstra W.P. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 564-570Google Scholar). Cosmids and plasmids were purified using Qiagen DNA purification kits. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed with an ABI Prism 377 instrument at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility. Primers were purchased from Invitrogen. DNA sequence analysis and searches for open reading frames were performed with GCG and ORF Finder (31Wheeler D.L. Church D.M. Federhen S. Lash A.E. Madden T.L. Pontius J.U. Schuler G.D. Schriml L.M. Sequeira E. Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 28-33Google Scholar). Digestion of the cosmid p1S11D with HindIII generated fragments of ∼0.2, 1.2, 3.5, 4, and 6.5 kb, as well as a large band (∼21 kb) corresponding to the vector pLAFR-1. The insert-derived fragments were ligated into the shuttle vector pRK404a digested with HindIII (32Ditta G. Stanfield S. Corbin D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7347-7351Google Scholar), and the desired constructs were transferred into S. meliloti via tri-parental mating. Membranes of S. meliloti cells harboring each of these subclones were prepared and assayed for oxidase activity. Only one hybrid plasmid, pQN210, which contains the 6.5-kb HindIII fragment of p1S11D, directed the expression of oxidase activity. The same 6.5-kb fragment was also present in the DNA insert of p1U12G and was active when expressed on the hybrid plasmid pQN217 (Table I). The 6.5-kb HindIII fragment of pQN210 was sequenced using a primer walking strategy (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The DNA sequencing was facilitated by subcloning of several EcoRI fragments derived from the 6.5-kb insert present in pQN210 into the vector pRK404a. None of these subclones directed the expression of oxidase activity, given that anEcoRI site is present in the oxidase structural genelpxQ (see below). The lpxQ gene was cloned into several vectors, which were tested for their ability to direct the overexpression of oxidase activity. The coding region oflpxQ was amplified by PCR from pQN210 with various primers to optimize restriction enzyme sites, translational start sites, or translational stop sites. For all of the primers, restriction enzyme sites are italicized, and a G/C clamp is incorporated at their 5′-ends. The 5′-lpxQ/1 primer (5′-CGCGCAAGCTTAGGAGGAATTTAAAATGACATATGCGCTGCGTTCTTCCG-3′) was designed for ligation of lpxQ into lacpromoter-driven vectors, such as the shuttle vector pRK404a. This primer also incorporates a HindIII site (in italics), a ribosome-binding site (underlined sequence), and a translational spacer element between the ribosome-binding site and the ATG start codon (33MacFerrin K.D. Terranova M.P. Schreiber S.L. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1937-1941Google Scholar). The sequences in bold type correspond to the N-terminal coding region of lpxQ. An internal NdeI site (CATAT9G) (in which the superscript reflects the number of bases from the A of the ATG start codon) is present in the coding sequence of lpxQ. The primer 5′-lpxQ/2 (5′-CGCGCCATATGACATAC9GCGCTGCGTTCTTCCG-3′) was designed to eliminate this internal site and to facilitate the insertion of lpxQ into pET vectors behind the T7lac promoter via an engineered NdeI site (in italics). The internal NdeI site in the coding region oflpxQ was removed by mutating T9 to C9 in 5′-lpxQ/2. This base substitution does not alter the amino acid sequence of LpxQ. Sequences in bold type correspond to the N-terminal coding region of lpxQ. The primer 3′-lpxQ/1 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTTTACACATATTCCCTGACGATAGCAGGC-3′) contains an engineered HindIII site (in italics). The underlined sequence corresponds to a region of DNA that is 96 bases downstream of the termination codon of lpxQ. Lastly, The primer 3′-lpxQ/2 (5′-GCGCAAGCTTCCAGTGGAATGAAACGCCGACGTTGA-3′) was designed for ligation of lpxQ into pET21b+, whereby a protein is made with a His6 tag fused to the C terminus of LpxQ. The sequence in bold type corresponds to the coding region at the C-terminal end of lpxQ less the termination codon. The following combinations of primers were used for PCRs and subsequent ligations. The PCR product of 5′-lpxQ/1 and 3′-lpxQ/1 was digested with HindIII and ligated into the shuttle vector pRK404a to yield pQN231. The lpxQgene amplified with primers 5′-lpxQ/2 and 3′-lpxQ/1 was digested with NdeI andHindIII and then ligated into pET21a+, yielding pQN233. The DNA generated with 5′-lpxQ/2 and 3′-lpxQ/2 was digested with NdeI and HindIII and then ligated into pET21b+, yielding pQN235. A typical PCR mixture contained 100 ng of template DNA (pQN210), 1×Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 107 Me2SO, 17 glycerol, 200 ॖm of each of the dNTPs, 125 ng of each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) in a total volume of 100 ॖl. The reaction was placed in a DNA thermal cycler and subjected to 5 min of denaturation at 94 °C, followed by five cycles consisting of denaturation (1 min, 95 °C), annealing (1 min, 55 °C), and extension (2 min, 72 °C). Full amplification was then achieved with 25 cycles of the following: denaturation (1 min, 95 °C), annealing (1 min, 68 °C), and extension (2 min, 72 °C). After the 30th overall cycle, an additional 6-min extension at 72 °C was performed. The reaction was terminated by cooling the tubes to 4 °C. In each case, the product was analyzed on a 0.87 agarose gel, excised and purified using the Gene Clean II gel DNA purification kit (Bio 101), digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes as indicated above, and ligated into a vector that had been similarly digested. The ligation mixtures that resulted in the construction of pQN233 and pQN235 were first transformed into competentE. coli XL-1Blue cells. The transformants were screened for the desired insert by restriction enzyme digestion. The insert and flanking regions of pQN233 were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The final recombinant plasmids were then transformed, as indicated below, into competent E. coli cells of strain BLR(DE3)/pLysS or Novablue(DE3) (Novagen) to evaluate the overexpression of LpxQ upon induction of mid-log phase cells at 37 °C with 1 mmIPTG. The ligation mixture that yielded pQN231 was first transformed into competent cells of E. coli HB101. The four candidate plasmids containing the proper insert were then moved into S. meliloti 1021 by the tri-parental mating procedure. Of these four hybrid plasmids, only two were found to direct the expression of LpxQ activity and were designated pQN231, presumably reflecting the proper orientation of the lpxQ gene for expression behind thelac promoter. The membranes for assay of these constructs were prepared as described in the accompanying article (1Que-Gewirth N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12109-12119Google Scholar). The A. tumefaciens lpxQ gene was amplified by PCR followed by ligation into the pET21b+ vector. The N-terminal primer for the PCRs had the following sequence: 5′-CGCGCATATGTCGCGCCATACTTTACTTGTTTGC-3′. This primer was designed with a G/C clamp, an NdeI restriction site (in italics) that overlaps with the initiation codon ATG and the first 26 base pairs of the A. tumefaciens lpxQgene coding sequence (in bold type). The C-terminal primer was designed with a G/C clamp, a BamHI site (in italics), and sequence (in bold type) corresponding to a region that is 52 base pairs downstream of the lpxQ TAA termination codon. The sequence of the C-terminal primer was: 5′-GCGCGGATCCTGGAACTGCTGGACTGGGCTTATGG-3′. A. tumefaciens C58 genomic DNA purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was used as the template. The PCR mixture (100 ॖl) contained 250 ng of template DNA, 1×Pfu polymerase buffer (Stratagene), 107 Me2SO, 17 glycerol, 200 ॖm of each of the dNTPs, 125 ng of each primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene).

https://openalex.org/W2155345824,"TIA-1 and TIAR are a pair of related RNA-binding proteins which have been implicated in apoptosis. We show that chicken DT40 cells with both tia-1 alleles and one tiarallele disrupted (tia-1(−/−)tiar(−/+) cells) are viable. However, their growth and survival in medium containing low serum levels is significantly reduced compared with DT40 cells. The remaining intact tiar allele intia-1(−/−)tiar(−/+) cells can only be disrupted if TIA-1 expression is first restored to the cells by transfection of a TIA-1 expression vector. We conclude that DT40 cells require either TIA-1 or TIAR for viability. TIA-1 overexpression intia-1(−/−)tiar(−/+) cells leads to a radical drop in TIAR levels, by inducing efficient splicing of twotiar alternative exons carrying in-frame stop codons. In wild-type DT40 cells, tiar transcripts including these exons can also be detected. These transcripts increase significantly in abundance in cycloheximide-treated cells, suggesting that splicing of the exons exposes mRNAs to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. TIA-1 or TIAR depletion leads to a marked drop in splicing of the exons. The human tiar gene contains a corresponding pair of TIA-1-inducible alternative exons, and we show that there is very high sequence conservation between chickens and humans of the exon pair and parts of the flanking introns. The TIA-1/TIAR responsiveness of these alternative tiar exons is likely to be of physiological importance for controlling TIAR levels."
https://openalex.org/W1965679878,"The Escherichia coli mazEF operon defines a chromosomal addiction module that programs cell death under various stress conditions. It encodes the toxic and long-lived MazF and the labile antidote MazE. The denaturation of MazE is a two-state reversible dimer-monomer transition. At lower concentrations the denatured state is significantly populated. This leads to a new aspect of the regulation of MazE concentration, which may decide about the life and death of the cell. Interactions of MazE with a dromedary antibody domain, cAbMaz1 (previously used as a crystallization aid), as well as with promoter DNA were studied using microcalorimetric and spectroscopic techniques. Unique features of cAbMaz1 enable a specific enthalpy-driven recognition of MazE and, thus, a significant stabilization of its dimeric native conformation. The MazE dimer and the MazE dimer-cAbMaz1 complex show very similar binding characteristics with promoter DNA, i.e. three binding sites with apparent affinities in micromolar range and highly exothermic binding accompanied by large negative entropy contributions. A working model for the MazE-DNA assembly is proposed on the basis of the structural and binding data.

In the absence of co-expression the antidote is rapidly degraded by a specific protease, enabling the toxin to attack its target. The target of the toxin is known only in the plasmidic ccdAB and kid-kissystems. In ccdAB, CcdB on plasmid F attacks the A subunit of gyrase, whereas in the kid-kis system Kid on plasmid R1 targets DnaB (19Bernard P. Coutrier M. J. Mol.

Until recently, attention was paid mainly to the extrachromosomal (plasmid) addiction modules, which are responsible for the death that occurs upon accidental plasmid loss (3Yarmolinsky M.B.

However, theE. coli chromosome also contains several operons homologous to those found in plasmid addiction systems (22Masuda J. Miyakawa K. Nishimura Y. Ohtsubo E. J.

The first discovered regulable prokaryotic chromosomal addiction module is themazEF system (or chpA), which encodes for toxic and long-lived MazF and anti-toxic and short-lived MazE (6Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar,9Marianovsky I. Aizeman E. Egelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. J. Biol.

In contrast to the extra-chromosomal addiction modules that are triggered by plasmid loss, death mediated by the chromosomalmazEF is achieved under several stress conditions that prevent mazEF expression. It was initially found that themazEF module is under the control of 3′,5′-guanosinebispyrophosphate (ppGpp) (25Aizenman E. Engelberg-Kulka H. Glaser G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

American Society of Microbiology, Washington D. C.1996: 1458-1496Google Scholar). Overproduction of ppGpp leads to inhibition of the expression of mazEF and, thereby, to cell death (25Aizenman E.

However, inhibition ofmazEF expression, and thus induction of cell death, can also be achieved by using general inhibitors of transcription and/or translation like antibiotics (rifampicin, chloramphenicol and spectinomycin) (28Sat B.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2046-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), the inhibition of gene expression leads to a lack of the labile MazE and, thereby, allows the action of the more stable MazF to kill the cells. To improve our understanding of addiction systems at the molecular level, structural and also thermodynamic characterization of the proteins involved is needed. The latter is difficult to achieve because of the problems of expression of the toxins and the labile character of the antidotes. Therefore, for some time only a crystal structure of the toxin CcdB has been known (31Loris R. Dao-Thi M.-H. Bahassi E.M. Van Melderen L. Poortmans F. Liddington R. Couturier M. Wyns L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 285: 1667-1677Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The thermodynamic information on addiction proteins is also rather scarce, and often only partial answers are available (10Gazid E.

Antibodies and their derivative fragments have long been used as tools in a variety of applications in fundamental research, biotechnology, diagnosis, and human therapy (35Glennie M.J. Johnson P.W.

In contrast to conventional IgG molecules, one type of the antibodies generated by camels, dromedaries, and llamas (camelids) is formed by two heavy chains but has no light chains (37Hamers-Casterman C.

Particularly interesting are camelid single variable domain antibody fragments (VHH), which contain the smallest antigen-binding unit with a molecular size of ≈15 kDa. They are characterized by high-yield production, high solubility, and high thermodynamic stability (38Dumoulin M. Conrath K. van Meirhaeghe A. Meersman F. Heremans K. Frenken L.G.J. Muyldermans S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 3628-3636Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As MazE alone has a large fraction of unstructured polypeptide, a MazE-specific VHH (cAbMaz1) fragment has been used as a crystallization aid, leading to the first crystal structure of an addiction antidote. 1R. Loris, I. Marianovsky, J. Lah, T. Laermans, H. Engelberg-Kulka, G. Glaser, S. Muyldermans, and L. Wyns, submitted for publication. In the current paper we focus on the thermodynamics of the MazE-cAbMaz1 and MazE-DNA (MazE promoter) interacting systems and correlate it with the structure. The research described here is the first example of a characterization of MazE binding and denaturation energetics. Expression and purification of MazE and the cAbMaz1 fragment are described elsewhere. 1R. Loris, I. Marianovsky, J. Lah, T. Laermans, H. Engelberg-Kulka, G. Glaser, S. Muyldermans, and L. Wyns, submitted for publication. MazE and cAbMaz1 solutions for spectroscopic and calorimetric measurements were prepared by extensive dialysis against 50 mm sodium cacodylic buffer, pH 6.9, containing 150 mm NaCl and a 10-min degassing of the sample solutions before the measurements. For DNA binding studies, the same buffer without additional salt was used. Concentrations of a 98-residue-long, His tag-fused MazE protein and a 135-residue-long cAbMaz1 antibody (Fig. 1) were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 280 nm. The corresponding extinction coefficients were obtained from MazE and cAbMaz1 amino acid compositions by the method introduced by Gill and von Hippel (41Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar) (www.expasy.ch). The 50-base pair, double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-TGCTCGTATCTACAATGTAGATTGATATATACTGTATCTACATATGATAG-3′ and 3′-ACGAGCATAGATGTTACATCTAACTATATATGACATAGATGTATACTATC-5′) containing the MazE promoter sequence (underlined) was purchased from Invitrogen. To evaluate the specificity of MazE binding to the promoter DNA, the 107-bp control (not related to mazEF module) DNA was used. The same DNA was used as a control (not related) DNA in the studies of the ccdAB addiction module as well (32Dao-Thi M.-H. Messens J. Wyns L. Backmann J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1373-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Lyophilized single strands were dissolved in 50 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.9, and extensively dialyzed against the same buffer. The concentrations of single strands were determined by UV absorption spectroscopy at 260 nm by using extinction coefficients calculated on the basis of the nearest neighbor approximation (42Cantor C.R. Warshaw M.M. Shapiro H. Biopolymers. 1970; 9: 1059-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The duplexes were obtained by mixing the corresponding single strands in the 1:1 molar ratio. isothermal titration calorimetry fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism diffferential scanning calorimetry accessible surface area isothermal titration calorimetry fluorescence spectroscopy circular dichroism diffferential scanning calorimetry accessible surface area The heat accompanying MazE + cAbMaz1, DNA + MazE, and DNA + MazE-cAbMaz1 associations was measured by an Omega isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). In MazE + cAbMaz1 experiments at 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C the MazE dimer solution (1.33 ml) was titrated by cAbMaz1 solution in the same buffer using a motor-driven 250-μl syringe. cAbMaz1 concentration was about 100 μm, whereas the MazE dimer concentration in the titration cell was 4.8 μm. DNA + MazE and DNA + MazE-cAbMaz1 experiments were performed at 25 °C. MazE dimer and MazE-cAbMaz1 concentrations were around 50 μm, whereas the DNA concentration in the titration cell was about 50 times lower. Each injection generated a heat burst, with the area under the curve being proportional to the heat of interaction (Fig. 5a). The titration curves (Figs.5b and 8) were constructed by subtraction of the heat effects that accompany the ligand dilution.Figure 8FL (○) and calorimetric (■) titration curves accompanying DNA + MazE (M2) association at 25 °C in comparison with corresponding control (unrelated) DNA + M2FL (▵) and ITC (▴) curves.

MazE + cAbMaz1 titrations were performed at 25 °C and 45 °C by incrementally injecting 4–20-μl aliquots of cAbMaz1 solution into 2 ml of 0.5–1 μm MazE dimer solution in the same buffer. After each injection, FL emission spectrum was recorded between 290 and 480 nm (λext = 280 nm). In the case of DNA titration with MazE at 25 °C the emission spectrum was recorded between 310 and 380 nm (λext = 300 nm). The 1.5 μm DNA oligomer containing the promoter sequence was titrated by a 21 μmsolution of MazE dimer. CD spectra were recorded on J-715 spectropolarimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan). MazE + cAbMaz1 titrations were performed at 25 and 45 °C by incrementally injecting 4–20 μl aliquots of cAbMaz1 solution into 2 ml of ∼1 μm MazE dimer solution (1-cm cuvette) in the same buffer. After each injection, the ellipticity, θ, was monitored between 210 and 260 nm (Fig. 3). The denaturation of MazE, cAbMaz1, and their tetrameric complex was followed by recording the far UV (205–260 nm) CD spectra at different temperatures with the temperature step of 2 or 1 °C at the transition region (Fig. 7). The temperature of the sample was controlled by a sensor built into the cuvette holder and connected to a Haake N3 (Gebrueder Haake, Karlsruhe, Germany) circulating bath which adjusted the temperature of the sample with an accuracy of 0.1 °C. The concentrations of MazE, cAbMaz1, and their tetrameric complex in a 0.1- or 0.2-cm cuvette were about 10 μm.Figure 7Panel a, far UV CD spectra of tetrameric MazE-cAbMaz1 complex (M2“A2“) measured from 40 to 95 °C.

The heating rate was 1 °C/min, and the concentration of proteins in the measuring cell (0.33 ml) was about 10 μm. To obtain the presented thermograms (ΔCPversus T curves, Fig. 6a), the heat capacity of the protein in the native state was subtracted from the raw signal (corrected for buffer contribution). The transition enthalpies ΔHcalwere obtained by integration of ΔCPversus T curves. Two consecutive temperature scans were carried out to observe the extent of reversibility, which was higher than 0.8 for all the proteins. Changes in the spectral properties (Figs. 3 and 4) suggest that the cAbMaz1-MazE complex formation is accompanied by structural alterations of MazE or/and cAbMaz1. Moreover, binding of the first cAbMaz1 molecule to one MazE dimer binding site influences the binding of the second one to the other available site. Thus, the spectral changes (CD and FL) and the heat effects seen during titration experiments may contain contributions from direct binding and structural changes. To describe the cAbMaz1-MazE association, a mass action model that includes the mentioned contributions is proposed, as shown below in Reaction 1, M2+A↔K1M2′A′+A↔K2M″2A″2Reaction 1 with K1 and K2defined in Equations 1 and 2, respectively,K1=[M2′A′][M2][A](Eq. 1) K2=[M″2A″2][M2′A′][A](Eq. 2) and where M2, A, M′2A′, and M“2A”2 represent the MazE dimer, the cAbMaz1 monomer, and their trimeric and tetrameric complexes in the native state, respectively. Quantities in the square brackets are the equilibrium molar concentrations; K1 andK2 are the corresponding apparent association constants. Overall change in the thermodynamic quantity (standard Gibbs free energy, ΔG°; standard enthalpy, ΔH°; standard entropy, ΔS°) for the presented process can be expressed as a sum of contributions of the M“2 + 2A” association as rigid bodies in the final conformation and other contributions which involve the conformational changes,ΔG°=ΔGrb°+ΔGother°(Eq. 3) ΔGrb°=−RTln([M″2A″2]/[M″2][A″]2)(Eq. 4) ΔGother°=−RTln([M″2]/[M2])+2ln([A″]/[A])](Eq. 5) as shown above in Equations 3, 4, and 5. It follows that the contributions of conformational effects (other) can be estimated as a difference between experimentally obtained ΔG°, ΔH°, and TΔS° and the corresponding ΔGrb°, ΔHrb°, andTΔSrb°, which were estimated by M2′′A2′′-structure-based calculations. By assuming linear dependence of a measured physical property (F) on the concentration of individual components in ideal solution, it is possible, by subtracting the contributions of M2 and A, to obtain the difference in physical property (ΔF), which can be expressed as shown below (43Lah J. Maier N.M. Lindner W. Vesnaver G. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2001; 105: 1670-1678Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) in Equation 6,ΔF=∑​2i=1Δfi[M2′Ai′]where Δfi=fM2′Ai′−fM2−ifAand if i=1⇒ =′ and if i=2⇒′ =″(Eq. 6) where fM2,fA, andfM′2A′i are concentration-independent physical properties of M2, A and M′2A′i, respectively. In each of the techniques used in this work, the described properties have specific physical meaning as defined in the following: (i) FL (Fig.3b), where ΔF is difference fluorescence and Δfi depends on the optical path length, quantum yields, intensity of incident light, and molar extinction coefficients of M2, A, and M′2A′i; (ii) CD, where ΔF = Δθ = difference ellipticity and Δfi is the product between difference molar ellipticity of M′2A′i and optical path length; (iii) ITC (Fig. 8), where ΔF =Q = cumulative heat effect given per mole of added ligand at single injection and Δfi is the product between ΔHi° (standard enthalpy of M′2A′i complex formation) and the volume of solution in the measuring cell divided by the amount of added ligand per injection. In the ITC, the differential form of Equation 6 is usually used where the signal is given as ΔH (enthalpy change given per mole of added ligand at single injection) and Δfi as ΔHi° (Fig.5b). In the case of DNA + M2 titration, the model that assumes binding of M2 on identical sites on DNA was used. The model was derived from Reaction 1 and Equations 1 and 6 for i = 1. It follows from Reaction 1 and Equation 6 that spectroscopic and calorimetric titration curves (Figs. 3b, 5b, and8) can be at given total concentrations of M2 and A described only in terms of parameters Δfi andKi. Their values were obtained by fitting the model functions (Equation 6) to the experimental titration curves using the non-linear procedure based on Levenberg-Marquardt minimization of the non-weighted χ2 function (44Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1992: 650-694Google Scholar). Our results reveal that all monitored denaturation processes can be adequately described as reversible two state transitions, as presented in Reaction 2 and Equation 7, Nn↔KnDReaction 2 ΔG°=−RTlnK=−RTln(nα)n[P]n−11−α(Eq. 7) where Nn represents M2 (n = 2), A (n = 1) and M“2A”2 (n = 4) in the native state, while D corresponds to the MazE and cAbMaz1 in the denatured state. K is the equilibrium constant of denaturation, ΔG° is the corresponding standard Gibbs free energy change, n is the number of subunits to which each protein dissociates upon denaturation, α is the degree of denaturation, and [P] is the total protein concentration given per mole of protein in its native state. ΔG° can also be expressed by the integrated Gibbs-Helmholtz equation shown below in Equation 8,ΔG°=T{ΔG°(T1/2)T1/2+ΔH°(T1/2)[1T−1T1/2]+ΔCP°[1−T1/2T−ln(TT1/2)]}(Eq. 8) in which ΔH°(T1/2) is the standard enthalpy of denaturation at the reference temperatureT1/2 (transition temperature at α = 0.5), and ΔCP° is the corresponding standard heat capacity change assumed to be independent of temperature. According to the model (Reaction 2 and Equation 7), α can be expressed as a function of ellipticity, θ (measured at single wavelength), as shown in Equation 9,α=θ−θNθD−θN(Eq. 9) where θN and θD are the ellipticities of the native and denatured state, respectively, which are assumed to be linear functions of temperature. In the case of DSC, the measured ΔCP (native state is a reference state) can be expressed as (45Freire E. Biltonen R.L.

Taking into account Reaction 2 and Equations 7 and 8, the temperature profile can be described in terms of parameters ΔH °(T1/2), ΔCP°, and T1/2. Their values were obtained by fitting of the model function (CD = Equation 9; DSC = Equation 10) to the experimental temperature profiles using the previously mentioned non-linear χ2regression procedure (44Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1992: 650-694Google Scholar). The non-polar (ASAN) and polar accessible surface areas (ASAP) of proteins were calculated with the program NACCESS, version 2.1 (48Hubbard S.J. Thornton J.M. NACCESS Computer Program. Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University College, London1993Google Scholar). The ASA of native proteins was obtained from the crystal structure of the MazE-cAbMaz1 complex (probe size = 1.4 Å).

We show that each epipubic bone is part of a kinetic linkage extending from the femur, by way of the pectineus muscle, to the epipubic bone, through the pyramidalis and rectus abdominis muscles on one side of the abdomen, and through the contralateral external and internal oblique muscles to the vertebrae and ribs of the opposite side. This muscle series is activated synchronously as the femur and contralateral forelimb are retracted during the stance phase in locomotion. The epipubic bone acts as a lever that is retracted (depressed) to stiffen the trunk between the diagonal limbs that support the body during each step. This cross-couplet kinetic linkage and the stiffening function of the epipubic bone appear to be the primitive conditions for mammals."

MIP-1β-induced G-protein activation was further increased by simultaneous stimulation of CD4 with its natural agonist, interleukin-16. Thus, the physical association of CD4 and CCR5 results in receptor cross-talk with allosteric CD4-dependent regulation of the binding and signaling properties of CCR5.

CD4 and CCR5 act in concert for HIV-1 entry by a sequential, ordered, multistep mechanism. Both receptors are expressed on lymphoid cells but belong to unrelated receptor families. CCR5 is a member of the heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), whereas CD4 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of membrane receptors with a single transmembrane segment that contributes to signal transduction through its cytoplasmic association with the lymphocyte kinase Lck (8Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar). GPCRs have been known to associate with each other, but only recently has hetero-oligomerization between unrelated receptors with direct coupling been demonstrated in co-localized neurotransmitter systems (9Bouvier M.

Here, we present data that demonstrates that CD4 and CCR5, both of which are involved in leukocyte activation and HIV-1 infectivity, form a unique receptor complex that is distinct from CCR5 alone with respect to affinity for its ligand, macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1β), and for G-protein signaling. We have shown previously that CD4 and CCR5 are physically associated even in the absence of the gp120 glycoprotein (15Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L.

It has been demonstrated that this interaction is unique to CD4 and CCR5 and is mediated through the second extracellular loop of CCR5 and the first two domains of CD4. To investigate the interaction between CCR5 and CD4, we have now used human osteosarcoma HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ and HOS-CD4−-CCR5+ cells to study the pharmacological and biochemical properties of these two HIV-1 receptor molecules. Here we present data suggesting cross-talk between these molecules. [125I]MIP-1β, [35S]guanosine-5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate ([35S]GTPγS) and soluble CD4 (sCD4) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. MIP-1β was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The CD4 antiserum T4-4 was obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The polyclonal anti-CCR5 antibody CKR-5 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and cyclohexyl-pentyl-β-d-maltoside (Cymal-5™) was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Recombinant two-fragment (first and second domains) soluble CD4 (D1D2-sCD4) was a gift by Dr. Ed Berger. HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ and HOS-CD4−CCR5+ (5Deng H. Liu R. Ellmeier W. Choe S. Unutmaz D. Burkhart M.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)), and then homogenized by 40 strokes with a tight pestle in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei and unbroken cells were then pelleted by low speed centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C.The crude membrane pellet was washed once and then resuspended in above buffer with the aid of a Dounce homogenizer. All binding studies, which are described in detail elsewhere (16Staudinger R. Wang X. Bandres J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), were performed at 20 °C in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin in a final assay volume of 0.1–0.25 ml. [125I]MIP-1β (72–272 pm) was incubated with 0.048–0.17 mg/ml membrane protein for 60 min. Receptor-bound radioligand was separated from unbound ligand by filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. Filters were washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold incubation buffer containing 500 mm NaCl. Cf2Th/synCCR5 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Joseph Sodroski. This canine thymocyte cell line stably expresses CCR5, which is expanded by the C9 tag TETSQVAPA (17Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol.

This tag is recognized by the 1D4 antibody, which was obtained from the National Cell Culture Center, National Institutes of Health. Cells were grown to confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mm glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5 mg/ml G418, 0.5 mg/ml zeocin, and 3 μg/ml puromycin. Prior to harvesting, cells were incubated with 4 mm sodium butyrate for 40 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and detached by treatment with 5 mm EDTA. Cells were solubilized for 30 min with 3 ml of solubilization buffer containing Cymal-5™ as described (17Mirzabekov T. Bannert N. Farzan M. Hofmann W. Kolchinsky P. Wu L. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28745-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The lysate was incubated with 1D4-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 10–12 h. The Sepharose beads were then washed five times with 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm(NH4)2SO4, 10% glycerol, and 1% Cymal-5™; the last wash included 500 mmMgCl2. CCR5 was eluted from the Sepharose beads with washing buffer containing 200 μm C9 peptide (TETSQVAPA) and 500 mm MgCl2. The concentration of harvested CCR5 was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of an SDS polyacrylamide gel. 0.05–0.75 μg/ml of D1D2-sCD4 or sCD4 was coated onto the ELISA plate in 50 mmcarbonate, pH 9.6. Free binding sites were blocked with 4% milk in Tris-buffered saline. 1 μg/ml purified CCR5 was added in buffer containing 1% Cymal-5™ and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Bound CCR5 was detected with the goat anti-CCR5 antibody CKR5 and an alkaline phosphatase-linked anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). [35S]GTPγS binding was carried out in 50 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol containing 10 μm GDP and 15 μg of membrane protein at 20 °C as described in detail previously (18Beckner S.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 288: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 ml of ice cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and filtration through Whatman GF/C filters. We have previously found that CD4 can be coimmunoprecipitated by anti-CCR5 antibodies from cells coexpressing the two molecules (15Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C. Sattentau Q.J. Dimitrov D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7496-7501Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To further study this interaction, we developed a binding assay using purified receptor proteins. Increasing concentrations of D1D2-sCD4 as well as full-length sCD4 were coated onto ELISA plates. Incubation with purified CCR5 showed a concentration-dependent binding of CCR5 to both D1D2-sCD4 and sCD4 (Fig. 1 A). To further demonstrate the specificity of the CD4-CCR5 interaction, we used the polyclonal anti-CD4 antiserum T4-4 and the monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody OKT4 in these binding experiments. As illustrated in Fig.1 B, CCR5 bound specifically to D1D2-sCD4 as demonstrated by inhibition of CCR5 binding to CD4 by the anti-CD4 antiserum T4-4. The monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody OKT4, which was previously used to coimmunoprecipitate CD4 and CCR5 (15Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z. Riley J.L. Broder C.C.

Med. 1999; 5: 303Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), had no effect on the interaction of the two purified receptor molecules. We compared the ligand binding properties of CCR5 with those of CCR5-CD4 complexes. Competition binding experiments with125I-labeled MIP-1β to membranes from HOS cells expressing either CCR5 or both CCR5 and CD4 are shown in Fig.2 A. Scatchard transformation revealed that the affinity of CCR5 for its ligand MIP-1β decreased by 3.5-fold when CD4 was coexpressed (Fig. 2 B). We calculated by Scatchard analysis dissociation constants (K D) of 278 ± 20 pm and 997 ± 115 pm for MIP-1β for HOS-CD4−-CCR5+ and HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ cell membranes, respectively. The CD4-CCR5 complex has therefore distinct pharmacological properties from CCR5, with the coexpression of CD4 resulting in a partial inhibitory effect on MIP-1β binding to CCR5 due to a decrease in the affinity of CCR5 for its chemokine ligand. The CCR5 receptor density was similar in the two membrane preparations. The [125I]MIP-1β binding sites were 1.47 ± 0.1 pmol/mg and 1.88 ± 0.12 pmol/mg in HOS-CD4−-CCR5+ and HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ cell membranes, respectively. The CD4 receptor density in our HOS-CD4+-CCR5+cell membranes was in excess of that of the CCR5 receptors with 9.43 ± 0.4 pmol/mg as determined by125I-gp120YU2 binding (data not shown). Interestingly, pre-incubation of HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ membranes with the T4-4 antiserum, which inhibits the association of CD4 and CCR5 (15Xiao X. Wu L. Stantchev T.S. Feng Y.R. Ugolini S. Chen H. Shen Z.

R5-tropic gp120 (YU2 and ADA), X4-tropic gp120 (LAI) (100 nm each), IL-16 (5 μg/ml), the anti-CD4 antibodies T4-4 (1:100) or OKT4 (10 μg/ml) were pre-incubated with membranes for 1–6 h before the addition of [125I]MIP-1β. The effect on [125I]MIP-1β binding was assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Gp120 and IL-16 are the known ligands to CD4. A natural ligand for CD4 IL-16 has been identified and characterized as having a variety of biological effects similar to gp120 (20Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5109-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). R5-tropic gp120 has been shown to bind to CCR5 after interaction with CD4 and interfere with MIP-1β binding to CCR5 (21Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 22Trkola A. Dragic T. Arthos J. Binley J.M. Olson W.C. Allaway G.P. Cheng-Mayer C. Robinson J. Maddon P.J. Moore J.P. Nature. 1996; 384: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). We tested whether activation of CD4 by IL-16 would affect the binding properties of the CD4-CCR5 complex for MIP-1β. As seen in Fig. 3, IL-16 did not affect the interaction of the CD4-CCR5 complex with MIP-1β, confirming data previously reported (23Mashikian M.V. Ryan T.C. Seman A. Brazer W. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3123-3130PubMed Google Scholar). However, R5 tropic gp120 (ADA and YU2) interfered with MIP-1β binding to HOS-CD4+-CCR5+membranes, whereas X4-tropic gp120 had no effect. We next investigated whether there is a functional role for the physical interaction of these two receptor molecules and whether the physiologic response of the CD4-CCR5 complex is distinct from that of CCR5. For this purpose, we measured G-protein activation in HOS-CD4−-CCR5+and HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ membranes by assessing [35S]GTPγS binding. GTPγ S interacts with the G-proteins with high affinity but is not hydrolyzed (24Northup J.K. Smigel M.D. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11416-11423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-protein activation is classically studied in membrane preparations, because guanine nucleotides cannot penetrate intact cells. As can be seen in Fig. 4, MIP-1β (100 nm) accelerated the basal rate of [35S]GTPγS binding in HOS-CD4−-CCR5+ membranes, as expected for an agonist to CCR5. In HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ membranes, the addition of IL-16 further stimulated G-protein activation through CCR5. The rate constants were calculated assuming a pseudo-first order association as described (25Evans S.W. Beckner S.K. Farrar W.L. Nature. 1987; 325: 166-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and are presented in TableI. IL-16 alone had no effect on CCR5+ or CD4+CCR5+ cell membranes but doubled the rate constant in the presence of MIP-1β on CD4+CCR5+ membranes. Therefore, simultaneous occupation by the two agonists results in the most active signaling form.Table IG-protein activation in membranes from HOS cells expressing CCR5 or both CCR5 and CD4Cell membraneControlMIP-1β (100nm)IL-16 (5 μg/ml)MIP-1β (100 nM) + IL-16HOS-CD4−-CCR5+0.042 ± 0.0020.10 ± 0.010.040 ± 0.0030.10 ± 0.02HOS-CD4+-CCR5+0.041 ± 0.0010.12 ± 0.020.043 ± 0.0030.238 ± 0.004[35S]GTPγS binding to cell membranes was measured in the absence (control) or presence of 100 nm MIP-1β, 5 μg/ml IL-16, or 100 nm MIP-1β plus 5 μg/ml IL-16.

The rate constants were calculated assuming a pseudo-first order association and are presented as mean from three independent experiments. Our results demonstrate that CD4 and CCR5 functionally associate on the plasma membrane and that co-receptors involved with immune stimulation and HIV-1 entry, which are members of unrelated receptor families, can interact. We provide biochemical and functional evidence for direct CD4-CCR5 cross-talk; CD4-CCR5 interaction leads to synergy such that CCR5 signaling is increased as a result of activation of CD4 by IL-16. The coexpression of CD4 itself had no effect on MIP-1β-induced signaling of CCR5. Our data confirm a previous report wherein no effect of CD4 coexpression was found in chemokine-induced CCR5 internalization experiments (26Mueller A. Mahmoud N.G. Goedecke M.C. McKeating J.A. Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) but also show that stimulation of CD4 enhances CCR5 function. The CD4-CCR5 complex is also pharmacologically distinct from CCR5 in that it is characterized by a lower affinity for binding to MIP-1β. The association of CD4 and CCR5 at the cell membrane is reversible, because the T4-4 antiserum, which inhibits this interaction, stimulated MIP-1β binding. Therefore, we suggest a model in which CD4, by associating with CCR5, allosterically modulates the binding properties of CCR5 for MIP-1β, exhibiting decreased affinity for its ligand. Stimulation of CD4 with IL-16 does not further affect the binding of MIP-1β to CCR5, but leads to enhanced signaling of CCR5. Mueller et al. (26Mueller A. Mahmoud N.G. Goedecke M.C. McKeating J.A. Strange P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 1033-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported earlier a difference in MIP-1β-induced internalization of CCR5 in CHO-CCR5+ and CHO-CCR5+-CD4+ cells. The authors could demonstrate that this difference was attributable to the different levels of CCR5 expression in the two cell lines (8-fold difference in CCR5 levels). In the cell line selected for our experiments, CD4 coexpression did not significantly affect the level of CCR5. We determined a similar MIP-1β binding site density in HOS-CD4−-CCR5+and HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ membranes (1.47versus 1.88 pmol/mg). Furthermore, we have shown earlier that, after uncoupling from the G-protein, CCR5 can no longer bind MIP-1β (16Staudinger R. Wang X. Bandres J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, the difference in affinity of CCR5 in HOS-CD4−-CCR5+ and HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ membranes cannot be attributed to a difference in the level of CCR5 expression in the two cell lines, because uncoupled CCR5 receptors do not exhibit detectable affinity for CCR5 (16Staudinger R. Wang X. Bandres J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We chose a cell line for our experiments that expressed CD4 in excess of CCR5 so that, presumably, the CCR5 receptors are “saturated” with CD4. It will be interesting to determine whether there is a reciprocal effect of CCR5 on the binding and signaling properties of CD4. It was previously reported that IL-16-induced chemotaxis is partially inhibited by pertussis toxin, and it was suggested that if a direct interaction of IL-16 with CCR5 exists, it could contribute to a CD4-induced migratory signal (23Mashikian M.V. Ryan T.C. Seman A. Brazer W. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3123-3130PubMed Google Scholar). Our data could provide an explanation for how CCR5 contributes to a CD4-induced signal. Our findings may also have important implications for HIV-1 evolution and immunopathogenesis, because it has been suggested by many that a precursor of HIV-1 used CCR5 as the primary receptor (27Edinger A.L. Mankowski J.L. Doranz B.J. Margulies B.J. Lee B. Rucker J. Sharron M. Hoffman T.L. Berson J.F. Zink M.C. Hirsch V.M. Clements J.E. Doms R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

HIV-1 has to react sequentially with its receptors to gain entry into a susceptible cell, and the formation of complexes between the HIV-1 receptors may make the entry process more efficient. Finally, our data suggest a previously unknown signal transduction mechanism for chemokine receptors and immunoreceptors. If receptor interactions are a widespread phenomenon in cells of the immune system, the array of receptor complexes could be immense. Association of distinct receptor molecules would combine specificity with flexibility. Specificity would guarantee binding of the ligand to its receptor, but hetero-oligomerization would define a new level of functional diversity, depending on which receptor(s) are expressed by a particular cell and which ones form specific receptor complexes."

Whereas the more typical Escherichia coli lipid A is a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′, R. etli and R. leguminosarum lipid A consists of a mixture of structurally related species (designated A–E) that lack phosphate. A conserved distal unit, comprised of a diacylated glucosamine moiety with galacturonic acid residue at position 4′ and a secondary 27-hydroxyoctacosanoyl (27-OH-C28) as part of a 2′ acyloxyacyl moiety, is present in all five components. The proximal end is heterogeneous, differing in the number and lengths of acyl chains and in the identity of the sugar itself. A proximal glucosamine unit is present in B and C, but an unusual 2-amino-2-deoxy-gluconate moiety is found in D-1 and E. We now demonstrate that membranes ofR. leguminosarum and R. etli can convert B to D-1 in a reaction that requires added detergent and is inhibited by EDTA.

Mass spectrometry demonstrates that B is oxidized in vitro to a substance that is 16 atomic mass units larger, consistent with the formation of D-1. The oxidation of the lipid A proximal unit is also demonstrated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry in the positive and negative modes using the model substrate, 1-dephospho-lipid IVA.

The structure of LPS may be subdivided into the lipid A region, which embeds the LPS in the outer membrane, the nonrepeating core oligosaccharide, and the distal O-antigen polysaccharide.

Although the classical lipid A structure, typified by that ofEscherichia coli, consists of a hexa-acylated disaccharide of glucosamine that is phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′ (15Raetz C.R.H.

A conserved distal unit, comprised of a diacylated glucosamine residue with a secondary 27-OH-C28 acyl chain as part of an acyloxyacyl moiety at position 2′ and a galacturonic acid residue at position 4′, is present in all of the components (Fig. 1) (24Que N.L.S.

The microheterogeneity of R. etli lipid A arises mainly in the proximal unit, which may contain acyl chains of different lengths at position 2 or may be deacylated at position 3 (Fig. 1). Although glucosamine constitutes the proximal units of components B and C, its oxidized form, 2-amino-2-deoxy-gluconate (2-aminogluconate), is present in D-1 and E (Fig. 1) (24Que N.L.S. Lin S.

White K.A. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1284Google Scholar). Component A (not shown in Fig. 1) appears to be an elimination product generated from D-1 during the mild acid hydrolysis procedure used to release lipid A from the LPS core (24Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Google Scholar, 25Que N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28017-28027Google Scholar). D-2 is an isomer formed from D-1 in a nonenzymatic reaction and is attributed to acyl chain migration on the proximal unit (24Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Google Scholar,25Que N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28017-28027Google Scholar). To date, the occurrence of the 2-aminogluconate moiety is limited to the lipid A of R. etli and R. leguminosarum (23Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Google Scholar,24Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Google Scholar). A plausible pathway for 2-aminogluconate formation could involve the oxidation of the proximal glucosamine unit of component B to generate D-1. In conjunction with our recent re-evaluation of the structures of R. etli and R. leguminosarum lipid A (25Que N.L.S. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28017-28027Google Scholar), we discovered that crude extracts of R. etli and R. leguminosarum can convert 14C-labeled component B to a lipid that migrates with D-1 during thin layer chromatography. We now report the detailed characterization of this novel oxidative reaction using both the natural product B and the relatively simple model substrate, 1-dephospho-lipid IVA. Remarkably, the enzyme is an outer membrane protein and is presumed to be an oxidase. These findings are consistent with the idea that 2-aminogluconate formation is a late step in R. leguminosarum lipid A biosynthesis. As demonstrated in the accompanying manuscript, a novel gene, designated lpxQ, encodes the putative oxidase. Glass-backed 0.25-mm Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates were from Merck.

Rhizobium cultures (0.5 to 1 liter) were grown to late log phase (OD550 = ∼1.0) and then harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. The cell pellets were washed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with a volume that was 1/10th that of the original culture volume. The cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in a minimal volume (usually 5 ml) of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and stored at −80 °C if they were not immediately lysed. The frozen cells were thawed, resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼3–10 mg/ml, and broken by three passages through an ice-cold French pressure cell (SLM Instruments, Urbana, IL) at 18,000 p.s.i.

After a second ultracentrifugation, the washed membranes were homogenized in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼5–15 mg/ml. The samples were stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

The culture was centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 7.8 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA, and the cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. Crude cell-free extract was prepared by removal of unbroken cells and large debris by centrifugation at 12,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. One-half of the crude extract was stored at −80 °C, whereas the remaining half was used to prepare washed membranes, as described above. The washed membranes were homogenized with a 25-gauge 1/2 syringe needle in a total volume of 2.5 ml of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mmEDTA. After being layered on top of a seven-step isopycnic sucrose gradient as described by Guy-Caffey et al. (32Guy-Caffey J.K. Rapoza M.P. Jolley K.A. Webster R.E. J.

The fractions (0.5. ml) were collected, and their protein content was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay, as described above. The following undiluted fraction volumes were used for the various assays: 3 ॖl for the lipid A oxidase reaction, which was terminated after 30 min; 50 ॖl for the NADH oxidase assay (33Osborn M.J.

Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). The lower phases from both extractions were pooled and dried down under a stream of N2. The dried product was then redissolved in 450 ॖl of CHCl3/MeOH (4:1, v/v) and spotted in a line 20 mm from the edge of a 20 × 20-cm silica TLC plate. The plate was allowed to dry and developed in CHCl3, pyridine, 887 formic acid, H2O (50:50:16:5, v/v) until the solvent front was ∼5 cm from the top of the plate. The solvents were removed by drying the plate with a cold air stream for 30 min. The band of interest, which is transiently visible as a white zone during the drying process, was localized by placing the plate on top of a light box. The band was outlined in pencil and scraped off with a clean razor blade. The silica chips were transferred into a 16 × 125-mm glass tube equipped with a Teflon-lined cap. The lipid was extracted from the chips by resuspending them in 3.8 ml of an acidic single-phase Bligh-Dyer solution, consisting of CHCl3, MeOH, 0.1m HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v), followed by brief sonic irradiation. The solution was then converted into a two-phase Bligh-Dyer mixture by adding 3 ml of CHCl3, 2 ml of MeOH, and 2.8 ml of distilled H2O. After thorough mixing and centrifugation for 8 min in a clinical centrifuge, the lower phase was recovered and passed through a Pasteur pipette plugged with glass wool. The extraction of the chips was repeated once, and three drops of pyridine were added to the pooled lower phases to neutralize any residual HCl. After drying the lower phases with a stream of N2, the sample was stored at −20 °C. Further purification of the 1-dephospho-lipid IVA was done by passing the material from the preparative TLC step through a 0.5-ml DEAE-cellulose column (Whatman DE-52), previously equilibrated as the acetate form in CHCl3, MeOH, H2O (2:3:1, v/v) (24Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Google Scholar, 36Raetz C.R.H. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol.

The above sample was redissolved in 12 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, H2O (2:3:1, v/v) and loaded onto the column. The flow-through was collected as one fraction. The column was washed with 1 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, H2O (2:3:1, v/v), and stepwise elution was achieved by including increasing ammonium acetate concentrations in the solvent mixture (24Que N.L.S. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28006-28016Google Scholar, 36Raetz C.R.H. Purcell S. Meyer M.V. Qureshi N. Takayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16080-16088Google Scholar). The column was thus successively washed with 2 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 30 mm aqueous NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v), 2 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 60 mm aqueous NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v), 4 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 120 mmaqueous NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v), 2 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 240 mm aqueous NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v), and finally with 2 ml of CHCl3, MeOH, 500 mmaqueous NH4Ac (2:3:1, v/v). 0.5-ml fractions were collected throughout. Elution of the lipid from the column was monitored by TLC using silica gel plates (5 × 10 cm), which were developed with the solvent CHCl3, pyridine, 887 formic acid, H2O (50:50:16:5, v/v). Some of the 1-dephospho-lipid IVA emerged from the column in the late CHCl3, MeOH, 60 mm NH4Ac wash, but most of the material eluted in the CHCl3, MeOH, 120 mmNH4Ac step. Only the fractions from the 120 mmwash were processed further as the source of 1-dephospho-lipid IVA substrate for in vitro incubations with theR. leguminosarum membranes. The selected fractions were pooled and converted into a two-phase Bligh-Dyer system, consisting of CHCl3, MeOH, H2O (2:2:1.8, v/v). The solvents were mixed and centrifuged for 8 min at room temperature in a clinical centrifuge. The upper phase was re-extracted once with a pre-equilibrated lower phase. The desired lower phases were then pooled and dried with a stream of N2. The purification yielded about 1.0 mg of 1-dephospho-lipid IVA. The 1H NMR analysis (2D COSY) of the final compound redissolved in 600 ॖl of CDCl3, CD3OD, D2O (2:3:1, v/v) and analyzed under the conditions described previously (42Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Res. Chem. 1999; 37: 620-630Google Scholar) confirmed its identity as 1-dephospho-lipid IVA (supplementary figure). The spectrum of the purified 1-dephospho-lipid IVA, which is referenced against internal tetramethylsilane, indicates that about 907 of the sample adopts the α-anomeric configuration in the proximal glucosamine unit, but the ॆ-anomer and its cross-peaks are also detected. Following NMR spectroscopy, the 1-dephospho-lipid IVA was dried down under N2 and resuspended in 750 ॖl of 50 mmMOPS, pH 7.0, to make a 1 mm aqueous dispersion. This was stored at −80 °C and subjected to brief sonic irradiation prior to use in assays. The starting material [4′-32P]lipid IVA was synthesized enzymatically as previously described (43Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Google Scholar) and then was converted into [4′-32P]1-dephospho-lipid IVA by hydrolysis in 0.1 m HCl. Typically, a sample containing ∼80–100 ॖCi of [4′-32P]lipid IVA was re-suspended in 150 ॖl of 0.1 m HCl. Following sonic irradiation for 2 min in a bath apparatus, the mixture was placed in a 100 °C heat block for 15 min. After cooling, the hydrolyzed material was centrifuged briefly and then spotted onto a 20 × 20-cm Silica gel plate. Preparative TLC was carried out as described above for the nonradiolabeled lipid IVA. After drying, the product was detected by a brief autoradiography and recovered by extraction from the silica chips (see above). The final substrate was typically dispersed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, such that the working stock solution contained ∼50,000 cpm/ॖl. The standard reaction mixture (10 ॖl) contained 10 ॖm[14C]B (∼500 cpm/reaction), 0.5–1.0 mg/ml membrane protein, 0.17 Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, unless otherwise indicated. The reactions were incubated under ambient conditions at 30 °C and terminated at the indicated times by spotting 4-ॖl samples onto a 20 × 20-cm silica gel TLC plate. The spots were dried for 30 min with a cold air stream, and the plate was then developed in the solvent CHCl3, MeOH, H2O/pyridine (40:25:4:2, v/v). The remaining substrate and product(s) were detected with a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager equipped with ImageQuant software. Enzyme specific activity (usually expressed as nmol/min/mg) was calculated based on the percentage of conversion of substrate to product(s). The standard reaction mixture (10 ॖl) contained 5–10 ॖm[4′-32P]1-dephospho-lipid IVA (∼5000 cpm/tube), 0.5–1 mg/ml membrane protein, 1 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, to partially suppress 4′ phosphatase activity. After incubation at 30 °C for the indicated times, the reactions were stopped by spotting 4-ॖl samples onto a 20 × 20-cm silica gel TLC plate. The plate was developed with the solvent CHCl3, pyridine, 887 formic acid, H2O (50:50:16:5, v/v) and imaged as described above.

Thr214 → Ala displayed a conspicuous 150-fold reduction of the apparent vanadate affinity for inhibition of ATPase activity, which could not simply be explained by the observed shifts of the conformational equilibria in favor of E 1 andE 1P. The intrinsic vanadate affinity of theE 2 form and the effect on the apparent vanadate affinity of displacement of theE 1–E 2 equilibrium were determined in a phosphorylation assay that allows the enzyme-vanadate complex to be formed under equilibrium conditions. When theE 2 form prevailed, Thr214 → Ala retained a reduced vanadate affinity relative to wild type, whereas the affinity of Gly263 → Ala became wild type-like. Thus, mutation of Thr214 affected the intrinsic affinity ofE 2 for vanadate. Furthermore, Thr214 → Ala showed at least a 5-fold reducedE 2P dephosphorylation rate relative to wild type in the presence of saturating concentrations of K+ and Mg2+. Because vanadate is a phosphoryl transition state analog, it is proposed that defective binding of the phosphoryl transition state complex (transition state destabilization) causes the inability to catalyze E 2P dephosphorylation properly. By contrast, the phosphorylation site in theE 1 form was unaffected in Thr214→ Ala. Replacement of the glutamate, Glu216, of214TGES with alanine was incompatible with cell viability, indicating a very low transport activity or expression level. Our results support the hypothesis that domain A is isolated in the E 1 form, but contributes to make up the catalytic site in the E 2 and E 2P conformations.

K+-ATPase, the Na+- and K+-transporting adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.37) conformational states of the Na+,K+-ATPase phosphorylated conformational states ligand concentration giving half-maximum activation or inhibition putative transmembrane segments numbered from the NH2-terminal end of the peptide chain The Na+,K+-ATPase1maintains high Na+ and K+ gradients across the plasma membrane in all animal cells by mediating active transport of Na+ out and K+ into the cell at a stoichiometry of 3:2, using the energy derived from hydrolysis of ATP (1Glynn I.M. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 3. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 35-114Google Scholar). The reaction steps linking ion transport to ATP hydrolysis through conformational changes are described by the consecutive “Post-Albers” or “E 1–E 2” model depicted in Scheme 1 (2Albers R.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 727-756Google Scholar, 3Post R.L. Kume S. Tobin T. Orcutt B. Sen A.K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 54: 306s-326sGoogle Scholar, 4Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Google Scholar). The Na+,K+-ATPase is a member of the family of P-type ATPases, which include among others the Ca2+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase, and for which autophosphorylation by ATP of an aspartyl residue is a characteristic feature of the reaction cycle. In the Na+,K+-ATPase, the phosphorylation reaction is triggered by binding of three cytoplasmic Na+ ions to theE 1 form of the enzyme, and dephosphorylation is activated by the binding of K+ to extracellularly facing sites. The translocation of Na+ occurs in connection with a conformational change in the phosphoenzyme,E 1P(Na3) →E 2P transition. The countertransport of K+ is associated with the dephosphorylation ofE 2P and another conformational change,E 2(K2) →E 1, which deoccludes K+ at the cytoplasmic side and is accelerated by binding of ATP (Scheme 1). To understand the mechanism of cation transport, it is essential to elucidate the nature of the conformational changes and the catalytic events, as well as the links between them. The high-resolution crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase in the E 1Ca2 state (5Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar) shows that the protein is comprised by 10 membrane-spanning segments, M1–M10, and a cytoplasmic part consisting of three distinct main domains:A for actuator, N for nucleotide binding, andP for phosphorylation (i.e. containing the phosphorylated aspartate residue). The overall structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase α-subunit resembles that of Ca2+-ATPase (6Sweadner K.J. Donnet C. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 685-704Google Scholar, 7Hebert H. Purhonen P. Vorum H. Thomsen K. Maunsbach A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 479-494Google Scholar), and many residues, including those known to be involved in ion binding and catalysis (8Lingrel J.B. Kuntzweiler T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19659-19662Google Scholar, 9MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar, 10Vilsen B. Ramlov D. Andersen J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Google Scholar, 13Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Google Scholar), are highly conserved between these two pump proteins. The most conserved sequences 2All numbering of Na+,K+-ATPase residues in this article refers to the sequence of the rat α1 isoform. among P-type pumps are 371DKTGT (containing the phosphorylated aspartate),610MVTGD, and 710TGDGVNDS, within domainP, and 214TGES in domain A (12, 13). A number of studies have suggested that 214TGES plays an important role in energy transduction. Proximity relations determined by specific affinity cleavage have indicated that 214TGES moves toward domain P during the E 1→ E 2(K2) andE 1P(Na3) →E 2P transitions, thereby displacing domainN from domain P (14). It was hypothesized that the E 1P(Na3) →E 2P conformational transition is associated with a change in Mg2+ ligation, and that the glutamic acid residue of 214TGES is involved in Mg2+coordination in E 2P, but not inE 1P(Na3) (14Goldshleger R. Patchornik G. Shimon M.B. Tal D.M. Post R.L. Karlish S.J.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 387-399Google Scholar). Previous mutagenesis analysis of the Ca2+-ATPase has implicated each of the residues TGE of the conserved TGES sequence in theE 1P(Ca2) →E 2P transition (15Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Google Scholar). Other residues in domainA have also been shown by mutagenesis to be involved in theE 2(K2) → E 1and E 1P(Na3) →E 2P transitions of the Na+,K+-ATPase. Hence, mutation of Glu233 in the Na+,K+-ATPase accelerated the E 2(K2) →E 1 transition of the dephosphoenzyme (16Boxenbaum N. Daly S.E. Javaid Z.Z. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23086-23092Google Scholar), and mutation of Gly263 located in the loop connecting domainA with M3 (see Fig. 1) interfered with both E 2(K2) →E 1 andE 1P(Na3) →E 2P (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar). Similar effects were seen for mutation of the corresponding residue in the Ca2+-ATPase, Gly233 (18Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennen D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar, 19Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Google Scholar). Moreover, the results of proteolytic cleavage studies are consistent with large domain motions in the cytoplasmic region, involving rotation of domain A, in connection with the conformational changes (20Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar, 21Møller J.V. Lenoir G. Marchand C. Montigny C. Le Maire M. Toyoshima C. Juul B.S. Champeil P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38647-38659Google Scholar, 22Jørgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Google Scholar, 23Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Collins J.H. Jørgensen P.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 93: 85-92Google Scholar). Very recently, the crystal structure of the Ca2+-ATPase in the Ca2+-free E 2 state revealed that large movements of the three cytoplasmic domains occur during the transition from E 1Ca2 toE 2, leading to formation of a compact headpiece in the E 2 state, where the threonine of the TGES sequence is located at the interface between the A andP domains close to the phosphorylated aspartate and other catalytically important residues, see Fig. 1 (24Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar). This could mean that the threonine plays a role in the catalytic function ofE 2 and E 2P. In the present study, the functional role of Thr214 of the Na+,K+-ATPase was examined by replacement with alanine. To analyze both the conformational changes and the function of the catalytic site in the mutant, we have conducted rapid kinetic measurements of phosphorylation, as well as dephosphorylation. In addition, the affinity for the phosphate transition state analog vanadate was determined both during enzyme turnover and at equilibrium under conditions where the E 2 form prevails. The results show that Thr214 is important for proper function of the catalytic site in E 2 andE 2P, whereas the catalytic site of theE 1 form seems to function normally in the Thr214 → Ala mutant. The effects of the Thr214 → Ala mutation presented here add functional evidence to the hypothesis that domain A contributes substantially to make up the catalytic site in theE 2 and E 2P conformations. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar) of the cDNA encoding the ouabain-insensitive rat α1-isoform of Na+,K+-ATPase, expression of mutants and wild type in COS-1 cells, using 5 μm ouabain in the growth medium to select stable transfectants, and the isolation of crude plasma membranes from the cells were carried out as described previously (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Google Scholar), and the concentration of total protein was determined using the dye binding method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured on sodium deoxycholate- or alamethicin-treated leaky plasma membranes at 37 °C as described previously (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Google Scholar). Titration of the ouabain concentration dependence of the ATPase activity gave similar K 0.5 values for the wild type (132 ± 8 μm) and the mutant (95 ± 28 μm). The fraction of active Na+,K+-ATPase molecules in the preparation contributed by the exogenous enzyme calculated as in Ref. 29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Google Scholar was 92% for the wild type and 95% for the mutant, indicating that only a minimal amount of endogenous COS-1 cell enzyme was present. To eliminate the contribution of the latter, 10 μm ouabain was added to all assays. The Na+,K+-ATPase activity associated with the expressed exogenous enzyme was calculated by subtracting the ATPase activity measured at a concentration of ouabain (10 mm) that inhibits all Na+,K+-ATPase activity from that measured at 10 μm ouabain. Studies of the Na+ dependence of steady-state phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and the time course of ADP-dependent dephosphorylation, and the determination of the active site concentration by phosphorylation in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin (20 μg/ml) to inhibit dephosphorylation were carried out at 0 °C as previously described (30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Google Scholar). Deocclusion of K+ was generally studied in phosphorylation experiments at 10 °C, following formation of K+-occluded enzyme at room temperature as previously described (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar, 29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Google Scholar, 31Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Google Scholar). To prevent dephosphorylation, oligomycin was added prior to initiation of phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP (31Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Google Scholar). In addition, some deocclusion experiments were performed in the same way, but at 0 °C in the presence of final concentrations of 5 μm[γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EGTA, 20 μg/ml oligomycin, and 10 μm ouabain, following incubation at 20 °C for 30 min with 8 mm RbCl, to mimic the conditions prevailing in the vanadate binding assay described below. In all cases, background phosphorylation was determined in the presence of 50 mm KCl without NaCl. To examine the vanadate affinity under equilibrium conditions, 10 μg of deoxycholate-treated plasma membranes were incubated at 20 °C for 30 min in 40 μl of medium containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μm ouabain, and the indicated concentration of orthovanadate. To promote accumulation of the enzyme in the E 2 form, 8 mm RbCl was added to the medium during the incubation with vanadate. The samples were then cooled to 0 °C to prevent dissociation of bound vanadate (32Smith R.L. Zinn K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9852-9859Google Scholar), and the enzyme fraction with no vanadate bound was determined by measuring the amount of phosphoenzyme formed during a 30-s incubation following the addition of 360 μl of ice-cold phosphorylation medium producing final concentrations of 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm choline chloride, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 20 μg/ml oligomycin. The data were fitted by assuming a simple one-site binding model, where only the enzyme fraction with no vanadate bound phosphorylates, EP=(EPmax−EP∞)·(1−[vanadate]/(K0.5+[vanadate]))+EP∞Equation 1 EPmax is the phosphorylation level obtained in the absence of vanadate, and EP∞corresponds to infinite vanadate concentration. To perform rapid kinetic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation experiments at 25 °C, a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) was used as previously described (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar). The phosphorylation rate of enzyme present in the Na+-saturated form was determined in single-mixing experiments carried out as previously described according to “Protocol 1” (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar, 33Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Google Scholar). To monitor the rate of theE 1P → E 2P transition or the dephosphorylation of E 2P, a double-mixing procedure was used to study dephosphorylation of phosphoenzyme formed either in the presence of 600 mm NaCl to accumulateE 1P (“Protocol 2a”) or in the presence of 20 mm NaCl and 130 mm choline chloride to accumulate E 2P (“Protocol 2b”) (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar, 33Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Google Scholar). The time course of dephosphorylation of E 1P was analyzed using the equation describing the kinetics of two consecutive first-order reactions E 1P →E 2P → E 2 with rate constants k 1 and k 2, respectively,EPt=[E1P]+[E2P]=EP0·k2k2−k1e−k1t−k1k2−k1e−k2tEquation 2 where EPt is the phosphorylation level at time t and EP0 is the initial phosphorylation level. Data normalization, averaging, and nonlinear regression analysis were carried out as previously (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar). The lines in the figures show the best fit to the complete set of normalized data with the error bars shown for each data point corresponding to the standard error. Ligand dependences were analyzed by applying the Hill equation (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar), and the time course of K+ deocclusion by use of the biexponential equation described previously (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar). Thr214 of the rat kidney Na+,K+-ATPase was replaced with alanine, and the resulting enzyme was expressed in COS-1 cells under ouabain selective pressure as previously (26Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 301-307Google Scholar, 27Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13340-13349Google Scholar). The Thr214 → Ala mutant was able to confer ouabain resistance to the cells, indicating that the mutant is able to transport Na+ and K+ at rates compatible with cell growth. Thr214→ Ala was expressed to a level very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (about 60 pmol/mg of total membrane protein determined as the maximum phosphoenzyme level, EPmax, see below and Refs. 30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Google Scholar and 33Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Google Scholar), allowing the effects of this mutation on the overall and partial reaction steps of the enzyme cycle to be analyzed. Transfection was also carried out with Glu216 → Ala, but this mutant failed to confer ouabain resistance to the cells, indicating that the transport activity or the expression level of this mutant is too low to maintain cell viability. Titration of the Na+, K+, and ATP dependence of ATPase activity of Thr214 → Ala showed a slightly increased apparent affinity for Na+ (1.5-fold), a slightly decreased apparent affinity for K+ (1.2-fold), and a 3.3-fold increase in apparent affinity for ATP, relative to wild type (Fig. 2 and Table I). Because the E 1form binds Na+ and ATP with high affinity, but K+ with low affinity, and the E 2form binds K+ with high affinity and ATP with low affinity, the effects of the mutation on the apparent Na+, K+, and ATP affinities are compatible with a shift of theE 1–E 2 conformational equilibrium of the dephosphoenzyme in favor ofE 1.Table IComparison of conformational equilibria of wild type, Thr214→ Ala, and Gly263 → AlaMutationK 0.5(Na+)K 0.5(K+)K 0.5(ATP)E 2(K2)Deocclusion rateE 1P/E 2PE 1P → E 2P ratemm%s −1%s −1Wild type8.8aFrom Fig. 2.0.66aFrom Fig. 2.0.36aFrom Fig. 2.96bFrom Fig. 6.0.008bFrom Fig. 6.20/80cFrom Fig. 8.138dFrom Fig. 10.Thr214 → Ala5.9aFrom Fig. 2.0.80aFrom Fig. 2.0.11aFrom Fig. 2.82bFrom Fig. 6.0.032bFrom Fig. 6.40/60cFrom Fig. 8.57dFrom Fig. 10.Gly263 → AlaeData from Ref. 17, obtained under the same conditions as used for the present paper.5.10.860.06460.18775/2528a From Fig. 2.b From Fig. 6.c From Fig. 8.d From Fig. 10.e Data from Ref. 17Toustrup-Jensen M.

Open table in a new tab The maximal catalytic turnover rate of the Na+,K+-ATPase was estimated as the ratio between V max for ATP hydrolysis and the active site concentration, determined as the maximum phosphoenzyme level,EPmax, measured at 0 °C by phosphorylation with ATP in the presence of 150 mm NaCl and oligomycin to inhibit dephosphorylation. A value of 3225 ± 262 min−1 was found for Thr214 → Ala,i.e. about 38% of the turnover rate of 8474 ± 165 min−1 determined for the wild type (30Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13312-13324Google Scholar, 33Toustrup-Jensen M. Vilsen B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38607-38617Google Scholar). Vanadate is considered an analog of the phosphoryl transition state and binds specifically to E 2and E 2(K2), leading to an inhibited dead-end state that probably resembles theE 2·P complex from which phosphate is released (34Cantley Jr., L.C. Cantley L.G. Josephson L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7361-7368Google Scholar). Fig. 3 shows titration of the vanadate inhibition of steady-state Na+,K+-ATPase activity in the presence of 20 mm K+, i.e. a condition facilitating vanadate inhibition in the wild type. Relative to the wild type, the mutant Thr214 → Ala displayed a conspicuous 150-fold reduction of the apparent affinity for vanadate in the ATPase assay. This suggests either that the steady-state level of the vanadate-reactive E 2 conformation was depleted or the intrinsic affinity for vanadate reduced in the mutant. To reveal the Na+ affinity at the cytoplasmically facing Na+sites without interference from K+, the Na+dependence of phosphorylation from ATP was studied in the absence of K+ and presence of oligomycin to inhibit dephosphorylation (Fig. 4). Relative to wild type, the apparent affinity for Na+ was slightly increased (1.6-fold) in Thr214 → Ala, in line with the above described increase in the apparent affinity for Na+ in measurement of Na+,K+-ATPase activity. To test the phosphorylation reactionE 1Na3 →E 1P(Na3) and the ATP affinity of theE 1Na3 form, the time course of phosphorylation with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP was studied in the presence of oligomycin (Fig.5), using a quench-flow module QFM-5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The observed rate constant,k obs, was 32 s−1 for Thr214 → Ala, i.e. very similar to that of the wild-type enzyme (29 s−1). In the presence of 2 μm ATP, the phosphorylation reaction is less than half-saturated in the wild type (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar), and, accordingly, any difference between mutant and wild type with respect to the affinity ofE 1Na3 for ATP should be reflected in the k obs value. Hence, the result of the phosphorylation experiment suggests that in Thr214 → Ala the phosphorylation reaction as well as the binding of ATP toE 1Na3 is wild type-like. To examine the amount of K+-occluded enzyme at equilibrium and the rate of the K+ deocclusion reactionE 2(K2) → E 1+ 2K+, the previously described phosphorylation assay was applied (Fig. 6) (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar, 29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Google Scholar, 31Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Google Scholar). Following formation of the K+-occluded complex in the presence of 8 mm K+, the phosphorylation was monitored upon a 10-fold dilution of the enzyme in a solution containing 1 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 100 mmNa+. As previously described for the wild type and other mutants (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar, 29Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11389-11400Google Scholar, 31Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10961-10971Google Scholar), the time course of phosphorylation can be analyzed as a biphasic time function, in which the component corresponding to the rapid phase is at maximum from the beginning, because it reflects the nonoccluded E 1 enzyme pool that binds Na+ and phosphorylates within 5 s. The slow phase (shown by the lines in Fig. 6) reflects the phosphorylation of E 2(K2) through the steps E 2(K2) →E 1 → E 1Na3→ E 1P(Na3), where the release of occluded K+ is rate-limiting. The fitting procedure allows extraction of the rate constant corresponding to the slow phase and the amplitude of the slow phase (100% minus the ordinate intercept), corresponding to the relative amount of enzyme initially present asE 2(K2). These parameters are shown in Table I. Relative to wild type, the Thr214 → Ala mutant showed a 4-fold increase of the rate of release of occluded K+, and the relative amount ofE 2(K2) was 82% in the mutantversus 96% in the wild type. The 150-fold reduction of the apparent affinity for vanadate determined in the ATPase assay may in principle arise from a direct effect of the mutation on the vanadate-binding site (a change to the “intrinsic” affinity for vanadate) or be secondary to changes in the rates of reactions in the enzyme cycle preceding and subsequent to the vanadate-reactiveE 2 conformation, which would affect the accumulation of E 2 at steady state and, thereby, the sensitivity to inhibition by vanadate. To be able to distinguish between these possibilities, we have adopted a phosphorylation assay that allows the enzyme-vanadate complex to be formed under equilibrium conditions, where E 2 is not being continuously produced by dephosphorylation of E 2P as during enzyme cycling. The enzyme is equilibrated with various concentrations of vanadate at 20 °C in the absence of ATP, and the vanadate-free enzyme fraction is determined by its ability to form a phosphoenzyme with [γ-32P]ATP after cooling to 0 °C. Vanadate binding is competitive with phosphorylation, and because the dissociation of vanadate is very slow at 0 °C (32Smith R.L. Zinn K. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9852-9859Google Scholar), the amount of phosphoenzyme formed in this assay reflects the equilibrium between the free and vanadate-bound enzyme forms existing during the equilibration with vanadate at 20 °C before the addition of [γ-32P]ATP. Results obtained with this assay are shown in Fig.7 and summarized in Table II. Generally, the vanadate affinity reported here is higher than that determined during enzyme turnover with ATP. This is probably because of the lack of competition from ATP binding and phosphorylation during the equilibration with vanadate.Table IIEquilibrium binding affinities for vanadate determined in phosphorylation experimentsMutationK 0.5(vanadate)−Rb++Rb+nmWild type42aFrom Fig. 7 A.12bFrom Fig. 7 B.Thr214 → Ala334aFrom Fig. 7 A.48bFrom Fig. 7 B.Gly263 → Ala932aFrom Fig. 7 A.15bFrom Fig. 7 B.a From Fig. 7 A.b From Fig. 7 B. Open table in a new tab Fig. 7 A shows results obtained following equilibration with vanadate in the absence of any of the transported cations. Under these conditions, Thr214 → Ala exhibited 8-fold reduction of the apparent affinity for vanadate relative to wild type. A change in this direction could in principle arise from a mutational effect shifting the E 1–E 2conformational equilibrium of the dephosphoenzyme in favor ofE 1, and, indeed, there is evidence for such a shift from the changes to the apparent affinities for Na+, K+, and ATP, as well as the rate of the K+deocclusion reaction and the equilibrium level ofE 2(K2) presented above, although the changes to these parameters were relatively small (see Table I). For comparison, Fig. 7 also shows vanadate inhibition results obtained with the previously characterized mutant Gly263 → Ala (17Toustrup-Jensen M. Hauge M. Vilsen B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5521-5532Google Scholar) that exhibited more pronounced changes than Thr214 → Ala with respect to the parameters characterizing the conformational equilibrium (cf. Table I). As seen in Fig. 1, Gly263 is located in the loop connecting domainA with M3. The corresponding glycine in the Ca2+-ATPase undergoes a large movement in relation to theE 1–E 2 transition, but unlike the threonine does not approach the phosphorylated aspartate. In accordance with a more pronounced shift of the conformational equilibrium in favor of E 1 in Gly263→ Ala as compared with Thr214 → Ala, the apparent affinity for vanadate observed in the absence of the transported cations (Fig. 7 A) was also reduced more in Gly263 → Ala (22-fold reduction relative to wild type) than in Thr214 → Ala. An important question was, however, whether the relatively small change to the E 1–E 2conformational equilibrium of Thr214 → Ala indicated by the above mentioned parameters (Table I) is sufficient to account for the 8-fold reduction in apparent vanadate affinity observed in the equilibrium binding assay. To eliminate the influence of the shift ofE 1–E 2 equilibrium induced by the mutation, the vanadate titration was also performed in the presence of 8 mm Rb+ (Fig. 7 B). As seen in the inset to Fig. 7 B, measurements of occlusion and deocclusion of Rb+, carried out according to the same principles as for Fig. 6, but under the same conditions as applied in the vanadate binding assay, showed that in the presence of 8 mm Rb+, the amount ofE 2(Rb2) present was close to 100% for both mutants and the wild type (see legend to Fig. 7). Themain part of Fig. 7 B shows that under these conditions the affinity of Gly263 → Ala for vanadate was wild type-like, as would be expected for a “conformati"

DNA-binding domain ligand-binding domain retinoid X receptor thyroid receptors direct repeats small-angle x-ray scattering dithiothreitol dummy atom model cellular retinol-binding protein The nuclear receptor gene family in humans consists of at least 48 structurally related proteins that regulate transcription of target genes (1Maglich J.M.

These include receptors for the steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoids, vitamin D, prostaglandins, fatty acids, and unknown ligands, the orphan receptors. Nuclear receptors are comprised of single polypeptide chains that contain modular domains (2Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 3Lazar M.A. Endocr.

The N termini of the receptors, which are the most variable in length, have transcription transactivation functions. The centrally placed and highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD)1 directs receptor binding to DNA and is also involved in dimerization. The carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain (LBD) binds the ligand and undergoes ligand-induced conformational changes that promote dissociation of corepressors and association of coactivators that mediate receptor-induced changes in transcriptional control. The LBD also participates in receptor homodimerization, heterodimerization, and oligomerization (5Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Ann. Rev.

The three RXR isoforms (α, β, and γ) bind to 9-cis retinoic acid and can function either as homodimers or heterodimers with many other members of the nuclear receptor family, including the receptors for thyroid hormones (TRs), vitamin D, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors. RXR homodimers bind preferentially to direct repeats (DRs) of the AGGTCA half-site spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1), whereas heterodimers with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, vitamin D receptors, TRs, and retinoic acid receptors bind to DRs spaced by 1, 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides, respectively. The RXR has been reported to exist either as a mixed population of monomers, dimers, and tetramers (14Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gromemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-18721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or monomers and tetramers (15Chen Z.-P. Iyer J. Bourguet W. Held P. Mioskowski C. Lebeau L. Chambon P. Gromemeyer H. J.

In the absence of ligand, the values forK d monomer→dimer andK d dimer→tetramer are 130 and 2.8 nm, respectively, as calculated from fluorescence anisotropy titration studies, indicating that in this setting tetramer formation is favored (14Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gromemeyer H. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13717-18721Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Addition of ligand to tetramers in solution leads to their rapid dissociation to form homodimers (14Kersten S. Pan L. Chambon P. Gromemeyer H. Noy N.

Addition of DR-1 DNA to tetramer-containing solutions leads to formation of dimers. Thus, both ligand and the RXR cognate DNA element shift the dynamic equilibrium between RXR tetramer and dimer so that dimer formation is enhanced. A large number of isolated nuclear receptor DBD and LBD structures have been obtained in crystal and in solution. The RXRα DBD has been solved in complexes with DNA as homodimers and as heterodimers with the TR DBD and retinoic acid receptor DBD (16Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S.

The LBDs are mostly α-helical with the ligand buried in the interior of the holo-receptor and contributing to formation of the hydrophobic core of the protein. There are significant structural differences between the RXR LBD apo- and holo-forms. In particular, transactivation helix (H12) protrudes from the body of the receptor in the absence of ligand, but packs against the body of receptor in its presence (19Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P.

The RXR LBD dimer interface overlaps residues from the intersection of helices 7, 9, and 10 (21) and corresponds to the position of the TR homo- and heterodimerization interface as defined by site-directed mutagenesis (26Ribeiro R.C.J.

A crystal structure of an RXR-LBD tetramer, along with solution x-ray scattering studies of the same oligomer (21Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E.

This extensive tetramer interface is thought to contribute to the marked stability of this oligomer (27Kersten S. Pan L. Noy N. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14263-14269Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Comparison of the liganded homodimer structure with the tetramer structure also suggests a reason for the observed ligand-dependent dissociation of tetramers to dimer pairs. Each of the constituent LBDs of the tetramer adopts the typical apo-receptor conformation, in which H12 protrudes from the body of the LBD but then, instead of protruding away from the receptor, actually docks into the H3-H5 hydrophobic cleft region in the adjacent dimer utilizing its LMEML sequence that resembles the coactivator LXXLL motif (21Gampe Jr., R.T. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Wisely G.B. Milburn M.V. Xu H.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2229-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since ligand repositions H12, addition of ligand to tetramers would be expected to remove this part of the interdimer interface and destabilize the tetramer. While each of these crystal structures has provided major insights into receptor function, it will be necessary to understand the relationships between distinct receptor domains to completely understand how nuclear receptors work. For example, it is not clear why the RXR dimer binds DR-1 elements with higher affinity than the tetramer. The structures of any nuclear receptor containing multiple domains have not yet been solved. In this study, we report the structural organization of a hRXR protein containing the linked DBD and LBD (hRXRαΔAB) as revealed by solution synchrotron x-ray scattering studies. We used the available crystallographic structures of the isolated hRXRα DBD and LBD domains to place them inside low resolution ab initio small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) models, which allowed us to assemble models of both a dimer and a tetramer of hRXRαΔAB. The results show that the dimer is a U-shaped molecule with the two DBDs in close proximity (2 nm) forming the tips of the U and separated by an angle of 10°. By contrast, the tetramer is a more elongated X-shaped molecule formed by two dimers in head to head arrangement in which the DBDs are extended from the structure and further apart (6 nm) than in the dimer configuration and are separated by an angle of ∼30°. These solution structures represent the first x-ray structural studies of nuclear receptors that contain more than one domain and may explain why RXR dimers recognize target genes with higher affinity than tetramers. The hRXRαΔAB construct encompassing amino acid residues 126–462 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells from strain BL21(DE3) harboring a pET28a(+) plasmid (Novagen). A Luria broth (LB) starter culture was inoculated with a single colony of a LB-agar culture and grown overnight at 37 °C. The initial culture was inoculated at 1% in a 2× YT culture (1.6% tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl w/v) and grown at 37 °C in 50 μg/ml kanamycin medium untilA 600 nm reached 0.8. Then 5 μm of zinc sulfate and 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the culture was allowed to grow for 2 h of incubation at 37 °C. After this cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellets were resuspended in 10 ml/liter culture of buffer A (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysozyme were added to 1 mm and 220 μg/ml, respectively, and the culture was placed on ice for 30 min. The lysate was sonicated for six times in 1-min intervals (power 40, Branson Sonifier 450), keeping the culture on ice, and then clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 rpm in a Sorval SS34 rotor. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1.5-ml (per liter culture) Talon Superflow Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) packed in a c10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in buffer A (flow rate 70 cm/h). The column was washed with buffer A, until theA 280 nm of the eluent returned to baseline, and then subsequently with buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole). Then, buffer A was applied until the conductivity returned to that expected for the buffer A. The protein was eluted with buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing hRXRαΔAB were pooled, diluted 1:1 with a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT (dithiothreitol), and 0.5 mm EDTA. The fractions were then loaded onto Q-Sepharose High Performance Resin (7 ml, Amersham Biosciences) and packed in a c10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) (1 × 10 cm, flow rate 70 cm/h) that had been pre-equilibrated with this same buffer (plus 50 mm NaCl). The column was then washed with 10 ml of a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA to remove unbound protein and eluted with a gradient of 50–500 mmNaCl. The protein eluted in two peaks, and the fractions of each peak were pooled and concentrated. Protein content and purity of all chromatographic fractions were checked by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Protein concentrations were determined in parallel using the Bio-Rad dye assay and bovine serum albumin as standard. The protein oligomerization state was assessed by size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering. Each of two protein elution peaks was separately concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Biosciences). The column was pre-equilibrated with a buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and standardized with the molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) using 100 μl of protein standard samples of a known Stokes radii (thyroglobulin, 8.5 nm; ferritin, 6.1 nm; catalase, 5.22 nm; aldolase, 4.81 nm; bovine serum albumin, 3.55 nm; ovalbumin, 3.05 nm; chymotrypsinogen, 2.09 nm, and ribonuclease A, 1.64 nm). The different oligomeric forms of RXRαΔAB receptor were analyzed under the same conditions. The initial protein concentrations of 2.2, 5.6, and 12.3 mg/ml (peak 1) and 3, 8.2, and 11 mg/ml (peak 2) were studied. Dynamic light scattering measurements were performed with a DynaPro MS200 instrument (Protein Solutions) at 4 °C using a 12-μl cuvette. The protein samples were concentrated to 1.17 and 7 mg/ml (separately peak 1 and peak 2) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mm DTT prior to measurements. SAXS data were collected at the small-angle scattering beamline on the LNLS (National Synchrotron Light Laboratory, Campinas, Brazil) using one-dimensional position-sensitive detector (28Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. et al.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar). hRXRα at the concentrations 2, 3.1, 6.3, and 14 mg/ml was measured at a wavelength λ = 0.138 nm for sample-detector distances of 632.5 and 1345.2 mm covering the momentum transfer range 0.1 < q < 6 nm−1 (q= 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle). The scattering curves of the protein solutions and the corresponding solvents were collected in a number of short 30-s to 1-min frames to monitor radiation damage and beam stability. The data were normalized to the intensity of the incident beam and corrected for detector response. The scattering of the buffer was subtracted, and the difference curves were scaled for concentration. The distance distribution functions p(r) and the radii of gyration R g were evaluated by the indirect Fourier transform program GNOM (29Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2985) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of the oligomers of hRXRα in solution were estimated by comparison of the extrapolated forward scattering I(0) with that of a reference solution of bovine serum albumin with a known molecular mass of 66 kDa. Prior to the shape analysis, a constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity at higher angles decays as q−4 following Porod's law for the homogeneous particles (30Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small-angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). The value of the constant is derived automatically from the outer part of the curve by linear fitting in coordinates q4I(0) versus q4 by the shape determination program DAMMIN (31Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). This procedure reduces the contribution from scattering due to the internal protein structure and yields an approximation of the “shape scattering” curve (i.e. scattering from the excluded volume of particle filled by constant density). The experimental pair distribution functions do not contain any negative part, which is an indication of the absence of interference effects in the scattering curves produced by spatial correlations. This argues that all solutions were sufficiently dilute to remove interference effects. The structure function that describes interparticle correlations may be equal to unity even at high concentrations for proteins of very anisotropic shape (32Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, NY1955Google Scholar). Low resolution particle shapes were restored from the experimental SAXS data using two ab initioprocedures. In the first procedure (33Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Sturmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 34Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Sturmann H.B. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 798-802Crossref Google Scholar), the shape is represented by an angular envelope function, parameterized in terms of spherical harmonics using multipole expansion methods (35Sturmann H.B. J. Phys. Chem. 1970; 72: 177-182Google Scholar). The maximum number of the spherical harmonics L is selected to keep the number of free parameters M = (L + 1) − 6 close to the number of Shannon channels N s= D max q max/π in the experimental data (36Shannon C.E. Weaver W. The Mathematical Theory of Communication. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL1949Google Scholar). The computed scattering intensity of the envelope is compared with the experimentally obtained one. The envelope is modified by minimizing the discrepancy χ between the calculated and the experimental data (36Shannon C.E. Weaver W. The Mathematical Theory of Communication. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL1949Google Scholar,37Svergun D.I. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 736-744Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The discrepancy χ is defined in Equation 1, χ=1N−1∑j=1NI(qj)−Iexp(qj)ς(qj)2Equation 1 where N is a number of the experimental points and I exp(qj ) is the experimental intensity and ς(qj ) is its standard deviation in the jth point. The shapes of the hRXRα dimers and tetramers were also restored from the experimental data using another ab initio method as implemented in DAMMIN (31Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). A sphere of diameterD max was filled by a regular grid of points corresponding to a dense hexagonal packing of small spheres (dummy atoms) of radius r 0 ≪D max. The structure of the dummy atom model (DAM) is defined by a configuration X, assigning an index to each atom corresponding to solvent (0) or solute particle (1Maglich J.M. Sluder A. Guan X. Shi Y. McKee D.D. Carrick K. Kamdar K. Willson T.M. Moore J.T. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 1-7Crossref Google Scholar). The method searches for a compact interconnected configurationX, minimizing the goal function in Equation 2, f(X)=χ2+αP(X)Equation 2 where α > 0 is the weight of the looseness penalty (31Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Starting from the initial spherical configuration, simulated annealing is employed for the minimization (31Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Both models assume that the protein structure in solution can be described by a constant electron density over its whole volume. However, short range fluctuations in electronic density that exist inside the proteins actually yield a constant contribution at smallq. To apply SASHA and DAMMIN this constant contribution should be previously subtracted from the experimental scattering curves. The assumption of a two-electron density model (corresponding to the protein and the solvent) is progressively weaker for increasingq outside the range covered in the present measurements. The coordinate sets for both hRXRα LBD and DBD domains were obtained from Protein Data Bank (PDB accession numbers 1G1U and 2NLL) (16Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 19Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Relative positions of the LBD and DBD domains were found by iterative rotation of their envelope functions to minimize the discrepancy with the ab initio low resolution structure using an automated procedure. The models were displayed using the program MASSHA (38Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Radii of gyration (R g), maximum intraparticle distances (D max), envelop functions, and scattering curves, were calculated from these atomic coordinates with use of the program CRYSOL taking into account the influence of the hydration shell (39Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). SUPCOMB (40Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1093) Google Scholar) was used to superimpose ab initio low resolution models with crystallographic structures. The bacterially expressed hRXRαΔAB preparation eluted from the Q-Sepharose high performance resin ion exchange column in two peaks (1 and 2; see “Material and Methods”). The protein of both chromatographic fractions migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels at a molecular weight that is consistent with hRXRαΔAB region at high purity (>95%; “Material and Methods”). Thus, our preparation of hRXRαΔAB exists in two distinct forms. To assess the structural organization of the hRXRαΔAB in solution, separate synchrotron SAXS measurements were performed on each peak. Experimental scattering curves from hRXRα are presented in Fig.1, and the structural parameters derived from these curves are given in TableI.Table IStructural parameters derived from SAXS dataParameter/SamplehRXR α dimerhRXR α tetramerExp.1-aExp., calculated from the experimental data.Env.1-bEnv., parameters of the envelope models.DAM1-cDAM, parameters of the dummy atoms models averaged over 10 models.Exp.Env.DAMMass (kDa)79 (5)185 (10)D max(nm)11.5 (5)12.011.0 (2)19 (1)2018 (2)R g(nm)3.38 (5)3.413.36 (1)5.27 (4)5.275.2 (2)V(nm3)105151119 (5)1-dSymmetry P2 imposed.246338285 (3)Free parameters6.71-eNumber of Shannon channels is given.131-dSymmetry P2 imposed.271814.11-eNumber of Shannon channels is given.311-fSymmetry P222 imposed.3884Discrepancy χ0.571.32 (1)0.991.30 (2)Resolution (nm)3.03.33.01.0522.11-a Exp., calculated from the experimental data.1-b Env., parameters of the envelope models.1-c DAM, parameters of the dummy atoms models averaged over 10 models.1-d Symmetry P2 imposed.1-e Number of Shannon channels is given.1-f Symmetry P222 imposed. Open table in a new tab The hRXRαΔAB oligomers eluted in peaks 1 and 2 correspond to molecular masses of 79 and 185 kDa, respectively, as determined in SAXS experiments by comparison with a reference solution of bovine serum albumin (Table I). This suggests that peaks 1 and 2 are composed respectively of hRXRαΔAB dimers and tetramers. Further support for this finding comes from the size exclusion chromatography analysis (Fig. 2). Peak 1 protein Stokes radius was equal to 4.48 and 4.66 nm at protein concentrations of 5.6 and 12.3 mg/ml, respectively. Peak 2 protein Stokes radius varied from 5.2 to 5.7 nm at several protein concentrations between 3 and 11 mg/ml. Dynamic light scattering experiments conducted on peak 1 and peak 2 fractions at the concentrations 1.2 and 7 mg/ml gave, respectively, experimental Stokes radii of 4.42 and 4.3 nm for peak 1 and 5.13 and 5.42 nm for peak 2. These results are both consistent with the idea that peaks 1 and 2 represent dimer and tetramer, respectively. Determinations of Stokes radius from size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering agree with Stokes radii calculated from proposed low resolution SAXS models of the hRXRαΔAB dimer and tetramer (see below), which are 4.15 nm for dimer and 5.6 nm for tetramer (41Garcia de la Torre J. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1670268905,"Abstract The yeast transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC) is organized in two distinct multisubunit domains, τA and τB, that are respectively responsible for TFIIIB assembly and stable anchoring of TFIIIC on the B block of tRNA genes. Surprisingly, we found that the removal of τA by mild proteolysis stabilizes the residual τB·DNA complexes at high temperatures. Focusing on the well conserved τ95 subunit that belongs to the τA domain, we found that the τ95-E447K mutation has long distance effects on the stability of TFIIIC·DNA complexes and start site selection. Mutant TFIIIC·DNA complexes presented a shift in their 5′ border, generated slow-migrating TFIIIB·DNA complexes upon stripping TFIIIC by heparin or heat treatment, and allowed initiation at downstream sites. In addition, mutant TFIIIC·DNA complexes were highly unstable at high temperatures. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that τ95 participates in the interconnection of τA with τB via its contacts with τ138 and τ91 polypeptides. The results suggest that τ95 serves as a scaffold critical for τA·DNA spatial configuration and τB·DNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2017651210,"T-protein, a component of the glycine cleavage system, catalyzes a tetrahydrofolate-dependent reaction. Previously, we reported a conformational change of Escherichia coli T-protein upon interacting with E. coli H-protein (EH), showing an important role for the N-terminal region of the T-protein in the interaction. To further investigate the T-protein catalysis, the wild type (ET) and mutants were subjected to limited proteolysis. ET was favorably cleaved at Lys(81), Lys(154), Lys(288), and Lys(360) by lysylendopeptidase and the cleavages at Lys(81) and Lys(288) were strongly prevented by EH. Although ET was highly resistant to trypsinolysis, the mutant with an N-terminal 7-residue deletion (ETDelta7) was quite susceptible and instantly cleaved at Arg(16) accompanied by the rapid degradation of the resulting C-terminal fragment, indicating that the cleavage at Arg(16) is the trigger for the C-terminal fragmentation. EH showed no protection from the N-terminal cleavage, although substantial protection from the C-terminal fragmentation was observed. The replacement of Leu(6) of ET with alanine resulted in a similar sensitivity to trypsin as ETDelta7. These results suggest that the N-terminal region of ET functions as a molecular to hold ET in the compact form required for the proper association with EH. Leu(6) seems to play a central role in the hasp function. Interestingly, Lys(360) of ET was susceptible to proteolysis even after the stabilization of the entire molecule of ET by EH, indicating its location at the surface of the ET-EH complex. Together with the buried position of Lys(81) in the complex and previous results on folate binding sites, these results suggest the formation of a folate-binding cavity via the interaction of ET with EH. The polyglutamyl tail of the folate substrate may be inserted into the bosom of the cavity leaving the pteridine ring near the entrance of the cavity in the context of the catalytic reaction."

It is involved in a number of processes, including replication and transcription of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, chromosome segregation, and chromatin organization (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 665-697Google Scholar). Topo II is an important component of the kinetoplast-mitochondrion organelle of the kinetoplastid protozoa. These flagellates represent one of the most primitive groups of eukaryotes, equipped with a number of unique features. Their mitochondrial DNA, termed kinetoplast (k) DNA, contains up to 40% of total cellular DNA and is composed of thousands of minicircles and dozens of maxicircles. Maxicircles encode mitochondrial genes, the transcripts of which undergo extensive editing of the uridine insertion/deletion type. Minicircles bear guide RNA genes, which provide information for the editing process (for recent review see Refs. 2Estévez A.M. Simpson L. Gene. 1999; 240: 247-260Google Scholar and 3Gott J.M. Emeson R.B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2000; 34: 499-531Google Scholar). The order Kinetoplastida is divided into the suborder Bodonina, which comprises free-living commensalic or parasitic biflagellated species, and the suborder Trypanosomatina, members of which are equipped with a single flagellum and are obligatory parasitic. In the mitochondrion of Trypanosomatina, the DNA molecules are present as relaxed circles catenated into a single giant network (for recent review see Refs. 4Morris J.C. Drew M.E. Klingbeil M.M.

So far, topo II was studied in detail in the model trypanosomatids Crithidia fasciculata and Trypanosoma brucei, where it is involved in decatenation, replication, and recatenation of the kDNA minicircles (6Wang Z.

In primitive kinetoplastids that belong to the Bodonina, the kDNA is composed of either large circles (∼200 kb) bearing tandemly arranged minicircle-like sequences, as is the case in Trypanoplasma borreli (12Yasuhira S. Simpson L. RNA. 1996; 2: 1153-1160Google Scholar), or small circles (1.4–10.0-kb-long minicircles). InCryptobia helicis, these minicircles are supercoiled and non-catenated (13Lukeš J. Jirků M.

Englund P.T. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 495-502Google Scholar). Its minicircles encode classical guide RNA genes (14Blom D. de Haan A. van den Burg J. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1-15Google Scholar), which serve for editing of the maxicircle-located genes that have a novel order and editing pattern (19Blom D. de Haan A. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1205-1213Google Scholar). Due to their function, proper replication and segregation of minicircles is therefore critical for the survival of daughter cells. Insight into the role of topo II in this primitive bodonid is important for our understanding of evolution of catenation, replication, and other exciting features of the kinetoplast. Herein, we present characterization of the topo II gene of B. saltans and novel localization of the protein in its mitochondrion and nucleus. Surprisingly, topo II is dispersed throughout the kinetoplast bundle, despite the absence of a catenated kDNA network in this species. This suggests a significant functional difference between the B. saltans and trypanosomatid topoisomerases. Cultivation of B. saltans, strain K1 isolated from Lake Konstanz, Germany, was up-scaled to obtain sufficient amount of cells (108-109) and performed essentially as described (19Blom D. de Haan A. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1205-1213Google Scholar). Feeder bacteriaAlcaligenes xylosoxidans denitrificans were carefully removed by repeated overnight sedimentation in columns at 4 °C followed by multiple differential sedimentation of bacteria and flagellates during centrifugations. C. fasciculata,Leishmania tarentolae, and T. brucei were cultivated according to standard protocols. Total DNA of B. saltans was isolated as described elsewhere (14Blom D. de Haan A. van den Burg J. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1-15Google Scholar,19Blom D. de Haan A. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1205-1213Google Scholar). The 1.5-kb-long ATP-binding domain of the topo II gene of B. saltans (BstopoII) was PCR-amplified with degenerate oligonucleotides 12C6 (CATGT(A/C)CT(C/G)(A/C)T(A/G)(C/A)(G/A)CC(G/A)GAGA(T/C)GTAC) and 12C7 (CC(A/G)TC(T/G)GC(A/G)TCCTG(A/C)TC(T/G)GTCAT(G/A)A) using the following program: 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). The amplicon was cloned into the pBluescript SK− vector (Stratagene) and sequenced using the Prism DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A genomic library was constructed using partiallySau3AI-digested DNA that was, after phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, ligated into theBamHI-digested λ GEM11 vector arms and subsequently packaged using the Packagene extract (Promega) and amplified in the MB406 Escherichia coli cells. The resulting library contained ∼1.25 × 105 plaque-forming units, and half of it was screened with a fragment containing the ATP-binding domain of the BstopoII gene radioactively labeled by nick translation. Screening was performed in the hybridization solution (3× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficol, 0.1% BSA, 0.1% polyvinyl pyrrolidone), 0.1% SDS, 25 μg/ml sheared herring sperm DNA, and 10% dextran sulfate) at 65 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice in 3x SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice in 1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice in 0.3x SSC, 0.1% SDS, and twice in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, each wash at 65 °C for 20 min. Three positive plaques were purified by two rounds of plating and hybridization. The recombinant phage DNA from two different selected clones was analyzed by Southern hybridization after the digestions with EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII,SacI, and SalI, resolved on 0.75% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond N+membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with the same probe. Hybridizing fragments were cloned into appropriately predigested pGEM11f or pGEM7f vectors (Promega) and sequenced. Additional topo II gene sequences used in this work were retrieved from GenBankTM and include: Leishmania infantum (AY004225), Leishmania donovani (AF150876), Leishmania chagasi (O61078),Crithidia fasciculata (P27570), T. brucei (P12531), Trypanosoma cruzi (P30190),Dictyostelium discoideum (P90520), Plasmodium falciparum (P41001), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (P06786),Schizosaccharomyces pombe (AL031174), Encephalitozoon cuniculi (AL590444), Drosophila melanogaster (P15348),Caenorhabditis elegans (Z49069), Sus scrofa(O46374), and Homo sapiens α (P11388) and β (Q02880) subunits. Multiple alignment of the amino acid sequences was performed using the CLUSTAL W package (www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/searches/e.html) and is available upon request. Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony analyses were performed using PUZZLE-TREE (20Strimmer K. Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Google Scholar) and PAUP* (21Swofford D.L. PAUP*, Version 4. Sinauer Assoc., Sunderland, MA1998Google Scholar), respectively, with P. falciparum as an outgroup. The Dayhoff amino acid substitution model and the model of rate heterogeneity with γ−distribution in 10 rate categories, as implemented in PUZZLE-TREE, were applied. The corresponding Quartet-puzzling and bootstrap analyses included 1000 replicates. 10-μg aliquots of total genomic DNA of B. saltans were digested withBamHI, EcoRI, SalI, SmaI, and XhoI, separated on 0.75% ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel, and blotted. A C-terminal region of BstopoII used for expression (see below) was labeled with DIG/dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by PCR and used as a probe. Total cellular mRNA was extracted from 1 × 108 exponentially growing cells using the QuickPrep micro mRNA kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The first cDNA strand was synthesized from 300 ng of poly(A) using the SuperScript Preamplification system (Invitrogen). Control was performed without the addition of reverse transcriptase. Two primer pairs were used: IK2-GCAAGGAGCTCTGTGATCTC (positions 1481–1500 within the coding region) and IK6-CTTCTTGAGTTGCGTGTTCAG (positions 3091–3111), and IK20 and IK21 (positions 2896–2916 and 3572–3591; for sequences see below). The PCR program consisted of 94 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 90 s with a final extension 72 °C for 10 min. A 700-bp-long fragment covering most of the C-terminal variable region of BstopoII was PCR-amplified from the EcoRI genomic clone with oligonucleotide IK20-GCCATATGCATCATCATCATCATCATGCAGATTCCTCCGCAAGCCCC (containing the NdeI site that creates the initiation codon and six histidine codons (underlined)) and IK21-GCGGATCCTCAACGCACCACCATCTCCCCAG (containing the BamHI site and the stop codon (underlined)). The amplicon digested with NdeI and BamHI was gel-purified and cloned into the pRSET A expression vector (Invitrogen) digested with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting expression plasmid encoding the His6-3′-topo II end was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). 1 ml of overnight culture was added to 0.5 liter of medium and incubated at 25 °C until A 600 reached 1.0. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration 0.05 mm, and the culture was grown for another hour at 25 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in the 1× binding buffer (Novagen), and lysed by the addition of 100 μg/ml lysozyme and three cycles of freezing and thawing followed by sonication for 30 s. The suspension was centrifuged, and the His-tagged overexpressed protein was purified from the supernatant by the metal-chelate affinity chromatography on a Ni2+ chelate resin under native conditions as specified by the manufacturer (Novagen). Polyclonal antibody BstopoII-1 was prepared by immunizing rabbit at 2-week intervals with four subcutaneous injections of 0.5 mg of purified recombinant topo II protein emulsified with complete (first injection) and incomplete (following injections) Freund's adjuvant. Another rabbit antibody (BstopoII-2) was raised against a synthetic oligopeptide corresponding to the 1163–1177-amino acid region (QRSNEKWKFFRRKKC) from the unique C terminus of the B. saltans topo II gene. The last cysteine was added to enhance efficient conjugation of the synthetic peptide to ovalbumin. Conjugation was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). Each injection, containing 0.3 mg of a conjugate of the synthetic BstopoII peptide and ovalbumin, was injected into a rabbit following the protocol described above. Serum was collected 7–10 days after the third and fourth injections and was tested by Western blotting. Both the His-topo II fusion protein and the synthetic peptide were immobilized on the AminoLink Plus Coupling Gel (Pierce) and used for affinity purification of both polyclonal antisera. Columns were washed with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), equilibrated with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), and washed again with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.8). Following equilibration was made with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5) and washed with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) until pH 7.5 was reached. The antisera were diluted 10 times with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and passed through the columns, which were than washed with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5). The majority of bound antibodies was eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), and after a wash with 10 mm Tris (pH 8.8), the remaining antibodies were released with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5). The antibody-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS with 0.02% sodium azide. Cell lysates were prepared from the B. saltans, C. fasciculata, L. tarentolae, andT. brucei cells at 1 × 107cells/10 μl as described elsewhere (22Pasion S.G. Hines J.C. Aebersold R. Ray D.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 57-68Google Scholar), analyzed on a 8% SDS-PAGE gel, and blotted. The E. coli extracts containing recombinant His-tagged protein (30 kDa) were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Blots were probed with polyclonal antisera raised against either the fusion protein (BstopoII-1; 1:2000) or the synthetic peptide (BstopoII-2; 1:1000). The secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:4000) coupled to alkaline phosphatase was visualized according to manufacturer's protocols using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were partially purified from the feeder bacteria by differential centrifugation and overnight sedimentation and resuspended in PBS at a concentration 1 × 107 cells/100 μl. 20 μl of the cell suspension was spotted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and cells were allowed to adhere for 20 min in a humidity chamber. The slides were submerged into 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 3 min at room temperature, and fixation was stopped by washing the slides with 0.1m glycine, pH 8.6, in PBS for 5 min followed by two washes in PBS for 5 min. Cells were permeabilized in 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS, and the blocking solution (10% BSA and 10% goat serum) in a humid chamber for 30 min at room temperature. After washing once in PBST (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) for 5 min, slides were incubated with the affinity-purified primary antibody diluted in PBST (BstopoII-1; 1:100; BstopoII-2; 1:20), and incubation was performed under the same conditions for 2 h. Slides were washed four times in PBST 5 min each and then incubated with the Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:400; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature in a humidity chamber. The incubation was followed by three washes in PBST and one wash in PBS 5 min each at room temperature. Finally, the slides were incubated in PBS containing 0.1 μg/ml DAPI for 3 min at room temperature, rinsed with distilled water, and mounted into the antifade Dabco (Fluka). The slides were examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 100 microscope, and black and white images were recorded with a cooled charge-coupled device camera Mega F-View II (Soft Imaging Systems, Munster), pseudo-colored, and superimposed with the aid of an image-processing program Adobe PhotoShop version 5.0. The minicircle conserved region of B. saltans (BSM1) was amplified using the primers MB1 (GGGGTACCCCAGCGTTTTTGATGCTGTT) and MB2 (GGAATTCCCTCTTTCCCTGGTACT) derived from the available minicircle sequences (14Blom D. de Haan A. van den Burg J. van den Berg M. Sloof P. Jirků M. Lukeš J. Benne R. RNA. 2000; 6: 1-15Google Scholar). Biotin labeling of BMS1 (1 unit of Taqpolymerase, 5 μm each primer, 0.1 mm dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.065 mm dTTP, and 0.35 mmBiotin-N6-dTTP (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences)) was carried out under the following conditions: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles) with a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The amplicon was gel-purified before use. The cells were processed and fixed as described for immunocytochemistry, but the fixation was stopped by washing the slides in the TN buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). They were then placed in a humidity chamber for the following incubations: 30 min at 37 °C in 100 μg/ml RNase A; 5 min at room temperature in 2× SSC; 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde; dehydrated and finally air-dried. After denaturation in the PCR buffer with Mg2+ for 3 min at 94 °C and immediate dehydration in icy methanol and air drying, the slides were incubated in the hybridization mix (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 12.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA, 0.125% SDS, and 1 ng of probe per slide; the probe was denatured at 76 °C for 15 min, cooled on ice, and supplemented with 2× SSC before use) overnight at 37 °C in a humidity chamber. They were washed in 2× SSC for 5 min at 39 °C, 50% formamide in 2× SSC for 10 min at 39 °C, 2× SSC for 5 min at room temperature (twice), and the TN buffer for 1 min at room temperature. Detection was by the Renaissance Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as follows: incubation in the TNB buffer (TN buffer + blocking reagent) for 30 min at 37 °C; streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:100 in the TNB buffer) for 30 min at room temperature; wash in the TNT buffer (TN buffer + 0.05% Tween 20) trice for 5 min at room temperature; incubation with biotinyl tyramide (diluted 1:50 in the amplification diluent) for 10 min at room temperature; wash in the TNT buffer trice for 5 min at room temperature; incubation with streptavidin-Texas Red (diluted 1:500 in the TNB buffer) for 30 min at 37 °C, and final wash in the TNT buffer trice for 5 min at room temperature. DNA was visualized with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml) or YOYO1 (1 nm) staining, and the slides were examined with a Zeiss Axioplan 100 microscope or a Zeiss LSM410 confocal microscope, respectively. To isolate the protein-coding region of the kinetoplast-associated type II topoisomerase, we designed degenerate oligonucleotides based on the multiple alignment of available topo II sequences of the trypanosomatids T. brucei, C. fasciculata, andT. cruzi, and PCR-amplified a conserved 1.5-kb-long ATP-binding region located in the N-terminal part of the gene (Fig.1 A). The PCR product of expected size was cloned, sequenced, and found to have a high similarity to the topo II of trypanosomatids. Next, we prepared a genomic library from the total DNA of B. saltans and more than 50,000 plaque-forming units were screened with the amplicon as a probe. Recombinant phage DNA from two positive phages (6–1, and 7–2) was purified and shown by Southern hybridization to contain parts of the gene of interest. Fragments generated byEcoRI (3.3 kb long), SalI (1.2 kb long), andSacI (3.5 kb long) were subcloned into either pGEM7 or pGEM11 vectors and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed that the cloned fragments overlap and contain the entire Bstopo II gene.Figure 1A, schematic diagram of theB. saltans topo II protein. The PCR-amplified region used to screen the genomic library and the overexpressed region used to generate the BstopoII-1 polyclonal antibodies are shown with abar. The conserved catalytic Tyr-786 is highlighted. The position and sequence of the synthetic oligopeptide against which the BstopoII-2 polyclonal antibodies were made is indicated. Also, positions of the predicted bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS-BP1 and 2) are shown. B, multiple alignment of predicted protein sequences of topo II from T. cruzi(P30190), T. brucei (P12531), C. fasciculata(P27570), L. chagasi (O61078), L. donovani(AF150876), and B. saltans (AY083347). The amino acids are numbered to the left of the respective sequences. Conserved positions are in black, conservatively substituted in gray, and variable positions in white. Gaps were introduced to optimize the alignment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The BstopoII protein-coding region is 1247 amino acids long with the predicted molecular mass being 139 kDa. Protein data base search with the predicted polypeptide using BLAST revealed homology with several topo II genes. On the amino acid level significant similarity with the homologs was observed throughout most of the open reading frame, while the C-terminal domain of BstopoII is unique. The most closely related sequences (42–49% identity) were the topo II genes of the trypanosomatids T. brucei, T. cruzi,Leishmania spp., and C. fasciculata (Fig.1 B). Mutual identity among the trypanosomatid topo II is much higher, ranging between 61 and 76%. On the amino acid level BstopoII has an identity of about 30% with other eukaryotic type II topoisomerases, represented by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, human and D. melanogaster topo II genes. The identity with the subunit B of the prokaryotic DNA gyrase dropped to about 13% (data not shown). In a phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of selected eukaryotic topo II genes, including all homologs available from flagellates, B. saltans constituted the earliest lineage within the long branch leading to the kinetoplastids (Fig.2). Maximum parsimony and likelihood analyses produced trees with generally the same topology and high support for the branching order. The analyses differed only in respect to the mutual relationship among C. fasciculata andLeishmania spp. that cannot be unambiguously resolved with the available data (Fig. 2). The topology of an unrooted tree analyzed with the above methods confirmed the position of B. saltanson the basis of the Kinetoplastida clade (data not shown). The studied protein-coding region contains features characteristic for the eukaryotic topo II genes, like the ATP-binding domain, the conserved Tyr-786 in the catalytic site, and the typical motif TEGDSAKA. Topo II is relatively short in trypanosomatids, and the Bstopo II gene is no exception. We did not find a mitochondrial target signal, which is also absent from genes coding for mitochondrially located topo II of other flagellates. Interestingly, within regions of high conservation, the B. saltans sequence contains two unique insertions 17 and 10 amino acids long. Moreover, the Profile server of the Prosite data base search identified two putative bipartite nuclear localization signals that are composed of basic amino acid residues. The terminal 100 amino acids have no similarity with other topo II genes (Fig. 1 B). We have performed Southern hybridization to determine the copy number of the Bstopo II gene. The presence of a single hybridizing band in total DNA cut with the restriction enzymes BamHI, EcoRI,SmaI, and XhoI or two hybridizing bands after theSalI digestion (this enzyme cuts once in the region covered by the probe) probed with the unique C-terminal domain strongly suggests that it is a single-copy gene (Fig.3). This is in accordance with other eukaryotes where topo II is also present in a single copy. The cloned fragment contained also 1.9 kb of the region 5′ to the start codon of the topo II protein-coding sequence and 150-bp long region behind the stop codon. In the adjacent regions no element involved in cycling of topo II, known from the related C. fasciculata (23Mahmood R. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6174-6182Google Scholar), was identified. Several attempts to detect the topo II mRNA by Northern hybridization were not successful. Therefore, we have resorted to the RT-PCR approach to detect this apparently rare transcript. Two primer pairs were used that spanned most of the coding region. In both cases, a single amplicon of expected size was obtained, while the omission of reverse transcriptase rendered the reaction negative (Fig. 4). Thus, we have confirmed that the topo II gene is transcribed. We have first attempted to detect the topo II protein in B. saltans using the monoclonal antibodies against C. fasciculata topo II (anti-CftopoII) that was shown to be localized exclusively in the kinetoplast (8Melendy T. Sheline C. Ray D.S. Cell. 1988; 55: 1083-1088Google Scholar). While the antibody recognized a single specific protein of expected size (∼130 kDa) in the lysate of C. fasciculata andL. tarentolae, under stringency conditions it failed to detect the protein in B. saltans and T. brucei(Fig. 5 C). Therefore we prepared specific polyclonal antibodies raised against theB. saltans topo II protein. To avoid possible cross-reactivity with the ATP-binding domain-containing proteins or with a different topo II, we decided to prepare antibodies against the C-terminal domain of BstopoII, which is a least conserved region. Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies raised against the His-tagged 30-kDa recombinant protein purified from the bacterial lysate showed a peptide of ∼130 kDa (Fig. 5 A), compatible with the expected size based on the deduced amino acid sequence. Moreover, several significantly weaker bands in the lower size range were also visible, while there was no cross-reactivity with cell lysates of the other kinetoplastid flagellates. We assume that the weakly cross-reacting proteins are derived from feeder bacteria rather than results of partial proteolysis since they were not recognized by the second antibody (see below). To verify the specificity of the 130-kDa band, a second rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated against a synthetic 15-amino acid-long oligopeptide synthesized according to a region in the C terminus of BstopoII (Fig. 1 A). In Western analysis of theB. saltans lysate, this affinity-purified antiserum reacted with a protein of the same size as the first one and no cross-hybridization with other proteins was observed (Fig.5 B). From results obtained by Western analysis of the cell lysates we concluded that both antibodies are specific for the B. saltans topo II protein. The region against which these antibodies were prepared is unique for the target gene, and the homology search revealed no similarity with othe"

Comparative analysis of the results allowed us to determine the influence of each amino acid on the calcium binding properties of the N-terminal regulatory domain of the protein. Compared with TnC, the Ca2+ affinity of N-terminal sites was: 1) increased 6-fold in F29W, 2) increased 3-fold in F29ZW, and 3) decreased slightly in F29HW. The Ca2+titration of F29ZW monitored by fluorescence displayed a bimodal curve related to sequential Ca2+ binding to the two N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites. Single and double mutants of TnC, F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW were constructed by replacing aspartate by alanine at position 30 (site I) or 66 (site II) or both. Ca2+ binding data showed that the Asp → Ala mutation at position 30 impairs calcium binding to site I only, whereas the Asp → Ala mutation at position 66 impairs calcium binding to both sites I and II. Furthermore, the Asp → Ala mutation at position 30 eliminates the differences in Ca2+ affinity observed for replacement of Phe at position 29 by Trp, 5-hydroxytryptophan, or 7-azatryptophan. We conclude that position 29 influences the affinity of site I and that Ca2+ binding to site I is dependent on the previous binding of metal to site II.

TnC has a dumbbell-shaped structure with the globular N-terminal and C-terminal domains separated by a nine-turn α-helix (5Herzberg O. James M.N. Nature. 1985; 313: 653-659Google Scholar, 6Herzberg O. James M.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 761-779Google Scholar). Calcium binds with high affinity (Kd ≈ 10−7m) to the two EF-hand Ca2+/Mg2+ binding sites located at the TnC C-terminal domain (sites III and IV, the C-terminal sites) and with low affinity (Kd ≈10−5m) to the two EF-hand Ca2+-specific binding sites located in the TnC N-terminal domain (sites I and II, the N-terminal sites) (7Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Google Scholar). Because of the affinity and kinetic properties of the C-terminal sites they are believed to be always occupied by Ca2+ or Mg2+ in vivo and are involved in the stable TnC binding to TnI (8Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to the two TnC N-terminal sites results in a greatly increased affinity for the TnI C-terminal and inhibitory regions, resulting in their dissociation from actin and disinhibition of the actomyosin interaction. The affinity and cooperativity of calcium binding to TnC have been studied extensively. These parameters are determined through direct measurement of free calcium concentration in association systems (direct techniques) (7Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol.

These studies largely agree on the value of the binding constants but disagree with regard to the cooperativity parameter. Cooperativity between N-terminal sites has been detected only by indirect techniques, raising the possibility that potentially damaging conditions, the extensive time needed to prepare samples, or the intrinsically high errors involved in direct techniques disturb or conceal the N-terminal site cooperativity. In one of the studies using indirect techniques (25Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Google Scholar) we constructed a spectral probe mutant of recombinant skeletal chicken TnC, named TnCF29W (or simply F29W), in which Phe-29 was replaced by Trp. This position is immediately adjacent to Ca2+ binding site I (residues 30–41), and the substitution was expected to cause only minor alterations in both apo and Ca2+-saturated forms of the wild type N-terminal domain structure. Upon Ca2+ binding to F29W N-terminal sites there is a 3-fold increase in the intensity of fluorescence emission at 340 nm. This mutant binds Ca2+with a Hill coefficient of 1.96, reflecting a high degree of cooperativity between sites I and II. High values of cooperativity for N-terminal sites were also detected by far-UV CD measurements of wild type chicken recombinant TnC (23Golosinska K. Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Oikawa K. Kay C.M.

Later reports, however, indicated that the properties of the F29W N-terminal domain are different from those of TnC (29Chandra M. da Silva E.F. Sorenson M.M. Ferro J.A. Pearlstone J.R. Nash B.E.

Acta. 1999; 1431: 53-63Google Scholar), and NMR studies using the isolated N-terminal domain of TnC indicated that sites I and II are sequentially occupied (with a nearly 10-fold affinity difference) with no cooperativity between them (32Li M.X. Gagné S.M. Tsuda S. Kay C.M. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8330-8340Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy and to understand the influence of position 29 of chicken TnC on the properties of N-terminal sites, we introduced the amino acid analogs 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HW) and 7-azatryptophan (7-ZW) into position 29 of TnC (35Barlati S. Ciferri O. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 166-172Google Scholar, 36Ross J.B. Senear D.F. Waxman E. Kombo B.B. Rusinova E. Huang Y.T. Laws W.R. Hasselbacher C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ca2+ binding by these new mutants (F29HW and F29ZW, respectively), as well as F29W and TnC was analyzed using a direct flow dialysis calcium binding assay and indirectly by fluorescence. We have also constructed fluorescent and nonfluorescent mutants with Asp → Ala replacements at position X of sites I or II or both sites to assert the dependence of N-domain calcium binding properties on each site. These mutants were submitted to flow dialysis and/or fluorescence assays. Our data indicate that: 1) tryptophan at position 29 increases the N-terminal site calcium affinity nearly 6-fold compared with TnC; 2) 5-HW at position 29 lowers the N-terminal site calcium affinity to levels slightly below those of TnC; 3) 7-ZW at position 29 increases the N-terminal site affinities to an intermediate level, between the F29W and TnC N-terminal site affinities; 4) the flow dialysis data obtained with Asp → Ala mutants indicate that when Asp at the first position (X) of site II is replaced by Ala, site I does not bind Ca2+. Conversely, calcium binding to site II is maintained by Asp → Ala mutation at position X of site I. 5) The fluorescence data indicate lower values of cooperativity between F29W N-terminal sites than reported previously and a still lower N-terminal site cooperativity value for F29HW. 6) 7-ZW probe at position 29 senses the binding of calcium to the higher affinity N-terminal site (site II) by increasing fluorescence and to the lower (in the case of F29ZW) affinity N-terminal site (site I) by decreasing the fluorescence in a bimodal fluorescence change. This observation indicates stepwise calcium binding to the regulatory N-terminal sites. In conclusion, the data obtained with isolated TnC and its mutants support a model for stepwise Ca2+ binding to N-terminal sites, suggesting that site I does not bind Ca2+ when site II is unoccupied. Our results also indicate that mutations in position 29 alter the properties of the regulatory sites. The D30A and D66A (8Farah C.S. Miyamoto C.A. Ramos C.H. da Silva A.C. Quaggio R.B. Fujimori K. Smillie L.B. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5230-5240Google Scholar) and F29W mutants (25Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Google Scholar) were used to obtain the mutants D30A/D66A, F29W/D30A, F29W/D66A, and F29W/D30A/D66A using the overlap extension PCR method (41Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar). The primers to generate the Asp → Ala mutation at position 30 on the F29W gene were 5′-C ACC ACC GTC CGC AGC CCA CAT GTC AAA-3′ and 5′-TTT GAC ATG TGG GCT GCG GAC GGT GGT G-3′. The Asp → Ala mutation at position 66 was generated with the primers 5′-C GCT GCC ATC CTC GGC CAC CTC CTC GAT GA-3′ and 5′-TC ATC GAG GAG GTG GCC GAG GAT GGC AGC G-3′. The PCR products were purified from low melting agarose gels and used in the overlap extension reactions. These final products were digested withBamHI and NdeI and inserted to pET3a (42Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The expression and purification of TnC and the mutant F29W have been described (10Fujimori K. Sorenson M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Reinach F.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 182-184Google Scholar, 25Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C.

The same procedure was used to express and purify D/A and F29 D/A mutants. To incorporate 5-HW or 7-ZW into TnC mutants a derivative of W3110TrpA33 (44Drapeau G.R. Brammar W.J. Yanofsky C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 357-367Google Scholar) was constructed by infecting this strain with phage λDE3 (42Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Google Scholar) and transforming with plasmid pLysS (45Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Google Scholar). The new strain, named W3110TrpA33(DE3)pLysS, carries the auxotrophic marker for tryptophan from the mother strain, the T7 RNA polymerase gene from phage λDE3 under control of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible promoterlacUV5, and the lysozyme gene from plasmid pLysS. By transforming this strain with plasmid pET-F29W or pET-F29W D/A we could strictly regulate the production of large amounts of the desired mRNA. To incorporate the Trp analogs we grew transformed W3110TrpA33(DE3)pLysS cells in M9 minimal medium containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 5 mg/liter thiamin, and 20 μg/ml l-tryptophan. When the culture reached anA 600nm ≈1.0, cells were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in M9 minimal medium plus 200 μg/ml ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and 100 μg/ml 5-HW or 7-ZW instead ofl-tryptophan, followed by 3 h of additional incubation at 37 °C with vigorous shaking (37Hogue C.W. Rasquinha I. Szabo A.G. MacManus J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 269-272Google Scholar). The protein purification process was the same of that of TnC (10Fujimori K. Sorenson M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Reinach F.C. Nature. 1990; 345: 182-184Google Scholar), yielding 10–20 mg of protein/liter of culture. Trp analog incorporation was estimated based on a comparative analysis of the absorbance and emission spectra of the proteins. The absorbance spectra of proteins (18–24 μm) and free amino acids (100 μm) were obtained in 5 m guanidine HCl. The F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW absorbance spectra were normalized by subtracting the TnC absorbance spectrum to discount the contribution of the phenylalanines. The percentage of 5-HW incorporation into mutant F29HW (H%) was estimated using the equation H%=1001−SAN5H¯W−SANF29H¯WSAN5H¯W−SANF29WEquation 1 where SAN5HW, SANSF29W, and SANF29HW are the areas between 269 and 324 nm of the normalized absorbance spectra of 5-HW, F29W, and F29HW, respectively. The 7-ZW incorporation into F29ZW is more straightforward because the emission spectra is red shifted with a maximum near 380 nm. We subtracted the two normalized F29ZW emission spectra obtained by excitation at 287 or 315 nm, and the difference (seen as a small peak near 340 nm) was transformed back to absolute values. This area was compared with that of a sample with a known F29W concentration and assumed to represent the amount of F29W contaminating the F29ZW sample. Flow dialysis experiments were performed as described previously (11da Silva A.C. de Araujo A.H. Herzberg O. Moult J. Sorenson M. Reinach F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 599-604Google Scholar) with some modifications. The buffers used in dialysis to remove bound Ca2+ from proteins were: buffer A, which contained 20 mm MOPS, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.0; 2) buffer A with 2 mm EDTA; 3) buffer A but with no EDTA. The proteins were dialyzed with each buffer for 12 h with two changes. We have found that using Spectra/Por dialysis tubing in all steps gives the most reproducible results. Protein concentration was determined as described previously (46Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Google Scholar) using as standard a TnC sample whose concentration was determined through amino acid analysis (Met and Val content). Protein concentration in the dialysis chamber was 13 μm and was adjusted with the same buffer used for the flow dialysis experiment. The Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear regression algorithm of Jandel Scientific SigmaPlot 2.0 package was used for curve fitting. The number of calcium sites of each protein was inferred from the saturation plateau obtained with pCa values between 4.5 and 4.0. This avoided the introduction of another parameter in the curve fitting associated with nonspecific calcium binding at lower pCa values. The data from TnC or F29X (where X = W,HW, or ZW) were fitted using Equation 2. [Cabound2+][TnC]=2[Cafree2+]n1(Kd1)n1+[Cafree2+]n1+2[Cafree2+]n2(Kd2)n2+[Cafree2+]n2Equation 2 The data from D30A and F29X/D30A were fitted using Equation 3.[Cabound2+][TnC]=2[Cafree2+]n1(Kd1)n1+[Cafree2+]n1+[Cafree2+]Kd2+[Cafree2+]Equation 3 The data from D66A, D30A/D66A, F29X/D66A, and F29X/D30A/D66A were fitted using Equation 4,[Cabound2+][TnC]=2[Cafree2+]n1(Kd1)n1+[Cafree2+]n1Equation 4 where K d1, n 1,K d2, and n 2 are the apparent dissociation constant and Hill coefficients, respectively, for the C-terminal sites and the N-terminal sites. The fluorescence experiments were performed in a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorometer with 2.5 nm excitation slit and 5 nm emission slit for F29W and 5 nm for excitation and emission slits for all other mutants. The excitation wavelength used was 287 nm for F29W and F29W/D30A and 315 nm for F29X and F29X/D30A. The temperature of the cell was kept at 25 °C. We used the calcium-free protein batch used in the flow dialysis experiments. The volume of the protein solution in the fluorescence assays was 2.5 ml, and calcium was added to maintain its concentration the same as in the flow dialysis experiments. In this way, we could use the mean pCa values obtained in the flow dialysis experiments to correlate to the data obtained in the fluorescence experiments. Curve fitting for F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW/D30A (negative variation for F29ZW/D30A) was performed adjusting the experimental data to Equation 5. F=100[Cafree2+]n2(Kd2)n2+[Cafree2+]n2Equation 5 Curve fitting for F29W/D30A and F29HW/D30A was performed adjusting the experimental data to Equation 6,F=100[Cafree2+]Kd2+[Cafree2+]Equation 6 where F is the relative fluorescence change,K d2 the apparent dissociation constant for calcium binding to the N-terminal sites (or the microscopic dissociation constant to the remaining N site for the F29/D30A mutants) and n 2 the Hill coefficient reflecting the cooperativity between the two N sites. Curve fitting for F29ZW was performed adjusting the experimental data to Equation 7F=f21Kd12[Cafree2+]Kd12Kd21+Kd12[Cafree2+]+[Cafree2+]2Equation 7 +f12[Cafree2+]2Kd12Kd21+Kd12[Cafree2+]+[Cafree2+]2where F is the relative fluorescence change,f 21 is the relative fluorescence change associated with the filling of the site II, K d21is the microscopic dissociation constant for site II,f 12 is the relative fluorescence change associated with the filling of the site I, andK d12 is the microscopic dissociation constant for site I. Fig.1 A shows the normalized absorbance spectra of the three isolated amino acids, Trp, 5-HW, and 7-ZW. Both 5-HW and 7-ZW have red shifted absorbance compared with tryptophan. This characteristic is maintained in the absorbance spectra of the corresponding recombinant TnC mutants, F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1, C–E, demonstrates the similarity between the free amino acid and the corresponding protein absorbance spectra. The normalized excitation and emission spectra of the three amino acids and the three mutants are shown in Fig.2. The fluorescence of F29W increases nearly three times upon addition of Ca2+ (pCa 2.0), as reported previously (25Pearlstone J.R. Borgford T. Chandra M. Oikawa K. Kay C.M. Herzberg O. Moult J. Herklotz A. Reinach F.C. Smillie L.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6545-6553Google Scholar). When excited at 315 nm, the fluorescence of F29HW increases nearly seven times upon addition of Ca2+ (pCa 2.0) (this increase drops to nearly three times when the excitation wavelength is 287 nm). The fluorescence of F29ZW displays a bimodal response to Ca2+, increasing nearly 40% from pCa 9.0 topCa 5.0 and decreasing nearly 20% from pCa 5.0 to pCa 3.0. Quantitative analysis of the absorbance and emission spectra of the recombinant TnC indicates 87–96% analog incorporation efficiency for F29HW and nearly 96% for F29ZW (see “Materials and Methods”). Because of this incorporation ratio the results obtained with both analog mutants are not significantly distorted by contamination with F29W. We used the same procedure in producing all of the other F29HW D/A and F29ZW D/A mutants. Fig.3 A shows the calcium binding curves to TnC and to the three fluorescent mutants, F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW as determined by flow dialysis. Calcium binding curves indicate that all four proteins bind four Ca2+/molecule and that near saturation is achieved between pCa 4.5 and 4.0. At pCa values less than 4, there is an increase in the calcium binding ratio which is most possibly related to nonspecific calcium binding to TnC. Thus, pCa 4 was assumed to be the maximum Ca2+ concentration to which we could relate any dependent parameter. The TnC and F29HW Ca2+binding curves are similar regarding the overall transition. BetweenpCa 5.5 and pCa 4.0, the most evident difference among the binding curves is the displacement of the F29W and F29ZW curves toward higher pCa values compared with TnC and F29HW. This reflects an increase in the affinity of the low affinity N-terminal sites. The C-terminal sites have affinities nearly 100 times higher than the N-terminal sites and are represented by the lower part of curves (between pCa 7 and 5.5). Fig. 3 B compares the relative fluorescence changes of F29W, F29HW, and F29ZW. The data were obtained under the same conditions as the flow dialysis experiments, that is, in absence of EGTA. The fluorescence experiments showed that the half-transition point of F29HW occurs 0.7 pCa unit after the F29W transition. This confirms the lower calcium affinity of F29HW N-terminal sites with respect to the F29W N-terminal sites. The F29ZW fluorescence change is bimodal, with the maximum value at ≈pCa 5 and a final decrease of nearly 20%, which plateaus at pCa 3.5. In Fig. 3, C–E, we compare flow dialysis and fluorescence data for each mutant to correlate the fluorescence changes with calcium saturation level and to determine the point in the free calcium titration which corresponds to the fluorescence change. In the case of F29W and F29HW (Fig. 3, C and D), the greater part of the fluorescence change occurs above the pCa where there are two bound calcium ions/molecule. This limit is better defined for F29HW than for F29W. The difference in affinity between F29HW C-terminal and N-terminal sites is nearly 0.7pCa unit higher than between C-terminal and N-terminal sites of F29W. These Ca2+-dependent fluorescence changes provide direct evidence that calcium binding to the C-terminal sites does not alter the fluorescence of the tryptophan or 5-HW incorporated at position 29 of TnC and that these probes selectively report calcium binding to the regulatory N-terminal sites of TnC. Fig. 3 E shows fluorescence of F29ZW during titration with Ca2+. The maximal fluorescence value occurs at pCa 5.0 and is associated in the calcium binding curve with three bound Ca2+/molecule. Therefore, in the case of this mutant, the probe can be used to distinguish between the binding of the third and the fourth Ca2+ ions. Fig. 4 shows calcium binding measured by flow dialysis to TnC and its D/A mutants (A), F29W and F29W D/A mutants (B), F29HW and F29HW D/A mutants (C), and F29ZW and F29ZW D/A mutants (D). The data for TnC and its D/A mutants show that the Asp → Ala mutations at position 30 or 66 or the combined mutations affect predominantly the calcium binding at pCa lower than 6, i.e. in a range associated with binding to N-terminal sites. This is in agreement with the structural independence of the C- and N-domains of TnC. Near pCa 6, the TnC and D30A binding curves diverge from the D66A and D30A/D66A binding curves. The D66A and D30A/D66A binding curves are similar and indicate that these mutants bind only two Ca2+ ions. The TnC and D30A binding curves diverge only at pCa lower than 5, where the D30A binding curve reaches a plateau (indicating a maximum of three Ca2+ bound/protein). The TnC binding curve continues to four bound Ca2+/molecule at pCa 4. This pattern is also found in the calcium binding curves of the fluorescent D/A mutants (Fig. 4, B–D). The difference is that the presence of the fluorescent probes affects the pCa at which the curves for the non-D/A and the corresponding D30A mutant diverge (pCa ≈ 6 for F29W and F29W/D30A,pCa ≈ 4.6 for F29HW and F29HW/D30A, and pCa ≈ 5.4 for F29ZW and F29ZW/D30A). The corresponding fluorescent and nonfluorescent D66A and D30A/D66A calcium binding curves largely superimpose over the entire pCa scale (Fig.4). Fig. 5 shows the fluorescence change upon calcium binding to the fluorescent D/A mutants, which bind only one or zero Ca2+ ions in their N-terminal domains. Fig.5 A compares the fluorescence change of each mutant upon calcium binding (relative to the apo form = 100%). For all D30A mutants, the Ca2+-induced fluorescence increase is much less than that observed in the original fluorescent mutants that possess two functional N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites. In the case of F29ZW/D30A the fluorescence intensity decreases slightly upon Ca2+ binding. For all D66A and D30A/D66A mutants, the fluorescence change was very small or nonexistent. Therefore, these latter mutants were not used in the subsequent fluorescence following calcium titrations. Fig. 5, B–D, displays the fluorescence and flow dialysis Ca2+ binding curves for the fluorescent D30A mutants: F29W/D30A, F29HW/D30A, and F29ZW/D30A, respectively. Approximately 60% of the total fluorescence change of F29W/D30A, F29HW/D30A, and F29ZW/D30A occurs after the calcium saturation level reaches two Ca2+ions/molecule and is complete when the calcium saturation level reaches three Ca2+/molecule. This indicates that Ca2+binding to the single functioning N-terminal site in these proteins (site II) is the event associated with the fluorescence change. Fig. 6 further highlights the similarity between fluorescent and nonfluorescent forms of D30A and compares the fluorescence changes during calcium titration of the fluorescent mutants with and without the D30A substitution. These results are summarized in Table II. Fig. 6 A compares the calcium binding curves obtained by flow dialysis for fluorescent and nonfluorescent D30A mutants. The four binding curves are similar, indicating that the effect of the three different probes at position 29 on Ca2+binding to site II is very small in the D30A mutants. Fig.6 B compares the fluorescence changes during calcium titration of the fluorescent D30A mutants. The threepCa1/2 values are very similar: ∼5.5 for F29W/D30A and F29HW/D30A and ∼5.3 for F29ZW/D30A. Fig. 6, C–E, compares the calcium titrations followed by fluorescence of the fluorescent mutants with and without the D30A mutation. Both F29W and F29W/D30A have apCa1/2 close to 5.5, and the curves differ only slightly at low free calcium concentrations (Fig. 6 C). Interestingly, when 5-HW instead of tryptophan is present at position 29, the D30A mutation has a much greater effect: thepCa1/2 of F29HW is ∼4.8 whereas the pCa1/2 of F29HW/D30A is ∼5.5. The slopes of both curves are similar (predicted Hill coefficient of 1.11 for F29HW and fixed to 1 for F29HW/D30A). Fig. 6 E compares the F29ZW and F29ZW/D30A curves. The bimodal shape of the F29ZW curve is replaced by a monotonic decrease in F29ZW/D30A, with pCa1/2 ≈ 5.3 (see Table II).Table IIDissociation constants and Hill coefficients for F29W, F29HW, F29ZW, and its D30A mutants measured by fluorescenceK d2K d2n 2K d21Kd12× 107 ×m−1× 107 ×m−1× 107 ×m−1× 107 × m−1F29W39.20 ± 1.201.29 ± 0.02F29W/D30A32.70 ± 0.94F29HW184.60 ± 54.451.11 ± 0.09F29HW/D30A31.22 ± 3.48F29ZW59.2 ± 3.281.4 ± 8.1F29ZW/D30AaAlthough F29ZW/D30A has an unique functional N-site, the fluorescence curve showed an abnormal slope.

https://openalex.org/W2131051835,"Interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptase (RT) and structures mimicking intermediates proposed to occur during recombination (strand transfer) were investigated. One mechanism proposed for strand transfer is strand exchange in which a homologous RNA (acceptor) “invades” a donor RNA·DNA duplex (replication intermediate) on which DNA synthesis is occurring. The acceptor displaces the donor of the duplex and binds to the DNA. During exchange a transient trimeric structure forms. A model structure was designed with a replication intermediate to which an acceptor RNA was bound. The acceptor was bound to the 5′-end of the DNA over a 54-base region, whereas the donor associated with the DNA 3′-end over a 28-base region. The dimeric constituents of the trimer (acceptor RNA·DNA and donor RNA·DNA) were also constructed. The acceptor RNA·DNA formed a branched structure in this case. Results showed that RT could cleave the RNA portion of all the structures examined. Association with junction substrates was less stable as determined by off-rates. On the trimer, RT cleaved both RNAs but showed a clear preference for cleaving the donor RNA region. This preference was accentuated by HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC). Results suggest that during recombination RT generally associates with the donor-RNA portion of the trimer and the acceptor RNA is protected but not immune from cleavage. The partial protection likely allows the acceptor RNA to more easily complete strand exchange and shield this RNA to provide a means to salvage replication if the DNA were to dissociate from the cleaved donor RNA.

Results showed that RT could cleave the RNA portion of all the structures examined. Association with junction substrates was less stable as determined by off-rates. On the trimer, RT cleaved both RNAs but showed a clear preference for cleaving the donor RNA region. This preference was accentuated by HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC). Results suggest that during recombination RT generally associates with the donor-RNA portion of the trimer and the acceptor RNA is protected but not immune from cleavage. The partial protection likely allows the acceptor RNA to more easily complete strand exchange and shield this RNA to provide a means to salvage replication if the DNA were to dissociate from the cleaved donor RNA. nucleocapsid protein reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus ribonuclease H, DTT, dithiothreitol Strand transfer is an essential step in retroviral replication and has been shown to occur from terminal regions and internal regions of RNA templates. Minus strand DNA strand transfer is proposed to potentially occur by two different mechanisms (1DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In one, DNA being synthesized on an RNA template (referred to as the donor in this case) dissociates from the RNA and binds to a homologous region on a second RNA (referred to as the acceptor) where synthesis continues. A second mechanism proposes that the acceptor RNA actively participates in the displacement of the DNA strand by associating with the DNA and dislodging the donor. Because retroviruses are diploid, the donor and acceptor RNAs would represent the two genome copies in the capsid. Results from previous experiments suggest that viral nucleocapsid protein (NC)1 stimulates the binding of a complementary RNA acceptor template to the DNA displacing the donor RNA in the process (2DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16350-16356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the second mechanism above, this implies that strand transfer could proceed through a trimeric complex consisting of the nascent DNA bound to both the RNA template it was being made on (donor) and a second homologous RNA (acceptor). Such a structure has been shown to occur during DNA transfer in vitro (2DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16350-16356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Models developed in vivo (4Delviks K.A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vitro (5Negroni M. Buc H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 275-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Kim J.K. Palaniappan C.

Little is known about what activities RT manifests on such a structure. The binding and orientation of RT to such a structure would become important, because both the RNA templates are accessible to the enzyme. The fate of the acceptor template is important, because degradation of the acceptor prior to transfer would eliminate a potential pathway to continue DNA synthesis if the nascent DNA were to dissociate from the donor template. In this report, experiments were designed to characterize the activity of RT on strand transfer intermediates with the goal of determining if RT has a preference for associating with the donor or acceptor RNA on a trimeric strand transfer intermediate and if the RNase H activity of RT cleaves these RNAs. Three separate templates were designed to mimic the entire strand transfer intermediate (trimeric structure) or various parts of this structure. One template consisted of the donor RNA bound to the DNA (donor RNA·DNA), which mimics the “replication intermediate.” The second template consisted of the acceptor RNA bound to the DNA such that the bases at the 3′-end of the DNA are not hybridized to the acceptor (acceptor RNA·DNA). This mimics the binding of the acceptor RNA to the DNA of the replication intermediate. The third structure, the strand transfer intermediate, contains both the donor and acceptor RNAs bound to DNA. Previous results have indicated that RT is anchored to nucleic acid substrates by a 3′ recessed DNA terminus or a 5′ recessed RNA terminus (7Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

With this in mind, RT would be expected to bind preferentially to the donor RNA of the trimer, because the 3′-end of the DNA strand is recessed on the donor RNA. In contrast, there is no 3′ recessed DNA end on the acceptor RNA and the 5′-end of the acceptor is not associated with the DNA suggesting that RT would not efficiently cleave the acceptor RNA. Results showed that RT cleaved both RNAs of the trimer but with a clear preference for cleaving the donor RNA region. In the presence of HIV nucleocapsid protein (NC), this preference was even stronger. The findings imply that during recombination RT generally associates with the donor-RNA portion of the trimeric recombination intermediate and the acceptor RNA is protected but not immune from cleavage. The partial protection likely allows the acceptor RNA to more easily complete strand exchange and shield this RNA to provide a means to salvage replication if the DNA were to dissociate from the cleaved donor RNA. Wild-type recombinant HIV-RT was graciously provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). Aliquots of the enzyme were stored at −70 °C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from United States Biochemical. HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC) was obtained from Enzyco (Denver, CO). SP6, T3 RNA polymerases, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, and rNTPs were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.PvuII was obtained from American Allied Biochemical.HaeIII, placental RNase inhibitor, and Escherichia coli RNase H were obtained from Promega. Deoxyoligonucleotides were synthesized by Genosys Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). Proteinase K was obtained from Sigma. All other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific or Sigma. Radiolabeled compounds were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Run-off transcription was performed according to the instructions of the enzyme manufacturer. The donor RNA (5′-GGGAACAAAAGCUAAUUCGCCCUAUAGUGAGUCGUAUUACAAUCACUGG) was made from HaeIII cleavage of pBSM13(Δ) (14DeStefano J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and T3 RNA polymerase was used to prepare run-off transcripts 50 nucleotides in length. For the acceptor RNA (5′-GAAUACUCAAGCUUAUGCAUGCGGCCGCAUCUAGAGGGCCCGGAUCAAUUCGAGCUCGGUACCCGGGGAUCCUCUAGAGUCGACCUGCAGGCAUGCAAG), the vector plasmid pGEM-11ZF+ (Promega) was cleaved withBamHI, and plasmid pBSM13+ was cleaved with EcoRI and HindIII. All termini were filled in with Klenow polymerase. The EcoRI/HindIII insert from pBSM13+ was isolated and ligated into the plasmid vector pGEM-11ZF+ and transformed into E. coli XL1 blue cells. Blue white screening was used to isolate white colonies that contained the pGEM-11ZF+ plasmid with the insert. The plasmid with the insert was isolated and used to obtain the acceptor RNA. The plasmid was cleaved with PvuII, and SP6 RNA polymerase was used to prepare run-off transcripts 262 nucleotides in length. Reactions for both the donor and acceptor RNA were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and precipitated with ethanol. The acceptor RNA was further cleaved to obtain an ∼99-base pair template as follows: To the acceptor RNA, a DNA oligonucleotide 20 bases long was hybridized by mixing the RNA and the specific primer deoxyoligonucleotide (5′-acctcgagggatcagcttgc) at a 1:5 (RNA:DNA) ratio in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 80 mm KCl. The DNA bound to bases 94–114 from the 5′-end of the RNA. The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The RNA was then treated with E. coli RNase H (4 units) at 37 °C for 30 min in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2, and 80 mm KCl. The final length of the RNA is approximate, because cleavage can theoretically occur anywhere within the 20-base hybrid region. In practice most RNAs differed by only a few bases in length. The precipitates from the donor RNA and the acceptor RNA after its treatment with E. coli RNase H were resuspended in 1× formamide dye (45% formamide, 5 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The two RNA were gel-purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The electrophoresed RNA was located by ultraviolet shadowing, excised, and eluted overnight by the crush and soak method (15Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 80 mm KCl, and 1 mm DTT. The eluate was separated from the polyacrylamide by centrifugation and subsequent filtration through a 0.45-μm disposable syringe filter. The RNA was recovered by precipitation in ethanol with 300 mm sodium acetate. The donor and acceptor RNAs were then dephosphorylated using calf-intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The alkaline phosphatase was heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 10 min. Reactions were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA precipitates were labeled at the 5′-end with32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions. A DNA oligonucleotide 93 bases in length (5′-GAGGGATCAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTGGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATA) was also radiolabeled at the 5′-end. Two other DNAs were also used in the construction of dimeric substrates, a second 93-base DNA (5′-GAGGGATCAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTGATCCGGGCCCTGTAATACGACTCACTATA) was used to construct the acceptor RNA·DNA (+10 hybrid) substrate (see “Results”), and a 64-nucleotide DNA (5′-GAGGGATCAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTG) was used to construct the acceptor RNA·DNA (recessed 3′-DNA) substrate. The RNA·DNA hybrid structures were made by mixing together the radiolabeled RNAs and the radiolabeled 93-mer DNA at a ratio of 1:2. The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 5 min and slowly cooled down to room temperature. After hybridization, 6× native gel loading buffer (40% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue) was added, and the mixture was electrophoresed on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) as described previously (15Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The hybrid complex was located by autoradiography, excised, and eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm DTT. The eluate was centrifuged and filtered as described above and used directly for experiments. The trimeric complex consisted of the donor and acceptor RNA bound to the 93-nucleotide DNA. The three radiolabeled components in the trimer had equal specific activities. The trimer was constructed by first making a hybrid of the donor RNA and the DNA at a ratio of 1:0.5. The hybrid was made as described above. To this hybrid, acceptor RNA was added in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 100 μmZnCl2, and 6 mm MgCl2. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in the presence of 5 μm NC. Proteinase K was then added to the mixture and placed at room temperature for an additional 20 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 6× native dye, and the sample was then run on a 6% native non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Other methods, including mixing all three components together at once or making the acceptor RNA·DNA first, were also tried in both the presence and absence of NC, but the above method gave the highest yields and most reproducible results. The trimeric complex was located by autoradiography, excised, and eluted at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm DTT. The eluate was centrifuged and filtered as described above and used directly for experiments. Donor and acceptor RNA templates were quantified spectrophotometrically by measuring the absorbance. The molecular weight of the RNA was used to determine the molar concentrations of the RNA templates. The amount of radiolabeled heteroduplex and trimeric substrates recovered from native gels was determined by specific activity. Quantification of RNase H cleavage products was accomplished by scanning the dried polyacrylamide gels with a phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad, GS 525). In the standard RNase H cleavage assay, 5 nm of either the heteroduplex or the trimeric substrate was incubated in a volume of 10.5 μl containing the following components at their final concentrations: 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 80 mm KCl, 7.1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 unit/μl RNasin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8), and 6 mm AMP at 37 °C. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 2 units (0.4 pmol) or in some 0.2 unit (0.04 pmol) of HIV-RT in a 2-μl solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, and 80 mm KCl. In RNase H assays performed in the presence of NC, the NC was allowed to preincubate with the substrate for 2 min before the initiation of the reaction. In these reactions, the amount of NC used is indicated in the figures. All reactions were terminated at the indicated times with 12.5 μl of 2× gel loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA (pH 8), 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). Samples were electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide (19:1 (w/w) acrylamide:bisacrylamide)-7 murea gels as described below. The gels were dried and used for cleavage product quantification by phosphorimaging using a Bio-Rad GS-525 phosphorimaging device. In assays designed to allow only a single binding event between the enzyme and template (“trap assay”), 2 units (or as indicated) of enzyme was allowed to preincubate with 5 nm template for 3 min in 10.5 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 80 mmKCl, 0.2 unit/μl RNasin, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mmEDTA (pH 8), and 5 mm AMP at 37 °C. The reactions were initiated with 2 μl of a supplement in the above buffer containing 37.5 mm MgCl2, and 2.5 μg of poly(rA)-oligo(dT20) primer-template was used as the trap. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times and were terminated by the addition of 12.5 μl of 2× gel loading buffer and electrophoresed as described above. Experiments designed to determine the dissociation rate constant were performed by pre-binding the enzyme (2 units) with the substrate (5 nm) in a volume of 8.5 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm DTT, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 unit/μl RNasin, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8), and 5 mm AMP at 37 °C. Two microliters of a solution containing 2.5 μg of poly(rA)-oligo(dT20) trap in the above buffer was added to the reaction and allowed to incubate further. At various times after trap addition, 2 μl of a solution containing 37.5 mm MgCl2 in the above buffer was added to initiate the cleavage reaction, and samples were incubated for 5 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 12.5 μl of 2× gel loading buffer, and electrophoresis was performed as described above. For the time zero point, trap and MgCl2 were added at the same time. Determinations ofk off values were performed by fitting the data for the relative amount of cleaved RNA versus time to an equation for exponential decay (f(x) = ae −bx, where a = 1,f(x) = y (relative cleavage), x = time, and b =k off value). In these experiments a slight modification was made. The value at 10 s was set equal to the starting relative value of 1 rather than the time 0 value. This allowed a significantly better fit of the data to the equation. This is probably due to the addition of MgCl2 along with the trap for time 0. Divalent cation greatly stabilizes binding of RT to the substrate (16Cristofaro J.V. Rausch J.W. Le Grice S.F. DeStefano J.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10968-10975Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because HIV-RT likely exists in a closed (tight binding) and open (weak binding) conformation (17Kensch O. Restle T. Wohrl B.M. Goody R.S. Steinhoff H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Wohrl B.M. Krebs R. Goody R.S. Restle T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Wöhrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), those bound in open conformation may rapidly switch to closed conformation upon Mg2+ binding while they would dissociate in the presence of trap and absence of Mg2+. This would result in a disproportionately high cleavage amount at the time 0 point as was observed. Denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide), containing 7 m urea, and native 6% polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) were prepared and subjected to electrophoresis as described (15Sambrook J. W. R.D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The substrates used for RNase H cleavage assays were described under “Experimental Procedures” and are depicted schematically in each autoradiogram. Five different structures were used. The main structure from which the others were derived is referred to as the “trimer” (Fig.1). It consisted of three nucleic acid strands, the donor and acceptor RNAs, and a DNA strand. The donor RNA and acceptor RNA were transcribed in vitro and radiolabeled at the 5′-end with 32P. The DNA oligonucleotide was also 5′-end-labeled. The donor RNA was 50 nucleotides in length, acceptor RNA approximately (see “Experimental Procedures”) 99 nucleotides in length, and the DNA 93 nucleotides in length. The acceptor RNA·DNA structure was designed such that a hybrid region of 54 bases formed between the 3′-end of the RNA and an internal portion of the DNA that started 30 bases from the 3′-end of the DNA. The donor RNA was designed such that a hybrid region of 28 bases formed between the 3′-ends of the DNA and donor. This design essentially left one unhybridized base (29th base from the 3′-DNA-end) between the donor and acceptor RNAs. There were also 10 bases at the 5′-end of the DNA that were not hybridized to RNA. Note that the 28-base hybrid formed between the donor RNA and the DNA is longer than the presumed 18 bases between the polymerase and RNase H active sites of HIV-RT. However, it is still within the realm of what is likely to exist in vivo. Because RNase H activity is generally only about one-tenth the polymerase activity (20Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hybrid regions between the nascent DNA and genomic RNA are likely to range from as long as about 30 bases down to sizes too small to remain stably associated (21DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24295-24301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Schatz O. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to the timer, dimeric constituents consisting of the acceptor (acceptor RNA·DNA) or donor (donor RNA·DNA) bound to the DNA were also examined. Finally, two additional structures based on the acceptor RNA·DNA were also used. In one the hybrid region between the acceptor and DNA was increased to 64 bases by moving the junction 10 bases toward the 3′-end of the DNA (termed acceptor RNA·DNA (+10 hybrid)). In the second the DNA was shortened by 29 bases at the 3′-end to produce a 64-nucleotide DNA. The resulting structure (termed acceptor RNA·DNA (recessed 3′-DNA)) eliminated the branch point of the original acceptor RNA·DNA structure and produced a recessed 3′-DNA terminus. To ensure that the appropriate structures were used, it was important to determine that the DNA remained associated with the RNA for both the duplexes and the trimeric structures. For all preparations of substrates obtained, this was verified by examination of the recovered material by native gel electrophoresis. As can be seen from Fig.2, the various complexes and single-stranded nucleic acids migrated to unique positions on the native gel. This allowed recovery of pure material and confirmation of the integrity of the isolated complexes. It should be noted that the acceptor RNA·DNA and trimer structures represent “model substrates” of intermediates occurring during strand transfer. An authentic trimeric transfer intermediate would contain an acceptor RNA that was complementary to the 3′-end of the DNA. Various conditions were used in an attempt to isolate “authentic” structures by first forming donor RNA·DNA, then adding acceptor RNA that was complementary to the complete DNA of the donor RNA·DNA. In all cases an acceptor RNA·DNA structure devoid of donor RNA was resolved on the native gels. Regardless, the model substrates that were produced should yield valuable information concerning the recognition of strand transfer intermediates by RT and the mechanism of RNase H cleavage on the substrates. RNase H cleavage assays done on heteroduplex structures provide information about the binding site of RT. When the donor RNA was bound to the DNA in the heteroduplex (donor RNA·DNA), results were as expected given the distance between the polymerase and RNase H active sites on RT and the 3′-5′ directional cleavage activity of RT (data not shown) (7Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 21DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24295-24301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,22Schatz O. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The enzyme initially cleaved the RNA ∼18 bases behind the 3′-end of the DNA, and the larger initial cleavage products were subsequently chased into smaller products over time by the 3′-5′ nuclease activity of the RT. This results in a shortening of the hybrid region between the DNA and RNA and eventually can cause dissociation of the nucleic acids. In the heteroduplex structure mimicking the binding of the acceptor RNA to the DNA, cleavage of the acceptor RNA was observed (Fig.3, acceptor RNA·DNA). This was in contrast to what had been reported previously. Work by others using RNA bound to single-stranded circular DNA suggested that RT could cleave structures with the 5′-end of the RNA not bound to the DNA. However, this was providing that the unbound 5′-RNA end was less than 12 nucleotides in length (11Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M. Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2063-2070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Based on these results alone it would be predicted that the acceptor RNA·DNA duplex would be resistant to cleavage, because the acceptor RNA has an unbound 5′-end that is 45 nucleotides away from the hybrid region (see “Discussion” also). Despite this results indicated that the RNA was cleaved. The product sizes at the early time points were diverse indicating that RT was initially bound to the structure such that the RNase H active site contacted the RNA at several positions. The shortest (and most prominent) RNA observed corresponded to cleavage 15 bases behind the junction of the RNA·DNA hybrid (60-nucleotide product). Products longer than 60 nucleotides were processed over time to produce more of the 60-base product, whereas small amounts of 56-nucleotide and shorter products were observed later in the reaction. Assays in which E. coli RNase H was added after RT digestion indicated that the 60-nucleotide RNA was still bound to the DNA (data not shown). Overall results suggested that, after somewhat random (although with a preference for sites near junction) initial cleavages, subsequent cleavages proceed toward the RNA·DNA junction. Processing at the junction to produce a small unstable hybrid region appeared to be slow. To compare the cleavage of the acceptor RNA·DNA substrate to cleavage of a more standard substrate with a 3′ recessed DNA termini, a 64-nucleotide DNA that bound the RNA and terminated at the end of the hybrid region was constructed (acceptor RNA·DNA (recessed 3′-DNA)). The DNA was identical to the first 64 bases at the 5′-end of the 93 base DNA used in the acceptor RNA·DNA substrate but was missing the 29 bases at the 3′-end. This configuration should direct RT cleavage ∼18 bases behind the DNA 3′ terminus (−18 position). Results of a cleavage assay are shown in Fig. 3 (acceptor RNA·DNA (recessed 3′-DNA)). Early time points revealed initial cleavages 19 (64-nucleotide product) and 16 (61-nucleotide product) bases behind the 3′-end. There were also some nonspecific cleavages that produced longer products but the −19 and −16 cleavages were clearly the most prominent. At later points cleavages at −11 (56 bases) were observed as the levels of the larger products decreased. The results indicate that cleavage on the standard substrate with a recessed 3′ terminus leads to the expected results with a large proportion of initial cleavages occurring from RT molecules bound at the 3′ terminus. Subsequent 3′-5′ processing results in many of these products being processed to smaller products that likely destabilize the RNA·DNA hybrid. In contrast, on the acceptor RNA·DNA the RNA·DNA junction only loosely directed cleavage and processing was partially inhibited (see above). To determine how the position of the junction affected cleavage a substrate was constructed in which the position of the junction was advanced by 10 nucleotides toward the 3′-end of the DNA. This produced an acceptor RNA·DNA substrate with a 64-base as opposed to a 54-base hybrid region. Results with this s"
