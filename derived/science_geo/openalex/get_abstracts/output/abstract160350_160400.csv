https://openalex.org/W2139653117,"Electromagnetically induced transparency is a quantum interference effect that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic medium; a 'coupling' laser is used to create the interference necessary to allow the transmission of resonant pulses from a 'probe' laser. This technique has been used to slow and spatially compress light pulses by seven orders of magnitude, resulting in their complete localization and containment within an atomic cloud. Here we use electromagnetically induced transparency to bring laser pulses to a complete stop in a magnetically trapped, cold cloud of sodium atoms. Within the spatially localized pulse region, the atoms are in a superposition state determined by the amplitudes and phases of the coupling and probe laser fields. Upon sudden turn-off of the coupling laser, the compressed probe pulse is effectively stopped; coherent information initially contained in the laser fields is 'frozen' in the atomic medium for up to 1 ms. The coupling laser is turned back on at a later time and the probe pulse is regenerated: the stored coherence is read out and transferred back into the radiation field. We present a theoretical model that reveals that the system is self-adjusting to minimize dissipative loss during the 'read' and 'write' operations. We anticipate applications of this phenomenon for quantum information processing."

Close to 75,000 cases of O157:H7 infection are now estimated to occur annually in the United States3. The severity of disease, the lack of effective treatment and the potential for large-scale outbreaks from contaminated food supplies have propelled intensive research on the pathogenesis and detection of E. coli O157:H7 (ref. 4). Here we have sequenced the genome of E. coli O157:H7 to identify candidate genes responsible for pathogenesis, to develop better methods of strain detection and to advance our understanding of the evolution of E. coli, through comparison with the genome of the non-pathogenic laboratory strain E. coli K-12 (ref. 5). We find that lateral gene transfer is far more extensive than previously anticipated. In fact, 1,387 new genes encoded in strain-specific clusters of diverse sizes were found in O157:H7. These include candidate virulence factors, alternative metabolic capacities, several prophages and other new functions—all of which could be targets for surveillance."

Disruption of the gene encoding the negative immunoregulatory receptor PD-1 in BALB/c mice, but not in BALB/c RAG-2-/- mice, caused dilated cardiomyopathy with severely impaired contraction and sudden death by congestive heart failure. Affected hearts showed diffuse deposition of immunoglobulin G (IgG) on the surface of cardiomyocytes. All of the affected PD-1-/- mice exhibited high-titer circulating IgG autoantibodies reactive to a 33-kilodalton protein expressed specifically on the surface of cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that PD-1 may be an important factor contributing to the prevention of autoimmune diseases."

Here we report the characterization of a dominant Arabidopsis mutant, yucca, which contains elevated levels of free auxin. YUCCA encodes a flavin monooxygenase-like enzyme and belongs to a family that includes at least nine other homologous Arabidopsis genes, a subset of which appears to have redundant functions. Results from tryptophan analog feeding experiments and biochemical assays indicate that YUCCA catalyzes hydroxylation of the amino group of tryptamine, a rate-limiting step in tryptophan-dependent auxin biosynthesis."

To explore its neural basis, we trained monkeys to categorize computer-generated stimuli as ""cats"" and ""dogs."" A morphing system was used to systematically vary stimulus shape and precisely define the category boundary. Neural activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex reflected the category of visual stimuli, even when a monkey was retrained with the stimuli assigned to new categories."
https://openalex.org/W2090985333,"The upper region of the outer root sheath of vibrissal follicles of adult mice contains multipotent stem cells that respond to morphogenetic signals to generate multiple hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and epidermis, i.e., all the lineages of the hairy skin. At the time when hair production ceases and when the lower region of the follicle undergoes major structural changes, the lower region contains a significant number of clonogenic keratinocytes, and can then respond to morphogenetic signals. This demonstrates that multipotent stem cells migrate to the root of the follicle to produce whisker growth. Moreover, our results indicate that the clonogenic keratinocytes are closely related, if not identical, to the multipotent stem cells, and that the regulation of whisker growth necessitates a precise control of stem cell trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W2041455826,"Chloride channels play important roles in the plasma membrane and in intracellular organelles. Mice deficient for the ubiquitously expressed ClC-7 Cl(-) channel show severe osteopetrosis and retinal degeneration. Although osteoclasts are present in normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone because they cannot acidify the extracellular resorption lacuna. ClC-7 resides in late endosomal and lysosomal compartments. In osteoclasts, it is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane, formed by the fusion of H(+)-ATPase-containing vesicles, that secretes protons into the lacuna. We also identified CLCN7 mutations in a patient with human infantile malignant osteopetrosis. We conclude that ClC-7 provides the chloride conductance required for an efficient proton pumping by the H(+)-ATPase of the osteoclast ruffled membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2115525122,"Conductivity measurements on double-stranded DNA molecules deposited by a combing process across a submicron slit between rhenium/carbon metallic contacts reveal conduction to be ohmic between room temperature and 1 kelvin. The resistance per molecule is less than 100 kilohm and varies weakly with temperature. Below the superconducting transition temperature (1 kelvin) of the contacts, proximity-induced superconductivity is observed. These results imply that DNA molecules can be conducting down to millikelvin temperature and that phase coherence is maintained over several hundred nanometers."
https://openalex.org/W2156697710,"Identifying natal origins of marine fishes is challenging because of difficulties in conducting mark-recapture studies in marine systems. We used natural geochemical signatures in otoliths (ear bones) to determine natal sources in weakfish ( Cynoscion regalis ), an estuarine-spawning marine fish, in eastern North America. Spawning site fidelity ranged from 60 to 81%, comparable to estimates of natal homing in birds and anadromous fishes. These data were in contrast to genetic analyses of population structure in weakfish. Our findings highlight the need for consideration of spatial processes in fisheries models and have implications for the design of marine reserves in coastal regions."

https://openalex.org/W2022605680,"The recessively inherited developmental disorder, cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) is highly pleiotropic with manifestations including short stature, defective cellular immunity, and predisposition to several cancers. The endoribonuclease RNase MRP consists of an RNA molecule bound to several proteins. It has at least two functions, namely, cleavage of RNA in mitochondrial DNA synthesis and nucleolar cleaving of pre-rRNA. We describe numerous mutations in the untranslated RMRP gene that cosegregate with the CHH phenotype. Insertion mutations immediately upstream of the coding sequence silence transcription while mutations in the transcribed region do not. The association of protein subunits with RNA appears unaltered. We conclude that mutations in RMRP cause CHH by disrupting a function of RNase MRP RNA that affects multiple organ systems."
https://openalex.org/W1997394068,"Molecular metals normally require charge transfer between two different chemical species. We prepared crystals of [Ni(tmdt) 2 ] (tmdt, trimethylenetetrathiafulvalenedithiolate) and carried out crystal structure analyses and resistivity measurements. The analyses and measurements revealed that these single-component molecular crystals are metallic from room temperature down to 0.6 kelvin. Ab initio molecular orbital calculations suggested that π molecular orbitals form conduction bands. The compact molecular arrangement, intermolecular overlap integrals of the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, and tight-binding electronic band structure calculation revealed that [Ni(tmdt) 2 ] is a three-dimensional synthetic metal composed of planar molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2017024661,We report the characterization of defects in individual metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes by transport measurements and scanned gate microscopy. A sizable fraction of metallic nanotubes grown by chemical vapor deposition exhibits strongly gate voltage–dependent resistance at room temperature. Scanned gate measurements reveal that this behavior originates from resonant electron scattering by defects in the nanotube as the Fermi level is varied by the gate voltage. The reflection coefficient at the peak of a scattering resonance was determined to be about 0.5 at room temperature. An intratube quantum dot device formed by two defects is demonstrated by low-temperature transport measurements.
https://openalex.org/W2088337203,"Little is known about the identity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) export signals and how they are used to regulate the number of proteins on the cell surface. Here, we describe two ER export signals that profoundly altered the steady-state distribution of potassium channels and were required for channel localization to the plasma membrane. When transferred to other potassium channels or a G protein-coupled receptor, these ER export signals increased the number of functional proteins on the cell surface. Thus, ER export of membrane proteins is not necessarily limited by folding or assembly, but may be under the control of specific export signals."

Fluids are manipulated via an electrocapillary pressure, originating from electrostatic control of the solid/fluid interfacial tension in the microchannels. Reversible fluid displacement has been achieved for all channel orientations with respect to gravity.

Of the three males born from 20 embryo transfers, one was transgenic when accessible tissues were assayed for transgene DNA and messenger RNA. All tissues that were studied from a fraternal set of twins, miscarried at 73 days, carried the transgene, as confirmed by Southern analyses, and the GFP transgene reporter was detected by both direct and indirect fluorescence imaging."
https://openalex.org/W2069886131,"The subthreshold, voltage-gated potassium channel of skeletal muscle is shown to contain MinK-related peptide 2 (MiRP2) and the pore-forming subunit Kv3.4. MiRP2-Kv3.4 channels differ from Kv3.4 channels in unitary conductance, voltage-dependent activation, recovery from inactivation, steady-state open probability, and block by a peptide toxin. Thus, MiRP2-Kv3.4 channels set resting membrane potential (RMP) and do not produce afterhyperpolarization or cumulative inactivation to limit action potential frequency. A missense mutation is identified in the gene for MiRP2 (KCNE3) in two families with periodic paralysis and found to segregate with the disease. Mutant MiRP2-Kv3.4 complexes exhibit reduced current density and diminished capacity to set RMP. Thus, MiRP2 operates with a classical potassium channel subunit to govern skeletal muscle function and pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W2072127205,"Hamilton's theory of kin selection suggests that individuals should show less aggression, and more altruism, towards closer kin. Recent theoretical work has, however, suggested that competition between relatives can counteract kin selection for altruism. Unfortunately, factors that tend to increase the average relatedness of interacting individuals--such as limited dispersal--also tend to increase the amount of competition between relatives. Therefore, in most natural systems, the conflicting influences of increased competition and increased relatedness are confounded, limiting attempts to test theory. Fig wasp taxa exhibit varying levels of aggression among non-dispersing males that show a range of average relatedness levels. Thus, across species, the effects of relatedness and competition between relatives can be separated. Here we report that--contrary to Hamilton's original prediction but in agreement with recent theory--the level of fighting between males shows no correlation with the estimated relatedness of interacting males, but is negatively correlated with future mating opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W2078977192,"Multishell helical gold nanowires were recently imaged by electron microscopy. We show theoretically that the contact with the gold tips at either end of the wire plays a crucial role and that local minima in the string tension rather than the total wire free energy determine the nanowire stability. Density functional electronic structure calculations of the simplest and thinnest coaxial gold and silver wires of variable radius and chirality were carried out. We found a string tension minimum for a single-tube gold nanowire that is chiral and consists of seven strands, in striking agreement with observation. In contrast, no such minimum was found for silver, where the s-d competition leading to surface reconstruction is lacking."
https://openalex.org/W2078300727,"15-lipoxygenase (LOX) expression is translationally silenced in early erythroid precursor cells by a specific mRNA-protein complex formed between the differentiation control element in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and hnRNPs K and E1. The 3'UTR regulatory complex prevents translation initiation by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that the 40S ribosomal subunit can be recruited and scan to the translation initiation codon even when the silencing complex is bound to the 3'UTR. However, the joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit at the AUG codon to form a translation competent 80S ribosome is inhibited, unless initiation is mediated by the IGR-IRES of the cricket paralysis virus. These findings identify the critical step at which LOX mRNA translation is controlled and reveal that 60S subunit joining can be specifically regulated."
https://openalex.org/W2134403233,"It is currently thought that all secretory proteins travel together to the Golgi apparatus where they are sorted to different destinations. However, the specific requirements for transport of GPI-anchored proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus in yeast could be explained if protein sorting occurs earlier in the pathway. Using an in vitro assay that reconstitutes a single round of budding from the endoplasmic reticulum, we found that GPI-anchored proteins and other secretory proteins exit the endoplasmic reticulum in distinct vesicles. Therefore, GPI-anchored proteins are sorted from other proteins, in particular other plasma membrane proteins, at an early stage of the secretory pathway. These results have wide implications for the mechanism of protein exit from the endoplasmic reticulum."

https://openalex.org/W2079312523,The replacement theory of modern human origins stipulates that populations outside of Africa were replaced by a new African species of modern humans. Here we test the replacement theory in two peripheral areas far from Africa by examining the ancestry of early modern Australians and Central Europeans. Analysis of pairwise differences was used to determine if dual ancestry in local archaic populations and earlier modern populations from the Levant and/or Africa could be rejected. The data imply that both have a dual ancestry. The diversity of recent humans cannot result exclusively from a single Late Pleistocene dispersal.
https://openalex.org/W2017317217,"Human cytomegalovirus infects vascular tissues and has been associated with atherogenesis and coronary restenosis. Although established laboratory strains of human cytomegalovirus have lost the ability to grow on vascular endothelial cells, laboratory strains of murine cytomegalovirus retain this ability. With the use of a forward-genetic procedure involving random transposon mutagenesis and rapid phenotypic screening, we identified a murine cytomegalovirus gene governing endothelial cell tropism. This gene, M45, shares sequence homology to ribonucleotide reductase genes. Endothelial cells infected with M45-mutant viruses rapidly undergo apoptosis, suggesting that a viral strategy to evade destruction by cellular apoptosis is indispensable for viral growth in endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2017716401,"We identified a signaling pathway that prevents initiation of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis when replication initiation is impaired. We isolated mutations that allow a replication initiation mutant (dnaA) to sporulate. These mutations affect a small open reading frame, sda, that was overexpressed in replication initiation mutants and appears to be directly regulated by DnaA. Mutations in replication initiation genes inhibit the onset of sporulation by preventing activation of a transcription factor required for sporulation, Spo0A. Deletion of sda restored activation of Spo0A in replication initiation mutants. Overexpression of sda in otherwise wild-type cells inhibited activation of Spo0A and sporulation. Purified Sda inhibited a histidine kinase needed for activation of Spo0A. Our results indicate that control of sda by DnaA establishes a checkpoint that inhibits activation of Spo0A and prevents futile attempts to initiate sporulation."

https://openalex.org/W1973962258,"During homologous recombination, DNA strand exchange leads to Holliday junction formation. The movement, or branch migration, of this junction along DNA extends the length of the heteroduplex joint. In prokaryotes, branch migration and Holliday junction resolution are catalyzed by the RuvA and RuvB proteins, which form a complex with RuvC resolvase to form a ""resolvasome"". Mammalian cell-free extracts have now been fractionated to reveal analogous activities. An ATP-dependent branch migration activity, which migrates junctions through >2700 bp, cofractionates with the Holliday junction resolvase during several chromatographic steps. Together, the two activities promote concerted branch migration/resolution reactions similar to those catalyzed by E. coli RuvABC, highlighting the preservation of this essential pathway in recombination and DNA repair from prokaryotes to mammals."

Although the function of the BRCA2 protein remains to be determined, murine cells homozygous for BRCA2 inactivation display chromosomal aberrations. We have isolated a 2 MDa BRCA2-containing complex and identified a structural DNA binding component, designated as BRCA2-Associated Factor 35 (BRAF35). BRAF35 contains a nonspecific DNA binding HMG domain and a kinesin-like coiled coil domain. Similar to BRCA2, BRAF35 mRNA expression levels in mouse embryos are highest in proliferating tissues with high mitotic index. Strikingly, nuclear staining revealed a close association of BRAF35/BRCA2 complex with condensed chromatin coincident with histone H3 phosphorylation. Importantly, antibody microinjection experiments suggest a role for BRCA2/BRAF35 complex in modulation of cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2019781988,"Planetary nebulae are thought to be formed when a slow wind from the progenitor giant star is overtaken by a subsequent fast wind generated as the star enters its white dwarf stage$^{1}$. A shock forms near the boundary between the winds, which creates a relatively dense shell that provides the characteristic appearance of a planetary nebula. A spherically symmetric wind will produce a spherically symmetric shell, yet over half of known planetary nebulae are not spherical; rather, they are elliptical or bipolar in shape$^{2}$. While a magnetic field could launch and collimate a bipolar outflow, the origin of such a field has hitherto been unclear, as previous work suggested that a field could not be generated${^3}$. Here we show that an asymptotic-giant-branch (AGB) star can indeed generate a strong magnetic field, in a dynamo at the interface between a rapidly rotating core and the more slowly rotating envelope of the star. The field is strong enough to shape the bipolar outflows that produce the observed bipolar planetary nebulae. Magnetic braking of the stellar core during this process may also explain the puzzlingly$^{4}$ slow rotation of most white dwarf stars."

However, the validity of this theory remains uncertain, and independent sea-level chronologies used to test its applicability have been restricted largely to the past approximately 135,000 years. Here, we report U-series ages for coral reefs formed on Henderson Island during sea-level high-stands occurring at approximately 630,000 and approximately 330,000 years ago. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that interglacial climates are forced by Northern Hemisphere summer solar insolation centered at 65 degrees N latitude, as predicted by Milankovitch theory."

https://openalex.org/W1999578749,"Flight directions of birds migrating at high geographic and magnetic latitudes can be used to test bird orientation by celestial or geomagnetic compass systems under polar conditions. Migration patterns of arctic shorebirds, revealed by tracking radar studies during an icebreaker expedition along the Northwest Passage in 1999, support predicted sun compass trajectories but cannot be reconciled with orientation along either geographic or magnetic loxodromes (rhumb lines). Sun compass routes are similar to orthodromes (great circle routes) at high latitudes, showing changing geographic courses as the birds traverse longitudes and their internal clock gets out of phase with local time. These routes bring the shorebirds from high arctic Canada to the east coast of North America, from which they make transoceanic flights to South America. The observations are also consistent with a migration link between Siberia and the Beaufort Sea region by way of sun compass routes across the Arctic Ocean."

It has a structure unlike any class I cytokine receptor described thus far, forming a stable interlocking dimer in the absence of ligand in which the G strand of domain 1 hydrogen bonds into the corresponding beta sheet of domain 3 of the dimer-related molecule.

In contrast to the two yeast models, analysis of DmCKII has been stymied, principally due to the absence of mutations, even though the cDNAs encoding DmCKII were the first to be isolated (23Saxena A. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3409-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, two complementary approaches that have recently been applied to DmCKII have proven to be exceptionally useful for analyzing functions of this kinase in a metazoan context. The first of these is the two-hybrid system (24Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) that has been used to identify CKII interacting proteins, many of which appear to be potential substrates of this kinase. The second is genetic analysis on these interacting proteins via targeted misexpression of transgenes encoding nonphosphorylatable and constitutively phosphorylated variants using the Gal4-UAS system (25Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by phenotypic analysis. Studies along these lines have identified a novel regulatory (β′) subunit of DmCKII (9Bidwai A.P. Zhao W.F. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the case of ANTP, phosphorylation by DmCKII appears necessary for restricting its activity during embryogenesis. A somewhat similar situation exists for another homeobox protein, Engrailed, which also appears to be regulated by CKII-mediated phosphorylation (28Bourbon H.M. Martin-Blanco E. Rosen D.

In addition, the segment polarity protein Dishevelled, a component of the wingless/Wnt signaling pathway (29Hunter T.

Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that CKII plays crucial roles in embryonic development as well as in cellular differentiation.In an attempt to better define the physiological role of CKII, we have used the two-hybrid approach (24Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4822) Google Scholar) to identify and characterize physiological partners of the α subunit of DmCKII (DmCKIIα). One of the proteins identified in this screen is m7, a bHLH-type transcription factor derived from the neurogenic locus E(spl)C (31Campos-Ortega J.A. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). TheE(spl)C encodes the structurally and functionally similar bHLH proteins mC (also known as mδ), mB (also known as mγ), mA (also known as mβ), m3, m5, m7, and m8 (32Delidakis C.

E(spl)C-derived bHLH proteins have been proposed to inhibit neurogenesis via transcriptional repression of proneural genes by binding the N-box sequence, CACNAG (41Oellers N. Dehio M. Knust E. Mol.

Genet. 1996; 251: 628-634PubMed Google Scholar).The studies described in this report demonstrate that in addition to m7, DmCKIIα also interacts with two other E(spl) proteins, m5 and m8, and that all three proteins are phosphorylated by DmCKII in vitro. Protein-protein interaction analysis demonstrates a direct physical association between m8 and Drosophila embryo CKII. Using site-directed mutagenesis in combination with phosphorylation and two-hybrid analyses, we have mapped the site of phosphorylation, and we demonstrate that replacement of the phosphoacceptor Ser with Ala (a nonphosphorylatable residue) attenuates interaction of m8 with CKII, whereas substitution with Asp (which mimics the constitutively phosphorylated protein) abolishes the interaction. These studies demonstrate that the bHLH proteins m5, m7, and m8 are new physiological partners and substrates of DmCKII. Casein kinase II (CKII)1is a ubiquitous protein kinase that is highly conserved among eukaryotes (1Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar, 2Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 383-390PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of functioning as an oncogene in mammals (3Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). CKII is composed of catalytic (α) and regulatory (β) subunits that combine to form an α2β2holoenzyme. With the exceptions of Drosophila melanogaster(4Glover C.V.C. Shelton E.R. Brutlag D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3256-3258Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), Caenorhabditis elegans (5Hu E. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5072-5080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (6Roussou I. Dretta G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 576-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CKII from most eukaryotic organisms contains two α subunits, α and α′, that are encoded by distinct genes. In contrast, β subunit heterogeneity has been documented via protein microchemical approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (7Bidwai A.P. Reed J.C. Glover C.V.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 309: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and via molecular/genetic approaches inArabidopsis thaliana (8Collinge M.A. Walker J.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 649-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and D. melanogaster(9Bidwai A.P. Zhao W.F. Glover C.V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 1999; 1: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CKII preferentially phosphorylates Ser/Thr residues in an hyperacidic context (10Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although phosphorylation of Tyr has been documented in at least one case, i.e. yeast Fpr3 (11Wilson L.K. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Martin G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12961-12967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Analysis of the phosphorylation of synthetic peptides suggests that the consensus site for phosphorylation by CKII can best be described as (S/T)(D/E)X(D/E) (10Kuenzel E.A. Mulligan J.A. Sommercorn J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9136-9140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, a number of proteins critical for transcription, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction contain such a site(s) and are known to be phosphorylated in vitro and in vivo (12Glover C.V.C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Although CKII activity is inhibited in vitro by polyacidic compounds, such as polyaspartate and polyglutamate (13Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Marchiori F. Borin G.

Comparisons between recombinant monomeric α subunit and native or reconstituted α2β2 holoenzyme have revealed that the β subunit plays a complex role in regulating the basal activity of the α subunit (15Bidwai A.P.
