https://openalex.org/W1502101722,"The levels of intermediary metabolites in the perfused liver have been measured to determine the location of the rate-limiting step for gluconeogenesis from lactate and the site at which glucagon, epinephrine, and cyclic AMP exert control. The reaction limiting maximum gluconeogenesis from lactate is situated between pyruvate and phosphopyruvate. Glucagon or epinephrine, acting through cyclic AMP, appears to activate a reaction in this portion of the pathway. At less than saturating levels of lactate, the rate of gluconeogenesis is determined by the activities of the above reaction and also of lactate dehydrogenase. The latter step is not under hormonal control. Gluconeogenesis is not limited by the supply of NAD+ or NADH and is virtually independent of the oxidation-reduction potential of the extramitochondrial NAD+-NADH couple as reflected by the lactate-pyruvate ratio of the tissue. The liver has potent mechanisms to restore a displaced oxidation-reduction potential to normal. Glucagon does not stimulate gluconeogenesis or inhibit lactate formation from fructose or dihydroxyacetone. It is suggested that a sparing of pyruvate oxidation or inhibition of the pyruvate kinase reaction is not responsible for the gluconeogenic action of glucagon and that effects, if any, of glucagon on reactions at the level of triose phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose diphosphatase, or glucose 6-phosphatase are of no physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W2092053510,"AFTER the destruction of sympathetic nerve endings by 6-hydroxydopamine1,2, there is a compensatory increase in the catecholamine synthesis and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the adrenal gland3. We have examined the actions of reserpine and phenoxybenzamine on adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase activity. These drugs, like 6-hydroxydopamine2, interfere with postganglionic sympathetic transmission, but by different mechanisms4–6. We also studied the alterations of this enzyme in an embryologically related tissue, the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion. Reserpine and phenoxybenzamine increased the activity of adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase, and reserpine also increased the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase in the superior cervical ganglion. This increase in enzyme activity was prevented by interruption of nerve impulses by decentralization."

This effect cannot be produced by much larger doses of vitamin D(3). Comparison of stimulation of bone resorption by 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and parathyroid hormone reveals similarities with respect to time course, dose-response slope, and inhibition by calcitonin."
https://openalex.org/W1498183849,Abstract Wheat germ cytochrome c contains 2 residues of e-N-trimethyllysine (lysine betaine) at positions 72 and 86. Neurospora cytochrome c possesses this lysine derivative at Residue 72. No trace of e-N-methyl- or e-N-dimethyllysine was found in these proteins. Residue 72 is present in the sequence comprising Residues 70 through 80 which is invariant in all cytochromes of this type and Residue 86 is present in a region which is characterized in almost all cytochromes as being either Lys-Lys or Lys-Lys-Lys. Some possible implications of these findings with respect to the interaction of cytochrome c with cytochrome oxidase are discussed.
https://openalex.org/W1511531751,"Abstract The stereochemistry of the ketosidic bond of sialic acid has been elucidated by a study of the two anomeric methyl ketosides. Isomer I was prepared by Koenigs-Knorr synthesis, and isomer II by direct methylation with methanol and an acid catalyst. These two anomeric configurations were established by conversion with periodate-borohydride to III and IV, respectively, followed by lactonization of one isomer. Dreiding models demonstrate that only one anomer is potentially able to lactonize, and this was accordingly assigned Structure IV. This anomer and its precursor (II) were resistant to neuraminidase, whereas Compounds I and III were hydrolyzed by the enzyme. The configuration of the ketosidic bond of sialic acid in naturally occurring substances, such as gangliosides, glycoproteins, and the like, is therefore the less stable anomer I, with the ketosidic bond equatorial and the carboxyl group axial to the pyranoid ring. It is assigned the α-d configuration in accordance with the rules of nomenclature."

Adrenocorticotropin treatment elevates concentrations of this steroid in plasma, and inhibitors of adrenocorticotropin or progesterone biosynthesis lower the concentration. Adrenocorticotropin controls progesterone secretion by the adrenal but not by the ovary. Adrenal progesterone and its mode of control may have important influences on reproductive processes."
https://openalex.org/W1589700202,"An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-sensitive, steroid-producing mouse adrenal tumor was homogenized and fractionated by differential centrifugation. The adenyl cyclase activity that was stimulated by ACTH and by fluoride was purified 10- to 20-fold and localized to particulate fractions. The enzyme activity was not affected by several other polypeptide hormones, by epinephrine, or by prostaglandin PGE1. The ACTH-induced increase in adenyl cyclase activity was maximal at pH 7.4 to pH 7.7. The optimal Mg2+:ATP ratio was 1 to 1.5. Enzyme activity in the presence of ACTH was decreased by Ca2+, Na+, K+, and propranolol. Other nucleotides at equimolar concentrations to ATP also decreased the ACTH effect to a variable extent; dATP was the most effective inhibitor."

https://openalex.org/W1652310094,"Abstract Procedures are described for the purification from extracts of Escherichia coli of the two enzymes necessary for the synthesis of dihydropteroic acid (H2-pteroate) from 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine (H2-pteridine-CH2OH) and p-aminobenzoic acid in the presence of ATP. We have shown that the first enzyme, which has been named H2-pteridine-CH2OH pyrophosphokinase, catalyzes a reaction whereby H2-pteridine-CH2OH and ATP are used for the formation of a product that has been identified as the pyrophosphate ester of H2-pteridine-CH2OH. Since the other product of the reaction has been identified as AMP, the reaction is characterized as an enzyme-catalyzed transfer of a pyrophosphate group. Mg2+ is needed for the enzyme to function. The Km values for H2-pteridine-CH2OH and ATP are both 1.5 x 10-5 m. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 15,000 and the enzyme is relatively heat-stable. The second enzyme, which has been named H2-pteroate synthetase, catalyzes the synthesis of H2-pteroate from p-aminobenzoic acid and the pyrophosphate ester of H2pteridine-CH2OH. Inorganic pyrophosphate has been identified as the other product of the reaction and Mg2+ is required for this enzyme to function. The Km value for aminobenzoic acid is 2.5 x 10-6 m. The molecular weight of the enzyme is approximately 50,000."
https://openalex.org/W1494650850,"Abstract Rat liver mitochondria metabolize glutarate at a very slow rate as compared with glutaryl coenzyme A. The stimulatory effect of citric acid cycle intermediates, NAD, and coenzyme A on glutarate metabolism was interpreted as a manifestation of their involvement in the activation of glutarate by a thiol transferase with succinyl-CoA as the coenzyme A donor. Glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the stoichiometric conversion of glutaryl-CoA to 1 mole each of carbon dioxide and crotonyl-CoA or its intermediate metabolite, was purified approximately 44- and 100-fold from bovine liver and kidney mitochondria, respectively. The enzyme was shown to require an artificial electron acceptor and to be further stimulated by exogenous FAD. Of the various electron acceptors tested, methylene blue and phenazine methosulfate were most effective. The enzymes from both sources have similar properties. Catalysis was optimum at pH 7.5 in potassium phosphate buffer and at pH 8.0 in Tris-HCl buffer. The enzyme activity was inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate. The Km for glutaryl-CoA was 3.3 µm. Glutaconyl-CoA, the suspected primary intermediate of glutaryl-CoA metabolism, was synthesized, and its effect on the oxidation of glutaryl-CoA and its role as an alternative substrate for the partially purified enzyme were studied. Kinetic results indicated that glutaconyl-CoA competitively inhibited the release of 14CO2 from glutaryl-CoA-1,5-14C possibly because of the metabolism of glutaconyl-CoA by the enzyme. Thus far, attempts to isolate enzymatically formed glutaconyl-CoA and to separate the dehydrogenation and decarboxylation activities of the enzyme have been unsuccessful."

https://openalex.org/W1958752407,"Abstract 1. DNA-dependent RNA polymerase has been isolated and purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The yeast enzyme resembles the polymerase from Escherichia coli and other sources in its absolute requirements for a DNA primer, a divalent cation, and all four nucleoside triphosphates. 2. Yeast RNA polymerase differs fundamentally from other RNA polymerases in its marked preference for a denatured template. With a wide variety of DNA preparations, the extent of RNA synthesis is more than 10-fold greater with a denatured than with a native template. 3. In contrast to E. coli polymerase, RNA chains formed with yeast polymerase from denatured calf thymus and T2 DNA have long average chain lengths of 1500 to 2000 nucleotides. 4. The effects of yeast and E. coli polymerases on the retention of native DNA by nitrocellulose membranes, on the partitioning of DNA by polyethylene glycol-dextran, and on the rate of RNA synthesis from dAT copolymer at various temperatures have been compared. These studies suggest that the yeast enzyme has a decreased ability to cause localized denaturation of native DNA compared to the E. coli enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1553796732,"The molecular weight of the thermophilic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was evaluated by the sedimentation equilibrium method and found to be 163,500 ± 4,000. The s20, w0 is 7.17 × 10−13 sec; the D20, w0 is 3.95 × 10−7 cm2 sec−1. Using electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips, the isoelectric pH was found to be approximately 4.6. The amino acid composition of the enzyme is quite similar to counterparts from other sources; there are 1,384 amino acid residues per molecule. The enzyme contains 4 eq of bound NAD+ and four sulfhydryl groups and these findings in conjunction with the amino acid content are indicative of a tetrameric structure. Levels of hydrophobicity were calculated for the thermophilic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and compared with proteins from other sources. The average hydrophobicity of the thermophilic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to be close to that of other glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases and it was concluded that this parameter need not be an indication of thermostability. The general similarities between the thermophilic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase described here and other glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenases make a mechanism of thermophily for this enzyme unclear. Further structural work is in progress to elucidate a mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1507999251,"Abstract A concentrated solution of pyrocatechase having a pronounced red color showed a sharp electron spin resonance signal at g = 4.28 known to be due to the high spin state of ferric ion. The signal markedly decreased upon the addition of sodium dithionite and was restored when the solution was exposed to air. The signal also decreased accompanied by a loss of the enzyme activity under a variety of conditions. When the substrate, catechol, was added to the enzyme under anaerobic conditions, the signal at g = 4.28 disappeared instantaneously. The signal was restored to the original level after all of the substrate was degraded to cis, cis-muconic acid by the addition of air. o-Phenanthroline removed iron from pyrocatechase only when it was added in the presence of sodium dithionite. The decrease in enzyme activity occurred in parallel with the increase in absorbance at 508 mµ due to the formation of a Fe(II)-o-phenanthroline complex. This complex could be separated from enzyme protein by exhaustive dialysis. The colorless inactive protein thus obtained showed essentially no signal in the vicinity of g = 4.2 and contained about 10% of the total iron as determined by the o-phenanthroline method. Upon incubation of this preparation with ferrous ion in the presence of oxygen the signal, as well as the red color, was partially restored with simultaneous reactivation of the enzyme. Other metals including ferric ion did not cause significant reactivation. The removal of iron was prevented by the substrate, catechol, and the concentration of catechol required for half-maximal protection was estimated to be in the same order of magnitude as the Km value for catechol in the catalytic reaction. In light of the above findings, the role of ferric ion in the action of pyrocatechase is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1492570491,"Abstract The respiratory apparatus of bacteria appears to be associated with the cytoplasmic membrane. The particulate structures obtained by differential centrifugation of cell-free extracts contained the bulk of the respiratory activity of the cell and are referred to as the electron transport particles. This material, however, was not homogenous and was further separated into a number of distinct particulate fractions by density gradient centrifugation. The heaviest fraction appeared as a red pellet, comprised about 28% of the total particulate protein, and was found to contain the complete electron transport pathways for succinate and NAD+-linked oxidations. However, this fraction failed to couple phosphorylation to oxidation even in the presence of soluble coupling factors. Restoration of phosphorylation to the electron transport particles was found to require one of the light particulate fractions and soluble coupling factors. The light particulate fraction had little or no oxidative activity and was active in restoring phosphorylation even after prolonged exposure to sonic oscillation. Reassociation of the light and heavy particles required the presence of Mg++ ions. The light particulate fraction was required for restoration of phosphorylation with different electron donors as well as for the third phosphorylative site."
https://openalex.org/W1971654052,"Three adult cats were deprived of rapid eye movement sleep for six separate periods of up to 32 days. Animals were allowed normal amounts of sleeping time during which rapid eye movement sleep was interrupted, whenever it occurred, by human observers who continually monitored the animals and their electrocortical activity. Cortical responses evoked by pairs of acoustic clicks were recorded during wakefulness. Recovery functions derived from these data were facilitated during periods of deprivation of rapid eye movement sleep and returned to base-line values when animals were allowed normal amounts of this sleep phase. This change was noted repeatedly within, as well as between, subjects. It did not occur during control periods when non-rapid eye movement sleep was interrupted on identical schedules, nor did it occur when the cats were deprived of all sleep for 22 hours a day for 5 days."

https://openalex.org/W1527696143,Abstract Polydeoxythymidylate in which the 5'-terminal phosphate is linked by a pyrophosphate bond to adenosine 5'-phosphate (poly dT-adenylate) serves as an intermediate in the reactions catalyzed by the Escherichia coli and T4-induced polynucleotide joining enzymes in the presence of polydeoxyadenylate. Adenosine 5'-phosphate release and phosphodiester bond formation occur stoichiometrically and with the same time course. The reaction is inhibited by DPN; hence it may be inferred that enzyme-adenylate is inactive in the reaction. The Km of the E. coli joining enzyme for poly dT-adenylate is 1 to 3 µm; the Km for poly dT is 0.003 µm. The specific activity of the E. coli enzyme measured at saturating substrate concentrations is 2 to 5 times higher with poly dT-adenylate than with poly dT.
https://openalex.org/W1816148094,"Abstract Two enzymes which effected the hydrolysis of the histidine biosynthetic intermediate histidinol phosphate were isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The enzymes were separated by diethylaminoethyl Sephadex column chromatography and partially characterized. The histidinol phosphatase was shown to be a specific enzyme, hydrolyzing only the histidine intermediate, histidinol phosphate. It was insensitive to inhibition by Be++ ions or EDTA. The alkaline phosphomonoesterase hydrolyzed a variety of phosphomonoesters, including histidinol phosphate. It was very sensitive to inhibition by Be++, and required Mg++ for maximal activity. A mutant lacking histidinol phosphatase was found to have the normal (wild type) level of the nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. The possibility that this enzyme can substitute for histidinol phosphatase under certain circumstances is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1571638172,"In order to resolve conflicting reports in the literature, the optical rotatory dispersion and far ultraviolet absorption spectrum of myosin, and in particular heavy meromyosin, have been examined in the presence and absence of ATP and the specific inhibitor, pyrophosphate. By neither criterion is there a measurable change and it is concluded that any change in the α-helix content is less than 0.2%; i.e. it involves fewer than about 6 residues per molecule of myosin. Changes in the binding capacity for bromothymol blue are observed when ATP or pyrophosphate is added to myosin or heavy meromyosin, which supports the view that a small conformational change occurs. The absence of any gross deformation of the myosin molecule by substrate or inhibitor has been established by a difference sedimentation method. Some implications of the findings in relation to current concepts of myosin function are considered."

https://openalex.org/W1603792575,"Abstract The binding of NADH to rabbit muscle l-α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase is accompanied by a considerable enhancement of the fluorescence of the reduced coenzyme which was used to study the properties of this binding process. Fluorescence titration of the enzyme with NADH indicated the binding of 2 moles of NADH per mole of enzyme (78,000 g). The dissociation constant for the NADH-enzyme complex was determined to be 1.8 x 10-6 m. Adenylic acid, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine diphosphoribose were shown to be NADH-competitive inhibitors in the l-α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate. A competitive relationship between the binding of adenylic acid and NADH was also shown with fluorescence enhancement techniques. Peptide-mapping studies of trypsin digests of l-α-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase revealed the presence in this enzyme of two identical subunits of 39,000 molecular weight."

https://openalex.org/W2994541539,"Abstract A particulate enzyme fraction was isolated from mung bean seedlings which catalyzed the transfer of mannose from guanosine diphosphate d-mannose-14C and glucose from GDP-d-glucose-14C into an alkali-insoluble glucomannan. The incorporation of 14C-glucose into the polysaccharide was dependent on the presence of GDP-d-mannose in the incubation mixtures, whereas the incorporation of 14C-mannose was strongly inhibited by adding GDP-d-glucose. Mg++ was required for the incorporation of mannose but not for glucose incorporation; the optimum concentration of Mg++ was about 1 x 10-2 m. Both reactions showed a sharp pH optimum at 7.5 in Tris buffer and were slightly inhibited by phosphate buffer. Complete hydrolysis of the insoluble polysaccharide synthesized from GDP-d-mannose-14C released most of the radioactivity as 14C-mannose, although traces of activity were also present in glucose. On the other hand, in the polysaccharide synthesized from GDP-d-glucose-14C and GDP-d-mannose, all of the radioactivity was in glucose. The insoluble polysaccharide was characterized by the examination of the soluble 14C-oligosaccharides released by a variety of treatments including enzymatic hydrolysis, partial acid hydrolysis, or acetolysis. From the 14C-mannose-labeled polymer a number of oligosaccharides were isolated which had varying ratios of mannose to glucose from 1:1 to 3 or 4:1. A 14C-disaccharide was isolated and partially identified as β-d-mannopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose. An identical 14C-disaccharide was isolated from the polymer synthesized in the presence of GDP-d-glucose-14C and GDP-d-mannose, except that the radioactivity was in glucose. The identity of these disaccharides indicated that 14C-mannose and 14C-glucose were incorporated into the same polymer. The disaccharides as well as the polymer were susceptible to hydrolysis by enzymes that cleaved β linkages. Methylation and then hydrolysis of several of the 14C-mannose-labeled oligosaccharides or the 14C-mannose-labeled insoluble polymer liberated two radioactive methylated sugars which were tentatively identified as 2,3,4,6-tetramethylmannose and 2,3,6-trimethylmannose, suggesting a 1 → 4-linked polymer. The linkage was confirmed by periodate oxidation studies. Complete oxidation of several of the 14C-mannose-labeled oligosaccharides followed by reduction and hydrolysis led to the formation of 14C-glycerol and 14C-erythritol, indicating that the 14C-mannose was attached by 1 → 4 linkages. Radioactive erythritol was also obtained from a 14C-glucose-labeled oligosaccharide. Based on the mannose to glucose ratios in the larger oligosaccharides, the product formed from GDP-d-mannose-14C or GDP-d-glucose-14C (in the presence of GDP-d-mannose) appears to be a β-(1 → 4)-linked glucomannan containing 3 or 4 mannose units per glucose molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1486547388,"Abstract l-α-Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase was shown to be inhibited by a homologous series of aliphatic carboxylic acids ranging in size from formic to dodecanoic acid, inclusive. The inhibition obtained was observed to be competitive with respect to the coenzyme, NAD, and noncompetitive with respect to substrate. The binding of carboxylic acids to the enzyme was shown to increase with increasing chain length of these inhibitors. Multiple inhibition studies were used to show that, in binding to the dehydrogenase, the carboxylic acids utilize the pyrophosphate and hydrophobic regions of the NAD-binding sites. It is suggested that nonpolar interactions with the same hydrophobic region facilitate the binding of carboxylic acids, N1-alkylnicotinamide chlorides, and n-alkylammonium chlorides to this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1513763159,"Abstract The effects of a number of nonionic organic solutes in high concentrations on the processes of oxidative phosphorylation and related reactions were examined. Polyhydroxyl compounds such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, and sucrose produced a reversible inhibition of the processes studied. The inhibition observed was almost identical in nature and magnitude for these solutes when the concentration was calculated on the basis of per cent by volume. Two nonionic, nonhydroxyl compounds, dimethylsulfoxide and dimethylformamide, were somewhat more inhibitory, and the inhibition observed at higher concentrations was partially irreversible. Monohydroxyl alcohols such as n-propyl alcohol were much more inhibitory, and the inhibition was to a large extent irreversible. Of the reactions studied, the 32Pi-ATP exchange, ATPase, and the energy-linked reduction of DPN+ by succinate were inhibited by the polyhydroxyl compounds in a similar manner but with the sensitivity to the solutes decreasing in the above order. In all cases the inhibition curve obtained with increasing concentrations of solute was sigmoid. Phosphate esterification during oxidative phosphorylation was likewise inhibited in a similar manner although the P:O ratio declined more gradually owing to a coincident inhibition of respiration. The energy-linked transhydrogenase activity, in contrast, showed an inhibition curve which was logarithmic with increasing levels of solute. It was concluded from these studies that the action of the polyhydroxyl solutes, at least, was related to the decrease in water content of the reaction mixture, but that this was not a simple linear phenomenon. In addition, kinetic data appeared to indicate that some sort of competitive relation existed between the solutes and Mg++ or Mg-ATP, at least in the 32Pi-ATP exchange and ATPase reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2019633566,"Abstract The fluorescence emission intensity at 460 nm of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in solution is increased in the presence of deuterium oxide over that observed in water. The increase in fluorescence intensity is a linear function of D2O concentration, and in 75 volume % D2O equals 20%. A similar increase is observed with N-methyl-dihydronicotinamide, reduced 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide, and phosphodiesterase-hydrolyzed NADH. The D2O perturbation of NADH fluorescence is reduced in binary complexes of NADH-alcohol dehydrogenase and in ternary complexes of NADH-alcohol dehydrogenase-inhibitor. The data indicate that the altered sensitivity of the bound coenzyme to D2O results from an interaction of the nicotinamide moiety with the enzyme protein and is not simply the result of unfolding of the coenzyme molecule with complex formation."

Isolated fat cells were exposed to N-ethylmaleimide for 10 sec before N-ethylmaleimide was inactivated by the addition of glutathione. This treatment resulted in inhibition of the lipolytic effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone, theophylline, and N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. The simplest interpretation of these results is that sulfhydryl groups are essential for the activation of triglyceride lipase."

In a further attempt to characterize this resonance, non-aqueous solvents were used as washing agents and no resonances were consistently obtained in the prepared mineral. Subsequently, spectroscopic examination of the distilled water has shown it to contain 0.02–0.2 mg of copper/l. This and the virtual identity of the resonance shape with that of the absorbed cupric ion3–6 leave little doubt that the previously reported resonance from bone mineral was a powder spectrum of the adsorbed cupric ion. The same is also true of the similar resonance found in extracted bone collagen. We have now found no consistent resonances from bone mineral when it is rinsed free of the solvent in distilled–deionized water. This agrees with the results of a spectrographic analysis of the bone mineral similarly prepared (Table 1)."

https://openalex.org/W1969113261,"Irradiation of the electron transport particles of Mycobacterium phlei with light at a wavelength of 360 manometers resulted in a loss of oxidase activities of succinate and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The lesion in the two pathways caused by irradiation of the particles differs. The succinoxidase pathway was more labile to irradiation than the pathway linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Restoration of succinoxidase activity (up to 50 to 60 percent) occurred on addition of a thermostable, water-soluble material obtained from Mycobacterium phlei cells or with an extract of mitochondria from boiled rat liver. Other known cofactors, such as flavine adenine dinucleotide, flavine mononucleotide, benzo- and naphthoquinones, as well as sulfhydryl agents, failed to restore succinoxidase activity after irradiation. Water-soluble material from Mycobacterium phlei appears to function between the flavoprotein and cytochrome b on the succinoxidase pathway. In contrast to the requirements for restoration of the pathway linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, restoration of succinoxidase does not occur with quinones or other cofactors such as flavine adenine dinucleotide."
