https://openalex.org/W1979158913,"The antigenic evolution of influenza A (H3N2) virus was quantified and visualized from its introduction into humans in 1968 to 2003. Although there was remarkable correspondence between antigenic and genetic evolution, significant differences were observed: Antigenic evolution was more punctuated than genetic evolution, and genetic change sometimes had a disproportionately large antigenic effect. The method readily allows monitoring of antigenic differences among vaccine and circulating strains and thus estimation of the effects of vaccination. Further, this approach offers a route to predicting the relative success of emerging strains, which could be achieved by quantifying the combined effects of population level immune escape and viral fitness on strain evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2085991080,"The human population and its consumption profoundly affect the Earth's ecosystems. A particularly compelling measure of humanity's cumulative impact is the fraction of the planet's net primary production that we appropriate for our own use. Net primary production--the net amount of solar energy converted to plant organic matter through photosynthesis--can be measured in units of elemental carbon and represents the primary food energy source for the world's ecosystems. Human appropriation of net primary production, apart from leaving less for other species to use, alters the composition of the atmosphere, levels of biodiversity, energy flows within food webs and the provision of important ecosystem services. Here we present a global map showing the amount of net primary production required by humans and compare it to the total amount generated on the landscape. We then derive a spatial balance sheet of net primary production 'supply' and 'demand' for the world. We show that human appropriation of net primary production varies spatially from almost zero to many times the local primary production. These analyses reveal the uneven footprint of human consumption and related environmental impacts, indicate the degree to which human populations depend on net primary production 'imports' and suggest policy options for slowing future growth of human appropriation of net primary production."

https://openalex.org/W2025805682,"A honey bee colony is characterized by high genetic diversity among its workers, generated by high levels of multiple mating by its queen. Few clear benefits of this genetic diversity are known. Here we show that brood nest temperatures in genetically diverse colonies (i.e., those sired by several males) tend to be more stable than in genetically uniform ones (i.e., those sired by one male). One reason this increased stability arises is because genetically determined diversity in workers' temperature response thresholds modulates the hive-ventilating behavior of individual workers, preventing excessive colony-level responses to temperature fluctuations."

https://openalex.org/W2151559423,"Regulators of apoptosis are thought to work in concert, but the molecular interactions of this process are not understood. Here, we show that in response to cell death stimulation, survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) gene family, associates with another IAP protein, XIAP, via conserved baculovirus IAP repeats. Formation of a survivin-XIAP complex promotes increased XIAP stability against ubiquitination/proteasomal destruction and synergistic inhibition of apoptosis, which is abolished in XIAP–/– cells. Therefore, orchestration of an IAP-IAP complex regulates apoptosis. Regulators of apoptosis are thought to work in concert, but the molecular interactions of this process are not understood.

Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Survivin is a structurally unique IAP protein that has been implicated in protection from apoptosis and regulation of mitosis (6Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). A role of survivin in cell division has been linked to assembly/stability of metaphase and anaphase microtubules (7Giodini A. Kallio M. Wall N.R. Gorbsky G.J. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Symons M. Altieri D.C. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2462-2467PubMed Google Scholar) and spindle checkpoint function (8Lens S.M. Medema R.H. Cell Cycle. 2003; 2: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In contrast, despite its ability to counteract apoptosis in vitro, and in transgenic animals (6Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) by which survivin inhibits apoptosis has remained elusive. This is important because IAPs, especially XIAP (9Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G. Apoptosis. 2001; 6: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and survivin (6Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), have emerged as critical regulators of cell survival in tumors and promising targets for rational anti-cancer therapy (10O'Connor D.S.

We found that in response to cell death stimulation, survivin physically associates with XIAP, and this complex promotes enhanced XIAP stability and synergistic inhibition of caspase-9 activation. Cell Culture—Breast carcinoma MCF-7, lymphoblastoid Raji, and kidney embryonic HEK293T cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Wild type (WT) or XIAP–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) (12Harlin H. Reffey S.B. Duckett C.S. Lindsten T. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3604-3608Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) were the gift of Dr. C. Duckett (University of Michigan). Protein-Protein Interactions—Affinity fractionation and immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out as described (10O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 13Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc.

Full-length survivin, truncated survivin BIR-(1–87), full-length XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, or the three isolated XIAP, BIR1-(1–123), BIR2-(123–259) and BIR3-(260–336) were expressed as GST fusion proteins (14Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar). Replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding GFP (pAd-GFP) or survivin (pAd-survivin) were described (15Blanc-Brude O.P. Mesri M. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Dohi T. Altieri D.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2683-2692PubMed Google Scholar). Pull-down experiments with recombinant survivin (0.1–0.4 μg) and GST, GST-XIAP, GST-cIAP1, GST-cIAP2 (8 μg), or the individual GST-BIR1, -BIR2, or -BIR3 of XIAP (10 μg) bound to glutathione beads (100 μl) were as described (13Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Alternatively, XIAP was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Sciences), mixed with 5 μg of GST or GST-survivin, and used in pull-down experiments. Modulation of XIAP Ubiquitination—HEK293T cells were transfected with FLAG-XIAP in the presence of survivin or control vector, pulse-labeled with 0.5 mCi of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, chased with unlabeled l-methionine, and immunoprecipitated with an antibody to FLAG (Sigma). Bands were quantified by NIH Image analysis (1.62/3DV11.01/ppc). In vitro ubiquitination reactions were performed for 1 h at 30 °C using 1 μg of survivin-His6 or control ΔN-Traf3-His6 in 40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml methylated ubiquitin, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled XIAP or 35S-labeled XIAP Lys238 → Arg mutant, with or without HEK293T extracts (30 μg). HEK293T cells were transfected with His6-ubiquitin, pcDNA3-Myc-survivin, and FLAG-XIAP, lysed after 24 h, and mixed with 60 μl of cobalt-chelation resin, and bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. In some experiments, XIAP expression levels and formation of a survivin-XIAP complex were analyzed in MCF-7 cells treated with staurosporine (1–1.5 μm for 12 h) with or without a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk (20 μm), or proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (5 μm). Analysis of Caspase Activity and Cell Death—Caspase assays were performed using recombinant caspase-9, XIAP, and survivin by continuously monitoring AFC release from the fluorigenic substrate Ac-LEHD-AFC. Alternatively, recombinant procaspase-9 (4 nm) was incubated with Apaf-1 (4 nm), cytochrome c (600 nm), dATP (200 μm), procaspase-3 (4 nm), and GST-XIAP in the presence of recombinant survivin for 30 min at 30 °C, and reaction mixtures were analyzed for cleavage of Ac-DEVD-AFC. HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFP (Clontech) and various plasmids (Superfect, Quiagen) and harvested after 24 h, and GFP+ cells were scored for nuclear morphology of apoptosis by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and fluorescence microscopy. Alternatively, WT or XIAP–/– MEF were transduced with pAd-GFP or pAd-survivin, exposed to staurosporine (0.75 μm) or UVB (1500 J/m2) for 18 h, and analyzed by DAPI staining and fluorescence microscopy. Identification of a Survivin-XIAP Complex during Apoptosis—We fractionated Raji cell extracts by affinity chromatography over an antibody to survivin (14Fortugno P. Wall N.R. Giodini A. O'Connor D.S. Plescia J. Padgett K.M. Tognin S. Marchisio P.C. Altieri D.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 575-585PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed bound proteins by immunoblotting. Survivin co-eluted with the molecular chaperone complex comprising both Hsp90 and Hsp70 (Fig. 1A), in agreement with previous observations (13Fortugno P. Beltrami E. Plescia J. Fontana J. Pradhan D. Marchisio P.C. Sessa W.C. Altieri D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13791-13796Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, the survivin complex contained the IAP family protein XIAP (4Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) in the same fractions (Fig. 1A). We next immunoprecipitated endogenous survivin from MCF-7 cells with or without exposure to the apoptotic stimulus staurosporine and probed the immune complexes by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitated survivin co-associated with endogenous XIAP, and this interaction was increased by staurosporine treatment (Fig. 1B). Immune complexes precipitated with a control IgG did not contain XIAP (Fig. 1B). Interactions of survivin with homologous IAP proteins, cIAP1 and cIAP2, were also detected but not with Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax (not shown). To investigate a role of apoptotic stimulation in the formation of a survivin-XIAP complex, we overexpressed survivin in MCF-7 cells using a replication-deficient adenovirus (pAd-survivin) and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with or without staurosporine. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to staurosporine increased the association of survivin with XIAP, whereas immunoprecipitates of non-immune IgG did not contain XIAP (Fig. 1C). We next determined whether survivin and XIAP interacted directly. Recombinant survivin bound GST-XIAP in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas no interaction with GST was observed (Fig. 1D). Reciprocally, 35S-labeled in vitro translated XIAP associated with GST-survivin but not GST (Fig. 1D). We next expressed IAP family proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 (4Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar) and tested their association with survivin. Both cIAP1 and cIAP2 bound survivin directly, whereas no interaction with GST was detected (Fig. 1E). A role of homologous BIR sequences in IAP-IAP complex formation was investigated. Recombinant survivin associated with XIAP-BIR1 and XIAP-BIR3 and more weakly with XIAP-BIR2 (Fig. 1F). Reciprocally, a truncated survivin 1–87 mutant containing the single survivin BIR bound full-length XIAP (not shown). Regulation of XIAP Stability by Survivin—MCF-7 cells transduced with pAd-GFP and exposed to staurosporine exhibited a time-dependent loss of XIAP expression (Fig. 2A). In contrast, transduction of MCF-7 cells with pAd-survivin preserved XIAP expression over time in the presence of staurosporine (Fig. 2A). We then performed [35S]l-methionine pulse-chase experiments in HEK293T cells expressing XIAP together with survivin or a control vector. Co-transfection of HEK293T cells with survivin resulted in persistence of XIAP levels over a 6-h interval after chase (Fig. 2B) and prolongation of XIAP half-life from 2 h in vector-transfected cells to 5.5 h (Fig. 2C). Addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin prevented loss of XIAP expression in staurosporine-treated MCF-7 cells, whereas a caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, was ineffective (Fig. 2D). Regulation of XIAP Ubiquitination by Survivin—When mixed with ubiquitin, in vitro translated, 35S-labeled XIAP exhibited a ladder of bands typical of polyubiquitinated conjugates (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a XIAP (Lys328 → Arg) mutant lacking a critical lysine residue involved in ubiquitination of this protein exhibited minimal ubiquitin conjugation in vitro (Fig. 3A). Addition of recombinant survivin suppressed XIAP ubiquitin conjugate formation, whereas a control Traf3 protein was ineffective (Fig. 3B). Increasing concentrations of recombinant survivin inhibited the binding of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5, to GST-XIAP (Fig. 3C), suggesting that a survivin-XIAP complex may prevent substrate accessibility to the ubiquitination machinery. We then explored whether survivin interfered with XIAP ubiquitination in vivo. Polyubiquitinated XIAP conjugates were readily detectable in HEK293T cells transfected with control pcDNA3 in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3D). In contrast, expression of survivin attenuated XIAP polyubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 3D), and produced a >4-fold reduction in the relative amounts of XIAP-ubiquitin conjugates, as compared with control cells (Fig. 3E). Cytoprotective Mechanism of the Survivin-XIAP Complex—We next used purified components in vitro to test whether a survivin-XIAP complex synergistically suppressed caspase activity. Whereas survivin alone had essentially no effect on caspase-9 generation, the combination with a suboptimal concentration of XIAP (Fig. 4A, left panel) dose-dependently inhibited caspase-9 generation (Fig. 4A, right panel). Similarly, when combined with a suboptimal concentration of XIAP (Fig. 4B, left panel), survivin inhibited caspase activity in the context of a functional apoptosome in vitro (Fig. 4B, right panel). To determine whether XIAP and survivin synergistically inhibited apoptosis in vivo, we transfected HEK293T cells with survivin and XIAP alone or in combination, and stimulated apoptosis by expressing Bax or Fas, which activate mitochondrial or death receptor apoptosis, respectively. Expression of suboptimal amounts of survivin or XIAP in HEK293T cells individually did not significantly reduce apoptosis (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the combination of XIAP and survivin synergistically suppressed cell death induced by Bax (Fig. 4C, left panel), or Fas (Fig. 4C, right panel). Next, we used XIAP–/– MEF to determine whether a survivin-XIAP complex was required for cytoprotection in vivo. Transduction of WT MEF with pAd-survivin inhibited apoptosis stimulated by staurosporine or UVB (Fig. 4D). In contrast, survivin cytoprotection was completely lost in XIAP–/– MEF (Fig. 4D). In this study, we have shown that IAP family members XIAP and survivin form a heterocomplex in response to cell death stimulation in vivo. This interaction promotes cell survival by enhancing the stability of XIAP against proteasomal destruction and by synergistically antagonizing apoptosome-mediated cell death, in a pathway abolished in XIAP–/– cells. Although the formation of heterocomplexes is a hallmark of Bcl-2 proteins (2Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3349) Google Scholar), IAP-IAP interactions have not been described previously. This recognition involves survivin binding sites on all three BIRs of XIAP, albeit with different affinities, and may affect the interaction with other BIR-interacting partners, including XIAP antagonists Smac (3Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), Omi/HtrA2 (16Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), and XIAP targets (caspase-3, -7, and -9) (4Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). Formation of a survivin-XIAP complex resulted in increased stability of XIAP against polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in vitro and in vivo, potentially by excluding the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, UbcH5. Sudden changes in IAP stability influence cell viability (19Martin S.J. Cell. 2002; 109: 807-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal destruction of IAPs enhances cell death (20Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Here, a stabilized survivin-XIAP complex synergistically suppressed caspase-9 processing/activity, alone or in the context of the apoptosome, and blocked apoptosis in vivo. Although the mechanism(s) of survivin cytoprotection have long remained elusive, these data suggest a model of intermolecular cooperation in which survivin enhances the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP to suppress the upstream initiation of mitochondrial cell death (15Blanc-Brude O.P. Mesri M. Wall N.R. Plescia J. Dohi T. Altieri D.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 2683-2692PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marusawa H. Matsuzawa S. Welsh K. Zou H. Armstrong R. Tamm I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Apoptotic stimulation induces the formation of a survivin-XIAP complex in vivo, and future studies will investigate whether this reflects post-translational modifications in survivin (10O'Connor D.S. Wall N.R. Porter A.C. Altieri D.C. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) and/or XIAP (21Dan H.C. Sun M. Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Nicosia S.V.

Targeted antagonists of the IAP-IAP complex may be suitable to disable apoptosis resistance in tumors, where survivin (6Altieri D.C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar), and XIAP (9Holcik M. Gibson H. Korneluk R.G.

Antiretroviral activity of APOBEC3G requires its packaging into assembling virions, presumably to ensure its close association with nascent retroviral cDNA. Here, we demonstrate that APOBEC3G is encapsidated through a direct interaction with the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein which likely takes place on the membranes of the multivesicular bodies (MVB)/late endosomal compartments. This interaction is mediated by the Gag nucleocapsid protein NC, and the N-terminal part of NC is most critical for this interaction.

Antiretroviral activity of APOBEC3G requires its encapsidation into assembling virions, presumably to ensure its close association with the retroviral reverse transcription complex and nascent retroviral cDNA. In the absence of Vif, APOBEC3G is specifically incorporated into the assembling HIV-1 virions, reducing infectivity of the newly produced virus (7Harris R.S. Bishop K.N. Sheehy A.M. Craig H.M.

Analysis of the molecular mechanism(s) by which this antiviral protein is targeted to virus assembly sites may suggest an alternative approach to increase its virion levels in the presence of Vif. The precise cellular distribution of APOBEC3G has not yet been investigated but may provide an insight into the mechanism of its incorporation into virions. Results presented herein suggest that APOBEC3G is encapsidated through a direct interaction with the nucleocapsid of HIV-1 Gag. Moreover, we suggest that binding of APOBEC3G to abundantly produced Gag during infection may lead not only to its encapsidation but also result in degradation of APOBEC3G complexed with Gag. Both mechanisms may significantly deplete APOBEC3G levels independently of Vif. Reagents—Recombinant APOBEC3G and anti-APOBEC3G monoclonal antibodies were from ImmunoDiagnostics. Mouse anti-GFP 3E6, rabbit anti-GFP, LysoTracker Red, and transferrin Alexa Fluor 594 were from Molecular Probes. Mouse anti-α-tubulin, anti-CD63/LAMP-3, anti-Rab7 antibodies, and protein A/G plus-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-HA, mouse monoclonal 12CA5 and rat monoclonal 3F10 antibodies were from Roche Applied Science. Mouse anti-CD71 was from Beckman Coulter. Mouse anti-His and anti-EEA1 antibodies were from Invitrogen and BD Transduction Laboratories, respectively. Virion Encapsidation Assay—4 or 10 ml of culture supernatant from transfected 293T cells were filtered through 0.45-μm filters and concentrated by ultracentrifugation in a SW 60 or SW 41 rotor (Beckman) at 25,000 rpm for 2 h through a layer of 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline. The pelleted virus-like particles were solubilized in 50–100 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Applied Science), and 40 μl was analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—Western blot analysis was performed as described (24Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, postnuclear cell lysates in RIPA buffer were prepared from transfected 293T cells. Cell lysates (0.5–1 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-GFP 3E6 monoclonal antibody and protein A/G plus-agarose. After extensive washing, the precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. In Vitro Binding Experiments—HIV-1 Gag and various Gag mutants (constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli and were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads (25Burniston M.T. Cimarelli A. Colgan J. Curtis S.P. Luban J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8527-8540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of the GST and GST-Gag fusion proteins was monitored by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue. The glutathione-Sepharose beads with associated GST (negative control) or GST-Gag proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with recombinant APOBEC3G or with cell lysates prepared from transfected 293T cells expressing APOBEC3G tagged with GFP, His, or HA. After washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS Laemmli buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy—293T cells were grown on glass chamber slides (Nalgene Nunc International) and transfected with GFP-APOBEC3G and Gag or Gag-GFP expression vectors, and 24 h later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and analyzed by confocal microscopy (24Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For labeling of the early or late endosomes, the transfected cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with transferrin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 or with LysoTracker Red, respectively (Molecular Probes), according to the manufacturer's protocols. The images were taken with a LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Zeiss). Biochemical Analysis of APOBEC3G Binding to Cellular Membranes and Lipid Rafts—Transfected 293T cells were harvested in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. The postnuclear supernatant was separated into total membrane and cytosolic fractions by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 30 min (26Sciorra V.A. Rudge S.A. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. EMBO J. 1999; 20: 5911-5921Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Endosomal membranes were prepared from transfected cells by centrifugation of the postnuclear supernatant on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (27Sun W. Yan Q. Vida T.A. Bean A.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts were prepared using 0.5% Triton X-100 as described in detail (24Popik W. Alce T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 704-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Popik W. Alce T.M. Au W.-C. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4709-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Transfection of GFP-APOBEC3G with increasing amounts of HIV-1 Gag reduced intracellular GFP-APOBEC3G steady-state levels in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Since Gag itself is sufficient to drive the assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs), we reasoned that reduction of GFP-APOBEC3G expression in cells resulted from APOBEC3G packaging into VLPs, most likely through the interaction with Gag. To test this hypothesis, 293T cells were transfected, and 24 h later culture supernatants were collected, filtered, and ultracentrifuged to pellet VLPs. Cell lysates were prepared from the same transfected cells, and both VLPs and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of Gag and GFP-APOBEC3G (Fig. 1B). The results show that decreasing steady-state levels of GFP-APOBEC3G in cell lysates correlated with the increasing amount of transfected Gag expression vector. This increased amount of Gag resulted in greater accumulation of APOBEC3G in VLPs. Moreover, in the presence of Gag, GFP-APOBEC3G redistributed into a discrete punctate pattern localized close to, or at, the cell surface (Fig. 2A) and most likely represents coaggregating Gag and APOBEC3G (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that APOBEC3G interacts with Gag in the absence of other viral proteins. This possibility was further substantiated by the observation that Gag and APOBEC3G were bound to cell membranes pelleted from postnuclear supernatants prepared from transfected 293T cells in the absence of detergent (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, APOBEC3G localized to Triton X-100-resistant lipid rafts (Fig. 2D), which probably are not of plasma membrane origin, since APOBEC3G did not noticeably localize to the plasma membrane (data not shown). Thus, we hypothesize that APOBEC3G associates with intracellular membrane rafts. Since Gag concentrates both in the plasma membrane and multivesicular bodies (MVB)/late endosomal compartments (29Pelchen-Matthews A. Kramer B. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 30Nydegger S. Foti M. Derdowski A. Spearman P. Thali M. Traffic. 2003; 4: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 31Ono A. Freed E.O. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 1552-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) enriched in lipid rafts and both Gag and APOBEC3G colocalize (Fig. 2B), we speculate that APOBEC3G may interact with Gag at the membranes of the MVB/late endosomal compartments. Indeed, APOBEC3G partially cofractionated with the late endosomal/lysosomal markers, Rab7 and CD63/LAMP-3 (Fig. 3A). Solubilization of APOBEC3G as well as Rab7 and CD63 with the mild nonionic detergent octyl glucoside shows that these proteins were indeed associated with membrane fractions. Coexpression of Gag-GFP and APOBEC3G-HA in 293T cells resulted in significant accumulation of APOBEC3G in Rab7-positive and EEA1-negative late endosomes (Fig. 3B), suggesting that accumulation of Gag on MVB/late endosomes may be responsible for bringing more APOBEC3G to this compartment. These results were confirmed by confocal analysis using fluorescent LysoTracker Red, a specific probe for labeling late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 3C). While Gag-GFP and GFP-APOBEC3G colocalized with the LysoTracker-labeled compartment, significantly less colocalization was observed between APOBEC3G and the early endosomal marker transferrin-Alexa Fluor 594, suggesting that APOBEC3G was not randomly associated with intracellular membranes but specifically targeted to late endosomal vesicles. Together, these data strongly support the idea that APOBEC3G and Gag interact on intracellular membranes, most likely in the late endosomal compartment.Fig. 2Subcellular colocalization of APOBEC3G and Gag.A and B, immunofluorescence images showing that in the presence of Gag, GFP-APOBEC3G distributes into a discrete punctate pattern (A) representing colocalization of GFP-APOBEC3G with Gag-DsRed (merge, in B). C, Gag and GFP-APOBEC3G bind to cell membranes pelleted from postnuclear supernatant prepared from transfected 293T cells. Western blot analysis shows that Gag and APOBEC3G distribute to cytosolic and particulate fractions (C and P, respectively). D, APOBEC3G localizes to lipid rafts independently of Gag. Postnuclear lysates in 0.5% Triton X-100 were prepared from transfected 293T cells and fractionated on sucrose density gradients. Individual fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies to detect APOBEC3G and Gag, respectively. Localization of raft-resident ganglioside GM1 and non-raft marker CD71 is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Distribution of GFP-APOBEC3G and endosomal markers.A, APOBEC3G cofractionates with late endosomal membrane markers. Transfected 293T cells were disrupted in homogenization buffer (HB; 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. The postnuclear supernatants were divided into two parts; one part was left untreated while the other was incubated with 0.5% nonionic detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (octyl glucoside). Lysates were subsequently adjusted to 41% sucrose and overlaid with 35 and 25% sucrose and homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected from the top of the gradient and were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of APOBEC3G and endosomal markers, Rab7 and CD63/LAMP-3. B, GFP-APOBEC3G and Gag-GFP colocalize with Rab7-positive and EEA1-negative late endosomes. Cells were cotransfected with Gag-GFP and APOBEC3G-HA plasmids and postnuclear supernatants (PNS) were prepared and fractionated as described in (A). Following centrifugation, all three interfaces were collected and designated as the heavy membrane fraction (HM, 41%/35% interface), early endosomes (EE, 35%/25%), and late endosomes (LE, 25%/HB) as described (33Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of each fraction, including postnuclear supernatants, were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of APOBEC3G, Gag, Rab7 (late endosome marker), and EEA1 (early endosome marker). C, colocalization of GFP-APOBEC3G and Gag-GFP with late endosomal/lysosomal marker LysoTracker Red. Transfected cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with red fluorescent LysoTracker, a specific probe for labeling of late endosomes and lysosomes or with the early endosomal marker transferrin-Alexa Fluor 594 and processed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Merged images of GFP-APOBEC3G or Gag-GFP with LysoTracker Red or transferrin-Alexa Fluor 594 are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To test the potential interaction between Gag and APOBEC3G, in vitro binding assays were performed with recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli. HIV-1 Gag was expressed as a GST-Gag fusion protein, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 4A, Coomassie Stain), and washed and assayed for the ability to bind recombinant APOBEC3G or His-APOBEC3G prepared from lysates of transiently transfected 293T cells (Fig. 4A, upper panels). Results show that APOBEC3G associated with GST-Gag but not with GST, indicating that the interaction was specific for Gag. Furthermore, to identify the Gag domain that interacts with APOBEC3G, different Gag deletion mutants expressing MA, MA-CA-p2, or MA-CA-p2-p1-p6 (Gag ΔNC) were produced as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4A, Coomassie Stain) and assayed for the ability to bind APOBEC3G. The results demonstrate that in the absence of the NC domain there is no binding to APOBEC3G. Thus, the Gag NC domain is likely to mediate the interaction with APOBEC3G. Since the purity of recombinant APOBEC3G and GST-Gag was greater than 95%, it seems unlikely that any contaminating proteins act as cofactors for the association between Gag and APOBEC3G in this assay. To confirm that the interaction between Gag and APOBEC3G occurs in vivo, a coimmunoprecipitation experiment was performed (Fig. 4B). 293T cells were transfected with expression vectors for Gag-GFP or Gag-GFP deletion mutants and/or APOBEC3G-HA, and 24 h later, the cellular lysates were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of Gag and APOBEC3G using specific anti-tag antibodies. Results of the experiment show that APOBEC3G was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies only when coexpressed with Gag-GFP and in the presence of Gag NC domain (Fig. 4B). Thus coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the requirement of Gag NC domain seen in GST pulldown assay. The significance of the NC domain in the interaction with APOBEC3G was further confirmed by showing that the NC domain fused with GST was sufficient to interact in vitro with APOBEC3G (Fig. 5A). However, in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, binding of APOBEC3G to the NC-GFP domain was not as strong as in in vitro binding experiments. This may be due to the steric hindrance imposed by anti-GFP antibodies binding in close proximity to NC in the APOBEC3G-NC complex. Interestingly, when this paper was submitted, Cen et al. (32Cen S. Guo F. Niu M. Saadatmand J. Deflassieux J. Kleiman L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 33177-33184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) showed that HIV-1 Gag alone is sufficient for packaging of APOBEC3G into Gag VLPs, and this incorporation requires the presence of Gag nucleocapsid. Thus, these findings corroborate our results. HIV-1 Gag NC is rich in basic residues and contains two zinc fingers. To determine more precisely which region of NC is responsible for the observed interaction with APOBEC3G, deletion mutants were produced as GST fusion proteins. The amino acid residues deleted were 1–28 in NC ΔZn1 and 29–55 in NC ΔZn2. Both in vitro GST fusion pulldown experiments (Fig. 5A) and immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 5B) show conclusively that although the N-terminal domain of NC (amino acid residues 1–28) is critical for the interaction with APOBEC3G, the C-terminal NC domain (amino acids 29–55) also contributes partially to the binding with APOBEC3G. Together, our results demonstrate that the antiretroviral protein APOBEC3G is incorporated into viral particles by direct binding to the NC domain of the Gag precursor p55 polyprotein. We hypothesize that the interaction with the NC domain ensures that APOBEC3G will be confined to the condensed HIV-1 core formed during virus maturation and containing HIV-1 RNA and reverse transcriptase and thus will have access to the reverse transcription products produced after virus entry. Our results also raise the possibility that abundant production of Gag proteins observed during infection (from which only a fraction will be incorporated into progeny virions, the rest most likely being degraded) may actually work as a decoy for APOBEC3G and deplete the cellular enzyme to levels insufficient for effective encapsidation and subsequent HIV-1 DNA editing activity. Another important implication of these results is that inhibition of the interaction between APOBEC3G and Vif by drugs (which may prevent APOBEC3G degradation) may not be sufficient to prevent depletion of APOBEC3G by HIV-1 Gag.Fig. 5Contribution of HIV-1 Gag NC subdomains to the interaction with APOBEC3G.A, Gag NC mutants containing either the N terminus of NC (mutant ΔZn2: amino acids 1–28) or C terminus of NC (mutant ΔZn1: amino acids 29–55) as well as the NC domain were produced and purified as GST fusion proteins (lower panel, Coomassie Stain) and assayed for the ability to bind GFP-APOBEC3G expressed in transfected 293T cells. Bound GFP-APOBEC3G was visualized by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies (upper panel, GFP-APO). B, cell lysates and VLPs prepared from transfected 293Tcells were analyzed for the presence of Gag-GFP mutants and APOBEC3G by Western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation of Gag-GFP NC deletion mutants and Gag NC-GFP with APOBEC3G-HA expressed in 293T cells was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Note that since Gag-NC-GFP present in lysate and anti-GFP immunoprecipitates is much smaller than the other Gag-GFP mutant proteins (see Fig. 5A for comparison), it is not shown according to its molecular weight.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We thank A.

Vaccinia virus is a poxvirus that was used over 20 years ago to eradicate variola virus infection (smallpox) (1Moss B. Howley P.M. Knipe D.M. Fields Virology.

Vaccinia virus encodes the A46R and A52R proteins, which have been shown to act as dominant negative inhibitors of TIR signaling. A46R has been shown to inhibit IL-1 signaling, whereas A52R interferes with IL-1, IL-18, and TLR signaling, thereby inhibiting both the innate and ultimately the adaptive immune response (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Signals initiated by several pro-inflammatory cytokines, or by Toll receptor engagement, lead to TIR clustering that recruits one or more TIR adapter proteins: Mal/TIRAP, TRIF/TICAM-1, MyD88, and TRAM/TIRP/TICAM-2 (5Bin L.

Recruitment of these TIR domain-containing adapter proteins leads to the recruitment of IRAK family members, which subsequently activate TRAF6 (13Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Activated TRAF6 is thought to autoubiquitinate and then bind and activate a transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1-containing complex. Transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 then likely phosphorylates and activates the I-κB kinase (IKK) complex (14Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G. Inoue J. Chen Z. Wang C. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The IKK complex is composed of two structurally similar kinases, IKK-α and IKK-β, as well as the noncatalytic regulatory subunit IKK-γ (also called NEMO). The activated IKK complex phosphorylates I-κBα on serines 32 and 36 leading to its polyubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. Degradation of I-κB permits nuclear translocation of NF-κB, ultimately driving transcription of NF-κB-responsive genes (reviewed in Refs. 15Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4103) Google Scholar and 16Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Current data indicate that the IKK complex is critical for IκB degradation and NF-κB activation in response to pro-inflammatory signals. Vaccinia virus was known to encode two proteins that inhibit the components of the Toll and IL-1 signaling pathways (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Other poxviruses encode several uncharacterized homologs of these Toll/IL-1R signaling inhibitors (17Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Osorio F.A. Balinsky C. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We conducted data base searches that detected a significant similarity among previously identified poxvirus inhibitors of Toll/IL-1R signaling (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) and the N1L protein of vaccinia virus. N1L is among the strongest determinants of vaccinia virus virulence (18Kotwal G. Hugin A. Moss B. Virology. 1989; 171: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Bartlett N. Symons J. Tscharke D. Smith G. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas N1L has modest effects on adaptive immunity, N1L suppresses initial host defenses against vaccinia virus challenge by a factor of 104 (18Kotwal G. Hugin A. Moss B. Virology. 1989; 171: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that N1L inhibits innate immunity. However, the mechanism whereby the N1L virulence factor functions was previously unknown (18Kotwal G. Hugin A. Moss B. Virology. 1989; 171: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 19Bartlett N. Symons J. Tscharke D. Smith G. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here it is shown that signaling via TNF-α, lymphotoxins, and Toll/IL-1R family members are fundamental immune response pathways inhibited by N1L. Signaling by inflammatory cytokines, TIR adapter molecules, and several downstream components of the NF-κB signaling pathway is inhibited by N1L. N1L co-immunoprecipitates along with members of the IKK complex. N1L also inhibited the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) in response to double-stranded RNA stimulation of TLR3 or transfection of a TIR adapter that mediates signaling to IRF3. Taken together, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that N1L disrupts the IRF3/NF-κB signaling pathways by targeting the IKK kinase complex, thereby establishing the role of N1L as a viral immunomodulator of innate immunity. Cell Culture and Cell Lines—Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HEK 293 cell-stable transfectants were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of 400 μg/ml Geneticin sulfate, 10% heat-inactivated bovine calf serum, 600 μg/ml l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 20 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. Wild type HEK cells were maintained in the identical medium without Geneticin. The HEK cells stably expressing CD14, MD2, and either TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4 have been described previously (6Fitzgerald K. McWhirter S. Faia K. Rowe D. Latz E. Golenbock D. Coyle A. Liao S. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar, 20Kurt-Jones E. Mandell L. Whitney C.

For use in transfection assays, HEK 293 cells were typically seeded at 2 × 104 cells per milliliter in 96-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. Vector Construction and Plasmids—An N1L construct was created by PCR amplification of the N1L open reading frame of vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain) DNA donated by Francis Ennis and Masanori Terajima (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). To create N1L-encoding vectors, N1L was amplified using the primers: 5′-ATGAGGACTCTACTTATTAGA-3′ and 5′-TTATTTTTCACCATATAGATC-3′. The PCR product was TA-cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, pCR3.1N1L, was sequenced in both directions using bGH reverse and T7 forward primers. N1L cDNA was subcloned into the pDNR-dual vector, which encodes a C-terminal 6× histidine-arginine (HN) tag (BD Biosciences). pDNRN1L-6×HN underwent recombination with a hemagglutinin (HA)-acceptor vector yielding an HA-N1L-HN-tagged version of N1L. The resulting construct was also sequenced. pcDNA3.1N1L was constructed by ligating BamHI-NotI-digested pCR3.1N1L into pcDNA3.1(+) that had been identically digested. FLAG-tagged Mal, TRIF, IKKϵ, TBK1, and the pGL3–5XκB-luc plasmid were previously described (6Fitzgerald K. McWhirter S. Faia K. Rowe D. Latz E. Golenbock D. Coyle A. Liao S. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2096) Google Scholar). The ISG54 ISRE luciferase vector was purchased from Stratagene. (FLAG-tagged TRAM was also previously described (6Fitzgerald K.

N-terminally FLAG-tagged IKK-α (22Regnier C. Song H. Gao X. Goeddel D. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), a C-terminally FLAG-tagged modification of IKK-β (23Woronicz J. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), FLAG-TRAF6, and FLAG-TRAF2 (24Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V. Goeddel D. Science. 1995; 269: 1424-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) were gifts of D. Goeddel (Tularik, Inc., San Francisco, CA). The plasmid encoding BZLF1 was a gift of Joan Mannick (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The plasmid thymidine kinase Renilla luciferase (pTk-Renilla) was purchased from Promega Inc. (Madison, WI). The plasmid encoding MyD88 was from M. Muzio (Mario Negri Institute, Milan, Italy). Chimeric TLR receptors CD4-TLR1, CD4-TLR2, CD4-TLR4, and CD4-TLR6, composed of the extracellular domain of CD4 fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of the TLR, were gifts from R. Medzhitov (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Reagents—Poly(dI·dC) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The Mycoplasma fermentans-derived membrane macrophage-activating lipopeptide of 2 kDa was generated as previously described (25Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) and was obtained both from P. F. Mühlradt (Gesellschaft für Biotechnologische Forschung, Braunschweig, Germany) and from G. Rawadi (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Escherichia coli strain 011:B4 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and either used directly or purified as described before (26Takeuchi O. Kaufmann A. Kawai T. Hoshino K. Morr M. Mühlradt P. Shizuo A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Human IL-1-β and TNF-α were purchased from Cell Sciences (Woburn, MA). Transient Transfection and NF-κB or IRF3 Reporter Assays—HEK 293 cells were transfected with vectors encoding components of either the TIR or the lymphotoxin signal transduction pathways. HEK cells were co-transfected with ISRE luciferase vector or NF-κB luciferase vector, Tk-Renilla luciferase vector, N1L or empty vector, and in certain cases with a component of the NF-κB signaling pathway. All HEK 293 cell transfections were performed using GeneJuice (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfection efficiency was normalized by transfection of cells with a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase. The amount of DNA transfected was equalized among experiments by the addition of various amounts of the appropriate empty vector plasmid. To assay firefly and Renilla luciferase activity, cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was determined by standard protocols, using methods as described (7Fitzgerald K. Palsson-McDermott E. Bowie A. Jefferies C. Mansell A. Brady G. Brint E. Dunne A. Gray P. Harte M. McMurray D. Smith D. Sims J. Bird T. O'Neill L. Nature. 2001; 413: 78Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Results are presented as mean ± S.E. and are consistent with the results of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analyses were via an unpaired, two-tailed t test performed using GraphPad Prism software. Co-immunoprecipitation—HEK cells were co-transfected with HA/HN-tagged N1L and a FLAG-tagged component of the NF-κB signal transduction system, as indicated in the figure legends. For each transfection, a confluent T25 flask of HEK 293 cells was trypsinized and washed. Cells were then lysed on ice for 1 hour in 100 μl of a lysis buffer comprising 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, and Complete™ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 × g, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HN antibody (BD Biosciences) bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated proteins were boiled in Laemmli buffer for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Transfer to a 0.45-μm PVDF membrane was followed by blocking, and then the blot was probed with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) and later probed with a donkey anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min essentially as described (27Harte M. Haga I. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P. Bartlett N. Smith G. Bowie A. O'Neill L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 97: 343-351Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In certain experiments the primary antibody step was followed by incubation with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody that recognizes native rabbit IgG (TrueBlot™, eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Between the blocking and antibody incubation steps the PVDF membrane was washed repeatedly with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween 20. Resulting bands on the immunoblot were developed with the ECL developer system (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized on a Fuji Imager. Immunoprecipitation with anti-HN-coated Protein A-Sepharose beads followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibody was used to confirm the specificity of the results. In other experiments, anti-HN antibodies (Clontech) were used to co-immunoprecipitate HA-TANK and HA-IKKγ alongside HA-N1L-HN. Subsequently, an immunoblot with anti-HA antibody (Clontech) was performed as above. Finally, anti-IKKγ antibody (Cell Sciences) was used to immunoblot lysates from the indicated transfectants that were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Presence of IKKγ in lysates was also confirmed. In Vitro Transcription and Translation and Protein-Protein Interaction—In vitro transcription and translation were performed essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions as outlined in the TnT Quick kit from Promega (Madison, WI) using 0.5 μg of the indicated DNA template, a biotinylated lysine label (Pathdetect, Promega). After confirmation of protein expression with an aliquot of protein, aliquots of N1L and various IKK components were incubated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, 8.2% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA and Complete™ protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with Protein G-Sepharose-coupled anti-FLAG antibody, or HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with Protein A-Sepharose-coupled anti-HA antibody and then washed four times in hypotonic lysis buffer (see above). Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto PVDF membranes, which were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 and subsequently incubated with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase. Labeled proteins on the blot were detected by chemiluminescence (Promega), and images were captured on a Fuji Imager. The N1L Proteins from Vaccinia and Other Poxviruses Have Sequence Similarity to Inhibitors of NF-κB Signaling—The amino acid sequence of N1L is relatively conserved from sheep-pox virus to vaccinia, and N1L amino acid sequence is almost identical among most vaccinia viruses (19Bartlett N. Symons J. Tscharke D. Smith G. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus encodes two known inhibitors of IL-1 and TLR signaling that are similar in sequence (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), albeit functionally distinct inhibitors of NF-κB signaling (27Harte M. Haga I. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P. Bartlett N. Smith G. Bowie A. O'Neill L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 97: 343-351Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Several poxvirus proteins have been noted as potential inhibitors of NF-κB signaling based upon their sequence similarity (17Afonso C.L. Tulman E.R. Lu Z. Zsak L. Osorio F.A. Balinsky C. Kutish G.F. Rock D.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Bowie A. Zhan J. Marshall W. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 91: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to known poxvirus inhibitors of NF-κB stimulation (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 27Harte M. Haga I. Maloney G. Gray P. Reading P. Bartlett N. Smith G. Bowie A. O'Neill L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 97: 343-351Crossref Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our data base searches demonstrate that N1L is very similar (PHI-BLAST e = 3 × 10–12) to A52R, which has been shown to inhibit Toll, IL-1β, and IL-18 signaling to NF-κB (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because of this sequence similarity, we hypothesized that N1L inhibited signaling to NF-κB. N1L Inhibits Signaling to NF-κB by IL-1β, TNF-α, and Lymphotoxins—Because N1L has sequence similarity to poxvirus inhibitors of signaling by IL-1 and TLRs (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we first tested the hypothesis that N1L inhibits IL-1 function. Stimulation of NF-κB activity by IL-1β was significantly suppressed by N1L (Fig. 1A, p = 0.0084). N1L also inhibited stimulation of NF-κB by TNF-α signaling (Fig. 1A, p = 0.015). Next, the effect of N1L on stimulation by the lymphotoxin family member, LIGHT (29Tamada K. Shimozaki K. Chapoval A. Zhai Y. Su J. Chen S. Hsieh S. Nagata S. Ni J. Chen L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), was examined. In a simultaneous experiment (Fig. 1A), N1L inhibited LIGHT-mediated NF-κB signaling 5-fold compared with vector-transfected cells, which was significant (p = 0.02). The finding that N1L also inhibited signaling by TNF-α and LIGHT (Fig. 1A), whereas A52R does not block TNF-α (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), indicated that N1L was a functionally distinct vaccinia virus inhibitor of signaling to NF-κB. To determine the specificity of the inhibition of NF-κB activity by N1L, the activity of N1L on reporter constructs other than NF-κB was tested. N1L was transfected with one of three reporter constructs: NF-κB luciferase, AP-1 luciferase, or NFAT luciferase. Reporter constructs were co-transfected with the Epstein-Barr virus transactivator BZLF1, which both binds to and stimulates transcription from AP-1 sites (30Farrell P. Rowe D. Rooney C. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) while inhibiting NF-κB activity in lymphocytes (31Dreyfus D. Nagasawa M. Pratt J. Kelleher C. Gelfand E. J. Immnol. 1999; 163: 6261-6268PubMed Google Scholar). Despite 2-fold inhibition of basal NF-κB activity, N1L did not inhibit AP-1 luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). BZLF1 suppressed NF-κB activity, consistent with results in lymphocytes (31Dreyfus D. Nagasawa M. Pratt J. Kelleher C. Gelfand E. J. Immnol. 1999; 163: 6261-6268PubMed Google Scholar). NFAT luciferase activity was not observed. Thus, the inhibitory effect of N1L is specific to the NF-κB and not the AP-1 pathway. In separate experiments, no cytotoxicity was evident in N1L-transfected cells based upon Annexin V staining or flow cytometric analysis (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that N1L specifically down-modulates signaling by NF-κB that occurs in response to several inflammatory cytokines. N1L Inhibits Signaling to NF-κB by Toll Receptors TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4 —The hypothesis that N1L inhibits Toll receptor signaling was considered for several reasons. First, N1L possesses sequence similarity to vaccinia virus inhibitors of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling (2Bowie A. Kiss-Toth E. Symons J. Smith G. Dower S. La O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10162-10167Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Second, N1L inhibits IL-1β signaling (Fig. 1A), suggesting that N1L may interact with a component of the Toll/IL-1 signaling pathway. Finally, whereas N1L does not appreciably inhibit adaptive immunity, such as antibody response and cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, N1L significantly increases the ability of vaccinia virus to overcome host defenses to initial viral challenge (18Kotwal G. Hugin A. Moss B. Virology. 1989; 171: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that N1L inhibits innate immunity. Therefore, we hypothesized that N1L is involved in inhibition of the Toll receptors that mediate an antiviral innate immune response. To test whether N1L inhibited NF-κB activation by TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4, we used two different approaches: a ligand-dependent system utilizing stable transfection of HEK 293 cells and a transient, constitutively active TLR expression system. HEK 293 cells stably expressing either TLR2, TLR3, or TLR4 were treated with their respective ligands: lipopeptide, the dsRNA mimetic, poly(dI·dC), or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (8Akira S. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2000; 6: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 32Takeuchi O. Akira S. Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 887-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 33Means T. Golenbock D. Fenton M. Life Sci. 2000; 68: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and analyzed as in Fig. 1. Chimeric versions of the TLRs, comprising the murine CD4 extracellular domain fused to the cytoplasmic domain of a given human TLR, have proved useful in probing TLR signaling pathways (34Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway C.J. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4453) Google Scholar). Some TLR cytoplasmic domains can induce gene expression as homodimers (TLR4 and TLR5), whereas others signal as heterodimers (TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6) (35Ozinsky A. Underhill D. Fontenot J. Hajjar A. Smith K. Wilson C. Schroeder L. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13766-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of CD4 renders the TLR chimera constructs constitutively active. Using these chimeras, TLR signaling can be examined in the absence of an exogenous activator. Signaling by TLR2 was first analyzed in stable HEK 293 transfectants. N1L inhibits TLR2-dependent signaling in response to lipopeptide agonists (Fig. 2A, top panel, p = 0.0014 for unpurified LPS, p = 0.044 for membrane macrophageactivating lipopeptide of 2 kDa). Use of transient co-transfection of N1L and constitutively active chimeric CD4-TLR1, CD4-TLR2, CD4-TLR4, and CD4-TLR 6 demonstrates N1L-mediated inhibition of TLR2 signaling in conjunction with TLR1 (Fig. 2A, middle panel, p = 0.0246) or TLR6 (Fig. 2A, bottom panel, p = 0.0017). TLR3, which is known to interact with viral dsRNA, was analyzed next. The TLR3 ligand poly(dI·dC) was used to stimulate stable TLR3 transfectants. 12-fold inhibition by N1L of HEK 293 cells stably expressing TLR3 was observed (Fig. 2B, top panel, p = 0.0004). N1L inhibits signaling induced by poly(dI·dC) treatment of HEK cells transiently transfected with TLR3 (p = 0.0174) (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). TLR4 function was next examined and is inhibited by N1L (Fig. 2C, top panel, p = 0.011). CD4-TLR4 signaling is inhibited by N1L (p = 0.0146) (Fig."

https://openalex.org/W2032660967,"Efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) budding requires an interaction between the PTAP late domain in the viral p6Gag protein and the cellular protein TSG101. In yeast, Vps23p/TSG101 binds both Vps28p and Vps37p to form the soluble ESCRT-I complex, which functions in sorting ubiquitylated protein cargoes into multivesicular bodies. Human cells also contain ESCRT-I, but the VPS37 component(s) have not been identified. Bioinformatics and yeast two-hybrid screening methods were therefore used to identify four novel human proteins (VPS37A–D) that share weak but significant sequence similarity with yeast Vps37p and to demonstrate that VPS37A and VPS37B bind TSG101. Detailed studies produced four lines of evidence that human VPS37B is a Vps37p ortholog. 1) TSG101 bound to several different sites on VPS37B, including a putative coiled-coil region and a PTAP motif. 2) TSG101 and VPS28 co-immunoprecipitated with VPS37B-FLAG, and the three proteins comigrated together in soluble complexes of the correct size for human ESCRT-I (∼350 kDa). 3) Like TGS101, VPS37B became trapped on aberrant endosomal compartments in the presence of VPS4A proteins lacking ATPase activity. 4) Finally, VPS37B could recruit TSG101/ESCRT-I activity and thereby rescue the budding of both mutant Gag particles and HIV-1 viruses lacking native late domains. Further studies of ESCRT-I revealed that TSG101 mutations that inhibited PTAP or VPS28 binding blocked HIV-1 budding. Taken together, these experiments define new components of the human ESCRT-I complex and characterize several TSG101 protein/protein interactions required for HIV-1 budding and infectivity. Efficient human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) budding requires an interaction between the PTAP late domain in the viral p6Gag protein and the cellular protein TSG101. In yeast, Vps23p/TSG101 binds both Vps28p and Vps37p to form the soluble ESCRT-I complex, which functions in sorting ubiquitylated protein cargoes into multivesicular bodies. Human cells also contain ESCRT-I, but the VPS37 component(s) have not been identified. Bioinformatics and yeast two-hybrid screening methods were therefore used to identify four novel human proteins (VPS37A–D) that share weak but significant sequence similarity with yeast Vps37p and to demonstrate that VPS37A and VPS37B bind TSG101. Detailed studies produced four lines of evidence that human VPS37B is a Vps37p ortholog. 1) TSG101 bound to several different sites on VPS37B, including a putative coiled-coil region and a PTAP motif. 2) TSG101 and VPS28 co-immunoprecipitated with VPS37B-FLAG, and the three proteins comigrated together in soluble complexes of the correct size for human ESCRT-I (∼350 kDa). 3) Like TGS101, VPS37B became trapped on aberrant endosomal compartments in the presence of VPS4A proteins lacking ATPase activity. 4) Finally, VPS37B could recruit TSG101/ESCRT-I activity and thereby rescue the budding of both mutant Gag particles and HIV-1 viruses lacking native late domains. Further studies of ESCRT-I revealed that TSG101 mutations that inhibited PTAP or VPS28 binding blocked HIV-1 budding. Taken together, these experiments define new components of the human ESCRT-I complex and characterize several TSG101 protein/protein interactions required for HIV-1 budding and infectivity. Viral Budding 101Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 279Issue 34PreviewIn order to bud from host cells and spread infection, HIV-1 hijacks a pathway that normally sorts ubiquitylated proteins into multivesicular bodies. The HIV Gag protein contains a Pro-Thr-Ala-Pro (PTAP) motif, which recruits the human tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101) to link the virus to protein sorting and vesicle formation machinery. In yeast, the TSG101 ortholog Vps23p binds to Vps28p and Vps37p to form ESCRT-I (Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport). Although a similar ESCRT-I pathway is found in humans, the understanding of this pathway has been hampered by the lack of an identifiable VPS37 ortholog.

HIV budding requires both cis-acting viral elements and trans-acting cellular proteins (reviewed in Ref. 1Morita E. Sundquist W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient release and replication of HIV-1 in most cell types, including primary cells, require a conserved cis-acting P(S/T)AP motif (the “late domain”), located in the C-terminal p6 region of the structural Gag protein (2Göttlinger H.G.

The P(S/T)AP late domain binds and recruits the cellular protein TSG101 (tumor susceptibility gene 101), which facilitates efficient separation of the viral and cellular membranes during the final stages of virus release (6Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W.

In addition to HIV-1, several other pathogenic human viruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type I (Retroviridae), Ebola virus (Filoviridae) and Lassa virus (Arenaviridae), also use P(S/T)AP late domains to recruit TSG101 during virus budding (7Martin-Serrano J.

In turn, TSG101 helps to recruit a complex set of cellular machinery that is normally used for protein sorting, membrane distortion, and fission at the multivesicular body (MVB) (1Morita E. Sundquist W.I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Much of our understanding of MVB biogenesis comes from studies in yeast (reviewed in Refs. 14Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar and 15Raiborg C. Rusten T.E. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Vps23p, the yeast ortholog of TSG101, binds two other proteins, Vps28p and Vps37p, to form a stable soluble ∼350-kDa complex called ESCRT-I (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) (16Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). ESCRT-I is recruited to the endosomal membrane through an interaction with the upstream Vps27p-HRS complex (17Lu Q. Hope L.W. Brasch M. Reinhard C. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7626-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 18Bache K.G. Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Once on the membrane, ESCRT-I helps recruit a series of downstream proteins and complexes (the “Class E” proteins), which collectively sort ubiquitylated proteins into vesicles that bud into the maturing endosome to create MVBs. In most cases, these protein sorting and vesiculation events ultimately target proteins for degradation in the interior of the lysosome (vacuole in yeast). Although the human MVB pathway is more complex and less well characterized than the yeast pathway, there is now good evidence for conservation of ESCRT-I composition and function from yeast to humans. First, TSG101 and VPS28 are required for the ubiquitin-dependent delivery of cathepsin D and endocytosed receptors to the lysosome (e.g. Refs. 17Lu Q. Hope L.W. Brasch M. Reinhard C. Cohen S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7626-7631Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and 22Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D.

Duncan L. Mufti D. Baker J. Stevenson P.G. Lehner P.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2418-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Second, mammalian TSG101 and VPS28 also function together as part of a soluble ∼350-kDa ESCRT-I complex (22Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 25Bishop N. Woodman P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11735-11742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, a significant limitation in our understanding of the human ESCRT-I complex is that orthologs of VPS37 have not yet been identified in animals. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, TSG101 is a multifunctional, multidomain protein composed of an N-terminal ubiquitin E2 variant (UEV) domain (residues 1–145), a proline-rich region (residues ∼146–215), a predicted central coiled-coil region (residues ∼240–311), and a conserved helical C-terminal domain (residues ∼330–390). TSG101 appears to function primarily as an adaptor protein, and the different regions of TSG101 engage in a series of protein/protein interactions within the ESCRT-I complex, including the following. 1) The TSG101 N-terminal UEV domain binds P(S/T)AP peptide motifs. Potential cellular binding sites include a downstream PTAP motif within TSG101 itself and P(S/T)AP motifs within at least two other Class E proteins, HRS and AIP1 (17Lu Q. Hope L.W. Brasch M.

Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). 2) The C-terminal region of TSG101/Vps23p binds VPS28/Vps28p (14Katzmann D.J. Odorizzi G. Emr S.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 893-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar, 25Bishop N. Woodman P. J. Biol.

Virol. 2003; 77: 4794-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This interaction is important for MVB formation and may also control the steady-state levels of TSG101 (30Feng G.H. Lih C.J. Cohen S.N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1736-1741PubMed Google Scholar). 3) Finally, deletion of a predicted central coiledcoil region within Vps23p blocks incorporation of Vps37p into the ESCRT-I complex, suggesting that this region of Vps23p may form (or contain) the Vps37p-binding site (16Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D. Cell. 2001; 106: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). Given the parallels between MVB vesicle formation and HIV-1 budding, it has become important to characterize the different TSG101 protein/protein interactions that function in ESCRT-I assembly and test their involvement in virus budding. The goals of this study were therefore to identify human VPS37 orthologs and to test the importance of known TSG101/ESCRT-I interactions in HIV-1 budding. VPS37 Homology Searches—In one procedure, the yeast Srn2p/Vps37p protein sequence (NCBI accession number NP_013220) was submitted to the NCBI PSI-BLAST search engine and compared with all known proteins. The first iteration identified apparent VPS37 orthologs in fungi and Japanese rice (NCBI accession number AAS01952). A composite profile built from these sequences was then compared with all known proteins to identify VPS37 orthologs in animals. All sequences above the default threshold (18 total) were incorporated into the search profile, and a final iteration identified four human proteins: VPS37A/HCRP1 (hepatocellular carcinoma-related protein 1; NCBI LocusLink 137492), VPS37B (NCBI LocusLink 79720), VPS37C (NCBI LocusLink 55048), and VPS37D/WBSCR24 (Williams-Beuren syndrome chromosome region 24; NCBI LocusLink 155382). In a second procedure, the five proteins shown to bind TSG101 in a global analysis of protein/protein interactions in Drosophila (31Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C. Chaudhuri A. Kuang B. Li Y. Hao Y.L.

Science. 2003; 302: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar) were compared against the human protein data base. One of the Drosophila proteins (CG1115-PA; NCBI accession number NP_649518) showed clear sequence similarities to VPS37B and VPS37C (E ≤ 1 × 10-6) and weaker similarities to VPS37A (E = 1.4) and VPS37D (E = 0.034). Plasmid Construction—Mammalian expression vectors for wild-type (WT) and PTAP mutant HIV-1NL4-3, WT and mutant VPS4A, and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-resistant TSG101 (TSG*-FLAG) have been described (6Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Additional point mutations were introduced into pIRES-TSG*-FLAG using Kunkel or QuikChange (Stratagene) mutagenesis. Deletion mutants were created by PCR amplifying the desired region of pIRES-TSG*-FLAG and subcloning the product into pIRES2-EGFP. VPS37B constructs were PCR-amplified from an expressed sequence tag (DDBJ/GenBank™/EBI accession number BE909752; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) with the sequence encoding the C-terminal FLAG epitope within the 3′-primer. VPS28 (GenBank™ accession number BC019321) constructs were PCR-amplified from a QUICK-Clone human HeLa cDNA pool (Clontech) using gene-specific primers. For expression in Escherichia coli, the VPS28 coding region was subcloned into WISP01-69, a modified pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), to create WISP01-136, which expresses VPS28 as a GST fusion protein. Yeast Two-hybrid Binding Assays—Global and directed yeast two-hybrid screens were performed as described previously (19Pornillos O. Higginson D.S. Stray K.M. Fisher R.D. Garrus J.E. Payne M. He G.P. Wang H.E. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 26von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E. Wang H.E.

Briefly, directed two-hybrid assays with full-length TSG101 and VPS37B and deletion constructs were performed using the Matchmaker Gal4 yeast two-hybrid 3 system (Clontech). In each experiment, five test clones and five controls were selected at random and tested for α-galactosidase activity in -Leu/-Trp/-Ade/-His X-α-gal (50 μg/ml) plate assays. Directed two-hybrid assays with full-length TSG101 and VPS28 and deletion constructs were performed using the MP30 vector system (32Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To identify yeast colonies producing β-galactosidase, cells were lifted onto filter paper disks, lysed by freeze-thawing in liquid nitrogen, and assayed with X-β-gal. For quantitation of β-galactosidase activity, ∼20 colonies/plate were randomly selected, pooled, grown on synthetic liquid medium, and assayed with chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside or o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (6Garrus J.E. von Schwedler U.K. Pornillos O.W. Morham S.G. Zavitz K.H. Wang H.E. Wettstein D.A. Stray K.M. Cote M. Rich R.L. Myszka D.G. Sundquist W.I. Cell. 2001; 107: 55-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). VPS37B-FLAG Immunoprecipitation Experiments—293T cells (10-cm plate) were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with 13 μg of pCIneo-VPS37B-FLAG or the control pCIneo-FLAG vector. Cells were harvested after 24 h; lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 containing 2 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin; and then clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min. Lysate (∼1 mg of total protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose affinity beads (Sigma, A 2220). Unbound proteins were removed by lysis buffer washes, and bound proteins were stripped by boiling in SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Western Blotting—Virus from the supernatants of transfected cells was pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 25 μl of 1× SDS gel loading buffer. Samples (5–7.5 μl) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred, blocked (typically with 5% nonfat dry milk, but as low as 0.1% when detecting endogenous TSG101), blotted with antisera, and protein bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce). Transfected human embryonic kidney 293T cells (1 well from a 6-well plate) were harvested directly into 40–45 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS) and incubated on ice for 4 min. Samples were clarified by microcentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 4 min at 4 °C, and lysates were resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS gel loading buffer. Aliquots (5–10 μl) were resolved by 12–17.5% SDS-PAGE. Bound antibody was detected by ECL using SuperSignal West Pico (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-HIV CA protein antibody (1:2000), rabbit anti-HIV MA protein antibody (1:25,000; Didier Trono, Geneva, Switzerland), murine monoclonal anti-TSG101 antibody 4A10 (1:100–1000; GeneTex, Inc.), murine monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M2 (1:5000; Sigma), and rabbit anti-NEDD4 antibody (1:5000; Pharmingen). Anti-VPS28 antibodies (1:500–1500) were raised against recombinant VPS28 (see below) in New Zealand White rabbits (Covance, Inc.). Gel Filtration—293T cells transfected with pCIneo-VPS37B-FLAG (as described for the immunoprecipitation experiments) were harvested after 24 h; lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 0.1% Tween 20 containing 2 μm pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin; and clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min. The lysate was fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S300 column (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins in the 1.4-ml fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed with acetone (22Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and analyzed by Western blotting. Apparent molecular masses were obtained by comparison with a standard curve derived from chromatography of proteins of known mass. Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips on 60-mm dishes were cotransfected with 100 ng of vector expressing VPS37B-FLAG and 900 ng of vector expressing WT or K173Q VPS4A-GFP using 2.5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were fixed and permeabilized 24 h post-transfection in 4% paraformaldehyde and phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (1:500) at 4 °C for 16 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:500) to detect FLAG-tagged VPS37 proteins. Images were collected as single wavelengths on an Olympus FVX confocal fluorescent microscope using Fluoview Version 2.0.39 software. 0.3–0.7-μm-thick Z sections are shown. Gag-VPS37B Rescue Experiments—All Gag and Gag-VPS37B expression constructs were based on pGag-GFP (a gift from Dr. Marilyn Resh) (33Hermida-Matsumoto L. Resh M.D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8670-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for GagΔPTAP-GFP and GagΔp6 were created as described (19Pornillos O. Higginson D.S. Stray K.M. Fisher R.D. Garrus J.E. Payne M. He G.P. Wang H.E. Morham S.G. Sundquist W.I. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and GagΔPTAP-VPS37B and Gag-VPS37B expression constructs were created by replacing the GFP coding region with the VPS37B coding sequence. Plasmid DNA encoding either Gag-GFP or Gag-VPS37B constructs was cotransfected together with GagΔp6 plasmid DNA into 293T cells (2 ml, 6-well plates). Protein expression and release of viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs) were analyzed by Western blotting 24 h post-transfection. Viral Replication Assays—Infectivity of HIV-1 particles released into the supernatants from cells transfected with R9 constructs was determined in single-cycle MAGIC replication assays as described (34von Schwedler U.K. Stemmler T.L. Klishko V.Y. Li S. Albertine K.H. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I.

Blue cells and syncytia were counted 2 days post-infection. TSG101 Depletion/Replacement Experiments—Synthetic 21-nucleotide siRNA duplexes with 2-nucleotide 2′-deoxythymidine 3′- or uridine 3′-overhangs were targeted to TSG101 coding nucleotides 413–433 (35Elbashir S.M.

The first transfection was with 50 nm siRNA duplexes and either 2 μg of pSL1180 carrier plasmid (Amersham Biosciences) or 2 μg of WT or mutant siRNA-resistant pIRES-TSG*-FLAG expression vector. The second transfection was performed with the same siRNA duplex (50 nm) and 500 ng of vector R9. Viral supernatants and cytoplasmic lysates were harvested after an additional 24–28 h and analyzed for protein expression and virus infectivity. All transfections and subsequent analyses were repeated at least three independent times. Recombinant VPS28 Purification—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with WISP01-136 were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to express recombinant GST-VPS28 and grown for 4 h at room temperature. Following cell lysis, soluble GST-VPS28 was purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (GSTPrep FF, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 20 mm glutathione. Following dialysis in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, the fusion protein was cleaved with 1 mg of tobacco etch virus protease/100 mg of protein for 24 h at 23 °C; free GST was removed by two rounds of glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography; and VPS28 protein was purified to homogeneity by anion exchange chromatography on immobilized Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). VPS28 eluted at ∼300 mm NaCl from a linear gradient of 50 mm to 1 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Detection of Proteins Incorporated into Virus Particles—Human MT-4 T-cells were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 by co-culture as described previously (36Welker R. Hohenberg H. Tessmer U. Huckhagel C. Krausslich H.G. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1168-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 60 h post-infection, a supernatant was harvested, and virus was purified by pelleting through a 20% (w/w) sucrose cushion, followed by velocity centrifugation through an iodixanol gradient as described (37Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Particles were concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and the purity of the samples was verified by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining. For Western blotting, virus particles corresponding to 1 μg of CA protein (adjusted by comparison with purified recombinant CA protein) (38Groβ I. Hohenberg H. Krausslich H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of recombinant CA protein (control) and extracts from 105 uninfected MT-4 cells were separated by 17.5% SDS-PAGE (200:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide). Identification of Candidate Human VPS37 Proteins—As discussed above, the human ESCRT-I complex presumably contains TSG101, VPS28, and VPS37. However, VPS37 orthologs have not yet been identified in humans or any other higher eukaryote, apparently because the primary sequence has diverged considerably from yeast Vps37p (which shares <20% sequence identity with any known human protein). We therefore pursued three different approaches to identify VPS37 candidates, and these approaches independently identified the same family of human proteins. In the first approach, the yeast Vps37p protein sequence was used to search for human VPS37 candidates by creating PSI-BLAST composite profiles of putative VPS37 orthologs from higher eukaryotes (see “Materials and Methods” for details). Four human proteins were identified using this approach: VPS37A/HCRP1 (39Xu Z. Liang L. Wang H. Li T. Zhao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1057-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), VPS37B, VPS37C, and VPS37D/WB-SCR24. In the second approach, we searched for human homologs of the five proteins previously shown to bind TSG101 in a global map of Drosophila protein/protein interactions (31Giot L. Bader J.S. Brouwer C.

Adsorbate motion both along and perpendicular to the rows of the Cu110 surface occurs readily, in marked contrast to the behavior seen for equilibrium diffusion processes. The experimental findings for the probability and direction of the molecular motion can be understood as a manifestation of strong coupling between the adsorbates' lateral degrees of freedom and the substrate electronic excitation produced by the femtosecond laser radiation."

A large class of precursor proteins carries amino-terminal-cleavable targeting signals (presequences) that direct these preproteins across both mitochondrial membranes into the matrix. The preproteins are recognized by receptors of the translocase of the outer membrane and transported across the outer membrane by the general import pore. After traversing the intermembrane space, the preproteins are recognized by the presequence translocase of the inner membrane (TIM23 complex). 1The abbreviations used are: TIM, translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane; Pam16S, soluble domain of Pam16 lacking the 25 amino-terminal amino acid residues; Pam18J, J-domain of Pam18; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Mdj1, mitochondrial DnaJ protein 1; Mge1, mitochondrial GrpE; mtHsp70, mitochondrial heat shock protein 70 (Ssc1); PAM, presequence translocase-associated motor; YP, yeast-rich medium; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. The presequence translocase forms a voltage-activated translocation channel across the inner membrane through which the loosely folded precursor polypeptides pass (7Truscott K.N. Kovermann P.

The membrane potential across the inner membrane, however, only promotes the translocation of the positively charged amino-terminal presequences across the inner membrane. The import of the major portion of the precursor polypeptide chain into the matrix requires the function of the presequence translocase-associated motor (PAM) (8Strub A. Lim J.H. Pfanner N. Voos W.

The core of the PAM complex is formed by the mitochondrial heat shock protein of 70 kDa (mtHsp70, also termed Ssc1 in yeast). mtHsp70 drives the translocation and the unfolding of the preprotein by an ATP-dependent reaction (12Voos W.

Biol. 2004; 11: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Besides the ATP-utilizing core component mtHsp70, which is essential for cell viability, four other essential cochaperones are needed for the motor function of PAM. The membrane protein Tim44 is associated with the TIM23 complex and stably interacts with mtHsp70 in a nucleotide-sensitive manner (15Neupert W. Brunner M. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Recently, an inner membrane-bound J-protein termed Pam18 (Tim14) was identified as a component of the PAM complex that plays an essential role in preprotein translocation (28Truscott K.N. Voos W.

Surprisingly, a further J-related protein, Pam16 (Tim16), was subsequently found and shown to be an additional essential subunit of the PAM complex (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y.

Pam18 and Pam16 form a stable subcomplex that associates with the presequence translocase and the other motor subunits (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C.

However, Pam18 contains a J-domain that is responsible for the interaction with Hsp70 and is conserved in all proteins of the J-protein family (33Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The Pam16 domain possesses a similar length and predicted secondary structure as the Pam18 domain, but the characteristic sequence motif HPD (His-Pro-Asp) that is strictly conserved in all known J-proteins is missing in Pam16. As expected for a protein of the DnaJ family, the purified J-domain of Pam18 stimulated the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 (28Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J.

Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Initial studies with purified full-length Pam16 did not show a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A.

Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular function of Pam16 in the protein import motor remained unknown. Here we report that Pam16 inhibits the Pam18-mediated stimulation of the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. Moreover, Pam16 cannot be converted to a J-type cochaperone by inclusion of the HPD motif. The mutant Pam16 remains functional in vitro and in vivo but cannot replace the function of Pam18. Pam16, thus, does not represent a typical Hsp70 cochaperone of the J-protein family but, rather, serves to control the activity of Pam18. Yeast Strains—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. In the strain JDY1, PAM16 is expressed under the control of a galactose-inducible promotor. To construct this strain, a region of 80 base pairs upstream of the open reading frame YJL104W (encoding Pam16) was replaced in the strain YPH501 by a cassette containing the GAL1 promotor (37Longtine M.S.

Haploid cells were obtained by tetrad dissection. The cells were transformed with plasmids containing the PAM16 gene (pGB8064) or PAM16-HPD (pJD15) expressed under its own promotor or with the empty vector (pRS414). The cells were grown on yeast-rich medium (YP) containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose. The cell suspension was plated in different dilutions on YP agar plates containing 2% galactose and 2% raffinose or 2% glucose to repress expression under the GAL1 promotor.

Protein Expression and Purification—For production of Pam16S, the coding region of PAM16 (YJL104W), corresponding to amino acid residues 26-149, was amplified by PCR using the primers JD30 (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGGAAGACAAGCGGCTTCACAA) and JD6 (GGCCTCGAGCTACTGATTGCTGCTTGC). To obtain the Pam16S-HPD construct, the open reading frame was amplified by PCR in two parts with the primers JD5 (ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAGGAGCTCACAGGGCTTTCATA)/JD23 (TTCCACCTTTGTCCGGGTGGTTAACCTCAAATAGATAG) and JD22 (TGAGGTTAACCACCCGGACAAAGGTGGAAGCTTCTACTT)/JD6, which introduce the HPD mutation at position 88-90. The two fragments were subsequently fused by a second PCR reaction, and the resulting construct was cloned. PCR fragments encoding the soluble domains of Pam16S and Pam16S-HPD were amplified with primers JD30 and JD6 and cloned into the vector pET10N (7Truscott K.N. Kovermann P. Geissler A. Merlin A. Meijer M. Driessen A.J.M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Wagner R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1074-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) to introduce an amino-terminal decahistidine tag. After induction of protein expression in Escherichia coli cells, the tagged proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography, and the interaction between Pam16 and Pam18 was analyzed as described (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondria were isolated from the yeast strain NZY2 expressing mtHsp70 (Ssc1) with a carboxyl-terminal hexahistidine tag from its authentic chromosomal location. Mitochondria were resuspended thoroughly in lysis buffer SA (0.3% Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, 1× proteinase inhibitor (Roche Applied Science), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm ATP). After vigorous shaking for 10 min and 5 min of centrifugation with 13,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was incubated with Ni-NTA beads (washed in buffer SA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with buffer SD (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 20 mm imidazole, and 1× proteinase inhibitor). Bound proteins were eluted with buffer SE (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 250 mm imidazole), and the purified Ssc1-His was concentrated and desalted in a Microcon YM-30 filter (Millipore) and stored frozen at -80 °C. Mge1 and Mdj1 were isolated essentially as described previously (19Dekker P.J.T. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hexahistidine-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli cells. After lysis of the cells, the proteins were purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. ATPase Assay—Purified Ssc1 (1 μm) and Mge1 (2 μm; corresponding to 1 μm dimer) were incubated together with other cochaperones as indicated in 50 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing [α-32P]ATP (12 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 5 μm ATP at 30 °C. Samples (2 μl) were taken at various time points (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2.5 min) and directly spotted on TLC plates (PEI-Cellulose F, Merck). Nucleotides were separated by thin layer chromatography in 0.4 m LiCl, 3.6% acetic acid and analyzed by autoradiography. Import and Coimmunoprecipitation Reactions—Radiolabeled preproteins were generated by in vitro transcription/translation and imported into isolated mitochondria essentially as described previously (38Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Import reactions were performed after a heat treatment at 37 °C for 15 min to induce non-permissive conditions. Import was stopped by the addition of 1 μm valinomycin and treatment with 75 μg/ml proteinase K. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and mtHsp70-bound proteins were recovered by co-immunoprecipitation as described (16Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Translocation intermediates were generated by a preincubation of radiolabeled preproteins with 4 μm methotrexate to stabilize the conformation of a carboxyl-terminal dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain (39Geissler A. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Voos W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7097-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments for interaction of the intermediates with mtHsp70 were performed as described above except that mitochondria were not treated with proteinase K. Tim23ProtA was expressed in wild-type (YPH499) and pam16-1 (YPHBG-mia1-1) cells from the plasmid pPR91. The isolation of TIM23 translocase complexes via a protein A-tagged Tim23 was performed as described previously (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Pam16 Inhibits the Pam18-mediated Stimulation of the ATPase Activity of mtHsp70—Purified full-length Pam16 did not stimulate the ATPase activity of purified mtHsp70 in a soluble system (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Pam16 contains a hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region outside the J-related domain (Fig. 1A). This segment is likely used for association of Pam16 with the inner membrane (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It was conceivable that the hydrophobic segment interfered with the function of purified Pam16 in the assay for the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. We, thus, generated a shortened form of Pam16 lacking the amino-terminal 25 amino acid residues but retaining the complete J-related domain, including the three conserved α-helices typical for DnaJ family proteins (Fig. 1A). Upon expression in E. coli cells with an amino-terminal His tag, the shortened form of Pam16 was fully soluble and termed Pam16S. The ATPase activity of purified mtHsp70 was studied by determining the hydrolysis of [α-32P]ATP. Pam16S did not stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 even when the nucleotide exchange factor Mge1 was present (Fig. 1B). We tested Pam16S and purified full-length Pam16 in a broad concentration range but never observed a stimulation of the ATPase activity (not shown). This was in contrast to the strong stimulation of the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 by the purified J-domain of Pam18, termed Pam18J (Fig. 1B) (28Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Müller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29D'Silva P. Schilke B. Walter W. Andrew A. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We then asked if Pam16S enhanced the stimulating activity of Pam18J by adding both proteins together. Surprisingly, Pam16S significantly inhibited the stimulation of the mtHsp70 ATPase by Pam18J (Fig. 1B). Maximal inhibition of the ATPase stimulation by Pam18J was already obtained at a 1:1 ratio of Pam16Sversus Pam18J (Fig. 1C), demonstrating a highly efficient inhibitory effect. Similarly, purified full-length Pam16 inhibited the stimulatory effect of Pam18J (not shown). The inhibitory effect of Pam16 on the stimulation of the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 was not altered in the presence of substrate proteins or small peptides (data not shown). These findings suggested that Pam16 functions in an antagonistic manner to Pam18. Two possibilities for the inhibitory mechanism of Pam16 were conceivable. (i) Because Pam16 displays a similarity to the J-domain of Pam18 and other J-proteins (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it may bind to the J-interaction site of mtHsp70 and, thus, compete for the binding of Pam18. (ii) Pam16 specifically antagonizes the function of Pam18 but not of other J-proteins. To distinguish between those alternatives, we analyzed the stimulation of the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 by the mitochondrial matrix J-protein Mdj1 (25Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Mdj1 stimulated the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 in a manner comparable with the stimulation by Pam18J (Fig. 2) (28Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Müller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29D'Silva P. Schilke B. Walter W. Andrew A. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13839-13844Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the addition of Pam16S did not impair the Mdj1-mediated stimulation of the ATPase activity (Fig. 2). Thus, Pam16S does not block the interaction site of mtHsp70 for J-proteins but selectively impairs the activity of Pam18. Inclusion of the HPD Motif in Pam16 Does Not Alter Its Interaction with and Inhibition of Pam18—The strongly conserved HPD sequence motif in the center of a J-domain (33Greene M.K. Maskos K. Landry S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6108-6113Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) that is required for the interaction with Hsp70 and the stimulation of the ATPase activity is missing in Pam16. We asked if the generation of an HPD motif could convert Pam16 to a protein with an activity similar to other proteins of the DnaJ family, i.e. a stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. Because the three characteristic α-helices and their spacing are well conserved between Pam16 and Pam18 (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we replaced the three amino acids DKE (Asp, Lys, Glu) of Pam16 by HPD at the position corresponding to the HPD motif of Pam18 (Fig. 3A). Pam16S-HPD with an amino-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli cells and purified to homogeneity (Fig. 3B). We first analyzed if Pam16S-HPD was still able to form the characteristic protein complex with Pam18. Purified Pam16S-HPD was immobilized on a Ni-NTA-agarose column and incubated with the purified J-domain of Pam18 (fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST)) (28Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Müller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Pam18J efficiently bound to Pam16S-HPD (Fig. 3C, lane 9), whereas glutathione S-transferase alone was only present in the unbound fraction (Fig. 3C, lane 6). For comparison, Pam16S immobilized on Ni-NTA-agarose bound Pam18J with similar efficiency (Fig. 3C, lane 7). We conclude that Pam16 with an HPD motif is still able to interact efficiently with the J-domain of Pam18. To analyze a possible J-protein-like function of Pam16 with an HPD motif, we determined the ATPase activity of mtHsp70. However, Pam16S-HPD was not able to stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 (Fig. 4A). To exclude the possibility that Pam16S-HPD may be an inactive protein, we asked if it displayed a similar activity as Pam16S, i.e. an inhibition of the Pam18-mediated stimulation of mtHsp70. When Pam16S-HPD was included in the mtHsp70 ATPase assay together with Pam18J, the stimulation of the mtHsp70 ATPase activity by Pam18J was inhibited in a manner comparable with the effect of Pam16S (Fig. 4B). Therefore, Pam16S-HPD is functional in vitro like Pam16S. Pam16-HPD Is Functional in Vivo but Does Not Substitute for Pam18—To obtain in vivo evidence if Pam16 with an HPD motif was functional, we expressed full-length Pam16-HPD in yeast cells. The cellular amount of the wild-type form of Pam16 was reduced by placing the gene under the control of a galactoseinducible promoter. In the absence of galactose in the medium, the growth of the Pam16-depleted cells was impaired (Fig. 5A, row 2). The expression of wild-type Pam16 from a plasmid restored the growth as expected (Fig. 5A, row 3). Expression of Pam16-HPD fully restored cell growth despite the depletion of wild-type Pam16 (Fig. 5A, row 4), suggesting that Pam16-HPD is functional in vivo. Under the depletion conditions small amounts of the wild-type protein are still present and may sustain cell viability when Pam16-HPD is co-expressed. To determine whether Pam16-HPD could fully substitute for wild-type Pam16, we generated a yeast strain lacking the PAM16 gene and sustained its viability by expression of Pam16 from a plasmid (Fig. 5B, right panel). By plasmid shuffling, the Pam16 plasmid was replaced by a plasmid expressing Pam16-HPD. The resulting strain showed the same growth behavior as a yeast strain expressing wild-type Pam16 (Fig. 5B, left panel), demonstrating that Pam16-HPD fully replaces the function of Pam16 in vivo. We then asked if Pam16-HPD was able to replace Pam18 in vivo. We generated a yeast strain lacking the PAM18 gene and expressed Pam18 from a plasmid (Fig. 5C, right panel). When the Pam18 plasmid was replaced by a Pam16 plasmid or a Pam16-HDP plasmid, however, the pam18Δ cells were not viable (Fig. 5C, left panel). Thus neither Pam16 itself nor the Pam16 construct containing the HPD motif can substitute for Pam18 in vivo. Pam16 Regulates the Preprotein Interaction of mtHsp70 via Pam18—These results indicate a role for Pam16 during the import process that is different from the Hsp70 stimulatory function of other J-proteins. We, therefore, analyzed the consequences of a conditional mutant of Pam16 on the interaction of mtHsp70 with precursor proteins during the import reaction. We imported the radiolabeled preprotein Su9-DHFR, a fusion protein between the presequence of the Fo-ATPase subunit 9 and dihydrofolate reductase, into intact wild-type and pam16-1 mitochondria under non-permissive conditions and determined the amount of imported protein that is bound to mtHsp70. After completion of the translocation reaction into the matrix, mitochondria were lysed, and a co-immunoprecipitation was performed with antibodies directed against mtHsp70. Although in wild-type mitochondria only a low amount of proteins remained bound to mtHsp70, pam16-1 mitochondria showed a significantly increased amount of Su9-DHFR bound to mtHsp70 (Fig. 6A). Although less preprotein could be imported into pam16-1 mitochondria, the imported protein interacted much more efficiently with mtHsp70 in the matrix (Fig. 6A, quantification). Using the preprotein b2(167)Δ-DHFR, a fusion protein between an amino-terminal portion of cytochrome b2 and DHFR, a genuine translocation intermediate can be generated resulting in a stable complex between the preprotein and the translocases of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (39Geissler A. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Voos W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7097-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 40Eilers M. Schatz G.

We used this approach to determine the binding activity of mtHsp70 to preproteins in transit. As previously reported, about 1% of the translocation intermediate is recovered in a co-precipitation with antibodies against mtHsp70 in wild-type mitochondria (16Voisine C. Craig E.A. Zufall N. von Ahsen O. Pfanner N. Voos W. Cell. 1999; 97: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 43Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, a co-immunoprecipitation of arrested radiolabeled b2(167)Δ-DHFR revealed that the amount of co-precipitated protein in pam16-1 mitochondria was significantly lower than in wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 6B). The influence of Pam16 on the interaction between mtHsp70 and translocation intermediates is, therefore, different from its effect on the binding of mtHsp70 to fully imported preproteins. We asked if the differential behavior of mtHsp70 toward preproteins could be explained by the interaction of Pam16 with Pam18. Previous studies showed that in a different mutant strain of Pam16 (pam16-3), the interaction of Pam18 with the TIM23 complex was inhibited (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether the pam16-1 mitochondria used here were also impaired in the Pam18-TIM23 interaction, we isolated the TIM23 translocase complex from wild-type and pam16-1 mitochondria and tested both preparations for the presence of Pam18. Although in wild-type mitochondria a tight interaction of Pam18 with the TIM23 complex was observed as expected, the majority of Pam18 was not found in association with the TIM23 complex in pam16-1 mitochondria either in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 6C), indicating that Pam18 cannot stably interact with the translocase complex in the presence of the mutant protein Pam16-1. We conclude that Pam16 acts as an adaptor protein regulating the activity of mtHsp70 at the import pore via the localization of Pam18. The recently identified protein Pam16 is associated with the TIM23 translocase complex that provides the aqueous channel for the transport of presequence-carrying preproteins into the mitochondrial matrix (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Pam16 contains a characteristic protein domain that has a high sequence homology to Hsp70 cochaperones of the DnaJ family. However, an important sequence motif of the J-domain, the tripeptide HPD, is missing in Pam16 (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We addressed the question if Pam16 can act as a genuine J-protein in regulating the biological activity of mtHsp70. Our results show that despite the presence of the J-related domain Pam16 does not function as a J-protein, i.e. stimulate the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 of the mitochondrial matrix. This effect is not due to the absence of the crucial HPD motif required for the activity of DnaJ-like proteins since the inclusion of the motif into the Pam16 sequence did not result in a stimulatory function on mtHsp70 ATPase activity and, therefore, did not convert Pam16 to a J-type cochaperone. Pam16-HPD retained its full biological activity and could substitute for the essential function of wild-type Pam16 in sustaining cell viability. Although these results indicate that Pam16 represents a novel type of cochaperone, the question remains of which functional role Pam16 plays in the preprotein translocation activity of mtHsp70. Pam16 has been shown to interact with Pam18, another essential J-protein and component of the presequence translocase-associated motor (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The membrane protein Pam18 strongly stimulates the ATPase activity of mtHsp70 and is required for the import of presequence-containing mitochondrial proteins (28Truscott K.N. Voos W. Frazier A.E. Lind M. Li Y. Geissler A. Dudek J. Müller H. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Meisinger C. Guiard B. Rehling P. Pfanner N. J.

Strikingly, Pam16 antagonized the function of Pam18 in stimulating mtHsp70. This antagonistic effect was specific for Pam18 and not for other J-proteins interacting with mtHsp70, demonstrating that Pam16 did not occupy the J-interaction site of mtHsp70. The inhibitory effect of Pam16 is likely mediated by the formation of a stable subcomplex with Pam18 (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because Pam16 is crucial to promote protein translocation in vivo and into isolated mitochondria (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 32Kozany C. Mokranjac D. Sichting M. Neupert W. Hell K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 234-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), its inhibitory effect on Pam18 does not simply lead to an inhibition of mitochondrial preprotein translocation but is required for a proper function of the import motor complex. In pam16-1 mutant mitochondria precursor proteins that were fully imported into the matrix interacted more efficiently with mtHsp70 than in wild-type mitochondria. This most likely reflects an increased stimulatory action of the unrepressed Pam18 on the ATPase activity of mtHsp70, resulting in a higher affinity to substrate proteins. However, the increased substrate affinity of mtHsp70 seems not to be productive in the translocation reaction since pam16-1 mitochondria show a pronounced import defect (31Frazier A.E. Dudek J. Guiard B. Voos W. Li Y. Lind M. Meisinger C. Geissler A. Sickmann A. Meyer H.E. Bilanchone V. Cumsky M.G. Truscott K.N. Pfanner N. Rehling P. Nat. Struct. Mol.

The reduced translocation activity of pam16-1 mitochondria is reflected by the reduced binding affinity of mtHsp70 to preproteins arrested as translocation intermediates in the mitochondrial membranes. Due to the decreased amount of Pam18 that is found in association with the TIM23 translocase complex in pam16-1 mitochondria, Pam18 is not able to exert its stimulatory function on mtHsp70 at the translocation site. A continuous activity of Pam18 and mtHsp70 without a controlled assembly of all components of the presequence translocase and the motor during the translocation reaction would be unproductive and lead to an unnecessary energy consumption of mitochondria. We propose that Pam16 is involved in controlling the activity of Pam18 until the reaction cycle of mtHsp70 reaches a stage where the full activity of mtHsp70 is needed. Hence, an effective and localized regulation of the Pam18-mediated stimulation of mtHsp70 activity is a major characteristic of an efficient translocation process. We thank Dr. J. Höhfeld, Dr. K. N. Truscott and A. Frazier for discussion and I. Perschil and N. Zufall for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2142117669,"Coumarins and structurally related compounds have been recently shown to present anti-human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) activity. Among them, the dietary furanocoumarin imperatorin is present in citrus fruits, in culinary herbs, and in some medicinal plants. In this study we report that imperatorin inhibits either vesicular stomatitis virus-pseudotyped or gp160-enveloped recombinant HIV-1 infection in several T cell lines and in HeLa cells. These recombinant viruses express luciferase as a marker of viral replication. Imperatorin did not inhibit the reverse transcription nor the integration steps in the viral cell cycle. Using several 5′ long terminal repeat-HIV-1 constructs where critical response elements were either deleted or mutated, we found that the transcription factor Sp1 is critical for the inhibitory activity of imperatorin induced by both phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and HIV-1 Tat. Moreover in transient transfections imperatorin specifically inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced transcriptional activity of the Gal4-Sp1 fusion protein. Since Sp1 is also implicated in cell cycle progression we further studied the effect of imperatorin on cyclin D1 gene transcription and protein expression and in HeLa cell cycle progression. We found that imperatorin strongly inhibited cyclin D1 expression and arrested the cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These results highlight the potential of Sp1 transcription factor as a target for natural anti-HIV-1 compounds such as furanocoumarins that might have a potential therapeutic role in the management of AIDS.

These results highlight the potential of Sp1 transcription factor as a target for natural anti-HIV-1 compounds such as furanocoumarins that might have a potential therapeutic role in the management of AIDS. Furanocoumarins are abundant in citrus fruits, umbelliferous vegetables, and certain herbal medicines (1Murray R. Mendez J. Brown S. The Natural Coumarins: Occurrence, Chemistry and Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1982Google Scholar). Interest in these compounds has long been limited to psoralen, the mainstay of photodynamic therapy, but over the past few years there has been a growing interest in its prenylated derivatives spurred by the potent activity on drug metabolism of dietary compounds such as bergamottin and its dimeric analogs. While bergamottin is mainly contained in citrus plants, its isomer imperatorin is more widespread, occurring not only in lemon and lime oils, but also in the medicinal plant Angelica dahurica (2Baek N.I. Ahn E.M. Kim H.Y. Park Y.D. Arch. Pharm. Res. (Seoul). 2000; 23: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in popular culinary herbs such as parsnip, parsley, and fennel (1Murray R.

Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 165-169Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Despite its occurrence in edible plants, imperatorin shows potent pharmacological activity and has been studied for its anti-inflammatory and antitumoral activities (4Garcia-Argaez A.N. Ramirez Apan T.O. Parra Delgado H. Velazquez G. Martinez-Vazquez M. Planta Med. 2000; 66: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 5Ban H.S. Lim S.S. Suzuki K. Jung S.H. Lee S. Lee Y.S.

Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 1905-1911PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover imperatorin and its close analog heraclenin have been reported to show anti-HIV activity with EC50 (effective concentration 50) in the micromolar range (7Wu T.S. Tsang Z.J. Wu P.L. Lin F.W. Li C.Y. Teng C.M. Lee K.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2001; 9: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the molecular mechanism underlying this light-independent activity. Since the coumarin calanolide A shows unique anti-HIV activity and is currently undergoing clinical trials in AIDS patients (8Yu D. Suzuki M. Xie L. Morris-Natschke S.L. Lee K.H. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 322-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), we became interested in the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of imperatorin, the archetypal antiviral dietary coumarin.

The HIV-1 genome contains three structural and six regulatory genes, which encode structural viral proteins and six unique regulatory/accessory proteins that play a critical role in HIV-1 gene expression, transmission, and pathogenesis (9Turner B.G. Summers M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 enters permissive cells by fusion of its envelope with the plasma membrane subsequent to gp120 binding to the CD4 receptor molecule. This interaction induces a conformational change that promotes secondary gp120 binding to the coreceptors CXCR4 or CCR5, and subsequently gp41 undergoes conformational changes that allow the interaction of the NH2-terminal fusion peptide of gp41 with the cell membrane (10Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar, 11Clapham P.R. Reeves J.D. Simmons G. Dejucq N. Hibbitts S. McKnight A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Early after primary infection the viral genome is retrotranscribed and integrated into the host genome (12Popov S. Rexach M. Zybarth G. Reiling N. Lee M.A. Ratner L. Lane C.M. Moore M.S. Blobel G. Bukrinsky M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The postintegration phase of the viral cycle preferentially occurs in activated cells and is regulated by the collaborative action of viral regulatory proteins and cellular factors on the long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter, which determines the extent of HIV-1 gene transcription and the level of viral replication in the infected cells (13Stevenson M. Stanwick T.L. Dempsey M.P. Lamonica C.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 14Pereira L.A. Bentley K. Peeters A. Churchill M.J. Deacon N.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 663-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HIV-1-LTR promoter is ∼640 nucleotides long and has binding sites for many cellular transcription factors and a cis-activating stem-loop RNA structure called trans-activating response element (TAR), which is located from positions +1 to +59 of the HIV-1-LTR (15Hauber J. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 673-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The TAR element represents the main binding site for the HIV-1 regulatory protein Tat (17Berkhout B. Silverman R.H. Jeang K.T. Cell. 1989; 59: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 18Dingwall C. Ernberg I. Gait M.J. Green S.M. Heaphy S. Karn J. Lowe A.D. Singh M.

Science. 1991; 252: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Through interaction with TAR, Tat recruits a host cell protein kinase complex, pTEFb, comprised of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 and cyclin T1, which binds to the loop region of TAR (20Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 21Chun R.F. Jeang K.T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7056-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). As a consequence of the pTEFb recruitment to the HIV-1 promoter complex, the COOH-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase II is phosphorylated (21Chun R.F. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27888-27894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Zhou M. Nekhai S. Bharucha D.C. Kumar A. Ge H. Price D.H. Egly J.M. Brady J.N. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 320: 925-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to the TAR binding activity, Tat also interacts with other cellular transcription factors that regulate the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1-LTR promoter (16Gaynor R. AIDS. 1992; 6: 347-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 27Gaynor R.B. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 193: 51-77PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ptak R.G. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The core promoter region of the HIV-1-LTR contains three tandem Sp1 binding sites and two κB elements located upstream of the TATA box. Although the κB enhancer has been considered the main inducible cis-acting element (29Hiscott J. Kwon H. Genin P. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), several reports suggest that the interaction between Sp1 and Tat is required for Tat-mediated HIV-1-LTR transactivation (30Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kamine J. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6828-6834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this sense, mutations of these Sp1 sites affect Tat-induced LTR transcriptional activity (32Berkhout B. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 139-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which Tat interacts with Sp1 are controversial, and although some authors have reported a physical association between Tat and Sp1 (33Jeang K.T. Chun R. Lin N.H. Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), others failed to detect such an interaction, suggesting that bridge proteins are required for Tat-Sp1 complex formation (34Loregian A. Bortolozzo K. Boso S. Caputo A. Palu G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 543: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For instance, modulation of Sp1 phosphorylation by Tat-mediated recruitment of this factor to DNA-dependent protein kinase complex results in up-regulated expression of the HIV-1-LTR (35Chun R.F. Semmes O.J. Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2615-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover it has been recently shown that pTEFb may be recruited to the preinitiation complexes through physical association of cyclin T1 with DNA-bound Sp1. This interaction allows robust HIV-1-LTR activation irrespective of pTEFb-Tat-TAR ternary complex formation (36Yedavalli V.S. Benkirane M. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6404-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), highlighting the importance of Sp1 in HIV-1 replication by both Tat-dependent and -independent pathways and its potential as a target for the development of new anti-HIV compounds. Efforts to find an effective anti-HIV chemotherapy have been mainly focused on the development of chemicals targeting viral proteins, which are essential for HIV-1 replication (37Yeni P.G. Hammer S.M. Carpenter C.C. Cooper D.A. Fischl M.A. Gatell J.M. Gazzard B.G. Hirsch M.S. Jacobsen D.M. Katzenstein D.A. Montaner J.S. Richman D.D. Saag M.S. Schechter M. Schooley R.T. Thompson M.A. Vella S. Volberding P.A. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 288: 222-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This antiviral therapy presents important limitations (28Ptak R.G. Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2002; 11: 1099-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and therefore the development of new anti-HIV agents is focusing on novel structures and/or new action mechanisms. In this sense, plant-derived natural products such as the coumarin derivatives are emerging as potent anti-HIV agents (8Yu D. Suzuki M. Xie L. Morris-Natschke S.L. Lee K.H. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 322-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the anti-HIV effects of several furanocoumarins, and we showed that imperatorin is a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 replication in both primary T lymphocytes and transformed cell lines. We present evidence that imperatorin inhibits the transcriptional activity of the HIV-1-LTR promoter through a signaling pathway involving the activation of the Sp1 transcription factor. Cell Lines and Reagents—MT-2 and Jurkat cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2mml-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml), maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, and splinted twice a week. HeLa and 293T cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and splinted when confluent. Imperatorin, heraclenin, and heraclenol were isolated from Opopanax chironium (38Appendino G. Bianchi F. Bader A. Campagnuolo C. Fattorusso E. Taglialatela-Scafati O. Blanco-Molina M. Macho A.

Psoralen and all other reagents not cited above or later were purchased from Sigma. Plasmids—The AP-1-luciferase (AP-1-Luc) plasmid was constructed by inserting three copies of an SV40 AP-1 binding site into the XhoI site of pGL-2 promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The KBF-Luc contains three copies of the major histocompatibility complex enhancer κB site upstream of the conalbumin promoter followed by the luciferase gene (39Yano O. Kanellopoulos J. Kieran M. Le Bail O. Israel A. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The vector pNL4-3.Luc.R–E– (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) from N. Landau, as described in Ref. 40Connor R.I. Chen B.K. Choe S. Landau N.R. Virology. 1995; 206: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar, contains the firefly luciferase gene inserted into the pNL4-3 nef gene. Two frameshifts (5′ Env and Vpr amino acid 26) render this clone Env– and Vpr–. The pcDNA3-VSV contains the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein and was obtained from Dr. Arenzana-Seisdedos (Institute Pasteur, Paris, France), and the pcDNA3-Tat expression vector has been described previously (41Macho A. Calzado M.A. Jimenez-Reina L. Ceballos E. Leon J. Muñoz E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7543-7551Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The plasmid epNL3 was constructed by EcoRI/XhoI digestion of pNL4-3, and the fragment containing the HIV-1 env gene was cloned into pcDNA3. The plasmids pXP1LTRwt, pXP1LTRΔTAR (deleted in the TAR region), and pXP1LTRΔκB (deleted in the κB enhancer element) and the pXP1Sp set of vectors have been described previously (42Gomez-Gonzalo M. Carretero M. Rullas J. Lara-Pezzi E. Aramburu J. Berkhout B. Alcami J. Lopez-Cabrera M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35435-35443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).

The Gal4-Luc reporter plasmid includes five Gal4 DNA binding sites fused to the luciferase gene (44Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol.

Production of VSV-pseudotyped and HIV-1 Recombinant Viruses— High titer VSV-pseudotyped or HIV-1 recombinant virus stocks were produced in 293T cells by cotransfection of pNL4-3.Luc.R–E– together with either the pcDNA3-VSV or the epNL3 plasmid encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein or HIV-1 envelope gene, respectively, using the calcium phosphate transfection system as described before (46Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 9.1.1-9.1.3Google Scholar). Supernatants, containing virus stocks, were harvested 48 h post-transfection, centrifuged 5 min at 500 × g to remove cell debris, and stored at –80 °C until use. Cell-free viral stock was tested using an enzyme-linked immunoassay for antigen HIV-p24 detection (INNOTEST™ hiv-Ag, INNOGENETICS, Barcelona, Spain). Cultures were infected at a dose of 200 ng of HIV-1 gag p24 protein. VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 Infection Assay—Cells (106/ml) were plated on a 24-well plate and were pretreated with the compounds for 30 min. After pretreatment, cells were inoculated with virus stocks (200 ng of p24), and 24 h later cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 7% glycerol during 15 min at room temperature. Then the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used to measure luciferase activity using an Autolumat LB 9510 (Berthold, Bad Wild-bad, Germany) following the instructions of the luciferase assay kit (Promega). The results are represented as the percentage of activation (considering the infected and untreated cells as 100% activation) or RLU. Results represent mean ± S.D. of four different experiments. Isolation and Activation of Peripheral Mononuclear Cells—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy adult volunteer donors were isolated by centrifugation of venous blood on Ficoll-Hypaque® density gradients (Amersham Biosciences). Cells (2.5 × 106/ml) were treated with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (1 μg/ml) for 72 h and then collected and used for recombinant virus (VSV-pseudotyped pNL4-3.Luc.R–E–) infection assays. Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24 h post-transfection, cells were pretreated with imperatorin for 30 min and treated or not with PMA for 12 h. The cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in 25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 7% glycerol for 15 min at room temperature in a horizontal shaker. Then the lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatant was used to measure luciferase activity using an Autolumat LB 9510 (Berthold) following the instructions of the luciferase assay kit (Promega). Results are represented as RLU or -fold induction over untreated control. Results represent mean ± S.D. of four different experiments. Isolation of Nuclear Extracts and Mobility Shift Assays—HeLa cells (106/ml) were pretreated with imperatorin at the indicated doses for 1 h and then were stimulated or not with PMA (50 ng/ml) for 6 h. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, and proteins from nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (47Sancho R. Calzado M.A. Di Marzo V. Appendino G. Muñoz E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the consensus site for Sp1, 5′-ATT CGA TCG GGG CGG GGC GAG C-3′ (Promega), was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The binding reaction mixture contained 15 μg of total extracts, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 70 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4% Ficoll, and 100,000 cpm end-labeled DNA fragments in a total volume of 20 μl. When indicated, 0.5 μl of rabbit anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or preimmune serum was added to the standard reaction before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. For cold competition, a 100-fold excess of the double-stranded oligonucleotide competitor was added to the binding reaction. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was electrophoresed through a native 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 89 mm Tris base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA. Gels were pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 225 V and then for 2 h after loading the samples. These gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C. For the Tat-TAR binding assay, RNA probe containing the 5′ bulge of TAR (48Hamy F. Felder E.R. Heizmann G. Lazdins J. Aboul-ela F. Varani G. Karn J. Klimkait T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Western Blot—HeLa cells (106/5 ml) were treated with imperatorin at the indicated doses for 12 h. Cells were then washed with PBS, and proteins were extracted from cells in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 0.15 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaFl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg of proteins were boiled in Laemmli buffer and electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.5 A at 100 V; 4 °C) for 1 h. The blots were blocked in TBS solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C, and immunodetection of cyclin D1 was carried out with monoclonal antibody α-CycD1 (Sigma) and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitative PCR Analysis—Reverse transcriptase products were detected as described previously (49Francois F. Klotman M.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2539-2549Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly HeLa cells were infected with VSV-pseudotyped recombinant virus (200 ng of p24 inoculum) for 24 h as indicated, and total DNA was extracted with the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and quantified by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Each PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl PCR mixture containing DNA (50 ng), 1× PCR buffer, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, a 0.2 μm concentration of each primer, and 2.5 units of recombinant Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The mixtures were amplified in a MultiGene cycler IR system (Labnet, Woodbridge, NJ) for an initial 2 min denaturation step at 91 °C and then 35 cycles consisting of 1 min at 91 °C, 2 min at 65 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and a final extension step of 7 min. The following primers were used to amplify short retrotranscription product (amplicon size, 140 bp): R/U5 (forward), 5′-GGC TAA CTA GGG AAC CCA CTG-3′; R/U5 (reverse), 5′-CTG CTA GAG ATT TTC CAC ACT GAC-3′. The following primer was used to amplify long retrotranscription product (amplicon size, 200 bp): R/U5 (forward), LTR/gag (reverse), 5′-CCT GCC TCG AGA GAG CTG CTC TGG-3′. As a control, genomic DNA was subjected to β-actin amplification, and PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% (w/v) agarose gel. Analysis of HIV-1 Integrated DNA by Nested Alu-PCR Assay— Genomic DNA from HeLa VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1-infected cells and HeLa control cells was extracted by using the QIAamp DNA minikit (Qiagen GmbH) and quantified by UV spectrophotometry at 260 nm. The detection of HIV-1-LTR integrated into the cell genome was performed as described before (50Van Maele B. De Rijck J. De Clercq E. Debyser Z. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4685-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The first PCR was carried out by using primers LA1, from conserved sequences of HIV-1-LTR, and LA2, from conserved human Alu sequences. Sequences of the primers are as follows: LA1, 5′-TGTGTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGT-3′ (forward); and LA2, 5′-TGCTGGGAT TACAG GCGTGAG-3′ (reverse). Each PCR amplification was performed in a 50-μl PCR mixture containing 0.5 μg of total DNA; 2 mm MgSO4 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA); a 300 μm concentration of each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Amersham Biosciences); 20 pmol of primers LA1 and LA2; 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer (Applied Biosystems); and 1.25 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems). Amplifications were carried out into thin walled reaction tubes (Sorenson BioScience, Salt Lake City, UT) in a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystems). Samples were subjected to an initial cycle of 94 °C for 10 min. Cycling conditions of the PCR were 50 cycles: 94 °C for 45 s, 53 °C for 1.5 min, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final incubation of 72 °C for 10 min. The second PCR (LTR-nested) was performed by using LTR internal primers: NL1 5′-GTGCCCGTCTGTTGTGTGACT-3′ (forward) and NL2 5′-CCGAGTCCTGCGT CGAGAGA-3′ (reverse) (amplicon size, 142 bp). A 3-μl aliquot from the first PCR amplification was added to a final volume of 50 μlof the nested PCR mixture. It contained 2 mm MgCl2; a 200 μm concentration of each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; 20 pmol of primers NL1 and NL2; and 1.0 unit of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. Before PCR, samples were heated to 95 °C for 10 min. Cycling conditions were 40 cycles: 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 1.5 min, 68 °C for 4 min, and a final incubation of 68 °C for 10 min. As a control, genomic DNA was subjected to β-actin amplification and used to normalize the nested PCR products, which were electrophoresed on a 3% (w/v) agarose gel. The bands were quantified by densitometry using a Versadoc 3000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). As a negative control DNA not subjected to the first round of PCR was also amplified by using the second PCR primers. Cell Cycle Analysis and Cytotoxicity Assays—The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry. Briefly cells were collected after treatments, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with ethanol (70%, for 24 h at 4 °C). Then t"

Here we have investigated how mTOR regulates ASK1 signaling using p53-mutant rhabdomyosarcoma cells. In Rh30 cells, ASK1 was found to physically interact with protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), previously identified as a negative regulator of ASK1. Rapamycin did not affect either protein level of PP5 or association of PP5 with ASK1. Instead, rapamycin caused rapid dissociation of the PP2A-B″ regulatory subunit (PR72) from the PP5-ASK1 complex, which was associated with reduced phosphatase activity of PP5. This effect was dependent on expression of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Down-regulation of PP5 activity by rapamycin coordinately activated ASK1, leading to elevated phosphorylation of c-Jun. Amino acid deprivation, which like rapamycin inhibits mTOR signaling, also inhibited PP5 activity, caused rapid dissociation of PR72, and activated ASK1 signaling. Overexpression of PP5, but not the PP2A catalytic subunit, blocked rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun, and protected cells from rapamycin-induced apoptosis. The results suggest that PP5 is downstream of mTOR, and positively regulated by the mTOR pathway. The findings suggest that in the absence of serum factors, mTOR signaling suppresses apoptosis through positive regulation of PP5 activity and suppression of cellular stress.

Rapamycin first forms a complex with a 12 kDa cytosolic protein designated FK-506-binding protein 12 (FKBP-12) and this complex binds mTOR and inhibits its function. Subsequently, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) becomes hypophosphorylated and associates with eIF4E (15Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H.

This association prevents binding of eIF4E to eIF4G and formation of eIF4F initiation complex, thereby inhibiting cap-dependent translation of mRNA. Inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin also directly or indirectly inactivates ribosomal p70S6 kinase (S6K1), thereby blocking translation of mRNA species containing 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOP) (17Dennis P.B. Pullen N. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6242-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 18Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, the requirement for S6K1 activity in translation of TOP containing mRNAs has been recently challenged. Importantly, complete inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin had only a slight repressive effect on translation of TOP mRNAs leading to the conclusion that regulation by growth factors and mitogens is primarily through the PI3K pathway with a minor role for mTOR in regulation of TOP mRNA translation (19Tang H. Hornstein E. Stolovich M. Levy G. Livingstone M. Templeton D. Avruch J. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8671-8683Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 20Stolovich M. Tang H. Hornstein E.

In many cell lines, exposure to rapamycin reduces overall protein synthesis only ∼15–20% but results in a specific G1 accumulation. We previously found that proliferation of human rhabdomyosarcoma cells was inhibited by low concentrations of rapamycin (21Dilling M.B. Dias P. Shapiro D.N. Germain G.S. Johnson R.K. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 903-907PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Liu L.N. Danks M.K. Shikata T. Sekulic A. Abraham R.T. Lawrence Jr, J.C. Houghton P.J. Mol.

Under serum-free culture conditions rapamycin treatment induces apoptosis in these and other cells lacking functional p53 (12Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar, 13Huang S. Liu L.N. Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3373-3381PubMed Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of p53 or p21Cip1 protects cells from apoptosis (13Huang S. Liu L.N. Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3373-3381PubMed Google Scholar). Rapamycin inhibition of mTOR induces a cellular stress response characterized by rapid and sustained activation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) signaling in p53-mutant cells. In contrast only transient activation of ASK1 signaling occurs in cells expressing functional p53/p21Cip1 (14Huang S. Shu L. Dilling M.B. Easton J. Harwood F.C. Ichijo H. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanism by which inhibition of mTOR causes activation of ASK1 signaling. Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5, also named PPT) is a novel member of Ser/Thr phosphatase family, which also includes PP1, PP2A, PP2B (also termed PP3 or calcineurin A), PP2C, PP4 (also termed PPX), PP6 (also named PPV in Drosophila, or Sit4 in yeast), and PP7 (reviewed in Ref. 23Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PP5 differs from the other Ser/Thr phosphatases in that it uniquely contains three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs at its N terminus (24Chen M.X. McPartlin A.E. Brown L. Chen Y.H. Barker H.M.

Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Removal of the TPR domains by limited proteolysis results in a substantial increase in phosphatase activity suggesting that the TPR domains also function as autoinhibitory domains (27Chen M.X.

Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), and other protein phosphatase subunits such as PP2A-A and -B subunits (40Lubert E.J. Hong Y. Sarge K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38582-38587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As in yeast, mTOR appears to regulate several protein phosphatases through binding to the Ig receptor-binding protein α4, the mammalian homologue of yeast Tap42. Association of α4 with PP2A, PP4, and PP6 has been linked to rapamycin sensitivity (41Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10624-10629Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 42Inui S. Sanjo H. Maeda K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 1998; 92: 539-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although it is considered that PP2A is negatively regulated by mTOR (18Peterson R.T. Desai B.N. Hardwick J.S. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4438-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 41Murata K. Wu J. Brautigan D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), this remains controversial. In yeast Tap42 may redirect PP2A activity (61Di Como C.J. Arndt K.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1904-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Very recent results in yeast indicate that Tap42 can both inhibit and activate protein phosphatases (47Duvel K. Santhanam A. Garrett S. Schneper L. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1467-1478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting even greater complexity of Tor signaling. At this time it is unknown whether the mTOR pathway regulates PP5. As in yeast, contradictory information on the consequences of α4 dissociation from PP2A or PP6 has been reported. For instance, rapamycin treatment inhibits cell proliferation by decreasing PP2A activity through dissociating α4 from PP2A catalytic subunit (42Inui S. Sanjo H. Maeda K. Yamamoto H. Miyamoto E. Sakaguchi N. Blood. 1998; 92: 539-546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other studies (45Chen J. Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hanada M. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, PP5 is the only protein phosphatase that has so far been identified to physically interact with, and negatively regulate ASK1 (39Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Here we show that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin or amino acid deprivation causes rapid dissociation of PP2A-B″ subunit (designated PR72) from PP5, that is associated with decreased phosphatase activity of PP5, and concurrently activating ASK1. Furthermore, down-regulation of PP5 activity by inhibition of mTOR is dependent on expression of 4E-BP1. Our findings suggest that PP5 is downstream in the mTOR pathway, is positively regulated by mTOR and that mTOR regulates ASK1 activity via PP5. Cell Lines and Growth Conditions—Human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line Rh30 that expresses a mutant p53 (Arg273 → Cys), and Rh30/mTOR-rr expressing a rapamycin-resistant mutant mTOR (Ser2035 → Ile) (12Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in antibiotic-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37° and 5% CO2. For experiments where cells were deprived of serum overnight, cell monolayers were washed with RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm l-glutamine, and incubated in the same medium. For prolonged serum-free conditions, Rh30 cells were cultured in modified N2E medium (MN2E; DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1 μg/ml human transferrin, 30 nm sodium selenate, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 30 nm vitamin E phosphate, 50 μm ethanolamine, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). For amino acid deprivation, cells were cultured in a specific RPMI 1640 medium (R-7130, without l-glutamine, l-leucine, l-lysine, and l-methionine) (Sigma). Plasmids and Transfection of Cells—Rh30 cells (5 × 105 cells) in 6-well plates were transfected with plasmid expression vectors using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as directed by the manufacturer. Plasmids encoding N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type rat PP2Aα catalytic subunit (a gift from Dr. Hitoshi Nakagama, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan) and human PP5 were as described previously (39Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Wild-type 4E-BP1 (pcDNA3-PHAS-I) was from Robert T. Abraham (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). After transfection for 48 h, cells were transferred to 100-mm dishes and cultured for 2 weeks at 37°, 5% CO2 in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml geneticin (G418 sulfate; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Drug-resistant cells were cloned and expanded in growth medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). Clones were screened by Western blot analysis for expression of the appropriate protein. 4E-BP1 was probed with an antibody to 4E-BP1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), and FLAG-PP2Aα catalytic subunit and FLAG-PP5 were detected with an antibody to FLAG (M2, Sigma). A short hairpin-activated gene silencing (SHAG) strategy was used for siRNA to down-regulate 4E-BP1, as described previously (14Huang S. Shu L. Dilling M.B. Easton J. Harwood F.C. Ichijo H. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To suppress 4E-BP1 expression Rh30 cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid (piNEO-4E-BP1 or control piNEO) using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 per the manufacturer's instructions. Three days post-transfection the cells were replated in a 10-cm dish with 10% fetal bovine serum/RPMI 1640 medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 for selection. Ten days after initial selection the piNEO and piNEO-4E-BP1 cells were analyzed for expression of 4E-BP1 protein by Western blot. Empty vector piNEO did not affect 4E-BP1 expression, whereas piNEO-4E-BP1 reduced 4E-BP1 expression by about 80%. Both piNEO and piNEO-4E-BP1 cells were expanded and used for experiments. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were briefly washed with cold PBS. On ice, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X 100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mixture (1:1000, Sigma)) for direct Western blot analysis and in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for immunoprecipitation. Lysates were sonicated for 10 s and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (Pierce). Immune complexes were immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cleared cell lysate with corresponding antibody and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and washed four times with the lysis buffer. For Western blot analysis, equivalent amounts of protein were separated on 7.5–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk to block nonspecific binding and were incubated with primary antibodies, then with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. We used primary antibodies to phospho-c-Jun (Ser63) and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4E-BP1, S6K1 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), α4 protein (a gift from D. Brautigan, University of Virginia and Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), FLAG (M2, Sigma), mTOR (58Zhang X. Shu L. Hosoi H. Murti K.G. Houghton P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28127-28134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), PP2Ac, and PP5 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), PP2A-A and -B subunits (Upstate Biotechnology), and ASK1 (48Ichijo H.

Immunoreactive bands were visualized by using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). To check the amount of protein loaded, the immunoblots were treated with stripping solution (62.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.7, containing 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Pierce). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were briefly washed with cold PBS, and disrupted in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), followed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to ASK1 (48Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) and protein A/G-agarose. The kinase activity of ASK1 in the immunocomplexes was analyzed using recombinant GST-MKK6 as a substrate, as described previously (39Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). After detection of phosphorylation of GST-MKK6, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were immunoblotted with ASK1 antibody. In Vitro Phosphatase Assay—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, 1:1000). PP2Ac or PP5 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to PP2A catalytic subunit (rabbit polyclonal, Upstate Biotechnology) or PP5 (mouse monoclonal), respectively, and protein A/G-agarose. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with the above lysis buffer, and twice with the phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2). The phosphatase activity of immunoprecipitated PP2A or PP5 was assayed with a Ser/Thr Phosphatase Assay kit 1 using KRpTIRR as the substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's instructions. Growth Inhibition Assay—Cells were seeded on 6-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) in triplicate. Rapamycin (0–10,000 ng/ml) was added the next day. After incubation for 7 days, cells were enumerated by counting the nuclei as described previously (21Dilling M.B. Dias P. Shapiro D.N. Germain G.S. Johnson R.K. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 903-907PubMed Google Scholar). FACS Analysis of Apoptosis—Cells (1.7 × 106 per 162-cm2 flask) were grown overnight in MN2E. Rapamycin (100 ng/ml) was added the next day, and cells were exposed for up to 6 days. Parallel control cells were not treated with rapamycin. Cells were treated with trypsin, washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of binding buffer (Clontech Laboratories), and incubated with 10 μl annexin V-FITC (final concentration, 1 μg/ml; Clontech Laboratories) and 500 ng propidium iodide (final volume, 410 μl). Cells were incubated at room temperature without light for 10 min before flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur) (12Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N. Shu L. Ashmun R.A. Germain G.S. Abraham R.T. Houghton P.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). Rapamycin Inhibits PP5 Activity in an mTOR-dependent Manner—We previously found that under conditions of serum-free growth rapamycin induced apoptosis of p53-mutant/null cells. Although detection of apoptosis was relatively delayed, early events were characterized by rapid and sustained activation of the ASK1 signaling pathway (12Hosoi H. Dilling M.B. Shikata T. Liu L.N.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rapamycin did not affect the level of ASK1, but increased the kinase activity of ASK1 (14Huang S. Shu L. Dilling M.B. Easton J. Harwood F.C. Ichijo H. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Recently, PP5 has been shown to interact with ASK1 and identified as a negative regulator of ASK1 in HeLa cells (39Morita K. Saitoh M. Tobiume K. Matsuura H. Enomoto S. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6028-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Activation of ASK1 signaling could be attributed to either down-regulation of PP5 protein level, decreased association of PP5 with ASK1, or decreased phosphatase activity of PP5. To answer these questions, serum-starved Rh30 cells with mutant p53 (Arg273 → Cys) were exposed to rapamycin (100 ng/ml) for up to 24 h, followed by either direct Western blot with antibodies to ASK1, PP5, and β-tubulin (loading control), or immunoprecipitation with antibodies to PP5, and then immunoblotting with antibodies to ASK1 and PP5, respectively, or in vitro phosphatase assay for PP5. As seen previously (14Huang S. Shu L. Dilling M.B. Easton J. Harwood F.C. Ichijo H. Houghton P.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1491-1501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), rapamycin did increase the kinase activity"
https://openalex.org/W1981102664,"DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) generates transient DNA single-strand breaks via the formation of cleavage complexes in which the enzyme is linked to the 3′-phosphate of the cleavage strand. The anticancer drug camptothecin (CPT) poisons Top1 by trapping cleavage complexes, thereby inducing Top1-linked single-strand breaks. Such DNA lesions are converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) upon collision with replication forks, implying that DSB repair pathways could be involved in the processing/repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. Here we report that Top1-mediated DNA damage is repaired primarily by homologous recombination, a major pathway of DSB repair. Unexpectedly, however, we found that nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), another DSB repair pathway, has no positive role in the relevant repair; notably, DT40 cell mutants lacking either of the NHEJ factors (namely, Ku70, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit, and DNA ligase IV) were resistant to killing by CPT. In addition, we showed that the absence of NHEJ alleviates the requirement of homologous recombination in the repair of CPT-induced DNA damage. Our results indicate that NHEJ can be a cytotoxic pathway in the presence of CPT, shedding new light on the molecular mechanisms for the formation and repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage in vertebrates. Thus, our data have significant implications for cancer chemotherapy involving Top1 inhibitors.

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; CPT, camptothecin; HR, homologous recombination; NHEJ, nonhomologous end joining; SSB, DNA single strand break; Top1/2, DNA topoisomerase I/II; VP-16, demethylepipodophyllotoxin ethylidene-β-d-glucoside (etoposide); DNA-PKcs, DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit. can be caused by a variety of exogenous and endogenous agents, posing a major threat to genome integrity.

The HR reaction requires a wide variety of proteins including Rad51, Rad52, and Rad54 (2Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), whereas NHEJ relies on Ku (a heterodimer of Ku70 and Ku86), DNA-PKcs, Artemis, Xrcc4, and DNA ligase IV (the LIG4 gene product) (3Critchlow S.E.

The requirement for DNA ligase IV in this pathway is exclusive as other DNA ligases (I and III) are unable to substitute for the ligase function (7Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K.

In accordance with the essential roles of HR and NHEJ in DSB repair, cells deficient in HR or NHEJ have been shown to be highly sensitive to ionizing radiation (7Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S.

These results clearly indicate that HR and NHEJ contribute equally, and independently, to the repair of radiation-induced DSBs. Perturbation of fundamental cellular processes such as DNA replication or the action of DNA topoisomerases often causes DSBs. DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous nuclear enzymes that participate in many aspects of DNA metabolisms, including DNA replication, transcription, and chromosome condensation/segregation (16Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) alters the topology of DNA through a transient DSB and subsequent religation of the DSB (16Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the enzyme by Top2 inhibitors, such as VP-16 or ICRF-193, has been shown to generate DSBs (17Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 18Nitiss J.L. Beck W.T. Eur. J.

Res. 2003; 530: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Top2-mediated DNA damage is predominantly repaired by the NHEJ pathway as evidenced by the observations that NHEJ mutants (LIG4–/– and KU70–/– cells) are extremely sensitive to Top2 inhibitors compared with wild-type or RAD54–/– cells (21Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the absence of Rad54 alleviated the hypersensitivity of KU70–/– cells, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of Top2 inhibitors is enhanced by HR (21Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Helleday and co-workers (22Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 23Lundin C. Erixon K. Arnaudeau C. Schultz N. Jenssen D. Meuth M. Helleday T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5869-5878Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) have reported that HR plays a more prominent role in the repair of replication fork-associated DNA damage than does NHEJ. The importance of repair by HR in response to replication inhibition has also been suggested by Lopes and coworkers (24Saintigny Y. Delacôte F. Varès G. Petitot F. Lambert S. Averbeck D. Lopez B.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3861-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Thus, it is evident that HR and NHEJ operate very differently depending on the nature of DNA damage. In multicellular organisms, DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is much more abundant than Top2 and is indispensable for embryonic development (25Lee M.P. Brown S.D. Chen A. Hsieh T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6656-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 26Morham S.G. Kluckman K.D. Voulomanos N. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6804-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In contrast to Top2 that relies on a transient DSB, Top1 generates a transient DNA single-strand break (SSB) with a free 5′-hydroxyl and a Top1-linked 3′-phosphate (16Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar, 17Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). Such an intermediate, referred to as a Top1 cleavage (or cleavable) complex, is normally short lived as the transient SSB is subsequently religated. Top1 has been shown to be the target of a number of anticancer agents, including camptothecin (CPT) (17Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar). These agents, referred to as Top1 poisons, selectively trap Top1 cleavage complexes by inhibiting the religation step, thereby inducing Top1-linked SSBs (17Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 351-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (1920) Google Scholar, 27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly similar Top1 poisoning can be caused by a variety of endogenous and exogenous DNA lesions, including base modifications, mismatches, and abasic sites (27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the processing/repair of spontaneous (drug-independent) Top1 cleavage complexes is important for cell growth given the abundance of Top1 proteins in the cell. Recent work by Vance and Wilson (28Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13669-13674Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) supports this notion. The repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage is probably an important determinant for the cellular responses to Top1 poisons and for the selectivity of these agents for cancer cells. Despite the biological and clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms for the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage remain largely unknown. This is partly because the repair may involve multiple pathways possibly in combination (27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The replication-dependent cytotoxic DNA lesions, which arise from collisions between replication forks and Top1 cleavage complexes, involve DSBs and Top1 covalent complexes (30Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C.

The generation of DSBs during the processing of Top1 cleavage complexes implies that DSB repair may play a role in the relevant repair. Indeed, in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HR plays a pivotal role in Top1 damage repair: cells deficient in HR, such as rad52 mutants, are extremely sensitive to CPT (28Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13669-13674Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 35Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7501-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). CPT sensitivity of NHEJ-deficient yeast cells is essentially the same as that of wild-type cells (28Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13669-13674Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In vertebrate cells, several studies have shown that cells deficient in either HR or NHEJ are more CPT-sensitive than their respective controls (parental cell lines or corrected cells), and HR is likely more important than NHEJ (22Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Caldecott K. Jeggo P. Mutat.

Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, because of the nonisogenic systems used in these studies, the respective contribution of HR and NHEJ in Top1 damage repair remains obscure. In this study, we performed genetic analyses using the DT40 cell line to investigate the roles of HR and NHEJ in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. We showed that HR is indeed important for Top1 damage repair. Strikingly we found that all NHEJ mutants (KU70–/–, DNA-PKcs–/–/–, and LIG4–/– cells) are resistant to killing by CPT compared with wild-type cells. Furthermore the absence of NHEJ alleviated the requirement of HR in the repair of CPT-induced DNA damage. Our results indicate that NHEJ can be cytotoxic in the presence of Top1 poisons and that HR and NHEJ have opposing roles in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. We suggest a model for the negative role of NHEJ in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. Cell Culture and Clonogenic Assays—DT40 mutant cell lines used in this study (LIG4–/– cells, KU70–/– cells, DNA-PKcs–/–/– cells, RAD54–/– cells, and RAD54–/–/KU70–/– cells) have been created by gene targeting and extensively characterized in earlier studies (8Adachi N.

Note that the chicken DNA-PKcs gene (Prkdc) lies on chromosome 2, which is trisomic in DT40 cells (14Fukushima T. Takata M. Morrison C. Araki R. Fujimori A. Abe M. Tatsumi K. Jasin M. Dhar P.K. Sonoda E. Chiba T. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44413-44418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All the DT40 cell lines were cultured in a 5% CO2 incubator at 39 °C in ES medium (Nissui Seiyaku, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% chicken serum. Clonogenic survival assays were performed as described previously (8Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 102–105 cells/dish into 60-mm bacterial dishes containing 4 ml of soft agarose medium (ES medium containing 0.12% agarose, 20% fetal bovine serum, and 2% chicken serum) with various drug concentrations. The cells were grown for 7–11 days, and the resulting visible colonies were counted. The percentage of survival was determined by comparing the number of surviving colonies to untreated controls. For each assay, at least three independent experiments were performed. Camptothecin, purchased from Sigma, was dissolved in Me2SO and stored frozen in aliquots at –20 °C. Relaxation Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from DT40 cells as described previously (40Adachi N. Nomoto M. Kohno K. Koyama H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 245: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Relaxation assays were performed in the absence of ATP by using supercoiled plasmid DNA as a substrate. Briefly, 0.1–1 μg of nuclear extracts were added to 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1–2 μg of pBruescript II SK(–). After incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding SDS to 0.5%. The samples were then electrophoresed in a 0.9% agarose gel, and the DNA was stained with ethidium bromide, visualized by illumination with UV light, and photographed. In Vivo Complex of Topoisomerase Bioassays—Top1 cleavage complexes formed in vivo were measured by an antibody-based in vivo complex of topoisomerase bioassay as described previously (41Muller M.T. Mehta V.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were treated with CPT for 1 h at 39 °C in serum-free medium. The cells were directly lysed with 1% Sarkosyl, and the viscous lysate was overlaid onto a preformed CsCl step gradient. After centrifugation at 20 °C in a Beckman SW55 rotor at 31,000 rpm for 20–24 h, gradients were fractionated from the bottom. DNA peaks were located using A260 determinations on each fraction. Each fraction (50 μl) was applied to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C extra, Amersham Biosciences) using a slot blot device. The membrane was incubated with anti-human Top1 antibody (Scl-70) obtained from TopoGEN, Inc. (Columbus, OH) followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A. (Note that Scl-70 is cross-reactive with chicken Top1 (43Heck M.M. Hittelman W.N. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1086-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar).) Signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instruction. NHEJ-deficient DT40 Cells Are Resistant to Killing by CPT—By clonogenic assays, we examined the sensitivity of various DT40 cell lines to the Top1 poison CPT. As shown in Fig. 1A, wild-type cells were not so sensitive to CPT at low doses (∼30 nm). At higher doses (≥90 nm), however, they were very sensitive, and the size of surviving colonies was considerably small (data not shown). In sharp contrast, LIG4–/– cells (8Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) were resistant to killing by CPT compared with wild-type cells. Remarkably, even at 90 nm, the survival of the mutant was not significantly affected, and the colonies were as large as those formed in the absence of the drug (data not shown). Ectopic expression of a LIG4 transgene in LIG4–/– cells sensitized the cells to the drug (Fig. 1B), indicating that the presence of DNA ligase IV is actually cytotoxic when CPT is present. Note that the transgene expression does rescue the hypersensitivity of LIG4–/– cells to x-rays (8Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Similar to the LIG4–/– cells, KU70–/– cells (9Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) and DNA-PKcs–/–/– cells (14Fukushima T. Takata M. Morrison C. Araki R. Fujimori A. Abe M. Tatsumi K. Jasin M. Dhar P.K. Sonoda E. Chiba T. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44413-44418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) showed an increased CPT resistance compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1A). These results strongly suggest that cells defective in NHEJ are resistant to killing by CPT. To further confirm the above results, we compared growth curves of these cell lines in the presence of CPT. In the absence of the drug, NHEJ-deficient cells proliferated at a slightly lower rate than wild-type cells (Fig. 2A), consistent with previous observations (8Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Sonoda E. Chiba T. Takeda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44413-44418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the presence of high doses of CPT (60 or 100 nm), wild-type cells proliferated very poorly (Fig. 2, B, C, and D). In marked contrast, all the NHEJ mutants were able to grow under these conditions even though the growth rate was dose-dependently reduced (Fig. 2, B, C, and D). Collectively, the data clearly indicate that DT40 NHEJ mutants are resistant to killing by CPT. NHEJ Mutants Are Not Resistant to Inhibition of DNA Replication—Because CPT is known to inhibit DNA replication (22Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 30Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1095-1102PubMed Google Scholar, 31Trumberg D. Pilon A.A. Smith M. Hickey R. Malkas L. Pommier Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), the observed CPT tolerance of NHEJ mutants could be attributable to an increased resistance to replication inhibition. To test this possibility, we examined the impact of DNA replication inhibitors, hydroxyurea and thymidine, on cell growth. As shown, the NHEJ mutants did not exhibit increased resistance to hydroxyurea (Fig. 3, A and B) or thymidine (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that the increased resistance of NHEJ mutants is specific to Top1 poisoning but not global inhibition of DNA replication. Top1 Activity Is Not Altered in NHEJ Mutants—A large body of evidence indicates that a reduction in Top1 activity confers resistance to Top1 poisons (26Morham S.G. Kluckman K.D. Voulomanos N. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6804-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 44Kijama T. Kubota N. Nishio K. Anticancer Res. 1994; 14: 799-803PubMed Google Scholar, 45Sorenson M. Sehested M. Jensen P.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 73: 399-404Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We therefore prepared nuclear extracts from the wild-type and mutant cell lines and examined the Top1 activity by ATP-independent relaxation assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, relaxation activity of Top1 from NHEJ mutants was essentially the same as that from wild-type cells. This was further confirmed by a time course experiment with LIG4–/– cells and those transfected with the LIG4 transgene (Fig. 4B). We also compared the level of Top1 expression by immunoblot analysis and found no significant difference between wild-type and NHEJ-deficient cells (data not shown). These results suggest that neither the amount of Top1 nor its activity is altered in the NHEJ mutants. To further verify this, we next used an antibody-based in vivo complex of topoisomerase bioassay, which allows detection of covalent Top1-DNA complexes in cells (41Muller M.T. Mehta V.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3661-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Subramanian D. Furbee C.S. Muller M.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 95: 137-147PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C, a significant amount of Top1-DNA complexes was indeed trapped in CPT-treated LIG4–/– cells, which was comparable to that of CPT-treated wild-type cells. Very similar results were obtained with KU70–/– and DNA-PKcs–/–/– cells (data not shown). In the absence of CPT, such Top1-DNA complexes were barely detectable in either cell line (data not shown). (We note that under our experimental conditions, a slightly (but reproducibly) larger amount of Top1-DNA complexes was detected in the NHEJ mutants, although the reason for this increase is currently unclear.) Most importantly, the pattern of CPT-treated LIG4–/– cells was indistinguishable from those corrected with the LIG4 transgene (Fig. 4C), indicating that the absence of DNA ligase IV does not affect the formation of covalent Top1-DNA complexes in vivo. Taken together, the results clearly show that the NHEJ mutants possess normal Top1 activity. Thus, the CPT resistance of NHEJ mutants is not accounted for by a decrease in cellular Top1 activity. HR Is Involved in the Repair of Top1-mediated DNA Damage—To investigate the role of HR in the repair of Top1 poison-induced DNA damage, we examined the sensitivity to CPT of RAD54–/– cells (9Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar, 39Bezzubova O. Silbergleit A. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. Buerstedde J.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 185-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We found that the RAD54–/– cells were more sensitive than wild-type cells (Fig. 5). It is worth mentioning that even at low doses of CPT (e.g. 30 nm), the size of RAD54–/– colonies was considerably small (data not shown). These results thus indicate that HR plays an important role in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. Finally, we examined the sensitivity of a RAD54–/–/KU70–/– double mutant, which is defective in both HR and NHEJ and extremely hypersensitive to ionizing radiation (9Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M. Utsumi H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Shinohara A. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5497-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of HR in Top1 damage repair, RAD54–/–/KU70–/– cells were more CPT-sensitive than KU70–/– cells (Fig. 5). Intriguingly, however, the double mutant was more resistant to the drug than RAD54–/– cells and, less pronouncedly, than wild-type cells. This suggests that NHEJ deficiency does confer CPT resistance even in cells defective for HR. These findings were further confirmed by comparing growth curves of the mutant cell lines; in the presence of CPT (60 or 100 nm), RAD54–/–/KU70–/– cells proliferated more slowly than NHEJ-deficient cells, but the growth was indeed better than that of wild-type cells (data not shown). In vertebrate cells, the molecular mechanisms for the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the respective roles of HR and NHEJ in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage induced by the anticancer drug CPT. Our data provide evidence that HR, but not NHEJ, is important for Top1 damage repair in vertebrate cells. Most importantly, we found that DT40 cells deficient in NHEJ are resistant to killing by CPT. The CPT tolerance was observed even in the absence of a functional repair pathway (HR), indicating that the loss of NHEJ alleviates the HR requirement in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage. It should be noted that the observed CPT resistance of NHEJ mutants is not attributable to changes in cellular Top1 activity or to resistance to replication inhibition. The importance of HR in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage has been suggested (22Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Caldecott K. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Hinz J.M. Helleday T. Meuth M. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 46Kraakman-van der Zwet M. Overkamp W.J. Friedl A.A. Klein B. Verhaegh G.W. Jaspers N.G. Midro A.T.

Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1781-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Clearly, our findings with RAD54–/– cells support this notion. More importantly, however, our current results with RAD54–/–/KU70–/– cells indicate that NHEJ deficiency does confer CPT resistance in cells defective for HR. Of particular interest is that the RAD54–/–/KU70–/– double mutant was more resistant to CPT than wild-type cells (Fig. 5). This suggests that although HR plays an important role in Top1 damage repair, the role is negligible in cells lacking functional NHEJ. These results imply that HR may not be the sole pathway that repairs Top1-mediated DNA damage, compatible with recent evidence that multiple pathways are involved in the repair of Top1-mediated DNA damage (27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The idea that efficient alternative pathways (other than HR) may work to repair Top1-mediated DNA damage contrasts with the situation in yeast where HR plays essential roles in Top1 damage repair (28Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13669-13674Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); specifically, several redundant pathways are involved in the initial processing of Top1 damage, but all the pathways eventually rely on HR to complete repair. Yet, even the partial contribution from HR in vertebrate Top1 damage repair would be intriguing in light of our recent finding that vertebrate Top2-mediated DNA damage (induced by Top2 inhibitors) is predominantly repaired by NHEJ, not HR (21Adachi N. Suzuki H. Iiizumi S. Koyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35897-35902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In yeast, HR is responsible for the repair of Top2-mediated DNA damage, whereas NHEJ has only a minor role (49Sabourin M. Nitiss J.L. Nitiss K.C. Tatebayashi K. Ikeda H. Osheroff N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4373-4384Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, the roles of DSB repair pathways in topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage are quite different between yeast and vertebrates. Taken together, our studies revealed that vertebrate HR and NHEJ have opposing roles in the repair of Top1- as well as Top2-mediated DNA damage. Namely, HR is involved in Top1 damage repair in which NHEJ can play a negative role; conversely, NHEJ is an essential requirement for Top2 damage repair in which HR may be cytotoxic. An increased resistance caused by NHEJ deficiency has been observed toward high doses (>6 grays) of ionizing radiation in DT40 cells; this was, however, specific to KU70–/– cells (8Adachi N. Ishino T. Ishii Y. Takeda S. Koyama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12109-12113Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C. Hashimoto M.

In the present study, an increased resistance to CPT was observed in LIG4–/– and DNA-PKcs–/–/– cells as well as KU70–/– cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of a LIG4 transgene in LIG4–/– cells sensitized the cells to CPT. These results clearly indicate that NHEJ deficiency itself confers CPT resistance. Why then does the loss of NHEJ confer CPT resistance? In other words, how can NHEJ be cytotoxic in the presence of Top1 poisons? Several explanations might address these questions. However, because NHEJ is the major DSB repair pathway and DNA ligase IV function is critical for this pathway, it would be reasonable to speculate that NHEJ unfavorably operates to join the ends of DSBs that, in order for cells to survive, must be repaired by other pathways. Joining of such DSBs by NHEJ may result in a deleterious dead end structure of some sort, eventually leading to cell death. Supportive of this idea is increasing evidence that CPT induces DSBs in vivo (22Arnaudeau C. Lundin C. Helleday T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1235-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F.

In particular, collisions of replication forks with Top1 cleavage complexes have been suggested to generate free DSBs along with irreversible Top1 covalent complexes that may also be potentially causative of DSBs (Fig. 6). Thus, the generation of DSBs during the processing of Top1 cleavage complexes would provide opportunities to use NHEJ. It is possible that similar DSBs that do not favor NHEJ-mediated repair may be generated in a replication-independent manner. For example, SSBs occurring in close proximity of Top1 cleavage complexes can directly cause DSBs (27Pourquier P. Pommier Y. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 80: 189-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that defects in NHEJ confer resistance to Top1 poisons. It will thus be interesting to examine whether certain cancer cells with acquired resistance to Top1 poisons have some defect in NHEJ possibly in combination with other genetic and/or epigenetic changes. It has been shown, however, that NHEJ has no impact on CPT sensitivity/resistance in yeast (28Vance J.R. Wilson T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13669-13674Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Additionally, earlier work has suggested that Chinese hamster ovary cell lines deficient in Ku or DNA-PKcs are slightly more CPT-sensitive than their respective controls (36Caldecott K. Jeggo P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 255: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 37Hinz J.M. Helleday T. Meuth M. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), although these mutants may have accompanied additional genetic (or epigenetic) changes that affect CPT sensitivity. Thus, we used the human pre-B cell line Nalm-6 to compare the sensitivity to CPT of wild-type and LIG4–/– cells (7Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and found that the targeted deletion of LIG4 had no impact on CPT sensitivity. 2S. So, N. Adachi, and H. Koyama, unpublished results. This finding strongly suggests that NHEJ does not play a significant role in Top1 damage repair, consistent with our current observations with DT40 cells. Hence, it is highly likely that NHEJ in general plays little or no positive role in Top1 damage repair. The result with the human cell line, however, does not support the negative role of NHEJ discussed here. The reason for apparent differences in cell lines with respect to NHEJ and CPT is currently unclear. It may be that only under certain conditions NHEJ becomes cytotoxic in the presence of Top1 poisons. Given that NHEJ processing of Top1 damage results in a lethal dead end structure (see above), it is possible that such lethal damage is not significantly repairable by any other process in DT40 cells, while a pathway(s) might exist in some cells (at least in Nalm-6) to cope with the lethal damage. Alternatively, some cells might suffer less (or no) damage induced by NHEJ and CPT, for example, by preventing the NHEJ machinery from accessing Top1 damage on the genome. Clearly, further studies are needed to fully understand the negative role of NHEJ in Top1 damage repair. Finally our findings presented here shed new light on the molecular mechanisms for the formation and repair of Top1-mediated cytotoxic DNA damage in vertebrates and have significant implications for cancer chemotherapy involving Top1 inhibitors. We thank Shunichi Takeda for generously providing us with the DT40 cell mutants. We also thank Bob Snapka for helpful suggestions and Chie Nishigaki for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2115048384,"The determination of molecular masses from barometric sedimentation profiles, a main topic in ultracentrifugal analysis, is thought to be quantitatively correct for non-interacting particles. Whereas this expectation is justified for uncharged colloids or macromolecules at low volume fractions, early ultracentrifugation studies on charged particles had already indicated that the obtained masses might be much too low. More recently, expanded sedimentation profiles have been observed for charged particles, sometimes inflated by orders of magnitude relative to the barometric prediction, which highlights a shortcoming in our understanding of centrifugation of even very dilute charged species. Theory and simulations, anticipated by various authors, now propose that strongly non-barometric sedimentation profiles might be caused by an internal macroscopic electric field that, even for non-interacting particles, significantly decreases the buoyant particle mass. The existence of this field and its intriguing consequences still lack experimental verification. Here we report ultracentrifugation experiments on charged colloidal silica spheres, showing both the existence of such a macroscopic electric field and its drastic effects on the sedimentation profiles of very dilute dispersions at low ionic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2057055928,"Poty- and picornaviruses share similar genome organizations and polyprotein processing strategies. By analogy to picornaviruses it has been proposed that the genome-linked protein VPg may serve as a primer for genome replication of potyviruses. The multifunctional VPg of potato virus A (PVA; genus Potyvirus) was found to be uridylylated by NIb, the RNA polymerase of PVA. The nucleotidylation activity of NIb is more efficient in the presence of Mn2+ than Mg2+ and does not require an RNA template. Our results suggest that the nucleotidylation reaction exhibits weak preference for UTP over the other NTPs. An NTP-binding experiment with oxidized [α-32P]UTP revealed that PVA VPg contains an NTP-binding site. Deletion of a 7-amino acid-long putative NTP-binding site from VPg reduced nucleotide-binding capacity and debilitated uridylylation reaction. These results provide evidence that VPg may play a similar role in RNA synthesis of potyviruses as it does in the case of picornaviruses.

The entire PVA genome is expressed as a polyprotein, which is subsequently processed into 10 mature proteins by three different viral proteinases (1Merits A. Rajamäki M.-L. Lindholm P.

Potyviruses resemble picornaviruses in genome organization and polyprotein processing strategy (2Sadowy E. Milner M. Hanni A.L. Adv. Virus Res. 2001; 57: 185-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genomic RNA of picornaviruses and potyviruses is covalently linked at the 5′-end to the small, virally encoded protein VPg (3Ambros V. Baltimore D. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rothberg P.G. Harris T.J.R. Nomoto A. Wimmer E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virus Res. 2001; 73: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The N-terminal VPg domain is slowly released from NIa by the proteolytic activity of the C-terminal NIa-Pro domain in the course of potyvirus infection. It is essential for replication that proteolytic processing at the suboptimal NIa internal cleavage site occurs (6Carrington J.C. Hadelman R. Dolja V.V. Restrepo-Hartwig M.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6995-7000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Potyviral VPg is a multifunctional protein (as reviewed in Ref. 2Sadowy E. Milner M. Hanni A.L. Adv. Virus Res. 2001; 57: 185-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also exposed at one end of the virion (7Puustinen P. Rajamäki M.-L. Ivanov K. Valkonen J.P.T. Mäkinen K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12703-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The size of potyviral VPg is substantially larger than that of poliovirus (PV) VPg, and they do not share any obvious sequence homology. PV VPg represents the most advanced model for understanding the role of VPg as a primer for the viral replicase. PV VPg is a small peptide containing only 22 amino acids. It is genome-linked via a bond between the hydroxyl group of a tyrosine residue and the α-phosphate group of uridylic acid. In vitro uridylylation of PV VPg catalyzed by the viral polymerase resulted in a VPg-linked poly(U) (8Paul V.A. Boom J. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Replication of picornaviruses requires cis-acting RNA elements, termed cre (9McKnight K.L. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1941-1952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In PV this small RNA hairpin structure is within the coding region of protein 2C. Its presence in the in vitro reaction mixture stimulated uridylylation as compared with a reaction with poly(A) as a template (10Paul V.A. Rieder E. Kim D.W. Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The PV cre-dependent VPg uridylylation is required only for the synthesis of new positive strands, whereas the minus strand synthesis is VPg-dependent but cre-independent (11Murray K.E. Barton D.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4739-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). VPg of tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV; genus Potyvirus) is linked to the viral RNA via Tyr-60 and TVMV carrying the mutation Tyr-60 to Ala is not able to replicate in protoplasts (12Murphy J.F. Klein P.G. Hunt A.G. Shaw J.G. Virology. 1996; 220: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Murphy J.F. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.A. Hunt A.G. Shaw J.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 511-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, substitution of the corresponding Tyr with Ala in another potyvirus, tobacco etch virus (TEV), makes it amplification-defective (14Schaad M.C. Haldeman-Cahill R. Cronin S. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7039-7048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear inclusion protein NIb is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) responsible for genome replication of potyviruses (15Hong Y. Hunt A. Virology. 1996; 226: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It contains an amino acid triplet Gly-Asp-Asp, which is universally conserved among RdRps (16Kamer G. Argos P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7269-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), and when NIb of TEV was mutated at this motif, the virus was unable to replicate (17Li X.H. Carrington J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The NIb of TEV interacts specifically with the protease part of NIa (18Li X.H. Valdez P. Olvera R.E. Carrington J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the NIb of TVMV can interact with the NIa-VPg, as shown in vitro (19Fellers J. Wan J. Hong Y. Collins G.B. Hunt A.G. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2043-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and also in vivo with the yeast two-hybrid system (20Hong Y. Levay K. Murphy J.F. Klein P.G. Shaw J.G. Hunt A.G. Virology. 1995; 214: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings have supported the view that VPg may serve as a primer for genome replication of potyviruses. However, no direct evidence to support this hypothesis is available. Here we show that the recombinant PVA VPg can be uridylylated by purified recombinant PVA NIb in an in vitro reaction and that VPg is an NTP-binding protein. Deletion of a 7-amino acid-long putative NTP-binding site from VPg led to a reduced nucleotide-binding capacity and debilitated uridylylation reaction. These results increase our understanding of the mechanisms involved in potyvirus RNA synthesis. Recombinant Protein Expression—(His)6/pQE (Qiagen) constructs for PVA VPg and NIb expressions were made as described previously (21Merits A. Guo D. Saarma M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 3123-3127Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain M15[REP4] cells. VPg was purified by using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under denaturing conditions according to standard protocol. Purified VPg proteins were refolded by a rapid dialysis procedure shown previously to recover the protein-protein binding properties of PVA proteins (22Merits A. Guo D. Järvekülg L. Saarma M. Virology. 1999; 263: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). PVA NIb was purified under native conditions according to standard protocol with the following modifications. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 0,1% Tween, and 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then lysed in a French press cell (three cycles at 10,000 pounds/square inch). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen). His-tagged proteins were washed and eluted by step changes in imidazole concentration with washing buffer B (30 mm imidazole in buffer A) and elution buffer C (500 mm imidazole in buffer A) and further dialyzed against water to remove imidazole. In Vitro Uridylylation Assay—Uridylylation was measured as the incorporation of radioactivity from [α-32P]UTP into the purified PVA VPg in an in vitro reaction. Reaction conditions were essentially as described previously (8Paul V.A. Boom J. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The reactions were performed at room temperature (RT = 22 °C) for 25 min in a final volume of 30 μl containing 0.75 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 2 μg of PVA VPg, a varying amount of NIb (0–0.3 μg), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 2 units of RNasin (Promega), and 0.5 μg of poly(A)n (n = 35–200; Amersham Biosciences) when required. Reactions were terminated with 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer or they were further purified for downstream analysis. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 12–15% gels. Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized and quantified by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager (Fuji) and Tina 2.09c software (Raytest). In Vitro Nucleotidylation Competition Assay—PVA VPg (2 μg) was in vitro uridylylated essentially as described above in the presence of one of the following cold competitor NTPs: ATP, UTP, GTP, or CTP. Several concentrations of the cold competitor were tested: 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 μm. The final reaction volume was 20 μl containing 2 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MnCl2, 2 units of RNasin (Promega), 0,1 μg of NIb, and 0.5 μg of poly(A) template (Amersham Biosciences) in half of the samples. After 25 min of incubation at RT, the reactions were terminated, and proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were subjected to autoradiography with a PhosphorImager screen, and the [α-32P]UMP incorporated into the VPg during the nucleotidylation competition reaction was quantified. Two-dimensional Analysis of Nucleotidylated VPgs—VPg proteins were uridylylated with [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence and absence of a poly(A) template in standard reactions. ZipTip C-4 columns (Millipore) were rehydrated with 50% acetonitrile in H2O and equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Uridylylated VPg samples were applied onto the C-4 column several times to separate the labeled protein from the free [α-32P]UTP. The column was washed with 50% acetonitrile in H2O, and proteins were eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid into a 20-μl volume. The eluted samples were dried by SpeedVac (Savant) and resolved into a buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 3.5% CHAPS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.5% IPG buffer, pI 6–11. Samples were then applied to Immobiline™ Dry Strip (Amersham Biosciences), pH 6–11, and subjected to isoelectric focusing with ETTAN IPGphor (Amersham Biosciences) using the following steps: rehydration for 6 h at RT and then 6 h at 20 V, 1 h at 150 V, 1 h at 300 V, and 1 h at 600V followed by applying a voltage gradient from 600 to 5000 V for 1 h and finally 3 h at 8000 V. After the first run the strip was subjected to the second dimension in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue). Strips were cut to cover the pH range 8–11 before electrophoresis in 12% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and [α-32P]UTP-labeled VPg was visualized. Tryptic Phosphopeptide Mapping—[α-32P]UMP-labeled VPg was resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Proteins on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were visualized with Ponceau S staining and autoradiography. The membrane pieces containing the labeled protein of interest were excised and saturated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 360 (Sigma) in 100 mm acetic acid (37 °C, 30 min). The protein was digested on the membrane pieces with 1 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) in 50 mm NH4HCO3 solubilized in 10% acetonitrile (37 °C, overnight). The peptides were released from the membrane pieces by several rounds of washing, then lyophilized and washed with water four times, and dissolved in 5 μl of ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.9. The peptide samples were spotted onto 20 × 20-cm thin layer chromatography cellulose plates (Merck). The first dimension electrophoresis was performed at 1200 V for 22 min in ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 8.9. The air-dried plate was subjected to separation in the second dimension by chromatography in isobutyric acid:n-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:water at 156:5:12: 8:70 (v/v). Labeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography. Identification of the Amino Acid Involved in Formation of the VPg-Nucleotide Linkage—[α-32P]UMP-labeled VPg was purified through ZipTip C-4 column (Millipore) to reduce the amount of free [α-32P]UTP according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 10 instead of 3 individual washing steps were done with 0,1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted labeled VPg proteins were dried and washed once with H2O. Protein was hydrolyzed in 200 μl of 6 m HCl (110 °C, 2 h). The hydrolyzed samples were analyzed by two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis on cellulose plates essentially as described in Ref. 7Puustinen P. Rajamäki M.-L. Ivanov K. Valkonen J.P.T. Mäkinen K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12703-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar. Phosphoamino acid standards were visualized with 2% ninhydrin, and radioactive amino acids were visualized from dried and stained cellulose plates. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were measured with a Jasco-715 spectropolarimeter using 0.1-cm path-length quartz cuvettes containing 0.2 ml of each VPg protein at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml in water. CD spectra were recorded between the wavelengths 260 to 185 nm with 0.1 nm steps, 10 nm/min scan speed, and a 4-s time constant at RT. Twenty spectra were averaged for each sample, and the background spectra without protein were subtracted. Chemical Cross-linking Experiment with Glutaraldehyde—Uridylylation reactions were initiated as described before, and after 25 min of incubation at RT different amounts of glutaraldehyde diluted in the uridylylation reaction buffer were added to the reaction mixtures. The uridylylated samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and detected by Western blot analysis with anti-VPg antibody and by autoradiography. NTP-binding Assay—[α-32P]UTP was oxidized with 0.75 mm sodium periodate in the dark in the presence of 0.5 mm HCl at RT. The surplus periodate was reduced with glycerol. Oxidized UTP was cross-linked to PVA VPg by modifying the procedures used previously (23Clertant P. Cuzin F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6300-6305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Richards O.C. Hanson J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Cross-linking mixture contained 0.02 μCi of oxidized [α-32P]UTP, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2, 3 mm sodium cyanoborohydride (NaCNBH3), and 3 μg of PVA VPg in a final volume of 30 μl. Reactions were incubated at 0 °C for 60 min. The reaction products were analyzed with SDS-PAGE without any further purification. Labeled reaction products were visualized and quantified. The RNA-independent Uridylylation of PVA VPg by PVA NIb—PVA VPg and NIb were both expressed as N-terminal hexahistidine fusions in E. coli. PVA VPg was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography in denaturing conditions and was then refolded by dialysis. We have shown previously that PVA VPg obtained by using this approach takes part in several protein-protein interactions (22Merits A. Guo D. Järvekülg L. Saarma M. Virology. 1999; 263: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and can be phosphorylated by host kinase(s) (7Puustinen P. Rajamäki M.-L. Ivanov K. Valkonen J.P.T. Mäkinen K. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 12703-12711Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Mäkinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Purification of NIb was carried out in native conditions, because this was required for the polymerase to be active in the uridylylation reaction. After the proteins were purified with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, they were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. One major band at the expected molecular mass of 25 kDa for VPg and 58 kDa for NIb was observed in the Coomassie-stained gels (data not shown). The purified PVA VPg was assayed for uridylylation in an in vitro reaction containing the purified PVA NIb and [α-32P]UTP in the presence of 5 mm MnCl2. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue with autoradiography. PVA VPg was found to be uridylylated by NIb (Fig. 1A, lane 1). No labeled protein was produced in the absence of VPg (Fig. 1A, lane 2) confirming that the band identified corresponded to labeled recombinant VPg. Omission of NIb from the reaction mixture also abolished uridylylation (Fig. 1A, lane 4) indicating that the bands on the autoradiogram did not correspond to radiolabeled UTP noncovalently bound to VPg and that the affinity-purified VPg preparation did not contain any enzymatic activity capable of uridylylating VPg. Increasing amounts of NIb in reaction mixtures led to increased uridylylation (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8). Kinetics of the uridylylation reaction remained linear for an hour at RT (data not shown). The NIb Activity Uridylylating PVA VPg Exhibits a Preference for Mn2+over Mg2+—It is well established that DNA and RNA polymerases require a divalent cation for their activity. When free Mn2+ was removed from the reaction mixture in a complex with EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio, no uridylylation was detected (Fig. 1B). As expected, the presence of a divalent metal cation was indispensable for NIb uridylylation activity. To find out which divalent cation was required for an optimal activity, Mg2+ and Mn2+ were tested; these ions are both known to function as activators of the RNA polymerases and the nucleotidylation reaction. The results showed clearly that NIb has a strong preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+ (Fig. 1C). The capacity of Mg2+ to support nucleotidylation reaction was practically 10 times lower than that of Mn2+ in an identical concentration. Other divalent metal cations were not investigated. Mn2+ can support the nucleotidylation reaction at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 15 mm MnCl2 (data not shown). Tolerance for a broad concentration range for the activating cation was earlier observed for the Mg2+-dependent DNA polymerase of the bacteriophage PRD1 and also for PV RdRp (26Caldentey J. Blanco L. Savilahti H. Bamford D.H. Salas M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Crotty S. Gohara D. Gilligan D.K. Karelsky S. Cameron C.E. Andino R. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5378-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We examined whether these two metal ions competed for a common binding site or whether the presence of both ions could influence the rate of nucleotidylation independently. A micromolar concentration of MgCl2 in the presence of a millimolar concentration of MnCl2 was capable of slightly increasing the nucleotidylation reaction (Fig. 1C), suggesting that Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions do not compete for the same site. A Comparison of the in Vitro Uridylylation Reaction in the Presence and Absence of an RNA Template—The presence of an RNA template is an absolute requirement for PV VPg uridylylation, in contrast to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (8Paul V.A. Boom J. Filippov D. Wimmer E. Nature. 1998; 393: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 28Machín A. Martin Alonso J.M. Parra M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27787-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our result suggests that under the experimental conditions used, the PVA system did not require a template. Addition of the poly(A) template did not stimulate the uridylylation reaction per se but induced the synthesis of a labeled high molecular weight product that did not migrate into the resolving gel (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 2, and 6–8). The amount of this product increased when more NIb (RdRp) was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 1A, lanes 5–8). Therefore, we concluded that the appearance of this molecule resulted from a reaction actively catalyzed by PVA NIb. The synthesis was independent of the presence of VPg indicating that this poly(A)-dependent reaction was not primed by VPg. Also, no VPg was detected by Western blot analysis at the top of the gel in this band. It is possible that the high molecular weight product is a poly(U) molecule resulting from nonspecific template-dependent polymerization reaction catalyzed by NIb. An alternative explanation for the emergence of the labeled RNA-molecule is a terminal transferase activity of NIb. The 3Dpol of PV has putatively such an activity in contrast to TVMV NIb (15Hong Y. Hunt A. Virology. 1996; 226: 146-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 29Plotch S.J. Palant O. Gluzman Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 216-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the full-length PV RNA transcript stimulates the 3Dpol-catalyzed VPg-uridylylation even more than the poly(A) molecules alone (10Paul V.A. Rieder E. Kim D.W. Boom J.H. Wimmer E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10359-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the full-length PVA transcript did not confer any stimulation for the NIb-catalyzed VPg uridylylation reaction (data not shown). On the contrary, the presence of either poly(A) or PVA RNA caused a small reduction in the yield of the uridylylated VPg (Fig. 2), which is most likely due to a less amount of NIb available for the uridylylation reaction in the presence of a competing reaction and more choice for the interaction partners. Analysis of the Uridylylated VPg Products—Free VPg, carrying more than one covalently linked UMP (VPg pUpU), has been found in PV-infected cells (30Crawford N.M. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7452-7455Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This precursor to elongation is most likely synthesized independently of the elongation reaction. Therefore, the question of how many uridylic acid molecules were linked to PVA VPg during the uridylylation reaction, both in the presence and in the absence of the RNA template, was addressed. Further extensive elongation to form VPg pUn seemed unlikely because no VPg was detected in the high molecular weight band produced in the presence of the poly(A) template (Fig. 1A). We monitored the incorporation of [α-32P]UTP with two-dimensional gels. Uridylylated VPg forms derived from the reaction mixtures with (Fig. 3A) and without RNA (Fig. 3B) were found in the autoradiograms and silver-stained gels as extended, nearly identical labeled spots, indicating that all VPg forms were uridylylated. However, separation of nonuridylylated VPg protein through a two-dimensional gel and comparison of this silver-stained pattern to uridylylated VPg proteins revealed similar patterns (data not shown), indicating some heterogeneity within the purified VPg protein sample. Additionally, VPg uridylylated with NIb was separated with SDS-PAGE and transferred to a membrane. VPg was trypsinated in the membrane, and released peptides were separated on TLE/TLC plates. As shown in TLE/TLC plate autoradiography (Fig. 4), two major peptides were detected. Therefore, it is possible that two uridylylated VPg forms were produced, although it is also possible that two different amino acids in two different peptides were uridylylated or a single amino acid contains the uridylic acid, but due to two alternative trypsin cleavage sites it is found in distinct peptides sharing part of the amino acid sequence. As a final attempt to detect the number of uridylic acids added by NIb, we performed a MALDI-TOF analysis of the trypsinated VPg samples to find peptides carrying covalently linked nucleotide added by NIb. However, the percent of the uridylylated VPg produced in in vitro reactions was low and unfortunately below the limits of MALDI-TOF (data not shown). Approximately only 0.3% of the input rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus VPg was uridylylated in an in vitro reaction similar to ours (28Machín A. Martin Alonso J.M. Parra M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27787-27792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The identity of the amino acid residue involved in the PVA VPg-Up linkage was investigated. The 32P-labeled uridylylated PVA VPg was acid-hydrolyzed. A subsequent thin layer electrophoretic amino acid analysis revealed two 32P-labeled molecules. We assume that the faster migrating molecule represents the free label, whereas the slower one migrated to the same position with the ninhydrin-stained phosphotyrosine marker (Fig. 5), suggesting that a tyrosine residue was uridylylated in the in vitro reaction. Residue Tyr-60 forms a linkage to viral RNA in TVMV VPg, as shown in analysis of in vivo labeled virus particles (13Murphy J.F. Rychlik W. Rhoads R.A. Hunt A.G. Shaw J.G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 511-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we substituted the corresponding Tyr-63 with Phe-63 in PVA VPg. This point mutation did not have any obvious effect on the uridylylation reaction, indicating that another tyrosine residue was uridylylated in the in vitro reaction (data not shown). Nucleotide Specificity of the NIB-catalyzed Reaction—To analyze further the NIB-catalyzed nucleotidylation reaction, the effect of each of the four ribonucleotides, ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, was tested in competition assays. The nucleotidylation reactions were carried out in the presence of constant amounts of [α-32P]UTP and increasing amounts of cold ribonucleotides. Clear specificity for [α-32P]UTP was detected in low cold NTP concentrations (0.125 μm) both in the presence (Fig. 6A) and absence (Fig. 6B) of a poly(A) template. As the competitor nucleotide concentrations increased, the specificity of the reaction for UTP decreased. In concentrations above 0.75 μm the other nucleotides were equally able to compete with [α-32P]UTP. These results suggest an RNA-independent selection for UTP at the substrate-binding site either within VPg or NIb. A Putative Nucleotide-binding Site within PVA VPg—A PVA VPg sequence motif, which contains a putative nucleotide-binding site, was identified by using the program Prosite (us.expasy.org). To verify that VPg is indeed an NTP-binding protein, we carried out a cross-linking experiment with oxidized [α-32P]UTP in the presence of a reducing agent, NaCNBH3, and either Mg2+ or Mn2+ in similar 5 mm concentrations that were used in the nucleotidylation reactions. The results indicated that wild type VPg binds oxidized UTP in the presence of divalent metal ions (Fig. 7A). Again, Mn2+ was clearly preferred over Mg2+ as in the uridylylation reaction. It has been proposed that under the reaction conditions we used, the cross-link is formed between the oxidized nucleotide and a lysine residue (31Richards O.C. Ehrenfeld E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23261-23264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The predicted nucleotide-binding sequence of PVA VPg (38AYTKKGK44) contains three lysine residues. Deletion of this 7-amino acid-long region in VPg (Δ38–44) affected nucleotide binding (Fig. 7A), decreasing it by ∼80% as compared with the wild type VPg. Because chemical cross-linking of the oxidized nucleotide to a protein may occur nonspecifically via exposed lysine, some residual binding was expected (24Richards O.C. Hanson J.L. Schultz S. Ehrenfeld E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6288-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To understand the influence of the putative NTP-binding site on the NIB-catalyzed uridylylation reaction, the deletion mutant VPg Δ38–44 was assayed in the in vitro uridylylation reaction. The efficiency of uridylylation of VPg Δ38–44 was only 30% of that of wild type VPg (Fi"

This small monomeric G protein is both necessary and sufficient for activation of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). The mechanism by which K-Ras enhances ENaC activity, however, is uncertain. We demonstrate here that K-Ras activates human ENaC reconstituted in Chinese hamster ovary cells in a GTP-dependent manner. K-Ras influences ENaC activity most likely by affecting open probability. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3K) abolished K-Ras actions on ENaC. In contrast, inhibition of other K-Ras effector cascades, including the MAPK and Ral/Rac/Rho cascades, did not affect K-Ras actions on ENaC. Activation of ENaC by K-Ras, moreover, was sensitive to co-expression of dominant negative p85PI3K. The G12:C40 effector-specific double mutant of Ras, which preferentially activates PI3K, enhanced ENaC activity in a manner sensitive to inhibition of PI3K. Other effector-specific mutants preferentially activating MAPK and RalGDS signaling had no effect. Constitutively active PI3K activated ENaC independent of K-Ras with the effects of PI3K and K-Ras on ENaC not being additive. We conclude that K-Ras activates ENaC via the PI3K cascade.

Small monomeric G proteins, including Ras, are GTP-dependent signaling switches that control cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation, as well as playing important signaling roles in differentiated cells (1Bar-Sagi D.

There are four homologous Ras proteins, K-RasA, K-RasB, H-Ras, and N-Ras, capable of activating similar downstream effectors with Ras having three primary first effectors, Raf, RalGDS, and PI3K, 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-OH kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EF, evanescent field; pF, picofarad; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; CFP-M, CFP-tagged membrane marker; GDPβS, guanyl-5′-yl thiophosphate; NHS-LC, succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate. initiating the MAPK 1/2, Ral/Rac/Rho, and PI3K signaling cascades, respectively. Signaling mediated by Ras and other Ras-like small G proteins can impinge upon the activity of membrane-resident ion channels. For instance, Ras signaling leads to phosphorylation of Kir causing decreased channel activity (4Hida H. Takeda M. Soliven B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8712-8719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); small G proteins within the RGK family directly interact with the β-subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels promoting retrieval from the plasma membrane and decreased channel activity (5Beguin P.

Biol. 2004; 24: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); Rac and Rho have opposing actions on ether-a-go-go-related gene K+ channels with the prior rapidly activating the channel and the latter quickly decreasing channel activity (8Storey N. O'Bryan J.P. Armstrong D.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); similarly, Rap and Ras have opposing actions on muscarinic K+ channels (9Yatani A. Quilliam L.A. Brown A.M. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22222-22226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and Ras via MAPK signaling decreases the activity of IRK1 by promoting retrieval of the channel from the plasma membrane (10Giovannardi S.

Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, a wide variety of ion channels are final effectors for Ras and other small G proteins. Activity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is rate-limiting for electrogenic Na+ transport across electrically tight epithelia, such as that lining the distal colon and renal nephron (12Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F559-F576Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Verrey F. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 144: 93-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Systemic Na+ levels are maintained in balance through a classic negative feedback pathway involving activation of ENaC by the steroid hormone aldosterone. Similar to other steroids, aldosterone affects gene expression to influence the activity of its target proteins; however, aldosterone-dependent increases in ENaC activity precede effects on channel expression leading to the proposal that aldosterone influences ENaC activity by promoting the expression of mobile signaling molecules capable of transducing information from the nucleus to existing channels. K-RasA is regulated by aldosterone at the level of transcription (15Spindler B. Mastroberardino L. Custer M. Verrey F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 434: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with aldosterone promoting MAPK signaling in epithelia via induction of this small G protein (16Hendron E. Stockand J.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3042-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Spindler B. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1154-C1161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, K-RasA is necessary and sufficient for ENaC activation in some models (18Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G. Al-Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35449-35454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Forster I. Loffing J. Assandri R. May A. Verrey F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3417-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which makes this small G protein an attractive candidate to transduce aldosterone actions from the nucleus to the channel. However, the direct role of Ras in regulation of ENaC is unclear with its mechanism of action and the cell signal transduction pathways involving Ras actions on ENaC being uncertain. Insulin, in addition to aldosterone, increases Na+ reabsorption with PI3K being necessary to both aldosterone and insulin actions on Na+ transport (20Blazer-Yost B.L. Paunescu T.G. Helman S.I.

Moreover, aldosterone increases the levels of the phospholipid products of PI3K in epithelial cells, and these phospholipids have recently been shown to directly enhance ENaC activity (20Blazer-Yost B.L.

Because PI3K is a first effector of Ras, we tested whether activation of ENaC in response to K-Ras was mediated by signaling through this lipid kinase. The current results are consistent with K-Ras activating ENaC via PI3K.

Current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current with a bath solution of (in mm) 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) and a pipette solution of (in mm) 120 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 5 EGTA, 2 MgCl2, 2 ATP, 0.1 GTP, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4).

In brief, cells were lysed in gentle lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40), cleared, normalized for total protein concentration, suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and 20 mm dithiothreitol, heated at 85 °C for 10 min, run on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels (100 μg of total protein/well) in the presence of SDS, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with antibody in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5% dried milk (Nestle, Solon, OH) and 0.1% Tween 20. Membrane labeling experiments closely followed those described previously (27Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Forty-eight h after transfection cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0) and subsequently incubated with 1 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 8.0) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted in gentle lysis buffer (1.0% Nonidet P-40).

Evanescent Field (EF) Fluorescence Microscopy—To determine whether K-Ras co-expression affected ENaC membrane levels, we selectively illuminated the plasma membrane with EF microscopy as described previously (26Tong Q.

In brief, EF microscopy was performed using an inverted TE2000 microscope with through-the-lens fluorescence imaging. Evanescent field illumination was generated by total internal reflection after the light beam struck the interface between the glass coverslip and cellular plasma membrane at a glancing angle. Samples were viewed through a Plan Apo total internal reflection 60× oil immersion, high resolution (1.45 numerical aperture) objective (Nikon). Total internal reflection generates an EF that declines exponentially with increasing distance from the interface between the cover glass and plasma membrane illuminating only a small optical slice of the cell (∼200 nm) including the plasma membrane. Thus, with total internal reflection only fluorophores in the plasma membrane and its immediate vicinity contribute to emission, whereas those deeper in the cell do not (26Tong Q. Gamper N.

An argon laser with excitation filters of 458 (±5) and 488 (±5) nm was used to excite a membrane marker (CFP-M) and NH2-YFP-tagged αENaC (expressed with untagged β- and γENaC), respectively. Tagged ENaC constructs were functional. 2A. Staruschenko, P. Patel, Q. Tong, J. L. Medina, and J. D. Stockand, unpublished observations. Emissions from the CFP and YFP fluorophores subsequently passed through 480 nm (±15; 465 nm dichroic) and 535 nm (±25; 505 nm dichroic) single pass filters, respectively. Images were collected and processed with a charge-coupled device camera interfaced to a personal computer running Metamorph software. Integrated intensity levels for membrane YFP-tagged ENaC were normalized to internal CFP-M controls. Statistics—All patch clamp data are presented as mean ± S.E. Paired and unpaired data were compared using appropriate t tests, with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. K-Ras Increases ENaC Activity in a GTP-dependent Manner—To investigate the actions of K-Ras on ENaC, we reconstituted the channel in CHO cells in the absence and presence of co-expressed wild type, constitutively active (G12V) and dominant negative (S17N) K-Ras. Human ENaC was reconstituted by co-expressing α, β and γ channel subunits together. Fig. 1A shows typical currents from a voltage clamp experiment performed on a CHO cell containing human ENaC before and after treatment with amiloride. Amiloride is an open channel blocker of ENaC (14Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Currents were elicited by applying test pulses from 60 to -100 mV with 20-mV steps. Overexpression of ENaC resulted in robust amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ currents that were not present in untransfected cells (not shown, see Refs. 24Tong Q. Booth R.E. Worrell R.T. Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1232-F1238Google Scholar, 26Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows ENaC currents before and after treatment with amiloride in a cell expressing the channel alone (left) and in a cell expressing both the channel and constitutively active K-Ras (right). Currents were elicited by voltage ramping from 60 mV down to -100 mV (holding potential = 30 mV). As summarized in Fig. 1C, co-expression of wild type and constitutively active but not dominant negative K-Ras significantly increased ENaC activity. Overexpression of K-Ras had no effect on cell capacitance as shown in Fig. 1D. We interpret these results as showing that K-Ras enhances ENaC activity but that this channel does have some basal activity in CHO cells that is independent of K-Ras signaling. We next tested whether K-Ras actions on ENaC were dependent on GTP activation of this small G protein. Fig. 2A shows current through ENaC in the presence of constitutively active K-Ras elicited by a train of voltage ramps applied every 5 s over the course of several min. For this experiment, 2.0 mm GDPβS replaced the GTP in typical pipette solutions. As the cytosol was dialyzed with GDPβS, ENaC activity decreased over time indicating that GTP was necessary for K-Ras to enhance channel activity. Run-down of ENaC activity in whole cell voltage clamp experiments was never observed (not shown, see Refs. 26Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 27Booth R.E. Medina J. Snyder P.M. Patel P. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41367-41379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and thus the decrease in activity observed in Fig. 2A resulted from GDPβS-competing GTP. Fig. 2B shows an overlay of ENaC currents before and after dialyzing GDPβS and the subsequent application of amiloride. As demonstrated by the summary graph in Fig. 2C, GTP is necessary for K-Ras activation of ENaC. Interestingly but not further pursued in the current study, we saw a modest effect of GDPβS on the K-Ras-independent basal activity of ENaC suggesting that other endogenous GTP-dependent proteins also impinge upon activity of this channel. K-Ras Activation of ENaC Is Mediated by PI3K Signaling—We next asked whether K-Ras activated ENaC through signaling via one of its downstream effector cascades, the MAPK, PI3K, and Ral/Rac/Rho cascades. Fig. 3A shows overlays of ENaC currents from typical whole cell voltage clamp experiments elicited by standard voltage ramps before and after amiloride. Currents are from cells expressing ENaC plus K-Ras in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of pretreatment with wortmannin (200 nm, 4-5 h), which is an irreversible inhibitor of PI3K (31Fruman D. Meyers R. Cantley L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 507Crossref Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B summarizes the effects of inhibitors of MAPK (10 μm PD98059, 1-2 h; 500 nm U0126, 1-3 h), Ral/Rac/Rho/Rho kinase (500 nm Y27632, 0.5-1 h; 15 μg/ml C3 exoenzyme included in pipette solution), and PI3K (wortmannin, 200 nm) signaling on K-Ras activation of ENaC. Co-expression of K-Ras with ENaC significantly increased channel current density from 157 ± 10 to 487 ± 34 pA/pF. Although pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin significantly decreased K-Ras-dependent ENaC activity to 46 ± 20 pA/pF, the inhibitors of other K-Ras effector cascades had no effect. We conclude from these results that PI3K is necessary to K-Ras-dependent activation of ENaC suggesting that this small G protein activates the channel via PI3K signaling. Because PI3K is a known first effector of K-Ras (3Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) and we have reported previously that K-Ras interacts with PI3K in an aldosterone-sensitive manner (24Tong Q. Booth R.E. Worrell R.T. Stockand J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F1232-F1238Google Scholar), we position this lipid kinase downstream of K-Ras in the aldosterone to ENaC transduction cascade. Results shown in Fig. 4 further supported the idea that PI3K is integral to K-Ras activation of ENaC and that the lipid kinase is positioned between the small G protein and the channel. Shown in Fig. 4A are representative current traces elicited by voltage ramps from cells expressing ENaC plus effector-specific mutants of Ras that are capable of interacting with and thus initiating signaling through only a single first effector. The Ras effector-specific mutant G12:E38 activates only c-Raf kinase and thus, MAPK signaling; the G12:G37 mutant only activates RalGDS and thus Ral/Rac/Rho signaling; and the G12:C40 mutant only activates PI3K and its dependent signal transduction cascade (3Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Only this latter mutant enhanced ENaC activity. Also as shown by a representative current trace in Fig. 4A, enhancement of activity by the C40 mutant was sensitive, as expected, to inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin. The summary graph in Fig. 4B demonstrates that ENaC activity in the presence of the constitutively active Ras effector-specific G12:C40 mutant was not different from that observed with constitutively active Ras, with both being greater than ENaC alone and ENaC plus the other first effector-specific Ras mutants. The summary graph in Fig. 4C demonstrates that wortmannin significantly decreased ENaC activity in the presence of RasG12:C40 to a level similar to that observed for expression of the channel alone. Results shown in Fig. 5 are also consistent with PI3K being necessary for K-Ras activation of ENaC. Fig. 5A shows a summary graph of ENaC activity when channel subunits are expressed alone and with K-Ras in the absence and presence of co-expression of dominant negative PI3K (p85 ΔiSH2-C) (3Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Inclusion of dominant negative PI3K with K-Ras significantly decreased ENaC activity from 445 ± 12 to 317 ± 38 pA/pF. Fig. 5, B-D, shows population histograms describing ENaC activity in the absence of K-Ras (Fig. 5B), and presence of co-expressed K-Ras (Fig. 5C) and co-expressed K-Ras plus dominant negative PI3K (Fig. 5D). The populations describing both ENaC alone and ENaC in the presence of K-Ras were normally distributed around a single mean (ENaC alone = 156 ± 11 pA/pF). In contrast, two ENaC populations were observed when the channel was co-expressed with K-Ras plus dominant negative PI3K. These populations were normally distributed around means of 155 ± 14 (n = 13) and 479 ± 36 (n = 13) pA/pF. Two mechanisms may explain the appearance of the population with the lower activity when ENaC is co-expressed with both K-Ras and dominant negative PI3K. It may result from a titration effect or from the dominant negative PI3K uncoupling K-Ras signaling to the channel. Results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 support the latter possibility. Moreover, ENaC activity in the presence of co-expressed K-Ras is normally distributed, indicating that in this population there was no titration effect. Finally, when ENaC was co-expressed with K-Ras plus another construct that did not impact PI3K signaling, we saw a single distribution with a mean current density of 433 ± 53 pA/pF (n = 15, not shown), which was similar to that observed with K-Ras alone, excluding a titration effect. Thus, we interpret the results in Fig. 5D as demonstrating that dominant negative PI3K uncouples K-Ras to ENaC signaling. If this interpretation is correct, then there must be a threshold effect of PI3K on the channel with activated PI3K resulting in channels with high activity and inactivated PI3K leading to channels even in the presence of K-Ras with basal activity. This possibility is consistent with our previous findings that the phospholipid products of PI3K directly affect ENaC by stabilizing channel gating transitions (26Tong Q. Gamper N. Medina J.L. Shapiro M.S. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22654-22663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We predicted that if K-Ras activated ENaC via PI3K, then expression of constitutively active PI3K alone with ENaC should activate the channel, and the effects of co-expressing PI3K with K-Ras on ENaC should not be additive. Indeed, co-expression of constitutively active PI3K (myr-PI 3-K p110α), which has a c-Src myristoylation sequence localizing it to the plasma membrane (28Kristof A. Marks-Konczalik J. Billings E. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33637-33644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), with ENaC significantly increased channel activity from 139 ± 17 to 464 ± 51 pA/pF (n = 16; data not shown). Channel activity, in addition, in the presence of co-expressed constitutively active PI3K plus K-RasG12V was 570 ± 93 pF/pA (n = 10), which was not different compared with K-RasG12V (571 ± 139, n = 5) or constitutively active PI3K alone. Both of these results are consistent with the idea that K-Ras and PI3K signal to ENaC through the same transduction cascade. K-Ras Enhances ENaC Activity Independent of Effects on Membrane Levels of the Channel—We next tested whether co-expression of K-Ras with ENaC activated the channel by increasing the number of channels in the plasma membrane. The rationale for testing this hypothesis was that PI3K signaling ultimately t"

HGF acquires signaling activity only upon proteolytic cleavage of single-chain HGF into its α/β heterodimer, similar to zymogen activation of structurally related serine proteases. Although both chains are required for activation, only the α-chain binds Met with high affinity. Recently, we reported that the protease-like HGF β-chain binds to Met with low affinity (Stamos, J., Lazarus, R. A., Yao, X., Kirchhofer, D., and Wiesmann, C. (2004) EMBO J. 23, 2325-2335). Here we demonstrate that the zymogen-like form of HGF β also binds Met, albeit with 14-fold lower affinity than the protease-like form, suggesting optimal interactions result from conformational changes upon cleavage of the single-chain form. Extensive mutagenesis of the HGF β region corresponding to the active site and activation domain of serine proteases showed that 17 of the 38 purified two-chain HGF mutants resulted in impaired cell migration or Met phosphorylation but no loss in Met binding. However, reduced biological activities were well correlated with reduced Met binding of corresponding mutants of HGF β itself in assays eliminating dominant α-chain binding contributions. Moreover, the crystal structure of HGF β determined at 2.53 Å resolution provides a structural context for the mutagenesis data. The functional Met binding site is centered on the “active site region” including “triad” residues Gln534 [c57], Asp578 [c102], and Tyr673 [c195] and neighboring “activation domain” residues Val692, Pro693, Gly694, Arg695, and Gly696 [c214-c219].

HGF belongs to the plasminogen-related growth factor family and comprises a 69-kDa α-chain, containing the N-terminal finger domain (N) and four kringle (K1-K4) domains, and a 34-kDa β-chain, which has strong similarity to protease domains of chymotrypsin-like serine proteases from Clan PA(S)/Family S1 (1Nakamura T.

A noncleavable single-chain form of HGF containing an R494E mutation binds Met with high affinity; however, it cannot activate the receptor (11Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E.

The protease-like domain of HGF (HGF β-chain) lacks the Asp [c102]-His [c57]-Ser [c195] (standard chymotrypsinogen numbering in brackets throughout) catalytic triad found in all serine proteases (15Perona J.J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 337-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 16Hedstrom L. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4501-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar), having a Gln534 [c57] and Tyr673 [c195] instead, and thus is devoid of any enzymatic activity. We investigated the importance of the protease-like domain of HGF for molecular interactions with Met based upon a significant similarity to serine proteases and their activation process (9Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In serine proteases, cleavage of the zymogen effects a conformational rearrangement of the so-called “activation domain” giving rise to a properly formed active site and the substrate/inhibitor interaction region. The activation domain constitutes three surface-exposed loops designated the [c140], [c180], and [c220] loops and the newly formed N terminus, which inserts into a hydrophobic pocket (17Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We thus reasoned that rearrangements in the corresponding “activation domain” of the HGF β-chain might form a Met interaction site. In the homologous ligand/receptor pair macrophage-stimulating protein (MSP)/Ron, the serine protease-like MSP β-chain provides the main energy for receptor binding (18Wang M.H. Julian F.M.

Leonard E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is reversed from the HGF/Met system where the high affinity receptor binding site for Met resides in the HGF α-chain (20Lokker N.A. Presta L.G. Godowski P.J. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Okigaki M. Komada M. Uehara Y. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9555-9561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To better understand the binding requirements and mechanism for Met activation and signaling, we expressed and purified various forms of HGF β. Consistent with our recently published data (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), we find that the wild type protease-like HGF β binds to Met. A zymogen-like single-chain form of HGF β (scHGF β) also binds to Met, but with lower affinity, suggesting that this Met binding site is influenced by a conformational rearrangement upon cleavage. Met binding residues were identified by mutagenesis studies on both full-length HGF and the HGF β-chain and were mapped onto the crystal structure of HGF β, which was determined to a resolution of 2.53 Å. The mutagenesis results define a distinct Met binding site, which consists of residues of the “active site region” and “activation domain” of the serine protease-like HGF β-chain. Models of Met dimerization and activation by two-chain HGF are discussed. Expression and Purification of HGF β Proteins—All HGF β proteins (Val495 [c16] to Ser728 [c250]), which contained a His6 C-terminal tag, were expressed and purified to homogeneity (>95% purity) as described previously (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Wild type HGF β refers to the native sequence, and HGF β refers to the C604S [c128] mutant. HGF β mutants Q534A [c57], D578A [c102], Y619A [c143], R695A [c217], G696A [c219], and I699A [c221a] were made using QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in the C604S [c128] construct. scHGF β encodes HGF from residues Asn479 to Ser728, a His6 C-terminal tag, and has an R494E mutation made using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAAAACGAAACAATTGGAAGTTGTAAATGGGATTC-3′. The cysteine was not altered in this construct to allow putative disulfide formation between Cys487 and Cys604 [c128]. Tranfection of Sf9 cells on plates in ESF 921 media (Expression Systems LLC, Woodland, CA) was carried out using the BaculoGold™ Expression System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pharmingen). Virus amplification, cell culture, and purification was carried out essentially as described previously except that the elution buffer for the nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose column contained 500 mm imidazole instead of 250 mm imidazole (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry. Protein concentration was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. N-terminal sequencing revealed a single correct N terminus present for scHGF β and HGF β. Purified proteins showed the correct molecular mass on SDS-PAGE; multiple bands observed were likely due to heterogeneous glycosylation, consistent with the mass spectrometry data having molecular masses ∼2 kDa higher than predicted from the sequence. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Full-length HGF Proteins—Recombinant proteins were produced in 1-liter cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by transient transfection (23Peek M.

A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing. The expression medium (F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) contained 1% (v/v) ultra low IgG fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). After 8 days the medium was harvested and supplemented with FBS to give a final content of 5-10% (v/v). Additional incubation for 2-3 days at 37 °C resulted in complete single-chain HGF conversion. This step was omitted for expression of scHGF, a noncleavable single-chain form, which has amino acid changes at the activation cleavage site (R494E) and at a protease-susceptible site in the α-chain (R424A) (23Peek M. Moran P. Mendoza N. Wickramasinghe D. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47804-47809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins were purified from the medium by HiTrap-Sepharose SP cation exchange chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) as described (23Peek M. Moran P. Mendoza N. Wickramasinghe D. Kirchhofer D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47804-47809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Examination by SDS-PAGE (4-20% gradient gel) under reducing conditions and staining with Simply Blue Safestain (Invitrogen) showed that all HGF mutants were >95% pure and were fully converted into α/β heterodimers except for scHGF, which remained as a single-chain form. Protein concentration for each mutant was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Binding of HGF β to Met in a Competition Binding ELISA—To develop a competition ELISA, we first determined the direct specific binding of the HGF β-chain to Met in a plate ELISA. Microtiter plates were coated with Met-IgG fusion protein (25Mark M.R. Lokker N.A. Zioncheck T.F. Luis E.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26166-26171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and incubated with wild type HGF β-chain. Bound HGF β was detected using penta-His horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by addition of SureBlue TMB peroxidase substrate and TMB STOP (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). The determined effective concentration to give half-maximal binding (EC50) was 320 ± 140 nm (n = 6). Based on these results, a competition binding ELISA was developed as described (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) using wild type HGF β biotinylated with 20-fold molar excess of biotin-maleimide (Pierce). Briefly, plates were coated with Met-IgG fusion protein and incubated with a mixture of 250 nm biotinylated wild type HGF β and various concentrations of unlabeled HGF β, HGF β mutants, or scHGF β. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the amount of biotinylated wild type HGF β bound on the plate was measured by using horseradish peroxidase-neutravidin (Pierce). IC50 values were determined by fitting the data to a four-parameter equation (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Binding of HGF Mutants to Met—Biotinylated HGF (two-chain full length) was prepared using the Sigma immunoprobe biotinylation kit (Sigma). Microtiter plates were coated with rabbit anti-human IgG Fc-specific antibody as described above. Plates were washed in PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 followed by a 1-h incubation with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature. After washing, 1 nm biotinylated HGF and 0.2 nm Met-IgG fusion protein (25Mark M.R. Lokker N.A. Zioncheck T.F. Luis E.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26166-26171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) together with various concentrations of HGF mutants were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing, bound biotinylated HGF was detected by addition of diluted (1:3000) streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) followed by SureBlue TMB peroxidase substrate and stop solution TMB STOP (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). The A450 was measured, and IC50 values were determined as described above. Relative binding affinities are expressed as the IC50(mutant)/IC50(wild type HGF). HGF-dependent Phosphorylation of Met—The kinase receptor activation assay (KIRA) was carried out as follows. Confluent cultures of lung carcinoma A549 cells (CCL-185, ATCC, Manassas, VA), maintained previously in growth medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 50:50 (Invitrogen) containing 10% FBS (Sigma)), were detached using Accutase (ICN, Aurora, OH) and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells per well. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, growth medium was removed, and cells were serum-starved for 30-60 min in medium containing 0.1% FBS. Met phosphorylation activity by HGF and HGF mutants was determined from addition of serial dilutions from 500 to 0.2 ng/ml in medium containing 0.1% FBS followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, removal of media, and cell lysis with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture set I (Calbiochem). HGF β-chain studies were carried out similarly starting at 5 μg/ml. Cell lysates were analyzed for phosphorylated Met via an electrochemiluminescence assay using a BioVeris M-Series instrument (BioVeris Corp., Gaithersburg, MD). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was labeled with ORI-TAG via N-hydroxysuccinimide ester chemistry according to the manufacturer's directions (BioVeris). Anti-Met extracellular domain antibody 1928 (Genentech, Inc.) was biotinylated using biotin-X-N-hydroxysuccinimide (Research Organics, Cleveland, OH). The BV-TAG-labeled 4G10 and biotinylated anti-Met antibody were diluted in assay buffer (PBS, 0.5% Tween 10, 0.5% bovine serum albumin), and the mixture was added to the cell lysates. After incubation at room temperature with vigorous shaking for 1.5-2 h, streptavidin magnetic beads (Dynabeads, BioVeris) were added and incubated for 45 min. The beads with bound material (anti-Met antibody/Met/anti-phosphotyrosine antibody) were captured by an externally applied magnet. After a wash step, the chemiluminescent signal generated by the light source was measured as relative luminescent units on a BioVeris instrument. For each experiment, the Met phosphorylation induced by HGF mutants was expressed as a percentage of the maximal signal obtained with two-chain HGF. Cell Migration Assay—Breast cancer cells MDA-MB435 (HTB-129, ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in recommended serum-supplemented medium. Confluent cells were detached in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA and diluted with serum-free medium to a final concentration of 0.6-0.8 × 106 cells/ml. This cell suspension (0.2 ml) was added in triplicate to the upper chambers of 24-well Transwell plates (8 μm pore size) (HTS Multiwell™ Insert System, Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) pre-coated with 10 μg/ml of rat tail collagen type I (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Wild type HGF or HGF mutants were added to the lower chamber at 1 nm in serum-free medium, unless specified otherwise. HGF β-chain was also tested at 0.95 μm. After incubation for 13-14 h, cells on the apical side of the membrane were removed, and those that migrated to the basal side were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by staining with a 0.5% crystal violet solution. After washing and air drying, cells were solubilized in 10% acetic acid, and the A560 was measured on a Molecular Devices microplate reader. Pro-migratory activities of HGF mutants were expressed as percent of HGF controls after subtracting basal migration in the absence of HGF. Photographs of stained cells were taken with a Spot digital camera (Diagnostics Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI) connected to a Leitz microscope (Leica Mikroskope & Systeme GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). Pictures were acquired by Adobe Photoshop 4.0.1 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). HGF β X-ray Structure—Purified HGF β was concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a Centriprep® YM-10 in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2. Hanging drops (1 μl of protein and 1 μl of 30% PEG-1500) over a reservoir containing 500 μl of 30% PEG-1500 (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA) yielded crystalline rods (∼25 × 25 × 500 μm) during incubation at 19 °C overnight. A crystal fragment was preserved directly from the mother liquor by immersion in liquid nitrogen. Data extending to 2.53 Å resolution were collected on a Quantum 4 ccd detector (ADSC, Poway, CA) at ALS beam line 5.0.2 with 1.0 Å wavelength x-rays. Data processing and reduction were performed using HKL (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) (HKL Research, Charlottesville, VA) and CCP4 (27Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (28Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Refinement was performed using X-PLOR98 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) and REFMAC (30Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). Inspection of electron density maps and model manipulation was performed using XtalView (31McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar) (Syrrx, San Diego, CA). Binding of HGF β to Met—Because single-chain HGF binds to Met with comparable affinity to that of two-chain HGF, but does not induce Met phosphorylation (11Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Lokker N.A. Mark M.R. Luis E.A. Bennett G.L.

Tsubouchi H. Blasi F. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4825-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that this may be due to the lack of a Met binding site in the uncleaved form of the β-chain. To test this hypothesis, we carried out competition binding ELISAs with expressed and purified HGF β and scHGF β. scHGF β is a zymogen-like form of HGF β containing the C-terminal 16 residues from the HGF α-chain and a mutation at the cleavage site (R494E) to ensure that the single-chain form remained intact. Initial ELISA data showed that HGF β directly bound to immobilized Met-IgG fusion protein, albeit with relatively low affinity. This is consistent with our recent data from surface plasmon resonance experiments with immobilized Met extracellular domain, where a Kd of ∼90 nm for the HGF β/Met interaction was found (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the HGF β/Met competition binding ELISA we determined IC50 values of 0.86 ± 0.17 and 11.6 ± 1.8 μm for HGF β and the precursor form scHGF β, respectively, showing that scHGF β bound Met with 14-fold lower affinity than HGF β (Fig. 1A). Thus, although a Met binding site on the zymogen-like HGF β does in fact exist, it is not optimal. The apparent affinity differences observed between Kd (22Stamos J. Lazarus R.A. Yao X. Kirchhofer D. Wiesmann C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and IC50 values are due to the different assays used; the higher IC50 values reflect the higher concentrations of HGF β necessary to compete with 250 nm biotinylated HGF β for binding to Met. We also measured the ability of HGF β to stimulate Met phosphorylation of A549 lung cancer cells. Fig. 1B shows that HGF β was completely inactive, even at concentrations that exceeded optimal phosphorylation activity by full-length HGF by >1000-fold. Similarly, in MDA-MB435 cell migration assays, HGF β at concentrations of up to 0.95 μm had no effect. These results are consistent with other studies demonstrating the inability of HGF β to activate the Met receptor (11Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W.

Effects on Cell Migration and Met Phosphorylation by HGF and HGF β-Chain Mutants—To identify the Met binding site in the β-chain, we systematically changed residues in regions corresponding to the activation domain and the active site of serine proteases, herein referred to as the “activation domain” and “active site region” of HGF. Initial expression of HGF mutants in CHO cells yielded a mixture of single- and two-chain HGF forms, exemplified by mutant HGF I623A (Fig. 2A). Complete conversion of residual uncleaved HGF was accomplished by additional exposure of the harvested culture medium to 5-10% serum for several days (Fig. 2A). The purity of HGF I623A [c149] following purification by cation exchange chromatography is representative of all HGF mutants. The functional consequence of mutating β-chain residues in HGF was assessed by determining the ability of the HGF mutants to stimulate migration of MDA-MB435 cells. The results showed that 3 HGF mutants, R695A [c217], G696A [c219], and Y673A [c195], were severely impaired, having less than 20% of wild type activity, whereas 5 mutants Q534A [c57], D578A [c102], V692A [c214], P693A [c215], and G694A [c216] had 20-60% of wild type activity (Fig. 2B). An additional set of 9 mutants (R514A [c36], P537A [c60a], Y619A [c143], T620A [c144], G621A [c145], K649A [c173], I699A [c221a], N701A [c223], and R702A"

Here we investigated the mechanism of action of VEGF-D, and we compared the signaling pathways and biological responses induced by VEGF-D and VEGF-A in endothelial cells. VEGF-D induced KDR and phospholipase C-γ tyrosine phosphorylation more slowly and less effectively than VEGF-A at early times but had a more sustained effect and was as effective as VEGF-A after 60 min. VEGF-D activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 with similar efficacy but slower kinetics compared with VEGF-A, and this effect was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. In contrast to VEGF-A, VEGF-D weakly stimulated prostacyclin production and gene expression, had little effect on cell proliferation, and stimulated a smaller and more transient increase in intracellular [Ca2+]. VEGF-D induced strong but more transient phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated Akt activation and increased PI3K-dependent endothelial nitric-oxide synthase phosphorylation and cell survival more weakly. VEGF-D stimulated chemotaxis via a PI3K/Akt- and endothelial nitric-oxide synthase-dependent pathway, enhanced protein kinase C- and PI3K-dependent endothelial tubulogenesis, and stimulated angiogenesis in a mouse sponge implant model less effectively than VEGF-A. VEGF-D-induced signaling and biological effects were blocked by the KDR inhibitor SU5614. The finding that differential KDR activation by VEGF-A and VEGF-D has distinct consequences for endothelial signaling and function has important implications for understanding how multiple ligands for the same VEGF receptors can generate ligand-specific biological responses.

KDR is activated through ligand-stimulated receptor dimerization and trans(auto)phosphorylation of at least six tyrosine residues as follows: Tyr-951 and Tyr-996 in the kinase insert; Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1059 in the kinase domain; and Tyr-1175 and Tyr-1214 in the C-terminal tail (3Neufeld G.

VEGF-D also stimulates lymphoangiogenesis in mice when overexpressed in skin keratinocytes and tumors (23Veikkola T. Jussila L. Makinen T. Karpanen T. Jeltsch M. Petrova T.V. Kubo H. Thurston G.

Karpanen T. Catimel B. Nice E.C. Wise L. Mercer A. Kowalski H. Kerjaschki D. Stacker S.A. Achen M.G. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4762-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). However, in comparison to VEGF-A, little is known about the biological activities and signal transduction pathways initiated by VEGF-D in vascular endothelial cells, and the mechanisms underlying the biological effects of VEGF-D are poorly understood.In the present study, we compared the biological functions and signaling pathways stimulated by VEGF-A and the fully processed form of VEGF-D in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and we assessed the role of VEGFR2/KDR in endothelial functions of VEGF-D. The results show that although VEGF-D and VEGF-A exhibit some overlap in their endothelial biological effects, they also have marked differential effects on KDR phosphorylation, KDR-mediated signaling, and a range of biological responses including PGI2 production, eNOS phosphorylation, gene expression, proliferation, survival, migration, tubulogenesis, and angiogenesis in vivo. These results indicate that KDR is differentially regulated by VEGF-A and VEGF-D in vascular endothelial cells and have implications for understanding the basis for the generation of distinct ligand-specific cellular responses through activation of KDR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Recombinant human VEGF-A165 and fully processed VEGF-D were obtained from R & D Systems. SU5614, LY294002, wortmannin, PKC inhibitors, and 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA/AM) were from Calbiochem. Phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody against KDR (Tyr-1054/Tyr-1059) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibody against ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) was purchased from New England Biolabs; phosphospecific rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PLCγ1-Tyr-783, Akt-Ser-473, and eNOS-Ser-1177 were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Medium 199 was from Invitrogen. Endothelial cell basal medium (EBM) was from Clonetics. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available.Cell Culture—HUVECs were purchased from TCS CellWorks and cultured in EBM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 12 μg/ml bovine brain extract, 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate, and 50 ng/ml amphotericin-8.Immunoblotting—After treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and immediately extracted by lysis buffer (64 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), heated at 99 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to Immobilon membranes (Millipore), the membranes were then blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in PBS, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Tween 20, and proteins were immunoblotted with primary phosphospecific antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL plus, Amersham Biosciences). Equal protein loading was assessed by blotting parallel samples with antibodies to total proteins.125I-VEGF-A165Binding—Confluent endothelial cells in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS. At 4 °C various concentrations of VEGF-A or VEGF-D diluted in binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, containing 0.1% BSA) were added, followed by addition of the indicated concentration of 125I-VEGF-A165 (1200–1800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). After 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the medium was aspirated and washed four times with cold PBS. The cells were lysed with 0.25 m NaOH, 0.5% SDS solution, and the bound radioactivity of the lysates was measured. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100-fold excess unlabeled VEGF-A165.Measurement of [Ca2+]—Confluent HUVECs plated on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were incubated in EBM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and Fluo-4 AM (4 μm; Molecular Probes) for 20 min; the cells were then washed to remove extracellular Fluo-4 AM and incubated in PBS. In some experiments, cells were incubated in Ca2+-free PBS containing 1.5 μm EGTA. Cells were mounted on the stage of a Zeiss 510CLSM microscope, and images of fluorescence were obtained before and after application of VEGFA or VEGFD (λexcitation 488 nm, λemission 505–550 nm).PGI2Assay—Following treatments, the PGI2 content of the cell supernatants was measured by an enzyme immunoassay of its stable metabolite, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1α, using a kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Cell Proliferation—HUVECs were seeded at a density of 104 cells per well in 24-well plates. 24 h after plating, the medium was replaced with fresh EBM containing 0.5% FBS and 25 ng/ml VEGF-A165 or 1 μg/ml VEGF-D. After 3 days, the cell numbers were determined by using a Sysmex CDA-500 cell counter.Cell Migration—Cell migration was measured in a modified Boyden chemotaxis chamber (NeuroProbe Inc., Cabin John, MD) as described (12Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Growth factors in M199, 1% BSA were placed in the bottom wells of the chamber; polycarbonate filters with 8-μm pores (Osmonics Poretics) were placed between the bottom and top chambers. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in M199, 1% BSA to give a final cell concentration of 3 × 105/ml. 15,000 cells with or without inhibitors as indicated were placed into each well of the top chamber, and the chemotaxis chambers were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After the incubation, unmigrated cells were removed from the top side of the filters, and migrated cells were stained with Diff-Quik. The stained cells from each well were counted at ×100 magnification using an eyepiece indexed graticule.Apoptosis—Subconfluent HUVECs in 6-well plates were washed twice with serum-free M199 medium and incubated with the indicated additions for 24 h. The cells were then trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, and stained with fluorescein-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (Roche Diagnostics). After staining, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Annexin V-positive staining cells were counted as apoptotic cells.RNA Preparation and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). After DNase I treatment, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT)12–18 primer using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and diluted for real time PCR. Primers for real time PCR (Sigma Genosys) were designed by Primer3 software (www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi) by using the 3′-untranslated region of the gene sequence to ensure the specificity of the fragment and ensuring that amplified fragments were 200–250 bp (Table I). Amplification of predicted fragments was verified by conventional RT-PCR. Real time PCR was performed using the LightCyclerFastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit and Lightcycler System (Roche Diagnostics). For each primer pair, a melting curve was used to identify a temperature where only amplicon, and not primer dimers, accounted for SYBR green-bound fluorescence. Real time RT-PCR was conducted in duplicate for each sample using RNA preparations from at least two independent experiments. Data were normalized to the reference gene GAPDH and presented as the mean fold change (±S.D.) compared with control.Table IPrimer sequences used for real time quantitative RT-PCRGeneForward 5′ to 3′Reverse 5′ to 3′GAPDHGTCAGTGGTGGACCTGACCTCCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAATNR4A1 (Nur 77)GCTGCAGAATGACTCCACCACAGCAGCACTGGGCTTANR4A2 (Nurr 1)TGCAGCAGCTTTTGACTGGGCAGTGACTCATATCATTGTCNR4A3 (Nor 1)GCCCTGACTGTCCAGCTATCTCCTGCTGATTTGCATGTTCEGR3AGGAAAACCTATGGGGAATGGGAGCAAATGAAATGTGGGTG Open table in a new tab Tubule Formation—Human endothelial cell-derived tubule formation was determined in a co-culture assay (TCS CellWorks). Growth factors and inhibitors were added at the start of the experiment and at each medium change at days 4, 7, and 9. At day 11, the cultures were fixed with 70% ethanol for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently immunostained for the endothelial cell adhesion molecule CD31. Fixed cells were incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-human CD31) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed three times in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% BSA), and then incubated with the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes in distilled water, the cells were finally incubated with the substrate solution of alkaline phosphatase for 10 min at 37 °C. Images of immunostained tubules were obtained with an Openlab Improvision system using a ×5 objective lens, and endothelial cell-derived tubule formation was quantified by Openlab image analysis software. In each experiment, control wells with VEGF-A or no addition were included.Murine Sponge Model—Sterile 8-mm polyurethane sponges were inserted under the dorsal skin of anesthetized black C57 female mice on day 0 (5 mice per treatment group). VEGF-D (100 μl of either 0.5, 1, or 2 μg/ml) or VEGF-A (100 μl of 25 ng/ml) recombinant proteins were injected into the sponges on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19. Mice were sacrificed on day 21, and sponges with surrounding tissue were excised and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde. Sections (6 μm) of paraffin-embedded sponges were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and blood vessels, scored as luminal structures containing red blood cells, were counted in a minimum of 5 fields per treatment group.Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using Prism (version 3.0) statistical packages. Comparisons of two sets of continuous variables were performed using the Student's t test. Differences in qualitative variables (apoptotic frequencies or percentages) between two groups were assessed by the χ2 test. Differences between treatment groups in the sponge implant assay were evaluated using a Kruskall-Wallis nonparametric analysis. A value of p < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant.RESULTSPhosphorylation and Activation of KDR and PLC-γ1 by VEGF-D—The ability of VEGF-D to activate KDR was examined by comparing the effects of VEGF-A and VEGF-D on KDR phosphorylation at Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1059 located within the catalytic domain, two residues required for full KDR activation (26Dougher M. Terman B.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates with an antibody against KDR phosphorylated at Tyr-1054 and Tyr-1059 showed that VEGF-A induced a striking increase in KDR phosphorylation after 5 min, which thereafter decreased rapidly although remaining above the control level after 60 min; in contrast, VEGF-D had no effect after 5 min, produced a detectable increase after 10 min, and induced a maximum increase in KDR phosphorylation after 30 min that persisted for up to 60 min (Fig. 1A). Treatments with different VEGF-D concentrations indicated that VEGF-D induced KDR phosphorylation at 500 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml after stimulation for either 10, 30, or 60 min, producing a much smaller response compared with VEGF-A after 10 min and similar effects to those of VEGF-A after 30 and 60 min (Fig. 1B). Although Flt-4 was expressed in HU-VECs, VEGF-D caused no detectable increase in Flt-4 tyrosine phosphorylation as assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of Flt-4 immunoprecipitates; in parallel cultures, VEGF-A induced a striking increase in KDR tyrosine phosphorylation assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot of KDR immunoprecipitates (results not shown).The weak effect of VEGF-D on KDR tyrosine phosphorylation in HUVECs prompted us to examine how well VEGF-D competed with VEGF-A for binding to high affinity receptor binding sites in these cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, VEGF-D caused only partial inhibition of specific 125I-VEGF binding to HUVECs with 20% inhibition of binding at 0.5 and 1 μg/ml. Because HUVECs express KDR, Flt-1, and NP-1 receptors for VEGF, the weak inhibition of specific 125I-VEGF binding to these cells by VEGF-D is at least partly due to the inability of this factor to bind to Flt-1 and NP-1.Increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-γ leading to PKC activation and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores is a key early response directly mediated by activation of KDR (7Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Chida K. Shibuya M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 8Gliki G. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Jezequel S. Wheeler-Jones C. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). VEGF-A induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ at tyrosine 783 after 5 and 10 min that declined at later times. In contrast, VEGF-D caused no detectable increase in PLC-γ Tyr-783 phosphorylation after 5 and 10 min but induced a significant increase after 60 min that was similar to the effect of VEGF-A at the same time of treatment (Fig. 2A). Treatment with different VEGF-D concentrations for 60 min showed that VEGF-D induced PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation at 500 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml similar to the concentration dependence observed for VEGF-D-induced KDR phosphorylation (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Induction of PLC-γ tyrosine phosphorylation by VEGF-D and VEGF-A.A, confluent and quiescent cultures of HU-VECs were incubated for the indicated times with medium (control, C), 25 ng/ml VEGF-A (A), or 1 μg/ml VEGF-D (D). Whole-cell lysates were then immunoblotted with antibodies to PLC-γ phosphorylated at Tyr-783 (upper) or total PLC-γ (lower). B, HUVECs were incubated for 60 min with medium (control, C), 25 ng/ml VEGF-A (A), or the indicated concentrations of VEGF-D and were immunoblotted as indicated in A. The results are representative of three independent experiments yielding very similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Activation of ERK1/2 and Intracellular Ca2+Signaling— VEGF-A induces ERK via a PKC-dependent pathway, and this pathway is essential for VEGF-A stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation (7Takahashi T.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2768-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) and mediates activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 leading to increased PGI2 production (8Gliki G. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Jezequel S. Wheeler-Jones C. Zachary I. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Wheeler-Jones C. Abu-Ghazaleh R. Cospedal R. Houliston R.A. Martin J. Zachary I. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). VEGF-D induced a strong concentration-dependent activation of ERK1/2 comparable with the effect of 25 ng/ml VEGF-A that was maximal at 500 ng/ml and 1 μg/ml (Fig. 3A). However, VEGF-D activated ERK1/2 more slowly than VEGF-A. VEGF-A induced a 14-fold increase in ERK1/2 activation after 2.5 min, whereas ERK activation stimulated by 1 μg/ml VEGF-D was 4-fold after 2.5 min, increasing to 12-fold after 5 min, and a maximum of 17-fold similar to the maximum effect of VEGF-A after 10 min (Fig. 3A). Pretreatment of HUVECs with either the KDR inhibitor SU5614, two structurally unrelated PKC inhibitors, GF109203X and calphostin C, or the MEK inhibitor, U0126, blocked VEGF-D-induced ERK1/2 activation, similar to their effects on VEGF-A-induced ERK activation (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Kinetics and mechanism of ERKs1/2 activation induced by VEGF-D and VEGF-A.A, confluent and quiescent cultures of HUVECs were incubated for the indicated times with 25 ng/ml VEGF-A, 1 μg/ml VEGF-D, or were incubated for 10 min with medium (C), 25 ng/ml VEGF-A (A), or the indicated concentrations of VEGF-D. Whole-cell lysates were prepared and immunoblotted with antibody to ERKs1/2 phosphorylated at Thr-202/Tyr-204 (upper) or total ERKs1/2 (lower). The results are representative of three independent experiments yielding very similar results. Fold increases in ERK2 phosphorylation relative to the control level after different times of VEGF-A and -D treatment were quantified by scanning densitometry and are indicated below the respective lanes. B, cells were pretreated for 15 min with either an equivalent volume of Me2SO (control, C), 5 μm SU5614 (SU), 3 μm GF109203X (GF), 3 μm calphostin C (Cp), or 10 μm U0126 (U) and then received no further addition or were treated for a further 10 min with 25 ng/ml VEGF-A (A)or1 μg/ml VEGF-D (D). Lysates were then immunoblotted with antibodies to either ERKs1/2 phosphorylated at Thr-202/Tyr-204 or total ERKs1/2.

https://openalex.org/W1967411577,"By frequently rearranging large regions of the genome, genetic recombination is a major determinant in the plasticity of the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) population. In retroviruses, recombination mostly occurs by template switching during reverse transcription. The generation of retroviral vectors provides a means to study this process after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture. Using HIV-1-derived vectors, we present here the first characterization and estimate of the strength of a recombination hot spot in HIV-1 in vivo. In the hot spot region, located within the C2 portion of the gp120 envelope gene, the rate of recombination is up to ten times higher than in the surrounding regions. The hot region corresponds to a previously identified RNA hairpin structure. Although recombination breakpoints in vivo cluster in the top portion of the hairpin, the bias for template switching in this same region appears less marked in a cell-free system. By modulating the stability of this hairpin we were able to affect the local recombination rate both in vitro and in infected cells, indicating that the local folding of the genomic RNA is a major parameter in the recombination process. This characterization of reverse transcription products generated after a single cycle of infection provides insights in the understanding of the mechanism of recombination in vivo and suggests that specific regions of the genome might be prompted to yield different rates of evolution due to the presence of circumscribed recombination hot spots.

In their extracellular life, retroviruses store genetic information as two copies of single-stranded RNA molecules. During synthesis of the complementary DNA strand, the reverse transcriptase (RT) 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; RTP, reverse transcription products; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; nt, nucleotide(s). frequently switches template between these two molecules, a process known as copy choice (1Weiss R.A. Mason W.S. Vogt P.K. Virology. 1973; 52: 535-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). If the two RNAs are not identical, this process can lead to genetic recombination. The diffusion of the AIDS pandemic has provided an alarming indication of the massive impact of recombination on the evolution of retroviruses. Indeed, by scattering and rearranging mutations already existing along the HIV-1 genome, recombination stands nowadays as a worldwide hindrance for molecular and serological diagnosis, vaccine development, and treatment against AIDS (2Peeters M. Toure-Kane C. Nkengasong J.N. AIDS. 2003; 17: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 3Rambaut A. Posada D. Crandall K.A. Holmes E.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2004; 5: 52-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Features of the HIV-1 infectious cycle, such as the poor fidelity of the RT (4Telesnitsky A. Goff S.P. Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 121-160Google Scholar), which boosts the probability of co-packaging non-identical viral RNAs, and the dynamic nature of HIV-1 infection, where de novo infection of CD4+ T cells amplifies the possibility of copy choice to occur during the repeated cycles of reverse transcription (5Douek D.C. Picker L.J. Koup R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 265-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), can explain the extremely high level of genetic recombination documented (6Peeters M. Sharp P.M. AIDS. 2000; 14: S129-S140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Dissecting the mechanisms underlying copy choice in vivo will contribute to the understanding of how recombination drives HIV-1 genome evolution. Several efforts have been made in this sense during the last decade, and various mechanisms have been proposed, based either on the infection of cells in culture (ex vivo systems) (7Onafuwa A. An W. Robson N.D. Telesnitsky A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4577-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Hwang C.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12209-12214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or on the reconstitution of the process of reverse transcription with purified proteins and nucleic acids (in vitro systems) (9DeStefano J.J.

Virol. 2003; 77: 4710-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Some hard facts have been jointly established by these two approaches, including the enhancement of template switching observed by decreasing the rate of DNA synthesis (13Pfeiffer J.K. Topping R.S. Shin N.H. Telesnitsky A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8441-8447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Rodriguez-Rodriguez L. Tsuchihashi Z. Fuentes G.M. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15005-15011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the importance of a temporal coupling of RT-encoded polymerase and RNaseH activities (8Hwang C.K. Svarovskaia E.S. Pathak V.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12209-12214Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11978-11983Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, detailed mechanistic models, mostly proposed solely on the basis of in vitro studies, still await an evaluation of their physiological relevance. In HIV-1, template switching appears as a frequent process. Indeed, ex vivo experiments in HeLa CD4+-infected cells estimated that three events of template switching occur, on average, per replication cycle (16Jetzt A.E. Yu H. Klarmann G.J. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has recently been shown that the recombination rates are influenced by the type of cell infected, with the highest rates observed in macrophages (17Levy D.N. Aldrovandi G.M. Kutsch O. Shaw G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4204-4209Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A crucial issue to address now is whether this high rate results from the presence of recombination hot spots interspersed among sequences yielding low recombination rates, or if it reflects a nearly constant frequency of strand transfer along the whole genome. Determining the existence of preferential sites for template switching is important, because they would constitute ideal sites for the study of the mechanisms of recombination, and they would pinpoint blocks of sequences with relatively independent evolutionary history along the genome. At present, indications on this issue are extremely scarce. An analysis of ten intra-subtype B recombinant clones generated in cell culture highlighted the presence of a few putative hot spots along the genome (18Zhuang J. Jetzt A.E. Sun G. Yu H. Klarmann G. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11273-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), but no molecular characterization of these hot spots was carried out. On the other hand, in vitro studies have highlighted the existence of local fluctuations in the frequency of strand transfer on different sequences leading to the proposal of various mechanistic sketches (10Moumen A.

However, no indication concerning the behavior of these sequences in vivo is available. Using a cell-free system we previously identified a sequence within the C2 region of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 where strand transfer was up to five times more frequent than in the surrounding regions (21Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This behavior was correlated to the folding of this portion of RNA into a large hairpin, because destabilizing this hairpin triggered a 4-fold decrease in the rate of template switching (10Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15973-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Here we have developed an experimental system to study recombination in HIV-1 after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture and used it to study recombination in the C2 region. DNA Constructs—HIV-1 cis-acting regulatory elements (HXB2 strain) were obtained by PCR amplification from pTRIP-GFP plasmid (22Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and cloned in a pKS-derived Knr/origin of replication backbone plasmid (21Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) following standard cloning techniques. For the study of recombination we have designed two types of plasmids differing in the genetic marker present upstream the sequence where recombination is studied. This marker is therefore transcribed after the studied sequence during reverse transcription. pLac+ and pLac– plasmids carry, as genetic markers, either a functional LacZ′ gene or a sequence complementary to a portion of the mRNA coding for Escherichia coli malT gene, respectively. These two genetic markers are indicated as lac+ and lac– in the schematic representation of these plasmids shown below in Fig. 1B. Sequences used as the region of homology were derived from in vitro vectors described previously (10Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15973-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and inserted after XhoI/BamHI or XhoI/BspHI restriction. The sequences previously called E2 and G1Eb were used here to generate C2 and Delhp genomic plasmids, respectively. All constructions were verified by sequencing. The transcomplementation plasmids used were pCMVΔR8.2 (23Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar), coding for HIV-1 gag, pol, and accessory proteins, and pHCMV-G (24Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), which carries the VSV envelope protein gene. Cells—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (from Invitrogen) and maintained at 37 °C with 10% CO2. MT4 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Vector Particles Production and Transductions of Cells in Culture— HIV-1-based vectors were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells with the genomic plasmids, an HIV-1 encapsidation plasmid (pCMVΔR8.2) (23Naldini L. Blomer U. Gallay P. Ory D. Mulligan R. Gage F.H. Verma I.M. Trono D. Science. 1996; 272: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (4018) Google Scholar) and a VSV envelope expression plasmid (pHCMV-G) (24Yee J.K. Miyanohara A. LaPorte P. Bouic K. Burns J.C. Friedmann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9564-9568Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were plated at a density of 3.5 × 106 per 100-mm-diameter dish and transfected 16–20 h later. The medium was replaced 8 h after transfection, and the vector supernatants were recovered 36 h later. Non-internalized DNA was removed by treatment of the vector supernatants with DNaseI (1 μg/ml in the presence of 1 μm MgCl2) for 30 min at 37 °C. The amount of p24 present in supernatants was determined by using the HIV-1 p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and, when necessary, vector supernatants were concentrated by using Centricon® YM-50 centrifugal filter devices (Amicon-Millipore) before transduction. MT4 cells were transduced with 200 ng of p24 antigen per 106 cells (an approximate multiplicity of infection of 20) in 35-mm dishes in a 500-μl volume. Two hours post-transduction, the cells were diluted up to a 4-ml volume with supplemented RPMI medium and maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 40 h. Purification, Cloning, and Analysis of HIV-1 Reverse Transcription Products—Reverse transcription products (RTP) were extracted 40 h after transduction by following the method described by Hirt (25Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar): cells were lysed by incubation for 10 min at room temperature in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.6% SDS. High molecular weight DNA was removed by precipitation at a high salt concentration (NaCl 1 m) during 12–18 h on ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 rpm for 1 h, and the supernatants were treated with 100 μg/ml RNaseA for 1 h at 37 °C and 100 μg/ml Proteinase K for 3 h at 50 °C. After phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA was ethanolprecipitated and purified using the NucleoSpin® Extract clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel). The purified double-stranded DNA was digested with DpnI for 2 h at 37 °C prior to PCR amplification (20 cycles) with primers BH and SH (Fig. 1). The amplified product was purified on agarose gel, digested with SacII and BamHI, ligated into an appropriate plasmid vector, and used for transformation of E. coli. Plating on IPTG/X-Gal-containing dishes allowed blue/white screening of recombinant and parental colonies, respectively (10Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15973-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 21Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine the regions where strand transfer occurred, 48 recombinant clones were analyzed by restriction mapping for each assay, as described under “Results.” Estimation of the Frequency of Recombination—For the generation of heterozygous particles, equal amounts of pLac+ and pLac– plasmids were used in the transfection step. Because the same promoter drives the expression of both types of genomic RNAs, and because the regions involved in their dimerization are strictly homologous between lac+ and lac– RNAs, encapsidation of the two genomic RNA moieties is expected to be random. The presence of equivalent amounts of genomic RNAs was confirmed by slot blot analysis on the viral RNA using specific probes for lac+ and lac– RNA (not shown). As currently assumed, the viral population is predicted to be constituted by 25% lac+/+ homozygous vectors, 25% lac–/– homozygous vectors, and 50% heterozygous vectors (lac+/–), according to the Hardy-Weinberg equation (7Onafuwa A. An W. Robson N.D. Telesnitsky A. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4577-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our experimental strategy allows the cloning of products issued from reverse transcription in lac–/– as well as in lac+/– vectors. Assuming that only one double-stranded DNA molecule is produced per each vector particle, one-third of the bacterial colonies will be generated by reverse transcription products issued from lac–/– vectors and will have a white phenotype, introducing a bias in the estimation of the frequency of recombination. Therefore, for the calculation of the frequency of recombination in heterozygous particles, the total number of colonies is multiplied by two-thirds. To accurately estimate the frequency of recombination, another factor to take into account is the background among the white colonies derived from cloning of cellular DNA co-purified with the reverse transcription products. These colonies are distinguished from those issued from the cloning of RTP by the size of the cloned insert and by their restriction pattern. Typically, 48 white colonies are analyzed in each assay and a correction factor is established, given by n/48, where n is the number of colonies resulting from cloning of RTP. In all experiments n corresponded to approximately half of the colonies analyzed. The frequency of recombination (F) is therefore given by F = b/{2/3[N(n/48) + b]}, where N and b are the total number of white and blue colonies, respectively. The recombination rates per nucleotide (f) within a given interval (i) is given by f = F(xi/X)/z, where F is as above, xi is the number of colonies analyzed where recombination was identified to have occurred within the interval considered, X is the total number of colonies on which mapping was performed, and z is the size in nucleotides of the interval. To calculate the frequency of recombination in control samples (“homozygous,” see “Results”), we corrected only for the occurrence of white colonies derived from the cloning of cellular DNA. In Vitro Recombination Assays—In vitro recombination assays were done using the reconstituted system previously developed in our laboratory (21Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). RNA synthesis was performed as previously described (26Negroni M. Ricchetti M. Nouvel P. Buc H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RT purification and activity tests were carried out as described by Canard and colleagues (27Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Constructs used for RNA synthesis were generated following standard cloning procedures. Reverse transcription was carried out on the donor RNA (100 mm) in the presence of an equimolar amount of acceptor RNA after annealing an oligonucleotide specifically onto the donor template. For the experiments with NC (55 amino acids), the protein was added at a ratio of 1 molecule of NC for 8 nt of total RNA, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Reverse transcription was started by the addition of HIV-1 RT at a final concentration of 400 nm and carried out for 60 min. Synthesis of the second DNA strand, BamHI and PstI digestion, ligation, and E. coli transformation were carried out as previously described (21Moumen A. Polomack L. Roques B. Buc H. Negroni M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3814-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombination in HIV-1 after a Single Cycle of Infection—We have developed an experimental system to study HIV-1 copy choice recombination after a single cycle of infection of human cells in culture. VSV envelope-pseudotyped HIV-1 particles are produced by transient co-transfection of the human fibroblast cell line 293T, with two transcomplementation and two genomic plasmids (Fig. 1A). These particles are perfectly equivalent from the standpoint of the structure of the viral capsid and of the reverse transcription process to wild type HIV-1 viruses (28Poznansky M. Lever A. Bergeron L. Haseltine W. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 532-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic plasmids (Fig. 1B) will lead to the synthesis of two types of RNAs (lac+ and lac– RNAs), both containing the sequences required in cis for their dimerization, encapsidation, and reverse transcription. These RNAs contain a region of homology on which recombination is studied. To this aim, we surrounded this region with genetic and biochemical markers different on the two RNAs: a lac+ or lac– marker at the 5′ border and the presence or absence of a BamHI recognition site at the 3′ end (Fig. 1B). The co-transfection procedure leads to the generation of homozygous lac+/+ and lac–/– vectors as well as heterozygous vector lac+/–. To study recombinant products generated in the heterozygous population, the vectors were collected and used to transduce the human T lymphoid cell line MT4. Analysis of the reverse transcription products (RTP) found within these cells provided a snapshot of the recombinant population generated in the absence of any type of selection. Indeed, this approach limits replication to a single cycle, because the RTP carry a non-functional copy of U3 (ΔU3, Fig. 1C), and therefore lack a functional promoter to drive transcription of new genomic RNAs, hampering the generation of viral progeny. The RTP were recovered using the Hirt technique (25Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3351) Google Scholar), which allows isolation of low molecular weight DNA. Because our genomic RNAs were devoid of FLAP sequence, which enhances nuclear import and integration (ΔFLAP, Fig. 1B) (22Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), most RTPs would be present in the unintegrated low molecular weight fraction. The RTP were analyzed after PCR amplification using primers SH and BH, which allowed the simultaneous amplification of parental and recombinant RTP (Fig. 1C). Prior to cloning in E. coli, the amplified products were digested with BamHI, whose target sequence was present only on lac– RNAs, and with SacII, whose recognition site was carried by the SH primer (Fig. 1C). This procedure allows cloning only of parental lac– products and of recombinant lac+ products shown in Fig. 1C. The number of lac+ bacterial colonies over the total number of colonies leads to an estimate of the frequency of recombination, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” For each experiment a control sample was run where homozygous lac+/+ and lac–/– vectors were produced separately by transfection of 293T cells with transcomplementation plasmids and either pLac– or pLac+ genomic plasmids (“homozygous sample,” Table I). In this sample only parental RTP can be generated, and, after restriction with BamHI and SacII, only white bacterial colonies should be found (Fig. 1C). The frequency of blue colonies recovered provides an estimate of the background of artifactual recombinant molecules generated during the experimental procedure.Table IRecombination assays in the four genomic RNAs used in this studySampleExperimentBlueTotalF%C2Homozygous 146750.59259010.55326330.32Heterozygous 17859613.0927052913.2339971913.77DelhpHomozygous 138250.37216210.16317250.14Heterozygous 19710549.2027369410.5239388210.54SLHomozygous 136980.43216390.16334350.69Heterozygous 17655313.7427470110.563859139.312bHomozygous 115030.20225380.37327340.27Heterozygous 16839017.44211163617.4539458016.20 Open table in a new tab The potential problem of carrying over the genomic plasmids used for transfection, inherent to the production of vectors by transient transfection, was considered. In fact these plasmids could then be amplified, and, in the case of pLac–, which contains the BamHI site used for cloning, they could yield white colonies indistinguishable from those issued from transformation with lac– parental RTP. To circumvent this problem, vector preparations were treated with DNaseI before the transduction step, and the RTP preparation was digested with DpnI before PCR. DpnI is a frequent cutter that selectively digests DNA of bacterial origin. Furthermore, amplification products from RTP and from contaminating plasmids yield DNA molecules of different size (Fig. 1D). This difference was exploited to remove potential contaminating products by agarose gel purification prior to restriction with BamHI and SacII. Recombination in the C2 Region of gp120 —We first produced vector particles where the region of homology between the two genomic RNAs was constituted by the 400-nt sequence depicted in Fig. 2A. This sequence spans nt 6,639–7,039 numbered according to HXB2 proviral DNA and includes the portion coding for the C2 region of the gp120 we previously identified as a recombination hot spot in a cell-free system (10Moumen A. Polomack L. Unge T. Veron M. Buc H. Negroni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15973-15982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In three independent experiments the average frequency of recombination was 13.4% (standard deviation: ± 0.4) in “heterozygous” samples, compared with 0.5% (± 0.2) observed in “homozygous” samples (Table I). An extrapolation of this estimate of 0.13 recombination events to the full-length genome (nearly 10,000 nt long in contrast to the 400-nt region used here) predicts 3.25 recombination events per each infection cycle. This value is in agreement with the estimate of three recombination events per infectious cycle made by Jetzt and colleagues (16Jetzt A.E. Yu H. Klarmann G.J. Ron Y. Preston B.D. Dougherty J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The possibility that the recombinant molecules identified were generated during the transfection step was ruled out by a control experiment with C2 RNA where lac–/– viral particles were produced during co-transfection with an equimolar amount of pCDNA3-derived expression vector carrying the cassette containing the viral region of homology and the LacZ′ gene, as in Lac+ plasmids (pCDNA3-vir-Lac+, Fig. 1E). The rationale of this control is that, if artifactual lac+ RNAs were generated through recombination at the DNA or at the RNA level within the producer cells, they would be identified by the presence of blue bacterial colonies after transduction of MT4 cells with these viral particles. The vectors generated in this control sample, together with lac+/+ homozygous particles, were used to co-transduce MT4 cells. This control accounts for artifactual recombination within the producer cells as well as for PCR-driven recombination. The frequency of recombination detected in this control in three independent experiments was 0.37 ± 0.26, a value in the range of the one found in the homozygous samples (Table I), indicating that recombination within the producer cells either at the DNA or at the RNA level does not significantly contribute to the generation of artifactual recombinant molecules. To map the positions of strand transfer along the region of homology, point mutations generating specific restriction sites were introduced in the region of homology either on the donor or on the acceptor RNA, defining sub-regions named R1 to R5 following the sense of minus DNA strand synthesis during reverse transcription (Fig. 2A). This allows determining a recombination rate per nucleotide for each individual region after restriction analysis of the cloned RTP, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Regions R1, R2, and R3 participate in the formation of the hairpin previously identified by in vitro probing (Fig. 2B). Three independent experiments yielded consistent results (Fig. 2C) with the upper part of the C2 hairpin (R2) standing out with respect to the other regions. The recombination rate per nucleotide in R2 was 13.3 × 10–4 (± 2.6 × 10–4), a value significantly higher than those found in the other regions (chi-squared test: p ≤ 0.001). In contrast, when the few blue colonies obtained in the homozygous control samples were analyzed, the distribution of breakpoints appeared random (Table II).Table IIDistribution of breakpoints for C2 RNA in recombinant colonies from the homozygous control s"

The precise mechanism by which OCT4 achieves these diverse biological functions remains unknown. In this report, we identify and characterize 195RKRKR as a nuclear localization signal responsible for its localization in the nuclei and required for the transactivation of its target genes. Point mutations within this motif yielded a mutant that localizes randomly throughout the cells and is defective in transactivating target genes. However, restoration of nuclear localization with a heterologous nuclear localization signal failed to rescue its transactivation function, suggesting that this 195RKRKR motif has additional function in mediating transactivation function. We further demonstrate that this mutant is competent in dimerization with not only itself but also wild type OCT4 and can interfere with the activity of wild type OCT4, thus acting as a dominant negative mutant. Indeed, this mutant can induce the differentiation of P19 cells into trophoblast-like giant cells. These data suggest that this dominant negative form of OCT4 may be a useful tool for modulating the activity of OCT4 in pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem cells to achieve the desired cell types for therapeutic applications.

Stem cells are pluripotent cells capable of producing virtually all cell types in our body, thus possessing great therapeutic potential for many degenerative conditions such as cancer, arthritis, and Parkinson diseases (1Daley G.Q. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Replacement of aged organs with new ones generated through stem cells and bio-engineering would offer enormous hopes for the aging population (1Daley G.Q. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Tumbar T. Guasch G. Cell. 2004; 116: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar, 3Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). However, there are many conceptual as well as technical obstacles associated with the application of stem cells for medical therapies. One of the most critical issues is about the generation and maintenance of stem cells suitable for transplantation and further engineering (1Daley G.Q. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Adult stem cells can be isolated from patients and then transplanted back to the same patients directly upon amplification and engineering without the problem of rejection (4Goh E.L. Ma D. Ming G.L. Song H. J. Hematother. Stem Cell Res. 2003; 12: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, adult stem cells may have limited potential in generating useful cell types, thus offering only restricted uses clinically (3Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 5Rippon H.J. Bishop A.E. Cell Proliferation. 2004; 37: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Embryonic stem cells offer almost unlimited regenerative potential and thus should be able to meet most of the demands clinically (3Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 5Rippon H.J. Bishop A.E. Cell Proliferation. 2004; 37: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Yet problems associated with the availability and host rejection of embryonic stem cells have to be solved before any realistic attempt can be mounted. Nevertheless, stem cell biology and regenerative medicine hold such promise that tremendous efforts are currently devoted to a wide spectrum of investigations both basic and applied to harness the potentials of stem cells. One active area of investigation is the cellular and molecular mechanism controlling stem cell pluripotency (6Donovan P.J. Nat.

Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). OCT4 is a POU domain transcription factor known to regulate stem cell pluripotency (6Donovan P.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 246-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10Niwa H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It is exclusively expressed in preimplantation stage embryos and has become a defining feature for mouse embryonic stem cells (11Scholer H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 12Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Rohdewohld H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). OCT4 deficiency hampers the formation of inner cell mass formation in blastocysts, thus leading to embryonic lethality in mice (10Niwa H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Pesce M. Scholer H.R. Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 14Nichols J. Zevnik B.

As a transcription factor, OCT4 is known to activate a battery of genes (9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Scholer H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P.

Stem Cells. 2001; 19: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), which presumably act to maintain stem cell pluripotency. Although the role of OCT4 in maintaining stem cell pluripotency is not in doubt, few mechanistic details are available regarding the biochemical and cell biological properties of OCT4 in regulating gene expression (9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 10Niwa H. Cell Struct.

To this end, we have analyzed the mechanism through which OCT4 is localized to the nuclei and identified its nuclear localization signal (NLS). 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. We further demonstrate that the ablation of this nuclear localization signal generates a dominant negative mutant for OCT4, which may be a useful tool for the investigation into the role of OCT4 in stem cell pluripotency both in vitro and in vivo. Cell Culture and Reporter Assays—HeLa cells, 293T cells, and P19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 μg/ml antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin, Invitrogen). For reporter assays, HeLa cells or 293T cells were seeded in 12-well cell culture plates and transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods with 0.25 μg of p6wTk-luciferase or pTK-luciferase, 0.25-1.5 μg of pNLS(-)OCT4, 0.25 μg of pOCT4. Transfection efficiencies were normalized with Renilla plasmid (0.01 μg/well, Promega, WI) as internal references, and DNA concentrations were kept constant with empty expression vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured by using Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Transfections of P19 cells were performed by using Effectene transfection regent (Qiagen, CA) according to manual's instruction with 0.25 μg of p6wTk-luciferase or pTK-luciferase, 0.25-2 μg of pNLS(-)OCT4, 0.01 μg of Renilla as internal reference, and pCR3.1 empty vector for DNA concentration normalization. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection as described above. DNA Plasmids and Oligonucleotide Primers—Mouse OCT4 open reading frame was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using high fidelity polymerase Pfx (Invitrogen) from mRNA isolated from P19 cells. The primers used are as follows: OCT4U, 5′-ACC ATG GCT GGA CAC CTG GCT TCA-3′; OCT4L, 5′-ACC CCA AAG CTC CAG GTT CTC TTG TCT-3′. The OCT4 cDNAs were inserted into the SmaI site of modified pCR3.1 for mammalian expression and pET15b for prokaryotic expression as described (15Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8925-8932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). NLS(-) mutant of OCT4 was generated by a PCR-based strategy using two NLS(-) primers as follows: NLS(-)F, 5′-CCA GAGTCG ACA CTA GCA TTG AGA AC-3′; NLS(-)R, 5′-TCG ACT CTG GAT CCG GCC TGC ACC AGG GT-3′. The mutant NLS sequence includes the restriction site for SalI (boldface in primer) to facilitate clone identification. For OCT4 expression without any tag, a stop code “TGA” was added to the ends of OCT4 cDNA before inserting into the expression plasmid. The OCT4 reporter plasmid p6wtk-luciferase and control vector ptk-luciferase were kindly provided by Dr. Hans Scholer. Cell Lysate Preparation and Western Blot Analysis—After transfection (48 h), cells were washed by PBS and lysed on ice by 250 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 10 min and cleared of debris by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. After boiling with an equal volume of 2× SDS loading buffer, cell lysates were electrophoresed through 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted to PVDF membranes (Millipore). The membranes were then blocked in 5% nonfat milk and incubated in anti-FLAG antibody (1:2000, Sigma) or purified rabbit anti-mOCT4 antibody (1:2500). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500, Pierce) were used as 2nd antibody, and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate were used as substrates for final staining. For antigen-blocking experiments, 2 μl of purified anti-OCT4 antibody was preincubated with 100 μg of purified mOCT4 protein (see below) in PBS overnight at 4 °C prior to being used for Western blotting experiments. Expression and Purification of mOCT4 and Preparation of Anti-OCT4 Antibody—The mouse OCT4 cDNA was inserted into a SmaI site in the modified vector pET15b as described (17Nie J. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6758-6762PubMed Google Scholar), which was subsequently introduced into BL21-DE3 for expression. OCT4 expression was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration 1 mm) for 5 h at 37 °C. Under these conditions, OCT4 was produced in an inclusion body. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellet was completely resuspended in 10 ml of 1× equilibration buffer (50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF) per 1 g wet weight and was completely lysed by sonication four times on ice. The resulting inclusion body was separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 1× equilibration buffer containing 1 m urea and then dissolved in 1× equilibration buffer containing 8 m urea. The denatured protein was applied directly to a nickel resin charged and packed according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed under denaturation conditions with column wash buffer (50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 8 m urea) until the A280 of the flow-through fractions fell below 0.05. The bound protein was then eluted successively with 5 column volumes of denatured Elution Buffers (50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 1 mm PMSF, 8 m urea). Eluted fractions were then rapidly diluted to 0.1 mg/ml and dialyzed two times with 2000 ml of PBS buffer (50 mm PBS, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl) for renaturation. OCT4 protein concentration and purity were evaluated by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. For antibody preparation, four rabbits were immunized with purified OCT4 protein (500 mg of protein each rabbit) in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) after preimmunized serum was collected. The rabbits were then boosted three times with mOCT4 protein in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). The titer and specificity of the resulting sera were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using purified OCT4 protein as antigen and by Western blotting against mOCT4 expressed in 293T cells. After a final boost, those sera with high titer and specificity were purified through an affinity column with OCT4 coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipatation—For co-immunoprecipitation, 3 μg of pNLS(-)OCT4 (with GFP and FLAG) or pWTOCT4 (with GFP FLAG) were co-transfected with 3 μg of pWTOCT4 (no GFP, FLAG) or pNLS(-)OCT4 (no GFP, FLAG) to 293T cells cultured in a 10-cm dish by using the calcium phosphate method. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed two times with PBS buffer and lysed by 600 μl of TBE buffer (0 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) plus 10 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cleared cell lysates (40 μl) were saved for direct Western blotting analysis to determine protein expression, and the remaining samples were transferred to a new 1.5-ml tube containing 30 μl of anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) and washed two times in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6,137 mm NaCl) before being rocked overnight at 4 °C. The anti-FLAG beads were then washed three times with TBS buffer. After almost all the TBS was removed, the beads were boiled 5 min in 35 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer (with 5% β-mercaptoethanol) to elute the bound antibodies and antigens. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 3 min, supernatants (10 μl) were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE and then blotted onto PVDF membrane for detection by using affinity-purified OCT4 antibody the 1st antibody and goat anti-rabbit IgG as the 2nd antibody. Immunostaining and Microscopy—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed, processed, stained with antibodies, and scanned by confocal microscopy as described previously (19Cui P. Qin B. Liu N. Pan G. Pei D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Identification of an NLS in mOCT4 Required for Its Transactivation Activity—As a transcription factor, OCT4 must be transported to the nuclei where it binds to its target octamer motif and transactivates its target genes (9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 12Scholer H.R. Dressler G.R. Balling R. Rohdewohld H. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which OCT4 is transported to nuclei remains undefined. We have analyzed the sequence of mouse OCT4 and identified a conserved nuclear localization signal RKRKR at the N-terminal portion of the homeobox domain. To test the possibility that this is the signal responsible for OCT4 localization to the nuclei, we mutated this sequence into GSRVD by site-directed mutagenesis as shown in Fig. 1A. To monitor its localization, we fused the wild type and the mutated OCT4 with GFP at their C termini as shown in Fig. 1A. Upon transfection into HeLa cells, the fusion proteins migrated as a single species around ∼58 kDa by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 3). Confocal analysis of their subcellular localization revealed that the mutant OCT4 is present in a diffuse manner throughout the cells, whereas the wild type OCT4 is localized exclusively in the nuclei (Fig. 1C, l and m versus h and i), suggesting that the RKRKR motif is required for the nuclear localization of OCT4. To confirm this finding further without GFP tagging, we generated a polyclonal antibody against OCT4 expressed in Escherichia coli (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Upon affinity purification against the recombinant protein coupled to agarose beads, the antibody can detect both OCT4 protein with or without the GFP tag (Fig. 2B, lanes 8 and 9). To demonstrate further the specificity of the antibody, we pre-incubated the antibody with the purified OCT4 protein prior to being used for Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, preabsorption of the antibody with the purified OCT4 protein eliminated the signal completely (Fig. 2B, lanes 11 and 12). This antibody was then used to detect OCT4 proteins without any tag. In Fig. 3A, the antibody was able to react specifically with wild type and mutant OCT4 proteins migrating at 44 kDa (lanes 2 and 3). To examine the subcellular localization of the untagged wild type and mutant OCT4 proteins, we expressed both proteins by transfections in HeLa cells and analyzed their cellular localization by immunostaining using the affinity-purified antibody. Confocal images obtained shown in Fig. 3B reveal that wild type OCT4 localizes exclusively in nucleus, whereas mutant OCT4 is in the cytoplasm (g-i versus d-f). To see if nuclear localization is required for OCT4 activity, we analyzed the transcription activities of NLS mutant mOCT4 by using the p6w-luciferase reporter (11Scholer H.R. Ciesiolka T. Gruss P. Cell. 1991; 66: 291-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig 3C, both untagged (lane 7) and tagged (lane 8) NLS mutant mOCT4 failed to transactivate the reporter p6w-luciferase, which contains six copies of octamer motif, whereas the wild type OCT4 is highly active (lanes 5 and 6). However, the transcription activity of wild type mOc4-tagged C-terminally with GFP is significantly lower than that of the untagged form (Fig. 3C, lanes 6 versus 5). Because both the N- and C-terminal domains of mOCT4 have transcription activities (18Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that C-terminally tagged GFPF (where GFPF is GFP tagged with a FLAG (F) tag at its C terminus) may interfere with the function of the C-terminal domain, thus diminishing its activity.Fig. 2Expression of mOCT4 in E. coli and generation of anti-mOCT4 antibodies. A, prokaryotic expression of mOCT4. BL21-DE3 cells harboring His-mOCT4 expression vector (lane 1) was induced to express the recombinant protein (lane 2) by using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Prokaryotic expressed mOCT4 was then purified by using Ni+ affinity chromatography (lane 3). Prokaryotic expressed proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with R-250. B, specificity of anti-OCT4 antibody. Cell lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with control vector (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10), mOCT4 (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11), mOCT4-GFP-F (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12) were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted to PVDF membranes. The proteins were detected by Western blotting using preimmunized serum (lanes 1-3), anti-FLAG antibody (lanes 4-6), affinity-purified anti-mOCT4 antibody (lanes 7-9), or anti-OCT4 antibody preabsorbed with mOCT4 protein (lanes 10-12) as first antibodies and detected with goat anti-mouse (lanes 4-6) or goat anti-rabbit as secondary antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3The ablation of OCT4 NLS blocks its nuclear localization and abolishes its transcription activity. A, Western blot analysis of mouse OCT4 and its NLS(-) mutant. HeLa cells transfected with control vector (lane 1), wild type mOCT4 (wt, lane 2) and NLS(-) mOCT4 (mut., lane 3) were lysed and analyzed by Western blot using anti-OCT4 antibody. B, the NLS mutation is localized in the cytosol. HeLa cells were transfected with wild type OCT4 (a-f) or NLS mutant OCT4 (g-i) and subsequently stained with preimmune serum (a-c), anti-OCT4 antibodies (d-i) first, followed by TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (a-i). The cells were then scanned by confocal microscopy in the fluorescent field (c, f, and i) or bright field (a, d, and g). The signals are combined (b, e, and h) to show that wild type mOCT4 (without GFP and FLAG tag) is localized in the nucleus (e), whereas the NLS mutant is in the cytosol (h). C, the ablation of the NLS destroys its transcription activity. The reporter, p6w-luciferase (0.25 μg each), was co-transfected with control vector (0.25 μg, lane 4), mOCT4 (0.25 μg, lane 5), mOCT4-GFP-F (0.25 μg, lane 6), the NLS mutant (0.25 μg, lane 7), or the NLS mutant OCT4-GFP-F (0.25 μg, lane 8) to HEK293T cells cultured in a 12-well plate. pTK-luciferase (0.25 μg each) was co-transfected with equal volume of control vector (lane 2) or mOCT4 (lane 3) as control. Lane 1 was cell blank with no plasmids transfected. Each transfection was carried out in duplicate, and the luciferase activity was assayed 36 h after transfection by using the dual-reporter assay system as described under “Materials and Methods.” Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection of Renilla plasmids (0.01 μg/well). The DNA plasmid concentrations were normalized by adding appropriate volumes of control vector.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Heterologous NLS Can Rescue the Nuclear Localization but Not the Transcription Activity of NLS Mutant OCT4—The loss of transcription activity for the NLS mutant may be explained by its mislocalization to the cytoplasm as shown in Fig. 3B. If so, restoration of its nuclear localization should rescue its transcription activity. To test this possibility, we fused a known NLS identified in the PSR protein (19Cui P. Qin B. Liu N. Pan G. Pei D. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), RRKKRR, to either the C or N terminus of the mutant OCT4. As shown in Fig. 4A, the fusions produced protein species of the expected size (lanes 3 and 4). Both fusions localized to the nuclei (Fig. 4B, lanes c-f versus a and b), confirming that the heterologous NLS can rescue the localization of mutant OCT4. However, neither fusions possess any transactivation function when co-transfected with the reporter plasmid (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 5 versus 2 and 3), suggesting that the RKRKR motif have a function other than nuclear localization. NLS Mutant OCT4 Behaves as a Dominant Negative Mutant in Suppressing the Activity of Both Exogenous and Endogenous mOCT4 through Dimerization—It had been reported that OCT4 regulates the expression of target genes through dimerization. Therefore, the failure of the NLS mutant OCT4 to activate target genes may be due to its failure to dimerize. To test this possibility, we co-transfected wild type mOCT-GFPF with untagged wild type mOCT4 to 293T cells and then performed co-immunoprecipitations by using anti-FLAG resin and detection with anti-OCT4 antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 5A, untagged mOCT4 (lane 8, lower band) was co-precipitated with mOCT4-GFPF (lane 8, upper band), confirming OCT4 dimerization. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 5B, the NLS mutant mOCT4 can also dimerize (lane 8, upper and lower bands), demonstrating that the mutation in the RKRKR motif did not interfere with the dimerization process. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 5, C and D, heterodimerization between wild type and NLS mutant mOCT4 proteins can be detected (Fig. 5C, lane 8 and D, lane 8). These data demonstrate that the NLS mutation does not affect the dimerization of OCT4. The apparent dimerization between wild type and NLS mutant OCT4 proteins suggests that the NLS mutant may behave as a dominant negative mutant in suppressing the activity of co-expressed wild type OCT4. To test this idea, we co-transfected the NLS mutant with wild type OCT4 in addition to the OCT4 reporter plasmid in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6, the NLS mutant suppressed the activity of wild type OCT4 in a dose-dependent manner, up to ∼50% (lanes 4-9), suggesting that the NLS mutant does behave as a dominant negative mutant. We also co-transfected wild type mOCT4-GFPF with the untagged NLS mutant to see if the NLS mutant affects the nuclear localization of the wild type molecule through dimerization. As shown in Fig. 6B, wild type mOCT4-GFPF when transfected alone into HeLa cells is localized exclusively in the nuclei as expected (d-f) but is shifted to the cytoplasm when co-expressed with untagged NLS mutant mOCT4 (g-i), presumably through dimerization. This observation is consistent with the heterodimerization between wild type and NLS-OCT4 proteins as shown in Fig. 5, C and D. These data also confirm the heterodimerization microscopically. Dominant negative mutants have been useful tools in delineating signaling transduction pathways. The NLS mutant of OCT4 thus may be used to inhibit the activity of endogenous OCT4. To this end, we performed transient co-transfection experiments with NLS mutant mOCT4 and the OCT4 reporter genes in P19 embryonic carcinoma cells. Widely used for differentiation into several cell types, P19 cells express relatively high levels of mOCT4 as demonstrated by Western blotting analysis by using the antibody we developed (Fig. 7A, lane 1) and thus could be a good model for the investigation of OCT4 function. Indeed, endogenous OCT4 activates the OCT4 reporter gene efficiently (Fig. 7B, lanes 2 versus 1). When cotransfected with increased amounts of NLS mutant mOCT4, the luciferase activity activated by endogenous mOCT4 became progressively lower (Fig. 7B, lanes 3-6), approaching ∼70% of inhibition for the endogenous OCT4. Together, we conclude that the NLS mutant OCT4 acts as a dominant negative mutant capable of suppressing the activity of both exogenous and endogenous OCT4. Constitutive Expression of NLS Mutant mOCT4GFPF Leads to Differentiation of P19 Cells—One of the known functions for OCT4 is to regulate stem cell pluripotency in a quantitative manner. Differentiation of P19 cells induced by retinoic acid or Me2SO is accompanied by the reduction of mOCT4 expression. It is possible that these inducers trigger differentiation by down-regulating the levels of OCT4 and/or other related transcription factors (e.g. Nanog) inside the stem cells. To test this possibility, we generated stable cell lines expressing NLS mutant mOCT4-EGFP from P19 cells. Control P19 clones expressing only the GFP gene were also obtained in a similar fashion. As shown in Fig. 8, cells from GFP-transfected colonies (c and d) were similar to parental P19 cells (a and b) in morphology. In contrast, cells expressing NLS mutant mOCT4 (Fig. 8, e and f) have a distinct morphology compared with GFP-transfected or parental cells. In general, the cells expressing NLS mutant mOCT4GFPF grow much larger and become more spread out with expansive cytoplasm (Fig. 8, g and h), a clear sign of differentiation into trophoblastic giant cells. To confirm the differentiated properties, we analyzed the expression of SSEA-1, a marker for stem cell pluripotency, in these transfected cells (Fig. 9). As expected, the pluripotency marker, SSEA-1, was readily detected in P19 parental cells (Fig. 9, a-c) and GFP control-transfected P19 cells (Fig. 9, d-f). On the other hand, the differentiated giant cells expressing NLS mutant OCT4EGFP apparently lost the expression of SSEA-1 as shown by immunostaining (Fig. 9, g-i). These data confirmed that constitutive expression of NLS mutant mOCT4 can induce the differentiation of P19 cells by reducing the function of OCT4.Fig. 9P19 cells that express the NLS mutant lost the expression of SSEA-1. P19 cells (a-c), P19 cells transfected with NLS-GFP (d-f), or the NLS mutant (g-i) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained sequentially with anti-SSEA-1-IgM, biotin-conjugated anti-IgM antibody, and streptavidin-conjugated TRITC. Note that both P19 cells and P19 cells transfected with NLS-GFP express the pluripotent marker SSEA-1 (b and c, and e and f), whereas the P19 cells expressing the NLS mutant mOCT4-GFP-F do not (h and i).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Stem cells have enormous potential in the future of medicine based on their abilities to regenerate virtually all organs and tissues, i.e. pluripotency (2Fuchs E. Tumbar T. Guasch G. Cell. 2004; 116: 769-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). However, the cellular and molecular mechanism controlling stem cell pluripotency remains largely unknown (9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). As a transcription factor, OCT4 has been shown to activate the expression of several downstream genes involved in cell proliferation and differentiation (6Donovan P.J. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 246-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 11Scholer H.R.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 126-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, OCT4 binds to its cognate octamer motif through the cooperation of the POU and homeobox domains and activates downstream genes through transactivation domains located between the N and C termini to the POU/homeobox domains (for review see Ref. 9Pan G.J. Chang Z.Y. Scholer H.R. Pei D. Cell Res. 2002; 12: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that OCT4 is a nuclear protein, the manner in which OCT4 is transported to the nuclei upon synthesis in the cytoplasm remains unclear. Here we report the identification of a nuclear localization signal in the homeobox of the stem cell pluripotency factor OCT4, and we demonstrated that mutation of this motif results in a dominant negative mutant capable of inhibiting OCT4 activity expressed both exogenously and endogenously. Furthermore, we also show that expression of this NLS mutant form leads to differentiation of the pluripotent embryonic carcinoma cell line P19, thus providing a useful tool for the manipulation of stem cell pluripotency and differentiation at the molecular level. The NLS mutant of OCT4 serves as a dominant negative mutant. When co-expressed with wild type OCT4, the NLS mutant can inhibit the activity of wild type OCT4 in a dose-dependent fashion. This dominant negative effect is likely to be mediated through dimerization with the wild type molecule as demonstrated in Fig. 5. However, it is not clear at this moment how the NLS mutant poisons the wild type molecule. Based on data obtained in Fig. 6B, one may conclude that the dominant negative effect is due to the trapping of wild type OCT4 by the NLS mutant in the cytosol, thus preventing it from transactivating its target. Paradoxically, the NLS mutant can be restored as a nuclear protein by the insertion of an unrelated NLS, RRKKRR, at its C or N termini (Fig. 4), whereas these nuclearly restored NLS mutants remain inactive transcriptionally. One potential explanation is that the original mutation changing RKRKR into GSRVD altered the conformation of OCT4 in such a way that it can no longer bind to DNA and mediate transactivation function. Alternatively, this RKRKR motif serves a dual role as an NLS and some unknown function for transactivation. Further studies are required to distinguish these two possibilities. Technically, the ablation of an NLS in a transcription factor may represent a general strategy to generate dominant negative mutants for transcription factors. To our knowledge, this is the first such report that alteration in subcellular localization of a transcription factor results in a dominant negative mutant. Most transcription factors contain a single NLS and thus are readily available for mutagenesis and the generation of a specific dominant negative mutant. These dominant negative mutants would be invaluable tools as we demonstrated in Figs. 8 and 9 for the assignment of biological functions in complex biological processes such as stem cell pluripotency. Further work in vitro and in vivo should allow us to demonstrate the application of this general strategy that allows for the manipulation of biological functions at the molecular level with precision.

https://openalex.org/W2075177078,"In the rd/rd mouse, photoreceptor degeneration is due to a mutation of the rod-specific enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in permanently opened cGMP-gated cation channels in the rod outer segment membrane that allow Na+ and Ca2+ ions to enter the cell, resulting in possibly toxic levels of Ca2+. To identify pathways involved in cell death of the rd/rd rods, we evaluated gene expression in the rd/rd and wild type (wt) mouse retina (U74A oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix)) over the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. 181 genes passed the selection criteria (low standard deviation and high correlation between replicates), falling into six clusters. For any given pair of genes, an expression profile correlation distance and a semantic distance (one for each class of gene ontology terms) were established using newly designed software. Gene expression in rd/rd started to deviate from wt by postnatal day 10. The reduction in photoreceptor-specific genes followed the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. Likewise the increase in transcription factors and apoptosis- and neuroinflammation-specific genes followed the kinetics of the rise in intracellular cGMP in the rod photoreceptors. In addition, genes coding for calcium-binding proteins and those implicated in tissue and vessel remodeling were increased. These results suggest that photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd mouse is a process starting with Ca2+ toxicity followed by secondary insults involving multidestructive pathways such as apoptosis and neuroinflammation, presumably boosting morphological changes. All of these components need to be addressed if rods are to be successfully protected. In the rd/rd mouse, photoreceptor degeneration is due to a mutation of the rod-specific enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase, resulting in permanently opened cGMP-gated cation channels in the rod outer segment membrane that allow Na+ and Ca2+ ions to enter the cell, resulting in possibly toxic levels of Ca2+. To identify pathways involved in cell death of the rd/rd rods, we evaluated gene expression in the rd/rd and wild type (wt) mouse retina (U74A oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix)) over the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. 181 genes passed the selection criteria (low standard deviation and high correlation between replicates), falling into six clusters. For any given pair of genes, an expression profile correlation distance and a semantic distance (one for each class of gene ontology terms) were established using newly designed software. Gene expression in rd/rd started to deviate from wt by postnatal day 10. The reduction in photoreceptor-specific genes followed the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration. Likewise the increase in transcription factors and apoptosis- and neuroinflammation-specific genes followed the kinetics of the rise in intracellular cGMP in the rod photoreceptors. In addition, genes coding for calcium-binding proteins and those implicated in tissue and vessel remodeling were increased. These results suggest that photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd mouse is a process starting with Ca2+ toxicity followed by secondary insults involving multidestructive pathways such as apoptosis and neuroinflammation, presumably boosting morphological changes. All of these components need to be addressed if rods are to be successfully protected. Photoreceptors are very stable but at the same time extremely fragile cells (1Stone J. Maslim J. Valter-Kocsi K. Mervin K. Bowers F. Chu Y. Barnett N. Provis J. Lewis G. Fisher S.K. Bisti S. Gargini C. Cervetto L. Merin S. Peer J. Prog. Retinal Eye Res. 1999; 18: 689-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Photoreceptor degeneration can be caused by any changes that alter the composition of the signal transduction cascade, influence the energy metabolism or the oxygen tension in the outer retina, or disturb the phagocytic process by the retinal pigment epithelium. In the rd/rd mouse, photoreceptor degeneration is due to an autosomal recessive mutation of the enzyme cGMP phosphodiesterase, which is an important component in the phototransduction cascade (2Farber D.B. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 263-275PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic defect is due to the integration of a provirus (Xmv-28) into intron I of the β subunit of the enzyme and subsequent incorrect splicing (3Bowes C. Li T. Frankel W.N. Danciger M. Coffin J.M. Applebury M.L. Farber D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2955-2959Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Degeneration starts at about P8, 1The abbreviations used are: P, postnatal day; wt, wild type; LEL, log-transformed expression level; Avg, average; C1q, complement factor 1q; GO, gene ontology.1The abbreviations used are: P, postnatal day; wt, wild type; LEL, log-transformed expression level; Avg, average; C1q, complement factor 1q; GO, gene ontology. which is the time point at which naturally occurring cell death starts in the wild type mouse (4Lolley R.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 4182-4191PubMed Google Scholar), and commences very quickly. The resulting lack in cGMP phosphodiesterase activity causes a dramatic increase in cytoplasmic cGMP concentration (5Farber D.B. Lolley R.N. Science. 1974; 186: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This in turn results in permanent opening of the cGMP-gated cation channels in the photoreceptor membrane, allowing the excessive entry of extracellular ions, particularly calcium. It has been suggested that this increase in intracellular calcium causes a metabolic overload of the cells, eventually leading to cell death by apoptosis (6Chang G.Q. Hao Y. Wong F. Neuron. 1993; 11: 595-605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Likewise it has been suggested that either disruption of the phototransduction cascade or its continued activation can lead to photoreceptor degeneration in humans (e.g. Refs. 7Rosenfeld P.J.

With the advent of genomic technology, transgenic and double knock-out mice have been generated to determine which genes are involved in causing or preventing photoreceptor cell death in the rd/rd mouse (e.g. Refs. 9Hafezi F.

In addition, drug studies have been designed to identify factors that could delay or interfere with photoreceptor degeneration (e.g. Refs. 12LaVail M.M. Yasumura D. Matthes M.T. Lau-Villacorta C. Unoki K. Sung C.H. Steinberg R.H. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 592-602PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ahuja P. Caffe A.R. Holmqvist I. Soderpalm A.K. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. van Veen T.

Med. 1999; 5: 1183-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), immunohistochemical analyses have been performed to describe changes in protein expression in the rd/rd retina (16Doonan F. Donovan M. Cotter T.G. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5723-5731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kim D.H. Kim J.A. Choi J.S. Joo C.K. Ophthalmic Res. 2002; 34: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and calcium-induced cell death in a photoreceptor culture model has been studied to unravel the apoptotic pathway (64Sharma A.K. Rohrer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35564-35572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, a clear picture has yet to emerge that describes the apoptotic pathways involved in photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd mouse. To obtain a more complete view of potential pathways involved in cell death of the rd/rd mouse photoreceptors we evaluated gene expression over the known time course of photoreceptor degeneration in the rd/rd and wild type mouse retina. Our results indicate that the rd gene-triggered cell death alters the expression of genes involved in diverse cellular pathways including calcium homeostasis, catabolism, neuroinflammation, and tissue remodeling. Temporal gene expression profiles are discussed in the context of the cGMP and calcium accumulation and photoreceptor cell death kinetics. To conclude, a hypothetical transcriptional network is proposed that will require further validation in the future. These studies adhered to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research as well as the Medical University of South Carolina regulations for the use of animals in medical research. C57BL/6 mice (wild type (wt)) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN); the rd/rd mouse strain (on a C57BL/6 background) was a generous gift from Dr. Debora Farber (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). Animals were bred on homozygous backgrounds and raised in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle with unlimited access to food and water. All chemicals used in this study were at least molecular biology grade material and purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted. Age-matched wt and rd/rd animals (P6, P10, P14, P17, and P21) were sacrificed by decapitation, and retinas were quickly isolated and stored in RNAlater (Ambion) at –20 °C. Retinas from four animals per geno-type per time point were pooled, and each data point was obtained in duplicate. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by a clean-up using RNeasy minicolumns (Qiagen). The quality of the RNA was examined by gel electrophoresis (to visualize the quantity and integrity of the 18 and 28 S ribosomal RNA bands) and spectrophotometry (accepting a 260/280 ratio of 1.95–2.1). Sample preparation for microarray hybridization was carried out as described in the Affymetrix Expression Analysis Technical Manual with minor modifications. Five micrograms of total RNA were used to generate double-stranded cDNA (Invitrogen), which was purified using phase lock gel columns (Eppendorf) followed by ethanol precipitation. The purified cDNA served as a template for the generation of biotinylated cRNA using the BioArray™ HighYield™ RNA transcript labeling kit (ENZO Diagnostics). The labeled probes were purified using the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen), fragmented (8 mol/liter Na+-citrate buffer), and stored at –80 °C. The length of the cRNA and fragmentation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. U74A oligonucleotide arrays (Affymetrix) containing ∼6,000 genes (all sequences contained in the Mouse UniGene data base, Build 74) and ∼6,000 expressed sequence tag clusters were used in this study. Hybridization with equal amounts of labeled cRNA (15 μg/array) and readout were performed by the DNA Microarray Core Facility at the Medical University of South Carolina using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station. Gene chips were scanned using the Affymetrix scanner (Microarray Suite 5.0 software) to obtain probe level data. Outputs were scaled to a target intensity of 250. The raw Affymetrix data (absolute expression level and perfect match values) were normalized using a quantile normalization method, and gene expression levels were obtained using the positional dependent-nearest neighbor model, which integrates probe sequence information for estimating probe binding affinities to the target sequences on microarrays (18Zhang L. Miles M.F. Aldape K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Parameters for filtering the differentially expressed genes are presented under “Results.” All algorithms and computations referred to in this section were implemented (or have already been implemented) in Matlab (Version 6.5), including its Statistics Toolbox. A complete description of the implementation of tools and the link to the program can be obtained from the author (65Pinto F.R. Rohrer B. Cowart A. Almeida J. Bioinformatics. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Hierarchical Clustering—The mouse gene set was clustered by gene expression profiles. The distance between gene profiles was defined by the correlation distance. Hierarchical clustering was performed using unweighted pair-group average linkage (19Everitt B.S. Dunn G. Applied Multivariate Data Analysis. 2nd Ed. Arnold Publishing, London2001: 125-158Google Scholar). The resulting dendrogram was divided into separate clusters. The cutting points were searched by identifying peaks in the distances between adjacent genes in the dendrogram order. Five multipeaks were identified and smoothed with a 3-point moving average. Gene Ontology (GO) Annotations—The annotations for the mouse genome and the relation scheme between the GO terms used were obtained at the GO Consortium site (Gene Ontology Consortium 2000, www.geneontology.org). Annotations for molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components were used separately. Computation of Semantic Distances—The three annotation categories of function, process, and cell location were used. The following description of the procedure is valid for the three classes, and the procedure was repeated for each one of them independently. The fact that the terms are interrelated enables the direct calculation of a distance measure between each two terms. A measure based in information theory concepts, called semantic distance, was used. This measure was previously defined and discussed (20Lord P.W. Stevens R.D. Brass A. Goble C.A. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2003; : 601-612PubMed Google Scholar) and is briefly described. For each two terms it is possible to find parent terms in common. From these, the most specific one is chosen. The semantic distance value between two terms is as high as the difference between the specificity of the common parent term and of the two child terms. The specificity of a term is measured by the information content of that term and defined as follows,I(termi)=−log(pi)eq.1 where pi is the frequency of genes annotated with the term i, or with child terms of the term i, in the genome. The semantic dissimilarity is then calculated as follows,SD(termi,termj)=[I(termi)+I(termj)]−2×max[I(parent_termk)]eq.2 where k varies between 1 and the number of ancestral common nodes of the two terms i and j. Thus, the distance of interest is between two genes, not between two terms, and this distance can only be calculated when each of the two genes has an annotation with at least one term. In the case of a gene having an annotation with more than one term, all the possible distances between the terms of each gene are calculated with the final ontological distance being defined by the minimum value obtained (i.e. having the shortest path in the ontology graph). Attribution of Colors to GO Terms—The list of all the unique GO terms used to annotate the selected set of genes for which the semantic term pairwise distance had been determined was sorted by hierarchical clustering using unweighted pair-group average. This way similar terms should be close to each other in the dendrogram order (with the exception being the ones at the edge of each cluster), which consequently will have similar colors. These colors are then used to graphically represent the distribution of GO terms across different expression profiles. Computation of GO Clustering Coefficients—With the aim of detecting in an objective way groups of genes that were similarly expressed and at the same time were similarly annotated, GO clustering coefficients were computed (i.e. local correlation coefficients). Statistical significance of the local correlation coefficients for each gene was evaluated by bootstrapping. Over-represented GO Terms—GO terms that appeared to be over-represented in this set of 181 genes when compared with their frequency in the entire mouse genome were further examined by χ2 and binomial testing for significant deviation (21Daniel W.W. Biostatistics: a Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences. John Wiley & Sons, New York1999: 600-606Google Scholar). The selected genes had to have a p value lower than 0.05 for at least one of the tests, and if they only achieved that value for one of the tests, the other p value should not be higher than 0.075. This double test strategy was a way to overcome the possible flaws of the χ2 test for low expected frequencies and other situations where the binomial test assumptions were not completely valid. It should be noted that the binomial test uses the “term frequency in the genome” as a constant characteristic of the entire population, but some term frequencies could be biased because some areas of biology are more intensively studied than others. Additionally the binomial test is ideally applied when one takes finite samples from an infinite population; this is not the case here, but samples can be comparable if the sample size (181 in this case) is small when compared with the finite population size (∼12,500 probe sets on the array). From the set of terms that were considered significantly over-represented, only the ones that appeared in more than five genes (of the 181 set) were subsequently analyzed. The kinetics of photoreceptor degeneration, cGMP accumulation, and changes in gene expression for select clusters was analyzed. Outer nuclear layer thickness in the rd/rd mouse retina was fitted with an exponential decline (22Clarke G. Collins R.A. Leavitt B.R. Andrews D.F. Hayden M.R. Lumsden C.J. McInnes R.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), whereas cGMP accumulation, which rises quickly between P6 and P14 (5Farber D.B. Lolley R.N. Science. 1974; 186: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), could be fitted with a single exponential. Gene clusters were analyzed with the same two equations. The same RNA samples that were used to generate the biotinylated cRNA were also used for real time PCR. Equal amounts of RNA (1 μg) were used in reverse transcription reactions (Invitrogen). PCR amplifications were conducted using the QuantiTect Syber Green PCR kit (Qiagen) with 0.2 μmol/liter forward and reverse primers (see Table I for primer sequences, gene accession numbers, and expected lengths; each primer was designed to span an intron) and equal amounts of complimentary DNA (1 μl of 1:10 dilutions). Reactions were treated with 0.01 unit/μl AmpErase® uracil-N-glycosylase enzyme (Applied Biosystems) to prevent carryover contamination. Real time PCR was performed in triplicate in a GeneAmp® 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 94 °C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, and 58 °C for 1 min. Quantitative values were obtained by the cycle number (Ct value) (i.e. by using the point at which fluorescence starts to increase above background and therefore at a fixed threshold level (set at 0.15 relative fluorescence units)), which is inversely proportional to the amount of a specific mRNA species in the tissue sample from which the cDNA was derived. Relative gene expression levels were calculated using the equation y = (1 + AE)ΔΔCt where AE is the amplification efficiency of the target gene (set at 1.0 for all calculations), and ΔΔCt is the difference between the mean experimental and control ΔCt values. The ΔCt value is the difference between the Ct value for a retina-associated gene and the β-actin internal reference control gene (23Mitas M. Mikhitarian K. Walters C. Baron P.L. Elliott B.M.

We therefore chose to assay gene expression in the retina of rd/rd mice from postnatal day 6 (2 days prior to the onset of retinal degeneration) through postnatal day 21 (the time point when the majority of the photoreceptors have been eliminated, and relatively little reorganization in the inner retina has occurred) (24Strettoi E. Porciatti V. Falsini B. Pignatelli V. Rossi C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5492-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in steps of 3–4 days. Normalization of Data—To extract gene expression levels from microarray data we used a recently developed model, called the positional dependent-nearest neighbor model. This model takes into account that hybridization on the microarrays is affected by the stacking energy of the nearest neighboring base pairs and the microarray surface. It has been demonstrated that this approach gives more precise and accurate expression estimates than the conventional alternatives (18Zhang L. Miles M.F. Aldape K.D. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The identification of differentially expressed genes is based on the variance structure of the expression data and the reproducibility of gene expression profiles. Fig. 1A shows the S.D. of the log-transformed expression levels (LELs) plotted against the LEL average (Avg(LEL)) for each gene on the arrays. Fig. 1B shows the correlation of LEL profiles between replicates against the Avg(LELs). There seems to be a trend that better correlations are observed with higher LELs. At the lower end (Avg(LEL) < 5.5), the median of the correlation coefficients is below zero, indicating poor reproducibility due to gene expression values below detection threshold. Very good correlations were observed for genes with S.D.(LEL) < 0.45 as shown in Fig. 1C. Therefore, we adopted the following criteria to identify differentially expressed genes: Avg(LEL) > 5.5; S.D.(LEL) < 0.45; and correlation between replicates, >0.80; from these criteria a list of 181 genes was produced. Hierarchical Clustering—Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with the expression profiles of the 181 genes (Fig. 2D; see also supplemental material, data and cluster assignment, which lists genes and their correlation distances). The clustering tree shows that the samples fall into three clusters: one consisting of young animals (irrespective of genotype), the second one of wt mice older than P10, and the final one of rd/rd animals older than P10. The tight correlation between P6 wt and rd/rd mice indicates that there is no large scale expression difference between the two genotypes prior to the onset of β phosphodiesterase expression and the start of photoreceptor cell death (see also Fig. 3). The somewhat closer correlation of older rd/rd mice with young animals (P6) reflects the dominance of photoreceptor genes in the retina. As rod photoreceptors outnumber all other retinal cells combined by 3.5:1 in the mouse retina (25Jeon C.J. Strettoi E. Masland R.H. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8936-8946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is not surprising that samples lacking the majority of rod-specific genes (i.e. retina at P6, which is prior to final photoreceptor differentiation) and those that lose the majority of their rods (older rd/rd mice) would cluster together. Although samples from the same age and phenotype are tightly clustered, one or two samples show less consistency than the others when replicate samples are compared (e.g. P10C57–1 and P14RD-2).Fig. 3Functional analysis. The six clusters identified in Fig. 2B were further characterized in terms of expression levels over time (diagrams, average ± S.D.) and function (biological process terms, pie charts). Please note that the color assignment is not identical to that in Fig. 2C2 as the assignment between categories would not be sufficiently different.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cluster Assignment—The hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 2D) demonstrated that the genes show a striking modular behavior. To determine the number and size of the modules, the distance between adjacent genes in the dendrogram was plotted using a 3-point moving average. The resulting peaks defined the separation between clusters (Fig. 2B). However, the peaks separating the clusters may include genes and not just separate the clusters (e.g. peak between clusters 3 and 4). Broad peaks contain genes with large distances to all of their neighbors that make their automated classification highly sensitive to the clustering threshold considered. Four genes were found under these conditions (genes 95–98) and consequently were manually associated with cluster 3. Using this procedure, six clusters were identified: cluster 1, genes 1–69 (in the dendrogram order); cluster 2, genes 70–79; cluster 3, genes 80–98; cluster 4, genes 99–115; cluster 5, genes 116–155; and cluster 6, genes 156–181 (see also Fig. 3 and supplemental material, data and cluster assignment, for further analysis of the clusters). Gene Ontology—The GO terms available for all the genes on the U74A arrays were used to classify the genes in the six clusters. Color schemes were built to identify the GO terms based on molecular function, biological process, and cellular component (Fig. 2, C1, C2, and C3, right-hand color bars, respectively; see supplemental material, legend lists, for a list of GO terms used). The color coding allows for evaluation of clusters that are dominated by particular colors (i.e. dark blue for phototransduction in biological processes (Fig. 2, C2 and see A2 for legend)). However, due to the large number of annotation terms required for GO, the resulting figures are time-consuming to interpret. Thus, we set out to determine whether genes with similar annotation cluster together according to their expression profiles. For any given pair of genes, an expression profile correlation distance and a semantic distance (one for each class of GO terms) was established. The semantic distance expresses the degree of dissimilarity between the terms with dissimilarity being based on the distance between two terms within a tree of terms (directed acyclic graph). Therefore, the genes of interest are the ones for which small expression profile distances are associated with small semantic distances. The results of this analysis demonstrated that the clustering varied significantly based both on which class of GO terms was used for the analysis and which cluster was analyzed (Fig. 2, C1–C3, left-hand color bars, see legend for GO clustering p values at the bottom; see also supplemental material, data and cluster assignment). For example, in the molecular function category of cluster 1 (Fig. 2C1), the GO term clustering method detected a significant number of calcium-binding proteins (light green; n = 9, p < 0.001); however, they participate in different biological processes (Fig. 2C2) and are localized to different cellular compartments (Fig. 2C3). In cluster 5, 17 vision-related genes were identified by analyzing the biological processes category (dark blue; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C2). As expected, these genes did not cluster based on molecular function or cellular compartment. In other words, the GO clustering p values for the vision-related terms in cluster 5 were correlated (red) in the biological processes category but dispersed (green) in both the molecular function and cellular component categories. Cluster 6 was found to be the most consistent. GO clustering p values in all three categories revealed clustered genes. This cluster contains mostly genes involved in cell cycle and development, such as transcription factors and cell cycle proteins, which are co-localized in the nucleus and serve similar molecular functions (see supplemental material, data and cluster assignment). Yet these genes were part of different categories when analyzed in terms of the classical gene ontology method (comparing color codes of the right-hand columns among those genes with low p values (red genes)). Taken together, our results suggest that a combined analysis for the three terms is both useful and necessary to identify co-regulated genes. Temporal Analysis—The clusters isolated in our analysis identified significantly different time-dependent expression patterns (Fig. 3). As shown by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 2D), at P6 there is no difference between the genotypes in any of the clusters, whereas by P10 (or possibly earlier if time points with smaller intervals had been chosen) clusters revealed time-dependent changes: up-regulated at all age points beyond P6 in the rd/rd retina (clusters 1 and 3), up-regulated in the rd/rd retina at P10 but not later in development (cluster 2), down-regulated in the rd/rd retina (clusters 4 and 5), and not different betwee"

These complexes link together critical pathways thereby conferring selectivity to the cellular responses to second messengers that regulate the activity and/or trafficking of these proteins. Adaptor proteins appear central to the assembly and stability of these protein complexes. In the kidney, the sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1, 1The abbreviations used are: NHERF, sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor; NHE3, Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; TMA-Cl, (tetramethylammonium chloride; EIPA, ethyl isopropylamiloride; MES, 4-morpho-lineethanesulfonic acid; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein. 1The abbreviations used are: NHERF, sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor; NHE3, Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; TMA-Cl, (tetramethylammonium chloride; EIPA, ethyl isopropylamiloride; MES, 4-morpho-lineethanesulfonic acid; PTH, phenylthiohydantoin; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein. also called EBP50) and NHERF-2 (also called E3KARP, TKA1) were initially identified as proteins required for cAMP-associated phosphorylation and inhibition of the renal brush border membrane Na+-H+ exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) (8Weinman E.J.

NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 are adaptor proteins that share a common modular structure including two tandem PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) protein interactive domains and a C-terminal ezrin-radixin-moesin-merlin (MERM) binding domain. Since their discovery, nearly 50 proteins have been identified that bind to the NHERF isoforms (11Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J. Shenolikar S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6309-6314Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). More recently, other PDZ proteins such as PDZK1 (NaPi-Cap1) have been found to be present in renal tubules and to interact with many of the same proteins that bind NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 (12Custer M. Spindler B. Verrey F. Murer H. Biber J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F801-F806PubMed Google Scholar). NHERF-1, NHERF-2, and PDZK1 have the capacity not only to self-associate but also to heterodimerize with one another (13Shenolikar S. Minkoff C.M. Steplock D. Chuckeree C. Liu M-Z. Weinman E.J.

Given their location in the renal proximal convoluted tubule, the concept emerged that these adaptor proteins form an apical/subapical mesh or scaffold that regulates the activity and trafficking of target proteins. We, as well as others, have speculated that NHERF-1, NHERF-2, and PDZK1 may represent a redundant physiologic control mechanism for regulation of renal ion transport and receptor activity based on studies in heterologous expression systems (10Yun C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 11Voltz J.W. Weinman E.J.

Evidence has begun to emerge, however, suggesting that there are unique specificities for some target proteins with individual adaptor proteins. Initially, it was reported that calcium-mediated endocytosis of NHE3 in OK cells, a renal proximal tubule cell line, required NHERF-2 and that the presence of endogenous NHERF-1 was not sufficient (17Kim J.H. Lee-Kwon W. Park J.B. Ryu S.H. Yun C.H. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23714-23724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Further support for more specific interactions between NHERF-1, NHERF-2, and PDZK1, and given target proteins emerged from study of NHERF-1 knockout mice and two sets of observations were of particular interest with respect to the present studies (18Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). First, although both NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 supported cAMP regulation of Na+-H+ exchange activity when co-expressed with NHE3 in PS120 fibroblast cells, NHE3 activity assayed in isolated renal brush border membrane vesicles from NHERF-1-/- mice was not inhibited in response to activation of protein kinase A despite the presence of normal amounts of NHERF-2 and PDZK1 (10Yun C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 19Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Second, whereas in vitro and cell experiments have indicated that Npt2a binds to NHERF-1, NHERF-2, and PDZK1, the NHERF-1-/- mice demonstrate increased urinary excretion of phosphate associated with decreased expression of Npt2a (NaPi IIa), the major regulated renal sodium-dependent phosphate transporter in the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells (18Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 20Gisler S.M. Stagljar I. Traebert M. Bacic D.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11957-11962Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Moreover, the NHERF-1-/- mice fail to fully adapt to restriction of the dietary intake of phosphate although the abundance of PDZK1 but not NHERF-2 is increased (22Weinman E.J. Boddeti A. Cunningham R. Akom M. Wang F. Wang Y. Liu J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. Wade J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1225-F1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These experiments highlight the fact that conclusions about the specificity of interactions between NHERF-1, NHERF-2, or PDZK1 and specific renal transporters derived from in vitro, yeast, and cell expression studies require complimentary studies in native tissues. Unfortunately, pursuing the mechanisms underlying the abnormal regulation of NHE3 by PTH and of Npt2a by alterations in the dietary intake of phosphate in intact animals is difficult and many of the molecular and pharmacologic probes used to dissect specific pathways cannot be used in whole animals. We reasoned, therefore, that the development of primary cultures of mouse proximal tubules would provide a useful system to detail the role of not only the NHERF proteins but also, potentially, might be applicable to the study of renal tissue from other knockout animals. In this article, we describe methods to isolate and study mice primary renal proximal tubule cells in culture that expresses NHE3 and Npt2a, and retain selected regulatory responses including inhibition of NHE3 activity by PTH and forskolin. NHE3 activity in proximal tubule cells from NHERF-1-/- mice, on the other hand, failed to demonstrate inhibition in response to forskolin or PTH indicating that this form of hormonal control of NHE3 activity requires NHERF-1. This conclusion was confirmed by the observations that the inhibitory response to PTH was restored by transiently expressing NHERF-1 in the NHERF-1-/- cells using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer. In like manner, it has been assumed but not clearly established that the physiologic mechanisms that mediate the response to alterations in the phosphate content of the media bathing cultured cells are equivalent to those operative in modulating renal phosphate transport when the dietary intake of phosphate is altered. By contrast to NHERF-1+/+ cells that increase sodium-dependent phosphate transport and Npt2a expression in response to low phosphate media, the NHERF-1-/- cells fail to adapt to the low phosphate media. This indicates clearly that the phosphate regulatory defect is within the proximal tubules themselves and is not the consequence of systemic changes in hormones, vitamin levels, or other factors. Animals and Preparation of Renal Proximal Tubule Cells—Male NHERF-1 (-/-) mice (B6.129-Slc9a3r1tmSsl/Ss1) breed into a C57BL/6 background for 6 generations and parental wild-type inbred control C57BL/6 mice aged 12 to 16 weeks were used in the current experiments (18Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To prepare primary renal proximal tubule cell cultures, kidney cortices were dissected and minced, and digested using 1% Worthington collagenase Type II and 0.25% soybean trypsin inhibitor. On completion of digestion, the samples were re-suspended in 35 ml of 45% Percoll® and centrifuged at 26,891 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Proximal tubule cells sedimented to a layer immediately above the red-cell pellet. The 5-10-ml layer containing the proximal tubule cells was aspirated, centrifuged, washed to remove the remaining Percoll®, and re-suspended in 6 to 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 50 units/ml of penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.5 μm hydrocortisone, 0.87 μm bovine insulin, 50 μm prostaglandin E1, 50 nm sodium selenite, 50 μg/ml human transferrin, and 5 pm 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine. The proximal tubule cells were plated on Matrigel-coated coverslips or plastic cell culture dishes coated with Matrigel, and maintained in an incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cultures were left undisturbed for 36 h after which the media was replaced every 2 days until the cells achieved confluence. Transport Assays—Na+-H+ exchange activity was determined using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM) (10Yun C. Oh S. Zizak M. Steplock D. Tsao S. Tse C. Weinman E.J. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3010-3015Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 6 μm BCECF-AM in a sodium assay buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaPO4, 25 mm glucose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 20 min at room temperature. They were then pulsed with 40 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.4, for 15-20 min followed by sequential washes with a solution containing 130 mm (tetramethylammonium chloride (TMA-Cl), 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm TMA-PO4, 25 mm glucose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. BCECF fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelengths of 500 and 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. The NH4Cl pulse was targeted to achieve an initial pHi of 6.0 and only cells with initial pHi values between 6.0 and 6.2 were included for analysis. Na+-H+ exchange transport, expressed as ΔpHi/s, was calculated from the slope of the initial 5 to 10 s of sodium-dependent pHi recovery. Over this time period, the relation between pHi and time was essentially linear. In some cases, cells were pretreated with 10-4m forskolin or 10-7m PTH-(1-34) (rat-PTH) during the final 15 min of dye loading and continuously during the perfusion. Control cells were treated with Me2SO, the diluent for forskolin. At the end of each experiment, the cells were equilibrated in pH clamp media containing 20 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, 110 mm KCl, 14 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm TMA, 25 mm glucose, and 10 μm nigericin at pH 6.1 and 7.2. Control and experimental measurements were made on cells from the same proximal tubule cell preparation and were assayed on the same day. Phosphate transport was measured by determination of the sodium-dependent uptake of radiolabeled phosphate (23Lederer E.D. Khundmiri S.J. Weinman E.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephol. 2003; 14: 1711-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Twenty-four to 72 h prior to study, the cells were incubated in low (0.3 mm) or high (1.9 mm) phosphate media. The cells were washed in serum-free medium, followed by incubation in a transport medium containing 137 mm NaCl or 137 mm TMA-Cl, 5.4 mm KCl, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 0.1 mm KH2PO4. Phosphate uptake was initiated by the addition of transport medium containing 32P-radiolabeled orthophosphate. Uptake was continued for 10 min at room temperature, after which the cell were washed with ice-cold medium in which TMA-Cl was substituted for sodium chloride, 32P was omitted, and 0.5 mm sodium arsenate was added. The uptake of 32P from the TMA-Cl solution was used to determine sodium-independent uptake and was subtracted to yield the sodium-dependent uptake of 32P. The cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for 90 min at 4 °C and an aliquot analyzed by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. Each assay was performed in triplicate and averaged to provide a single data point. Other Methods—The production of intracellular cAMP in cultured cells in response to 10-7m PTH and 10-4m forskolin was measured by non-acetylation EIA (cAMP Biotrak Assay Kit, Amersham) in the presence of 0.4 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Protein kinase C (PKC) activity was assayed using the SignaTECT™ PKC Assay System form Promega containing a specific PKC substrate and capture membrane. The results of the PKC assays were confirmed by Western immunoblotting using PKCα, phospho-PKC (pan), and phospho-PKC α/βII antibodies. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde and prepared for confocal microscopy as previously described (18Shenolikar S. Voltz J.W. Minkoff C.M. Wade J.B. Weinman E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11470-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To obtain membrane preparations from the cultured cells, the cells were washed with sterile ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, detached by scraping, and centrifuged for 5 min at 800 × g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet re-suspended in 1.5 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cells were then disrupted by three 20-s bursts from a probe sonicator followed by a 10-min centrifugation at 1,000 × g to remove large particulates. This supernatant was ultra-centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The pellet was then re-suspended in 0.1% SDS and prepared for electrophoresis by the addition of Laemmli buffer. Western immunoblotting was performed using antibodies specific for NHERF-1, NHERF-2, ezrin, PDKZ1, Npt2a, NHE3, and green fluorescent protein (GFP). Infective recombinant adenoviruses were produced using AdEasy (Stratagene), a commercially available system adapted from methods originally developed by He et al. (24He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were produced by inserting the cDNA into a shuttle plasmid (pShuttleCMV) and performing homologous recombination in Escherichia coli with this shuttle vector and a large adenovirus-containing plasmid following electroporation. Recombinants were identified from single colonies and infective adenovirus virions were produced following transfection of the linearized recombinant adenovirus plasmid in HEK293 cells. Virus stocks were amplified in HEK293 cells on 15-cm plates and purified following lysis by CsCl banding using ultracentrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR using appropriate primers was used to detect NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3 (9Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Extraction of DNA and Northern blots was performed as previously described (22Weinman E.J. Boddeti A. Cunningham R. Akom M. Wang F. Wang Y. Liu J. Steplock D. Shenolikar S. Wade J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1225-F1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Statistical comparisons were performed using Peritz analysis of variance (26Harper J.F. Comput. Biol. Med. 1984; 14: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). An enriched suspension of proximal convoluted tubules was obtained using gradient centrifugation following protocols previously described by Mandel and co-workers and modified by our laboratories (27Soltoff S.P. Mandel L.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 84: 643-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Dolson G.M. Hise M.K. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: F409-F416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We plated the suspended tubules on culture dishes for biochemical and phosphate transport experiments or on glass coverslips for NHE3 assays. Plating of cells on basement membrane matrix (Matrigel) increased the viability of the cells and was used in most experiments. The cells remained relatively quiescent for several days immediately following plating and any attempts to change media or otherwise manipulate the cells resulted in decreased viability. Accordingly, the cells were left undisturbed for 3 to 4 days before changing the media after which the media was changed every other day till the cells were ready for study. Attempts to pass cells that had achieved confluence were unsuccessful. Confluent or near confluent cultures contained a uniform cell type although in every culture, there were clusters of cells with a different morphology. We estimated that these other cells constituted 5% or less of the total population of cells. As will be discussed, we did not attempt to identify this minority population of cells because it would be unlikely that they would express the two transporters of interest in this study, namely NHE3 and Npt2a. Assays for cAMP and protein kinase C activity were used to characterize the response to PTH. In wild-type cells, PTH (10-7m) stimulated cAMP generation 33.3 ± 8.4-fold and protein kinase C activity by 34.4 ± 6.2%. In NHERF-1 null proximal tubule cells, PTH (10-7m) stimulated cAMP generation 33.8 ± 7.2-fold and protein kinase C activity by 37.6 ± 6.1%. There were no differences between wild-type and knockout cells (Table I). In many of the above experiments, cAMP generation in response to vasopressin (10-7m) was also examined. The effect of vasopressin was variable but always severalfold lower than the response to PTH (data not shown).Table IThe effect of PTH (10−7m) on cAMP generation and protein kinase C activity in cultured proximal tubule cells from wild-type and NHERF-1−/− cellscAMP generationProtein kinase C activityWild-type cells33.3 ± 8.4aIndicates p < 0.05. n = number of preparations studied.

Open table in a new tab Reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblotting indicated that the cultured cells expressed NHE1 and NHE2 in addition to NHE3. Accordingly, we next determined the Na+-H+ exchange activity in wild-type and NHERF-1 null proximal tubule cells, and the response to 50 nm ethyl isopropylamiloride (EIPA), a concentration that would inhibit NHE1 and NHE2 activity but not affect NHE3 activity (29Park K. Olschowka J.A. Richardson L.A. Bookstein C. Chang E.B. Melvin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G470-G478PubMed Google Scholar). Na+-H+ exchange averaged 0.044 ± 0.002 ΔpHi/s and 0.042 ± 0.02 in the absence and presence of 50 nm EIPA in wild-type cells and 0.042 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s and 0.039 ± 0.004 in the absence or presence of 50 nm EIPA in null cells. In both cell types, 50 μm EIPA abolished sodium-dependent pHi recovery. In all remaining experiments, 50 nm EIPA was included in the perfusion solutions to permit specific study of NHE3 activity. NHERF-1 facilitates the formation of a multiprotein signal complex that phosphorylates NHE3 and down-regulates its activity (30Zizak M. Lamprecht G. Steplock D. Tariq N. Shenolikar S. Donowitz M. Yun C. Weinman E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24753-24758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 31Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Donowitz M. Shenolikar S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6123-6129Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To determine whether cultured proximal tubules retain this regulatory pathway, wild-type proximal tubule cells were treated with forskolin and sodium-dependent pHi recovery was measured in the presence of 50 nm EIPA. Forskolin inhibited NHE3 activity by 34.7 ± 3.2% (p < 0.05, n = 7) in wild-type cells but failed to inhibit NHE3 activity (-4.2 ± 3.5%, n = 7) in cultured proximal tubule cells from NHERF-1-/- mice although basal NHE3 activity was similar in both cell types (0.041 ± 0.004 ΔpHi/s in wild-type cells and 0.045 ± 0.003 in NHERF-1 null cells). Recombinant adenovirus-NHERF-1 containing an enhanced GFP tag at the N terminus was used to determine whether we could rescue the null cells. Preliminary studies in PS120 cells indicated that expressed N-terminal GFP-tagged NHERF-1 was fully functional in mediating cAMP inhibition of co-expressed NHE3. We initially infected wild-type cells with various concentrations of adenovirus-GFP or adenovirus-GFPNHERF-1. For both viruses, 109 plaque-forming units were found to result in preserved cell morphology. Comparison of fluorescent labeled cells with bright field images indicated the efficiency of expression of NHERF-1 was 99% or greater at these concentrations of virus particles. The efficiency of infection can also be appreciated in Fig. 1, which shows representative confocal images of NHERF-1-/- cells stained for NHERF-2. The panels on the left (A and C) are non-infected cells showing the presence of native NHERF-2 (panel C) but no green fluorescence (panel A). Panels B and D show cells infected with adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1. There is clear expression of NHERF-1 as seen in panel B with no change in expression of NHERF-2 (panel D). Moreover, comparison of panels D and B indicate that virtually all NHERF-2 positive cells in this field are expressing NHERF-1. We next wanted to determine whether the expressed NHERF-1 was present in the plasma membrane. Fig. 2 (panel A) shows a Western immunoblot of a membrane preparation from NHERF-1-/- cultured renal proximal tubule cells infected with adenovirus-GFP or adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1. A band of ∼85 kDa representing the GFPNHERF-1 fusion protein is displayed using an anti-GFP antibody in the plasma membrane of adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1-infected cells but not in cells infected with adenovirus-GFP. This band was also recognized using an anti-NHERF-1 antibody (data not shown). Fig. 2, panel B, shows immunoblots for ezrin, NHE3, NHERF-2, and PDZK1 indicating that the membrane expression of these proteins was not affected by expression of NHERF-1 in the NHERF-1-/- proximal tubule cells. Adenovirus-GFP infection of wild-type cells did not affect basal, or forskolin- or PTH-mediated inhibition of NHE3 activity (Table II). Adenovirus-GFP infection of NHERF-1 null proximal tubule cells also did not affect basal NHE3 activity and the cells remained unresponsive to forskolin or PTH. Infection of the NHERF-1 null cells with adenovirus-GFP-NHERF-1, however, restored the inhibitory effect of forskolin and PTH to cells derived from null animals.

https://openalex.org/W2101763835,"In a previous characterization of the ABCA subfamily of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, we identified potential protein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation sites, which are conserved in eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of the ABCA transporters (Peelman, F., Labeur, C., Vanloo, B., Roosbeek, S., Devaud, C., Duverger, N., Denefle, P., Rosier, M., Vandekerckhove, J., and Rosseneu, M. (2003) J. Mol. Biol. 325, 259-274). These phosphorylation residues are located in the conserved cytoplamic R1 and R2 domains, downstream of the nucleotide binding domains NBD1 and NBD2. To study the possible regulation of the ABCA1 transporter by CK2, we expressed the recombinant cytoplasmic domains of ABCA1, NBD1+R1 and NBD2+R2. We demonstrated that in vitro ABCA1 NBD1+R1, and not NBD2+R2, is phosphorylated by CK2, and we identified Thr-1242, Thr-1243, and Ser-1255 as the phosphorylated residues in the R1 domain by mass spectrometry. We further investigated the functional significance of the threonine and serine phosphorylation sites in NBD1 by site-directed mutagenesis of the entire ABCA1 followed by transfection into Hek-293 Tet-Off cells. The ABCA1 flippase activity, apolipoprotein AI and AII binding, and cellular phospholipid and cholesterol efflux were enhanced by mutations preventing CK2 phosphorylation of the threonine and serine residues. This was confirmed by the effect of specific protein kinase CK2 inhibitors upon the activity of wild type and mutant ABCA1 in transfected Hek-293 Tet-Off cells. The activities of the mutants mimicking threonine phosphorylation were close to that of wild type ABCA1. Our data, therefore, suggest that besides protein kinase A and C, protein kinase CK2 might play an important role in vivo in regulating the function and transport activity of ABCA1 and possibly of other members of the ABCA subfamily. In a previous characterization of the ABCA subfamily of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, we identified potential protein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylation sites, which are conserved in eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of the ABCA transporters (Peelman, F., Labeur, C., Vanloo, B., Roosbeek, S., Devaud, C., Duverger, N., Denefle, P., Rosier, M., Vandekerckhove, J., and Rosseneu, M.

Kaminski W.E. Curr. Atheroscler. Rep. 2002; 4: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Several studies link ABCA1 mutations to impaired cellular cholesterol and phospholipid efflux characteristic of Tangier disease and high density lipoprotein-deficiency patients (3Brooks-Wilson A.

Expression of WT and mutant ABCA1 in cultured cells demonstrated the correlation between the level of expression and activity of the ABCA1 transporter, the extent of binding to the apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) acceptor and the efflux of cellular lipid (6Chen W. Sun Y. Welch C. Gorelik A. Leventhal A.R. Tabas I. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43564-43569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Human ABC transporters consist of a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD), which binds and hydrolyzes ATP, and of a membrane-spanning domain through which the substrate is translocated (7Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar, 8Holland I.B. Blight M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 381-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Besides these elements, regulatory domains with putative phosphorylation sites were described in several human transporters (7Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). We carried out an extensive analysis of the subfamily A of the ABC transporters and showed that this subfamily consists of 13 human ABCA and of many eukaryotic and prokaryotic ABCA homologues (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Multiple alignments of the subfamily A transporters demonstrated the high degree of sequence conservation and the particular topology of this subfamily. In the ABCA subfamily, the intracellular N-terminal residues are followed by a first transmembrane helix, by a long extracellular loop, and by a downstream cluster of five transmembrane helices separated by short loops. The transmembrane domain is followed by a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain NBD1 and by a downstream sequence of 80 conserved residues. In the full ABCA transporters, which have a high internal symmetry, these elements are repeated in the second half of the transporter (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among the human transporters of the ABCA subfamily, mutations in ABCA1 have been linked to Tangier disease, whereas mutations in ABCA2 impair the transport of retinyldiene and cause retinal degeneration (9Dean M. Hamon Y. Chimini G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both transporters, mutations in the nucleotide binding domains decrease the ATPase activity and thereby impair the transport activity of the mutants. Point mutations in the ABCA1 and ABCA2 extracellular loops probably affect the three-dimensional structure of the transporters and decrease their association with acceptor proteins required for substrate export (10Allikmets R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 793-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The 80-residue segments downstream of the NBDs are conserved in the eukaryotic ABCAs and in the prokaryotic subfamily 7 precursors (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In ABCA1 none of the natural mutations causing either Tangier disease or familial hypo-α-lipoproteinemia occur in these sequences, although one of the Tangier mutations is located close to this domain (11Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the conserved sequences downstream of the NBDs is still unknown; they might have a regulatory function, as proposed for other transporters (12Winter M.C. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 294-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A or C has been demonstrated for several ABC transporters, including cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (13Picciotto M.R. Cohn J.A. Bertuzzi G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 37368-37374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase 2 (CK2) and PKA in the ABCA1-PEST sequence, threonine 1286 and 1305, respectively, are constitutively phosphorylated and protect ABCA1 against calpain-mediated degradation. PKA and CK2 inhibitors did not, however, alter phosphorylation of these residues. Among the kinases, protein kinase 2 or CK2 is a constitutively active Ser/Thr protein kinase essential for cell viability (18Sarno S. Moro S. Meggio F. Zagotto G. Dal Ben D. Ghisellini P. Battistutta R. Zanotti G. Pinna L.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2002; 93: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). CK2 can target at least 200 proteins (19Litchfield D.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar) and is implicated in a wide variety of cellular functions such as tRNA and rRNA synthesis, apoptosis. and cell survival and transformation (20Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The CK2 phosphoacceptor sites consist of clusters of acidic residues located mostly downstream from phosphorylatable seryl or threonyl residues. Prediction of consensus sequence motives in human ABCA1 using PROSITE identified 39 potential CK2 phosphorylation sites in ABCA1. Among these, the 1242TTLEE and 2211TTLDQ motives within the 80-residue R1 and R2 domains, downstream of, respectively, NBD1 and NBD2, were conserved in most members of the human ABCA subfamily (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Another potential CK2 phosphorylation site, 1255SGVD, is conserved in ABCA4, ABCA6-10, and ABCA12 but is absent in all NBD2s. Thus, it is conceivable that modulation of the ABCA1 transport activity might occur through serine or threonine phosphorylation by protein kinase CK2. In this report we demonstrate that in vitro the NBD1+R1 and not the NBD2+R2 domain of ABCA1 is phosphorylated by CK2, and we used mass spectrometric methods to directly identify Thr-1242, Thr-1243, and Ser-1255 as the phosphorylated residues. We further investigated the functional significance of these CK2 phosphorylation sites in NBD1+R1 by site-directed mutagenesis of ABCA1. The ABCA1 flippase activity, the transporter ability to bind apolipoproteins AI and AII and to induce cellular phospholipid and cholesterol efflux, were enhanced by mutations preventing phosphorylation at that site. The specific CK2 inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole and apigenin also enhanced the activity of ABCA1 transfected into Hek-293 Tet-Off cells, thus confirming the effect of the mutations. Our data, therefore, suggest that besides PKA and PKC, protein kinase CK2 might play an important role in vivo in regulating the function and transport activity of ABCA1 and possibly other members of the ABCA subfamily. Materials—Tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, barium hydroxide, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid were from Sigma.

The CK2 inhibitor 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole was a gift of Dr. Shugar (Poland), Apigenin in Me2SO was purchased from Sigma. Construction of the Expression Vectors—For expression of the His-NBD1+R1 domain between residues 861 and 1306 and of His-NBD2+R2 between residues 1877 and 2232, vectors were constructed using the pET28a plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI). DNA fragments encoding the protein sequences were PCR-amplified and cloned into the pET28a vector, and mutant plasmids were made by overlapping PCR. WT and mutant plasmids were checked by sequencing and by restriction analysis. A bidirectional pBI-ABCA1/GFP vector encoding a hemagglutinin-tagged ABCA1/GFP fusion protein (23Rigot V. Hamon Y.

The SplI/SplI fragment (nucleotides 3626-4535) was inserted into the SplI site of a pMCS5 vector (Molecular Biologische Technologie). Mutagenesis was performed by standard PCR, and mutated SplI fragments were transferred back into the SplI-digested pBI-ABCA1/GFP vector. All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. Expression and Purification of Soluble Recombinant His-NBD1+R1 and His-NBD2+R2 in E. coli—The length of the NBD1+R1 and NBD2+R2 constructs were selected to obtain soluble recombinant proteins and to avoid expression in the E. coli inclusion bodies (24Roosbeek S. Caster H. Zhou Liu Q. Berne P.F. Duverger N. Christiaens B. Vandekerckhove J. Peelman F. Labeur C. Rosseneu M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Proteins were expressed in transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS E. coli grown in LB medium (Invitrogen) under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. Cells were centrifuged at 9000 × g for 10 min, washed with PBS, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin), and sonicated on ice 3 × 5 min at 60 watts. Both His-NBD1+R1 and His-NBD2+R2 were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni-PROBOND™ column. The column was equilibrated in a 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol (v:v), 10 mm imidazole and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the cell lysate. Stepwise elution with 100 mm imidazole eliminated E. coli protein contaminants, whereas the His-NBD+R proteins eluted at 500 mm imidazole. The eluate was desalted on a HiTrap-Sepharose column and stored either at 4 °C or -80 °C. Sample purity was checked by 12% SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Recombinant CK2 and its α- and β-subunits were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to homogeneity (25Filhol O. Cochet C. Wedegaertner P. Gill G.N. Chambaz E.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11133-11140Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For electrophoretic experiments, 2 or 8 μg of recombinant NBD1+R1, NBD2+R2, or mutants were incubated at 22 °C with either [γ-32P]ATP or 10 μm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 in the presence of 0.3 μg of oligomeric CK2 or 1.0 μg of CK2α. The phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and autoradiography after 15 min. For mass spectrometric analysis, recombinant NBD+R proteins were incubated with CK2 for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 0.2 mm ATP. The reaction was terminated by 5 min of boiling and drying the samples. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Phosphopeptides—Purified NBD+R proteins before and after treatment with CK2 were subjected to reduction with an excess of dithiothreitol, alkylation using iodoacetamide, and digestion with trypsin. To obtain the corresponding alkene moiety from the phosphate esters, the β-elimination reaction was optimized and simplified by incubating the peptide mixture in 5 m Ba(OH)2 at 37 °C for 90 min under nitrogen. Solid carbonic dioxide was then added to eliminate the precipitated barium carbonate, which was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min (26Amoresano A. Cirulli C. Quemeneur E. Marino G. Eur. J. Mass Spectrom. 2004; 10: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectra were recorded using a Applied Biosystem Voyager DE-PRO instrument operating in reflector mode. A mixture of the analyte and of α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in acetonitrile, ethyl alcohol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1:1, v/v/v) was applied to the metal sample plate and dried under vacuum. Mass calibration was performed with insulin at 5734.5 Da and a matrix peak at 379.3 Da as internal standards. Raw data were analyzed by using computer software provided by the manufacturer and reported as average masses. Cell Cultures—Hek-293 Tet-off cells were cultured in DMEM media plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, and Geneticin on 12-well plates coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were transfected for 24 h with the GFP-ABCA1 constructs using a mixture of polyethyleneimine and DNA at a 2/1 polyethyleneimine/DNA charge ratio and subsequently grown for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 1 min with 500 μl of trypsin (Invitrogen). After the addition of 1 ml of PBS, 1% FBS and 0.5 mm EDTA, cells were filtered and kept on ice for flow cytometry. The percentage of transfected cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis on a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm. Measurement of the ABCA1 Flippase Activity—Mock- and ABCA1-transfected Hek-293 Tet-Off cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min with 5 μm NBD lipid, washed with PBS at 4 °C, and incubated with 64 μm sodium dithionite in a Tris-HCl buffer, pH 10, for 5 min at 4 °C. The fluorescence intensity of the NBD probe before (Imax) and after (Iq) dithionite quenching was measured on a Bio-Tek FLX 800 microplate reader with excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm, respectively. Percent quenching was calculated as (Imax - Iq)/(Imax) × 100. Similar measurements were performed in the presence of 50 μm 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzotriazole and apigenin CK2 inhibitors on Mock-transfected and Hek-293 cells transfected with WT ABCA1 and with the T1242A, T1243A, T1242A/T1243A, and T1242D/T1243D ABCA1 mutants. Monitoring of ApoAI and -AII Binding to Hek-293 Tet-Off Cells—After transfection with WT ABCA1, cells were washed twice with a 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 150 mm NaCl and incubated with carboxyrhodamine-labeled recombinant apoAI or -AII at concentrations between 0 and 50 μg/ml for 1 h at 4 °C to monitor extent of binding. In subsequent experiments cells transfected with WT and mutant ABCA1 were incubated with 20 μg/ml apoAI or -AII for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were detached by mild trypsinization for 2 min at 37 °C using 0.05 g/liter trypsin in PBS and kept on ice, and flow cytometric recordings were performed. Cells were subdivided into three populations as a function of their level of ABCAI expression, reflected by the GFP fluorescence intensity. Apoprotein binding data were calculated for each cell population based upon the mean carboxyrhodamine fluorescence intensity (27Chambenoit O. Hamon Y. Marguet D. Rigneault H. Rosseneu M. Chimini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9955-9960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Phospholipid and Cholesterol Efflux to ApoAI and ApoAII Induced by ABCA1—Phospholipid and cholesterol efflux were measured using both radioactivity and fluorescence. For radioactive measurements, Hek-293 Tet-Off cells transfected with WT and mutant ABCA1 were washed twice with DMEM and incubated either with 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]choline or [3H]cholesterol in DMEM plus 2.5% FBS. After 24 h cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated with 1 ml of DMEM plus 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with DMEM and incubated at 37 °C with 20 μg/ml recombinant apoAI for 4 h for [methyl-3H]choline efflux or 6 h for [3H]cholesterol efflux. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged for 10 min at 810 × g. 500 μl of supernatant was transferred into 5 ml of scintillation liquid (Optiphase Hisafe 3). Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 1 ml of NaOH (0.1 n). 500 μl of cell suspension was transferred into 5 ml of scintillation liquid (Optiphase Hisafe 3). 3H counts per minute (cpm) were measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409), and % lipid efflux was calculated as (cpm in supernatant/(cpm in supernatant + cpm in cells)) × 100. For measurements using fluorescence, Hek-293 Tet-Off cells transfected with WT and mutant ABC-A1 were labeled with either 5 μm NBD phospholipid or 2.5 μm NBD cholesterol for 45 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 3 times with 1 ml of PBS and incubated with 500 μl of DMEM containing either 20 μg/ml recombinant apoAI or 40 μg/ml apoAII. Efflux was measured either after 4 h of incubation at 37 °C for NBD phospholipids or after 6 h for NBD cholesterol by measuring NBD fluorescence intensity. Percentage efflux was calculated as ((Icontrol - IapoAI)/Icontrol) × 100. Confocal Microscopy—Cellular localization of the expressed ABCA1 WT and mutants was analyzed by confocal microscopy using GFP fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of, respectively, 488 and 509 nm. Hek-293 Tet-Off cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated Lab-Tek® German borosilicate confocal microscope slides at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/chamber in 400 μl in DMEM plus 10% FBS, transfected, grown for 48 h in DMEM plus 10% FBS and washed twice with PBS. Cells were incubated with 25 μg/ml concanavalin A Alexa fluor 633, an endoplasmic reticulum-specific fluorescence dye, for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS, and the Alexa fluor 633 fluorescence was measured using the excitation and emission wavelengths of, respectively, 632 and 647 nm. ABCA1 Half-life Measurement—To determine the half-life of WT and mutant ABCA1, the transporter flippase activity was measured as a function of time in transfected Hek-293 Tet-Off cells, which were treated with 100 ng/ml doxycycline to stop transcription of the ABCA1 constructs (28Cheng H.H.

The ABCA1 flippase activity for phosphatidylethanolamine was measured as described above using NBD PE after 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. The half-life was estimated from half the total activity decay (28Cheng H.H. Xu L. Kumagai H. Simoni R.D. J. Biol.

Identification of Protein Kinase CK2 Phosphorylation Sites on ABCA1—Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the N-terminal half of ABCA1, consisting of a membrane-spanning domain made of six helices followed by the cytoplasmic NBD and the regulatory R domain. The C-terminal half of ABCA1 has an identical topology (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Among the 39 potential CK2 phosphorylation sites predicted by PROSITE in ABCA1, we focused upon those located in NBD1, NBD2, and in the conserved downstream R1 and R2 domains (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Eight potential CK2 sites are predicted within the cytoplasmic NBD1+R1 domain between residues 861 and 1306. One site at 989TVEE is in NBD1, whereas three sites at 1242TTLE, 1243TLEE, and 1255SGVD are located in the R1 domain. By comparison, seven CK2 sites are predicted between the C-terminal residues 1877-2232, four of which are in NBD2 and two, 2211TTLD and 2225SDDD, are in the R2 domain. We examined the conservation of the human ABCA1 Thr-1242, Thr-1243, and Ser-1255 residues in ABCA sequences of other species (Fig. 1). As previously reported for other transporters of the ABCA family (1Peelman F. Labeur C. Vanloo B. Roosbeek S. Devaud C. Duverger N. Denefle P. Rosier M. Vandekerckhove J. Rosseneu M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the threonine residues are better conserved in the N-terminal R1 compared with the R2 domain, whereas Ser-1255 is conserved only in mammalian ABCA. To investigate the in vitro phosphorylation properties of the ABCA1 cytoplasmic domains, we expressed the NBD+R domains in E. coli and used the purified recombinant proteins as substrates for protein kinase CK2 assays in vitro using both the CK2 holoenzyme or its isolated α catalytic subunit. Fig. 2 shows that only ABCA1 NBD1+R1 and not NBD2+R2 is phosphorylated in vitro by CK2. Interestingly, only the CK2 holoenzyme but not its α-subunit was able to phosphorylate the NBD1+R1 substrate, indicating that the presence of the CK2β regulatory subunit is required for efficient phosphorylation. As the 1242TTLE, 1243TLEE, and 1255SGVD are the best conserved potential CK2 phosphorylation sites in NBD1, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis at these positions both in the recombinant NBD1+R1 protein and in the entire ABCA1 construct. In both systems we engineered several mutants designed at preventing phosphorylation by mutation either of the target threonines and serine,"

PCC7942. We have shown previously that the light-harvesting phycobilisomes diffuse quite rapidly on the thylakoid membrane surface. However, the photosystem II core complexes appear completely immobile. This raises the possibility that all of the membrane integral protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane are locked into a rather rigid array. Alternatively, it is possible that photosystem II is specifically anchored in the membrane, with other membrane proteins able to diffuse around it. We have now resolved this question by studying the diffusion of a second integral membrane protein, the IsiA chlorophyll-binding protein. IsiA is induced under iron starvation and some other stress conditions. In iron-stressed cyanobacterial cells, a high proportion of chlorophyll fluorescence comes from IsiA. This makes it straightforward to examine the diffusion of IsiA by FRAP. We find that the complex is mobile with a mean diffusion coefficient of ∼3 × 10–11 cm2 s–1. Thus it is clear that some thylakoid membrane proteins are mobile and that there must be a specific anchor that prevents photosystem II diffusion. We discuss the implications for the structure and function of the cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane.

We discuss the implications for the structure and function of the cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane. In plants and cyanobacteria the light reactions of photosynthesis are mediated by protein complexes in the thylakoid membranes. Considerable information is now available on the structure and function of these complexes (1Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N.

Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2872) Google Scholar). A full understanding of thylakoid membrane function will also require knowledge of the dynamics of the membrane in vivo. The diffusion of proteins in the thylakoid membrane is likely to play a crucial role in processes including photosynthetic electron transport, the regulation of photosynthesis, and the assembly and turnover of the photosynthetic complexes (4Kirchhoff H. Mukherjee U. Galla H.-J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4872-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Allen J.F. Forsberg J.

PCC7942 (Synechococcus 7942) as a model system for investigating thylakoid membrane dynamics in vivo (7Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol.

Our technique of choice is fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), 1The abbreviations used are: FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; PSI, photosystem I; PSII, photosystem II. which can be used to observe the diffusion of fluorescently tagged membrane components. A laser-scanning confocal microscope is used to bleach fluorescence in a small region of the cell, and the subsequent changes in the bleaching pattern give quantitative information on the diffusion of the fluorophore (10Kubitscheck U. Wedekind P. Peters R. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 948-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Mullineaux C.W. Sarcina M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 237-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Synechococcus 7942 has a simple, regular thylakoid membrane organization that makes it ideal for such studies (11Mullineaux C.W. Sarcina M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 237-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and we have developed a one-dimensional variant of FRAP that has enabled us to measure the diffusion of several thylakoid membrane components in vivo (11Mullineaux C.W.

Our previous FRAP studies have shown the mobility of some thylakoid membrane components, including a fluorescently tagged lipid analogue (8Sarcina M. Murata N. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the light-harvesting phycobilisomes, which diffuse rather rapidly on the membrane surface (7Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Aspinwall C.L. Sarcina M. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth.

We have looked previously at the diffusion of only one integral membrane protein complex. This is the photosystem II reaction center, which is amenable to FRAP measurements because its chlorophylls fluoresce significantly at room temperature. Surprisingly, photosystem II appears completely immobile even over long time scales (7Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), a situation that is very unusual for a membrane protein (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Two explanations, outlined below, are possible. The first possibility is that photosystem II is specifically anchored in the membrane. In eukaryotic plasma membranes this situation can arise because of the binding of membrane proteins to components of the cytoskeleton (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes it is more plausible that photosystem II is rendered immobile by oligomerization into rows of PSII dimers (15Olive J. Ajlani G. Astier C. Recouvreur M. Vernotte C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 275-282Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and/or because of the presence of a large domain in the thylakoid lumen (16Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). The lumen appears to be an extremely crowded environment (17Albertsson P.-A.̊. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and, thus, it is possible that protein diffusion in the lumen is greatly restricted. A second possibility would be that all of the integral membrane protein complexes in the thylakoid membrane are locked into a rather rigid array. Such a situation would be very different from that normally found in eukaryotic plasma membranes (10Kubitscheck U. Wedekind P. Peters R. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 948-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, thylakoid membranes have a different lipid composition and an exceptionally high ratio of protein to lipid (18Szalontai B. Nishiyama Y. Gombos Z. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membrane lipids are mobile, although their diffusion is slower than that typically found in eukaryotic plasma membranes (8Sarcina M. Murata N. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The lipids could, however, be percolating through a rigid matrix of proteins. In the present study we resolve this question by observing the diffusion of a second integral membrane thylakoid protein. This is the IsiA protein, which is induced under iron starvation or under oxidative stress conditions (19Michel K.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). IsiA (also called CP43′) is a chlorophyll-binding protein whose sequence shows some similarity with that of the CP43 protein of photosystem II (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). During iron deficiency this protein is expressed at a high level and is present in the cells in at least two forms. Some IsiA appears to be free in the membrane, where it may act as a chlorophyll reservoir (19Michel K.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Some IsiA is bound to photosystem I as a ring of IsiA subunits surrounding the photosystem I trimer (21Boekema E.J. Hifney A. Yakushevska A.E. Piotrowski M. Keegstra W. Berry S. Michel K.P. Pistorius E.K. Kruip J. Nature. 2001; 412: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The association of IsiA with photosystem II is also a possibility, because there is evidence that IsiA can quench excess PSII excitation (23Sandström S. Park Y.I. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IsiA is characterized by strong chlorophyll fluorescence at ∼680–685 nm (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 21Boekema E.J. Hifney A. Yakushevska A.E. Piotrowski M. Keegstra W. Berry S. Michel K.P. Pistorius E.K. Kruip J.

Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), most of which is likely to come from the IsiA that is free in the membrane. The fluorescence of the IsiA that is bound to photosystem I is strongly quenched by efficient energy transfer to the chlorophylls of the photosystem I core complex (22Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 24Andrizhiyevskaya E.G. Schwabe T.M.E. Germano M. D'Haene S. Kruip J. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The high fluorescence from IsiA makes it amenable to FRAP studies. Here we show that at least the highly fluorescent pool of IsiA is freely mobile in the membrane. We discuss the implications for thylakoid membrane structure and function. Growth of Cells—Wild-type cells of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 were grown in BG11 medium (25Castenholz R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 68-93Crossref Scopus (350) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 mm NaHCO3. Liquid cultures were grown in an orbital shaking incubator at 30 °C with white illumination at ∼10 microeinsteins m–2 s–1. To induce IsiA expression, cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed and inoculated in iron-free BG11 medium. Liquid cultures were grown for at least 8–10 days under iron limitation (26Sandström S. Ivanov A.G. Park Y.I. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 116: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Spectroscopy—Optical absorption spectra were recorded at room temperature with an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer LS50 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a red-sensitive photomultiplier. Chlorophyll excitation was at 435 nm, and the excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. Room temperature fluorescence spectra were recorded using cell suspensions at a chlorophyll concentration of 2–3 μm in 3-ml cuvettes. Spectra were normalized to the optical density of the cell suspension at 750 nm. Low temperature fluorescence spectra were recorded at 77 K using a liquid nitrogen sample holder. Cell suspensions at a chlorophyll concentration of 2–3 μm were injected into quartz capillary tubes (internal diameter 2.5 mm) and frozen by dropping them into liquid nitrogen. 77 K spectra were normalized to the PSI emission peak because their absolute amplitudes are unreliable. Oxygen evolution was measured at 30 °C in a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Oxylab2 from Hansatech, King's Lynn, UK) with saturating illumination from an array of red light-emitting diodes. Cell densities were estimated from optical density at 750 nm measured in a Unicam UV2 spectrophotometer (Unicam, Cambridge, UK). The estimate was calibrated using a hemacytometer. Chlorophyll a concentrations were determined from methanol extracts using the extinction coefficient of Porra et al. (27Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedeman P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4743) Google Scholar) FRAP Measurements—FRAP experiments were carried out using a Nikon PCM2000 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 50 milliwatt argon laser. The 457-nm laser line was selected using a 475-nm dichroic mirror. A 60× oil immersion objective lens was used with a 50-μm confocal pinhole. Fluorescence emission was selected with a Schott RG665 red glass filter transmitting light of wavelengths longer than ∼665 nm. Cell suspensions were immobilized by adsorption onto 1.5% agar made up in growth medium. Blocks of agar were then placed in a laboratory-built, water-jacketed sample holder with a 0.2-mm glass coverslip pressed onto the agar surface. The sample temperature was maintained at 30 °C using a circulating water bath. Cells were imaged by scanning the confocal spot in the xy plane in a window of 20.5 × 20.5 μm. Elongated cells aligned in the y direction were selected for FRAP measurements. After recording a prebleach image, the microscope was switched to the x scanning mode, and the confocal spot was scanned in the x direction for 3–4 s to bleach a line across the cell. A series of images was then recorded (typically at 15-s intervals). Data Analysis—Images were analyzed using Scion Image software (Scion Corporation, Frederick, Maryland). A one-dimensional bleaching profile along the long axis of the cell was extracted integrating across the cell in the x direction for every point on the y axis (11Mullineaux C.W. Sarcina M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 237-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R.

The baseline fluorescence from the unbleached cell was subtracted, and the bleaching profile was then fitted to a Gaussian curve using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific) to obtain a measurement of the bleach depth. Diffusion coefficients were obtained by plotting maximum bleach depth versus time using a one-dimensional diffusion equation as described previously (11Mullineaux C.W. Sarcina M. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 237-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R.

Expression of IsiA—IsiA expression can be induced by iron starvation and typically results in a blue shift of the chlorophyll Qy absorption band accompanied by greatly increased fluorescence at 680–685 nm (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Sandström S. Ivanov A.G. Park Y.I. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 116: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After 8 days of iron starvation we observed a shift in the chlorophyll Qy absorption band from 680 to 672 nm (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 compares room temperature fluorescence spectra from iron-starved and iron-replete cells. The excitation wavelength is 435 nm, and emission spectra are normalized on the basis of cell density. In iron-replete cells, the main emission peak comes from the chlorophylls of PSII at ∼684 nm. Iron starvation results in greatly increased chlorophyll fluorescence per cell and a slight blue shift in the emission maximum from 684 to 680 nm (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 compares 77 K fluorescence emission spectra for iron-stressed and iron-replete cells. In iron-replete cells, the main emission comes from PSII (685–695 nm) and PSI (about 715 nm). In the iron-stressed cells, emission is dominated by the peak at 685 nm (Fig. 3). These effects are characteristic of the induction of IsiA expression in Synechococcus 7942 (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 26Sandström S. Ivanov A.G. Park Y.I. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Physiol. Plant. 2002; 116: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is clear from Fig. 2 that, at room temperature with chlorophyll excitation, most fluorescence comes from PSII in iron-replete cells but from IsiA in iron-stressed cells. Prolonged iron starvation leads to loss of the phycobilisomes and eventually to bleaching of the cells (19Michel K.-P. Pistorius E.K. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). However, at the stage when we used them, our iron-stressed cells retained normal levels of chlorophylls and carotenoids (Fig. 1). The cellular content of phycobilisomes (indicated by the phycocyanin absorption peak at 625 nm) was slightly reduced after iron stress, but the cells retained significant levels of phycobilisomes (Fig. 1).Fig. 2Fluorescence emission spectra for cell suspensions of Synechococcus 7942 at room temperature with chlorophyll excitation (435 nm).

Spectra have been normalized to long-wavelength emission (mainly from PSI) at 725 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Photosynthetic Performance of Iron-stressed Cells—To assess whether the iron-stressed cells retained normal photosynthetic function, we measured the light-saturated rate of oxygen evolution. Expressing oxygen evolution on a per cell basis, the rates were 7.5 fmol of O2 per cell per hour for iron-stressed cells and 10.8 fmol of O2 per cell per hour for iron-replete cells. Therefore, the iron-stressed cells retained significant levels of whole-chain photosynthetic electron transport, although their performance was a little lower than that of the iron-replete cells. FRAP Measurements on Iron-replete Cells—In iron-replete cyanobacterial cells, most fluorescence at room temperature comes from photosystem II when the excitation light is at a wavelength absorbed by chlorophyll rather than by the phycobilins. Hence, FRAP measurements recorded with chlorophyll excitation and emission in the red (>665 nm) report on the mobility of photosystem II (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that photosystem II appears completely immobile even on a time scale of 20 min in the cyanobacterium Dactylococcopsis salina (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and that no photosystem II diffusion can be detected on short time scales in Synechococcus 7942 (7Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows a typical long term FRAP measurement on a cell of Synechococcus 7942 excited at 457 nm, a wavelength predominantly absorbed by chlorophyll a. We bleached a line across the cell by scanning the confocal spot repeatedly in the x direction across the center of the cell (11Mullineaux C.W. Sarcina M.

Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This generated a bleached line whose profile is approximately Gaussian (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Mullineaux C.W. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with a half-width (1/e2) of 0.67 ± 0.04 μm. Approximately 85% of the fluorescence was bleached at the center of the line, whereas repeated imaging led to no significant bleaching in the remainder of the cell. The images show no obvious recovery of the bleach during the 30-min time course of the measurement (Fig. 4). By contrast, when the light-harvesting phycobilisomes are monitored there is substantial fluorescence recovery on a time scale of a few seconds (7Sarcina M. Tobin M.J. Mullineaux C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46830-46834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Aspinwall C.L. Sarcina M. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The bleach depth in Fig. 4 was estimated by extracting fluorescence profiles and fitting Gaussian curves as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The bleach depth (expressed as the fraction of the original fluorescence bleached) was initially 0.85 ± 0.02, and after 30 min it was 0.82 ± 0.02. Thus, there was no significant recovery of the bleach even after 30 min and, hence, no detectable diffusion of photosystem II (Fig. 4). The fluorescence recovery that would be expected for a given value of D in the FRAP measurement shown in Fig. 4 can be predicted by using the one-dimensional diffusion equation (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the observed half-width of the bleach. A diffusion coefficient of 10–12 cm2 s–1 would lead to ∼50% fluorescence recovery in the center of the bleach in 30 min, whereas a diffusion coefficient of 2 × 10–13 cm2 s–1 would lead to ∼10% recovery in 30 min. We can be confident that fluorescence recovery after 30 min was below 10% and, therefore, that the diffusion coefficient for PSII is below 2 × 10–13cm2 s–1. FRAP Measurements on Iron-stressed Cells—When IsiA is strongly expressed, most of the cell fluorescence at room temperature comes from IsiA when chlorophyll is excited (Fig. 2). Therefore, to a first approximation the confocal fluorescence micrographs recorded with chlorophyll excitation under these conditions show the location of IsiA. This allows us to use FRAP to probe the mobility of IsiA. We generally grow cells of Synechococcus 7942 in 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for FRAP measurements because this leads to significant cell elongation without detectable perturbation of photosynthetic function (9Aspinwall C.L. Sarcina M. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Measurements of the diffusion coefficient are more accurate in elongated cells (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In these measurements, however, we did not need to use dimethyl sulfoxide because a significant proportion of the iron-stressed cells were already elongated. Fig. 5 shows images taken from a typical FRAP sequence recorded for an iron-stressed cell with excitation at 457 nm. A significant spread and recovery of the bleach can be observed on a time scale of ∼1–3 min, indicating diffusion of IsiA. IsiA diffusion coefficients were obtained from such image sequences as those described previously (9Aspinwall C.L. Sarcina M. Mullineaux C.W. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 79: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 13Mullineaux C.W. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 1207-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). IsiA diffusion coefficients were quite uniform in all of the cells measured. The mean diffusion coefficient was (3.4 ± 0.8) × 10–11 cm2 sec–1. There was no indication of an immobile fluorescent fraction, and fluorescence recovery appears nearly complete after ∼3 min (Fig. 5). Thus, we conclude that essentially all of the highly fluorescent IsiA population is mobile. The FRAP data presented in this report were obtained by exciting the cells with blue light absorbed mainly by chlorophyll a while monitoring the emission from chlorophyll a in the red region of the spectrum. In iron-replete cells of Synechococcus 7942, fluorescence emission under these conditions is dominated by PSII (Fig. 2). In iron-stressed cells fluorescence emission per cell is much higher and is dominated by fluorescence from IsiA (Fig. 2). Therefore, we can use FRAP to monitor the mobility of PSII in iron-replete cells and IsiA in iron-stressed cells. The IsiA present in the thylakoid membranes of iron-stressed cells is likely to be present in several pools, namely free IsiA, IsiA complexed with PSI (21Boekema E.J. Hifney A. Yakushevska A.E. Piotrowski M. Keegstra W. Berry S. Michel K.P. Pistorius E.K. Kruip J. Nature. 2001; 412: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 22Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and possibly also IsiA complexed with PSII, where it may act as a quencher of excess excitation (23Sandström S. Park Y.I. Öquist G. Gustafsson P. Photochem. Photobiol. 2001; 74: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). When IsiA is complexed with reaction centers, its fluorescence is strongly quenched because of energy transfer (22Bibby T.S. Nield J. Barber J. Nature. 2001; 412: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 24Andrizhiyevskaya E.G. Schwabe T.M.E. Germano M. D'Haene S. Kruip J. van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, our fluorescence measurements in iron-stressed cells report mainly on the pool of IsiA that is free in the membrane rather than specifically complexed to reaction centers. For our purposes, this pool of free IsiA provides a convenient fluorescent probe that allows us to assess the extent to which an integral membrane protein is free to diffuse in the thylakoid membrane. Previous work on the cyanobacterium D. salina showed that PSII is completely immobile with no diffusion detectable even on long time scales (12Mullineaux C.W. Tobin M.J. Jones G.R. Nature. 1997; 390: 421-424Crossref Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The present study shows that the situation is similar in iron-replete cells of Synechococcus 7942, i.e. no diffusion is detectable even after 30 min, indicating that the diffusion coefficient for PSII must be below 2 × 10–13 cm2 s–1 (Fig. 4). This situation is quite unusual for a membrane protein. Most quantitative data for the mobility of membrane proteins in vivo come from eukaryotic plasma membranes. In these membranes, proteins typically have diffusion coefficients in the range of ∼10–10 to 10–9 cm2 s–1 (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Some proteins have diffusion coefficients slower than this, probably because they are anchored or trapped by the cortical cytoskeleton (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Operationally, proteins with diffusion coefficients below 1–5 × 10–12 cm2 s–1 are generally defined as immobile (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and PSII clearly falls into this category. This raises the question as to whether the extreme immobility of photosystem II is a specific property of this complex or whether all of the integral membrane proteins in the thylakoid membrane are locked into a rigid array. Chlorophyll FRAP measurements on iron-stressed cells show considerable spread and recovery of the bleach on a time scale of a few minutes (Fig. 5). Because chlorophyll fluorescence in these cells is dominated by IsiA (Fig. 2), we conclude that IsiA is mobile with a diffusion coefficient of ∼3 × 10–11 cm2 s–1. Because PSII fluorescence in iron-stressed cells is low compared with IsiA fluorescence, we cannot say whether PSII remains immobile under these conditions, and we have no information on the mobility of other complexes such as PSI. Compared with a typical eukaryotic plasma membrane protein, IsiA diffusion is slow (14Zhang F. Lee G.M. Jacobson K. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This may be a consequence of the very crowded environment of the thylakoid membrane with its dense packing of protein complexes (28Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and very high ratio of protein to lipid (18Szalontai B. Nishiyama Y. Gombos Z. Murata N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is clear that under these conditions the integral thylakoid membrane proteins are not all locked into a rigid matrix preventing diffusion. Photosynthetic function in our iron-stressed cells remains relatively normal, indicating that there is no major loss of photosynthetic complexes; the thylakoid membranes of the iron-stressed cells are likely to be as densely packed with protein as the thylakoid membranes of iron-replete cells. The mobility of IsiA indicates that the immobility of PSII has a specific cause rather than being a general property of all thylakoid membrane proteins. The intact PSII complex is considerably larger than IsiA, but this cannot account for such an extreme difference in diffusion coefficient. One possibility is that PSII may be immobilized by large scale oligomerization because it is often found arranged as rows of dimers in cyanobacterial thylakoid membranes (15Olive J. Ajlani G. Astier C. Recouvreur M. Vernotte C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 275-282Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that PSII is immobilized by crowding and/or specific interactions in the thylakoid lumen. PSII has a large domain on the lumenal side of the membrane mainly composed of the water-oxidizing complex and associated proteins (16Zouni A. Witt H.-T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar). By contrast, IsiA has only minor hydrophilic loops in the lumen (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The lumen is crowded with protein (17Albertsson P.-A.̊. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 349-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), so it is possible that PSII may be immobilized by its lumenal domain. In fact, the most obvious difference between IsiA and the homologous CP43 protein of PSII is that the largest hydrophilic lumenal loop of CP43 is greatly truncated in IsiA (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Burnap et al. postulated that the loss of this loop might facilitate migration of IsiA throughout the thylakoid membrane system and that this might be important for a presumed function as a chlorophyll donor during the assembly of new reaction centers (20Burnap R.L. Troyan T. Sherman L.A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that thylakoid membrane proteins can be mobile, at least if they do not have major lumenal domains. This is particularly important when considering possible mechanisms for the assembly and turnover of the photosystems. A rigid, immobile array of thylakoid proteins would imply that all turnover, repair, and biosynthesis of the integral membrane protein complexes would have to occur in situ and could be mediated only by soluble proteins. There is evidence to suggest that the initial stages of synthesis of the reaction centers may occur in the plasma membrane rather than the thylakoid membrane (29Zak E. Norling B. Maitra R. Huang F. Andersson B. Pakrasi H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13443-13448Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which nascent photosystems could be transferred to the thylakoid membranes is not known, because the nature of any connections between the plasma and thylakoid membranes is not clear (28Mullineaux C.W. Aust. J. Plant Physiol. 1999; 26: 671-677Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, our results indicate that it is plausible that repaired or newly synthesized reaction centers could diffuse within the thylakoid membrane system to reach their eventual locations. Alternatively, membrane-bound proteins such as FtsH, which is known to be involved in the PSII repair cycle (30Silva P. Thompson E.P. Bailey S. Kruse O. Mullineaux C.W. Robinson C. Mann N.H. Nixon P.J. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2152-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), could diffuse to mediate turnover and repair in situ.

https://openalex.org/W2091381826,"The mechanism by which folate deficiency influences carcinogenesis is not well established, but a phenotype of DNA strand breaks, mutations, and chromosomal instability suggests an inability to repair DNA damage. To elucidate the mechanism by which folate deficiency influences carcinogenicity, we have analyzed the effect of folate deficiency on base excision repair (BER), the pathway responsible for repairing uracil in DNA. We observe an up-regulation in initiation of BER in liver of the folate-deficient mice, as evidenced by an increase in uracil DNA glycosylase protein (30%, p < 0.01) and activity (31%, p < 0.05). However, no up-regulation in either BER or its rate-determining enzyme, DNA polymerase β (β-pol) is observed in response to folate deficiency. Accordingly, an accumulation of repair intermediates in the form of DNA single strand breaks (37% increase, p < 0.03) is observed. These data indicate that folate deficiency alters the balance and coordination of BER by stimulating initiation without subsequently stimulating the completion of repair, resulting in a functional BER deficiency. In directly establishing that the inability to induce β-pol and mount a BER response when folate is deficient is causative in the accumulation of toxic repair intermediates, β-pol-haploin-sufficient mice subjected to folate deficiency displayed additional increases in DNA single strand breaks (52% increase, p < 0.05) as well as accumulation in aldehydic DNA lesions (38% increase, p < 0.01). Since young β-polhaploinsufficient mice do not spontaneously exhibit increased levels of these repair intermediates, these data demonstrate that folate deficiency and β-pol haploinsufficiency interact to increase the accumulation of DNA damage. In addition to establishing a direct role for β-pol in the phenotype expressed by folate deficiency, these data are also consistent with the concept that repair of uracil and abasic sites is more efficient than repair of oxidized bases.

In addition to establishing a direct role for β-pol in the phenotype expressed by folate deficiency, these data are also consistent with the concept that repair of uracil and abasic sites is more efficient than repair of oxidized bases. In human studies, folate deficiency is associated with cancers of the lung, cervix, brain, esophagus, pancreas, breast, colon, and liver (reviewed in Refs. 1Glynn S.A. Albanes D. Nutr. Cancer. 1994; 22: 101-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar and 2Choi S.W. Mason J.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). In support of the epidemiology, the role of folate in the development of both colon and liver cancer has been experimentally demonstrated in animal studies. Folate deficiency enhances the carcinogenic effect of dimethylhydrazine (3Cravo M.L. Mason J.B. Dayal Y. Hutchinson M. Smith D. Selhub J. Rosenberg I.H. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5002-5006PubMed Google Scholar), whereas folate supplementation is protective (4Kim Y.I. Salomon R.N. Graeme-Cook F. Choi S.W. Smith D.E. Dallal G.E. Mason J.B. Gut. 1996; 39: 732-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Folate/methyl deficiency results in hepatocarcinogenesis (5Hoover K.L. Lynch P.H. Poirier L.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 73: 1327-1336PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, livers of folate/methyl-deficient rats accumulate preneoplastic changes in response to folate deficiency (6James S.J. Miller B.J. Basnakian A.G. Pogribny I.P. Pogribna M. Muskhelishvili L. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It is suggested that the carcinogenic properties of folate deficiency are related to a reduction in S-adenosylmethionine levels altering DNA methylation status and/or to depletion of thymidylate resulting in increased uracil content of DNA. Additionally, folate is required for de novo purine biosynthesis. Which of these factors may be responsible for inducing carcinogenesis is presently unknown. Whereas the underlying mechanism connecting folate deficiency to cancer remains unknown, it is clear that folate deficiency induces a phenotype suggestive of an inability to repair DNA damage. The accumulation of strand breaks, mutations, and chromosomal instability observed in response to folate deficiency all suggest that DNA repair capacity is inhibited. In support of this, folate-deficient cells and animals inefficiently repair alkylation damage (7Branda R.F. Hacker M. Lafayette A. Nigels E. Sullivan L. Nicklas J.A. O'Neill J.P. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1998; 32: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Folate deficiency acts synergistically with ethane methyl sulfonate in Chinese hamster ovary cells (8Branda R.F. Lafayette A.R. O'Neill J.P. Nicklas J.A. Mutation Res. 1999; 427: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting an inability to repair ethane methyl sulfonate-induced damage. Folate depletion in human lymphocytes sensitizes to oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide (9Duthie S.J. Hawdon A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Human colon epithelial cells grown in folate-deficient medium are unable to repair damages induced by methylmethane sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide (10Duthie S.J. Narayanan S. Blum S. Pirie L. Brand G.M. Nutr. Cancer. 2000; 37: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Folate deficiency impairs the ability of neurons and colonocytes to repair DNA damage (11Kruman I.I. Kumaravel T.S. Lohani A. Pedersen W.A. Cutler R.G. Druman Y. Haughey N. Lee J. Evans M. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1752-1762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Choi S.W. Kim Y.I. Weitzel J.N. Mason J.B. Gut. 1998; 4: 93-99Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the pathway responsible for repairing these damages may be ineffective when folate is limiting by demonstrating a persistence of DNA damage but stop short of directly measuring DNA repair capacity. The objectives of this study are to directly measure the effects of folate deficiency on DNA repair capacity and to begin identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for precipitating a phenotype of cancer susceptibility when folate is deficient. Uracil has been shown to accumulate in response to folate deficiency (9Duthie S.J. Hawdon A. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1491-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 10Duthie S.J. Narayanan S.

The DNA repair pathway for removal of uracil is the base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; Ape, AP endonuclease; β-pol, polymerase β; ASB, aldehyde-reactive probe slot blot; ADL, aldehydic DNA lesion; DTT, dithiothreitol; I.D.V., integrated density value; ROPS, random oligonucleotideprimed synthesis; TEMPO, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-oxyl.1The abbreviations used are: BER, base excision repair; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; Ape, AP endonuclease; β-pol, polymerase β; ASB, aldehyde-reactive probe slot blot; ADL, aldehydic DNA lesion; DTT, dithiothreitol; I.D.V., integrated density value; ROPS, random oligonucleotideprimed synthesis; TEMPO, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-oxyl. pathway. The BER pathway repairs small, non-helix-distorting lesions in the DNA. In the process of repairing uracil, the following sequence of events occurs. Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), a monofunctional glycosylase, excises uracil from the DNA backbone, creating a transient abasic site. AP endonuclease 1 (Ape1) cleaves the DNA backbone to allow for incorporation of a correct nucleotide by DNA polymerase β (β-pol). This step results in the transient formation of both a 3′-OH-containing DNA single strand break and a deoxyribose phosphate flap containing an aldehydic group. β-pol also performs the rate-limiting step of deoxyribose flap excision (16Srivastava D.K. Vande Berg B.J. Prasad R. Molina J.T. Beard W.A. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21203-21209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), at which point only the 3′-OH group remains until ligation occurs (ligase 1 or ligase 3-XRCC1 complex), at which point the strand break is fully resolved. Typically, BER functions as a tightly coordinated sequence of enzymatic events such that damage is removed, repair is completed, and intermediate products generated during repair do not accumulate. Mice with gene-targeted disruptions in the rate-limiting step of BER exhibit a dysregulation in this coordination and accumulate DNA single strand breaks both spontaneously and in response to carcinogen exposure, have a reduced DNA damage threshold, and exhibit genomic instability in the forms of both mutation induction and chromosomal damage (17Cabelof D.C.

The objective of this study was to directly determine the effect of folate deficiency on base excision repair capacity. Because BER is DNA damage-inducible (23Fornace Jr., A.J. Zmudzka B. Hollander M.C. Wilson S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Cabelof D.C. Raffoul J.J. Yanamadala S. Guo Z. Heydari A.R. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 1419-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expected to observe an induction in the activity of this repair pathway in response to the DNA damage induced by folate deficiency. However, in response to folate deficiency we fail to observe an up-regulation in either BER or the rate-determining enzyme in the pathway, β-pol. This lack of response by the BER pathway should result in an accumulation of the DNA damage induced by folate deficiency. We provide evidence that the initial step of BER, glycosylase-initiated removal of uracil, is up-regulated in response to folate deficiency, without a coordinating increase in activity of the subsequent steps of repair. This dysregulation of BER induces a state of BER deficiency mimicking that observed in mice heterozygous for β-pol. Our data demonstrate that in response to folate deficiency repair is initiated but not completed, resulting in an accumulation of DNA repair intermediate products that are genotoxic (25Horton J.K. Joyce-Gray D.F. Pachkowski B.F. Swenberg J.A. Wilson S.H. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 27-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Since BER deficiency increases cancer susceptibility, this functional BER deficiency in response to folate deficiency may provide an important mechanistic explanation for the increased cancer risk associated with folate deficiency. As such, human polymorphisms and functional mutations within the β-pol gene may interact with folate deficiency to increase cancer risk. This hypothesis is supported by our data demonstrating that folate deficiency results in a greater accumulation of DNA damage in mice haploinsufficient for β-pol. Experiments were performed in young (3–4 months) male C57BL/6-specific pathogen-free mice in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use and care of laboratory animals. The Wayne State University Animal Investigation Committee approved the animal protocol. Mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and fed standard mouse chow and water ad libitum. Mice heterozygous for the DNA polymerase β gene (β-pol+/–) were created in Rajewsky's laboratory by deletion of the promoter and the first exon of the β-pol gene (26Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The animals appear to be normal and are fertile; there is no retardation in food intake, weight gain, or growth rate. The genotype of the mice was determined as described previously (17Cabelof D.C. Guo Z. Raffoul J.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Richardson A. Heydari A.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5799-5807PubMed Google Scholar). At 3–4 months of age, 20 β-pol+/+ and 20 β-pol+/– mice were randomly assigned to two dietary groups and were fed AIN93G-purified isoenergetic diets. (Dyets, Inc., Lehigh Valley, PA). The control group received a folate adequate diet containing 2 mg/kg folic acid. The experimental group received a folate-deficient diet containing 0 mg/kg folic acid. Diets were stored at –20 °C. 1% succinyl sulfathiazole was added to all diets. The animals' food intake and body weights were monitored twice weekly to monitor for signs of toxicity (i.e. weight loss), and the experimental diets were continued for 8 weeks. Animals were anesthetized under CO2 and sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Whole blood was collected, and tissues were flash frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Serum folate levels were measured using the SimulTRAC-SNB radioassay kit for vitamin B12 (57Co) and folate (125I) per the manufacturer's protocol (ICN Diagnostics, Orangeburg, NY). Blood was collected at time of sacrifice and allowed to clot at room temperature for 60 min. Samples were centrifuged, and serum was collected for immediate analysis of serum folate levels. Standards provided in the kit were used to generate a standard curve for determination of sample folate values. Radioactivity was measured by a γ-counter, and values were calculated as described by the manufacturer for both serum folate and serum B12. TEMPO Extraction of DNA—Liver DNA for the aldehyde-reactive probe slot blot (ASB) assay was extracted according to the method described by Hofer and Moller (27Hofer T. Moller L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1998; 11: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with some modifications. This method minimizes artifactual DNA damage by using 20 mm TEMPO in all solutions and reagents and by minimizing heat treatment of DNA. Briefly, 100 mg of liver tissue was homogenized in 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with 20 mm TEMPO and centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Supernatant was decanted, and pellet was resuspended in 2.5 ml of lysis buffer (pH 8.0; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 20 mm TEMPO. Proteinase K (30 units; Ambion, Austin, TX) was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. DNA was extracted with 2.5 ml 70% phenol/water/chloroform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with 20 mm TEMPO. Further extraction with 2.5 ml of sevag (chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, 24:1) with 20 mm TEMPO was completed. DNA was precipitated using 7.5% 4 m NaCl and 2 volumes of 100% cold ethanol, and pellet was washed in 70% ethanol. The pellet was resuspended in 700 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 20 mm TEMPO and rehydrated at 4 °C. The samples were then treated with RNase A (2 μg) and RNase T1 (1,000 units; Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37 °C for 30 min to digest the RNA contamination. DNA was cold ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 400 μl of deionized water at 4 °C. DNA was stored at –70 °C. Gravity Tip Column Extraction of DNA—DNA for the random oligonucleotide-primed synthesis (ROPS) assay was isolated using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) gravity tip columns as described in the manufacturer's protocol. This method generates large fragments of DNA (up to 150 kb) while minimizing shearing. Detection of aldehydic DNA lesions (ADLs) was carried out by ASB as described previously (28Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. DNA (8 μg) was incubated in 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mm aldehyde reactive probe (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) at 37 °C for 10 min. DNA was precipitated by the cold ethanol method (described above) and resuspended in 1× TE buffer overnight at 4 °C. DNA was heat-denatured at 100 °C for 10 min, quickly chilled on ice, and mixed with an equal volume of 2 m ammonium acetate. The nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) was prewet in deionized water and washed for 10 min in 1 mm ammonium acetate. DNA was immobilized on the pretreated nitrocellulose membrane using an Invitrogen filtration manifold system. The membrane was washed in 5× SSC for 15 min at 37 °C and then baked under vacuum at 80 °C for 30 min. The dried membrane was incubated in a hybridization buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% (w/v) casein, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 30 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated in fresh hybridization buffer containing 100 μl of streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) at room temperature for 45 min. Following incubation in horseradish peroxidase, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min each at 37 °C in TBS, pH 7.5 (0.26 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Tween 20). Membrane was incubated in ECL (Pierce) for 5 min at room temperature and visualized using a ChemiImager™ system (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). Nuclear proteins for Western analyses and enzymatic activity assays were isolated using the Sigma CelLytic™ NuCLEAR™ extraction kit, a method that disrupts cells with hypotonic buffer, allowing the cytoplasmic fraction to be removed while the nuclear proteins are released from the nuclei by a high salt buffer. All samples and tubes were handled and chilled on ice, and all solutions were made fresh according to the manufacturer's protocol. The extract was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. In order to remove salt, the crude nuclear extract was dialyzed against 1 liter of dialysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm NaS2O5, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for 4–6 h at 4 °C using Slide-A-Lyzer® mini-dialysis units suspended in a floatation device (Pierce). The dialyzed nuclear extracts were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined according to Bradford using Protein Assay Kit I (Bio-Rad). Western analysis was performed using liver nuclear extracts (50 μg) subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a Hybond™ ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Bio-Rad semidry transfer apparatus. Prior to hybridization, the membranes were stained with MemCode (Pierce) to ensure equal transfer of protein to the membrane. Western blot analysis was accomplished using manufacturer-recommended dilutions of antisera developed against UDG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), p53 (polyclonal antibody 240; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-pol (Ab-1 Clone 18S; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), and Ape/Ref1 (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO). The bands were detected and quantified using a ChemiImager™ system (AlphaInnotech) after incubation in SuperSignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The data are expressed as the integrated density value (I.D.V.) of the band per μg of protein loaded. UDG activity was determined as described by Stuart et al. (29Stuart J.A. Karahalil B. Hogue B.A. Souza-Pinto N.C. Bohr V.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 595-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 20-μl reaction contained 70 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 75 mm NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 90 fmol of 5′-end-labeled single-stranded uracil-containing oligonucleotide that was 3′-protected by an amino-spacer (5′-ATATACCGCGGUCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATT-3′, MIDLAND, Midland, TX), and 5 μg of liver nuclear extract. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then terminated by the addition of 5 μg of proteinase K and 1 μl of 10% SDS and incubation at 55 °C for 30 min. DNA was precipitated in glycogen, ammonium acetate, and ethanol at –20 °C overnight, resuspended in a loading buffer containing 80% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 μg/ml each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF. Substrate and reaction products were separated on a 20% denaturing sequencing gel. Glycosylase activity (presence of an 11-mer band) was visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad) by calculating the relative amount of the 11-mer oligonucleotide product with the unreacted 30-mer substrate (product/product + substrate). The data are expressed as machine counts/μg of protein. Negative controls consisted of the reaction mixture and oligonucleotide in the absence of nuclear extract. 1 unit of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor was added to one sample in each reaction to demonstrate that incision activity was the result of UDG specifically and not another uracil-specific glycosylase (i.e. SMUG). The 5′-endonuclease activity of Ape was analyzed using a quantitative in vitro assay that measures the incision of a 26-mer duplex oligonucleotide substrate containing a tetrahydrofuran (F) AP site as previously described (30Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). A 26-mer oligonucleotide (5′-AATTCACCGGTACCFTCTAGAATTCG-3′) was 5′-end-labeled and annealed to an equimolar amount of the complementary strand (5′-CGAATTCTAGAGGGTACCGGTGAATT-3′). 2.5 pmol of double strand oligonucleotide was incubated with 100 ng of crude nuclear extract from liver of control and folate-deficient mice for 15 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 50 mm EDTA (reaction mixture; final concentrations: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Reaction products were run on a 15% denaturing sequencing gel. Endonuclease activity (presence of a 14-mer band) was visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad) by calculating the relative amount of the 14-mer oligonucleotide product with the unreacted 26-mer substrate (product/product + substrate). The data are expressed as machine counts/ng of protein. BER capacity was determined as described previously (17Cabelof D.C. Guo Z. Raffoul J.J. Sobol R.W. Wilson S.H. Richardson A. Heydari A.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 5799-5807PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeled and purified 30-bp oligonucleotides (upper strand, 5′-ATATACCGCGGUCGGCCGATCAAGCTTATT-3′; lower strand, 3′-TATATGGCGCCGGCCGGCTAGTTCGAATAA-5′) containing a G:U mismatch and an HpaII restriction site (GGCC) and protected by a 3′ amino spacer were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5mm MgCl2,1mm DTT, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NAD, 20 μm dNTPs, 5 mm di-Tris-phosphocreatine, 10 units of creatine phosphokinase) with 50 μg of nuclear extract isolated from liver of control and folate-deficient mice. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 5 min at 95 °C to stop the reaction. The duplex oligonucleotides were allowed to reanneal for 1 h at room temperature and spun down to pellet the denatured proteins. The duplex oligonucleotides present in the supernatant were treated with 20 units of HpaII (Promega, Madison, WI) for 1 h at 37 °C and separated by electrophoresis on a 20% denaturing sequencing gel. Repair activity (presence of a 16-mer band) is visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager® System (Bio-Rad) by calculating the ratio of the 16-mer oligonucleotide product with the 30-mer substrate (product/substrate). The data are expressed as machine counts/μg of protein. The relative number of 3′-OH group-containing DNA strand breaks was quantified using a Klenow(exo–) incorporation assay based on the ability of Klenow to initiate DNA synthesis from a 3′-OH (31Basnakian A.G. James S.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA was heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min, and 0.25 μg of DNA was added to 15 μl of a Klenow reaction buffer (0.5 mm dTTP, 0.5 mm dGTP, 0.5 mm dATP, 0.33 μm dCTP, 5 units of Klenow(exo–) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA)) with 10× Klenow buffer per the manufacturer's protocol (New England Biolabs) and 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reaction mixtures were incubated at 16 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped with the addition of 25 μl of 12.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Samples were spotted (5 μl) onto scored and numbered Whatman DE81 chromatography paper and allowed to airdry. The chromatography paper was then washed five times for 5 min each time in 0.5 m Na2HPO4 (dibasic) to remove unincorporated [α-32P]dCTP and then rinsed twice briefly in water and allowed to air-dry. Paper was cut and placed into scintillation vials with 2.5 ml of Scinti Verse mixture (Fisher). Incorporation of [α-32P]dCTP was quantified using a Packard scintillation counter. Statistical significance between means was determined using analysis of variance followed by Fisher's least significant difference test where appropriate (32Sokal R.R. Rohlf F.J. Biometry. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York1981: 169-176Google Scholar). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In an extensive study, we have carefully characterized the effect of folate deficiency on weight gain/loss and plasma folate levels in C57BL/6 mice. Throughout the 8-week feeding study, the animals' food intake and body weights were monitored twice weekly. Long term folate deficiency can result in toxicity, evidenced primarily by weight loss. Importantly, in our studies, no difference in food intake or weight gain/loss was observed (Fig. 1A). It is essential to demonstrate that the experimental diet (0 mg/kg folic acid) resulted in decreased serum folate levels. As expected, a significant decrease in the level of serum folate in the folate-deficient mouse was observed. The 0 mg/kg folic acid group had serum folate levels 93% lower than the control animals (p < 0.001), such that the folate levels of the deficient animals approached zero (Fig. 1B). The addition of 1% succinyl sulfathiazole allowed attainment of this severity of folate deficiency by preventing intestinal production of folates. Since vitamin B12 can alter one-carbon metabolism through its participation in the methionine synthase reaction, it was important to determine whether our results might be confounded by changes in serum B12 levels. Importantly, no differences were observed in B12 levels between control and deficient groups (data not shown). There was no effect"

Here, we provide the first biochemical characterization and cellular localization of cGKs encoded by the major transcripts of dg2: dg2P1 and dg2P2. cGMP stimulates kinase activity of DG2P1 (EC50: 0.13 ± 0.039 μm) and DG2P2 (EC50: 0.32 ± 0.14 μm) in Malpighian tubule and S2 cell extracts. DG2P1 and DG2P2 are magnesium-requiring enzymes and were inhibited by 10 and 100 μm of a cGK inhibitor, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp isomer; whereas DG1, the cGK encoded by the D. melanogaster dg1 gene, was unaffected. DG2P1 and DG2P2 were localized in the plasma membrane in S2 cells, whereas DG1 was localized in the cytosol. The D. melanogaster fluid-transporting Malpighian tubule was used as an organotypic model to analyze cGK localization and function in vivo. Targeted expression of DG2P2, DG2P1, and DG1 in tubule cells via the UAS/GAL4 system in transgenic flies revealed differential localization of all three cGKs in vivo: DG2P2 expression at the apical membrane; DG2P1 expression at both the apical and basolateral membranes; and DG1 expression at the basolateral membrane and in the cytosol. Transgenic tubules for all three cGKs displayed enhanced cGK activity compared with wild-type tubules. The physiological impact of targeted expression of individual cGKs in tubule principal cells was assessed by measuring basal and stimulated rates of fluid transport. DG1 expression greatly enhanced fluid transport by the tubule in response to exogenous cGMP, whereas DG2P2 expression significantly increased fluid transport in response to the nitridergic neuropeptide, capa-1. Thus, dg2-encoded proteins are bona fide cGKs, which have differential roles in epithelial fluid transport, as assessed by in vivo studies. Furthermore, a novel epithelial role is suggested for DG1, which is considerably more responsive to cGMP than to capa-1 stimulation. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) forms encoded by the dg2 (for) gene are implicated in behavior and epithelial transport in Drosophila melanogaster.

Signaling via guanosine cGMP is an important regulatory process for diverse physiological processes.

Although major roles of cGKs in physiological function have been established in vertebrates, considerably less is known about cGK in other organisms. cGMP signaling has been implicated in behavioral and neural phenotypes in invertebrates, including Caenorhabditis elegans (14Coates J.C. de Bono M.

Biol. 2003; 206: 2507-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), cGK has been shown to influence feeding and social behavior. However, the studies in insects have been based on genetic analysis of a gene encoding cGK, dg2 (foraging, for), whereas little is known about the actual enzymes encoded by dg2. In Drosophila, cGKs are encoded by two known genes: dg1 and dg2 (19Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dg1 gene product was characterized as having bona fide cGK activity (20Foster J.L. Higgins G.C. Jackson F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23322-23328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); however, dg2-encoded cGK has, until now, been uncharacterized. dg2 is a complex gene, comprising several exons encoding four major transcripts, P1, P2, P3, and P4 (available at fly.ebi.ac.uk:7081/.bin/fbidq.html?FBgn0000721) (19Kalderon D. Rubin G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10738-10748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which encode proteins of different sizes: 1088 aa (DG2P1), 742 aa (DG2P2), 894 aa (DG2P3), and 934 aa (DG2P4). Thus, analysis of cGK must necessarily distinguish these specific transcripts and products. Given the relevance of cGK to behavior, it is thus of interest to investigate the biochemistry of the dg2-encoded cGK family in Drosophila. Furthermore, the elegant transgenic tools afforded to Drosophila workers (21Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allows study of cGKs in an organotypic context, using targeted gene technology. Finally, well defined physiological phenotypes in Drosophila provide a basis for evaluating targeted genes in this organism. The insect Malpighian (renal) tubule is a fluid-transporting organ analogous to vertebrate kidney/liver and is essential to insect survival. D. melanogaster tubules, which constitute an important genetic model for transporting epithelia (22Dow J.A.T. Davies S.A. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 687-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), display increased fluid transport rates when stimulated by either exogenous cGMP, which enters tubule cells via a cyclic nucleotide transporter (23Riegel J.A.

NO- and capa-stimulated cGMP signaling is compartmentalized to principal cells in the main, fluid-secreting segment of tubules (27Kean L. Cazenave W. Costes L. Broderick K.E. Graham S. Pollock V.P.

Physiol. 1995; 269: R1321-R1326PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that cGMP signaling may regulate ion transport in tubules. Previous work using PCR has also shown that tubules express both dg1 and dg2 genes (24Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of cGK in this tissue; which could be valuable approach for studying Drosophila cGKs in vivo. In this report, we provide the first biochemical characterization of transcript-specific dg2-encoded cGKs. The roles of Drosophila cGKs were also investigated in the context of epithelial transport via targeted overexpression of both dg1 and dg2 transcripts in transgenic lines using a cell-specific GAL4 driver. Analysis of tubule function from such lines has allowed delineation of the roles of individual Drosophila cGKs in an organotypic context for the first time. Intact D. melanogaster Malpighian tubules were dissected and used to make template cDNA for PCR reactions. Primers specific for the DG1 gene transcript and each of the two major DG2 gene transcripts were used to create PCR products encompassing the appropriate open reading frames. These were sequenced to confirm their identity and then cloned into the pMT/V5-HIS-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) suitable for expression in Drosophila S2 cells. To create plasmids for expression of DG1 and DG2 proteins containing a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (GKPIPNPLLGLDST, derived from a small epitope (Pk) present on the P and V proteins of the paramyxovirus of simian virus 5), PCR mutagenesis was carried out that allowed removal of the stop codon from each of the open reading frames. To ensure fidelity of the coding regions, proofreading Taq polymerase (Promega) was used in the reactions. The mutated PCR products were sequenced and then cloned into the pMT/V5-HIS-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Expression constructs for vertebrate cGKIα (31Begum N. Sandu O.A. Ito M. Lohmann S.M.

These plasmids were then used for the transient transfection of S2 cells under conditions of Cu2+-inducible expression. Cells were cultured according to standard protocols (30Radford J.C. Davies S.A.

Approximately 3 × 106 cells were used in each transfection, which was performed using calcium phosphate according to standard techniques (Invitrogen); transfection efficiencies were routinely 5-15%. S2 Cells—Coverslips were treated with poly-l-lysine solution within a wax circle before addition of 50 μl of either untransfected (control) or dg2P1-, dg2P2-, or dg1-transfected S2 cell suspension. The cells were allowed to settle for 15 min and then treated as follows: 2 × 5 min washes in PBS; 1 × 5 min wash in 70% (v/v) -20 °C methanol at -20 °C (fixation); 3 × 2 min washes in PBS; 1 × 5 min wash in PBS with 0.2% (w/v) BSA; 1 × 25 min incubation in PBS with 0.2% BSA (w/v) and either V5-epitope antibody (1/2000) (Amersham Biosciences) or rabbit polyclonal anti-cGKIα antibody (11Markert T.

Coverslips were then mounted on slides in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) prior to fluorescence imaging using a confocal system (Bio-Rad Radiance). Malpighian Tubules—Immunostaining protocol for tubules was performed as previously described (34MacPherson M.R. Pollock V.P. Broderick K.B. Kean L. O'Connell F.C. Dow J.A.T. Davies S.-A. Am. J.

Higher concentrations of primary antibody were used, but no significant improvement in labeling intensity was observed. Tubules were viewed under fluorescence using an Axiocam imaging system (Zeiss) or a confocal system (Bio-Rad Radiance). Samples of 3 × 106dg2P1-, dg2P2-, and dg1-transfected S2 cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 3 min. Cells were resuspended in fresh Schneider's medium (S2 cell culture medium, Invitrogen), spun down once more, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-protease inhibitors obtained as protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). Cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were collected. The protein content of each sample was estimated using the Bradford assay. Samples (10 μg of protein each) were loaded onto each lane for Western analysis, performed according to standard protocols (33Broderick K.E. Kean L. Dow J.A.T. Pyne N.J. Davies S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8159-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were probed with anti-V5-epitope antibody (1/2000) (Invitrogen) or rabbit polyclonal anti-cGKIα antibody (1/400) (11Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pohler D. Hausler C. Walter U.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a concentration of 1/8000. Assays for both S2 cells and Drosophila heads, bodies, and tubules were carried out as described previously (52MacPherson M.R. Broderick K.E. Graham S. Day J.P. Houslay M.D. Dow J.A. Davies S.A. J.

Preliminary experiments showed that optimal measurements of cGK activity were achieved using GLASStide as the substrate and a reaction time of 30 min. This prolonged time was necessary to obtain reliable radioactivity counts from tubule samples. For S2 cell extracts, similar Vmax readings were obtained for reaction times from 3 to 60 min; therefore, for consistency, a 30-min reaction time was used for both cell and tubule preparations. S2 Cells—Cells were collected and washed once in Schneider's medium before collection and resuspension in homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fifty microliters of homogenization buffer was used per 106 cells, i.e. 150 μl per transfection. Each individual transfection was assayed for cGMP-dependent kinase activity, which was routinely observed to be 20-fold that of untransfected cells, after adjustment for transfection efficiency. Fly Tissue—Approximately 200 heads, 200 bodies, or 800 tubules from 1-week-old Oregon R (wild-type) adults were dissected and placed in 200 μl of homogenization buffer as above. Tissue was homogenized and centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g to remove debris. Protein concentration of homogenates was determined by the Bradford assay, and homogenates were adjusted to equivalent protein concentrations for use in cGK assays. Expression of dg1 and dg2 transcripts was determined by performing reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR on tubule cDNA preparations. Twenty tubules were dissected, poly(A)+ RNA-extracted (Dynal mRNA direct kit), and reverse-transcribed with Superscript Plus (Invitrogen) as described previously (24Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar). One microliter of the reverse transcription reaction, containing cDNAs derived from one tubule (∼160 cells), was used as a template for the PCR performed with appropriate gene-specific primer pairs based on published sequences.

PCR products obtained from such RT-PCR experiments were cloned using the Invitrogen topoisomerase (TOPO TA Cloning) system. Cloned plasmids were purified using Qiagen kits and sequenced to confirm their identity. The cloned PCR products shared 100% sequence identity with appropriate dg1 and dg2 transcripts (data not shown). Complete coding sequences for DG2-P1, DG2-P2, and DG1 were sub-cloned into pP{UAST} vectors and used to transform Drosophila embryos according to standard techniques as previously described (33Broderick K.E.

The chromosomal location of each insertion was determined by standard crossing schemes. All strains were maintained on a standard Drosophila diet at 25 °C and 55% humidity, on a 12:12 photoperiod. Drosophila lines used in this study were: w1118 (parental strain used for transformation of embryos); UAS-dg2P1, UAS-dg2P2, and UAS-dg1 (generated for this study); c42: GAL4 enhancer trap line, used to drive expression of UAS constructs in only tubule principal cells (33Broderick K.E.

Various balancer lines were also used to establish chromosomal location of transgenes in UAS lines generated (not shown). Insects were used at 7 days post-emergence for all experiments. Intact Malpighian tubules were isolated from parental lines (c42) and c42/UAS-transgenic lines, as specified in the legend of Fig. 5 into 10-μl drops of Schneider's medium under liquid paraffin. Fluid secretion rates were measured in tubules as detailed elsewhere (38Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H. Gortz A. Skaer N.J. Brogan S. Kaiser K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 197: 421-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basal rates of fluid transport were measured for 30 min, and tubules were either left untreated (controls) or treated with known stimulants of fluid transport: either cGMP (10-4m) (33Broderick K.E. Kean L. Dow J.A.T. Pyne N.J. Davies S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8159-8168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or capa-1 (10-7m) (27Kean L. Cazenave W. Costes L.

The concentrations of cGMP and capa-1 used were those that elicited maximum fluid transport responses compared with controls (24Dow J.A.T. Maddrell S.H. Davies S.A. Skaer N.J. Kaiser K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1716-R1719PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kean L. Cazenave W. Costes L. Broderick K.E. Graham S. Pollock V.P. Davies S.A. Veenstra J.A. Dow J.A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: R1297-R1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). After stimulation, fluid secretion rates were measured for a further 40 min. Data are expressed as rates of fluid transport (nanoliters/min) ± S.E. Where appropriate, statistical significance was assessed using Student's t test for unpaired samples, taking p < 0.05 as the critical value. To characterize dg2-encoded proteins, V5 epitope-tagged, cloned full-length transcripts were expressed in Drosophila S2 cells. Fig. 1A shows the localization of dg2-encoded proteins DG2P1 and DG2P2 in this cell line, achieved by immunocytochemistry using either anti-V5 antibody or a vertebrate cGK antibody, anti-cGKI (11Markert T. Vaandrager A.B. Gambaryan S. Pohler D. Hausler C. Walter U. De Jonge H.R. Jarchau T. Lohmann S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 822-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Because dg2-encoded cGK has been proposed to be closely related to vertebrate cGKI (32Jarchau T. Hausler C. Markert T. Pohler D. Vanderkerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that an anti-cGKI antibody would recognize DG2. Both DG2P1 and DG2P2 show a clear plasma membrane localization using both anti-V5 and anti-cGKI antibody; furthermore, co-localization between staining patterns using anti-V5 and -cGKI antibodies is demonstrated. We also show that both antibodies recognize specific DG2 bands of the correct predicted sizes by Western blotting (Fig. 1C), suggesting that anti-cGKI antibody does indeed recognize dg2-encoded cGK. In contrast to the clear membrane localization of DG2 proteins, DG1 is localized rather more diffusely in S2 cells, showing staining adjacent to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, whereas there is some possible co-localization observed between DG1 staining with anti-V5 and -cGKI antibodies, Western blotting reveals that the vertebrate antibody may not recognize full-length transfected DG1 in S2 cells (Fig. 1C). Although the predicted size of V5-tagged DG1 is ∼90 kDa, the band observed in the anti-V5 Western is ∼75 kDa, suggesting proteolytic cleavage of DG1. Indeed, a 65-kDa subunit that retains catalytic activity has been shown to occur upon induction of DG1 expression in Sf9 cells (20Foster J.L. Higgins G.C. Jackson F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23322-23328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar): the 65-kDa fragment was not recognized by an N-terminal antibody to DG1, suggesting that it represents the C-terminal end of DG1. Our data support this, in that the anti-V5 antibody recognizes DG1 tagged at the C terminus as a smaller band than the predicted size. Autophosphorylation of DG1 at 84 kDa has been demonstrated (20Foster J.L. Higgins G.C. Jackson F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23322-23328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), 2M. MacPherson and S. Davies, unpublished observations. suggesting that under some conditions DG1 does exist at the correct molecular mass, although it seems to be proteolytically cleaved in our studies when exogenously expressed and isolated for Western analysis. Finally, staining of DG1 in transfected intact S2 cells (Fig. 1A) and dg1 transgenic tubules (see Fig. 4,"

To date, there is only one gene product (WaaL, often referred to as “ligase”) known to be required. There exists a requirement for a specific lipid A-core oligosaccharide acceptor structure for ligation activity, and it has been proposed that the WaaL protein imparts this acceptor specificity. Here the structural requirements in the core oligosaccharide acceptor for O antigen ligation are investigated in prototype serovars of Salmonella enterica. Complementation experiments in mutants with defined core oligosaccharide structure indicate that the specificity of the ligation reaction for a particular core oligosaccharide structure is not dependent on the WaaL protein alone.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; core OS, core oligosaccharide; und-PP, undecaprenol pyrophosphate. is a complex glycolipid located in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS contributes to permeability-barrier properties and stability of the outer membrane (1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). LPS molecules can be subdivided into three structurally distinct regions. The hydrophobic lipid A forms the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and is responsible for the endotoxic properties of LPS. The core oligosaccharide (core OS) serves as a link between lipid A and the distal repeating unit polysaccharide known as O antigen. O antigen plays a direct role in virulence, contributing to the resistance of the bacterium to complement-mediated serum killing (2Joiner K.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 121: 99-133PubMed Google Scholar). LPS O antigens provide important elements in serological distinction among isolates from a genus or species. The genus Salmonella is subdivided into two species, Salmonella enterica (including the subspecies I, II, IIIA, IIIB, IV, VI, and VII) and Salmonella bongori (subspecies V) (3Brenner F.W. Villar R.G. Angulo F.J. Tauxe R. Swaminathan B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 2465-2467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assigned to these eight groups are over 2500 recognized serovars (4Popoff M.Y. Bockemuhl J. Gheesling L.L. Res. Microbiol. 2003; 154: 173-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Currently, there are ∼60 characterized O antigens in S. enterica (5Reeves P.R. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 17-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Some serovars have a broad animal host range. For example, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, (a member of subspecies I) causes enteric illness in livestock, rodents, birds, and humans (6Rabsch W. Andrews H.L. Kingsley R.A. Prager R. Tschape H. Adams L.G. Baumler A.J. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2249-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Other serovars, such as Arizonae (subspecies IIIA) and Diarizonae (subspecies IIIB), have a more limited range and are most commonly isolated from reptiles (7Kingsley R.A. Baumler A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1006-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 8Geue L. Loschner U. Vet. Microbiol. 2002; 84: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has served as a prototype for many studies on LPS structure and biosynthesis. During core OS assembly, glycosyl residues are transferred from nucleotide sugar precursors onto preformed lipid A by the action of glycosyltransferases. These enzymes are membrane-associated proteins found on the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane (reviewed in Ref. 1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). Two Salmonella core OS structures have been reported, represented by the prototypes from subspecies 1 (serovar Typhimurium) and subspecies IIIA (serovar Arizonae IIIA) (9Olsthoorn M.M.A. Petersen B.O. Schlecht S. Haverkamp J. Bock K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The structures are highly conserved, with an identical inner core region and the same outer core backbone. They differ in the terminal glycose attached to the GlcII residue, i.e. GlcNAc in serovar Typhimurium and GlcIII in serovar Arizonae IIIA (Fig. 1A). The genetic basis for these differences has been established (10Kaniuk N.A. Monteiro M.A. Parker C.T. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Once complete, the lipid A-core OS molecule is transferred across the inner membrane by the ABC transporter, MsbA (11Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 12Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The O antigen is synthesized separately in one of three known pathways that are each believed to lead to the formation of undecaprenol pyrophosphate (und-PP)-linked polymer at the periplasmic face of the inner membrane (1Raetz C.R.H.

A ligation reaction transfers the nascent O antigen to lipid A-core prior to translocation of the completed LPS molecule to the outer membrane. The GlcII residue is the site of O antigen ligation in both Salmonella core OS structures (Fig. 1A). The mechanism of ligation of O antigen to lipid A-core OS remains one of the most important unresolved issues in LPS assembly. WaaL proteins (or “ligases”) are currently the only protein known to be involved in ligation, but despite the importance of the ligation reaction, little information is available concerning the process or the requirement for additional cellular factors. WaaL proteins in Escherichia coli and Salmonella share highly conserved predicted membrane topology and overall secondary structure (13Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). waaL mutants produce rough LPS (lacking O antigen repeat units) and accumulate intracellular und-PP-linked O antigen (14Mulford C.A. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E. coli K12 can ligate structurally diverse O antigens from cloned O antigen gene clusters; these O antigens can be formed by any of the three known biosynthesis pathways (1Raetz C.R.H. Whitfield C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 635-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (3423) Google Scholar). It is presumed that the observed promiscuity in ligation substrates reflects recognition by the ligation machinery of the conserved und-PP-linked glycan carrier, rather than the specific O antigen structure. To the extent it has been studied directly, the structure of the lipid A-core acceptor is important in ligation. In the serovar Typhimurium, for example, the activity of the waaK gene product is required for ligation (15MacLachlan P.R. Kadam S.K. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7151-7163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). WaaK is the α-1,2-GlcNAc transferase that forms the terminal GlcNAc-1,2-GlcII motif in the outer core OS. Similar results were obtained with the structurally identical ligation site in the R2 core OS of E. coli (13Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, structural analysis of the core OS of serovar Arizonae IIIA (9Olsthoorn M.M.A. Petersen B.O. Schlecht S. Haverkamp J. Bock K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that some LPS molecules possessed linked O antigen but lacked the corresponding α-1,2-linked Glc-1,2-GlcII motif formed by the α-1,2-Glc transferase, WaaH (10Kaniuk N.A. Monteiro M.A. Parker C.T. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Therefore, either the ligation machinery in serovar Arizonae IIIA has a different specificity or, as speculated by Olsthoorn et al. (9Olsthoorn M.M.A. Petersen B.O. Schlecht S. Haverkamp J. Bock K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), some molecules are processed (post-ligation) to remove the substituent. To address these open questions regarding ligase specificity, we have investigated the requirement for a specific core OS acceptor of O antigen for prototype WaaL proteins in Salmonella. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The SalmonellaReference Collection (SARC) contains different strains that exemplify different subspecies that make up the genus Salmonella (16Boyd E.F. Wang F.S. Whittam T.S. Selander R.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 804-808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this collection, there are two isolates representing each of the subspecies, and these isolates have been categorized based on multilocus enzyme electrophoresis analysis. For example, SARC 1 and SARC 2 represent subspecies I, SARC 5 and SARC 6 represent subspecies IIIA (Arizonae), and SARC 7 and SARC 8 represent subspecies IIIB (Diarizonae). All strains were grown at 37 °C in Luria Bertani (LB) medium, supplemented as appropriate with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml), gentamicin (30 μg/ml), kanamycin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), or tetracycline (100 μg/ml) (Sigma). Gene expression from pBAD-derivative plasmids was induced with 0.02% l-arabinose. For selection in allelic exchange experiments with the suicide-delivery vector, pWQ173 (17Rahn A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), bacteria were grown at 45 °C on YEG-Cl media containing 2 g/liter of the analogue p-chlorophenylalanine (17Rahn A.

Open table in a new tab DNA Manipulation—DNA fragments cloned in pBAD24, pBAD18, pWQ173, and pRE112 were obtained by PCR amplification, using primers incorporating appropriate restriction sites to facilitate cloning. Reaction conditions were optimized for each primer pair. Chromosomal DNA PCR templates were prepared using the Insta-gene matrix (Bio-Rad), and PwoI polymerase from Roche Diagnostics was used in all PCRs. Transformation with plasmid DNA was done by electroporation (19Binotto J. MacLachlan P.R. Sanderson P.R. Can. J. Microbiol. 1991; 37: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All plasmids were maintained in E. coli DH5α, except pWQ320 and pWQ321 which were maintained in E. coli TOP10. Primers used for construction of pWQ307 (containing waaH) were 5′-GCATGAATTCTGTATGTTCCTTTTCATATG-3′ (the EcoRI site incorporated in the primer is underlined) and 5′-CCCAATCTAGACTATATTTATACTGAGACC-3′ (XbaI site is underlined). Primers used for construction of pWQ308 and pWQ309 (containing waaK) were 5′-CTGGATTGAATTCATAATGATTAAAAAAT-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-CCTAGGCAGGATCCAATCACTTCTCAAAC-3′ (BamHI). Primers used for the construction of pWQ310, pWQ311, pWQ312, and pWQ313 containing cloned waaL genes were 5′-CCTATTGTGAATTCAAGATGCTAACC-3′ (EcoRI) and 5′-AAGGTATCTAGACGTTTTTTTATTTATTTC-3′ (XbaI). The plasmids pWQ314 and pWQ315 were constructed by digestion of pWQ307 and pWQ308 with NheI and XbaI, and the fragment containing the waaH (pWQ307) or waaK (pWQ308) gene was purified and cloned into pBAD18-Km (20Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar). The waaK gene was also cloned into pBADHisB, which incorporated an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag. This was done by digesting pWQ315 with EcoRI and HindIII and cloning into the multiple cloning site of the pBADHisB vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the waaK gene was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The template for PCR was pWQ315, and the primers used were 5′-TCAGGTTGAAGCAGCATTTTGCATGGTGGCTGTAGCAGCGATGGCAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-TGCCATCGCTGCTACAGCCACCATGCAAAATGCTGCTTCAACCTGAGATGGC-3′. The various constructs were verified by sequencing the complete open reading frame. From here, the resulting plasmid was digested with EcoRI and HindIII, and the fragment carrying waaK was cloned into the pBADHisB vector, adding an N-terminal His6 tag to the gene product. Plasmid pWQ322 was constructed by using the forward primer used to construct pWQ310 (see above) and the primer 5′-TGATCTCTAGATTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGTTTATTTCTTAGCGCCAGCAGAAAACCGGTAATG-3′ (XbaI) thus incorporating a C-terminal His6 tag in the waaLSARC1 gene product. Plasmid pWQ310 was used as template to amplify the waaL gene, and the fragment was digested with EcoRI and XbaI to facilitate cloning in pBAD24. In Vitro Mutagenesis and Gene Replacement—The cloned SARC 5, SARC 6, and CWG620 waaH genes were mutated by insertion of a gentamicin resistance cassette (aacC1) within the open reading frame. When cloned in the same transcriptional orientation as the target gene, the aacC1 cassette is nonpolar. Briefly, the waaH gene was cloned into the pBAD24 expression vector (pWQ307) and subsequently digested with BbsI, a restriction enzyme that cuts approximately in the middle of the waaH gene. The resulting sticky ends were filled in by using the Klenow fragment (Invitrogen). A SmaI fragment (containing the aacC1 gentamicin-resistance cassette) from the pUCGm plasmid was ligated to the linearized pWQ307. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and XbaI, and the waaH::aacC1 fragment was isolated and cloned into the temperature-sensitive suicide-delivery vector, pWQ173 (17Rahn A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 1045-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The pWQ173-derived knockout construct containing waaH::aacC1 was transformed into SARC 5, SARC 6, and CWG620. The strains were grown at the permissive temperature (30 °C) overnight. Cells were then collected, washed with saline, and plated on the selective media YEG-Cl at 45 °C (18Kast P. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 138: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Colonies were screened for chloramphenicol sensitivity and gentamicin resistance to select allelic exchange mutants. Chromosomal insertions were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Chromosomal waaK mutations were constructed in SARC 8 (CWG619) and SL3749 (CWG621) by using the plasmid pWQ306, a sucrose-sensitive pRE112 derivative (21Edwards R.A. Keller L.H. Schifferli D.M. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Plasmid pWQ306 carries an ∼700-bp fragment from the middle of the SARC 8 waaK gene (the waaK gene in SARC 8 is 95% homologous to the waaK gene in serovar Typhimurium). Plasmid pWQ306 was transferred by conjugation from E. coli SM10λpir into streptomycin-resistant derivatives of SARC 8 and SL3749. Chromosomal insertions resulted from a single crossover event and the integration of the plasmid through homologous recombination, mediated by the internal gene fragment. The mutants were selected on media containing streptomycin and chloramphenicol. A waaL chromosomal mutation also was made in SARC 6 (CWG620), using the pRE112 derivative pWQ305 and the method above. Briefly, a fragment of ∼500 bp from the middle of the SARC 6 waaL gene was amplified by PCR and cloned into pRE112. Plasmid pWQ305 was transferred by conjugation from E. coli SM10λpir into a streptomycin-resistant strain of SARC 6. A chromosomal insertion event was selected by plating on streptomycin and chloramphenicol. All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis of a PCR product spanning the insertion site. LPS Analysis by PAGE and Western Immunoblotting—Small scale LPS preparations were made from SDS-proteinase K whole cell lysates by the method of Hitchcock and Brown (22Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LPS was separated on 4–12% gradient NuPAGE gels that were obtained from NOVEX (San Diego, CA). PAGE conditions were those recommended by the manufacturer, and silver staining was performed as described elsewhere (23Tsai G.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using conventional methods (24Towbin M.T. Staehelin T. Gordon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The samples were probed using T6 monoclonal antibody (25Tsang R.S. Chan K.H. Chau P.Y. Wan K.C. Ng M.H. Schlecht S. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary antibody was a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the detection system was 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. Purification and Structural Analysis of CWG619 Core Oligosaccharide—Large scale LPS preparations were made using the phenol, chloroform, and petroleum ether method outlined elsewhere (26Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). The LPS backbone oligosaccharides were isolated by N,O-deacylation of 120 mg of LPS in 4 ml of 4 m KOH at 120 °C for 16 h (27Holst O. Thomas-Oates J.E. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The mixture was cooled and neutralized with 2 m HCl, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was desalted by gel chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Individual compounds from the N,O-deacylated LPS were isolated by high performance anion-exchange chromatography on a column (250 × 9 mm) of Carbopac PA1 that was eluted with a linear gradient of 10–80% 1 m sodium acetate in 0.1 m NaOH at a flow rate of 3 ml/min over 60 min. After desalting, oligosaccharides were isolated as single compounds in yields of 2–10 mg. Purified oligosaccharides were then analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR. Electrospray mass spectroscopy was carried out as described previously (28Vinogradov E. Korenevsky A. Beveridge T.J. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1285-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C in D2O on a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 instrument using acetone as reference (1H, 2.225 ppm, 13C, 31.45 ppm). Varian standard programs COSY, NOESY (mixing time of 300 ms), TOCSY (spinlock time of 120 ms), HSQC, and gHMBC (evolution delay of 100 ms) were used with digital resolution in F2 dimension <2 Hz/point. Spectra were assigned using the computer program Pronto (29Kjaer M. Andersen K.V. Poulsen F.M. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 288-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Immunoblotting of Proteins—Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and unbroken cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Membranes were isolated from the cell-free lysates by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min and were solubilized in SDS-containing sample buffer (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). In order to visualize the WaaL-His6 protein, it was essential to incubate the protein samples at 45 °C for 30 min. Higher temperatures resulted in no detection of the expressed protein, a phenomenon seen for some other bacterial integral membrane proteins (31Amer A.O. Valvano M.A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Dan N. Middleton R.B. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol.

Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE gels containing 12% acrylamide, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For Western immunoblotting, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, using conventional procedures (24Towbin M.T. Staehelin T. Gordon G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The anti-His6-antibody (H-3): sc-8036 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), was used to detect the His6-WaaK derivatives, and the Qiagen anti-His5 antibody was used to detect WaaL-His6. The second antibody was a goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and the detection system used was 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium. S. enterica sv. Typhimurium Requires a Terminal GlcNAc-1,2-GlcII Motif in the Core OS for O Antigen Ligation—In S. enterica sv. Typhimurium and E. coli R2, mutation of the waaK gene abolishes ligation of the O antigen (13Heinrichs D.E. Monteiro M.A. Perry M.B. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8849-8859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15MacLachlan P.R. Kadam S.K. Sanderson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7151-7163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of the O antigen may result from the GlcNAc-1,2-GlcII structure being essential for a ligation competent core OS. Alternatively, the WaaK protein itself may be required for essential protein-protein interactions in a functional ligation complex. To resolve this question, site-directed WaaK mutants were constructed, rendering the resulting GlcNAc transferase catalytically inactive without preventing synthesis of the WaaK protein. The WaaK glycosyltransferase is a member of family 4 in the CAZY glycosyltransferase classification system (afmb.cnrsmrs.fr/CAZY/index.html). Unfortunately, no solved structures are available to provide information regarding catalysis that could serve to guide the site-directed mutagenesis. However, family 4 glycosyltransferases do contain a conserved motif that includes a signature sequence (E(X7)E) shared"

https://openalex.org/W2001209571,"By lyophilization from 40% acetic acid solutions, bovine ribonuclease A forms several types of three-dimensional domain-swapped oligomers: dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order multimers. Each oligomeric species comprehends at least two conformers: one less basic and one more basic. The structures of the two dimers and one trimer have been solved. Plausible models have been proposed for the other oligomers. Among them, all chromatographic patterns show the constant presence of minority species, and we focused our attention on two of them. The first oligomer (named X) elutes between the two trimeric conformers; the second (named Y) elutes as a shoulder in the ascending limb of the more basic trimer. After purification with cationexchange chromatography, on the basis of (a) gel filtration analyses, (b) gel electrophoreses under nondenaturing conditions, (c) SDS-PAGE, (d) cross-linking experiments with divinylsulfone and 1,5-difluoro 2,4-dinitrobenzene, (e) enzymatic activity assays, (f) identification of the products of their spontaneous dissociation, and (g) controlled proteolysis with subtilisin, we propose that the X and Y oligomeric species contain two novel three-dimensional domain-swapped tetrameric conformers of RNase A, differing from each other as well as from the two tetramers already identified. For the two novel tetramers we showed tentative structural models. XTT could be a circular NCNC-tetramer; YTT could be a propeller-like C-trimer with an attached N-swapping monomer (NCCCTT), identical to a model proposed by Liu and Eisenberg (Liu, Y., and Eisenberg, D. (2002) Protein Sci. 11, 1285–1299). By lyophilization from 40% acetic acid solutions, bovine ribonuclease A forms several types of three-dimensional domain-swapped oligomers: dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher order multimers. Each oligomeric species comprehends at least two conformers: one less basic and one more basic. The structures of the two dimers and one trimer have been solved. Plausible models have been proposed for the other oligomers. Among them, all chromatographic patterns show the constant presence of minority species, and we focused our attention on two of them. The first oligomer (named X) elutes between the two trimeric conformers; the second (named Y) elutes as a shoulder in the ascending limb of the more basic trimer. After purification with cationexchange chromatography, on the basis of (a) gel filtration analyses, (b) gel electrophoreses under nondenaturing conditions, (c) SDS-PAGE, (d) cross-linking experiments with divinylsulfone and 1,5-difluoro 2,4-dinitrobenzene, (e) enzymatic activity assays, (f) identification of the products of their spontaneous dissociation, and (g) controlled proteolysis with subtilisin, we propose that the X and Y oligomeric species contain two novel three-dimensional domain-swapped tetrameric conformers of RNase A, differing from each other as well as from the two tetramers already identified. For the two novel tetramers we showed tentative structural models. XTT could be a circular NCNC-tetramer; YTT could be a propeller-like C-trimer with an attached N-swapping monomer (NCCCTT), identical to a model proposed by Liu and Eisenberg (Liu, Y., and Eisenberg, D. (2002) Protein Sci. 11, 1285–1299). Bovine ribonuclease A (EC 3.1.27.5) is a structurally and functionally versatile protein. By lyophilization from 40% acetic acid solutions according to the classic procedure of Crestfield et al. (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem.

However, the enzyme protein also aggregates under various different experimental conditions, all excluding the lyophilization step (5Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By any type of procedure, each oligomer consists of at least two conformational isomers that can be separated by cation-exchange chromatography (Fig. 1) as a less basic and a more basic species (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The molecular structures of the two dimers have been solved (6Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P.

Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). They are three-dimensional domain-swapped dimers. In the less basic dimer each subunit swaps its N terminus (residues 1–15), which comprises an α-helix (residues 3–13) (Fig. 2A, PDB entry 1A2W) (6Liu Y. Hart P.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3437-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar); the more basic or major dimer forms by the swapping of the C-terminal β-strand (residues 116–124) of each monomer (Fig. 2B, PDB entry 1F0V) (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). They were called N-dimer (ND) and C-dimer (CD), respectively (5Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the latter being three to four times more abundant than the former when obtained with the lyophilization procedure (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but changing and even inverting its relative proportions when produced under experimental conditions that exclude the lyophilization step (5Gotte G. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10763-10769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A very plausible linear model was proposed for the less basic or major trimeric conformer on the basis of its dissociation products and of cross-linking experiments involving its lysine residues (7Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D.

Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): two monomers bind to each other by swapping their N termini, and a third monomer is bound to one of them by a C-terminal domain swapping (Fig. 2C). It has been called the NC-trimer (NCT) (10Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The more basic trimer was crystallized and its structure solved (8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It consists of three monomers linked to each other by swapping their C-terminal β-strands, therefore forming a circular, propeller-like structure (Fig. 2D, PDB entry 1JS0). For this trimer a flower cup-like model had previously been shown (Fig. 2E) (8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This oligomer was named C-trimer (CT) (10Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two linear structures for the two tetramers, the less basic or minor and the more basic or major, have also been proposed on the basis of their chromatographic behavior and dissociation products (9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The first could consist of a central C-dimer, to each subunit of which a monomer is attached by the N-terminal type of swapping (Fig. 2F). The second could have a central N-dimer, to both subunits of which a monomer binds by a C-terminal domain-swapping mechanism (Fig. 2G). They have been called the NCN-tetramer (NCNTT) and the CNC-tetramer (CNCTT), respectively (10Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Two additional models for the tetrameric aggregates of RNase A have been proposed by Liu and Eisenberg (11Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). One of them consists of a circular flower cup-like structure with each monomer swapping its C terminus; the other is a C-trimer with a fourth monomer swapping its N terminus with that of one subunit of the trimer. All the characterized RNase A oligomers have composite active sites (His-12, His-119, Lys-41), are enzymatically active on 2′,3′-cyclic cytidylate (1Crestfield A.M. Stein W.H. Moore S. Arch. Biochem.

X elutes as a small peak between the two trimers; Y, originally called AA (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), elutes as a shoulder in the ascending limb of the more basic trimer. The results obtained allow us to propose that the minority species considered here contain two novel tetrameric forms of RNase A. The structure of one of them could be identical to one of the two models shown by Liu and Eisenberg (11Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Materials—Ribonuclease A from bovine pancreas (Type XII-A), subtilisin Carlsberg, type VIII (from Bacillus Licheniformis), trypsin from bovine pancreas (l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated), yeast RNA, and poly(A)·poly(U) were purchased from Sigma. DFDNB (1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) was from Fluka Product. Divinylsulfone was from Sigma. Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Acetic acid was from Merck. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available. Chromatographic experiments were performed with an Amersham Biosciences FPLC system, using Superdex 75 or 200 HR 10/30 or Superdex 75 10/300 columns (Amersham Biosciences) for gel filtration and Source 15S HR 10/10, 16/10, or 16/50 columns (Amersham Biosciences) for ion-exchange chromatography. Samples were concentrated, partially desalted, or dialyzed against the appropriate buffer using Centriplus and/or Centricon 3 or 10 ultrafilters purchased from Millipore. Ion-exchange Chromatography—First separation and analysis of the various RNase A multimeric aggregates were performed under conditions identical to those described elsewhere (Ref. 4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; see also the legend to Fig. 1). Gel Filtration—X and Y oligomers were accumulated, concentrated, and gel-filterered with a Superdex 75 or 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated with 0.2 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, at 23 °C. Elution was performed with the same buffer at a flow rate ranging from 0.01 to 0.10 ml per min, at 23 °C. The trimeric and tetrameric species were separated, collected, concentrated, and used for further analyses after dialysis against appropriate buffers. Gel Electrophoresis—(a) SDS-PAGE was carried out with 12.5 or 18% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were run at 20 mA for 90–120 min at 23 °C. Staining was performed with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. (b) Cathodic gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions was performed according to Goldenberg (12Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, IRL Press, Oxford, UK1989: 225-250Google Scholar) with slight modifications (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using a β-alanine/acetic acid buffer, pH 4.0. 8, 10, or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels were run at 20 mA for 100–120 min at 4 °C. Fixing and staining were performed with 12.5% trichloroacetic acid and 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The identification of the aggregates was performed by comparison of their Rf values with those of the standard aggregates previously characterized. Cross-linking Experiments—(a) Cross-linking with divinylsulfone (DVS) was done according to the method outlined by Ciglic et al. (13Ciglic M.J. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Rauf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but slightly modified (see legend to Fig. 5); histidine residues of the aggregated species under study were cross-linked using the procedure described in (9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to ascertain that aggregation occurred by three-dimensional domain swapping. (b) Cross-linking with DFDNB was used to cross-link Lys-7 and Lys-41, following the protocol used by Lin et al. (14Lin S.H. Konishi Y. Dentor M.E. Sheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNase A and the various dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric aggregates were dialyzed against 50 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5, and concentrated to 0.45–0.50 mg/ml in a final volume of about 1 ml. 10 μl of 0.5 mg/ml DFDNB in 2% (v/v) methanol solution (about 1 μg of cross-linker/100 μg of protein species) were added every 30 min over a period of 3 h to the RNase A solutions that were stirred in the dark at 23 °C (8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The stirring continued for 20 more hours in the dark before the reaction was quenched by adding a few microliters of glacial acetic acid to adjust the pH to 3.0. The reaction mixtures were concentrated against sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, and subjected to cation-exchange chromatography as described above. Analyses of the DFDNB-cross-linked oligomers were performed by injecting each sample in a Source 15S HR 10/10 column, pre-equilibrated with 0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, and applying a linear gradient to rise the sodium phosphate concentration from 0.02 to 0.20 m in 90 min. Assays for Enzymatic Activity—Ribonuclease activity on bakers' yeast RNA was determined using the protocol of Kunitz (15Kunitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 164: 563-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activity on double-stranded poly(A)·poly(U) was determined following the procedure of Libonati and Sorrentino (16Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 234-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) but slightly modified: SSC (0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) was used instead of MOPS, pH 7.5. All assays were performed at 23 °C. Thermal Dissociation Experiments—The gel-filtered samples, at a concentration of 0.7–1.0 mg/ml in 0.03 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, were incubated at 35 °C for time intervals between 1 and 72 h (9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). At the times indicated, small aliquots containing 20 μg of each sample were withdrawn, cooled in an ice bath, and analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis using the previously well characterized RNase A multimers as standards. Limited Proteolysis with Subtilisin—Time-dependent (2–120 min) digestions of the RNase A oligomers with subtilisin Carlsberg, type VIII, were performed under controlled conditions at 5 °C, according to Doscher (17Doscher M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 640-648Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and essentially as already described for the RNase A dimers (18Nenci A. Gotte G. Maras B. Libonati M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1545: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The action of subtilisin was interrupted by adding phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1.5 mm, final concentration) without using 1 n HCl. Purification and analysis of the products were performed by gel filtration and/or nondenaturing PAGE using the undigested oligomers as standards. Ion-exchange Chromatography and Gel Filtration—Appropriate amounts of the X and Y species were obtained in repeated cation-exchange chromatographies performed as described (Ref. 4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar; see also legend to Fig. 1). The elution positions of X and Y (Fig. 1) make purification quite difficult. No satisfactory results were obtained by modifying the chromatographic conditions (pH and/or ionic strength). A satisfactory separation was obtained by gel filtration. Using three different resins (see “Experimental Procedures”), the nature of the various eluted species was established by comparison with the known, well characterized RNase A multimers (ND, CD, NCT, CT, NCNTT, and CNCTT), used here as standards. The results obtained, shown in Table I and Fig. 3, indicate that both X and Y contain a tetramer and possibly also a trimeric species. They also contain small amounts of dimeric and monomeric RNase A (see Fig. 3), which can be ascribed to partial dissociation of the larger oligomers (9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Higher molecular weight species are also present; they could be small amounts of pentamers and possibly larger oligomers (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The putative tetramer and trimer present in X and Y will be called here X-tetramer (XTT) and X-trimer (XT), Y-tetramer (YTT), and Y-trimer (YT), respectively (see Table I). The possible presence of a trimer is reasonable considering that in the ion-exchange pattern of Fig. 1, X and NCT elute quite close to each other, and Y elutes as a shoulder of the ascending limb of the CT peak. In other words, both X and Y can be quite easily contaminated by the two already known RNase A trimers. Instead, both X and Y elute (Fig. 1) fairly far from the two known tetramers (NCNTT and CNCTT), so that it is unlikely that they could be contaminated by them.Table IElution volumes of the X and Y species determined with three different gel filtration columnsElution volumeGel filtration columnStandard oligomersUnknown speciesCNCTTNCNTTCTNCTXTTYTTXTYTmlmlSuperdex 200 HR 10/30 column13.65 ± 0.0714.05 ± 0.0614.58 ± 0.0814.61 ± 0.0714.05 ± 0.0614.09 ± 0.0414.54 ± 0.0614.57 ± 0.04Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column10.03 ± 0.0310.34 ± 0.0310.86 ± 0.0410.79 ± 0.0610.39 ± 0.0810.50 ± 0.0410.83 ± 0.0810.88 ± 0.06Superdex 75 10/300 column9.36 ± 0.049.63 ± 0.0310.16 ± 0.0510.11 ± 0.069.57 ± 0.049.61 ± 0.0410.14 ± 0.0510.15 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Gel Electrophoresis Experiments—Fig. 4A shows the results of an analysis of the four unknown species that were subjected, side-by-side with other well characterized RNase A oligomers, to a 12.5% PAGE under nondenaturing conditions; XTT and YTT display electrophoretic mobilities slightly but clearly lower than those displayed by NCNTT and CNCTT. The slowest band appearing in the CNCTT lane can be a higher order oligomer (pentamer?) as already observed elsewhere (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). On the basis of the substantially similar mobilities of the four species, we propose that XTT and YTT could be additional tetrameric oligomers of RNase A, different from the already characterized NCNTT and CNCTT tetramers (4Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used (12.5% acrylamide) no differences between XTT and YTT could be detected, but analyses performed with 8% acrylamide nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. 4B) indicate that the two oligomers migrate with electrophoretic mobilities clearly different from each other, as well as from those of NCNTT and CNCTT. In conclusion, XTT and YTT appear to be two novel tetramers of RNase A differing from the two tetramers previously characterized but also from each other. As for the putative trimeric components (XT and YT) of the original X and Y species (see previous paragraph), the electrophoretic analyses of Fig. 4A show that XT and YT contain three main bands. The bands endowed with the slowest mobility in the XT and YT lanes could be the XTT and YTT tetramers present as contaminants. The middle band present in the XT lane has an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of the NCT, and the very dense, fast-migrating band in the YT lane has a mobility identical to that of the CT. Therefore, these bands can just correspond to the two well characterized NCT and CT trimers, present as contaminants. However, both XT and YT show a third band that must be identified. In the XT lane this band, the fast migrating one, has a mobility identical to that of the C-trimer; in the YT lane the middle band shows a mobility identical to that of the NC-trimer. Therefore, these two components of XT and YT could be considered, again, as trivial contaminations by the two known RNase A trimers, CT and NCT. Also an additional, scarcely visible band is present in the YT lane, whose mobility is slightly lower than that of the dense, fastest band. Its nature is unknown. Cross-linking with DVS—To ascertain whether the two putative novel tetramers are domain-swapped oligomers, they were cross-linked with DVS, following the procedure outlined by Ciglic et al. (13Ciglic M.J. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Rauf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and already used to characterize the RNase A trimers and tetramers (9Nenci A. Gotte G. Bertoldi M. Libonati M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2017-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). DVS selectively reacts with two histidine residues located at the appropriate distance. In RNase A a preferential binding occurs between His-12 (in the N terminus) and His-119 (in the C terminus). In all three-dimensional domain-swapped oligomers of RNase A the DVS cross-linkage should involve His-12 of one subunit and His-119 of another subunit. If aggregation were not due to a three-dimensional domain-swapping mechanism, DVS should link the His-12 and His-119 of a same monomer (13Ciglic M.J. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Rauf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, the analysis performed with SDS-PAGE should show oligomers in the first case and only monomers in the second case. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 5, A and B, where the kinetics of the cross-linking reaction of XTT and YTT with DVS is shown. The dimers and trimers appearing in the gel derive from partially cross-linked tetramers that partly dissociate upon treatment with SDS. Their amounts increase in time. These species correspond to an RNase A dimer, a trimer, and finally a tetramer, with a definite increase of the latter during the time course of the reaction (0–288 h). The amount of monomeric RNase A regularly decreases between 0 and 208 h of reaction. It is worth pointing out that the splitting of the bands is a side effect of the reaction, as described by Ciglic et al. (13Ciglic M.J. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Rauf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking with DFDNB—The reaction of RNase A oligomers with DFDNB is appropriate to ascertain whether the oligomers are formed by an N-terminal or a C-terminal domain-swapping mechanism. DFDNB cross-links lysine residues, in particular Lys-7 and Lys-41 in RNase A, as described by Lin et al. (14Lin S.H. Konishi Y. Dentor M.E. Sheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5504-5512Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This reaction could bind different subunits of an oligomer only if they swap their N termini. On the contrary, if DFDNB reacts with only C-terminal-swapped oligomers, the product should be an intrasubunit cross-linkage. The two different products can be detected by gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, or SDS-PAGE. Two negative aspects, however, affect the analysis of the RNase A oligomers: (i) the aggregates could partially dissociate during the time-course of the reaction, and (ii) several side-products can form. To overcome these difficulties, individual ion-exchange chromatographies of the mixtures containing the oligomer resulting after DFDNB cross-linking were performed. The relative patterns were superimposed and are shown in Fig. 6, A and B. On the basis of previous results (8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), besides several unidentifiable side products of the reaction, some of the peaks could be identified and are indicated in Fig. 6, A and B. Among them, one peak, eluting at 0.11 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.4, was found in the elution patterns of the N-dimer (Fig. 6, A and B), NC-trimer (Fig. 6A), NCNTT and CNCTT (Fig. 6B) but not in the patterns of monomeric RNase A, C-dimer and C-trimer (Fig. 6A). This peak has been called clD (cross-linked dimer) and consists of an intersubunit dimer formed by the cross-linkage of Lys-7 of the swapped N terminus of one subunit and Lys-41 belonging to the other subunit (8Liu Y. Gotte G. Libonati M. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus ("
https://openalex.org/W2007198287,"Doppel (Dpl) is the first described homologue of the prion protein, the main constituent of the agent responsible for prion diseases. The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) is predominantly present in the central nervous system. Although its role is not yet completely clarified, PrP(C) seems to be involved in Cu(2+) recycling from synaptic clefts and in preventing neuronal oxidative damage. Conversely, Dpl is expressed in heart and testis and has been shown to regulate male fertility by intervening in gametogenesis and sperm-egg interactions. Therefore, despite a high sequence homology and a similar three-dimensional fold, the functions of PrP(C) and Dpl appear unrelated. Here we show by electron paramagnetic resonance and fluorescence spectroscopy that the in vitro binding of copper(II) to human recombinant Dpl occurs with a different pattern from that observed for recombinant PrP. At physiological pH values, two copper(II)-binding sites with different affinities were found in Dpl. At lower pH values, two additional copper(II)-binding sites can be identified as follows: one complex is present only at pH 4, and the other is observed in the pH range 5-6. As derived from the electron paramagnetic resonance characteristics, all Dpl-copper(II) complexes have a different coordination sphere from those present in PrP. Furthermore, in contrast to the effect shown previously for PrP(C), addition of Cu(2+) to Dpl-expressing cells does not cause Dpl internalization. These results suggest that binding of the ion to PrP(C) and Dpl may contribute to the different functional roles ascribed to these highly homologous proteins."

We have previously reported that the activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) is required for the retinoic acid-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells. However, the signaling pathway(s) responsible for the activation of JNK has not been known. In this study, we demonstrated that activities of MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) and TAK1, one of the upstream kinases of MKK4, were enhanced in the neurally differentiating cells. Inhibition of the neural differentiation by an overexpression of protein phosphatase 2Cϵ, an inactivator of TAK1, suggested a critical role of the TAK1 signaling pathway during the differentiation. Confocal microscopic analysis indicated that TAK1, phospho-MKK4, and phospho-JNK were colocalized with tubulin in the neurites and localized also in the nuclei of the differentiating cells. In contrast, two TAK1-binding proteins, TAB1 and TAB2, which are involved in the activation of TAK1, were localized in the neurites and the nuclei of the differentiating cells, respectively. These results suggest that two distinct TAK1-MKK4-JNK signaling pathways are independently activated at the different intracellular locations and may participate in the regulation of the neural differentiation of P19 cells.

P19 cells resemble the inner cell mass of early embryo and can differentiate to primitive endoderm-like cells, neuroectoderm-like cells, or muscle-like cells depending on the culture conditions (17Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W.

Expression of Gα12 and Gα13 subunits of the heterotrimeric G-protein is enhanced in the course of RA-induced primitive endodermal differentiation of P19 cells. Overexpression of the constitutively active form of Gα12 activated JNK and induced primitive endodermal differentiation, even in the absence of RA treatment (20Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, expression of a dominant negative mutant of JNK suppressed the RA-induced primitive endodermal differentiation of P19 cells, indicating that JNK plays a pivotal role in the differentiation (20Jho E.H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24461-24467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been reported that MEKK4 mediated JNK activation and differentiation of P19 cells to endoderm-like cells (23Kanungo J. Potapova I. Malbon C.C. Wang H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24032-24039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).We have previously reported that the activation of JNK was also required for the RA-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells (22Wang H. Ikeda S. Kanno S. Li M.G. Ohnishi M. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the upstream signaling pathway responsible for the activation of JNK in the course of the neutral differentiation has not been elucidated. Here, we present evidence indicating that activity levels of MKK4 and TAK1 are enhanced in the neurally differentiating cells and that expression of protein phosphatase 2Cϵ (PP2Cϵ), an inactivator of TAK1 (24Li M.G.

Although TAK1, phospho-MKK4, and phospho-JNK were localized in both the nuclei and the neurites of the neurally differentiating cells, two adapter proteins involved in the activation of TAK1 were differently localized, suggesting that two TAK1-MKK4-JNK signaling pathways are independently activated at the different intracellular locations and may participate in the regulation of the neural differentiation of P19 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—JNK1 rabbit polyclonal antibody and MKK4 rabbit polyclonal antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-MKK7 rabbit polyclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. E. Nishida (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). Phospho-specific JNK rabbit antibody and phospho-specific SEK1/MKK4 rabbit antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-TAK1, anti-TAB1, and anti-TAB2 antibodies were already described (25Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Anti-α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat antimouse IgG was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Cell Culture and Neural Differentiation—P19 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. For neural differentiation, P19 cells were cultured in medium containing 1 μm RA in a bacterial grade culture dish for 4 days, and then the aggregates were plated onto a tissue culture grade dish as a monolayer and cultured for another 3 days in the absence of RA. For osmotic shock, undifferentiated P19 cells were incubated with medium supplemented with 0.7 m NaCl for 15 min at 37 °C.Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—P19 cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies (1 μg) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by incubation with 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4FF beads for 1 h. The beads were then washed three times with the lysis buffer. Activities of MKKs and JNK were determined using His-JNK3 (K55R) and GST-c-Jun, respectively, as the substrates (22Wang H. Ikeda S.

Expression of Myc-PP2Cϵ was examined using anti-Myc antibody.Indirect Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence, cells were cultured on a poly-l-lysine-coated cover glass (Asahi Techno Glass, Tokyo, Japan) and then fixed for 15 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, blocked for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% (v/v) normal goat serum, and subsequently incubated with the indicated first antibodies for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cover glass was prepared for immunofluorescence by mounting in VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The cells were examined by confocal microscopy with a Zeiss LSM410 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany).RESULTSMKK4 Is Selectively Activated in the Course of RA-induced Neural Differentiation of P19 Cells—We have previously shown that the activation of JNK was required for the RA-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells using a dominant negative mutant of JNK (22Wang H. Ikeda S. Kanno S. Li M.G. Ohnishi M. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of the JNK activation was not clear. Therefore, we investigated the upstream signaling pathways of JNK in the P19 cells before and after the induction of neural differentiation. We compared the activities of MKK4 and MKK7, which are known to be the physiological activators of JNK, of the neurally differentiating cells with those of the undifferentiated or stress-treated cells. To determine the MKK4 and MKK7 activities of cell extracts, an immune complex kinase assay was performed using a kinase-negative mutant of JNK (His-JNK (K55R)) as the substrate. Interestingly, only MKK4 was substantially activated in the neurally differentiating cells, whereas both MKK4 and MKK7 were activated in response to stress (Fig. 1, b and c). MKK4 itself is known to be activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases. Concomitant with the activation of MKK4, an increase in phosphorylation of MKK4 in the neurally differentiating cells was observed (Fig. 1d). In parallel with the activation of MKK4, JNK was also activated during the neural differentiation, confirming our previous observation (Fig. 1a) (22Wang H. Ikeda S. Kanno S. Li M.G. Ohnishi M. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The degree of the activation of JNK in the neurally differentiating cells was similar to that induced by the addition of NaCl to the medium. These results indicated that MKK4, but not MKK7, was the major activator of JNK during the neural differentiation.TAK1 Is Activated in the Neurally Differentiating Cells—We were interested in identifying the MKKK that is responsible for the phosphorylation and activation of MKK4 in the neurally differentiating cells. Recently, a number of MKKKs that phosphorylate and activate MKK4 have been reported (9Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Johnson G.L. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Using Northern blot analysis, we first examined whether the mRNA levels of MEKK1, MEKK3, MEKK4/MTK1, ASK1, and TAK1 increased in the course of the differentiation. The results demonstrated that there was little difference in the expression levels of MEKK1, MEKK3, MEKK4/MTK1, and ASK1 between the undifferentiated cells and the neurally differentiating cells (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the expression level of TAK1 was substantially increased in the neurally differentiating cells (Fig. 2a). Therefore, we determined whether the protein level of TAK1 was also increased in accordance with the neural differentiation. TAK1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody from the cell lysates of undifferentiated and neurally differentiating cells. Immunoblot analysis using the anti-TAK1 antibody demonstrated that the TAK1 protein level was indeed enhanced in the neurally differentiating cells (Fig. 2b, upper panel). It has been established that TAB1, a TAK1-binding protein, associates with TAK1 and induces the activation of TAK1 by autophosphorylation in the cells (25Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Upon the activation of TAK1, TAB1 is phosphorylated. It is also known that TAB2, another TAK1-binding protein that mediates interleukin-1-induced signaling to TAK1, is also phosphorylated concomitant with the activation of TAK1 in vivo (28Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the endogenous TAB1 by TAK1 can be monitored by its mobility shifts on Western blot analysis. Using this method, we determined whether phosphorylation of TAB1 by TAK1 is enhanced in the neurally differentiating cells. TAK1/TAB1 complex was first immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts with anti-TAK1 antibody and probed with anti-TAB1 antibody on immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2b, lower panel). An enhanced mobility shift of TAB1 was observed in the neurally differentiating cells, and this mobility shift was cancelled by the incubation of the immunoprecipitates with bacterial λ-phosphatase (Fig. 2d, left panel), indicating that the mobility shift was indeed caused by the enhanced phosphorylation of TAB1. Similar to TAB1, an increased mobility shift of TAB2 of the neurally differentiating cells was observed, which was also cancelled by the phosphatase treatment of the cell extracts (Fig. 2, c and d). Collectively, these observations indicate that TAK1 was activated in the neurally differentiating cells.Fig. 2TAK1 is activated in the neurally differentiating P19 cells. a, total RNA was prepared from the duplicated dishes of the undifferentiated P19 cells (indicated as Undif.) and the neurally differentiating cells (indicated as Neural). RNA was separated on an agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to nylon membrane, and probed with 32P-labeled cDNAs as indicated (upper panels). The membranes were deprobed and reprobed with 32P-labeled cDNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) to indicate equal loading of RNA samples (lower panels). b, aliquots of the cell extracts (0.5 mg of protein) from the undifferentiated (lanes 1 and 3) and the neurally differentiating cells (lanes 2 and 4) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with normal rabbit IgG (indicated by IgG) or anti-TAK1 antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TAK1 (upper panel) and anti-TAB1 (lower panel) antibodies. WB, Western blot. c, the lysates (10 μg) from the undifferentiated and neurally differentiating cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TAB2 antibody. d, the immunoprecipitates obtained from the neurally differentiating cells (panel b, lane 4) were incubated without (–) or with (+) λ-phosphatase (λ-phos) for 1 h and then immunoblotted with anti-TAB1 antibody (left panel). The lysates (10 μg) of the neurally differentiating cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TAB2 antibody before and after λ-phosphatase treatment (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PP2Cϵ Suppresses the Neural Differentiation of P19 Cells— We have recently reported that PP2Cϵ, a member of protein phosphatase 2C family, inactivated the SAPK signaling pathway by selectively associating with and dephosphorylating TAK1 (24Li M.G.

PP2Cϵ gave no influence on the phosphorylation levels of the downstream components of TAK1 such as MKK4 and JNK. To test whether the activation of the TAK1 signaling pathway is required for the neural differentiation of P19 cells, we expressed PP2Cϵ stably in P19 cells and determined the effect of PP2Cϵ expression on the differentiation. The results demonstrated that the neural differentiation was markedly suppressed by the expression of PP2Cϵ (Fig. 3, a and b). Interestingly, expression level of endogenous PP2Cϵ mRNA was substantially enhanced at day 4 (aggregation culture) of the RA-induced neural differentiation process of P19 cells, and the expression was further enhanced at day 7 (Fig. 3c).Fig. 3PP2Cϵ suppresses the neural differentiation of P19 cells. a, empty vector (lane 1) or expression plasmid of Myc-tagged PP2Cϵ (lane 2) was stably transfected to P19 cells, and the expressed proteins were detected with anti-Myc antibody. b, P19 stable transfectants (left panel, empty vector; right panel, PP2Cϵ expression vector) were treated with 1 μm RA and immunostained with anti-tubulin antibody. c, P19 cells (day 0) were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 μm RA on a bacterial grade culture dish for 4 days and then grown on a tissue culture grade dish containing medium without RA for another 3 days. Total mRNAs were prepared at days 0, 4, and 7, and Northern blot analysis was carried out using PP2Cϵ cDNA (upper panel) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (lower panel) as the probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TAB1 and TAB2 Are Differentially Localized in the Neurally Differentiating Cells—We performed confocal microscopic analysis to determine the subcellular localization of phospho-JNK and phospho-MKK4 in the cells before and during neural differentiation. Both phospho-JNK and phospho-MKK4 were localized exclusively in the nucleus in the undifferentiated P19 cells (data not shown). In contrast, in the neurally differentiating cells, both the phospho-JNK and the phospho-MKK4 were colocalized with tubulin in the neurites (Fig. 4, a and b). Both of them were also detected in the nuclei, although the signals of phospho-JNK in the nuclei were much weaker than those in the neurites.Fig. 4Subcellular localization of phospho-JNK, phospho-MKK4, TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in the neurally differentiating P19 cells. a–e, P19 cells during neural differentiation were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and the proteins were detected using specific antibodies as indicated followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The cells were double-stained with anti-tubulin antibody followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. Hoechst 33258 dye was used to show the nuclei. The scale bar indicates 25 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Studies of subcellular localization of TAK1, TAB1, and TAB2 in the neurally differentiating cells revealed that, whereas TAK1 was colocalized with tubulin in the neurites and also localized in the cell nuclei (Fig. 4c), TAB1 was predominantly colocalized with tubulin in the neurites (Fig. 4d), and TAB2 was mainly localized in the nuclei of the neurally differentiating cells (Fig. 4e).DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigated the signaling pathway responsible for the sustained activation of JNK, which is required for the RA-induced neural differentiation of P19 cells. We observed the enhanced activities of JNK, MKK4, and TAK1 in the neurally differentiating cells (Figs. 1 and 2). All of these proteins were colocalized with tubulin in the neurites and also localized in the cell nuclei (Fig. 4). These observations suggest that the TAK1-MKK4 signaling pathway participates in the activation of JNK in the course of neural differentiation of P19 cells. Recently, we have shown that PP2Cϵ interacted selectively with TAK1 and inactivated it by dephosphorylation (24Li M.G. Katsura K. Nomiyama H. Komaki K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12013-12021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). PP2Cϵ did not dephosphorylate downstream components of TAK1 such as MKK4/7 and JNK/p38. These results suggested that PP2Cϵ acts as a specific inactivator of TAK1 in the SAPK signaling pathway. Inhibition of the neural differentiation of P19 cells by overexpression of PP2Cϵ supports the idea that the activation of TAK1 plays an important role in the differentiation (Fig. 3b). The observation that PP2Cϵ mRNA level increases in the course of differentiation may suggest that endogenous PP2Cϵ indeed participates in the fine regulation of the phosphorylation level of TAK1 during the differentiation (Fig. 3c).Interestingly, two endogenous TAK1-binding proteins were differently localized in the neurally differentiating cells. Thus, TAB1 was colocalized with tubulin in the neurites, and TAB2 was mainly localized in the cell nuclei (Fig. 4, d and e). TAB1 and TAB2 have been reported to participate in the tumor growth factor-β family and interleukin-1-induced activations of TAK1, respectively (15Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K.

Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Both the membranous and the nuclear localizations of TAB2 have been reported previously (30Takaesu G.

Therefore, the different subcellular localization of TAB1 and TAB2 in the neurally differentiating cells may indicate that JNKs in the neurites and the cell nuclei are independently activated by two different TAK1 signaling pathways, each activated by different extracellular stimulus.The sustained activation of JNK has also been reported in the differentiating cerebellar granule neurons of rats, although both MKK4 and MKK7 were activated in this case (32Coffey E.T.

https://openalex.org/W2033330138,"Cre is a site-specific recombinase from bacteriophage P1. It is a member of the tyrosine integrase family and catalyzes reciprocal recombination between specific 34-bp sites called loxP. To analyze the structure-function relationships of this enzyme, we performed large scale pentapeptide insertional mutagenesis to generate insertions of five amino acids at random positions in the protein. The high density of insertion mutations into Cre allowed us to identify an unexpected degree of functional tolerance to insertions into the 4-5 β-hairpin and into the loop between helices J and K (both of which contact the DNA in the minor groove) and also into helix A. The phenotypes of the majority of inserts allowed us to confirm a variety of predictions made on the basis of sequence conservation, known three-dimensional structure, and proposed catalytic mechanism. In particular, most insertions into conserved regions or secondary structure elements inactivated Cre, and most insertions located in nonconserved, unstructured regions preserved Cre activity. Less expectedly, the non-conserved and poorly structured loops and linkers between helices A-B, E-F, and M-N did not tolerate insertions, thus identifying these as critical regions for recombinase activity. We purified and characterized in vitro several representatives of these “unexpected” Cre insertion mutants. The role of those regions in the recombination process is discussed.

The phage P1 Cre recombinase is a member of the tyrosine integrase family of site-specific recombinases whose members use a conserved tyrosine residue as a catalytic nucleophile. Molecular analysis of Cre has provided a wealth of biochemical and structural information on recombination mechanisms, and this enzyme is also extensively used for engineering chromosomes of higher eukaryotes. The Cre protein catalyzes precise recombination between two copies of its target sequence, the 34-bp loxP site. Two Cre molecules bind specifically to a single loxP site, and a pair of such Cre-occupied loxP sites come together to form a synaptic complex. A Holliday junction intermediate is then produced by cleavage and subsequent religation of DNA strands, followed by isomerization, cleavage, and religation of crossing DNA strands to form the recombination products (1Grainge I.

Details regarding the functional determinants of DNA recognition and binding, DNA bending, synapse formation, and partner subunit activation all remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, characterization of Cre mutants with single amino acid substitutions have identified a number of important amino acid residues involved in catalysis, DNA binding and bending, and synapse complex formation (10Sternberg N.

To complement and extend the multiple crystallographic studies and comparative sequence analyses, we built a functional map of Cre using random pentapeptide insertion mutagenesis (15Cao Y. Hallet B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2777-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in combination with powerful genetic selections. While the majority of the phenotypes of mutant recombinases confirmed predictions based on a comparative analysis of sequence and the crystal structure of Cre, several classes of mutants exhibited unexpected properties. Surprisingly, insertions into a number of secondary structural elements likely to be important for Cre function (4-5 β-hairpin, the loop between helices J and K, both of which contact DNA in the minor groove, and also helix A) did not disrupt recombinase activity. Conversely, insertions into the non-conserved and poorly structured loops and linkers between helices A-B, E-F, and M-N were unexpectedly deleterious. Construction of a Cre Library with Random Pentapeptide Insertions—Random pentapeptide insertions into cre were generated using the Mutation Generation System™ (Finnzymes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an artificial Mu transposon was randomly inserted in vitro into the 5657-bp ApR plasmid pBS809, a derivative of pBAD18 (19Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar) in which cre is under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter, and transformed into DH5α (Invitrogen) to yield 3 × 105 independent colonies. Assuming random Mu transposition, this represents about a 75-fold excess of insertion events into the ∼4000 non-essential bp of this plasmid. The 1067-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment containing Mu insertions and the coding sequence of Cre was subcloned into pBAD18 vector followed by deletion of the Mu transposon by NotI digest, religation, and retransformation to yield the final pentapeptide insertion library. A minimum of 105 independent cre plasmid colonies (100× coverage) was maintained throughout subsequent steps to ensure maximal representation of insertions within the 1067-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment containing 1029 bp of the cre coding sequence. To confirm the randomness of the insertions we sequenced 184 independent transformants. Aside from several short regions without insertions, probably because of some low level bias in target selection by MuA transposase (20Haapa-Paananen S. Rita H. Savilahti H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2843-2851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or possible toxicity of the cre mutants to the host, the pattern of insertions appeared nearly random. Cre Mutant Selection—Insertion mutants of Cre that retain recombinase activity were selected by their ability to excise a loxP-flanked transcription terminator (12Rüfer A.W. Sauer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2764-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that prevents expression of a neo gene. Briefly, the expression library of Cre mutants was electroporated into DH5α [pBS848], where pBS848 is a pACYC-based CmR plasmid carrying the loxP2 rrnB T1T2 terminator cassette inserted between the neo gene and a lac promoter. Electroporation and selection for kanamycin resistance was as described (12Rüfer A.W. Sauer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2764-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) except cre was induced for only 1 h with 0.20% l-arabinose. Resulting ApR CmR KnR colonies were pooled, plasmid DNA was purified, and to minimize contamination by carryover the selection procedure was repeated two more times. Digestion of DNA with NcoI before retransformation eliminated the loxP plasmid while retaining the mutant Cre-expressing plasmids, which have no NcoI sites. In the absence of cre the frequency of KnR colonies was less than 1 × 10-5. A modification of the above procedure, namely the omission of the arabinose induction step to lower the level of Cre expression, shortened the time window available for recombination and therefore allowed us to generate a second sublibrary enriched for highly active mutants. A sublibrary of inactive cre mutants was selected using Escherichia coli strain NS2300 (10Sternberg N. Sauer B. Hoess R. Abremski K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). This strain contains a neo gene flanked by loxP sites in the chromosome. Thus, only transformants with an inactive cre gene remain KnR. Electroporation and selection was as above with 1 h of induction with 0.20% l-arabinose. The background frequency of KnR was 0.04% as determined by transformation with a wt cre pBAD18 plasmid indicating high efficiency of neo gene excision. Plasmid DNA was purified, and a second round of selection was imposed to eliminate carryover contamination from any active Cre mutants that might have survived the first round of selection. Protein Purification—Cre protein and its mutants were expressed to high levels in E. coli BL21(DE3) LysS using a T7 expression system, and then purified to homogeneity and stored as described previously (12Rüfer A.W. Sauer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2764-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The concentrations of wt and mutant Cre proteins were determined by spectrophotometry at 280 nm using a ϵ280 for wt Cre of 1.17 × 10-5m-1 cm-1 (21Mack A. Sauer B. Abremski K. Hoess R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4451-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cre was diluted to a working concentration of 1 μm in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and 100 ng/μl bovine serum albumin prior to use in vitro. Recombination in Vitro—For recombination in vitro, the 6.8-kb loxP2 plasmid pBS835 was cleaved with BglI and NotI to generate two DNA fragments (4.2 and 2.6 kb) with one loxP site per fragment. Intermolecular recombination between loxP sites yields two DNA fragments (5.5 and 1.3 kb) readily distinguishable from the substrate fragments by size. All recombination reactions were in a 12-μl reaction volume containing Cre reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2), 2 nm (100 ng) DNA substrate and 83 nm of Cre. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, terminated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—As a single loxP DNA substrate for EMSA we used a 159-bp PCR fragment of pBS835 5′ 32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA binding reactions were carried out in a 12-μl reaction volume containing Cre reaction buffer, 83 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 8.3 ng/μl calf thymus DNA, 0.05 nm (0.06 ng) of the 32P-labeled DNA substrate and Cre (0-30 nm). Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, 2 μl of loading buffer was added and samples immediately loaded on a pre-run 6% native polyacrylamide gel. Gels were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) scanner. DNA Cleavage Assays—For the intact loxP substrate, oligonucleotide KC335 (TCG AGT GCA CAA CTT CGT ATA ATG TAT GCT ATA CGA AGT TAT CAT TCG CTA G) was 5′ labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, annealed with the complementary oligonucleotide KC336 (CTA GCG AAT GAT AAC TTC GTA TAG CAT ACA TTA TAC GAA GTT GTG CAC TCG A). For the nicked loxP cleavage substrate oligonucleotide KC319 (GTG CAC AAC TTC GTA TAA T) was labeled as above and annealed with both KC322 (GTA TGC TAT ACG AAG TTA TCA TTC GCT AG) and KC336. DNA cleavage reactions were in a 12-μl reaction volume containing Cre reaction buffer, 83 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 8.3 ng/μl calf thymus DNA, 2 nm appropriate 32P-labeled DNA substrate, and 30 nm of Cre. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, terminated by addition of 12 μl of 2× SDS-gel loading buffer (1×: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0% SDS, 7.5% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), heated at 95 °C for 5 min and then analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Gels were quantified using a PhosphorImager scanner. Protein Sequence Alignment—We performed PSI-BLAST searches (22Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schèaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) to identify nearest homologs of Cre recombinase (GenBank™ accession no. 132262). To gain an insight into sequence conservation and variation, we chose a representative set of tyrosine integrase family members composed of the following putative recombinases and integrases: GI:22999436 from Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, GI:13937524 from Pseudomonas sp. ADP, GI:6689029 from Pseudomonas pavonaceae, GI: 21233970 from Streptomyces coelicolor A3 (2Van Duyne G.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

PCC 7120. Sequence alignment was performed using the T-COFFEE program (23Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5514) Google Scholar) with following manual editing using MACAW (24Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Sequence of XerD recombinase GI:16130796 from E. coli was aligned to the resulting multiple alignment profile of other sequences. Automatic Determination of Insert Locations—We wrote a program, IMLANAL (Insertion Mutation Library Analyzer), to precisely locate an insert in a mutated sequence. It requires the following inputs: a reference (wild type) sequence; the sequence of the invariant part of the insertion (TGCGGCCGCA in the case of the Finzymes MGS kit) and the size of the site targeted for transposition (5 bp); and the set of DNA sequence reads from presumed insert clones. The following outputs are produced: a GenBank™-formatted flat (GFF) file containing one additional feature for each detected mutation; a corresponding GFF formatted file (describing only the mutation features) viewable in any GFF compatible sequence viewer (we used Vector NTI from Informax, Inc.); and the record of anomalous situations. IMLANAL is implemented in Perl script, makes use of selected BioPerl modules, and is available at research.stowers-institute.org/mec/software/imlanal or upon request.

Selection of Active and Inactive Cre Mutants—We constructed a library of random pentapeptide insertions into an arabinose-inducible cre gene by in vitro Mu transposition. Transposition and subsequent deletion of the Mu transposon results in an insertion of 15 bp: 10 bp (TGCGGCCGCA) from the transposon, plus 5 bp from duplication of the target DNA sequence at the insertion site. Thus, a gene gains a 5 amino acid insertion into the protein product. We designed the library to have about 75-fold coverage (3 × 105 independent insertions per ∼4000 non-essential bp of plasmid) and then subcloned the 1067-bp HindIII-XbaI fragment carrying the 1029 bp cre gene to ensure that most insertions were in the cre gene. Three sublibraries were selected from the insertion library: (a) cre mutants that retain recombinase activity, (b) highly active cre mutants that retain recombinase activity even with low amounts of protein in vivo (selected without arabinose induction), and (c) inactive cre mutants that have lost recombinase activity at loxP sites. Recombination-proficient Cre mutants excise a loxP-flanked transcription terminator cassette (12Rüfer A.W. Sauer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2764-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) inserted between the neo coding sequence and the lac promoter, thus activating neo and giving a KnR phenotype. By this measure, 39% of our peptapeptide insertion library was recombinationally active. This is the “active cre” sublibrary. Because of the mild selection, some mutants in this sublibrary could have somewhat diminished activity even though they are recombinationally proficient. With increased stringency of selection (no arabinose induction step), wt cre could still efficiently activate the neo gene to give a KnR phenotype (48% of transformants); however, only 6% of insertion mutants were recombinationally proficient. At the third round of enrichment (see “Experimental Procedures”) 43% of transformants from this sublibrary yielded a KnR phenotype. These mutants make up the “highly active cre” sublibrary and are presumed to have virtually undiminished Cre activity. We selected inactive cre mutants using E. coli strain NS2300 (10Sternberg N. Sauer B. Hoess R. Abremski K. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 197-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which carries a loxP-flanked neo gene integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Only library transformants with a recombinationally inactive cre gene, unable to excise neo from the genome, maintain a KnR phenotype. After transformation of NS2300 with the insertion library, 53% of transformed cells stayed kanamycin-resistant, reflecting the percentage of inactive Cre mutants. This is the “inactive cre” sublibrary. These results, taken together with the observed frequency of active cre mutants and assuming random DNA insertion, suggest that slightly greater than one third of the Cre protein can tolerate a pentapeptide insertion without significant loss of recombinase activity. To gauge how well selection worked, we sequenced about 90 mutants from each of the three sublibraries. Because the Cre coding sequence comprises 97% of the targeted HindIII-XbaI restriction fragment, we expected insertions in non-coding regions to occur in both the active cre and highly active cre sublibraries, but not in the inactive cre sublibrary. Moreover, we suspected there would be a higher percentage of insertions into the non-coding regions in the pool obtained from selection under stringent versus more relaxed conditions for retention of function. Sequence analysis confirmed our expectations. Of 92 active cre mutants 4 insertions were in non-coding sequences, of 87 highly active cre mutants 13 were in non-coding sequences, and of 93 inactive cre mutants none were in noncoding sequences. An Insertion-based Functional Map of Cre—Depending on the reading frame of insertion, the 15 bp inserted can be translated into 3 different types of pentapeptides (16Poussu E. Vihinen M. Paulin L. Savilahti H. Proteins. 2004; 54: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To distinguish these one from another we refer to these types of inserts as CGR, RP, and AAA, with the designation representing the invariant amino acids in each reading frame insertion type. Sequencing of a large number of insertion mutants from each of the three sublibraries indicated that there was no strong correlation between the insertion sequence type and the mutant activity (Table I). We therefore focused our attention on the effect of insert location on Cre protein function.Table IDistribution of insertion reading frame types within sublibrariesInsertion reading frame typeSublibraryCGRRPAAATotalHighly active2116946Active23132157Inactive24152968 Open table in a new tab We mapped the locations of inserts from all three sublibraries with respect to the 343 amino acid Cre sequence and relative to Cre secondary structure elements (Fig. 1). Inspection reveals that for all three sublibraries the distribution of insertion mutations is patchy, that is, for each sublibrary there are clusters of insertions in some regions and there are other regions devoid of insertion. The pattern of patchiness is characteristic for each sublibrary. What is also immediately apparent is that there is a clear segregation between locations of inserts in active and inactive mutants. Not only do the inactivating inserts cluster, but there are also no active inserts within those clusters. A similar property holds for the clusters of active inserts. The lone exception is the region spanning β-strand 2 and helix I: most insertions in this region are inactivating, but there is also one position that permits active insertions. In all, there are eight major clusters of active insertions and six clusters of insertions, which abolish Cre activity. The overall density of insertions was high enough to determine functional importance for most regions of Cre, with the exceptions of helices B, E, and J where either no insertion or only one insertion was detected. Insertions that retain Cre activity tend to be outside of secondary structure elements. This was expected, as α-helices and β-strands are responsible for most of the essential structure and contain catalytic amino acid residues. Indeed, many of the inactivating insertions are in defined structural elements. Much less expected was that insertions in several unstructured regions also led to loss of Cre activity. Comparison of the active and highly active cre sublibraries indicates that more stringent selection concentrated insertions primarily to three regions: the N terminus with helix A, the extreme C terminus, and to the loop between the J and K helices. This result indicates that insertions into these three regions probably have little if any negative effect on Cre activity. Purification and assay in vitro of three mutants from the highly active sublibrary, two from the J-K loop and one from the A-helix, support this notion: all three showed approximately the same recombination activity on a loxP substrate as wt Cre (data not shown). Conversely, clusters underrepresented in the highly active sublibrary compared with the active cre sublibrary suggest that insertions into these other regions (D-E loop, 1-2 loop, and I-J region) may slightly reduce Cre activity. Correlation with Secondary and Tertiary Structure—We counted as inserts into secondary structure only those inserts that change the sequence of a secondary structure element. Because the very N-terminal 19 amino acids of Cre are not resolved in the published crystal structures, we considered that region here as unstructured. Fig. 1 shows that there was a general tendency for non-inactivating insertions to be located in loop and linker regions of the protein. However, not every loop or linker was able to harbor non-inactivating insertions. We observed several trends by considering the regions of Cre affected by the 6 clusters of inactivating insertions and the 8 clusters of non-inactivating insertions, along with the presumed function of those regions, their accessibility to solvent and their sequence conservation (discussed in more detail below). In general, non-inactivating insertions preferred loops and linkers accessible to the solvent on the surface of the protein. Conversely, many inactivating insertions occurred in loops between helices or sheets that are quite buried (C-D, G-H, 2-3, K-L, and L-M). In addition, inactivating insertions occurred in the M-N linker. Although buried in the crystallized synaptic structure, this region is very likely solvent-accessible in the Cre monomer. Interestingly, numerous inactivating insertions occurred in several solvent-accessible loops and linkers between secondary structural elements: A-B, E-F, and 3-I. Correlation with Alignment—Functionally important regions of a protein are often highly conserved between closely related members of the same protein family. To compare the Cre insertion distribution with protein amino acid sequences conserved in recombinases closely related to Cre we first built a sequence alignment (Fig. 2) based on 12 close Cre homologs, excluding highly redundant representatives (see “Experimental Procedures”). On the resulting profile we then aligned the XerD recombinase because of those recombinases for which a crystal structure is available it is the most closely related to Cre. The secondary structures of Cre and XerD were then compared with the amino acid alignment. Expectedly, amino acid conservation was strongest in regions of α-helical and β-strand secondary structures. Comparison of the distribution of insertions for each of the Cre insertion libraries (active, highly active, and inactive) to the sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 3. Inspection shows that there is a significant correlation between the effect of pentapeptide insertion and the degree of conservation of the targeted region. The great majority of inactivating insertions fall into conserved regions, such as the highly conserved D helix and the catalytic core composed of the G, H, and K, L, M helices. Inactivating insertions also occur in less conserved regions, such as the loop between the A-B helices, the E-F linker, the 2-3 β-hairpin, and the linker between the M-N helices. Non-inactivating (active and highly active) insertions tend to fall into non-conserved regions. Moreover, many of these regions show highly variable length in the alignment. Such regions include the B-C loop, the loop between the 1-2 β-sheets, the regions between the I-J helices, and between the J-K helices. A notable exception to the tendency of non-inactivating insertions to lie in regions of non-conservation, however, is the cluster of active insertions into the conserved 4-5 β-hairpin region. Characterization in Vitro of Inactive Mutants—Based on their occurrence in exposed loop/linker regions and in nonconserved regions, inactivating insertion mutations occurred in six unexpected places: the A-B loop, the C-D loop, the E-F linker, the β-strand 3-helix I loop, and the M-N linker. We therefore selected the following representative mutants (Fig. 3) for characterization in vitro: 32::CGRIR (A-B loop), 84::VRPQA (C-D loop), 128::CGRTG (E-F linker), 135::CGRTL (E-F linker), 215::GAAAL (β-strand 3-helix I loop), and 333::CGRTG (M-N linker). One of these mutants, 84::VRPQA, failed to bind to the phosphocellulose colu"
