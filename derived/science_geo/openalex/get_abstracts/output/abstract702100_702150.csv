https://openalex.org/W4303614681,"Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 signaling transforms cancer therapy and is assumed to unleash exhausted tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, recent studies have also indicated that the systemic tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells may respond to PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. These discrepancies highlight the importance of further defining tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Here, using multiple preclinical tumor models, we revealed that a subset of tumor-specific CD8+ cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes (TdLNs) was not functionally exhausted but exhibited canonical memory characteristics. TdLN-derived tumor-specific memory (TTSM) cells established memory-associated epigenetic program early during tumorigenesis. More importantly, TdLN-TTSM cells exhibited superior anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy after adoptive transfer and were characterized as bona fide responders to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. These findings highlight that TdLN-TTSM cells could be harnessed to potentiate anti-tumor immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W4302363821,"Long-range gene editing by homology-directed repair (HDR) in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) often relies on viral transduction with recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) for template delivery. Here, we uncover unexpected load and prolonged persistence of AAV genomes and their fragments, which trigger sustained p53-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) upon recruiting the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex on the AAV inverted terminal repeats (ITRs). Accrual of viral DNA in cell-cycle-arrested HSPCs led to its frequent integration, predominantly in the form of transcriptionally competent ITRs, at nuclease on- and off-target sites. Optimized delivery of integrase-defective lentiviral vector (IDLV) induced lower DNA load and less persistent DDR, improving clonogenic capacity and editing efficiency in long-term repopulating HSPCs. Because insertions of viral DNA fragments are less frequent with IDLV, its choice for template delivery mitigates the adverse impact and genotoxic burden of HDR editing and should facilitate its clinical translation in HSPC gene therapy."

However, the common mechanisms governing how reprogramming cells undergo transcriptome and epigenome remodeling (i.e., regulatome remodeling) have not been investigated. Here, by characterizing early changes in the regulatome of three different types of direct reprogramming, we identify lineage-specific features as well as common regulatory transcription factors. Of particular interest, we discover that the neuronal factor Ascl1 possesses cross-lineage potential; together with Mef2c, it drives efficient cardiac reprogramming toward a mature and induced cardiomyocyte phenotype. Through ChIP-seq and RNA-seq, we find that MEF2C drives the shift in ASCL1 binding away from neuronal genes toward cardiac genes, guiding their co-operative epigenetic and transcription activities. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of common regulators of different direct reprogramming and argue against the premise that transcription factors possess only lineage-specific capabilities for altering cell fate – the basic premise used to develop direct reprogramming approaches.

https://openalex.org/W4302362626,"Mucus protects the epithelial cells of the digestive and respiratory tracts from pathogens and other hazards. Progress in determining the molecular mechanisms of mucus barrier function has been limited by the lack of high-resolution structural information on mucins, the giant, secreted, gel-forming glycoproteins that are the major constituents of mucus. Here, we report how mucin structures we determined enabled the discovery of an unanticipated protective role of mucus: managing the toxic transition metal copper. Using two juxtaposed copper binding sites, one for Cu2+ and the other for Cu1+, the intestinal mucin, MUC2, prevents copper toxicity by blocking futile redox cycling and the squandering of dietary antioxidants, while nevertheless permitting uptake of this important trace metal into cells. These findings emphasize the value of molecular structure in advancing mucosal biology, while introducing mucins, produced in massive quantities to guard extensive mucosal surfaces, as extracellular copper chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W4302286504,"The unfoldase ClpC1 is one of the most exciting drug targets against tuberculosis. This AAA+ unfoldase works in cooperation with the ClpP1P2 protease and is the target of at least four natural product antibiotics: cyclomarin, ecumicin, lassomycin, and rufomycin. Although these molecules are promising starting points for drug development, their mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. Taking advantage of a middle domain mutant, we determined the first structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpC1 in its apo, cyclomarin-, and ecumicin-bound states via cryo-EM. The obtained structure displays features observed in other members of the AAA+ family and provides a map for further drug development. While the apo and cyclomarin-bound structures are indistinguishable and have N-terminal domains that are invisible in their respective EM maps, around half of the ecumicin-bound ClpC1 particles display three of their six N-terminal domains in an extended conformation. Our structural observations suggest a mechanism where ecumicin functions by mimicking substrate binding, leading to ATPase activation and changes in protein degradation profile."

https://openalex.org/W4302773551,"Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) uncoupling in skeletal muscle and mitochondrial uncoupling via uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown/beige adipose tissue are two mechanisms implicated in energy expenditure. Here, we investigated the effects of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibition via lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment on SERCA uncoupling in skeletal muscle and UCP1 expression in adipose. C2C12 and 3T3-L1 cells treated with LiCl had increased SERCA uncoupling and UCP1 protein levels, respectively, ultimately raising cellular respiration; however, this was only observed when LiCl treatment occurred throughout differentiation. In vivo, LiCl treatment (10 mg/kg/day) increased food intake in chow-fed diet and high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal)-fed male mice without increasing body mass-a result attributed to elevated daily energy expenditure. In soleus muscle, we determined that LiCl treatment promoted SERCA uncoupling via increased expression of SERCA uncouplers, sarcolipin and/or neuronatin, under chow-fed and HFD-fed conditions. We attribute these effects to the GSK3 inhibition observed with LiCl treatment as partial muscle-specific GSK3 knockdown produced similar effects. In adipose, LiCl treatment inhibited GSK3 in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) but not in brown adipose tissue under chow-fed conditions, which led to an increase in UCP1 in iWAT and a beiging-like effect with a multilocular phenotype. We did not observe this beiging-like effect and increase in UCP1 in mice fed a HFD, as LiCl could not overcome the ensuing overactivation of GSK3. Nonetheless, our study establishes novel regulatory links between GSK3 and SERCA uncoupling in muscle and GSK3 and UCP1 and beiging in iWAT."
https://openalex.org/W4302773679,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease in the US, partly due to the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The roles of bile acids and their receptors, such as the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5, on the development of NASH are not fully clear. C57BL/6J male mice fed a Western diet (WD) develop characteristics of NASH, allowing determination of the effects of FXR and TGR5 agonists on this disease. Here we show that the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 prevents progression of WD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as determined by histological and biochemical assays and novel label-free microscopy imaging techniques, including third harmonic generation, second harmonic generation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Furthermore, we show INT-767 decreases liver fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid and cholesterol uptake, as well as liver inflammation. INT-767 markedly changed bile acid composition in the liver and intestine, leading to notable decreases in the hydrophobicity index of bile acids, known to limit cholesterol and lipid absorption. In addition, INT-767 upregulated expression of liver p-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1α, and SIRT3, which are master regulators of mitochondrial function. Finally, we found INT-767 treatment reduced WD-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Interestingly, the effects of INT-767 in attenuating NASH were absent in FXR-null mice, but still present in TGR5-null mice. Our findings support treatment and prevention protocols with the dual FXR-TGR5 agonist INT-767 arrest progression of WD-induced NASH in mice mediated by FXR-dependent, TGR5-independent mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W4303449317,"Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) as an advanced endoscopic procedure can be considered for the removal of colorectal lesions with high suspicion of limited submucosal invasion or cannot be optimally removed by snare-based techniques. We aimed to analyze the clinical outcomes of ESD for colorectal neoplasms in our hospital.We retrospectively enrolled 230 patients with 244 colorectal neoplasms who received ESD procedures from April 2012 to October 2020 at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Clinicopathological data were collected by chart review. We also recorded ESD-related complications and clinical outcomes.The average age was 64 years old, with a mean follow-up time of 22.59 months. There was a loss of follow-up in 34 lesions. Most lesions were lateral spreading tumors of the non-granular type. The average ESD time was 51.9 minutes. Nine cases (3.7%) had procedure-related complications, including two intra-procedure perforations (0.8%) and seven delayed bleeding (2.9%) without procedure-related mortality. 241 lesions (98.8%) achieved en-bloc resection, while 207 lesions (84.8%) achieved R0 resection. Most lesions were tubulo-(villous) adenoma. Malignancy included 35 adenocarcinomas and 5 neuroendocrine tumors. No local recurrence was developed during follow-up. Multivariate analysis for long ESD time revealed significance in size ≥ 10 cm2 and endoscopist's experience < 3 years. Pre-ESD endoscopic ultrasound revealed good prediction in discrimination of mucosal (sensitivity: 0.90) and submucosal lesion (specificity: 0.67).ESD for colorectal neoplasms is an effective and safe technique. Size ≥ 10 cm2 and endoscopist's experience < 3 years were significantly associated with long procedure time. Pre-ESD EUS provided a good prediction for colorectal neoplasms in invasion depth."
https://openalex.org/W4303648305,"Many circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in the osteogenesis of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) have recently been discovered. The role of circHIPK3 in osteogenesis has yet to be determined. Cell transfection was conducted using small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Expression of osteogenic markers were detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting analysis, and immunofluorescence staining. Ectopic bone formation models in nude mice were used to examined the bone formation ability in vivo. The autophagy flux was examined via western blotting analysis, immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy analysis. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) analysis was carried out to analyze the binding between human antigen R (HUR) and circHIPK3 or autophagy-related 16-like 1 (ATG16L1). Actinomycin D was used to determine the mRNA stability. Our results demonstrated that silencing circHIPK3 promoted the osteogenesis of hBMSCs while silencing the linear mHIPK3 did not affect osteogenic differentiation, both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, we found that knockdown of circHIPK3 activated autophagy flux. Activation of autophagy enhanced the osteogenesis of hBMSCs and inhibition of autophagy reduced the osteogenesis through using autophagy regulators chloroquine and rapamycin. We also discovered that circHIPK3 and ATG16L1 both bound to HUR. Knockdown of circHIPK3 released the binding sites of HUR to ATG16L1, which stabilized the mRNA expression of ATG16L1, resulting in the upregulation of ATG16L1 and autophagy activation. CircHIPK3 functions as an osteogenesis and autophagy regulator and has the potential for clinical application in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4301401608,"The small GTPase CDC42 plays essential roles in neurogenesis and brain development. Previously, we showed that a CDC42 splice variant that has a ubiquitous tissue distribution specifically stimulates the formation of neural progenitor cells, whereas a brain-specific CDC42 variant, CDC42b, is essential for promoting the transition of neural progenitor cells to neurons. These specific roles of CDC42 and CDC42b in neurogenesis are ascribed to their opposing effects on mTORC1 activity. Specifically, the ubiquitous form of CDC42 stimulates mTORC1 activity and thereby upregulates tissue-specific transcription factors that are essential for neuroprogenitor formation, whereas CDC42b works together with activated CDC42-associated kinase (ACK) to downregulate mTOR expression. Here, we demonstrate that the EGF receptor (EGFR) is an additional and important target of CDC42b and ACK, which is downregulated by their combined actions in promoting neurogenesis. The activation status of the EGFR determines the timing by which neural progenitor cells derived from P19 embryonal carcinoma terminally differentiate into neurons. By promoting EGFR degradation, we found that CDC42b and ACK stimulate autophagy, which protects emerging neurons from apoptosis and helps trigger neural progenitor cells to differentiate into neurons. Moreover, our results reveal that CDC42b is localized in phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate-enriched microdomains on the plasma membrane, mediated through its polybasic sequence 185KRK187, which is essential for determining its distinct functions. Overall, these findings now highlight a molecular mechanism by which CDC42b and ACK regulate neuronal differentiation and provide new insights into the functional interplay between EGFR degradation and autophagy that occurs during embryonic neurogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4302363808,"Population-based studies to identify disease-associated risk alleles typically require samples from a large number of individuals. Here, we report a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-based screening strategy to link human genetics with viral infectivity. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a cluster of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a cis-regulatory region of the NDUFA4 gene, which was associated with susceptibility to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Loss of NDUFA4 led to decreased sensitivity to ZIKV, dengue virus, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Isogenic hiPSC lines carrying non-risk alleles of SNPs or deletion of the cis-regulatory region lower sensitivity to viral infection. Mechanistic studies indicated that loss/reduction of NDUFA4 causes mitochondrial stress, which leads to the leakage of mtDNA and thereby upregulation of type I interferon signaling. This study provides proof-of-principle for the application of iPSC arrays in GWAS and identifies NDUFA4 as a previously unknown susceptibility locus for viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W4302773520,"PpiD and YfgM are inner membrane proteins that are both composed of an N-terminal transmembrane segment and a C-terminal periplasmic domain. Escherichia coli YfgM and PpiD form a stable complex that interacts with the SecY/E/G (Sec) translocon, a channel that allows protein translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane. Although PpiD is known to function in protein translocation, the functional significance of PpiD-YfgM complex formation as well as the molecular mechanisms of PpiD-YfgM and PpiD/YfgM-Sec translocon interactions remain unclear. Here, we conducted genetic and biochemical studies using yfgM and ppiD mutants and demonstrated that a lack of YfgM caused partial PpiD degradation at its C-terminal region and hindered the membrane translocation of Vibrio protein export monitoring polypeptide (VemP), a Vibrio secretory protein, in both E. coli and Vibrio alginolyticus. While ppiD disruption also impaired VemP translocation, we found that the yfgM and ppiD double deletion exhibited no additive or synergistic effects. Together, these results strongly suggest that both PpiD and YfgM are required for efficient VemP translocation. Furthermore, our site-directed in vivo photocrosslinking analysis revealed that the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of YfgM and a conserved structural domain (NC domain) in PpiD interact with each other and that YfgM, like PpiD, directly interacts with the SecG translocon subunit. Crosslinking analysis also suggested that PpiD-YfgM complex formation is required for these proteins to interact with SecG. In summary, we propose that PpiD and YfgM form a functional unit that stimulates protein translocation by facilitating their proper interactions with the Sec translocon."
https://openalex.org/W4302773635,"Insect gustatory receptors play roles in sensing tastants, such as sugars and bitter substances. We previously demonstrated that the BmGr9 silkworm gustatory receptor is a d-fructose–gated ion channel receptor. However, the molecular mechanism of how d-fructose could initiate channel opening were unclear. Herein, we present a structural model for a channel pore and a d-fructose–binding site in BmGr9. Since the membrane topology and oligomeric state of BmGr9 appeared to be similar to those of an insect odorant receptor coreceptor, Orco, we constructed a structural model of BmGr9 based on the cryo-EM Orco structure. Our site-directed mutagenesis data suggested that the transmembrane region 7 forms channel pore and controls channel gating. This model also suggested that a pocket formed by transmembrane helices 2 to 4 and 6 binds d-fructose. Using mutagenesis experiments in combination with docking simulations, we were able to determine the potent binding mode of d-fructose. Finally, based on these data, we propose a conformational change that leads to channel opening upon d-fructose binding. Taken together, these findings detail the molecular mechanism by which an insect gustatory receptor can be activated by its ligand molecule."

However, HIV-related stigma experiences and coping strategies have received little attention, especially among pregnant women in rural settings. We explored the HIV-related stigma experiences and coping strategies among pregnant women in rural northern Uganda.This was a qualitative descriptive study conducted among HIV-positive pregnant women seeking care at Aboke Health Center IV, Kole district, northern Uganda. We conducted 12 in-depth interviews using a semi-structured interview guide. Data were analyzed using the inductive thematic approach of Braun and Clarke.The age range of the 12 participants was 17 to 35 years while the average duration with HIV since diagnosis was five years. The majority of the participants were subsistence farmers who had attained a primary level of education. Social rejection and public ridicule were identified as HIV-related stigma experiences while ignoring, social support, and prayers were identified as HIV-related coping strategies among the study participants.Enacted HIV-related stigma is common among pregnant women in rural northern Uganda. Healthcare providers should work closely with HIV-positive women and other stakeholders to identify and strengthen HIV-related stigma coping strategies among pregnant women in rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W4303644476,"The bone marrow microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM) is hypoxic and provides multi-advantages for the initiation of chemoresistance, but the underlying mechanisms and key regulators are still indistinct. In the current study, we found that hypoxia stimulus easily induced chemoresistance to proteasome inhibitors (PIs), and the steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) expression was remarkably augmented at posttranslational level. Protein interactome analysis identified SENP1 as a key modifier of SRC-3 stability, as SENP1-mediated deSUMOylation attenuated the K11-linked polyubiquitination of SRC-3. SENP1 depletion in the SENP1fl/flCD19Cre/+ B cells showed impaired SRC3 stability, and knockdown of SENP1 in MM cells by CRISPR/cas9 sgRNA accelerated the degradation of SRC-3 and remarkably overcame the resistance to PIs. In the Vk*Myc and 5TGM1 mouse models as well as patient-derived xenograft (PDX) of myeloma, SENP1 inhibitor Momordin Ιc (Mc) increased the sensitivity to PIs in MM cells. Importantly, SENP1 level was positively correlated with SRC-3 level in the tissues from refractory/relapsed MM, as well as in xenograft tissues from mice treated with bortezomib and Mc. Taken together, our findings suggest that hypoxia-induced SENP1 is a crucial regulator of chemoresistance to PIs, and shed light on developing therapeutic strategies to overcome chemoresistance by using small molecules targeting SENP1 or SRC-3."
https://openalex.org/W4303648242,"Cox17 is required in the assembly of mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS) and Cu metallization of cytochrome C oxidase (CcO) in mitochondria as well as Cu homeostasis in cells. Cox deficiency is associated with hematopoietic diseases such as tubulopathy and leukodystrophy, but whether and how cox17 functions in hematopoiesis are still unknown. Here, we report the effects of zebrafish cox17 deficiency on primitive erythropoiesis, mitochondrial metabolism, and hypoxia tolerance. Cox17-/- larvae were sensitive to hypoxia stress, with reduced primitive erythropoiesis. Meanwhile, cox17-/- mutants showed a significant reduction in the expression of pivotal transcriptional regulators in erythropoiesis, such as scl, lmo2, and gata1a at 14 h post fertilization (hpf), with expression remaining downregulated for scl but upregulated for lmo2 and gata1a at 24 hpf. Mechanistically, cox17-/- mutants showed impaired mitochondrial metabolism, coupled with a significant decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP and SAM content, and the ratio of SAM and SAH. Additionally, disrupting mitochondrial metabolism in wild type (WT) larvae treated with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) could mimic the primitive erythropoiesis defects observed in cox17-/- mutants. Moreover, cox17-/- mutants exhibited significantly downregulated WNT signaling and upregulated ER stress, with a significant reduction of beta-Catenin in gata1a+ cells and of binding enrichment in both scl and lmo2 promoters of the WNT transcriptional factor TCF4. This is the first report on the novel linkage of cox17 deficiency with defective primitive erythropoiesis and reduced hypoxia tolerance. This study has shed light on the potential mechanism by which Cox deficiency, especially cox17 deficiency, induces Cu homeostasis imbalance, leading to hematopoietic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4304092562,"The fast-growing quantity of information hinders the process of machine learning, making it computationally costly and with substandard results. Feature selection is a pre-processing method for obtaining the optimal subset of features in a data set. Optimization algorithms struggle to decrease the dimensionality while retaining accuracy in high-dimensional data set. This article proposes a novel chaotic opposition fruit fly optimization algorithm, an improved variation of the original fruit fly algorithm, advanced and adapted for binary optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is tested on ten unconstrained benchmark functions and evaluated on twenty-one standard datasets taken from the Univesity of California, Irvine repository and Arizona State University. Further, the presented algorithm is assessed on a coronavirus disease dataset, as well. The proposed method is then compared with several well-known feature selection algorithms on the same datasets. The results prove that the presented algorithm predominantly outperform other algorithms in selecting the most relevant features by decreasing the number of utilized features and improving classification accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4302362962,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is present in multiple copies and phenotypic consequences of mtDNA mutations depend on the mutant load surpassing a specific threshold. Additionally, changes in mtDNA copy number can impact mitochondrial ATP production, resulting in disease. Therefore, the precise determination of mtDNA heteroplasmy and copy number is crucial to the study of mitochondrial diseases. However, current methods can be imprecise, and quantifying small changes in either heteroplasmy or copy number is challenging. We developed a new approach to measure mtDNA heteroplasmy using a single digital PCR (dPCR) probe. This method is based on the observation that fluorescent-labeled probes in dPCR exhibit different intensities depending on the presence of a single nucleotide change in the sequence bound by the probe. This finding allowed us to precisely and simultaneously determine mtDNA copy number and heteroplasmy levels using duplex dPCR. We tested this approach in two different models (human and mouse), which proved faster and more internally controlled when compared to other published methods routinely used in the mitochondrial genetics field. We believe this approach could be broadly applicable to the detection and quantification of other mixed genetic variations."

https://openalex.org/W4302773750,"The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas system provides prokaryotes with protection against mobile genetic elements such as phages. In turn, phages deploy anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to evade this immunity. AcrIF4, an Acr targeting the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system, has been reported to bind the crRNA-guided surveillance (Csy) complex. However, it remains controversial whether AcrIF4 inhibits target DNA binding to the Csy complex. Here, we present structural and mechanistic studies into AcrIF4, exploring its unique anti-CRISPR mechanism. While the Csy-AcrIF4 complex displays decreased affinity for target DNA, it is still able to bind the DNA. Our structural and functional analyses of the Csy-AcrIF4-dsDNA complex revealed that AcrIF4 binding prevents rotation of the helical bundle of the Cas8f subunit induced by dsDNA binding, therefore resulting in failure of nuclease Cas2/3 recruitment and DNA cleavage. Overall, our study provides an interesting example of attack on the nuclease recruitment event by an Acr, but not conventional mechanisms of blocking binding of target DNA."
https://openalex.org/W4303449316,"Postoperative recovery of urinary continence has a great impact on quality of life for patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). A variety of surgical techniques including reconstruction of the periurethral structure have been introduced, and yet there are no effective methods that promote early urinary continence recovery after surgery. We hypothesized that the preservation of pelvic floor muscle structure could be responsible for early recovery of urinary continence after surgery.A total of 94 consecutive patients who underwent RARP at our hospital were enrolled in this study. Operative video records were reviewed and the severity of pelvic floor muscle injury was classified according to the scoring system that we devised in this study. Briefly, damage of pelvic floor muscles was classified into 4 categories; intact, fascial injury, unilateral muscle injury, and bilateral muscle injury. The volume of urinary incontinence was measured for 2 days after removal of the urethral catheter, and the incontinence ratio (amount of incontinence/total volume of urine per day) was calculated. Predictive factors for immediate incontinence after catheter removal were identified by multivariate regression analysis.The severity of puboperineal muscle injury was significantly associated with the early incontinence ratio after catheter removal (p < 0.001). Age at surgery and severity of puboperineal muscle injury were independent predictors for early incontinence after catheter removal.Preservation of the pelvic floor muscle, particularly the puboperineal muscle is an important factor for early continence recovery after RARP."
https://openalex.org/W4303449335,"The current study intended to trigger the immune response to cancer cells by using antibodies conjugated with bacterial antigens. The protein membrane of the MCF7 cell line was extracted and specific antibodies against cell membrane antigens was produced in rabbits. The specific antibodies were purified using chromatography methods and linked to E. coli antigens or doxorubicin using Diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) linker. After confirmation of the conjugation process using SDS-PAGE and ATR-FTIR methods, the MCF7 and HUVEC cells were treated with various concentrations of the prepared conjugated antibodies along with human serum. The toxicity of each treatment against MCF7 and HUVEC cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. Also, polylactic acid scaffolds that contain 10×104 MCF7 cells were surgically placed in the peritoneal cavity of the rats. After treatment of each group, induction of the inflammatory responses was evaluated on stained histological sections of the scaffolds. The lowest cytotoxic doses of the antigen conjugated-antibody, doxorubicin-conjugated-antibody was 4 and 1 μg/mL, respectively. Doxorubicin conjugated antibodies displayed greater toxicity on both MCF7 and HUVEC cells. The in vivo finding revealed that the inflammatory cells were significantly higher in treating animals with antigen conjugated-antibody. The current synthetic agent stimulated the serum toxicity and induced an inflammatory response to MCF7 cell lines. Targeting of the bacterial antigens on tumor sites by immune system elements, could limit the growth of the tumor cells."

The early prediction is crucial for preventive strategies design and integrative medical practice. However, knowledge about how to predict multimorbidity is limited, possibly due to the complexity involved in predicting multiple chronic diseases.In this study, we present the use of a machine learning approach to build cost-effective multimorbidity prediction models. Based on predictors easily obtainable in clinical practice (sociodemographic, clinical, family disease history and lifestyle), we build and compared the performance of seven multilabel classifiers (multivariate random forest, and classifier chain, binary relevance and binary dependence, with random forest and support vector machine as base classifiers), using a sample of 15105 participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil). We developed a web application for the building and use of prediction models.Classifier chain with random forest as base classifier performed better (accuracy = 0.34, subset accuracy = 0.15, and Hamming Loss = 0.16). For different feature sets, random forest based classifiers outperformed those based on support vector machine. BMI, blood pressure, sex, and age were the features most relevant to multimorbidity prediction.Our results support the choice of random forest based classifiers for multimorbidity prediction."

This is happening across all of higher education and it is happening more specifically within STEM fields. The growth of online learning has significantly accelerated the past couple of years during the COVID-19 pandemic as colleges and universities have sought ways to continue educating students while also keeping students, faculty and staff safe. As result, many college faculty and instructors across all fields of study including STEM fields have made and continue to make the transition to teaching online for the first time. Teaching in an online environment is different from traditional classroom teaching in many ways and presents a unique set of challenges to college instructors. This study documents the development of an instrument used for instructors to self-report their instructional techniques and practices. Data from 251 instructors is also used to examine how this instrument can be used to better understand particular practices, with a focus in this study on discussion facilitation. The results align with the Community of Inquiry framework, including indicating that teaching through discussion forums involves direct contribution and/or facilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4304092538,"Mathematical models can be very useful in determining efficient and successful antibiotic dosing regimens. In this study, we consider the problem of determining optimal antibiotic dosing when bacteria resistant to antibiotics are present in addition to susceptible bacteria. We consider two different models of resistance acquisition, both involve the horizontal transfer (HGT) of resistant genes from a resistant to a susceptible strain. Modeling studies on HGT and study of optimal antibiotic dosing protocols in the literature, have been mostly focused on transfer of resistant genes via conjugation, with few studies on HGT via transformation. We propose a deterministic ODE based model of resistance acquisition via transformation, followed by a model that takes into account resistance acquisition through conjugation. Using a numerical optimization algorithm to determine the 'best' antibiotic dosing strategy. To illustrate our optimization method, we first consider optimal dosing when all the bacteria are susceptible to the antibiotic. We then consider the case where resistant strains are present. We note that constant periodic dosing may not always succeed in eradicating the bacteria while an optimal dosing protocol is successful. We determine the optimal dosing strategy in two different scenarios: one where the total bacterial population is to be minimized, and the next where we want to minimize the bacterial population at the end of the dosing period. We observe that the optimal strategy in the first case involves high initial dosing with dose tapering as time goes on, while in the second case, the optimal dosing strategy is to increase the dosing at the beginning of the dose cycles followed by a possible dose tapering. As a follow up study we intend to look at models where 'persistent' bacteria may be present in additional to resistant and susceptible strain and determine the optimal dosing protocols in this case."
https://openalex.org/W4302362976,"The nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is an important regulator of intestinal and metabolic function. Previous studies suggest that pentacyclic triterpenes (PCTs), a class of plant-derived bioactive phytochemical, can modulate FXR activity and may therefore offer therapeutic benefits. Here, we investigated the effects of a prototypical PCT, hederagenin (HG), on FXR expression, activity, and antisecretory actions in colonic epithelial cells. T84 cells and murine enteroid-derived monolayers were employed to assess HG effects on FXR expression and activity in colonic epithelia. We measured mRNA levels by qRT-PCR and protein by ELISA and immunoblotting. Transepithelial Cl- secretion was assessed as changes in short circuit current in Ussing chambers. We determined HG treatment (5-10 μM) alone did not induce FXR activation but significantly increased expression of the receptor, both in T84 cells and murine enteroid-derived monolayers. This effect was accompanied by enhanced FXR activity, as assessed by FGF-15/19 induction in response to the synthetic, GW4064, or natural FXR agonist, chenodeoxycholic acid. Effects of HG on FXR expression and activity were mimicked by another PCT, oleanolic acid. Furthermore, we found FXR-induced downregulation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl- channels and inhibition of transepithelial Cl- secretion were enhanced in HG-treated cells. These data demonstrate that dietary PCTs have the capacity to modulate FXR expression, activity, and antisecretory actions in colonic epithelial cells. Based on these data, we propose that plants rich in PCTs, or extracts thereof, have excellent potential for development as a new class of ""FXR-targeted nutraceuticals""."
https://openalex.org/W4302773532,"The REGγ-20S proteasome is an ubiquitin- and ATP-independent degradation system, targeting selective substrates, possibly helping to regulate aging. The studies we report here demonstrate that aging-associated REGγ decline predisposes to decreasing tau turnover, as in a tauopathy. The REGγ proteasome promotes degradation of human and mouse tau, notably phosphorylated tau and toxic tau oligomers that shuttle between the cytoplasm and nuclei. REGγ-mediated proteasomal degradation of tau was validated in 3- to 12-month-old REGγ KO mice, REGγ KO;PS19 mice, and PS19 mice with forebrain conditional neuron-specific overexpression of REGγ (REGγ OE) and behavioral abnormalities. Coupled with tau accumulation, we found with REGγ-deficiency, neuron loss, dendrite reduction, tau filament accumulation, and microglial activation are much more prominent in the REGγ KO;PS19 than the PS19 model. Moreover, we observed that the degenerative neuronal lesions and aberrant behaviors were alleviated in REGγ OE;PS19 mice. Memory and other behavior analysis substantiate the role of REGγ in prevention of tauopathy-like symptoms. In addition, we investigated the potential mechanism underlying aging-related REGγ decline. This study provides valuable insights into the novel regulatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets for tau-related neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4302773660,"RNA-binding proteins of the DBHS (Drosophila Behavior Human Splicing) family, NONO, SFPQ, and PSPC1 have numerous roles in genome stability and transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Critical to DBHS activity is their recruitment to distinct subnuclear locations, for example, paraspeckle condensates, where DBHS proteins bind to the long noncoding RNA NEAT1 in the first essential step in paraspeckle formation. To carry out their diverse roles, DBHS proteins form homodimers and heterodimers, but how this dimerization influences DBHS localization and function is unknown. Here, we present an inducible GFP-NONO stable cell line and use it for live-cell 3D-structured illumination microscopy, revealing paraspeckles with dynamic, twisted elongated structures. Using siRNA knockdowns, we show these labeled paraspeckles consist of GFP-NONO/endogenous SFPQ dimers and that GFP-NONO localization to paraspeckles depends on endogenous SFPQ. Using purified proteins, we confirm that partner swapping between NONO and SFPQ occurs readily in vitro. Crystallographic analysis of the NONO-SFPQ heterodimer reveals conformational differences to the other DBHS dimer structures, which may contribute to partner preference, RNA specificity, and subnuclear localization. Thus overall, our study suggests heterodimer partner availability is crucial for NONO subnuclear distribution and helps explain the complexity of both DBHS protein and paraspeckle dynamics through imaging and structural approaches."
https://openalex.org/W4302773757,"Dengue virus (DENV) is a flavivirus causing an estimated 390 million infections per year around the world. Despite the immense global health and economic impact of this virus, its true receptor(s) for internalization into live cells has not yet been identified, and no successful antivirals or treatments have been isolated to this date. This study aims to improve our understanding of virus entry routes by exploring the sialic acid-based cell surface molecule GM1a and its role in DENV infection. We studied the interaction of the virus with GM1a using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence crosscorrelation spectroscopy, imaging fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, amide hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and isothermal titration calorimetry. Additionally, we explored the effect of this interaction on infectivity and movement of the virus during infection was explored using plaque assay and fluorescence-based imaging and single particle tracking. GM1a was deemed to interact with DENV at domain I (DI) and domain II (DII) of the E protein of the protein coat at quaternary contacts of a fully assembled virus, leading to a 10-fold and 7-fold increase in infectivity for DENV1 and DENV2 in mammalian cell systems, respectively. We determined that the interaction of the virus with GM1a triggers a speeding up of virus movement on live cell surfaces, possibly resulting from a reduction in rigidity of cellular rafts during infection. Collectively, our results suggest that GM1a functions as a coreceptor/attachment factor for DENV during infection in mammalian systems."

https://openalex.org/W4303449119,"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has experienced high levels of unmet need for family planning (UNFP) for many years, alongside high fertility, maternal and infant mortality rates. Previous research addressed the UNFP in DRC, but analyses were limited to the individual-level and to specific regions. This study aims to determine the individual- and community-level factors associated with UNFP among married women of reproductive age in DRC. Using data from the 2014 DRC Demographic and Health Survey, a two-level mixed-effect logistic model examined i) the associations between UNFP and individual- and community level factors, and ii) the extent to which individual variability in UNFP is due to the variability observed at the community-level, given the individual characteristics. A total of 10,415 women in 539 clusters were included. Prevalence of unmet need for limiting was 8.13%, and 23.81% for spacing. Compared to adolescents (15-24), young (25-34) (aOR = 0.75, CI: 0.63-0.90) and middle-aged (35-49) (aOR = 0.65, CI: 0.51-0.82) women were less likely to have unmet need for family planning. The odds of having unmet need increased significantly with number of living children [1-2 children (aOR = 2.46, CI: 1.81-3.35), 7+ children (aOR = 6.46, CI: 4.28-9.73)] and among women in a female-headed household (aOR = 1.22, CI: 1.04-1.42). Women from provinces Equateur (aOR = 1.82, CI: 1.24-2.68), Nord-Kivu (aOR = 1.66, CI: 1.10-2.55) and Orientale (aOR = 1.60, CI: 1.10-2.32) were more likely to have unmet need, compared to women from Kinshasa. Women from communities with medium (aOR = 1.32, CI: 1.01-1.72) and high (aOR = 1.46, CI: 0.98-2.18) proportion of women in wealthy households, and medium (aOR = 1.32, CI: 1.01-1.72) and high (aOR = 1.46, CI: 0.98-2.18) proportion of women with low ideal family size (≤6) were more likely to have unmet need, compared to those from communities with low proportion of wealthy households and high ideal family size, respectively. Policies should consider strengthening family planning programs in provinces Equateur, Orientale, and Nord-Kivu, and in wealthier communities and communities with a higher ideal family size. Family planning programs should target adolescents and young women."
https://openalex.org/W4303449353,"Persons with disability (PWD) experience disproportionately high poverty rates in Canada. This trend is apparent especially among youth compared to those who develop disabilities later in life. PWD in poverty have additional needs that increase barriers to full participation in society and translate to higher basic costs for daily living. Despite the existence of income assistance programs in Canada to mitigate income inequalities faced by PWDs, access to these programs can be limited.To describe use of income assistance for young adults with disability in British Columbia for the development of potential approaches to improve realized access to these programs.We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study using British Columbia linked administrative data. We described differences in income assistance use among PWD by the level of special education funding received during primary school education (from most to least; Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, Unfunded, and no special education) and family composition. We also provided longitudinal patterns of income assistance use.Of 218,324 young adults, 88% received no special education, 0.1% used Level One, 1.6% used Level Two, 2.9% used Level Three, and 7.1% used Unfunded special education coding. Young adults with Level One special education funding had the highest rates of hospitalizations and continuing care, with no hospitalization due to homelessness. Those with Level Three special education coding had higher rates of hospitalization and hospitalization due to homelessness than Level Two young adults. When transitioning to adulthood initially, Level One and Two funded individuals used relatively more disability income assistance than individuals from the other funding levels. Nearly all BCEA users with higher funded special education codes used this disability-specific program, while lesser funded special education codes used the Temporary Assistance more frequently, for a longer duration and were more likely to be persistent Temporary Assistance users.Sustainable and reliable access to income assistance programs remains an issue across the heterogeneity of needs faced by young adults with disability."
https://openalex.org/W4303511508,"Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is associated with the prognosis of many diseases, but the relationship between LDH and the poor prognosis (recurrence and death) of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has not been fully clarified. This study aimed to investigate the association between admission LDH level and poor prognosis in patients with AIS.This retrospective study enrolled AIS patients treated in Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province from July 2019 to December 2019. Poor prognosis included AIS recurrence and all-cause death at 3, 6, and 18 months. The correction between LDH and poor prognosis or all-cause death was assessed. Lasso Cox expression and multivariate Cox expression analyses were used to evaluate the association of LDH with the risk of poor prognosis and all-cause death, respectively. A nomogram was constructed to evaluate the predictive Values of LDH for the poor prognosis and all-cause death of AIS.732 patients were included in the study. Multivariate analysis shows that admission LDH levels were significantly correlated with poor prognosis [odds ratio (OR),1.003; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.001-1.005; P = 0.001] and all-cause death (OR, 1.005; 95% CI, 1.000-1.009; P = 0.031). The correlation analysis showed that admission LDH level was positively correlated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (td-ROC) curves analysis showed that the AUC values of admission LDH level for predicting prognosis of AIS patients in 3-month, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month were 0.706 (95% CI, 0.604-0.810), 0.653 (95% CI, 0.583-0.723), 0.616 (95% CI, 0.556-60676) and 0.610 (95% CI, 0.552-0.680), respectively. And td-ROC also showed that the AUC values of admission LDH level for predicting all-cause death of AIS patients in 3-month, 6-month,12-month and 18-month were 0.861 (95% CI, 0.764-0.958), 0.824 (95% CI, 0.753-0.890), 0.726 (95% CI, 0.633-0.819) and 0.715 (95% CI, 0.622-0.807), respectively. The nomograms were constructed to create the predictive models of the poor prognosis and all-cause death of AIS.Higher LDH levels are independently associated with poor prognosis and all-cause death of AIS."
https://openalex.org/W4303511509,"To better understand the effect of the size of hole defects on the mechanical properties of a rock mass, the two-dimensional particle flow discrete element code (PFC2D) is applied to establish rock mass models with single circular hole defects of different diameters. Uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) tests are conducted on each model by only taking the defect size (area) as a variable. This study analyzes each model's stress-strain, contact force chain, crack evolution, meso-damage and failure, and mechanical properties. The results showed that with the size enlargement of the circular hole defects, each model's UCS and elastic modulus gradually decrease, and the defect size is negatively correlated with the mechanical strength of the rock samples. The size of the hole defects affects the entire process of contact force chain and crack evolution. The larger the aperture dimension of the circular hole defects in each model, the greater the concentration degree of the contact force chain, the earlier the crack initiation, and the higher the degree of crack coalescence in the post-peak stage. The number of cracks decreases as the hole size increases, and the model is more prone to failure. Rock models' strength and failure characteristics with different numbers and arrangements of hole defects are discussed under the same defect area condition."
https://openalex.org/W4303648551,"Abstract Loss of respiratory functions impairs Candida albicans colonization of host tissues and virulence in a murine model of candidiasis. Furthermore, it is known that respiratory inhibitors decrease mannan synthesis and glucan exposure and thereby promotes phagocytosis. To understand the impact of respiratory proteins of C. albicans on host innate immunity, we characterized cell wall defects in three mitochondrial complex I (CI) null mutants ( nuo1Δ, nuo2Δ and ndh51Δ ) and in one CI regulator mutant ( goa1 Δ), and we studied the corresponding effects of these mutants on phagocytosis, neutrophil killing and cytokine production by dendritic cells (DCs). We find that reductions of phosphopeptidomannan (PPM) in goa1Δ, nuo1Δ and phospholipomannan (PLM) in nuo2Δ lead to reductions of IL‐2, IL‐4, and IL‐10 but increase of TNF‐α in infected DCs. While PPM loss is a consequence of a reduced phospho‐Cek1/2 MAPK that failed to promote phagocytosis and IL‐22 production in goa1Δ and nuo1Δ , a 30% glucan reduction and a defective Mek1 MAPK response in ndh51Δ lead to only minor changes in phagocytosis and cytokine production. Glucan exposure and PLM abundance seem to remain sufficient to opsonize neutrophil killing perhaps via humoral immunity. The diversity of immune phenotypes in these mutants possessing divergent cell wall defects is further supported by their transcriptional profiles in each infected murine macrophage scenario . Since metabolic processes, oxidative stress‐induced senescence, and apoptosis are differently affected in these scenarios, we speculate that during the early stages of infection, host immune cells coordinate their bioactivities based upon a mixture of signals generated during host‐fungi interactions."

Natively, however, αS is predominantly found within presynaptic nerve terminals, where it abundantly colocalizes with lipids (22Stefanis L. α-Synuclein in Parkinson’s disease.Cold Spring Harb.

Although the native function of αS is not completely understood, it is thought to be involved with synaptic vesicle transport and fusion with the presynaptic membranes within dopaminergic neurons (23Burré J.

When bound to lipid membranes, αS readily reconfigures from a natively unfolded (random coil) conformer to a structure rich in α-helical content (26Meade R.M. Fairlie D.P. Mason J.M.

However, when located within Lewy bodies, αS is mainly found to have been converted into highly ordered β-sheet–rich amyloid aggregates (19Spillantini M.G. Crowther R.A. Jakes R. Hasegawa M. Goedert M. α-Synuclein in filamentous inclusions of Lewy bodies from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These important structural distinctions, combined with the profound changes implemented by single amino acid substitutions associated with early onset PD, warrant further investigation into their effect upon aggregation in the presence of lipid vesicles.

https://openalex.org/W4303449146,"Asthma, an inflammatory disorder of the airways, is one of the most common chronic illnesses worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity. There is growing recognition of an association between asthma and mood disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). Although there are several hypotheses regarding the relationship between asthma and mental health, there is little understanding of underlying mechanisms and causality. In the current study we utilized publicly available datasets of human blood mRNA collected from patients with severe and moderate asthma, MDD, and PTSD. We performed differential expression (DE) analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on diseased subjects against the healthy subjects from their respective datasets, compared the results between diseases, and validated DE genes and gene sets with 4 more independent datasets. Our analysis revealed that commonalities in blood transcriptomic changes were only found between the severe form of asthma and mood disorders. Gene expression commonly regulated in PTSD and severe asthma, included ORMDL3 a gene known to be associated with asthma risk and STX8, which is involved in TrkA signaling. We also identified several pathways commonly regulated to both MDD and severe asthma. This study reveals gene and pathway regulation that potentially drives the comorbidity between severe asthma, PTSD, and MDD and may serve as foci for future research aimed at gaining a better understanding of both the relationship between asthma and PTSD, and the pathophysiology of the individual disorders."
https://openalex.org/W4303449151,"Dramatic improvements in cancer survival have occurred in the last decade, but the quality of life for many survivors is compromised due to severe, long-lasting, and often irreversible side effects of chemotherapy. The neurological side effects, chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) and cancer related/induced cognitive impairment (CRCI/CICI), are under-recognized and can occur after chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiation. The cellular mechanisms underlying these neurological side effects are poorly understood and there are no effective treatments or preventions, other than reduction or termination of cancer therapy. In our preliminary prospective, non-interventional study to examine the side effects of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer (NCT03872141), patients with breast cancer who received standard of care single agent weekly taxane-based chemotherapy were assessed at baseline, midpoint, and end of treatment for neurological and cognitive changes and for blood levels of potential protein biomarkers (n = 13). CIPN and CRCI both showed an increase in severity with accumulating taxane and these changes were compared to protein alternations over the course of treatment. Using peripheral blood collected from patients (n = 10) during chemotherapy and tested with an antibody array curated by the MD Anderson RPPA Core), we found that 19 proteins were increased, and 12 proteins decreased over 12 weeks of treatment. Among those downregulate were proteins known to be critical for neuronal viability and function including GRB2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) and NCS1 (neuronal calcium sensor 1). Concurrently, proteins associated with apoptosis, including BAK1 (Bcl-1 homologous antagonist/killer), were upregulated. These results support the proposal that CIPN and CRCI increase with increasing taxane exposure, and identified several proteins that are altered with taxane exposure that could be implicated in their pathogenesis. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for progressive neurological changes and the rationale to investigate the molecular basis for these changes with the goal of target identification for mitigation of these neurological side effects."
https://openalex.org/W4303449219,"Current diagnostic methods used in Central Nervous System Tuberculosis (CNS TB) are limited by the paucibacillary nature of this form of tuberculosis. Posterior pituitary bright spot (PPBS) refers to an area of T1 hyperintensity in the posterior pituitary in MR imaging of the brain. It is found in 80-90% of healthy children and adults. In children with CNS TB, nearly half have absence of PPBS. This finding has not been described in adults. Our study looked for absence of PPBS in MR imaging and its association with CNS tuberculosis.To study prevalence of the absence of PPBS in patients with CNS tuberculosis when compared to a control group of normal patients.This was a retrospective case-control study of 100 patients with CNS tuberculosis and 200 controls (matched in 1:2 ratio) of patients with normal MRI brain. The MRI images were presented to a blinded radiologist in a randomised sequence to report for absence of PPBS. The data was subsequently analysed to look for association of absence of PPBS with CNS tuberculosis.Absence of PPBS (cases (47%), controls (8.5%)) was significantly associated with CNS tuberculosis in (Odds ratio-7.90, 95%CI 4.04-15.44, P-value<0.0001). The specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and positive likelihood ratio are 91.5%, 47%, 73.4% and 5.53 respectively. Adding of absence of PPBS as an additional radiological feature in diagnosis of CNS TB increased the sensitivity from 77% to 84%.Absence of PPBS is significantly associated with CNS tuberculosis and could be a relatively simple diagnostic aid in the diagnosis of CNS tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W4303449262,"High field MRI is an advanced technique for diagnostic and research purposes on animal models, such as the Beagle dog. In this context, studies on neuroscience applications, e.g. aging and neuro-pathologies, are currently increasing. This led to a need for reference values, in terms of volumetric assessment, for the structures typically involved. Nowadays, several canine brain MRI atlases have been provided. However, no reports are available regarding the measurements' reproducibility and little is known about the effect of formalin on MRI segmentation. Here, we assessed the segmentation variability of selected structures among operators (two operators segmented the same data) in a sample of 11 Beagle dogs. Then, we analyzed, for one Beagle dog, the longitudinal volumetric changes of these structures. We considered four conditions: in vivo, post mortem (after euthanasia), ex vivo (brain extracted and studied after 1 month in formalin, and after 12 months). The MRI data were collected with a 3 T scanner. Our findings suggest that the segmentation procedure was overall reproducible since only slight statistical differences were detected. In the post mortem/ ex vivo comparison, most structures showed a higher contrast, thereby leading to greater reproducibility between operators. We observed a net increase in the volume of the studied structures. This could be justified by the intrinsic relaxation time changes observed because of the formalin fixation. This led to an improvement in brain structure visualization and segmentation. To conclude, MRI-based segmentation seems to be a useful and accurate tool that allows longitudinal studies on formalin-fixed brains."

The sample included 237 12- to 15-year-old adolescents from Argentina. The level of positive emotions and prosocial behavior toward strangers, friends and family in the adolescent intervention group increased through the three evaluation periods. The Hero program was focused on recognizing one’s own emotions and provided an opportunity to reflect on different positive aspects of life, thus allowing a change in perspective related to immediate negative events. Moreover, the program provided an opportunity to change adolescents’ perspective from personal worries to concerns about others, including friends, family members, and even strangers in need."
https://openalex.org/W4303500815,"Vast stretches of India comes under meteorological drought this year or the other. A huge population base in rural India are rendered highly vulnerable to this drought because of their primary dependency on agriculture and in turn they may respond through temporary migration out of the drought affected rural areas in search of alternative livelihoods. This study aims to investigate the association between drought and temporary migration in rural India by fitting binary logistic regression models on a cross-sectional dataset involving both National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) 64 th round data and India Meteorological Department (IMD) rainfall data. The paper also examines whether this association varies across the different socio-economic groups. Out of the total temporary migrants generated in rural India in the study period, 99.46% migrated internally and 67.12% were rural to urban migrants. The study finds that there is a positive association between drought instances and probability of a household to have at least one temporary migrant member in rural India (OR 1.64 with p&lt;0.001) while controlling all other covariates. The study also concludes that the probability of temporary migration on account of drought is more severe among the socio-economically marginalised sections of the rural population compared to their better-off counterparts."

Therefore, this study examined the association between hearing loss and physical function in the general population.This cross-sectional study was conducted with health checkup participants who underwent pure-tone audiometry at a regional health care center in Japan. Information for physical function included handgrip strength, vital capacity (VC), and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). A hearing threshold of >30 dB at 1 kHz and/or >40 dB at 4 kHz in either ear was identified as hearing loss. The characteristics of the subjects were examined with stratification by sex and age group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the association between hearing loss and physical function with adjustments for age, body mass index and current smoking.Among the 4766 study subjects, 56.5% were male. The mean age was 47.7 years (SD: 13.8 years; range: 20-86 years), and the prevalence of hearing loss was 12.8% based on the definition stated above. For females, handgrip strength, VC, and FEV1 showed significant negative associations with hearing loss (multivariable-adjusted OR [95% CI] = 0.691 [0.560-0.852], 0.542 [0.307-0.959], and 0.370 [0.183-0.747], respectively). These associations were not found in males.Higher physical function was associated with a lower prevalence of hearing loss among females. This study suggests that it is important to maintain physical function for hearing loss in females. Further studies are required to investigate sex differences in the relationship between physical function and hearing loss in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W4303516608,"How does the central nervous system (CNS) control our bodies, including hundreds of degrees of freedom (DoFs)? A hypothesis to reduce the number of DoFs posits that the CNS controls groups of joints or muscles (i.e., modules) rather than each joint or muscle independently. Another hypothesis posits that the CNS primarily controls motion components relevant to task achievements (i.e., task-relevant components). Although the two hypotheses are examined intensively, the relationship between the two concepts remains unknown, e.g., unimportant modules may possess task-relevant information. Here, we propose a framework of task-relevant modules, i.e., modules relevant to task achievements, while combining the two concepts mentioned above in a data-driven manner. To examine the possible role of the task-relevant modules, we examined the modulation of the task-relevant modules in a motor adaptation paradigm in which trial-to-trial modifications of motor output are observable. The task-relevant modules, rather than conventional modules, showed adaptation-dependent modulations, indicating the relevance of task-relevant modules to trial-to-trial updates of motor output. Our method provides insight into motor control and adaptation via an integrated framework of modules and task-relevant components."

The aim of our study was to analyze the kinetics of metal contamination after MIRPE and after bar removal. Methods We prospectively assessed nickel and chromium changes in blood, urine, and local tissue in patients undergoing MIRPE with stainless-steel bar(s). Baseline samples were taken prior to surgery, further samples were taken at six defined time points until 30 months after bar removal. Clinical symptoms were evaluated at the time of every sample collection. Results 28 patients were included (mean age 16.4 years). At four weeks after MIRPE and persisting up to bar removal, we found significantly elevated trace metal levels in blood and urine. Tissue nickel and chromium levels were significantly elevated at the time of bar removal. After bar removal, the concentration of trace metal in urine and the concentration of chromium in plasma decreased gradually. In contrast, nickel levels in blood further increased. Five patients showed irritative symptoms after MIRPE, all symptomatic patients had elevated metal levels. Conclusions Following MIRPE, we found a rapid systemic increase of nickel and chromium. Our data indicate that trace metal release could cause irritative symptoms. The prolonged elevated systemic nickel levels beyond bar removal necessitate further investigations of the long-term side effects of MIRPE."

In reality, this is unlikely to be true and often people lack information about all alternatives that are available to them; either because the information is unavailable or that the cost of searching for and evaluating that information is high. In this paper, we develop a simple and tractable model that captures satisficing behavior. We show that the model can retrieve consistent parameters under a large range of experimental conditions. We test our model on synthetic data and present an empirical application. We discuss the implications of our results for the use of satisficing choice models in explaining choice."
