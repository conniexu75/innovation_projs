https://openalex.org/W1594856996,"Attack by reactive oxygen intermediates, common to many kinds of cell/tissue injury, has been implicated in the development of diabetic and other vascular diseases. Such oxygen-free radicals can be generated by advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are nonenzymatically glycated and oxidized proteins. Since cellular interactions of AGEs are mediated by specific cellular binding proteins, receptor for AGE (RAGE) and the lactoferrin-like polypeptide (LF-L), we tested the hypothesis that AGE ligands tethered to the complex of RAGE and LF-L could induce oxidant stress. AGE albumin or AGEs immunoisolated from diabetic plasma resulted in induction of endothelial cell (EC) oxidant stress, including the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and resulted in the activation of NF-kappa B, each of which was blocked by antibodies to AGE receptor polypeptides and by antioxidants. Infusion of AGE albumin into normal animals led to the appearance of malondialdehyde determinants in the vessel wall and increased TBARS in the tissues, activation of NF-kappa B, and induction of heme oxygenase mRNA. AGE-induced oxidant stress was inhibited by pretreatment of animals with either antibodies to the AGE receptor/binding proteins or antioxidants. These data indicate that interaction of AGEs with cellular targets, such as ECs, leads to oxidant stress resulting in changes in gene expression and other cellular properties, potentially contributing to the development of vascular lesions. Further studies will be required to dissect whether oxidant stress occurs on the cell surface or at an intracellular locus."
https://openalex.org/W1560667802,"Ligand-induced activation of many receptors leads to dissociation of the alpha- and beta gamma-subunit complexes of heterotrimeric G proteins, both of which regulate a variety of effector molecules involved in cellular signaling processes. In one case, a cytosolic enzyme, the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) binds to the dissociated, prenylated, membrane-anchored beta gamma-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (G beta gamma) and is thereby targeted to its membrane-bound receptor substrate. Quite recently, numerous proteins involved in cellular signal transduction have been shown to contain sequences homologous with a originally identified in the protein pleckstrin (pleckstrin homology domain; PH domain) and subsequently found in the G beta gamma interaction region of the beta ARK sequence. Here we demonstrate that glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins, containing sequences encompassing the PH domain of nine proteins from this group, bind G beta gamma to varying extents. Binding of G beta gamma to these fusion proteins was documented either by a direct binding assay or by ability to block G beta gamma-mediated membrane translocation of beta ARK1. G beta gamma binding to these fusion proteins was inhibited by the alpha subunit of Go (Go alpha), indicating that the binding of G beta gamma to G alpha and the PH domain-containing fusion proteins is mutually exclusive. Studies with a series of truncated PH domains derived from the Ras-guanine-nucleotide-releasing factor indicate that the G beta gamma binding domain includes only the C-terminal portion of the PH domain and sequences just distal to this. Protein-protein interactions between G beta gamma and PH domain-containing proteins may play a significant role in cellular signaling analogous to that previously demonstrated for Src homology 2 and 3 domains."
https://openalex.org/W1534435141,"Yeast uracil permease follows the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated on serine residues in a post-Golgi compartment. The protein was found to be rather stable in growing cells, but its turnover rate (half-life of about 7 h) was much faster than that of most yeast proteins. Several adverse conditions triggered the rapid degradation of uracil permease, and so a loss of uracil uptake. Turnover was rapid when yeast cells were starved of either nitrogen, phosphate, or carbon, and as they approached the stationary growth phase. Rapid permease degradation was also promoted by the inhibition of protein synthesis. The degradation of uracil permease in response to several stresses was strikingly slower in the two mutants, end3 and end4, that are deficient in the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, internalization is the first step in the permease degradative pathway. Uracil permease is degraded in the vacuole, since pep4 mutant cells lacking vacuolar protease activities accumulated large amounts of uracil permease, which was located within the vacuole by immunofluorescence. We have yet to determine whether adverse conditions enhance permease endocytosis and subsequent degradation or divert internalized uracil permease from a recycling to a degradative pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1515271603,"Bovine chromaffin cells are nondividing primary secretory cells that store and secrete catecholamine and a variety of proteins including chromogranins, opiate peptides, and opiate precursors. A transient transfection technique based upon the expression of human growth hormone as a reporter for the regulated secretory pathway was used to study the role of a Ras-like, GTP-binding protein, Rab3a, in Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry revealed that growth hormone and Rab proteins were coexpressed in the same cells. Overexpression of the wild type protein and expression of a mutant protein Rab3aQ81L both inhibited nicotinic agonist-stimulated exocytosis in intact cells. Expression of Rab3aQ81L also inhibited Ca(2+)-dependent secretion from permeabilized cells. Two other mutants, Rab3aN135I and Rab3aT36N, which correspond to dominant acting mutants of Ras, caused limited and no inhibition, respectively, of agonist-stimulated exocytosis. These data provide direct evidence that Rab3a plays an important role in Ca(2+)-triggered exocytosis. We suggest that Rab3a is an inhibitor of secretion, perhaps as part of a pre-fusion complex with secretory vesicles. Elevated Ca2+ may trigger exocytosis by overcoming the inhibition by Rab3a."
https://openalex.org/W1586297781,"Scavenger receptors have been reported to mediate macrophage adhesion to serum-coated plastic surfaces. We report here that scavenger receptors promote the divalent cation independent adhesion of human monocytes and macrophages to surfaces coated with non-enzymatically glycated collagen IV but not to surfaces coated with native collagen IV. Ligands for scavenger receptor types I and II blocked adhesion of monocytes and macrophages to non-enzymatically glycated collagen IV but had no effect on adhesion of these cells to albumin-coated surfaces. U937 human promonocyte-like cells transfected with cDNA encoding bovine scavenger receptor I or II adhered to surfaces coated with glycated-collagen IV but not to surfaces coated with native collagen IV. A synthetic peptide homologous to the domain of bovine scavenger receptor that binds modified low density lipoproteins (residues 327-343) inhibited the adhesion of U937 cells transfected with cDNA encoding bovine scavenger receptor II to glycated collagen IV, whereas a control peptide from the alpha helical domain of scavenger receptor II (residues 121-137) had no effect on adhesion of these cells. Macrophages plated on surfaces coated with glycated collagen IV were unable to endocytose acetylated low density lipoproteins from the medium, suggesting that their scavenger receptors were occupied in binding these cells to the substrate. These findings suggest new roles for scavenger receptors in the accelerated development of vascular lesions observed in diabetics."
https://openalex.org/W1536723145,"Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is phosphorylated in contracting smooth muscle. The rate of phosphorylation of MLCK is slower than the rates of increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations and phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin in intact tracheal smooth muscle cells in culture. In permeable cells, increasing the Ca2+ concentration increased the extent of myosin light chain and MLCK phosphorylation. The Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal phosphorylation was 500 nM for MLCK and 250 nM for myosin light chain. Addition of KN-62 or a synthetic peptide CK II, inhibitors of multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity, abolished MLCK phosphorylation. Under these conditions, the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal light chain phosphorylation decreased to 170 nM. Thus, the Ca2+ concentrations required for MLCK phosphorylation are greater than those required for light chain phosphorylation in smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, phosphorylation of MLCK decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of light chain phosphorylation. These results can be explained by a regulatory scheme in which calmodulin available for myosin light chain kinase activation is limiting. This is supported by the retention of calmodulin when tracheal smooth muscle cells and tissues are permeabilized in relaxing solution and by the low mobility of rhodamine-calmodulin in intact tracheal smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564262044,"Glycosyl phosphatidylinositols (GPIs) anchor many proteins to the surface of eukaryotic cells and may also serve as sorting signals on proteins and participate in signal transduction. We have isolated a Saccharomyces cerevisiae GPI anchoring mutant, gpi1, using a colony screen for cells blocked in [3H]inositol incorporation into protein. The gpi1 mutant is defective in vitro in the synthesis of N-acetylglucosaminyl phosphatidylinositol, the first intermediate in GPI synthesis, and is also temperature-sensitive for growth. Completion of the first step in GPI assembly is therefore required for growth of the unicellular eukaryote S. cerevisiae. GPI synthesis could therefore be exploited as a target for antifungal or antiparasitic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1523946871,"The white, brown, and scarlet genes of Drosophila melanogaster encode three proteins that belong to the Traffic ATPase superfamily of transmembrane permeases and are involved in the transport of guanine and tryptophan (precursors of the red and brown eye pigments). We have determined the nucleotide sequences of two mutant white alleles (wco2 and wBwx) that cause reduced red pigmentation but have no effect on brown pigmentation. In wco2 the effect is only observed when interacting with the bw6 allele or a newly isolated allele (bwT50). These alleles of the brown gene were cloned and sequenced. In wco2 the codon for glycine 588 is changed to encode serine; in wBwx the triplet ATC encoding isoleucine 581 is deleted; asparagine 638 is changed to threonine in bw6, and glycine 578 is changed to aspartate in bwT50. No other relevant changes to the gene structures were detected. P-element-mediated germline transduction was used to construct a fly strain containing a white gene with a mutation of the nucleotide binding domain. Such flies had white eyes, indicating that the mutated white gene was unable to support either guanine or tryptophan transport. The implications of these mutations are discussed in terms of a model of the Drosophila pigment precursor transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1545938141,"The beta proteins in amyloid deposits of Alzheimer's disease have been found to be racemized and/or isomerized at their Asp residues (Roher, A. E., Lowenson, J. D., Clarke, S., Wolkow, C., Wang, R., Cotter, R. J., Reardon, I. M., Zurcher-Neely, H. A., Heinrikson, R. L., Ball, M. J., and Greenberg, B. D. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3072-3083). To elucidate the effect of racemization on the aggregation properties of beta proteins, we synthesized four beta protein analogues in which D-Asp was substituted for L-Asp residues, i.e. normal beta 1-35, [D-Asp7]beta 1-35, [D-Asp23]beta 1-35, and [D-Asp7,D-Asp23]beta 1-35. The aggregation and fibril formation of the peptides were examined by means of spectrophotometry, sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and electron microscopy. Of the four peptides, [D-Asp23]beta 1-35 showed the earliest increase in turbidity and appearance of a smear in SDS-PAGE. This was followed by [D-Asp7,D-Asp23]beta 1-35 and normal beta 1-35. [D-Asp7]beta 1-35 was considerably delayed in showing these signs of aggregation. Corresponding with the increase in turbidity and the appearance of a smear in SDS-PAGE, fibril formation was observed in electron microscopy. These results reveal that the aggregation properties of beta 1-35 peptides are affected by racemization of their Asp residues depending on their position. Racemization at amino acid position 23 accelerated the peptide aggregation and fibril formation, while that at position 7 slowed down this reaction. This suggests that the site-specific racemization of beta protein may be involved in the amyloid fibril formation in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1530373462,"Bcl-2 is thought to associate spontaneously with membranes via a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain by a mechanism analogous to that of cytochrome b5. We have examined the association of Bcl-2 with a variety of highly purified intracellular membranes in vitro. Fusion proteins were used to assess directly the role of the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain of Bcl-2 in membrane association. Although this domain of Bcl-2 was sufficient to promote the association of a normally cytosolic polypeptide with either microsomal or mitochondrial membranes additional nonhydrophobic amino-terminal residues were required for membrane integration. Furthermore, direct comparison of membrane binding of Bcl-2 and cytochrome b5 revealed that similar to cytochrome b5, membrane targeting of Bcl-2 was not dependent on protease-sensitive components of the recipient membranes. In competition experiments, cytochrome b5 demonstrated the expected preference for integration into endoplasmic reticulum membranes. In contrast, the data presented here suggest that Bcl-2 is targeted to the cytoplasmic surface of multiple intracellular membranes, both in vitro and in human leukemic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1507214593,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs), formed as the result of the extended interaction of proteins with ketoses, modulate central properties of endothelial cells and mononuclear phagocytes by interacting with a cell surface binding site comprised of a novel integral membrane protein (receptor for AGE = RAGE) and a lactoferrin-like polypeptide (LF-L), the latter having sequence identity to lactoferrin (LF). To further understand this cellular binding site, the interaction of RAGE with LF-L and LF was characterized. By ligand blotting and a solid state competitive binding assay, 125I-LF-L and 125I-LF bound to RAGE immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes or polypropylene tubes in a time-dependent and reversible manner, demonstrating a high affinity component with Kd approximately 100 pM. The interaction of 125I-LF-L and 125I-LF with RAGE was independent of iron in LF and was competed by addition of an excess of unlabeled carboxyl-terminal portion of LF. Cross-linking studies with purified 125I-LF-L and RAGE, in the presence of disuccinimidyl suberate, showed a new, slowly migrating band, corresponding to a complex of RAGE and LF-L, and cross-linking on mouse aortic endothelial cells showed two new slowly migrating bands on immunoblotting visualized with both anti-RAGE IgG and anti-LF-L IgG. These data lead us to propose that the endothelial cell surface binding site for AGEs consists of LF-L bound noncovalently to RAGE anchored in the cell membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1534127135,"The carboxyl terminus of yeast plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase is an autoinhibitory domain, and its effect is counteracted by modification of the enzyme triggered by glucose metabolism (Portillo, F., Larrinoa, I. F., and Serrano, R. (1989) FEBS Lett. 247, 381-385). To identify interacting domains involved in this regulation, we have performed intragenic suppressor analysis. A double mutation at the carboxyl terminus (S911A/T912A) results in no activation of the ATPase by glucose and lack of yeast growth on this sugar (Portillo, F., Eraso, P., and Serrano, R. (1991) FEBS Lett. 287, 71-74). Random in vitro mutagenesis of this mutant ATPase gene resulted in 29 revertants. Six corresponded to full revertants of the initial double mutation. Fourteen suppressor (second-site) mutations are located within three functional domains of the enzyme. Four mutations (A165V, V169I/D170N, A350T, and A351T) are localized at the cytoplasmic ends of predicted transmembrane helices 2 and 4; six mutations (P536L, A565T, G587N, G648S, P669L, and G670S) map within the proposed ATP binding domain, and the other four substitutions (P890opa, S896F, R898K, and M907I) are located at the carboxyl terminus. These results demonstrate the interaction, direct or indirect, between these three domains far apart in the linear sequence of the ATPase. All the second-site mutations caused constitutive activation of the ATPase in the absence of glucose metabolism. Second-site mutations at the carboxyl terminus were close to Ser-899 and suggested phosphorylation of this amino acid during glucose activation. Accordingly, the introduction of a negative charge, in a S899D mutant constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, partially mimics the glucose effect on the ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1585479491,"Populations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with both high and low affinity for EGF are found on the surface of cells. It has been hypothesized that the high-affinity state of the EGFR represents the receptor dimer and that this is also the kinase-active form. We describe here studies aimed at addressing this question directly. To stabilize homodimers of EGFR, we have generated a mutated form of the receptor by inserting a cysteine residue in the extracellular juxtamembranous region, in order to cross-link the extracellular domains of two receptors via disulfide bond formation. The mutation resulted in ligand-induced appearance of covalently linked EGF receptor dimers and, in parallel, increased the number of high-affinity receptors present on the surface of cells expressing the mutated EGFR. Comparison of the tyrosine kinase activity of the covalently linked dimeric and the monomeric forms of the EGF receptor, separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, showed that the dimer was significantly more active than monomer in the phosphorylation of exogenous substrate. We conclude that the dimeric form of the EGF-receptor represents the active form, and that dimer formation is associated with the appearance of high-affinity binding EGF receptors on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1951841199,"A double-stranded RNA adenosine deaminase that catalyzes the conversion of adenosines to inosines in duplex RNA substrates was purified to near homogeneity from Xenopus laevis eggs. The final specific activity was approximately 2.0 nmol of inosine min-1 mg-1 at 25 degrees C and pH 7.9 with a 794-base pair RNA substrate. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a single major approximately 120-kDa protein band by silver staining. The purified enzyme migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 90 +/- 10 kDa during high performance liquid chromatography. Gel filtration of the partially purified enzyme gave an apparent molecular mass of 210 +/- 20 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme may dimerize or associate with other cellular components. Substrate modification was inhibited by excess substrate, thiol reagents, heparin, and moderate concentrations of monovalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1523498832,"p18 is a phosphoprotein that is expressed at very high levels in leukemic cells, at moderately high levels in proliferating normal lymphocytes, and at low levels in quiescent lymphocytes. Induction of terminal differentiation of leukemic cells in culture results in a decrease in cellular proliferation. These phenotypic changes are associated with rapid phosphorylation of p18, followed by a more gradual decrease in the level of its mRNA expression. More than 12 different phosphorylation products of p18 have been identified in different cells by high resolution two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Previous studies have suggested that p18 may be a substrate for protein kinase C in some cellular processes and protein kinase A in others. In this report, we show that the phosphorylation of p18 increases as cells progress toward the G2-M phases of the cell cycle in proliferating leukemic cells. We have examined the hypothesis that the putative role of p18 in cellular proliferation may be mediated by its involvement in the p34cdc2 kinase signal transduction pathway. We have produced recombinant p18 in bacterial cells and shown that it can be phosphorylated in vitro by purified p34cdc2 kinase with a stoichiometry of 0.86 mol of PO4/mol of substrate. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that the site of p34cdc2 phosphorylation is the serine at position 38. This same site has previously been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo in bovine brain along with another serine at position 25. The observation that p18 gets phosphorylated in the G2-M phases of the cell cycle and the demonstration that p18 is phosphorylated efficiently by p34cdc2 kinase in vitro at a residue that is also phosphorylated in vivo support the hypothesis that p18 may be a physiologic substrate for p34cdc2 kinase in vivo. We have also examined the effect of inhibiting the expression of p18 on cell cycle progression. These experiments demonstrated that antisense inhibition of the expression of p18 in K562 erythroleukemia cells is associated with a decrease in cellular proliferation and accumulation of cells in the G2-M phases of the cycle. The implications of these findings to the proposed role of p18 in the regulation of cellular proliferation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1511477623,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play an important role in mediating agonist-specific desensitization of numerous G protein-coupled receptors. GRK5, a recently identified member of the GRK family, undergoes a rapid phospholipid-stimulated autophosphorylation to a stoichiometry of approximately 2 mol of phosphate/mol of GRK5. The ability of phospholipids to stimulate autophosphorylation is largely blocked by a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the last 102 amino acids of GRK5 (amino acids 489-590), suggesting that this is a primary region involved in GRK5/phospholipid interaction. Phosphoamino acid determination and mutagenesis studies demonstrate that autophosphorylation of GRK5 occurs primarily at residues Ser-484 and Thr-485. Expression and characterization of a mutant GRK5 that does not autophosphorylate (S484A and T485A) reveals that the mutant has a approximately 15-20-fold reduced ability to phosphorylate the beta 2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin compared to wild type GRK5. These results suggest that phospholipid-stimulated autophosphorylation may represent a novel mechanism for membrane association and regulation of GRK5 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1536336415,"Soluble forms of human betacellulin (BTC) were purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of mouse A9 cells transfected with the BTC precursor cDNA. Three types of soluble BTC, designated BTC-1a, BTC-1b and BTC-2, were resolved by cation-exchange and size-exclusion column chromatography. Physicochemical analysis has revealed that BTC-1a represents the glycosylated, intact molecule composed of 80 amino acid residues (Asp32 to Tyr111 of the precursor molecule). BTC-1b appears to be a truncated molecule lacking 12 amino acid residues from the amino terminus of BTC-1a. BTC-2 was found to be a 50-amino acid molecule (Arg62 to Tyr111) that corresponds to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) structural unit. The biological activities of these BTC molecules were essentially identical as judged by their mitogenicity on Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts. BTC and EGF were equipotent in stimulating Balb/c 3T3 cell proliferation and rat mesangial cell Ca2+ mobilization as well as in inhibiting the growth of human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. BTC and EGF antagonized each other with similar dose dependence for binding to A431 cells, indicating that these factors bind the same receptor molecules with equivalent avidity. The Kd value of EGF receptor (EGFR) and BTC is 0.5 nM as determined on Balb/c 3T3 cells. In addition, human mammary carcinoma MDA-MB-453 cells, which express multiple members of the EGFR family, were found to possess 2.7 x 10(3) BTC binding sites/cell, and the binding was readily quenched by EGF. These results suggest that the primary receptor for BTC is EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W1510433114,"Methylmercury transport across liver canalicular membranes into bile, a major route of excretion of this toxic compound, is dependent upon intracellular GSH, and a glutathione-methylmercury complex (CH3Hg.SG) has been detected in liver tissue and bile. To examine whether the CH3Hg.SG complex is itself transported across the canalicular membrane and to identify the transport system involved, studies were performed in isolated rat liver canalicular plasma membrane vesicles. Uptake of CH3(203)Hg.SG (10 microM) into an osmotically active space was temperature-sensitive and unaffected by either ATP (5 mM) or an inwardly directed Na+ gradient (100 mM); however, CH3Hg.SG uptake was enhanced by a valinomycin-induced K+ diffusion potential (inside-positive) indicating that its transport was electrogenic. Transport of CH3Hg.SG exhibited saturation kinetics with both high affinity (Km = 12 +/- 2 microM, Vmax = 0.23 +/- 0.02 nmol.mg-1.20 s-1) and low affinity (Km = 1.47 +/- 0.22 mM, Vmax = 1.23 +/- 0.14 nmol.mg-1.20 s-1) components. Uptake of this complex was inhibited by GSH, the GSH analog ophthalmic acid, S-methyl, S-ethyl, S-butyl, S-hexyl, S-octyl, and S-dinitrophenyl glutathione, but not by GSSG, bile acids, amino acids, and P-glycoprotein inhibitors. Furthermore, GSH competitively inhibited (Ki = 83 microM) and trans-stimulated CH3Hg.SG uptake into the canalicular vesicles. These studies provide the first kinetic characterization of a transport system for glutathione-mercaptides and indicate that CH3Hg.SG is not a substrate for the ATP-dependent, canalicular GSSG or glutathione S-conjugate carriers, but appears to be a substrate for canalicular carriers that also transport GSH. Because efflux systems for GSH are found in all mammalian cells, transport of glutathione-metal complexes by such carriers may be a common mechanism for the removal of methylmercury and possibly other metals from cells."
https://openalex.org/W1550885428,"Diamine oxidase (histaminase), an enzyme that oxidatively deaminates putrescine and histamine, was purified from human placenta and from pig kidney. Both NH2-terminal sequences are highly homologous to the human kidney amiloride-binding protein, previously thought to be a component of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the pig kidney amiloride-binding protein immunoprecipitate a polypeptide with the same M(r) (105,000) as that of pig kidney diamine oxidase. That polypeptide has both diamine oxidase activity and the capacity to bind [3H]phenamil, a tritiated amiloride derivative. Cells stably transfected with human kidney amiloride-binding protein cDNA express a high diamine oxidase activity. In transfected cells as well as with the purified enzyme, this activity was inhibited by amiloride and by some of its derivatives, such as phenamil and ethylpropylamiloride. Amiloride inhibition seems to be due to drug binding at the active site of the enzyme. These data indicate that human placental diamine oxidase is identical to the human kidney amiloride-binding protein and that amiloride analogues may have wider physiological effects besides those on epithelial ion transport."
https://openalex.org/W1831559887,"The L-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) is a key enzyme of the glycolytic pathway mainly expressed in the liver. Rat liver contains a regulatory protein that inhibits glucokinase (GK) activity. The effect of this protein is greatly reinforced by the fructose 6-phosphate and antagonized by the fructose 1-phosphate (Van Schaftingen, E. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 179, 179-184). In hepatocytes, fructose in low concentrations is phosphorylated into fructose 1-phosphate, and therefore is able to active GK in the absence of insulin via the regulatory protein in the liver. In primary culture of rat hepatocytes, 0.2 mM fructose in the presence of 20 or 40 mM glucose stimulated the activity of the L-PK gene promoter fused with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, regardless of the addition of insulin, through the glucose/insulin response element. A constitutive GK expression vector co-transfected with the L-PK/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct is also able to confer an insulin-independent glucose responsiveness in hepatocytes. Thus, the insulin effect on glucose-dependent activation of the L-PK promoter is, under these experimental conditions, to permit glucose phosphorylation through the stimulation of the GK synthesis. In the presence of glucose, the L-PK promoter can also be activated by a post-translational GK activation, mediated by a low concentration of fructose acting via the regulatory protein of glucokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1489913822,"The activation properties of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-sensitive Ca2+ stores in permeabilized and intact hepatocytes were investigated by monitoring Mn2+ quench of fura-2 compartmentalized within these stores, as Mn2+ passed through InsP3-activated channels in a retrograde manner. In cells permeabilized in suspension the InsP3-sensitive pool size was dependent on InsP3 dose, and there was a large unresponsive compartment. By contrast, essentially all of the compartmentalized dye was accessible following activation of a small fraction of the InsP3 receptors in carefully permeabilized attached cells. After loading the cytosol of intact hepatocytes with Mn2+, both submaximal and maximal vasopressin doses caused complete quench of the entire intracellular pool of compartmentalized fura-2. Vasopressin-induced Mn2+ quench occurred in a stepwise manner at doses that gave cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, reflecting periodic opening of intracellular Ca2+ channels. Pretreatment with thapsigargin to eliminate feedback effects of Ca2+ fluxes converted the steps to a continuous quench. The data suggest that Ca2+ stores in attached permeabilized and intact hepatocytes are luminally connected, making the entire store accessible to InsP3. In cells permeabilized in suspension, GTP increased InsP3-sensitive pool size, and this effect was inhibited by cytochalasin B. GTP did not change the initial rate of Mn2+ quench but increased the proportion of slowly accessible stores in the InsP3-sensitive compartment, apparently by recruitment of InsP3-insensitive stores. Preincubation on ice or with cytoskeletal inhibitors dissociated slowly accessible compartments from the InsP3-sensitive stores in both intact and subsequently permeabilized attached hepatocytes. Addition of GTP to permeabilized cells reversed this disruption of store continuity. It is suggested that GTP- and cytoskeleton-dependent luminal communication between Ca2+ stores is an important determinant of function, which could modulate the availability of Ca2+ for release."
https://openalex.org/W1649524883,"Nuclear encoded thylakoid lumen proteins are imported into the chloroplast storma and further directed across thylakoid membranes by lumen targeting domains. Recently, we showed that there are two protein-specific pathways for transport into the lumen. This was unexpected in that lumen targeting domains have similar properties, all containing bacterial signal peptide motifs. Nevertheless, sequence homology analysis suggests that pathway specificity is determined by elements in the lumen targeting domain. To test this, we constructed and analyzed chimeric proteins in which transit peptides from proteins transported by one pathway were fused to the mature domains of proteins directed by the other. We also investigated the transport characteristics of a previously unexamined protein whose pathway was predicted by sequence similarity analysis. Our results confirm that lumen targeting domains contain pathway sorting elements and further indicate that distinct energy and stroma requirements for transport are pathway characteristics, unrelated to the passenger protein. These findings suggest the operation of two mechanistically different translocators."
https://openalex.org/W1638364188,"In rod outer segments the light activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE alpha beta gamma 2) is accomplished by removal of the gamma inhibitory subunit (PDE gamma) from the PDE alpha beta catalytic subunits. A light activation of the inositol signaling pathway also occurs, but there is little information linking these two signal transduction pathways. Here we report that protein kinase C (PKC) purified from bovine rod outer segment phosphorylates the bovine PDE gamma with incorporation of 0.9 +/- 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of PDE gamma. Phosphorylation of PDE gamma increases its ability to inhibit PDE alpha beta catalytic activity (trypsin-activated PDE, tPDE) with an IC50 for phosphorylated PDE gamma of 26 +/- 4 pM and an IC50 of 60 +/- 5 pM for unphosphorylated PDE gamma. Inhibition of tPDE by PDE gamma is characterized by two values of Kd, Kd1 = 34 pM and Kd2 = 760 pM. Phosphorylation of PDE gamma by PKC eliminates the functional heterogeneity of the PDE gamma population resulting in a single value of Kd = 23 pM. Free PDE gamma (without PDE alpha beta catalytic subunits) is a better substrate for PKC than PDE gamma in a complex with PDE alpha beta. Phosphorylation of free PDE gamma by PKC is characterized by a value of Vmax = 1,550 +/- 148 units/mg (Km = 21.0 +/- 1.9 microM). In contrast, phosphorylation of PDE gamma in PDE alpha beta gamma 2 complex has two values of Vmax, Vmax1 = 0.3 +/- 0.1 units/mg of PDE gamma (Km1 = 0.4 +/- 0.2 microM) and Vmax2 = 0.7 +/- 0.2 units/mg of PDE gamma (Km2 = 4.6 +/- 0.9 microM). ROS PKC phosphorylates Thr35 in PDE gamma. We have previously reported (Morrison, D. F., Rider, M. A., and Takemoto, D. J. (1987) FEBS Lett. 222, 266-270; Lipkin, V. M., Udovichenko, I. P., Bodarenko, V. A., Yurovskaya, A. A., Telnykh, E. V., and Skiba, N. P. (1990) Biomed. Sci. (Lond.) 1, 305-308) that the central fragment of PDE gamma (24-45) is responsible for binding to PDE catalytic subunits. The new data suggests that this region of PDE gamma also includes the site for phosphorylation by PKC and that phosphorylation increases the ability of PDE gamma to inhibit PDE catalytic activity. This altered regulation of visual transduction may play a role in desensitization or light adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W1488099175,"Using specific cDNAs isolated from mouse fibroblasts we determined tissue-specific expression of different matrix metalloproteinase genes: both stromelysin-1 and collagenase IV are highly expressed in heart and lung, whereas collagenase I is expressed most abundantly in skeletal muscle, kidney, and bone. High basal level expression of stromelysin-2 is found in heart and kidney. Like in man and rat, the expressions of collagenase I, stromelysin-1, and stromelysin-2 are regulated by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate and by UV irradiation, but not by cAMP. In contrast, the expression of the 72-kDa collagenase IV is not affected by either stimuli. We and others have shown previously that under cell culture conditions, the regulation of human collagenase I is regulated by the transcription factor Fos/Jun (AP-1). Here we show that in c-fos transgenic mice transcription of collagenase I is induced in thymus, spleen, and, most dominantly, in bone upon overexpression of Fos. Neither collagenase IV nor stromelysin-1 or stromelysin-2 expression is affected by c-Fos. The sites of induced collagenase I expression correlate with the sites of Fos-induced long-term cellular alterations in transgenic mice including bone remodeling and T cell development. In fact, in the developing bone tumors strongly enhanced levels of collagenase I transcripts were detectable. These results identify collagenase I as a Fos-regulated gene in vivo and suggest a possible role for Fos/Jun heterodimers in establishing the pathological phenotype of c-fos transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1600839161,"We have used a luciferase reporter gene under the transcriptional control of a cAMP response element as a sensitive monitor of the regulation by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) of intracellular cAMP levels and cAMP-regulated gene expression. Treatment with the muscarinic agonist carbachol results in an increase in luciferase activity in JEG-3 cells transiently transfected with mouse m1 (8-10-fold) and chick m4 (3-5-fold) mAChRs. Control experiments indicate that these responses are not due to a calcium-mediated pathway and are dependent upon a functional protein kinase A. The m1 and m4 responses are not sensitive to pertussus toxin and the m4 response was potentiated by it. Thus, these responses do not result from direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase by beta gamma subunits released from pertussis toxin-sensitive G-proteins. Atropine treatment of cells transfected with high levels of m4 mAChR, but not m1, causes an elevation in basal levels of cAMP response element-mediated luciferase expression in the absence of agonist. This suggests that the m4 receptor is spontaneously active and can cause constitutive inhibition of adenylyl cyclase that is relieved by atropine treatment. Surprisingly, the m4 receptor exhibits little if any agonist-induced inhibition of luciferase expression at either low or high levels of receptor expression. JEG-3 cells express Gi alpha-1 and Gi alpha-3 but not Gi alpha-2. Cotransfection of Gi alpha subunits with m4 demonstrates that the m4 receptor requires Gi alpha-2 for optimal agonist-mediated inhibition. Even in the presence of Gi alpha-2, high levels of receptor increased luciferase expression at high concentrations of agonist. Thus, the m4 mAChR can undergo a switch in functional coupling from inhibition to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. This switch is dependent on the level of receptor expression, the subtypes of G-proteins coexpressed with the receptor, and the concentration of agonist. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Gi alpha-2 G-protein alpha subunit preferentially couples the m4 mAChR to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in JEG-3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2132042374,"Human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) monomer consists of two domains, a larger NH2-terminal domain that contains catalytic residues and a smaller COOH-terminal domain that modulates substrate specificity and is a major determinant of heparin binding. Analyses of NH2-terminal domain function were performed after site-directed mutagenesis of the putative active-site serine residue, while COOH-terminal domain function was assessed following reaction with a monoclonal antibody. The native enzyme and mutant LPL in which serine 132 was replaced with alanine, cysteine, or glycine were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Mutant proteins were synthesized and secreted at levels comparable to native LPL; however, none of the mutants retained enzymatic activity. The mutant with alanine replacing serine 132 was purified and shown to be inactive with both esterase and lipase substrates; however, binding to a 1,2-didodecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine monolayer was comparable to native LPL. These results are consistent with a catalytic, and not a lipid binding, role for serine 132. To investigate the function of the smaller COOH-terminal domain, LPL lipolytic and esterolytic activities as well as heparin binding properties were determined after reaction with a monoclonal antibody specific for this domain. Lipolytic activity was inhibited by the monoclonal antibody, whereas esterolytic activity was only marginally affected, indicating that the LPL COOH-terminal domain is required for lipolysis, perhaps by promoting interaction with insoluble substrates. Also, the affinity of antibody-reacted LPL for heparin was not significantly different from that of LPL alone, suggesting that (i) the heparin-binding site is physically distinct from the COOH-terminal domain region required for lipolysis and (ii) binding of antibody did not cause dimer dissociation. A model is proposed for the two LPL domains fulfilling different roles in the lipolytic process."
https://openalex.org/W1575458145,"Rates of radiolytic inactivation of bacteria suspended in N2O-saturated solutions were dramatically increased over normal background levels when the media contained chloride or bicarbonate ions. The bacteria could be protected from this enhanced toxicity by the addition of free radical scavengers (ethanol, ascorbate, hydrogen peroxide, mannitol, glucose, EDTA, picolinic acid), indicating that the lethal reactions were extracellular in origin. Prior irradiation of chloride-containing solutions led to formation of hypochlorous acid, which was identified by detection of ring-chlorinated products when reacted with fluorescein. Prolonged irradiation of other solutions did not lead to accumulation of bactericidal agents; however, irradiation of bicarbonate-containing solutions in the presence of the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) led to formation of the EPR-detectable DMPO.CO3- adduct. The results are interpreted in terms of formation of secondary radicals, among which the carbonate and chlorine radicals are uniquely toxic to bacteria. From rate comparisons of the solution components, it was concluded that the reactions involving chloride ion are unlikely to be expressed in biological environments, but that the CO3- radical could be an important intermediary oxidant in peroxide-inflicted cellular damage, particularly in spatially confined environments such as the leukocyte phagosome."
https://openalex.org/W1604907458,"Somatostatin regulates diverse cellular effectors, including adenylyl cyclase, ion channels, and ion exchangers. We expressed two somatostatin receptor subtypes, SSTR1 and SSTR2, stably in mouse fibroblast Ltk- cells and transiently in human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells to investigate subtype-specific pharmacological and functional properties. The effects of GTP gamma S and pertussis toxin on [125I-Tyr11]somatostatin-14 binding indicated that SSTR2 may couple exclusively to pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, whereas SSTR1 may couple to both pertussis-sensitive and -insensitive G proteins. When expressed either stably or transiently, both receptor subtypes mediated somatostatin inhibition of cAMP accumulation by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. In contrast, only SSTR1 mediated somatostatin inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange activity, and this action was insensitive to pertussis toxin. We generated two chimeric receptors by replacing sequential residues of SSTR2 with cognate sequences of SSTR1 to identify molecular determinants unique to SSTR1 that may confer coupling to the exchanger. SSTCR4 included a SSTR1 segment encompassing determinants within the fifth and sixth hydrophobic domains and the entire third cytoplasmic loop, while SSTCR5 contained a SSTR1 segment spanning the second through sixth hydrophobic domains, including both second and third cytoplasmic loops. Although both chimeric receptors mediated somatostatin inhibition of cAMP accumulation, only SSTCR5 mediated the inhibition of Na(+)-H+ exchange activity, and this effect was pertussis-insensitive. These findings demonstrate both pharmacological and functional differences between SSTR1 and SSTR2. The ability of SSTR1 to selectively attenuate Na(+)-H+ exchange activity requires determinants outside the third cytoplasmic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1595717017,"This study investigates the influence of apolipoproteins on the structure and function of spheroidal, reconstituted high density lipoproteins (rHDL). Spheroidal rHDL containing apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, (A-I)rHDL, were prepared by incubating discoidal rHDL with low density lipoproteins and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. Spheroidal rHDL containing apoA-II, (A-II)rHDL, were prepared by displacing apoA-I from (A-I)rHDL with apoA-II. When the (A-I)rHDL were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, their migration was retarded relative to native HDL. The (A-II)rHDL migrated slower than either the (A-I)rHDL or native HDL. Spectroscopic studies showed that the packing order of the rHDL phospholipids was independent of apolipoprotein composition and that the polarity, or hydration, of the lipid-water interface of the (A-I)rHDL was greater than that of the (A-II)rHDL. When the rHDL were incubated with very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein, comparable amounts of cholesteryl ester (CE) were transferred from (A-I)rHDL and (A-II)rHDL to VLDL. The transfer of triglyceride (TG) from VLDL to (A-I)rHDL and (A-II)rHDL was also comparable. Similar results were obtained when Intralipid was substituted for VLDL. It is concluded that (i) apolipoproteins influence the surface charge of spheroidal rHDL, (ii) the hydration of the lipid-water interface of (A-I)rHDL is greater than that of (A-II)rHDL and (ii) cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated transfers of CE and TG between spheroidal rHDL and TG-rich particles are independent of rHDL apolipoprotein composition."
https://openalex.org/W1603278841,"A novel lipid-dependent protein kinase in human platelets was partially purified and characterized. This enzyme was calcium-independent and was selective for phosphatidic acid as a cofactor/activator with initial activation observed at approximately 2 mol % and peak activity achieved at 4 mol % phosphatidic acid. In the presence of phosphatidylserine, enzyme activation was observed with concentrations of phosphatidic acid as low as 0.5 mol % with peak activity at 2 mol %. Other anionic phospholipids also activated the enzyme but to a lesser extent and with less potency. Enzyme activity was independent of diacylglycerol or phorbol esters and the enzyme did not bind [3H]phorbol dibutyrate. In a soluble protein kinase assay, the enzyme was activated by cis-unsaturated fatty acids with maximum activation occurring at 5-10 microM sodium oleate. Western blot analysis showed that this enzyme did not cross-react immunologically with antibodies raised against the currently identified isoenzymes of protein kinase C. A number of additional biochemical criteria distinguished this enzyme from known isoenzymes of protein kinase C. These biochemical and immunologic data define a novel lipid-dependent protein kinase in human platelets. The role of this enzyme in signal transduction as a phosphatidic acid-activated enzyme and as a possible target for cis-unsaturated fatty acids is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2118799563,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a heparin-binding pleiotropic factor that acts on a variety of epithelial cells. The interaction of human HGF with glycolipids was studied by overlaying them with 125I-HGF on thin layer chromatograms and by a solid-phase assay using lipids adsorbed on microtiter plates. Among various glycolipids tested, HGF was found to bind to sulfoglycolipids, including galactosylceramide sulfate (SM4), lactosylceramide sulfate (SM3), and gangliotriaosylceramide bis-sulfate. In contrast, HGF failed to bind to gangliosides or neutral glycolipids. HGF binding to SM4 was strongly inhibited by dextran sulfate, heparin, and fucoidan, whereas neither keratan sulfate nor hyaluronic acid had any inhibitory activity. When glycolipids from a renal cancer cell line, SMKT-R3, which overexpresses sulfoglycolipids, were developed on a thin layer chromatogram, SM4 and SM3 were the only glycolipids that bound HGF. We further examined the effect of the incorporation of glycolipids into SMKT-R3 cells on HGF binding to the cells. The incorporation of SM4 into the cells enhanced HGF binding to SMKT-R3 cells, while that of galactosylceramide, a precursor of SM4, had no effect. These observations indicated that SM4 exogenously incorporated into the cell membranes could react with HGF and suggested that endogenous sulfoglycolipids on SMKT-R3 cells might function as reservoirs for HGF."
https://openalex.org/W1533290330,"Genes encoding neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exhibit restricted patterns of expression in the nervous system. We are interested in elucidating the molecular mechanisms responsible for establishing these patterns of expression. This paper presents the characterization of regulatory elements upstream of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 3 gene. We have identified a GC-rich multistart site promoter adjacent to the alpha 3 coding region. Similar alpha 3 start sites were identified in PC12 cells and sympathetic ganglion neurons, suggesting similar control mechanisms in the clonal line and peripheral neurons. The start site region lacks TATA-like sequences but does contain initiator-like sequences. We show, in transient transfection assays, that the POU domain transcription factor, SCIP/Tst-1, specifically activates alpha 3 in a neural context. Other POU domain factors tested only weakly activated or repressed alpha 3. Unexpectedly, we found that alpha 3 basal activity and SCIP/Tst-1 activation of alpha 3 is not dependent on the SCIP/Tst-1 binding sites found upstream of the gene. In addition, mutations in the SCIP/Tst-1 coding region that prevent the factor from binding to DNA with high affinity do not obliterate alpha 3 activation. These results lead us to propose that alpha 3 activation by SCIP/Tst-1 is achieved via protein-protein interactions between SCIP/Tst-1 and a specific complement of transcription factors that act directly on the promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2164831513,"The developmental expression of the alpha 2,6- and alpha 2,8-linked sialic acid (Sia) residues in trout egg polysialoglycoproteins (PSGPs) was studied by correlating the temporal expression of these sugar residues, and the prerequisite sialyltransferases responsible for their synthesis, during oogenesis. The following new findings are reported. 1) Disialylated glycoproteins were identified in ovaries 4-6 months prior to ovulation. Three months prior to ovulation, a second more highly sialylated glycoprotein appeared. Structural studies confirmed that the two glycoproteins were discrete molecular species, designated PSGP(low Sia) and PSGP(high Sia), which differed only in their Sia content. PSGP(low Sia) contained mostly disialyl (Sia alpha 2,8-Sia alpha 2,6-) side chains, whereas PSGP(high Sia) contained alpha 2,8-linked oligo/polySia side chains ranging in length from 2 to over 20 Sia residues. The average degree of polymerization ([DP]av) was 6. 2) Biosynthetic studies using CMP-[14C]Neu5Ac indicated that three sialyltransferase activities were responsible for synthesis of the polysialyl residues of PSGPs: (i) alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase (alpha 2,6-ST), which catalyzed formation of the Sia residues alpha 2,6-linked to the proximal GalNAc residues in asialo-PSGP; (ii) alpha 2,6-sialoside alpha 2,8-sialyltransferase (alpha 2,8-ST or initiase), which catalyzed transfer of the first alpha 2,8-Sia residue to the alpha 2,6-linked Sia residue; and (iii) an alpha 2,8-polysialyltransferase (alpha 2,8-polyST or polymerase), responsible for synthesis of the alpha 2,8-linked poly/oligo Sia chains in PSGP(high Sia). Expression of these enzyme activities increased in accordance with the developmental appearance of each PSGP. 3) Structural characterization of the [14C]Sia-labeled side chains of each PSGP at different stages of development confirmed that synthesis of the disialyl unit containing a single alpha 2,8-Sia residue occurred before alpha 2,8-polysialylation. 4) In ovaries, 96% of the sialyltransferase activities were found in the Golgi-derived immature cortical vesicles or as soluble enzymes released from the fragile vesicles. Less than 4% of the activities were localized in the membrane (Golgi) fraction. In mature eggs, the sialyltransferases were also detected as soluble enzymes, and within the cortical vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1525020117,"Purified bovine renal epithelial Na+ channels incorporated into planar lipid bilayer membranes were used to evaluate the biophysical consequences of its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA). We also studied the effects of pertussis toxin-induced ADP-ribosylation on single channel activity of nonphosphorylated and PKA-phosphorylated channels. PKA-induced phosphorylation resulted in a significant increase in single channel open probability (Po) with no change in single channel conductance, as well as increased the probability of multiple channel openings in the bilayer. Further, PKA conferred a voltage sensitivity to channel gating without affecting open channel conduction properties. PKA-phosphorylated Na+ channels were inhibited by subsequent ADP-ribosylation with pertussis toxin (PTX). Addition of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate reversed this inhibition. However, exposure of nonphosphorylated Na+ channels to PTX increased channel open probability by a factor of 3-5. These results demonstrate that a cAMP-dependent pathway is an important regulatory element for amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels and that the effects of PTX-induced ADP-ribosylation of the channel-associated Gi protein on function depend upon the previous phosphorylation state of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1540082250,"It has been proposed that the amino-terminal domain of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is critical for its stimulation of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. In this study, recombinant ARF1 (rARF1), r delta 13ARF1 (recombinant ARF1 lacking the first 13 amino acids) and rPKA14ARF1 (recombinant ARF1 in which the first 14 amino acids were replaced by the first 7 amino acids of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) were used to assess the effect of the amino terminus on the ability of ARF to enhance ADP-ribosylation of agmatine by the cholera toxin A subunit. The GTP-dependent ARF activities of r delta 13ARF1 and rPKA14ARF1 were similar to that of rARF1, whereas the GTP requirement for half-maximal activation of cholera toxin A, was somewhat higher for rARF1 than it was for r delta 13ARF1 and rPKA14ARF1. These results are consistent with the view that the amino terminus of ARF1 is not critical for its action as a GTP-dependent activator of cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1509665044,"Previous studies indicate that a human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS) gene enhancer (CSEn) associated with the growth hormone (hGH) gene locus is involved in directing cell-specific expression of the hCS genes in placenta. In the current studies, we report a detailed structural analysis of this enhancer. CSEn stimulated transcription of a variety of promoters, including the hCS, human growth hormone, thymidine kinase, and Rous sarcoma virus promoters, in human choriocarcinoma cell lines (BeWo and JEG-3) but not HeLa cells or rat somatolactotrophes (GC). Maximal enhancer activity was confined to a 242-base pair DNA segment. Of several CSEn subfragments, only the En 57/242 subfragment retained activity (33.5% wild-type). The CSEn DNA sequence contained direct and inverted repeat motifs and sequences related to the SV40 enhansons, GT-IIC, GT-I, and SphI/SphII. DNase I footprint analysis revealed that most of these sites were protected by nuclear proteins derived from BeWo, JEG-3, HeLa, and GC cells. Site-specific block mutation of the GT-IIC-related and inverted repeat motifs virtually abolished enhancer activity, and mutation of all but the GT-I-related motif resulted in significant loss (30-60%) of activity. These data demonstrate that the CS enhancer is comprised of multiple elements related to SV40 enhansons that interact cooperatively to generate enhancer function."
https://openalex.org/W1480606913,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectants expressing Escherichia coli folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS) activity solely in their cytosol lack mitochondrial folylpolyglutamates and are auxotrophic for glycine. Addition of a mammalian mitochondrial leader sequence targeted E. coli FPGS to the mitochondria of these cells. Mitochondrial expression of FPGS restored mitochondrial folylpolyglutamate pools and overcame the glycine requirement. Pteroyltriglutamates functioned as effectively as the longer glutamate chain length folates found in wild type CHO cells in the metabolic cycle of glycine synthesis provided they were located in the mitochondria. Although folypolyglutamates cannot enter the mitochondria, mitochondrial folylpolyglutamates can be released without prior hydrolysis and CHO transfectants expressing E. coli FPGS activity solely in the mitochondria possessed normal cytosolic folylpolyglutamate pools. The proportion of cellular folate in the mitochondrion is governed by competition between mitochondrial and cytosolic FPGS activities."

The purified E1 enzyme exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 150,000 Da, consistent with an alpha 2 beta 2 structure. The Km for pyruvate and kcat (30 degrees C) were found to be 0.9 +/- 0.2 microM and 0.47 +/- 0.03 s-1, respectively. The purified E1 alpha subunit existed as a monomer (42,000 Da), whereas the E1 beta subunit existed mainly (95%) in a tetrameric form (145,000 Da). Mixing equimolar amounts of the pure recombinant E1 alpha and E1 beta subunits in vitro generated a functional E1 enzyme with a molecular mass and an E1 activity similar to those of the E1(alpha 2 beta 2) enzyme purified from disrupted mixtures of cells containing individually expressed subunits. Mixing individual subunits in vitro with one of the subunits in excess resulted in complete assembly of the lesser subunit into the intact E1 (alpha 2 beta 2) enzyme. Thus, no chaperonin is needed in vitro to promote the assembly of the separate subunits to form the E1 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex of B. stearothermophilus."
https://openalex.org/W1533512774,"Certain forms of ceroid lipofuscinosis, a hereditary degenerative disease, are characterized by accumulation of large amounts of subunit c of mitochondrial ATP synthase in lysosomal storage bodies of numerous tissues. The subunit c protein appears to constitute a major fraction of the total storage body protein. In previous studies it was demonstrated that hydrolysates of total storage body protein from affected humans and sheep contain significant amounts of epsilon-N-trimethyllysine (TML). This finding suggested that one or both of the two lysine residues of subunit c might be methylated in the stored form of the protein. The normal subunit c protein from mitochondria does not appear to be methylated. Using a putative canine model for the juvenile form of ceroid lipofuscinosis, analyses were conducted to determine whether lysosomal storage of subunit c was accompanied by lysine methylation of this protein. In affected dogs, as in humans and sheep with hereditary ceroid lipofuscinosis, the storage bodies were found to contain large amounts of subunit c protein, as indicated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and partial amino acid sequence analysis. The subunit c protein partially purified from isolated storage bodies was found to contain lysine and TML in an almost equimolar ratio. Normal subunit c contains 2 lysine residues, one at position 7 and the other at position 43. Removal of the first 7 residues of the partially purified protein through sequential Edman degradation resulted in a dramatic increase in the TML to lysine ratio in the residual protein. This suggests that lysine residue 43 is methylated. Confirmation that residue 43 of the stored protein is TML was obtained by amino acid sequence analysis after cleavage of the protein with trypsin. This finding strongly suggests that specific methylation of lysine residue 43 of mitochondrial ATP synthase plays a central role in the lysosomal storage of this protein."

Unlike colchicine, it binds to tubulin very quickly, and yet it has powerful antimitotic properties. It has been demonstrated that the beta-tubulin isoforms differ significantly in their interactions with colchicine. In an effort to understand the role of the ring-B of colchicine, we have studied the interaction of DAAC with purified beta-tubulin isoforms. The association was studied fluorometrically using a stopped-flow instrument under pseudo-first-order conditions in the presence of a large excess of drug. The observed pseudo-first-order rate constants increased in a nonlinear way with the drug concentration, indicating that the binding of DAAC to tubulin isoforms occur in two steps as is true for the binding of colchicine to tubulin (Garland, D.L.

https://openalex.org/W1480159764,"Abstract The H(+)-ATPase from reticulocyte endosomes was purified and reconstituted into liposomes, and protein-dependent iron transport was observed. Reconstitution of the H(+)-ATPase into liposomes was performed by sonicating a lipid mixture, with a composition similar to the reticulocyte plasma membrane, in a buffer containing ferric citrate. The nonencapsulated iron:citrate was removed by gel filtration and the proteoliposomes diluted into 1 mM FerroZine. Upon addition of ascorbate, an initial efflux of 2.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(-2) mumol of iron/mg of ATPase/min and 56 +/-7% of total internal Fe(II) was detected by formation of the Fe(II)-FerroZine complex with an absorbance at 562 nm or radioactivity of 59Fe(II)-FerroZine following separation using gel filtration. Both thiosulfate and ferrocyanide could substitute for ascorbate. Citrate or EGTA could substitute for FerroZine. The initial rate of Fe(II) efflux was decreased by 41 or 17% using 100 microM of the cation channel inhibitor N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 70 microM of the ATP hydrolysis inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide, respectively, but was unaffected by the presence of ATP. The amount of iron transported was decreased 51 or 39% by 100 microM N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 70 microM of the ATPase inhibitor 7-chloro-4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole. The amount of Fe(III) transport was 80% lower than Fe(II) when reductants were not present internally or externally although the apparent rate constants were identical when ascorbate was externally present. These results suggest that this vacuolar H(+)-ATPase may transport iron."
https://openalex.org/W1502871917,"Abstract The Ser-beta 174 residue of the Escherichia coli H(+)-ATPase beta subunit has been shown to be near the catalytic site together with Gly-beta 149, Gly-beta 172, Glu-beta 192, and Val-beta 198 (Iwamoto, A., Park, M.-Y., Maeda, M., and Futai, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 3156-3160). In this study, we introduced various residues at position 174 and found that the larger the side chain volume of the residue introduced, the lower the enzyme activity became. The Phe-beta 174 mutant was defective in energy coupling between catalysis and transport, whereas the Leu-beta 174 mutant could couple efficiently, although both mutants had essentially the same ATPase activities (approximately 10% of the wild type). The defective energy coupling of the Phe-beta 174 mutant was suppressed by the second mutation (Arg-alpha 296-->Cys) in the alpha subunit. The Cys-alpha 296/Phe-beta 174 mutant had essentially the same membrane ATPase activity as the Phe-beta 174 single mutant when assayed under the conditions that stabilize the double mutant enzyme. These results indicate the importance of the alpha/beta interaction, especially that between the regions near Arg-alpha 296 and Ser-beta 174, for energy coupling in the H(+)-ATPase. The 2 residues (Ser-beta 174 and Arg-alpha 296) may be located nearby at the interface of the two subunits. About 1 mol of N-[14C]ethylmaleimide could bind to 1 mol of the alpha subunit of Cys-alpha 296/Phe-beta 174 or Cys-alpha 296 mutant ATPase, but could not inhibit the enzyme activity. This is the first intersubunit mutation/suppression approach to ATPase catalysis and its energy coupling."

Externally labeled SAP rapidly binds to two distinct forms of immobilized CRP (direct and phosphorylcholine captured) with a relatively high affinity (KD = 5 nM) at a molar ratio of specifically bound SAP/CRP = 0.3. Studies of binding inhibition using monoclonal antibodies to CRP or synthetic peptides of CRP revealed that residues 134-148 and the COOH-terminal region (residues 191-206) were recognized by SAP. A fragment of CRP consisting of the COOH-terminal 60 residues within each subunit was also selectively bound by SAP. The ability of immobilized CRP to bind SAP was distinguished from CRP's lectin-like binding reactivity since deglycosylated SAP retained its binding reactivity for CRP and sugars that inhibit CRP's lectin-like binding activity failed to inhibit binding. A peptide from trypsin digested SAP composed of residues 144-199 retained CRP binding activity, implicating the COOH-terminal region of SAP as the CRP recognition site."
https://openalex.org/W1590972073,"Cis-acting sequences that modulate ENO1 URS (upstream repression site) element activity were identified by base pair substitution mutagenesis. Base substitution mutations within three distinct regions of the 125-base pair URS element caused partial loss of URS activity in vivo. A URS element containing all three mutations was inactive. A binding site for the yeast REB1 protein was identified near the 5' terminus of the ENO1 URS element. Base substitution mutations that disrupted REB1 binding in vitro caused a 30% loss of URS activity in vivo. A second DNA binding activity was identified which also bound near the 5' terminus of the URS element. This latter binding activity was not antigenically related to REB1 nor was binding of this activity affected by base substitution mutations that abolished REB1 binding. Base substitution mutations within a second region of the ENO1 URS element caused a 38% loss of URS activity in vivo. The nucleotide sequence of this latter region is very similar to essential sequences within the URS elements from the yeast CAR1 and SSA1 genes, respectively. Base substitution mutations within a third region near the 3' terminus of the ENO1 URS element caused a 70% loss of URS activity in vivo. These latter sequences bound a partially purified factor that was distinct from REB1. These results showed that ENO1 URS element activity was modulated by multiple cis-acting sequences that bound distinct trans-acting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1615569413,"Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, is commonly used to inhibit the growth factor-induced signal transduction pathway at the post-receptor level. In this report, we examined the effect of staurosporine on the constitutive expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors in K562, a human erythroblastoid leukemic cell line. Exposure of these cells to staurosporine enhanced cell surface expression of TNF receptors by almost 7-fold in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Maximum induction occurred at a concentration of 20 nM of the agent for 16 h at 37 degrees C. Induction of the TNF receptor was found to be temperature-dependent. No induction was observed at 22 or at 4 degrees C, suggesting the role of cell metabolism. Scatchard analysis indicated an increase in receptor number without any change in receptor affinity. TNF receptors were induced by staurosporine on a wide variety of human cells of both epithelial (primarily p60 receptors) and myeloid (mainly p80 receptor) origin. Receptor-specific antibodies showed that both TNF receptors were induced. The induction was abolished by inhibitors of protein synthesis, thus suggesting the de novo synthesis of the receptor. Furthermore, we found that staurosporine had no effect on the internalization or shedding of the receptor, but it induced the mRNA for both forms of the TNF receptor. Inhibitors of tyrosine kinases had no effect on the induction of TNF receptors. Modulation of the receptor number by staurosporine correlated with the enhancement of antiproliferative effects of TNF against different tumor cells. Thus, overall these results indicate that protein kinase C may be involved in the signal transduction of TNF not only at the postreceptor level but also at the receptor level."
https://openalex.org/W1591559942,"Nuclear factor-interleukin-6 (NF-IL6), a member of the CCAAT box/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family, contains a basic domain-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding motif. Controlled protease digestion was used to probe free and DNA-complexed NF-IL6 protein. Digestion with trypsin in the absence of DNA produced the leucine zipper domain (containing residues 303-345). In contrast, digestion of NF-IL6.DNA complexes produced a stable domain, spanning residues 266-345, termed the tryptic core domain (TCD). The NH2-terminal boundary of the TCD is longer than tryptic peptides reported from C/EBP alpha.DNA complexes. Digestion of NF-IL6 with endoprotease Asp-N produced a domain smaller than the TCD (NF-IL6 bZIP domains (NFBD) (272-345)), a domain identified either in the absence or the presence of DNA. Both recombinant peptides bind acute-phase response element DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. The equilibrium disassociation constant (Kd) for the TCD was 36 +/- 8 nM, whereas the Kd for NFBD (272-345) was 283 +/- 160 nM. Moreover, in comparison with the TCD, NFBD (272-345) formed unstable DNA complexes with a 15-fold faster off-rate. We conclude that the amino acids represented between 266 and 272 termed the complex stabilizing subdomain, influences DNA complex formation independent of DNA binding specificity, and may be one mechanism for heterogeneity of DNA interaction by C/EBP family members."
https://openalex.org/W1583525381,"We have demonstrated that A375 melanoma cells express mRNA for both types of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors and receptor proteins on their plasma membranes. Specific agonist and blocking antibodies to either 55-kDa (TNF-R1) or 75-kDa (TNF-R2) TNF receptors combined with two-dimensional gel analysis were employed to determine which receptor type is responsible for mediating the induction of individual melanoma proteins. Our results indicate that the enhanced synthesis of proteins 21/>7 (M(r)/pI), 28/5.6, and 41/5.7 is selectively induced through TNF-R1. TNF induces these proteins; antagonist antibody to TNF-R1 prevents their induction by TNF, and TNF-R1 agonist induces them in the absence of TNF. Identification of these proteins by immunoblot analysis proved that 21/>7 is manganese superoxide dismutase, protein 28/5.6 is unrelated to 27/28-kDa heat shock protein, and protein 41/5.7 is plasminogen activator inhibitor-2. Furthermore, TNF cytotoxicity for A375 cells is also mediated by TNF-R1. These studies indicate that TNF-R1 is a critical signaling receptor for TNF action on A375 cells and demonstrate the potential use of TNF-R1 antibodies to selectively block or enhance specific effects of TNF on melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1489837340,"We have characterized the molecular species and subcellular distribution of Alzheimer beta/A4 amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neutrophilic granulocytes purified from human peripheral blood. APP was readily detectable in these cells. Immunochemical analysis with a panel of antibodies revealed that this APP species lacked the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains previously demonstrated in cell-associated APP. However, it contained a protease inhibitor domain of the Kunitz type, indicating that neutrophil APP is a potent inhibitor of certain serine proteases. Upon subcellular fractionation, APP was primarily localized to azurophilic granules, which are neutrophil-specific phagocytic organelles assigned to enzymatic digestion of invading microbes and dead or injured tissue. Apparently, in the neutrophil, a nonsecretory organelle stores truncated, soluble APP, a species previously found only in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid or in conditioned medium of cultured cells. Soluble APP in neutrophils may therefore have intracellular functions in addition to its previously described extracellular functions. These findings also indicate that there are previously uncharacterized cell-specific differences in processing, trafficking, and storage of the APP molecule. Finally, the precise subcellular localization of APP to neutrophil-specific phagocytic organelles is suggestive of a role for APP in the nonimmunological host defense."
https://openalex.org/W1589405273,"Eukaryotic DNA polymerase alpha pauses at some sites on the natural DNA template of M13mp2. Terminal misincorporations of dA or dG, in place of dT, by DNA polymerase alpha have been reported to be within one of the pause sites, pause site II (positions 6269 and 6270 (Fry, M., and Loeb, L.A. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 89, 763-767)). The DNA products arrested within pause site II (position 6270) were separated, annealed with synthetic templates, and further elongated by DNA polymerase alpha. It was confirmed that a considerable amount of terminal misincorporation of dG in place of dT occurred at this position. When M13mp2 DNA was coated with various amounts of replication protein-A (RP-A), however, DNA polymerase alpha was able to overcome the pause site II, whereas pause bands at other sites barely decreased. In contrast, Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein did not specifically abolish the arrested band at pause site II, though it generally suppressed the reaction. Since RP-A hardly increased the elongation frequency from the primer carrying a 3‘-mismatched terminal deoxynucleotide, the reduction of arrested products by RP-A may be attributed to the change in the incorporation mode from noncomplementary to complementary deoxynucleotides within pause site II and may not be due to the reinitiation from the mismatched 3‘-terminal deoxynucleotide. To confirm this, we amplified the reaction products at pause site III by means of a polymerase chain reaction method and showed that the complementary strand to pause site II, which was elongated in the presence of RP-A, did not carry any detectable misinsertion. Therefore, the errorprone step of the DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerase alpha may be readily avoided by RP-A."
https://openalex.org/W1543727079,"The muscarinic agonist carbachol produces a sustained elevation in the cytosolic free Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]i) by mobilizing an intracellular Mg2+ pool in rat sublingual mucous acini (Zhang, G. H., and Melvin, J.E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20721-20727). In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the agonist-induced mobilization of the intracellular Ca2+ store and Mg2+ movement in acini loaded with the Ca(2+)-selective chelator bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) by monitoring [Mg2+]i using dual wavelength microfluorometry of the Mg(2+)-sensitive fluorescent indicator mag-fura-2. The resting [Mg2+]i in BAPTA-loaded acini was comparable to unloaded acini (0.36 +/- 0.01 mM (n = 29) versus 0.35 +/- 0.01 mM (n = 119)). In contrast to the > 40% sustained increase in [Mg2+]i in unloaded acini, carbachol stimulation of BAPTA-loaded acini induced a rapid transient [Mg2+]i decrease (approximately 30%), followed by a slower recovery to the prestimulated [Mg2+]i in 3-4 min. Furthermore, in Ca(2+)-free medium or when Ca2+ influx was blocked with La3+ or Ni2+, carbachol induced a sustained decrease in [Mg2+]i (approximately 40%). Reintroducing extracellular Ca2+ resulted in recovery of [Mg2+]i, even in the absence of extracellular Mg2+. 8-(Di-ethylamino)octyl 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate, an inhibitor of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ release pathway, completely blocked the carbachol-induced decrease in [Mg2+]i, whereas thapsigargin, a Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor that empties the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ store, stimulated a decrease in [Mg2+]i. The thapsigargin-induced Mg2+ uptake was into the same intracellular pool as that activated by carbachol because stimulation with thapsigargin after carbachol did not induce a further decrease in [Mg2+]i. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that depletion of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ store activates Mg2+ uptake, most likely to maintain charge balance of the intracellular Ca2+ pool."
