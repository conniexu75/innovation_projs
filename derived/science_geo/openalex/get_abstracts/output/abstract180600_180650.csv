https://openalex.org/W1641228030,"Nuclear localization of the transcriptional activator NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappaB) is controlled in mammalian cells by three isoforms of NF-kappaB inhibitor protein: IkappaBalpha, -beta, and - epsilon. Based on simplifying reductions of the IkappaB-NF-kappaB signaling module in knockout cell lines, we present a computational model that describes the temporal control of NF-kappaB activation by the coordinated degradation and synthesis of IkappaB proteins. The model demonstrates that IkappaBalpha is responsible for strong negative feedback that allows for a fast turn-off of the NF-kappaB response, whereas IkappaBbeta and - epsilon function to reduce the system's oscillatory potential and stabilize NF-kappaB responses during longer stimulations. Bimodal signal-processing characteristics with respect to stimulus duration are revealed by the model and are shown to generate specificity in gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2091187766,"In young animals, monocular deprivation leads to an ocular dominance shift, whereas in adults after the critical period there is no such shift. Chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) inhibitory for axonal sprouting. We tested whether the developmental maturation of the ECM is inhibitory for experience-dependent plasticity in the visual cortex. The organization of CSPGs into perineuronal nets coincided with the end of the critical period and was delayed by dark rearing. After CSPG degradation with chondroitinase-ABC in adult rats, monocular deprivation caused an ocular dominance shift toward the nondeprived eye. The mature ECM is thus inhibitory for experience-dependent plasticity, and degradation of CSPGs reactivates cortical plasticity."

Fermionic lithium-6 atoms in an optical trap are evaporatively cooled to degeneracy using a magnetic field to induce strong, resonant interactions. Upon abruptly releasing the cloud from the trap, the gas is observed to expand rapidly in the transverse direction while remaining nearly stationary in the axial direction. We interpret the expansion dynamics in terms of collisionless superfluid and collisional hydrodynamics. For the data taken at the longest evaporation times, we find that collisional hydrodynamics does not provide a satisfactory explanation, whereas superfluidity is plausible."

Using a generalizable risk assessment approach and statistical models of fish introductions into the Great Lakes, North America, we developed a quantitative approach to target prevention efforts on species most likely to cause damage. Models correctly categorized established, quickly spreading, and nuisance fishes with 87 to 94% accuracy. We then identified fishes that pose a high risk to the Great Lakes if introduced from unintentional (ballast water) or intentional pathways (sport, pet, bait, and aquaculture industries)."

We applied this technique to Dictyostelium cells, focusing on the actin cytoskeleton. In actin networks reconstructed without prior removal of membranes or extraction of soluble proteins, the cross-linking of individual microfilaments, their branching angles, and membrane attachment sites can be analyzed. At a resolution of 5 to 6 nanometers, single macromolecules with distinct shapes, such as the 26S proteasome, can be identified in an unperturbed cellular environment."

The 410- and 660-kilometer mantle discontinuities are sharply defined, implying a lack of a subducting slab beneath the plateau. The discontinuities appear slightly deeper beneath northern Tibet, implying that the average temperature of the mantle above the transition zone is about 300°C hotter in the north than in the south. There is a prominent south-dipping converter in the uppermost mantle beneath northern Tibet that might represent the top of the Eurasian mantle lithosphere underthrusting the northern margin of the plateau."

https://openalex.org/W2133448529,"Rapid evolution of reproductive traits has been attributed to sexual selection arising from interaction between the sexes. However, little is known about the nature of selection driving the evolution of interacting sex-specific phenotypes. Using populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for divergent sperm length or female sperm-storage organ length, we experimentally show that male fertilization success is determined by an interaction between sperm and female morphology. In addition, sperm length evolution occurred as a correlated response to selection on the female reproductive tract. Giant sperm tails are the cellular equivalent of the peacock's tail, having evolved because females evolved reproductive tracts that selectively bias paternity in favor of males with longer sperm."

Here, we show that the consumption of alcohol in moderate doses induces a significant deterioration of the ability to detect the activation of erroneous responses as reflected in the amplitude of brain electrical activity associated with the ACC. This impairment was accompanied by failures to instigate performance adjustments after these errors. These findings offer insights into how the effects of alcohol on mediofrontal brain function may result in compromised performance."

Neurotrophins are key mediators of peripheral nervous system myelination. Our results show that myelin formation is inhibited in the absence of functional p75 NTR and enhanced by blocking TrkC activity. Moreover, the enhancement of myelin formation by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor is mediated by the p75 NTR receptor, whereas TrkC receptors are responsible for neurotrophin-3 inhibition. Thus p75 NTR and TrkC receptors have opposite effects on myelination."

https://openalex.org/W2021951421,"Obesity is an important public health problem associated with a number of disease states such as diabetes and arteriosclerosis. As such, an understanding of the mechanisms governing adipose tissue differentiation and function is of considerable importance. We recently reported that the Krüppel-like zinc finger transcription factor KLF15 can induce adipocyte maturation and GLUT4 expression. In this study, we identify that a second family member, KLF2/Lung Krüppel-like factor (LKLF), as a negative regulator of adipocyte differentiation. KLF2 is highly expressed in adipose tissue, and studies in cell lines and primary cells demonstrate that KLF2 is expressed in preadipocytes but not mature adipocytes. Constitutive overexpression of KLF2 but not KLF15 potently inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) expression with no effect on the upstream regulators C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ. However, the expression of C/EBPα and SREBP1c/ADD1 (adipocyte determination and differentiation factor-1/sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1), two factors that feedback in a positive manner to enhance PPARγ function, was also markedly reduced. In addition, transient transfection studies show that KLF2 directly inhibits PPARγ2 promoter activity (70% inhibition;p < 0.001). Using a combination of promoter mutational analysis and gel mobility shift assays, we have identified a binding site within the PPARγ2 promoter, which mediates this inhibitory effect.

Accumulating evidence derived from both clinical and experimental observations highlight the association of obesity with a number of chronic diseases such as type II diabetes, atherosclerosis, restrictive lung disease, cancer, and degenerative arthritis. Furthermore, there is growing recognition that a greater understanding of mechanisms regulating fat cell differentiation and the modulation of specific genes in the adipocyte may allow for novel strategies to limit obesity and its attendant consequences (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 2Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar). Current models of the transcriptional basis for adipocyte differentiation highlight an interplay among members of several major families, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP),1 the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family, and the basic-helix-loop-helix protein ADD1/SREBP1c (reviewed in Refs. 3Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar and4Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Studies to date suggest that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ induce PPARγ, which in turn initiates the adipogenic program (3Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Both gain and loss of function experiments argue strongly that PPARγ is necessary and sufficient to promote fat cell differentiation (5Barak Y. Nelson M.C. Ong E.S. Jones Y.Z. Ruiz-Lozano P.

C/EBPα has also been shown to play a critical role in certain aspects of adipogenesis (7Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Recent studies using C/EBPα null fibroblasts suggest that the critical role of this factor is to induce and maintain PPARγ levels as well as to confer insulin sensitivity to adipocytes (7Wu Z.

Finally, ADD1/SREBP1c can also promote adipogenesis. This probably occurs through several mechanisms including direct stimulation of PPARγ expression as well as production of the endogenous ligand that activates PPARγ (9Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M.

Members of this family are characterized by multiple zinc fingers containing regions with conserved sequencesC X 2C X 3FX 5LX 2H X 3H(X is any amino acid; underlined cysteine and histidine residues coordinate zinc) (12Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The zinc fingers are usually found at the C terminus of the protein and bind to the consensus sequence 5′-CNCCC′. The N terminus is involved in transcriptional activation and/or repression as well as protein-protein interaction (12Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Previous studies show that Krüppel-like proteins typically regulate critical aspects of cellular differentiation and function in diverse cell types (13Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 14Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H.

Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). A role for this gene family in adipocyte biology was recently demonstrated by studies from our laboratory showing that KLF15 is highly expressed in adipose tissue and can induce GLUT4 expression (17Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen(Banerjee) S. Depina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Upon further investigation, we found that KLF2/LKLF was also highly expressed in white and brown adipose tissue in mice. However, in contrast to KLF15, KLF2/LKLF is expressed in preadipocytes but not in mature adipocytes. In this report we provide evidence that KLF2 can function as a negative regulator of adipogenesis via inhibition of PPARγ. Adipocyte differentiation using 3T3L1 cells was performed as described previously (18Morrison R.F. Farmer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17088-17097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 10% FBS/DMEM until 2 days post-confluence (day 0). Medium was changed to 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mm MIX (3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin). After 48 h (day 2), medium was changed to 10% FBS/DMEM supplemented with 0.25 minsulin used at day 0. The media of the cultured cells were changed every 48 h during the experiment. Insulin was removed from the maintenance medium on day 4. For retroviral studies, KLF2 cDNA was cloned into the retroviral vector of green fluorescent protein (a gift of K. Murphy), and retrovirus was generated as described previously (19Ranganath S. Ouyang W. Bhattarcharya D. Sha W.C. Grupe A. Peltz G. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3822-3826PubMed Google Scholar). For infection of target cells, retroviral supernatant and 10% FBS/DMEM culture medium were mixed at 1:1 ratio and added to cells along with 4 μg/ml polybrene. Within 24–48 h, nearly 100% infectivity was noted by assessment for green fluorescent protein. Differentiation of cells was then performed as described above. Oil Red-O staining of intracellular lipid droplets was performed on plates overexpressing empty virus (EV), KLF2, and KLF15 as described previously (8Rosen E.D. Hsu C. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Human preadipocyte and adipocyte mRNA were kindly provided by Dr. H. Hauner (Dusseldorf, Germany), and RT-PCR was performed as described previously (20Hauner H. Skurk T. Wabitsch M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 155: 239-247PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hube F. Hauner H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The primer sequences used for KLF2 were sense 5′-CACCGACGACGACCTCAACA-3′ and antisense 5′-CGCACAGATGGCACTGGAAT-3′ (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for PPARγ were sense 5′-CCAGCATTTCTACTCCACATTA-3′ and antisense 5′-TCGTTCAAGTCAAGATTTACAA-3′ (Invitrogen). The primer sequences for GLUT4 were sense 5′-CGCAGAGAGCCACCCCAGGAAA-3′ and antisense 5′-GGGTGACGGGGTGGACGGAGAG-3′ (Invitrogen). For Sp1, the primer sequences were sense 5′-GTTCAGAGCATCAGACCCCTC-3′ and antisense 5′-GAGAGTGGCTCACAGCCTGTC-3′ (Invitrogen) (21Hube F. Hauner H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PPARγ2 promoter was kindly provided by J. K. Reddy (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). This plasmid was used as a template for the generation of the −250-bp Luc construct using the following primers: sense 5′-CGGGGTACCTTGTAATGTACCAAGTCTTG-3′ and antisense 5′-GGAAGATCTCATAACAGCATAAAACAGAG-3′. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BglII and ligated into theKpnI and BglII site of the luciferase expression vector pGL2-basic (Promega). The KLF binding site of PPARγ2–250-bp Luc was mutated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene). This mutation changed the wild-type sequence 5′-CCCACCTCTCCCA-3′ to 5′-GTGACCTCTGTGA-3′. For the transfection experiment, 3T3-L1 cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well, and transient transfections were performed the following day using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's recommendations. The total amount of DNA used for the transfection assay per well was always held constant to 1 μg. The KLF2 expression plasmid was kindly provided by J. Leiden (Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL). Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (16Segre J.A. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Promoter activity of each construct was expressed as the ratio of luciferase/β-galactoside activity. All transfections were performed in triplicate from three independent experiments. Gel mobility shift assays using the GST-KLF2 fusion protein were performed as described previously (22Denkinger D.J. Cushman-Vokoun A.M. Kawahara R.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Modifications of this procedure included a reduction in the amount of PMSF to 200 μg/ml. The radioactive wild-type probe was ∼10,000 cpm, and each reaction tube contained 1 μl of rabbit preimmune serum containing dextran (for enhanced binding). Competition studies were performed using 10×, 100×, and 1000× wild-type and mutant competitor. The sequence for the mutant competitor is the same as that used for the mutated primers above. For supershift studies, the anti-KLF2 antibody was kindly provided by J. Leiden (Abbott Laboratories). We recently reported that a member of the KLF family termed KLF15 is expressed in mature adipocytes and regulates GLUT4 (17Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen(Banerjee) S. Depina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In the course of these studies, we assessed the expression of several other KLFs in adipose tissue. KLF1 (erythroid KLF) and KLF4 (Guit KLF) mRNA were barely detected in mouse adipose tissue (Fig. 1 A) (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig. 1 A, KLF2 mRNA was strongly expressed in both white and brown adipose tissues. Given the availability of cell lines that faithfully recapitulate adipogenesis in vitro, we assessed the expression of KLF2 during 3T3-L1 differentiation (23Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1975; 5: 19-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). Stimulation of these cells with an empirically derived prodifferentiation mixture leads to a characteristic pattern of induction for various transcription factors and target genes involved in adipogenesis and lipogenesis. We observed that KLF2 mRNA was expressed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and markedly diminished upon adipocyte differentiation (Fig 1 B). As expected, other factors such as PPARγ, members of the C/EBP family, and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein were induced with 3T3-L1 differentiation. The expression pattern of KLF2 was most similar to two other transcription factors that have been shown to inhibit adipogenesis, termed GATA3 and 2 (Fig 1 B) (data not shown) (24Tong Q. Dalgin G., Xu, H. Ting C. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). To verify this expression pattern in primary cells, we assessed the expression of KLF2 in primary human preadipocytes and adipocytes by RT-PCR (21Hube F. Hauner H. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similar to the KLF2 expression pattern in 3T3-L1 cells, KLF2 is highly expressed in human preadipocytes and is markedly reduced in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with previous studies, GLUT4 and PPARγ expression are induced with differentiation, whereas Sp1 levels are minimally affected (Fig 1 C). The reduced expression of KLF2 mRNA expression during 3T3-L1 differentiation suggested a potentially inhibitory role in adipogenesis. To test this possibility directly, we retrovirally overexpressed KLF2 and EV as a control in 3T3-L1 cells and induced differentiation. In parallel, we also overexpressed KLF15, which has been shown to promote 3T3-L1 differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2 A, compared with EV-infected cells, KLF2-overexpressing cells showed a decrease in intracellular lipid accumulation as evidenced by reduced Oil-Red-O staining (Fig2 A). In contrast, KLF15-infected cells exhibited increased lipid accumulation. To determine the mechanism by which KLF2 may inhibit 3T3-L1 differentiation, we considered several possibilities. In theory, inhibition of adipocyte differentiation may occur via inhibition of factors that promote differentiation or induction of factors that inhibit adipogenesis. With respect to the latter, we did not observe any effect of KLF2 overexpression on known negative regulators of adipogenesis such as GATA3 (24Tong Q. Dalgin G., Xu, H. Ting C. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), β-catenin (25Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), Smad proteins (26Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), c/EBP-homologous protein (27Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), or pref-1 (25Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of KLF2 did not significantly alter mRNA levels of C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ, two upstream factors that promote adipogenesis (Fig. 2 B). In contrast, KLF2 overexpression potently inhibited PPARγ expression at all time points tested (Fig. 2 B). In addition, a strong inhibitory effect is seen on the expression of ADD1/SREBP1c and C/EBPα, two positive regulators of PPARγ expression and adipogenesis. Finally, the expression of downstream gene characteristics of a mature adipocyte such as adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, adipsin, and fatty acid synthase was also inhibited (Fig. 2 B) (data not shown). The inhibitory effect of KLF2 was specific because the other family member expressed in adipose tissue, KLF15, did not inhibit PPARγ expression (Fig. 2 C). Recent studies support a central role for PPARγ in adipogenesis. Given the potent inhibitory effect of KLF2 overexpression on PPARγ expression, we sought to determine the mechanistic basis for this observation. We considered several possibilities such as (a) direct inhibition of the PPARγ promoter or (b) inhibition of regulatory factor(s) that can induce PPARγ expression. With respect to the second possibility, we did observe a marked inhibition of two factors that have been demonstrated to positively regulate PPARγ function, C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP1c (Fig. 2 B). To assess the former possibility, we tested whether KLF2 may directly inhibit the promoter of PPARγ2, the major isoform in adipose tissue. Cotransfection of KLF2, the −250-bp Luc-PPARγ2 promoter, resulted in an ∼70% inhibition of promoter activity (Fig. 3 A, left panel). This inhibition was not seen with a mutant KLF2 construct consisting of only the zinc finger DNA-binding domain. Consistent with previous reports, members of the C/EBP family are able to transactivate the PPARγ2 promoter (Fig. 3 A, right panel) (28Zhu Y., Qi, C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). These data suggest that KLF2 inhibition of PPARγ2 may be mediated at the level of the promoter within the −250-bp proximal promoter region. An examination of this 250-bp region revealed the presence of a two-tandem Krüppel binding site, 5′-CCCACCTCTCCCA-3′ (base pairs −82 to >93). To determine whether KLF2 was able to bind this sequence, electrophoretic mobility gel shift studies were performed. As shown in Fig. 3 B, KLF2 is able to bind to this site (Fig. 3 B,arrow), and the specificity of this interaction was confirmed by competition with identical but not a mutated oligomer (5′-GTGACCTCTGTGA-3′). Furthermore, this DNA-protein complex was supershifted in the presence of an anti-KLF2 antibody (Fig. 3 B, arrowhead) but not IgG. To verify that this site was important in KLF2-mediated repression, we mutated the KLF binding site within the context of the −250-bp Luc-PPARγ2 promoter. As shown in Fig. 3C, mutation of this site significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of KLF2, suggesting that this site is important for KLF2-mediated inhibition of the PPARγ2 promoter. Members of the Krüppel-like family of transcription factors have been shown to play important roles in cellular differentiation and growth (12Bieker J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34355-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). KLF2 was initially identified through a homology screening strategy using the zinc finger domain of KLF1 as a probe (29Anderson K.P. Kern C.B. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B Mol. Cell. Biology. 1995; 15: 5957-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Studies targeting KLF2 in mice have shown an essential role in embryonic development as these animals die during mid-gestation because of abnormal blood vessel development (30Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P., Lu, M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, T-cell maturation (15Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) as well as lung development (31Wani M.A. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21180-21185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) is impaired. However, despite the importance of KLF2, very few direct targets have been identified (22Denkinger D.J. Cushman-Vokoun A.M. Kawahara R.S. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 281: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In this regard, the observations from this study may bear important implications not only for adipocyte biology but also for the role of KLF2 in other tissues. In this report, we provide evidence that the Krüppel-like factor KLF2 is a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Consistent with an inhibitory role, KLF2 is expressed in preadipocytes and expression is markedly reduced in mature adipocytes (Fig. 1). In addition, overexpression of KLF2 markedly inhibits lipid accumulation in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2). This ability is specific to KLF2, whereas another member of this family, KLF15, augments lipid accumulation. To understand the basis for the inhibitory effect of KLF2, we considered several possibilities such as (a) inhibition of factors that have been shown to positively regulate adipocyte differentiation or (b) induction of factors identified as negative regulators of adipocyte differentiation. With respect to the latter possibility, we did not observe any effect on the expression of several previously identified negative regulators such as GATA3 (24Tong Q. Dalgin G., Xu, H. Ting C. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), β-catenin (25Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), Smad proteins (26Choy L. Skillington J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 667-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), CHOP (27Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar), or pref-1 (32Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Cell. 1993; 73: 725-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). With respect to factors that promote adipogenesis, KLF2 did not significantly affect the expression of C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ, two upstream regulators of adipogenesis. In contrast, KLF2 potently inhibits the expression of PPARγ, the central regulator of adipogenesis. Given that PPARγ expression is essential for adipocyte development, it is probable that this inhibition is critical for KLF2-mediated inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. In addition to PPARγ, KLF2 also inhibits expression of both C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP1c, two factors that play important roles in adipocyte differentiation. A recent study (8Rosen E.D. Hsu C. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar) suggests that the principal role of C/EBPα is to induce and maintain PPARγ expression. As such, the inhibition of C/EBPα expression may contribute to the reduced levels of PPARγ seen in KLF2-overexpressing cells, thereby leading to the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, ADDI/SREBP1c has been shown to augment adipogenesis via direct induction of PPARγ expression as well as through production of an endogenous PPARγ ligand (9Kim J.B. Wright H.M. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4333-4337Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 10Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 11Fajas L. Schoonjans K. Gelman L. Kim J.B. Najib J. Martin G. Fruchart J.C. Briggs M. Spiegelman B.M. Auwerx J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5495-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The inhibition of ADD1/SREBP1c expression by KLF2 may therefore lead to both a reduction in PPARγ expression and activation. Thus, KLF2 may arrest the adipogenic program through inhibition of PPARγ expression and inhibition of factors that positively regulate PPARγ expression and function. The mechanism by which KLF2 is able to inhibit PPARγ expression has yet to be fully elucidated. As suggested above, part of the mechanism may be via the inhibition of factors such as C/EBPα and ADD1/SREBP 1c, which positively regulate PPARγ expression and function. However, our data also suggest that KLF2 can inhibit PPARγ2 promoter activity, thus supporting a direct mechanism. As shown in Fig. 3 C, KLF2 inhibited PPARγ2 promoter activity by ∼70%. An examination of the PPARγ2 promoter revealed the presence of a single consensus Krüppel binding site. Gel shift studies demonstrate that KLF2 can bind to this site (Fig. 3 B), and promoter mutation analyses support a role for this site in mediating the inhibitory effect of KLF2 (Fig. 3 C). Importantly, however, the mutation of this site alone was not sufficient to completely abrogate KLF2-mediated inhibition of promoter activity, suggesting that non-DNA binding-dependent mechanisms are probably involved for the full inhibitory effect. It is also noteworthy that the KLF binding site lies in between the two binding sites identified by Tong et al. (24Tong Q. Dalgin G., Xu, H. Ting C. Leiden J.M. Hotamisligil G.S. Science. 2000; 290: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) as essential for GATA-mediated inhibition of the PPARγ2 promoter activity. The proximity of these two sites raises the possibility of a cooperative interaction between these two factors and is the subject of future investigations. Our current understanding of the transcriptional basis for adipogenesis highlights the function of several major positive and negative regulatory families such as the C/EBPs, PPARs, and GATA factors. We recently reported (17Gray S. Feinberg M.W. Hull S. Kuo C.T. Watanabe M. Sen(Banerjee) S. Depina A. Haspel R. Jain M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34322-34328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) a role for the Krüppel-like factor KLF15 in adipocyte biology by virtue of its ability to induce the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4. In this report, we provide a novel function for another KLF family member, KLF2, as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Taken together, these studies support a role for the Krüppel-like factors as potential regulators of adipogenesis. Future studies evaluating these factors in vivo will help elucidate more precisely the role of Krüppel-like factors in adipocyte biology."

We show that bd1 encodes a putative ERF transcription factor that is conserved in different grasses and is expressed in a distinct domain of the spikelet meristem. Its expression pattern suggests that signaling pathways regulate meristem identity from lateral domains of the spikelet meristem."

To address this question, we studied the relative impacts of forest deterioration and fragmentation on bird species in 12 rainforest fragments in Kenya, combining 6 years of individual capture-recapture data with measurements of current captures and museum specimens. Species mobility, as estimated from species-specific dispersal rates, and tolerance to habitat deterioration, as estimated from change in fluctuating asymmetry with increasing habitat disturbance, explained 88% of the variation in patch occupancy among eight forest bird species. Occupancy increased with mobility and with tolerance to deterioration, where both variables contributed equally to this relationship. We conclude that individual-level study, such as of dispersal behavior and phenotypic development, can predict patterns of persistence at the species level. More generally, for conservation tactics to stand a high chance of success, they should include action both within sites, to minimize habitat deterioration, and across landscapes, to maximize dispersal."

The end point of the Hedgehog signal-transduction cascade is the Gli/Ci, zinc-finger transcription factors. Proteins such as Fused, Suppressor of fused (SUFU), Costal-2, and protein kinase A are essential for regulation of Gli/Ci processing, activity, and localization. Coimmunoprecipitation and Far Western assays, coupled with truncation analysis and mutagenesis have been used to define the region of interaction between Gli proteins and SUFU. We identify a novel motif SYGH in Gli/Ci family proteins, which is required for the interaction with SUFU. Mutational studies revealed that Gly122 and His123 are crucial for binding to SUFU, suggesting the importance of hydrophobicity for the correct binding conformation. Functional analysis revealed that the activity of GLI transcription factors with mutations in this motif is no longer suppressed by co-expression of SUFU. Moreover, we have found that a C-terminal 19-amino acid deletion in SUFU (Δ465) is sufficient to abrogate interaction with GLI1.

GLI1 was originally isolated as a highly amplified gene in a malignant glioma and subsequently implicated in the development of other tumor types, including liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and astrocytoma (1Kinzler K.W.

Later it was shown thatGLI1 encodes a transcription factor that is a downstream nuclear component of the Sonic hedgehog-patched signaling pathway. This pathway is evolutionary conserved and plays important roles in tissue patterning during early embryogenesis in vertebrates and invertebrates (4Hammerschmidt M. Brook A. McMahon A. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 14-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 5Ingham P.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 492-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition to GLI1, two other isoforms have been identified in vertebrates, Gli2 and Gli3, each encoded by separate genes (6Ruppert J.M. Vogelstein B. Arheden K. Kinzler K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5408-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). All Gli proteins bind to DNA through five Zn-finger domains that recognize the consensus sequence 5′-TGGGTGGTC-3′ (7Kinzler P.W. Ruppert J.M. Bigner S.H. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1988; 332: 371-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The role of each Gli isoform in mediating the hedgehog signal is not clear yet but recent studies have shown overlapping roles and indicated some functional redundancy (8Mo R. Freer A.M. Zinyk D.L. Crackower M.A. Michaud J. Heng H.H. Chik K.W. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Cheng S.H. Joyner A.L. Hui C. Development. 1997; 124: 113-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,9Bai C.H. Joyner A.L. Development. 2001; 128: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are indications that Gli1 is mainly a transcriptional activator, whereas Gli2 and Gli3 can act both as activators and repressors depending on specific post-translational modifications (10Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3914-3924Google Scholar). Gli proteins include both a nuclear export signal and a nuclear localization signal, suggesting that they shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Gli and Ci (Drosophila homolog of Gli proteins) are known to interact with a number of proteins such as the Ser/Thr kinase Fused (11Preat T. Therond P. Lamour-Isnard C. Limbourg-Bouchon B.

Amanai K. Wang B. Jiang J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2893-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This complex is assumed to receive and transmit a signal induced by hedgehog ligands to activate or repress certain genes. Moreover, Gli2 and Gli3 have potential binding sites for interaction with cAMP-response element-binding protein/p300 (a coactivator-acetyltransferase), whereas Gli1 lacks such a site (15Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). SUFU encodes a 484-amino acid cytoplasmic protein. Genetic screens inDrosophila first identified Su(fu) as a suppressor of mutants in the Fused serine/threonine kinase, a positive regulator of Hh signaling (12Pham A. Therond G. Alves G. Tournier F.B.

It has recently been demonstrated that SUFU acts as a negative regulator of Hh signaling. SUFU might inhibit the Hh signaling pathway through two distinct mechanisms: sequestration of Gli/Ci proteins in the cytoplasm (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B.

However, the precise role of SUFU is still unknown. Interestingly, loss-of-function mutations in SUFU were recently reported in medulloblastomas showing that SUFU is a human tumor-suppressor gene most likely because of its normal role as a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling (20Taylor M.D. Liu L. Raffel C. Hui C.C. Mainprize T.G. Zhang X. Agatep R. Chiappa S. Gao L. Lowrance A. Hao A. Goldstein A.M. Stavrou T. Scherer S.W. Dura W.T. Wainwright B. Squire J.A. Rutka J.T. Hogg D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Three alternatively spliced transcripts of SUFU with tissue specific expression have been identified. One SUFU variant has a trinucleotide insertion resulting in an extra glutamine and a protein of 485 amino acids. A second variant, SUFU-Lk, lacks exon 10 encoding a protein of 388 amino acids. The third variant, SUFU-Tt, has an extra exon after exon 8 (exon 8a) resulting in a protein containing 359 amino acids. The latter two of these variants have lost the ability to interact withGLI1 (21Grimm T. Teglund S. Tackels D. Sangiorgi E. Gurrieri F. Schwarts C. Toftgard R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In addition, an alternative splice variant of 433 amino acids lacking the C terminus was identified and reported to retain ability to suppress Gli-mediated activation of transcription (16Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S.-M. Ye W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J. Cell Science. 1999; 112: 4437-4448PubMed Google Scholar). These observations underscore the importance of the C-terminal domain of SUFU for biological function. Interaction domains for each individual protein involved in the intracellular signaling complex have not yet been precisely mapped, and no known protein-protein interaction motifs have been found by sequence analysis. Therefore, we decided to pinpoint domains of Gli proteins and SUFU, which specifically contribute to their interaction. We have used a combination of immunoprecipitation in vivo and in vitro and Far Western blot analysis to define the required fragment and specific amino acids of GLI1 that are essential for full SUFU-binding activity. We show that this fragment comprises residues 116–125, which are necessary for SUFU association. Designed mutant proteins corresponding to alterations in the SYGH amino acid motif within the interaction region selectively disrupted this protein-protein interaction. Functional analysis revealed that the activity of GLI transcription factors with mutations in this motif is no longer suppressed by co-expression of SUFU. We have also demonstrated the requirement of the C-terminal domain (19 amino acids) of SUFU for the interaction with GLI1. Deletion of these amino acids led to relocation of SUFU from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. We assume that this effect can be explained by loss of sequestering of SUFU in the cytoplasm. To express MYC-tagged and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged proteins, relevant sequences were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pCMV and pcDNA3 vectors. Sequences included full-length human GLI1 and SUFU. The deletion series of GLI1 such as GLI1-(55–407), -(78–407), -(111–407), -(125–407), -(424–1111) were also cloned in the same vectors. The following regions GLI1-(55–116), -(55–125), -(111–407), Gli2-(205–300); GLI3-(250–350) were used to generate thioredoxin fusion proteins. The fragments were PCR-amplified using specific primers and cloned into the pBAD/TOPO vector (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequence verified. Human 293T cells (embryonic kidney epithelial cell line) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding HA-tagged GLI1 or Myc-tagged SUFU using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before harvesting, cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and lysed in 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. Immunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies to the HA- or c-Myc epitopes conjugated with agarose. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected with antibodies to the HA or Myc epitopes, using the chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation in vitro was performed as follows; GLI1 fragments and SUFU were synthesized by in vitro translation in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (TNT, Promega). The in vitro translation mixture was diluted with 1× PBS buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies. Pellets were washed four times with 1× PBS or other washing conditions as indicated, resuspended in sample buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. TheEscherichia coli Top10 strain was transformed with different deletion constructs of GLI1. Fusion proteins were generated with the N-terminal-attached thioredoxin according to the manufacturer's protocol (pBAD/Topo®ThioFusion™ Expression System, Invitrogen). After induction with different concentrations of arabinose for 4 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole). The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the lysate was subjected to centrifugation for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. E. coli cells expressing GLI1 fragments were collected by centrifugation and lysed by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by staining with Ponceau-S (0.5% in 1% acetic acid). Membranes were blocked in buffer A containing 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% skim milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. SUFU probes were synthesized by coupled in vitrotranslation/transcription (Promega TNT with T7 RNA polymerase) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Reactions were diluted with buffer and passed over Millipore spin columns to remove unincorporated methionine. Subsequently, the blocked membranes were incubated for 1 h in the same buffer containing 35S-labeled SUFU. Filters were washed three times with buffer A, allowed to dry and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak). Point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. A fragment of GLI1 (55–407) in pBAD or full-length GLI1 in pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) were used as the template for mutagenesis. For all constructs, mutagenesis was confirmed by sequence analysis. The expression vectors for GLI1 and SUFU used in this study have been described previously (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The NIH-3T3 cell clone Shh-LIGHT having a stably incorporated GLI-luc reporter (22Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar) was used for the luciferase reporter assay. One day before transfection the cells were plated onto 24-well plates so that on the next day the cell density was ∼80%. Cells were transfected for 3 h using 0.4 μg of GLI1 wild-type or mutant DNA and 0.2 μg of SUFU DNA or empty vector using Biofect (InBio) according to the manufacturer's instructions at a ratio of DNA to Biofect of 1:3 (w/w). After 24 h the medium was replaced with low serum media and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. Subsequently cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase kit from Tropix (Bedford) according to the manufacturer′s instructions using an Ascent Fluoroscan combined fluori- and luminometer (Thermo LabSystems). All experiments were repeated three times and normalized for alkaline phosphatase activity. 293T cells were transfected with full-length SUFU or SUFU-Δ465 deletion constructs. To isolate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with hypotonic buffer (HEPES pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA). After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, cells were treated with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min. After recovery of supernatants representing cytoplasmic components, the pellets were washed twice with hypotonic buffer, centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min, and lysed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an anti-SUFU polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). As a first step we determined the affinity of the GLI1-SUFU interaction by examination of its sensitivity to elevated salt concentration. An N-terminal deletion construct (1–407) of GLI1 and Myc-tagged SUFU were produced by in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the translation mixture was subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-Myc antibody. GLI1 and SUFU associate with high affinity, as these associations occur in a 600 mm NaCl buffer (Fig. 1 A). It was previously shown that the GLI1 (1–407) amino acid region is capable of binding SUFU (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). To further analyze this interaction, we mapped the region of GLI1 required for interaction with SUFU. Expression constructs encoding different lengths of HA-tagged GLI1 were cotransfected into 293T cells with Myc-tagged SUFU. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the amino acid regions of GLI1 used for the experiments. GLI1 fragments and SUFU were coimmunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells using monoclonal antibodies specific for the Myc and HA epitope tags. The presence of the proteins in the immunoprecipitates was monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1,A and C). Proteins containing GLI1 fragments 111–407 and 78–407 interacted with SUFU, whereas GLI1 fragments containing amino acids 125–407 or 143–407 failed to maintain binding to SUFU. Thus, our results indicate that the N-terminal region of GLI1 including residues 111–125 defines a SUFU-binding domain. To confirm the importance of the 111–125 amino acid domain of GLI1 for the binding of SUFU, we constructed and expressed inE. coli a series of deletion derivatives of GLI1 fused with thioredoxin. Cleared bacterial lysates of each fusion protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The interaction of GLI1 fragments with SUFU was determined by Far-Western blot analysis using in vitro translated35S-labeled SUFU as a probe (Fig. 2). The GLI1 fragment including amino acids 55–407 was used as a positive control. Thioredoxin itself was used as a negative control. The GLI1 fragment including amino acids 55–116 failed to interact with SUFU. Inclusion of the 116–125 amino acid domain recovered SUFU binding. Thus, the results show that the minimal required region for GLI1-SUFU binding is amino acid residues 116–125 of GLI1. We aligned the pinpointed region to reveal the homology with other Gli/Ci proteins, as shown in Fig. 3 A. In addition, we used the PSI-BLAST program to detect weak but biologically relevant sequence similarities (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59759) Google Scholar). All identified proteins belong to the Gli/Ci transcription factor family. Four amino acids, SYGH, were highly conserved in all analyzed proteins including Ci. To confirm that similar regions of Gli2/Gli3 would be responsible for SUFU interaction, we designed deletion constructs of Gli2 and GLI3. The derivatives including amino acids 205–300 of Gli2 and amino acids 250–350 of GLI3, respectively, were positive in the Far Western assay and bound SUFU with similar efficiency (Fig. 3 B). Both fragments encompass the SYGH motif. Thus, SYGH is implicated as a required motif in all members of the Gli/Ci family to allow SUFU binding. To determine which amino acids in the SYGH motif of GLI1 are essential for the interaction with SUFU, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change conserved amino acids to alanine. Mutants were expressed in E. coli and tested for interaction by the Far Western assay. The results of the mutagenesis study are summarized in Fig. 4 A. Substitution of Ser120 to alanine resulted in SUFU binding with higher affinity. Mutation of the tyrosine at position 121 had no effect on the interaction. Mutations of the glycine residue at position 122 and the histidine residue at position 123 to alanine almost eliminated GLI1-SUFU interaction. In addition, we introduced double alanine substitutions of S120A and Y121A, which also led to reduced binding. These results indicate that amino acids Gly122 and His123 are critical for GLI1-SUFU interaction. The NetPhos 2.0 prediction program showed that the serine at position 120 is a good candidate for phosphorylation by serine kinases (score 0.814). Therefore, we assumed that phosphorylation of GLI1 might be involved in regulation of its regulation and localization. To test this hypothesis, we substituted Ser120 to glutamic acid, which would mimic a phosphorylated state of GLI1. Surprisingly, this replacement led to an increased affinity in comparison to wild-type, as did an alanine substitution (Fig. 4 B). Therefore, we conclude that most likely this substitution led to the alteration of protein folding. To further strengthen the functional relevance of the GLI1 mutations crucial for SUFU interaction, we used a reporter gene assay. SUFU, mutated G122A, and H123A GLI1 full-length proteins were co-expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and the effect of these mutations on GLI1-activated transcription was examined. This reporter was activated by wild-type GLI1, whereas SUFU itself had no effect (Fig. 4 C). Co-transfection of SUFU led to suppression of the reporter gene activation by GLI1. However, SUFU had no effect on activation of reporter gene activity by mutated G122A or H123A GLI1. Thus, these results confirm the importance of these amino acid residues of GLI1 for SUFU interaction. In addition, we observed that the activity of mutated forms of GLI1 was higher in comparison with wild-type. We assume that wild-type GLI1 transfected into NIH3T3 cells can form a complex with endogenous Sufu and can be sequestered in the cytoplasm, because NIH3T3 cells do express Sufu. Mutated GLI1 does not bind Sufu and may escape cytoplasmic retention. To map the region of SUFU required for interaction with GLI1, SUFU deletion constructs were tested using immunoprecipitation (Fig. 5, Aand B). Myc-tagged SUFU or its deletion constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells with HA-tagged GLI1 and immunoprecipitated with HA or c-Myc antibodies. The immunoprepicitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and detected with c-Myc or HA antibodies. The expression of all proteins was confirmed by Western blotting of whole-cell extracts (data not shown). C-terminal deletion constructs of SUFU (Δ465) and (Δ425) failed to interact with GLI1. These results indicate that the C terminus of SUFU is absolutely required for the formation of a complex with GLI1. To confirm the importance of the C-terminal domain of SUFU for the binding of GLI proteins, we constructed two N-terminal deletion derivatives of SUFU referred to as 100–484 and 200–484, respectively. Their interaction with GLI proteins was determined by Far Western blot analysis using in vitro translation for labeling (Fig. 5 B). We tested the following constructs of GLI proteins, GLI1 55–125, GLI2 205–300, and GLI3 250–350, expressed in E. coli. We detected an interaction of both SUFU-deletion derivatives with all GLI proteins. However, deletion of the SUFU N terminus led to reduced binding compared with wild-type. A possible explanation for this result could be that any truncations of SUFU affect the overall conformation of the protein and that tertiary structure is critical for interaction with GLI proteins. SUFU is assumed to be a cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling protein, because it is detected in both cytoplasm and nucleus (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 16Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S.-M. Ye W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J. Cell Science. 1999; 112: 4437-4448PubMed Google Scholar). Its localization might be an important factor in regulation of the Hh signaling pathway. To examine subcellular distribution of SUFU, we transfected 293T cells with either wild-type or C-terminally truncated SUFU (Δ465), and protein levels in cytosolic and nuclear fractions were detected by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6 A). The purity of the fractions was determined with lamin B antibodies as a marker for nuclear fractions (Fig. 6 A, lower panel). Whereas wild-type SUFU showed a predominant cytosolic localization, the C-terminally truncated form was mainly observed in the nuclear fraction. We also analyzed NIH3T3 cells, which express endogenous Sufu. The distribution of endogenous Sufu in NIH3T3 cells was similar to that observed in 293T cells transfected with wild-type SUFU (Fig. 6 B). The surprising pattern of nuclear localization of the SUFU (Δ465) mutant can be explained either by disruption of one or more SUFU interactions with other proteins, which might sequester SUFU in the cytoplasm, or a loss of ability to be exported from the nucleus. To determine whether the C-terminal deletion interferes with export of SUFU from the nucleus, we treated NIH3T3 cells with leptomycin B (LMB), a fungal metabolite that inhibits nuclear protein export by binding to the CRM1 receptor for nuclear export signals (24Kodo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 25Matise M.P. Joyner A.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7852-7859Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). LMB treatment for either 2 or 24 h had no effect on the subcellular distribution of endogenous Sufu. Most of the Sufu protein was present in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 6 C). These results suggest that Sufu is not exported from the nucleus through the CRM1/exportin pathway in NIH3T3 cells. Thus, it is likely that a motif within the twenty C-terminal amino acids has a role in mediating subcellular localization. In this study, using deletion analysis coupled with in vivo coexpression and Far Western assays, we have identified the required region, the 116–125 amino acid residues, within the GLI1 N-terminal region responsible for interaction with SUFU. Deletion of this domain resulted in a complete loss of its association with SUFU. Although N-terminal residue conservation in the Gli/Ci protein family is quite modest, a motif containing the SYGH amino acids is specifically conserved from fly to man (25; Fig. 3). Analysis of alanine-substitution mutants of the GLI1 SYGH motif strengthened its important role for SUFU interaction. We demonstrated that substitutions of the glycine residue at position 122 and the histidine residue at position 123 as well as the double mutant of Ser120 and Tyr121 led to a dramatic reduction in SUFU binding, indicating that they are essential for the GLI1-SUFU interaction. Thus, we have identified a novel motif, which is involved in protein-protein interactions within the biologically very important Hh signaling pathway. Next, our results demonstrated that substitution of Ser120to alanine enhanced binding of GLI1 to SUFU in comparison with wild-type GLI1. Because phosphorylation is a common mechanism for regulation of protein function, we assumed that phosphorylation of Ser120 would be functionally important for SUFU interaction. It has been demonstrated in Drosophila that Hh regulates the phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins such as Fused (26Therond P.P. Knight J.D. Kornberg T.B. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4224-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Costal-2 (27Robbins D.J. Nybakken K.E. Kobayashi R. Sisson J.C. Bishop J.M. Therond P.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 225-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), Ci (28Chen C.-H. von Kessler D.P. Park W. Wang B. Ma Y. Beachy P.A.

Gene Dev. 1999; 13: 2828-2837Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and Smoothened (30Denef N. Neubuser D. Perez L. Cohen S.M. Cell. 2000; 18: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (437) Google Scholar). However, binding to SUFU of GLI1 with a substitution of Ser120 to glutamic acid, which would mimic a phosphorylated state of GLI1, was also significantly increased. Therefore, it is more likely that mutated GLI1 undergoes a significant conformational rearrangement leading to stabilization of protein-protein binding. However, involvement of phosphorylation in regulation of GLI-SUFU interaction cannot be excluded. Thus, the specific roles of individual phosphorylation sites remain to be elucidated. Gli2 and GLI3 share many similar characteristics, whereas GLI1 is different. Whereas Gli2 and GLI3 contain both transcriptional activation and repression domains, GLI1 appears to contain only an activation domain (31Altaba A.R. Sanchez P. Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Truncation of the activation domain in the C terminus of Gli2 or GLI3 results in a protein with repressor activity, whereas removal of the repression domain at the N terminus converts them into strong activators (10Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3914-3924Google Scholar). The N-terminal repression domains of Gli2 and Gli3 do not overlap with their SUFU-binding sites. Therefore, it is unlikely that SUFU binding significantly contributes to the repressive activity of Gli2 and Gli3. Rather, the repressive activity might be associated with another conserved motif present in the N-terminal portions of Gli2 and Gli3 but not Gli1 (10Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3914-3924Google Scholar). Some reports indicate that both N- and C-terminal domains of GLI1 can be involved in interaction with SUFU. Reporter gene assays, using full-length Gli1 or a Gli1 deletion mutant lacking the N terminus, revealed that transcriptional transactivation was inhibited by SUFU in both cases (32Ding Q. Fukami S.-I. Meng X. Nishizaki Y. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Dlugosz A. Nakafuku M. Hui C.-C. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1119-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Ci, the Drosophila homolog of Gli proteins, interacts with SUFU within an N-terminal region that encompasses amino acids 244–346 (254SYGH257) (32Ding Q. Fukami S.-I. Meng X. Nishizaki Y. Zhang X.

Biol. 2002; 2: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal domain of GLI3, referred to as r1 (amino acids 274–353;333SYGH336), was reported to be sufficient for SUFU interaction (18Pearse II, R.V. Collier L.S. Scott M.P. Tabin C.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 212: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study we performed a functional luciferase reporter gene assay to examine transcriptional repression of point-mutated forms of GLI1 (G122A or H123A) by SUFU. These mutations essentially eliminate SUFU-GLI1 biochemical interaction. Our results revealed that cotransfection of SUFU did not inhibit transactivation by mutated forms of GLI1 in comparison with wild-type GLI1. Thus, substitution of one amino acid crucial for SUFU-GLI1 binding led to complete abrogation of SUFU suppression. These data suggest that this domain is the only one, which is functionally important in GLI-SUFU interaction. We also analyzed amino acid residues of SUFU involved in Gli binding. Deletion of 19 amino acids at the C terminus caused abrogation of SUFU-GLI1 interaction as shown by immunoprecipitation. Moreover, Far Western assay revealed that the N-terminal deletion derivatives of SUFU containing 100–484 and 200–484 amino acids retained the ability to bind Gli although with lower affinity. Our data strongly indicate that the C terminus of SUFU is required for interaction with Gli proteins. The results reported in the literature from analysis of SUFU domains involved in the interaction with Gli appear to be variable. 1) Using the yeast two-hybrid system, the central domain of mouse Sufu between residues 109–325 was shown to be required for the interaction. The results obtained with glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays showed that the N-terminal domain of Sufu (amino acids 13–173) could interact only with GLI3, whereas the C-terminal region (amino acids 174–484) could bind GLI1 and GLI3, but not Gli2 (35Simon-Chazottes D. Paces-Fessy M. Lamour-Isnard C. Guenet J.-L. Blanchet-Tournier M.-F. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the interaction domains of the Sufu protein with three Gli proteins are different. 2) An alternatively spliced isoform of SUFU, lacking 52 amino acids at the C terminus (referred to as SUFU 433), coimmunoprecipitated with GLI1 in transiently transfected 293 cells (16Stone D.M. Murone M. Luoh S.-M. Ye W. Armanini M.P. Gurney A. Phillips H. Brush J. Goddard A. de Sauvage F.J. Rosenthal A. J. Cell Science. 1999; 112: 4437-4448PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, it was concluded that the C terminus of SUFU (amino acids 433–484) is not involved in its interaction with Gli proteins. 3) Deletion of the C-terminal domain (amino acids 386–484) led to disruption of GLI1-SUFU interaction in the same cell type (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Similar results were found for two additional SUFU natural isoforms referred to as SUFU-Lk (amino acids 1–388) and SUFU-Tt (amino acids 1–359) lacking 96 and 125 amino acids at the C termini (21Grimm T. Teglund S. Tackels D. Sangiorgi E. Gurrieri F. Schwarts C. Toftgard R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the C-terminal domain (amino acids 386–484) is required for SUFU-Gli interaction. 4) SUFU lacking the C-terminal half (designated SUFU-Δex8) was not able to bind Gli proteins. In addition, the SUFU (212–484) mutant also lost this ability (20Taylor M.D. Liu L. Raffel C. Hui C.C. Mainprize T.G. Zhang X. Agatep R. Chiappa S. Gao L. Lowrance A. Hao A. Goldstein A.M. Stavrou T. Scherer S.W. Dura W.T. Wainwright B. Squire J.A. Rutka J.T. Hogg D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). A summary of these results is presented in Fig. 7. Based on available data, it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion about which domains of SUFU is crucial for the interaction with Gli proteins. The best way to resolve the discrepancies would be high resolution crystallographic studies of SUFU and the SUFU-Gli protein complex. As we show here, deletion of 19 amino acids at the C terminus of SUFU caused its relocalization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Similar results were found in SW-480 cells, where SUFU mutants with C-terminal deletions showed significant nuclear accumulation (36Meng X. Poon R. Zhang X. Cheah A. Ding Q. Hui C. Alman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, SUFU-Δex8 was localized in the nucleus as well (20Taylor M.D. Liu L. Raffel C. Hui C.C. Mainprize T.G. Zhang X. Agatep R. Chiappa S. Gao L. Lowrance A. Hao A. Goldstein A.M. Stavrou T. Scherer S.W. Dura W.T. Wainwright B. Squire J.A. Rutka J.T. Hogg D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The SUFU C-terminal domain shares no apparent sequence homology to any other proteins. Altered subcellular localization could be explained either by disruption of one or several interactions with other proteins, which sequester SUFU in the cytoplasm, or by a loss of ability to be exported from the nucleus. Meng et al. (36Meng X. Poon R. Zhang X. Cheah A. Ding Q. Hui C. Alman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have presented data suggesting that SUFU is actively exported from the nucleus, because it could be readily detected in the nuclear compartment of LMB-treated SW-480 cells. In contrast, no substantial nuclear accumulation of Myc-Sufu could be observed in untreated or LMB-treated wing discs in the Drosophila (17Methot N. Basler K. Development. 2000; 127: 4001-4010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, SUFU inhibited nuclear accumulation of GLI1 in the presence of LMB (13Kogerman P. Grimm T. Kogerman L. Krause D. Unden A.B. Sandstedt B. Toftgard R. Zaphiropoulos P.G. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 312-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Our results have further demonstrated that LMB treatment of NIH3T3 cells did not alter subcellular localization of endogenous Sufu. In addition, no concensus leucine-rich nuclear export signal is present in SUFU. Taken together, these data are most consistent with a model in which SUFU Δ465 relocates to the nucleus because it cannot be efficiently sequestered in the cytoplasm. However, additional work is necessary to identify the mechanism and protein factors involved in SUFU subcellular distribution.

https://openalex.org/W2003070042,"We performed high-resolution computer simulations of impacts into homogeneous and layered martian terrain analogs to try to account for the ages and characteristics of the martian meteorite collection found on Earth. We found that craters as small as ∼3 kilometers can eject ∼10 7 decimeter-sized fragments from Mars, which is enough to expect those fragments to appear in the terrestrial collection. This minimum crater diameter is at least four times smaller than previous estimates and depends on the physical composition of the target material. Terrain covered by a weak layer such as an impact-generated regolith requires larger, therefore rarer, impacts to eject meteorites. Because older terrain is more likely to be mantled with such material, we estimate that the martian meteorites will be biased toward younger ages, which is consistent with the meteorite collection."
https://openalex.org/W2024558548,"Infrared spectroscopy is used extensively in the study of isolated biomolecules, but it becomes less useful as it is applied to systems of increasing complexity. Even if the individual vibrational bands can be resolved spectroscopically, their assignment becomes problematic when they are more closely spaced than can be determined using ab initio methods. We describe a method that helps to alleviate this difficulty by measuring the direction of the vibrational transition moment for each vibrational band. The molecules of interest (adenine and cytosine) are cooled to 0.37 kelvin in liquid helium nanodroplets and oriented in a large dc electric field. A polarized infrared laser is then used to determine the directions of the infrared transition moments relative to the permanent dipole moment. Comparisons with ab initio calculations provide detailed structural information, including experimental evidence for nonplanarity of adenine and three tautomers of cytosine."

RNA degradation is mediated mostly by large multiprotein complexes like the degradosome in bacteria (1Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F. Raynal L.C.

There are only 3 known ribonucleases that are involved in RNA turnover in yeast mitochondria: Ynt20 (6Hanekamp T. Thorsness P.E. Curr.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because YNT20 andNUC1 are not essential for mitochondrial gene expression, their function is redundant (6Hanekamp T.

In contrast to this, the mitochondrial degradosome is necessary for mitochondrial biogenesis and mutations in its subunits lead to respiratory incompetence (9Stepien P.P. Margossian S.P. Landsman D.

Biotechnol. 1991; 4: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). So far only 2 genes encoding degradosome subunits have been identified:SUV3 encoding an 84-kDa putative RNA helicase that was shown to be a bona fide degradosome component (9Stepien P.P.

Cell. 1996; 84: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) andDSS1 encoding a 105-kDa putative hydrolytic exoribonuclease homologous to bacterial RNase II (10Dmochowska A. Golik P. Stepien P.P. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the case of Dss1p there was no direct proof that it is indeed part of the degradosome, but inactivation of the DSS1 gene resulted in a complete loss of degradosome activity in mitochondria (13Dziembowski A. Malewicz M. Mı́nczuk M. Golik P. Dmochowska A. Stepien P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The putative third (75 kDa) component remained to be identified. Inactivation of either the SUV3 or DSS1 genes gave similar phenotypes: respiratory incompetence, very strong inhibition of mitochondrial translation, and a variety of disturbances of RNA processing and stability, which finally lead to the loss of mitochondrial genomes (10Dmochowska A. Golik P. Stepien P.P. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Dziembowski A. Malewicz M. Mı́nczuk M. Golik P. Dmochowska A. Stepien P.P. Mol. Gen.

Szczepanek T. Bartnik E. Stepien P.P. Lazowska J. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Initially the research onSUV3 mutations was concentrated on their effect on intron metabolism. It has been shown that the ω intron from the 21 S rRNA transcript was accumulated up to 90-fold, other group I introns accumulated as well, but to a smaller extent (3Margossian S.P. Butow R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 392-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stepien P.P. Kokot L. Leski T. Bartnik E. Curr.

On the basis of these results it has been suggested that the physiological function of the degradosome is to protect mitochondria from a toxic effect of undegraded introns (12Margossian S.P., Li, H. Zassenhaus H.P. Butow R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The function of the mitochondrial degradosome is, however, not exclusively intron-related: we have shown that introduction of intronless mitochondrial genomes to ΔSUV3 and ΔDSS1 strains does not restore respiratory competence (13Dziembowski A. Malewicz M. Mı́nczuk M. Golik P. Dmochowska A. Stepien P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Stepien P.P. Kokot L. Leski T. Bartnik E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In such strains 15 S rRNA and COB mRNA were found to be unstable, moreover precursors of 21 S rRNA and VAR1 mRNA were present (13Dziembowski A. Malewicz M. Mı́nczuk M. Golik P. Dmochowska A. Stepien P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The above results indicated that more detailed analysis of the involvement of the degradosome in mitochondrial RNA metabolism is required. In the present study we have purified the degradosome using tandem affinity chromatography (17Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) and shown that in contrast to previously published data it contains only 2 large subunits (Suv3p and Dss1p). The complex co-purifies with mitochondrial ribosomes. We have shown that the degradosome has RNA helicase activity, which precedes and is essential for RNA hydrolysis by this complex. We present data that the Dss1 protein is responsible for exoribonuclease activity of the degradosome and that this activity is essential for mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, we have analyzed the influence of inactivation of degradosome components on mitochondrial RNA processing and have shown that the lack of degradosome activity causes aberrations of all processing steps of rRNA and mRNA, but not tRNA. For an analysis of phenotypes of SUV3 and DSS1 disruptions we used the previously described strains: BWG Δi (wt) (MAT a, his1, ade1, leu2, ura3), ΔSUV3 Δi (MAT a, his1, ade1, leu2, Suv3Δ::ura3), and ΔDSSΔi (MAT a, his1, ade1, leu2, Dss1 Δ::ura3) (10Dmochowska A. Golik P. Stepien P.P. Curr. Genet. 1995; 28: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 14Stepien P.P. Kokot L. Leski T. Bartnik E. Curr. Genet. 1995; 27: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Strains used for degradosome purifications were derived from W303. SUVTAP and DSSTAP were constructed by in vivo recombination as described in Ref. 17Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar using plasmid pBS1539 as template. Strain DSSSER was constructed by in vivo recombination. Strain W303 was transformed by the PCR product obtained on the template of total DNA from DSSTAP strain and primers: SER (TTATACAGGTCGACCTTTTAGACATGAAATGATTGGAGCTAAACAATCTTTGACAGTAAC) and CON (AACATGAATTAACACCATCGCAGCAACGAG). Primer SER contains the DSS1 gene coding sequence with a mutation changing tyrosine 814 to serine. The proper integration was confirmed by Western blotting and sequencing of PCR products. Diploid strains W303/DSSTAP and W303/DSSSER were constructed by genetic crosses. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (18Daum G. Sperka-Gottlieb C.D. Hermetter A. Paltauf F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 946: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For mitochondrial RNA analysis yeast were grown in YPD medium (2% bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract Difco) with 2% glucose, and for degradosome purification in YPD medium containing 2% glycerol and 1% ethanol. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a Hybond-C membrane. Proteins were detected with the following antibodies: tandem affinity purification method (TAP)1 tag, peroxidase-antiperoxidase (Sigma), NAM9 (19Chacinska A. Boguta M. Krzewska J. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and visualized using ECL from Amersham Biosciences. Total native extracts were prepared as described previously (4Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For preparation of native mitochondrial extracts mitochondria isolated from 2.5 liters of yeast culture were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) incubated with rotation for 15 min in 4 °C, centrifuged 20,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. The TAP purification procedure was performed exactly as described (17Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar) with the exception that 5 ml of mitochondrial extract was mixed with 5 ml of IPP150 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and directly loaded on a IgG affinity column without dialysis. For SDS-PAGE, proteins were precipitated by tricholoroacetic acid. For biochemical analysis, protein complexes were dialyzed to buffer containing 50% glycerol 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were identified by the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences. In-gel digestion of the protein was performed by the protocol of Shevchenko et al. (20Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar), using bovine trypsin (Promega). Q-Time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass) was used for peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequencing by tandem mass spectrometry. The Suv3 protein was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting with peptide coverage of 18% protein. Dss1p and ribosomal proteins were identified by peptide sequencing. Sequenced peptides were for: Dss1p (VELDHTR, QYLTVTSPLR, LINSDFQLITK, NSNAVIFGEGFNK, DISALYPSVIQLLK, ELDNDQATETVVDR, LYDLTNIEELQWK); Mrpl3p (FLPESELAK, STVNEIPESVASK, LQLPNELTYSTLSR, MEPFEFTLGR, FFNNSLNSK, SIIAAIWAVTEQK, SPVFIVHVFSGEETLGEGYGSSLK); Mrpl40p (GQPDLIIPWPKPDPIIIPWPKPDPIDVQTNLATDPVIAREQTFWVDSVVR, VFEFLEK); Mrp1p (GLFSIEGLQK, EVSYIPLLAIDASPK); and Mrpl35p (YSPPEHIDEIFRMSYDFLEQR, DIIDYDVPVYR, LETLAAIPDTLPTLVPR, FVVWVFR). Mitochondrial ribosomes were isolated by centrifugation through sucrose cushion as described previously (19Chacinska A. Boguta M. Krzewska J. Rospert S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7220-7229Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). NTP-dependent exoribonuclease activity was analyzed as described previously (4Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). RNA helicase activity was assayed by the strand displacement method. The partially double-stranded RNA substrate was prepared as described in Ref. 21Gallinari P. Brennan D. Nardi C. Brunetti M. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6758-6769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar with the exception that substrates after annealing were purified by 15% native acrylamide gel electrophoresis. The RNA helicase activity assay was performed in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CTP, and 100 fmol of 32P-labeled partial duplex RNA substrate at 30 °C. In a time course aliquots (5 μl) were analyzed on a native 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and 0.1% SDS. Strand separation was visualized by autoradiography. RNA was isolated from mitochondria by the guanidinium thiocyanate-acid phenol procedure using TriReagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH). RNA was normalized with respect to the amount of COX1 mRNA assayed by Northern blot. For Northern blot analysis RNA was resolved in 1% agarose gels containing 0.925% formaldehyde, and 1× NBC buffer (0.5 m boric acid, 10 mm sodium citrate, 50 mm NaOH), transferred to nylon membranes by passive diffusion or resolved in 6% denaturing acrylamide gels and transferred to nylon membranes by electrophoretic transfer in 0.5 TBE buffer in a trans-blot cell apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blots were washed 2 times with 2× SSC. RNA was immobilized by UV cross-linking and incubation at 80 °C in vacuum, hybridized at 55 °C for oligonucleotide probes or at 65 °C for DNA fragment probes in: 7% SDS, 0.5 m Na3PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin buffer. Oligonucleotides used for hybridization were as follows: COBmRNA (TATCTATGTATTAATTTAATTATATATTATTTATTAACTCTACCGAT),COB 3′-precursor (TATTATTATTATTTAATTTTTATAAATTAGAGATAT),VAR1 mRNA (AAATATAATAGAAAAAAGAGTATTATATATTAATATAAAATATATTAATAT), VAR1precursor (GAAGGAGTTTGGTTAAAGAAGATAAAGAATAAAA), 15 S rRNA (TATAAGCCCACCGCAGGTTCCCCTACGGTAACTGTA), and 15 S rRNA 3′-precursor (ATATAATATTAATATTTATATTAATATTTAGATTAATATTTA). Probes for tRNA detection were the products of PCR using radiolabeled [32P]dATP. One of the primers was biotinylated and strands were resolved on streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynal) using NaOH as for solid phase nuclease S1 mapping. For tRNA Val and Thr, primers were: Valth P (AAATAAATATTATTATATTAAGATAG) and Valth L + 5′-biotin (AATAATATTATAATAAATTTATAAATG) and both strands were used as separate probes. For tRNA, Ala I Ile primers were tRANL1 (TATAATTTTATATTTTAATATAGG) and TRNAP + 5′-biotin (GAAACTAACAGGGATTGAACC) and as a probe was used for the strand containing biotin. 3′-Ends of COX1 andCOB mRNAs were mapped by the classical S1 mapping method using single-stranded probes (22Berk A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 180: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). 3′-Ends for 21 S rRNA and 15 S rRNA were mapped by solid phase S1 nuclease mapping (23Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 294: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). ForCOX1 mRNA, the DNA fragment excised byEcoRI and BstYI restriction enzymes from the pUCCOX1 plasmid containing the 3′-end of the COX1 gene labeled at the 3′-end with [32P]dATP using the Klenow fragment (Fermentas) was used as a probe. Single-stranded RNA was purified by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pUCCOX1 was constructed by cloning the PCR product obtained using primers, MWG1 (TAAAATGGAACTAAT), MWG2 (TGTGGCTTCCCAATGCATTTCTTAGG), and mitochondrial DNA as a template, digested with NsiI and BstYI into pUC18 vector digested with NsiI andBamHI. For COB mRNA, the DNA fragment excised byCsp6I and BamHI restriction enzymes from pUCCOB plasmid containing the 3′-end of COB, labeled at the 3′-end with [32P]dATP using Klenow fragment (Fermentas) was used as a probe. Single-stranded DNA was purified by denaturing acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Plasmid pUCCOB was constructed by cloning of the PCR product obtained using the primers: MWG23 (CGGGATCCTAGGACAAATTGGAGGTGCC), MWG 24 (CGGAATCAAATCTCCTTGCGGGGTCC), and the template of mitochondrial DNA and digested withEcoRI and BstYI into pUC18 vector digested withEcoRI and BamHI. For 15 S rRNA, the PCR product obtained using primers 15SL (acaggcgttacattgttgtc) and 15SP (CCCTTATTTATTTAAAGAAGATG) digested with Sau3A restricton enzyme was used as a probe. For 21 S rRNA, the PCR product obtained using primers 21SNL2 (AGTACGCAAGGACCATAATG) and 21SR2 (TTTCGATTACAAAACGAATGC) digested with the NcoI restriction enzyme was used as a probe. 5 μg of mitochondrial RNA were hybridized with 2 pm [γ-32P]ATP-labeled primer in 200 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.3. The reaction mixture was heated at 85 °C for 5 min and slowly cooled to 42 °C and then 10 μl of elongation mixture was added (2× buffer for avian myeloblastosis virus, dNTP 2 mm, 7 units of avian myeloblastosis virus (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Reactions were stopped by addition of 12 μl of formamide and products were resolved in 6% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Accompanying sequencing reactions were used as molecular weight markers. Primers were used as follows: COX1 (TATATTTAATGATATTAATACTCTC),VAR1 (GAAATATATATATATATATAATATGCATCC), COB(CAATTATTATTATTATTATTATACATAAA), 15 S rRNA (CGTATGACTCGTATGCGTCATGTCC), 21 S rRNA (TTTAATTATTATACTCCATGTTATCT), COX3(ATTAATATAAATCATTGATAATATCTT), and ATP6/8(ATATTAGTATTTATTTATATAGTTCCC). The procedure was very similar to that described previously (24Hofmann T.J. Min J. Zassenhaus H.P. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 5 μg of mitochondrial RNA were hybridized to 1 pm oligonucleotide CobT1 (TATCTATGTATTAATTTAATTATATATTATTTATTAACTCTACCGAT) in 20 μl by heating at 65 °C for 5 min, and slow renaturation to 37 °C (90–120 min). Heteroduplexes were ethanol precipitated, resuspended in 5 μl of digestion buffer (20 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.0, 10 mm EDTA, 5 units of RNase T1 (Invitrogen)), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 5 μl of formamide were added to the samples. The samples were heated at 75 °C for 3 min and resolved in 8% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel, transferred to nylon membrane by electrophoresis transfer in 0.5 TBE buffer in a trans-blot cell (Bio-Rad) and hybridized using32P-end labeled CobT1 oligonucleotide. The accompanying DNA sequencing reactions were used as molecular weight markers. To determine the structure and in vitro activity of the degradosome we decided to purify this protein complex by the TAP method (17Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In our previous work (4Dziembowski A. Stepien P.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) we constructed a yeast strain with C-terminal Suv3 TAP tag fusion (named SUVTAP). In addition, for the purpose of this study we constructed a C-terminal Dss1p TAP tag fusion strain (DSSTAP). Western blot analysis of total native yeast extracts using anti-TAP antibodies revealed that in such conditions Dss1p always partially degrades (Fig. 1). Therefore we developed a method of degradosome isolation from purified mitochondria that minimizes protein degradation. In such conditions, using either Suv3-TAP fusion or Dss1-TAP fusion the purified degradosomes were active as a NTP-dependent exoribonuclease and contained only 2 large proteins migrating as 75 and 105 kDa that we assumed to be the Suv3p and Dss1p proteins (Fig. 2 B). The two proteins were excised from the gel and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. As expected they represented SUV3and DSS1 gene products. This result correlates with the predicted molecular masses of the Suv3p (81 kDa) and Dss1p (108 kDa). The differences in gel migration of Suv3p and Dss1p in purifications from strains DSSTAP and SUVTAP were because of the rest of the TAP tag in Dss1p and Suv3p proteins, respectively. There was no 90-kDa protein, which was previously believed to correspond to Suv3p (12Margossian S.P., Li, H. Zassenhaus H.P. Butow R.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 199-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of protein samples from mock TAP purification shows no proteins, confirming specificity of purification (Fig. 2 B). On the basis of these results we suggest that the degradosome contains only two large subunits: Suv3p and Dss1p.Figure 2The degradosome is composed of Suv3 and Dss1 proteins. The degradosome was purified from TAP-tagged yeast strains DSSTAP and SUVTAP and from wild-type strain W303 as a control. After purification all eluted fractions were pooled and divided into equal portions. The first portion was dialyzed against the appropriate buffer and assayed for exoribonuclease activity. The other was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE.A, NTP-exoribonuclease activity assay. Protein samples were incubated with internally (32P-labeled) UTP-labeled RNA with and without NTPs and subjected to polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC under conditions in which the substrate (RNA) remains at the bottom of the chromatogram and reaction products (UMP) migrate with the front.B, SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified degradosome using silver staining. Proteins identified by mass spectrometry are indicated by arrows. Molecular weight markers are indicated on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to Suv3p and Dss1p, the TAP-purified degradosome preparations contained smaller proteins. Their concentrations changed slightly from purification to purification (data not shown). On the basis of mass spectrometry analysis we identified three proteins from the large ribosomal subunit (Mrpl3p, Mrpl40p, and Mrpl35p) and one protein from the small subunit (Mrp1p). This suggested the association of the degradosome complexes with ribosomes. Therefore, we purified mitochondrial ribosomes by centrifugation through a sucrose cushion and analyzed the presence of the degradosome subunit Dss1p and ribosomal proteins by immunoblotting analysis using antibodies specific for TAP tag and the ribosomal protein Nam9p (Fig. 3). Our analyses indicated that the Dss1p protein was present exclusively in the ribosomal fraction, suggesting that in vivo all degradosome particles are associated with ribosomes. RNA-dependent NTPase activity of the degradosome and homology of Suv3 protein to known RNA helicases suggested that the degradosome has RNA helicase activity, but so far no biochemical data had been reported. Our attempts to isolate Suv3p and Dss1p in a variety of heterologous expression systems failed, therefore we performed an RNA helicase assay by a strand displacement method using the degradosome purified from the DSSTAP strain (Fig. 4). As can be seen in Fig. 4 the degradosome has the ability to unwind double-stranded RNA regions; this results in formation of single-stranded RNA that was subsequently degraded exoribonucleolytically. There was no partial degradation of the substrate before unwinding, so RNA helicase activity precedes exoribonuclease activity of this complex. This result is in agreement with the previously reported absolute requirement for nucleotide triphosphates for RNA degradation by MtEXO (11Min J.J. Zassenhaus H.P. SAAS Bull. Biochem. Biotechnol. 1991; 4: 1-5PubMed Google Scholar). RNase activity of the degradosome seems to be associated with the Dss1 protein that has regions of homology to bacterial RNase II. To understand the role of the Dss1p in degradosome functions we constructed the yeast strain DSSSER containing a point mutation within the DSS1 coding sequence and a TAP tag at the C terminus of the protein. The tyrosine 814 residue was changed to serine. This tyrosine is conserved in the exoribonuclease family to which Dss1p belongs and it may be involved in the catalytic mechanism (25Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The constructed strain appeared to be respiratory incompetent with very unstable mitochondrial genomes (data not shown). This indicates that this amino acid is essential for Dss1p function and mitochondrial biogenesis. We have tried to purify the mitochondrial degradosome from the mutant strain and from a nonrespiring strain DSSTAP rho0 as a control, but Western blot analysis revealed that Dss1p is unstable in mitochondrial extracts from respiratory incompetent strains (data not shown). To avoid this problem we constructed respiring diploid strains W303/DSSSER and W303/DSSTAP (wild type Dss1p) as a control. TAP-purified degradosomes were assayed for NTP-dependent exoribonuclease and RNA helicase activity. Results presented in Fig. 5 show that the mutation Y814S of the Dss1p causes complete loss of the exoribonuclease activity of the degradosome but does not abolish RNA helicase activity. These results show that Dss1p is responsible for exoribonuclease activity of the degradosome and that it is essential for proper mitochondrial biogenesis. Our previous results have shown that a disruption of SUV3 orDSS1 genes results in alterations in RNA stability and processing in mitochondria in a system where intronless mitochondrial genomes were introduced into mutant strains (13Dziembowski A. Malewicz M. Mı́nczuk M. Golik P. Dmochowska A. Stepien P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 15 S rRNA andCOB mRNAs were unstable, in addition in the mutants we detected several precursors of 21 S rRNA and VAR1, which were not visible on Northern blots prepared from the wild-type strains. We decided to look more carefully at mitochondrial RNA processing in ΔSUV3 and ΔDSS1 strains with intronless mtDNA. We analyzed the processing of 3′-ends of 21 S rRNA, 15 S rRNA, and mRNA for COB and COX1 by S1 nuclease mapping (Fig. 6 A). Our results show that the mature form of RNA is produced for all RNA classes tested. Processing of 21 S rRNA is strongly inhibited and the precursor accumulates. In the case of 15 S rRNA, and mRNA for COX1and COB precursor molecules were not seen because they were longer than the probes used for S1 nuclease mapping. Therefore we analyzed 3′-end processing of 15 S rRNA, COB mRNA, andVAR1 mRNA by Northern blot hybridizations using two oligonucleotide probes: one complementary to the 3′-end of mature RNA and the other complementary to the region adjacent to the precursor (Fig. 6 B). For all RNAs tested the accumulation of precursors not processed at the 3′-end was observed. On autoradiograms of Northern blots with precursor-specific probes it was impossible to detect any new RNA classes not seen on Northern blots with mRN"

https://openalex.org/W1630725966,"In the absence of a corrosive environment, brittle materials such as silicon should be immune to cyclic fatigue. However, fatigue effects are well known in micrometer-sized polycrystalline silicon (polysilicon) samples tested in air. To investigate the origins of this phenomenon in polysilicon, we developed a fixed-grip fracture mechanics microspecimen but could find no evidence of static stress corrosion cracking. The environmental sensitivity of the fatigue resistance was also investigated under cyclic loading. For low-cycle fatigue, the behavior is independent of the ambient conditions, whether air or vacuum, but is strongly influenced by the ratio of compressive to tensile stresses experienced during each cycle. The fatigue damage most likely originates from contact stresses at processing-related surface asperities; subcritical crack growth then ensues during further cyclic loading. The lower far-field stresses involved in high-cycle fatigue induce reduced levels of fatigue damage. Under these conditions, a corrosive ambient such as laboratory air exacerbates the fatigue process. Without cyclic loading, polysilicon does not undergo stress corrosion cracking."
https://openalex.org/W2150102277,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and vitronectin activate cell-signaling pathways by binding to the uPA receptor (uPAR). Because uPAR is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, the signaling receptor is most likely a uPAR-containing multiprotein complex. This complex may be heterogeneous within a single cell and among different cell types. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the EGF receptor (EGFR) as a component of the uPAR-signaling machinery. uPA activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in COS-7 cells and in COS-7 cells that overexpress uPAR, and this response was blocked by the EGFR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, implicating the EGFR in the pathway that links uPAR to ERK. By contrast, Rac1 activation, which occurred as a result of uPAR overexpression, was EGFR-independent. COS-7 cell migration was stimulated, in an additive manner, by uPAR-dependent pathways leading to ERK and Rac1. AG1478 inhibited only the ERK-dependent component of the response. CHO-K1 cells do not express EGFR; however, these cells demonstrated ERK activation in response to uPA, indicating the presence of an EGFR-independent alternative pathway. As anticipated, this response was insensitive to AG1478. When CHO-K1 cells were transfected to express EGFR or a kinase-inactive mutant of EGFR, ERK activation in response to uPA was unchanged; however, the EGFR-expressing cells acquired sensitivity to AG1478. We conclude that the EGFR may function as a transducer of the signal from uPAR to ERK, but not Rac1. In the absence of EGFR, an alternative pathway links uPAR to ERK; however, this pathway is apparently silenced by EGFR expression. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and vitronectin activate cell-signaling pathways by binding to the uPA receptor (uPAR). Because uPAR is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored, the signaling receptor is most likely a uPAR-containing multiprotein complex. This complex may be heterogeneous within a single cell and among different cell types. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the EGF receptor (EGFR) as a component of the uPAR-signaling machinery. uPA activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in COS-7 cells and in COS-7 cells that overexpress uPAR, and this response was blocked by the EGFR inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478, implicating the EGFR in the pathway that links uPAR to ERK. By contrast, Rac1 activation, which occurred as a result of uPAR overexpression, was EGFR-independent. COS-7 cell migration was stimulated, in an additive manner, by uPAR-dependent pathways leading to ERK and Rac1. AG1478 inhibited only the ERK-dependent component of the response. CHO-K1 cells do not express EGFR; however, these cells demonstrated ERK activation in response to uPA, indicating the presence of an EGFR-independent alternative pathway. As anticipated, this response was insensitive to AG1478. When CHO-K1 cells were transfected to express EGFR or a kinase-inactive mutant of EGFR, ERK activation in response to uPA was unchanged; however, the EGFR-expressing cells acquired sensitivity to AG1478. We conclude that the EGFR may function as a transducer of the signal from uPAR to ERK, but not Rac1. In the absence of EGFR, an alternative pathway links uPAR to ERK; however, this pathway is apparently silenced by EGFR expression. urokinase-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase epidermal growth factor receptor epidermal growth factor diisopropyl phospho green fluorescent protein fetal bovine serum uPAR-overexpressing COS-7 cells kinase-inactive bovine serum albumin p21-activated kinase Binding of the serine proteinase, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA),1 to its cell surface receptor, uPAR, promotes plasminogen activation at the cell surface and may lead to the activation of metalloproteinases (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar). Because uPAR localizes to the leading edge of migrating cells, activated proteinases generated downstream of uPA and uPAR may degrade extracellular matrix proteins, facilitating cell migration through tissue (2Gyetko M.R.

Indeed, uPA and/or uPAR have been implicated in physiologic processes requiring cell migration, including inflammation, scar formation, revascularization of injured tissues, neointima formation, and cancer metastasis (1Andreasen P.A.

In addition to uPA, uPAR binds directly to the extracellular matrix protein, vitronectin (12Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

The binding sites for uPA and vitronectin, in the structure of uPAR, are distinct but interactive because uPA-binding increases the affinity of uPAR for vitronectin (14Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J.

Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). When uPA or vitronectin bind to uPAR, cell-signaling responses are elicited. Vitronectin-binding activates a pathway that includes the small GTPase, Rac1, and may drive new actin polymerization in the migrating cell (16Kjoller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). uPA-binding activates diverse signaling pathways, and the nature of the response may be cell type-specific (17Ossowski L.

In multiple cells, binding of uPA to uPAR activates the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (19Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because myosin light chain kinase is activated downstream of ERK, this signaling pathway also may stimulate cell migration (20Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). uPAR is linked to the plasma membrane only by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and thus lacks transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains (23Ploug M. Ronne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, it is generally assumed that the complete uPAR-signaling receptor is a multiprotein complex. In support of this hypothesis, soluble uPAR binds to the cell surface and elicits many of the same responses as uPA (24Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F.

The true function of uPA may be to alter the conformation of uPAR, promoting interactions with other proteins in the plasma membrane that are required for cell-signaling (27Blasi F. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A question of considerable importance concerns the nature of the uPAR-containing multiprotein complex involved in cell-signaling. uPAR associates with β1, β2, β3, and β5 integrins (15Wei Y.

In some cell types, caveolin may promote association of uPAR with β1integrin, and this may be necessary for cell signaling (33Wei Y. Yang X. Liu Q. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The transmembrane protein, gp130, associates with uPAR and serves as a critical adaptor protein leading to activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (34Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28563-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The G protein-coupled receptor, FPR-like receptor-1/lipoxin A4 receptor (FPRL1/LXA4R), binds soluble uPAR, mediates uPAR-initiated chemotaxis in monocytes, and is necessary for signaling to the tyrosine kinase, Hck (35Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Finally, Liu et al. (36Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) identified a complex that includes uPAR, α5β1, and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mainly in cells that express high levels of uPAR. After uPA stimulation, focal adhesion kinase operated downstream of α5β1 to activate the EGFR, and this was necessary for signaling to ERK. Specific antagonists of EGFR completely blocked ERK phosphorylation. Thus, it was proposed that EGFR serves as a critical adaptor protein in the pathway that links uPAR to ERK. The EGFR also may be transactivated by G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor β receptor (37Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 38Prenzel N. Zwick E. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The diversity of adaptor proteins, which associate with uPAR and promote uPAR signaling, suggests that the uPAR-multiprotein signaling complex may be large and heterogeneous. Components of the uPAR signaling complex may be affected by multiple properties of the cell, including membrane protein expression. We are particularly interested in signaling pathways leading to activation of Rac1 and ERK, because these pathways play pivotal roles in cell migration. In this study, we demonstrate that the EGFR is indeed essential in the pathway that links uPAR to ERK in cells that express EGFR. However, in cells that lack EGFR, alternative EGFR-independent pathways are operational, and uPA is still able to activate ERK. uPAR-dependent Rac1 activation is EGR-independent. Two-chain uPA was kindly provided by Drs. Jack Henkin and Andrew Mazar, previously of Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). uPA was treated with diisopropyl fluorophosphate to generate DIP-uPA, as previously described (19Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). DIP-uPA binds to uPAR with unchanged affinity but lacks proteinase activity. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD098059, was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Expression constructs encoding human uPAR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were previously described (20Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The expression construct, which encodes dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1), was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Nakamoto (University of Virginia). Constructs encoding wild-type full-length EGFR and kinase-inactive EGFR (KI-EGFR) were kindly provided by Dr. Sarah Parsons (University of Virginia). In KI-EGFR, mutation at residue 721 (Lys→Ala) abolishes kinase activity (39Chen W.S. Lazar C.S. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. Gill G.N. Rosenfeld M.G.

Rac/Cdc42 assay reagent (PAK-PBD1), which includes residues 67–150 of p21-activated kinase (PAK-1) fused to glutathione-S-transferase and coupled to glutathione-agarose was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibody that specifically detects phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal antibody that recognizes total ERK1 and ERK2 was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.(San Francisco, CA). Rac1-specific monoclonal antibody was from BD Biosciences. Polyclonal anti-human uPAR antibody was from American Diagnostica. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies specific for mouse IgG and rabbit IgG were from Amersham Biosciences. Tyrphostin AG1478, protease inhibitor mixture, sodium orthovanadate, dithiothreitol, G418, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm). Cells were passaged using Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and maintained in culture for 48 h before performing experiments. COS-7 cells were transfected to overexpress human uPAR by incubation for 48 h with 2 μg of the uPAR expression construct in the presence of EffecteneTM (Qiagen). uPAR expression was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis. An equivalent protocol was used to transfect CHO-K1 cells to express wild-type EGFR or KI-EGFR. Cultures were selected in G418 (1 mg/ml) for 30 days and then maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5 mg/ml G418. Migration of COS-7 and uPAR-overexpressing COS-7 cells (COS-7/uPAR) was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores (Costar), as previously described (19Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The Transwell membranes were precoated with 20% FBS on the underside only. Both membrane surfaces were then blocked with 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells (105in 100 μl) in serum-free medium were pretreated with tyrphostin AG1478 (50 nm) or PD098059 (50 μm) for 15 min in suspension and then with DIP-uPA or EGF for an additional 15 min. The cells were then added to the upper chamber of each Transwell unit in the presence of the same agents. The lower chamber was supplemented with DIP-uPA or EGF when these agents were added to the top chamber. Migration was allowed to occur for 6 h at 37 °C. Cell migration was determined by crystal violet staining, as previously described (20Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In some experiments, COS-7 and COS-7/uPAR cells were transiently co-transfected with the constructs encoding N17Rac1 (2 μg) and with pEGFP (0.5 μg), which encodes GFP, by incubation with EffecteneTM (Qiagen) for 24 h. Co-transfection efficiencies were essentially 100%, when determined as previously described (20Nguyen D.H. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Migration experiments were performed using Biocoat cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences) instead of Transwell chambers. The membrane-coating method and protocol for pretreating cells was unchanged. Cell migration was determined by counting green-fluorescing cells. COS-7 cells, COS-7/uPAR cells, CHO-K1 cells, and EGFR-overexpressing CHO-K1 cells were cultured on 60-mm plates until 80–90% confluent and then were serum-starved for 24 h. When indicated, the cells were preincubated with tyrphostin AG1478 (50 nm) for 2 h. DIP-uPA (10 nm) was then added for 10 min. Cell extracts were prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitor mixture and sodium orthovanadate (1 mm). The protein concentration in each extract was determined by bicinchoninic acid assay. Equal amounts of each extract were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% slabs, electrotransferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membranes, and probed with specific antibodies for phosphorylated and total ERK. Affinity precipitation of active Rac1 was performed using the fusion protein, PAK1-PBD, which specifically recognizes the active GTP-bound forms of Rac1 and Cdc42, as previously described (16Kjoller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 41Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). COS-7 and COS-7/uPAR cells (2 × 105) were cultured in 10-cm plates for 18 h. Some cultures were pretreated with tyrphostin AG1478 (50 nm) for 2 h. Cultures then were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate. The extracts were incubated with 15 μg of PAK1-PBD coupled to glutathione-Sepharose for 45 min at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose was washed four times and then treated with SDS-sample buffer to dissociate the PAK1-PBD and associated proteins. Immunoblot analysis was performed to detect active Rac1. Samples of each cell extract were also subjected to immunoblot analysis before incubation with PAK1-PBD to determine total Rac1. In this study, COS-7 cells, which express EGFR (42Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), were transfected to overexpress uPAR. As shown in Fig. 1 A, low levels of uPAR were detected in the parental cells; however, the transfected cells (COS-7/uPAR) expressed high levels of uPAR. When treated with EGF (10 ng/ml), COS-7 and COS-7/uPAR cells demonstrated significant ERK activation, as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 B), confirming that these cells express EGFR. Both cell types also responded to DIP-uPA (10 nm) and demonstrated ERK activation within 10 min. The major difference observed between the COS-7 and COS-7/uPAR cells was an increase in the basal level of activated ERK (in the absence of exogenously added agents) in the COS-7/uPAR cells. This may reflect autocrine uPAR activation by endogenously produced uPA, as has been previously described (43Ma Z. Webb D.J., Jo, M. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3387-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of uPA to activate ERK in parental COS-7 cells was not surprising, despite the low level of uPAR, because uPA activates ERK in MCF-7 cells, which express only 3,000–4,000 copies of cell-surface uPAR/cell (19Nguyen D.H. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To determine the role of the EGFR in uPA-stimulated ERK activation, we pretreated COS-7 and COS-7/uPAR cells with the EGFR-specific inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (50 nm). This drug completely blocked ERK activation in response to DIP-uPA in both cell types (Fig. 1 C). A slight decrease in the basal level of activated ERK was also observed. These results suggest that the EGFR plays an essential role in the pathway by which uPA activates ERK in COS-7 cells and that the level of uPAR expression is not critical in determining whether the EGFR participates in this signaling event. Kjoller et al. (16Kjoller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) demonstrated that uPAR overexpression is associated with an increase in Rac1 activation and increased cell migration. This response requires vitronectin binding to uPAR and not uPA. Because of the role of the EGFR in uPA-induced ERK activation in COS-7 cells, we performed experiments to determine whether the EGFR is necessary in the pathway that links uPAR to Rac1. As shown in Fig. 2, GTP-bound Rac1 was increased in the uPAR-overexpressing COS-7 cells (p < 0.05, n = 3), confirming the results of Kjolleret al. (16Kjoller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Tyrphostin AG1478 had no effect on the level of GTP-Rac1 in COS-7 or COS-7/uPAR cells. These results suggest that the adaptor protein interactions, which facilitate uPAR signaling either to ERK or Rac1, are distinct. uPAR overexpression was associated with a modest but significant increase (p < 0.01, n = 9) in COS-7 cell migration through serum-coated Transwell membranes (Fig. 3 A). In the absence of uPA, tyrphostin AG1478 had no effect on the migration rate of COS-7/uPAR cells. uPA further stimulated the migration of COS-7/uPAR cells (1.9-fold; p < 0.01, n = 5), and this response was blocked by tyrphostin AG1478. Tyrphostin AG1478 also blocked the effects of EGF on COS-7/uPAR cell migration, as anticipated. We hypothesized that uPAR overexpression promotes cell migration by its effects on Rac1 activation, which is independent of EGFR, and that uPA and EGF stimulate cell migration by their effects on ERK activation, which is EGFR-dependent. To test this hypothesis, we examined COS-7/uPAR cell migration after treatment with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor, PD098053 (50 μm). As shown in Fig. 3 B, PD098059 blocked the effects of uPA on COS-7/uPAR cell migration without affecting the basal level of migration of these cells. To examine the role of Rac1, we transfected COS-7/uPAR cells to express dominant-negative Rac1 (N17Rac1). The cells were co-transfected with pEGFP, so that migration of N17Rac1-expressing cells could be determined by counting fluorescent cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, N17Rac1 neutralized the increase in cell migration that was associated with uPAR overexpression in COS-7/uPAR cells, consistent with our model. uPA failed to stimulate migration of N17Rac1-expressing cells, suggesting that ERK activation may not promote cell migration when the constitutive activity of Rac1 is neutralized. A similar relationship was recently defined, regarding ERK and RhoA in uPA-stimulated MCF-7 cell migration (44Jo M. Thomas K.S. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12479-12485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells express cell-surface uPAR but not EGFR (45Bringman T.S. Lindquist P.B. Derynck R.

CHO-K1 cells were transfected to express wild-type EGFR or a kinase-inactive mutant of the EGFR. Expression was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (results not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 A, EGF did not stimulate ERK activation in the parental cells, as anticipated because of the lack of EGFR. Cells that were transfected to express KI-EGFR also failed to respond to EGF. By contrast, CHO-K1 cells that expressed wild-type EGFR demonstrated significant ERK phosphorylation in response to EGF. DIP-uPA stimulated ERK activation in the parental CHO-K1 cells, despite the lack of EGFR (Fig. 4 B). Thus, we hypothesized that these cells use an EGFR-independent pathway to couple uPAR to ERK. To rule out the possibility that trace levels of EGFR are responsible for the activation of ERK in uPA-treated CHO-K1 cells, we pretreated these cells with tyrphostin AG1478; however, the EGFR kinase antagonist was without effect. DIP-uPA promoted ERK activation equally well in cells that were transfected to express wild-type EGFR or KI-EGFR (Fig. 4 C). Tyrphostin AG1478 inhibited ERK activation in response to uPA only in the cells that express wild-type EGFR. Thus, whereas CHO-K1 cells apparently have an alternative EGFR-independent pathway to couple uPAR to ERK, this pathway is not operational when EGFR is expressed. uPA-binding to uPAR activates multiple cell-signaling proteins and systems, including focal adhesion kinase, ERK, protein kinase Cε, the Src-family tyronine kinase Hck, and the JAK/STAT pathway (17Ossowski L. Aguirre-Ghiso J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 18Kjoller L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Vitronectin binding to uPAR activates Rac1 (16Kjoller L. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1145-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Various adaptor proteins that associate with uPAR in the plasma membrane have been implicated as transducers of uPAR-signaling across the plasma membrane. FPRL1/LXA4R has been implicated in signaling to Hck (35Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), gp130 in signaling to JAK1 (34Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28563-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and EGFR in signaling to ERK (36Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). An important question that arises is whether these adaptor proteins are truly compartmentalized in function, transmitting uPAR signals to some signaling pathways but not to others. In this case, how a cell responds to uPA may be determined by the composition of the uPAR-signaling receptor complex. Furthermore, the composition of the uPAR-signaling receptor complex may be dynamic and thus altered by changes in membrane protein expression or catabolism. In this study, our goal was to elucidate the function of the EGFR in uPAR-initiated cell signaling. Our results provide evidence for compartmentalized function of uPAR-associated adaptor proteins in cell signaling. In a single cell type (COS-7), the EGFR was essential for transmitting uPAR signals to ERK but not Rac1. The branch point remains to be determined. In epidermoid carcinoma cells, EGFR was activated downstream of uPAR-integrin complex and focal adhesion kinase; however, EGFR was recovered in complex with uPAR and α5β1, so these reactions probably occurred within the context of a single multicomponent complex (36Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Rac1 activation may occur downstream of tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors and require the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or p130Cas (46Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 47Timokhina I. Kissel H. Stella G. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6250-6262Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 48Ma A.D.

Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 725-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Rac1 is also activated downstream of integrins (50Bialkowska K. Kulkarni S., Du, X. Goll D.E. Saido T.C. Fox J.E. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the integrin-uPAR complex may signal directly to Rac1. In CHO-K1 cells, EGFR is not expressed (45Bringman T.S. Lindquist P.B. Derynck R. Cell. 1987; 48: 429-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that EGF does not activate ERK in CHO-K1 cells, as anticipated because of the lack of receptor; however, uPA did activate ERK. Thus, an EGFR-independent pathway exists for transmitting signals from uPAR to ERK in CHO-K1 cells and possibly in other cells as well. In MCF-7 cells, focal adhesion kinase, c-Src and Shc function upstream of Ras in the pathway that couples uPAR to ERK (26Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J. Catling A.D. Song Q. Dhakephalkar A. Weber M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19382-19388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These same factors may directly couple integrins to ERK, without the EGFR as a necessary intermediate (51Howe A.K. Aplin A.E. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 52Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Thus, uPAR and integrins may form an adequate signaling complex to activate the Ras-ERK pathway in the absence of EGFR. It is also possible that when EGFR is not expressed, an alternative adaptor protein associates with the uPAR multiprotein signaling-receptor complex. This alternative adaptor protein could be another member of the EGF receptor family or an unrelated membrane protein. In this regard, tyrphostin AG1478 is specific for EGFR (53Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar). An interesting and potentially important observation concerns the effects of EGFR expression on the response of CHO-K1 cells to uPA. An obvious change in the magnitude or kinetics of ERK activation in response to DIP-uPA was not observed; however, the response became sensitive to tyrphostin AG1478. This result suggests that when EGFR is expressed, it associates with uPAR in the plasma membrane and assumes a dominant role in the uPA-dependent signaling complex that activates ERK. The inability of uPA to activate ERK, in EGFR-expressing CHO-K1 cells, when these cells are pretreated with tyrphostin AG1478, suggests that EGFR silences the alternative pathway. One explanation for these data is that EGFR displaces an alternative adaptor protein from the uPAR signaling receptor complex; however, if this model is correct, we would expect KI-EGFR to inhibit uPAR-signaling to ERK, which was not observed. The inability of KI-EGFR to silence the alternative pathway may reflect conformational variation in the mutant receptor so that it does not associate with uPAR, or possibly insufficient expression in our experiments. From these studies, we propose that cell signaling initiated from the uPAR-containing multiprotein complex is compartmentalized. By this we mean that different proteins that are associated with uPAR may be responsible for triggering different signaling pathways. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the uPAR signaling-receptor complex is dynamic. When a protein like EGFR is expressed in cells, it may enter the complex and alter its properties. This model provides an explanation for the diversity of adaptor proteins shown by others to facilitate uPAR signaling. This model also provides a possible explanation for differences in signaling responses observed in different cell types. In processes such as breast cancer, the EGFR and uPAR are both important determinants of disease progression. Biochemical and functional interactions between these two receptors, described here and elsewhere (36Liu D. Aguirre Ghiso J. Estrada Y. Ossowski L. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 445-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), raise the possibility that extensive cross-talk may occur in cancer cells. Understanding this cross-talk is an important goal for the future."

Disease prevention requires pathogen recognition and the induction of a multifaceted defense response. We are studying the non-host disease resistance response of parsley to the oomycete, Phytophthora sojae using a cell culture-based system. Receptor-mediated recognition of P. sojae may be achieved through a thirteen amino acid peptide sequence (Pep-13) present within an abundant cell wall transglutaminase. Following recognition of this elicitor molecule, parsley cells mount a defense response, which includes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcriptional activation of genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins or enzymes involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins. Treatment of parsley cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), blocked both Pep-13-induced phytoalexin production and the accumulation of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in their synthesis. In contrast, DPI treatment had no effect upon Pep-13-induced PRgene expression, suggesting the existence of an oxidative burst-independent mechanism for the transcriptional activation ofPR genes. The use of specific antibodies enabled the identification of three parsley mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that are activated within the signal transduction pathway(s) triggered following recognition of Pep-13. Other environmental challenges failed to activate these kinases in parsley cells, suggesting that their activation plays a key role in defense signal transduction. Moreover, by making use of a protoplast co-transfection system overexpressing wild-type and loss-of-function MAPK mutants, we show an essential role for post-translational phosphorylation and activation of MAPKs for oxidative burst-independentPR promoter activation.

Our previous studies demonstrated the activation of such a homologue, described as ERM kinase, following treatment of parsley cells with the Pep-13 elicitor (16Ligterink W. Kroj T. zur Nieden U. Hirt H. Scheel D. Science. 1997; 276: 2054-2057Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).Evidence indicating the importance of MAPK activation for the elicitation of defense reactions has recently emerged from gain-of-function experiments whereby MAPKs themselves, or constitutively active forms of their upstream activators, MAPK kinases (MAPKKs), were transiently overexpressed in tobacco andArabidopsis leaves (45Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 559-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 46Yang K.-Y. Liu Y. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This resulted in a hypersensitive response-type phenotype in leaves in addition to activation of genes implicated in the biosynthesis of defense-related antimicrobial compounds. These observations have recently been supported by the identification of a complete MAPK cascade fromA. thaliana that is triggered through recognition of flg22 (48Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.-L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). This resulted not only in the accumulation of transcripts of a group of defense-related genes, but also in increased resistance to attack by both fungal and bacterial pathogens (48Asai T. Tena G. Plotnikova J. Willmann M.R. Chiu W.-L. Gomez-Gomez L. Boller T. Ausubel F.M. Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). In addition to these functions in defense, AtMPK6 homologues have been shown to be activated in response to various abiotic stresses including osmotic stresses, ozone exposure, oxidative stress, cold stress, drought, and treatment with salicylic acid (32Droillard M.J.

It has therefore been suggested that members of this class of MAPKs may function as points of cross-talk between various stress signaling pathways in plants (3Nürnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 27Zhang S. Klessig D.F.

Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 392-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).In this article we demonstrate the existence of parallel pathways that operate to induce the transcriptional activation of particular sets of defense-related genes in parsley. One pathway is triggered downstream of the oxidative burst and controls genes implicated in phytoalexin biosynthesis. The second pathway is independent of the oxidative burst, but is dependent on MAPK activity. The MAPKs involved are activated in parsley cells through receptor-mediated recognition of the Pep-13 elicitor and other elicitors of defense reactions, but appear largely insensitive to abiotic stresses, suggesting that their activation is primarily associated with pathogen defense. Furthermore, by utilizing a protoplast transient transfection system employing loss-of-function MAPK mutants, we demonstrate a requirement of MAPK activity for the elicitor-mediated oxidative burst-independent activation ofPR genes, which represent classical markers for pathogen defense responses in plants.DISCUSSIONReceptor-mediated perception of plant pathogens results in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways that function in triggering downstream defense reactions (3Nürnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Scheel D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Defense reactions themselves are characterized by large-scale transcriptional activation of genes, whose products are believed to be actively involved in resisting pathogen attack (20Batz O. Logemann E. Reinold S. Hahlbrock K. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 71Glazebrook J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Our studies have demonstrated that particular signaling pathways are responsible for the transcriptional activation of distinct subsets of defense genes. It is clear that both oxidative burst-dependent and -independent pathways play roles in this response. Previous studies, and those presented here, have demonstrated that the generation of O2⨪, most likely through the activity of an NADPH oxidase homologue(s), is necessary and sufficient to drive the synthesis of antimicrobial phytoalexins in parsley cells (15Jabs T. Tschöpe M. Colling C. Hahlbrock K. Scheel D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4800-4805Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The use in these studies of the NADPH oxidase inhibitor, DPI, to block Pep-13-induced phytoalexin biosynthesis, correlated with its ability to inhibit the transcript accumulation of genes encoding enzymes involved in this process. The transcriptional activation of these genes belongs to the late reactions of elicited parsley cells (18Somssich I.E. Bollmann J. Hahlbrock K. Kombrink E. Schulz W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 12: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Batz O. Logemann E. Reinold S. Hahlbrock K. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, transcript accumulation of genes involved in the immediate early and early reactions (21Eulgem T. Rushton P.J. Schmelzer E. Hahlbrock K. Somssich I.E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 23Rushton P.J. Somssich I.E. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) was unaffected by this treatment suggesting that a separate, albeit parallel, oxidative burst-independent pathway controls the transcriptional activation of such genes.Changes in protein phosphorylation have long been known to occur as a consequence of treatment of plant cells with microbial elicitors (25Dietrich A. Mayer J.E. Hahlbrock K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6360-6368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Felix G. Grosskopf D.G. Regenass M. Boller T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8831-8834Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Among the many protein kinases believed to be involved in these events, members of the MAPK family are becoming increasingly recognized as playing important roles in defense signaling (27Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 28Romeis T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the present study we have shown that in parsley cells at least four different MAPKs are activated in a receptor-dependent manner by the Phytophthora-derived elicitor peptide, Pep-13. Three of these MAPKs could be identified by molecular cloning, immunoprecipitation, and transient transformation assays, and they were found to be homologous to MAPKs implicated in defense signaling in other plant species (3Nürnberger T. Scheel D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 372-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 27Zhang S. Klessig D.F.

Sheen J. Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1954) Google Scholar). The initial in-gel and Western blotting experiments also suggest that at least one elicitor-responsive MAPK remains to be identified. Based upon the activation profile seen for each of the kinases with these methods, and compared with the activities determined through specific immunoprecipitation/kinase assays, this remaining kinase would appear to be activated more transiently than the PcMPK6 and PcMPK3 kinases. Given the lack of any cross-reacting antisera we have as yet been unable to identify this additional activity.The MAPKs we have identified as Pep-13-responsive have homology to those seen to be implicated in elicitor signaling in other systems,i.e. homologues of the AtMPK6 and AtMPK3 MAPKs fromArabidopsis (27Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 520-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In addition, we isolated a parsley homologue of AtMPK4, a MAPK shown to be a negative regulator of disease-resistance responses in Arabidopsis (40Petersen M. Brodersen P. Naested H. Andreasson E. Lindhart U. Johansen B. Nielsen H.B. Lacy M. Austin M.J. Parker J.E. Sharma S.B. Klessig D.F. Martienssen R. Mattson O. Jensen A.B. Mundy J. Cell. 2000; 103: 1111-1120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). This MAPK was not responsive to elicitors (Pep-13 or HrpZ) in parsley cells, and we cannot say whether it is functionally homologous to theArabidopsis MAP kinase 4, which was previously described as being activated in response to Harpin treatments (39Desikan R. Clarke A. Atherfold P. Hancock J.T. Neill S.J. Planta. 1999; 210: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We also isolated two parsley MAPKs belonging to the AtMPK3 class and have shown that both become activated following Pep-13 treatment. Whether these two kinases share a common function remains to be determined. One might suppose that they could have, despite their high degree of sequence identity, slight differences with respect to substrate specificities and interaction with activators and deactivators, or even that their expression profile in planta might differ. InArabidopsis quite a number of such highly homologous MAPK pairs have been identified (29The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7056) Google Scholar, 31Ichimura K. Tena G. Henry Y. Zhang S. Hirt H. Ellis B.E. Morris P.C. Wilson C. Champion A. Innes R.W. Sheen J. Ecker J.R. Scheel D. Klessig D.F. Machida Y. Mundy J. Ohashi Y. Kreis M. Heberle-Bors E. Walker J.C. Shinozaki K. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar), and it will be interesting in the future to learn to what extent their functions are redundant.The other Pep-13-responsive MAPK was shown to be PcMPK6, a homologue of the AtMPK6, SIPK, and SIMK MAPKs from Arabidopsis, tobacco, and alfalfa, respectively, each of which has been shown to be activated following elicitation (32Droi"

By using two double mutants from two different sites located in the C2 domain of protein kinase Cα, we have determined and characterized the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site in the protein, which was found to be important for its activation. Thus, there are two distinct sites in the C2 domain: the first, the lysine-rich cluster located in the β3- and β4-sheets and which activates the enzyme through direct binding of PtdIns(4,5)P2; and the second, the already well described site formed by the Ca2+-binding region, which also binds phosphatidylserine and a result of which the enzyme is activated. The results obtained in this work point to a sequential activation model, in which protein kinase Cα needs Ca2+ before the PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent activation of the enzyme can occur.

PtdIns(4,5)P2 can either bind to intracellular proteins and directly modulate their subcellular localization and activity, or it can act as a precursor for the generation of different second messengers. For example, several families of phospholipase C enzymes are responsible for the hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2in cells, leading to the production of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (4Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 6Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar), which may, in turn, lead to the activation of different proteins such as some PKC isotypes. Protein kinase C (PKC) composes a large family of serine/threonine kinases, which is activated by many extracellular signals and plays a critical role in many signal-transducing pathways in the cell (7Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar, 8Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem.

Based on their enzymatic properties, the mammalian PKC isotypes have been grouped into smaller subfamilies. The first group, which includes the classical isoforms α, βI, βII, and γ, can be distinguished from the other groups because its activity is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and, cooperatively, by Ca2+ and acidic phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylserine (PS). Members of the second group are the novel mammalian (δ, ε, η, and θ) and yeast PKCs that are not regulated by Ca2+. The third group comprises the atypical PKC isoforms, ζ, ι, and λ, whose regulation has not been clearly established, although it is clear that they are not regulated by DAG or Ca2+ (8Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 10Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In classical PKC isoenzymes, Ca2+-dependent binding to membranes shows a high specificity for 1,2-sn-phosphatidyl-l-serine (11Lee M.H. Bell R.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1041-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 13Johnson J.E.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Additionally, this group of isoenzymes is sensitive to other anionic phospholipids, including phosphatidic acid and polyphosphoinositides (15Newton A. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 16Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and to a variety of amphipathic membrane compounds, such as arachidonic acid and free fatty acids (17Khan W.A. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 171-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that the presence of other anionic phospholipids in the vesicles decreases the requirement of phosphatidylserine, suggesting that PKC activation, other than the classical activation pathway (activation of phospholipase C and production of diacylglycerol by hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2and increase of intracytosolic Ca2+), could take placein vivo (15Newton A. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In view of the interest in PtdIns(4,5)P2 as a second messenger, several studies (11Lee M.H.

However, the results show little consistency as to which of the different PKC isotypes are activated or as regards their specificity for the different lipids employed. These conflicting results are probably due to the different ways used by investigators to activate the enzyme. It has been described that the C2 domains of several proteins, such as synaptotagmin (25Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

These lysine-rich sequences probably represent the inositol phosphate-binding portions of larger phosphoinositide-binding domains. For example, in synaptotagmin, this basic sequence is flanked by regions rich in hydrophobic residues that could mediate acyl chain interactions (3Martin T.F.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). When we look at the amino acidic sequence of the PKCα-C2 domain, we observe that some of the Lys/Arg residues described for synaptotagmin are conserved. Previous studies in our laboratory (32Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Fita I. Verdaguer N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) have suggested that the highly positive charged β3-β4-sheets could interact electrostatically with the negatively charged phospholipids located at the membrane surface. Whether or not this is significant in the context of the full-length protein is still not clear. In this paper, we focus on the characterization of the interaction mechanism between PKCα-C2 domain and PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the consequent enzyme activation. For this purpose, we cloned the PKCα C2 domain fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and full-length PKCα fused to a hemagglutinin (HA) tag, which enabled us to perform binding and specific activity studies. Site-directed mutagenesis of key residues located in two areas of the C2 domain shed light on the interaction of the classical isoenzyme with PtdIns(4,5)P2 and its activation mechanism. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate were purchased from Echelon Biosciences Inc. (Salt Lake City, UT). Phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol were purchased from Lipid Products (Nutfield, Surrey, UK), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was from Sigma. Rat PKCα cDNA was a gift from Drs. Nishizuka and Ono (Kobe University, Kobe, Japan). The cDNA fragment corresponding to residues 158–285 of the PKCα-C2 domain and mutants was amplified using PCR (33Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Rodrı́guez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Full-length PKCα mutants were generated by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (14Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S.

All constructs, both wild-type and mutant genes, were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCGN (a gift from Dr. Tanaka, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). This vector contains the cytomegalovirus promoter and the multicloning sites that allow expression of the genes fused 3′ to the HA epitope (35Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The cDNA fragment corresponding to residues 158–285 of the PKCα-C2 domain and mutants was amplified using PCR (33Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Rodrı́guez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The pGEX-KG plasmid containing the PKCα-C2 domain was transformed into HB101 Escherichia coli cells. Proteins were expressed and purified as described in a previous work (33Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Rodrı́guez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed with the Ca2+ phosphate method described by Wigler et al. (36Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng V.C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Protein purification was performed as described by Conesa-Zamoraet al. (14Conesa-Zamora P. Lopez-Andreo M.J. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13898-13905Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The procedure described by Davletov and Sudhof (37Davletof B. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used with minor modifications. A total of 10 μg of PKCα-C2 domain bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used. Lipid vesicles were generated by mixing chloroform lipid solutions in the desired proportions and then dried from the organic solvent under a nitrogen stream and further dried under vacuum for 60 min. 1,2-Dipalmitoyl-l-3-phosphatidyl-N-[methyl-3H]choline (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity 56 Ci/mmol) was included in the lipid mixture as a tracer, a concentration of ∼3000–6000 cpm/mg phospholipid. Dried phospholipids were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EGTA by vigorous vortexing and subjected to direct probe sonication (four cycles of 1 min). Beads with protein bound to them were prewashed with the respective test solutions and resuspended in 50 μl of the corresponding lipid solution. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 15 min with vigorous shaking and then briefly centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge. The beads were washed twice with 0.4 ml of the incubation buffer without liposomes. Liposome binding was then quantified by liquid scintillation counting of the beads. The data in the paper and figures are expressed in number of nmol of lipid bound/10 μg of protein. PKCα was incubated with multilamellar vesicles (500 μm total lipid in 0.15 ml) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 15 min. Vesicle-bound enzyme was separated from the free enzyme by centrifuging the mixture at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 20 °C. Aliquots from the supernatants and pellets were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% separating gel). The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane after electrophoresis. Immunoblot analysis of the epitope tag fused to the protein was performed by using anti-HA antibody 12CA5 and developed with chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The proteins were analyzed by densitometry. The lipids used for the reaction were previously dried under a stream of N2, and the last traces of organic solvent were removed by keeping the samples under vacuum for 1 h. Lipids were suspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mmEGTA and vortexed vigorously to form multilamellar vesicles. A 20-μl sample of the lipids was added to the reaction mixture (final volume, 150 μl), which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mg/ml histone III-S, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (300,000 cpm/nmol), 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 μm CaCl2. The reaction was started by addition of 5 μl of the PKCα purified from transfected HEK293 cells. After 10 or 30 min, the reaction was stopped with 1 ml of ice-cold 25% trichloroacetic acid and 1 ml of ice-cold 0.05% bovine serum albumin. After precipitation on ice for 30 min, the protein precipitate was collected on a 2.5-cm glass fiber filter (Sartorius) and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of 32Pi incorporated into histone was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The linearity of the assay was confirmed from the time course of histone phosphorylation during 30 min. Additional control experiments were performed with mock cell lysates to estimate the endogenous PKCα and nonspecific activities, which represented less than 1% of the total enzyme activity measured. The PDB identifiers for the experimentally determined C2 and ENTH domain structures used in the calculations were 1DSY (38Verdaguer N. Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Ochoa W.F. Fita I. Gómez- Fernández J.C.

Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The Swiss-PDB Viewer 3.7 program by GlaxoSmithKline R&D Geneva (57Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) was used to visualize the structures. Our first aim was to characterize the biochemical properties of the interaction between PtdIns(4,5)P2 and the C2 domain of PKCα. For this, a recombinant fusion protein was used, in which the C2 domain of PKCα was NH2-terminally fused to GST (PKCα-C2 domain) (33Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Rodrı́guez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dependence of phospholipid binding on the PtdIns(4,5)P2concentration was studied by using phospholipid vesicles containing POPC/POPS (4:1, mol/mol) in the presence and in the absence of 100 μm CaCl2 (Fig. 1 A). The results show that in the presence of Ca2+, PtdIns(4,5)P2 slightly inhibited the PKCα-C2 domain phospholipid binding activity, which amounted to 8 nmol regardless of the PtdIns(4,5)P2concentration in the lipid vesicles. More interesting were the results obtained in the absence of Ca2+ because, in this case, the PKCα-C2 domain bound to a similar phospholipid vesicle composition in a PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent manner, showing a maximal binding of 7 nmol and a [PIP2] 12 value of 1 mol % (Fig. 1 A). These results suggest that the C2 domain of PKCα may interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2independently of Ca2+. To explore whether this mechanism is specific to PtdIns(4,5)P2 or is related to the net negative charges present in the membrane, binding assays were performed by substituting PtdIns(4,5)P2 as supplier of net negative charges to the phospholipid vesicles (POPC/POPS/PIP2, 75:20:5 mol/mol) for POPS (POPC/POPS, 70:30). It was observed that 7 nmol of lipid were bound in the former case and only 1.3 nmol in the latter case (Fig. 1 A, inset), suggesting that there is a certain specificity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 and that the increased binding observed under these conditions is not only dependent on the net negative charges present at the membrane vesicles. In order to study whether Ca2+ can affect the PKCα-C2 domain binding affinity in the absence of POPS in the lipid vesicles, binding assays were performed with POPC and increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2 concentrations in the absence and in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2 (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of Ca2+, lipid binding reached a maximum of 7 nmol and [PIP2] 12 = 1.2 mol %, whereas in the presence of Ca2+, binding reached 9 nmol and [PIP2] 12 = 0.3 mol %. This demonstrates that in the absence of POPS, Ca2+ slightly increases both the affinity of the protein for PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles and the maximal binding capacity. The data described above might be explained by the existence of two types of binding mechanism, one Ca2+/PS-dependent and the other mostly Ca2+-independent and PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent. Whether these two mechanisms corresponded to two different sites in the domain or to just one site with different biochemical behaviors could still not be answered at this point. To address this question, we made use of two PKCα-C2 domain mutants. One of them (PKCα-C2-D246N/D248N) has been demonstrated to be affected in the Ca2+-binding site (33Corbalán-Garcı́a S. Rodrı́guez-Alfaro J.A. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Conesa-Zamora P. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Corbalan-Garcia S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A) and does not bind Ca2+ or PS. The second (PKCα-C2-K209A/K211A) has been demonstrated to be affected in an area corresponding to a lysine-rich cluster located in the β3-β4-sheets (Fig. 2 C) and partially lacks its ability to bind PS or phosphatidic acid in the absence of Ca2+ (32Ochoa W.F. Corbalan-Garcia S. Eritja R. Rodriguez-Alfaro J.A. Gomez-Fernandez J.C. Fita I. Verdaguer N. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B shows the results obtained when PKCα-C2-D246N/D248N mutant was employed in the binding assays using vesicles containing POPC and increasing concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the absence of Ca2+. In this case, maximal binding activity was 8 nmol of lipid and [PIP2] 12 = 0.5 mol %. These results are slightly higher than those obtained when the wild-type C2 domain was used in the assay (Figs. 1 B and 2 B, dotted line), suggesting that the substitution of these residues located at the Ca2+-binding site has no effect on the ability of the domain to bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2-containing vesicles in a Ca2+-independent manner. Furthermore, the results obtained suggest that the neutralization of the Ca2+-binding sites performed by the mutagenesis strategy probably helps to reduce the negative electrostatic potential exhibited by this area, in a similar way to the effect brought about by Ca2+ when it binds to this region (40Murray D. Honig B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), thus facilitating the slight increase in the binding affinity observed in both cases. When the second mutant, PKCα-C2-K209A/K211A, was included in the binding assay under the same conditions as described above (Fig. 2 D), only 1.3 nmol of lipids were bound to the protein, indicating that these two residues are directly involved in the Ca2+-independent and PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent binding activity of the domain. Furthermore, when this experiment was performed in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2, the PKCα-C2-K209A/K211A mutant was able to bind only 5.3 nmol of lipids at high concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which amounted to only 58% of the lipid bound with wild-type protein under these conditions (Fig. 2 D). In summary, these data support a double-site model for PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding. The first and most important would be the lysine-rich cluster, which binds PtdIns(4,5)P2 with no need for Ca2+, and the second would be located in the Ca2+ binding region. However, this last site exhibits a relatively low affinity for PtdIns(4,5)P2 even in the presence of Ca2+, suggesting that this inositide fits better in the lysine-rich region than in the Ca2+ binding region. As described in the Introduction, PKCα activation is regulated by multiple factors (10Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). Moreover, several of the domains included in the protein are involved in the full activation of the enzyme, which further complicates the situation. To investigate the role of this new PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site in PKCα membrane translocation, the binding of the protein to POPC multilamellar vesicles was studied by including 5 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 or 20 mol % POPS in the presence of Ca2+ and, in some cases, using a phorbol ester (PMA) as a C1 domain-dependent activator (Fig. 3 A). Both PtdIns(4,5)P2 and POPS were able to produce 50% protein translocation to the membranes in the absence of PMA. This translocation increased to 75% when both phospholipids were included in the same vesicles (5 mol % PIP2 and 20 mol % POPS). As expected, the inclusion of a saturating concentration of PMA (0.3 mol %) cooperated and increased the proportion of translocated protein to 100%, independently of the negatively charged phospholipids present in the membrane vesicles. Strikingly, very different results were obtained when these experiments were performed in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B). No PKCα translocation was detected in the absence of PMA. Furthermore, when 0.3 mol % PMA was included in the assay, only 10% of protein translocation was detected in vesicles containing either POPS or PtdIns(4,5)P2/POPS, suggesting that these binding sites were not functional or accessible to the membrane vesicles under these conditions. To test this further, a PKCα substrate (histone III-S) was included in the binding reaction. In this case, protein translocation was 51, 42, and 45% when PtdIns(4,5)P2, POPS, or POPS/PtdIns(4,5)P2, respectively, were included in the vesicles, indicating that the presence of substrate enhances the ability of the PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PS sites to interact with the lipid vesicles. When PMA and histone were included in the model membranes, protein translocation to them was 100%, suggesting that under these conditions either PtdIns(4,5)P2 or POPS with PMA access their corresponding sites (C2 and C1 domain, respectively), producing full translocation of the enzyme to the membrane vesicles. To study whether protein translocation to the phospholipid vesicles correlates with its activation, PKCα specific activity was measured under conditions similar to that used in the binding assays. Fig. 4 A shows the catalytic activity of the enzyme in the presence of 100 μmCaCl2, 0.3 mol % PMA, and increasing concentrations of POPS or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the phospholipid vesicles. Under these conditions, 20 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 increased enzyme activity more than 5 times that obtained when using vesicles containing 20 mol % POPS. These data correlate well with the binding assays, because 5 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 exhibited a similar binding and activation capacity to 20 mol % POPS. In the absence of Ca2+, vesicles containing PtdIns(4,5)P2 increased the enzyme activity more than 6 times that obtained with POPS-containing vesicles, which also suggested an important role for the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site in enzyme activation under these conditions (Fig. 4 B). These data correlated well with those obtained in the binding assay, because full translocation of the enzyme to the phospholipid vesicles occurred in the presence of histone and PMA. Note also that the PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent specific activity of PKCα in the presence of Ca2+ is almost 3 times the specific activity obtained in the absence of Ca2+, indicating again that, directly or indirectly, Ca2+ plays a role in the PtdIns(4,5)P2-dependent activation of the enzyme. To address this question the same C2 domain mutants as above were used in the context of full-length PKCα, namely PKCα-D246N/D248N and PKCα-K209A/K211A to measure the effect of increasing concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and POPS on the specific enzyme activity. The results were compared with those obtained with wild-type protein. Fig. 5 A shows the activation of PKCα-D246N/D248N and PKCα-K209A/K211A in the presence of 100 μm CaCl2, 0.3 mol % PMA, and increasing concentrations of PtdIns(4,5)P2. It can be clearly observed that PKCα-K209A/K211A activation represents only 34% and PKCα-D246N/D248N 60% of the total activity exhibited by wild-type protein (Table I).Table ISpecific activity of wild-type PKCα and its mutants (nmol of Pi /min/mg)+PMA−PMA, +Ca2++Ca2+−Ca2+PKCα812275620PKCα-D246N/D248N485240276PKCα-K209A/K211A279235113Specific activity of the enzyme was measured in the presence of vesicles containing 20 mol % PtdIns(4,5)P2 and 80 mol % POPC.

McCune B.K. Sporn M.B. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 557-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). On the other hand, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) have potent catabolic activities, inhibiting the expression of several extracellular matrix components and activating that of matrix metalloproteinases (2Mauviel A.

Antagonistic activities of pro-inflammatory cytokines against TGF-β are thus believed to play an essential role in maintaining tissue homeostasis and extracellular matrix deposition (3Mauviel A.

For example, differential induction of c-Jun and JunB, transcription factors of the AP-1 family that exhibit antagonistic transcriptional activities, underlies the differential regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 gene expression by TGF-β and pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1 (7Mauviel A.

More recently, it was shown that several signaling pathways, such as those for NF-κB and JAK (Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator oftranscription), activated in response to various stimuli, such as cytokines, shear stress, and UV light, lead to an increased expression of inhibitory SMAD7, which, in turn, prevents signaling from the TGF-β receptors (8Topper J.N.

Alternatively, induction of c-Jun by cytokines has been shown to directly interfere with the SMAD pathway either by preventing SMAD3 binding to cognate DNA sequences or by sequestering the transcriptional coactivator p300 (6Verrecchia F.

Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar). Three distinct genes encode JNKs,jnk1, jnk2, and jnk3; the first two are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the latter one is selectively expressed in the heart, testis, and brain. Dual Thr and Tyr phosphorylation of JNK by the two MAPK kinases MKK4 and MKK7 results in its activation and nuclear translocation, after which it phosphorylates several transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF2 (16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by JNK is thought to be critical for its maximal transcriptional activity (17Yang D. Tournier C. Wysk M., Lu, H.T., Xu, J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3004-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of constitutively active MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK kinasekinase-1), which, in turn, activates several MAPKs including JNK, has been shown to inhibit TGF-β/SMAD signaling through stabilization of SMAD-Jun interactions (12Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this study, using genetically modifiedjnk1/2 −/−,nemo −/−, and junAA mouse embryo fibroblasts, we have further refined the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the antagonistic activities of pro-inflammatory cytokines against TGF-β. Our study establishes a key role for JNK activation by TNF-α in blocking TGF-β-induced SMAD signaling and SMAD-dependent transactivation of fibrillar collagen genes, whereas the NF-κB pathway, also activated by these cytokines, plays little role (if any) in this regulation. In addition, we provide novel evidence that JunB is a substrate for JNK that is able to substitute for c-Jun in mediating the JNK-dependent inhibitory effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines against TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Immortalized fibroblast cell lines were derived from wild-type (WT),jnk1/2 −/− (referred to asjnk −/−; targeted disruption of thejnk1 and jnk2 genes) (18Sabapathy K. Jochum W. Hochedlinger K.

Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin G, and 0.25 μg/ml FungizoneTM. Human recombinant TGF-β1 was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); it is referred to as TGF-β throughout the text. Human recombinant IL-1β and TNF-α were purchased from Roche Diagnostic. (CAGA)9-Lux was used as a reporter construct specific for SMAD3/4-driven signaling (21Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). pNF-κB-Lux and pAP-1-TA-Lux (MercuryTM pathway profiling vectors, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used to determine NF-κB- and AP-1-driven transcription, respectively. For c-Jun, JunB, and ATF2 expression, we used full-length human cDNAs cloned into the pRSVe expression vector (3Mauviel A. Chen Y. Dong W. Evans C.H. Uitto J. Curr.

Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3332-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have been described previously. To determine JNK activation by TNF-α, we used a reporter system derived from the mammalian one-hybrid system, consisting of a reporter plasmid (Gal4-Lux) and a transactivator plasmid encoding a chimeric transactivator protein (Gal4BD-c-Jun) consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (Gal4BD) and the transactivation domain of c-Jun that requires phosphorylation by JNK to fully transactivate Gal4-Lux (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation procedure with a commercial assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). pRSV-β-galactosidase was cotransfected in every experiment to monitor transfection efficiencies. In this context, it should be noted that basal promoter activities did not vary significantly between the various cell lines used in this study (<15%), with the exception of the junAA-transformed fibroblasts, which exhibited a 50–60% reduction in transfection efficiency compared with all other cell lines. Interestingly, endogenous levels of c-Jun, JNK, and SMAD3/4-DNA complexes and mRNA steady-state levels for type I and III collagens were very similar between cell lines (see corresponding data description under “Results”). Luciferase activity was determined with a commercial kit (Promega). For high transfection efficiency of the pRSV-c-Jun expression vector, cells were electroporated with a NucleofectorTM (Amaxa GmbH, Köln, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfection efficiency was estimated to be ∼80% by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of a cotransfected green fluorescent protein expression vector (data not shown). Total RNA was obtained using an RNeasy kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and analyzed by Northern hybridization (20 μg/lane) with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for COL1A1 (24Chu M.L. de Wet W. Bernard M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2315-2320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), COL3A1 (25Chu M.L. Weil D. de Wet W. Bernard M. Sippola M. Ramirez F. J. Biol.

Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Hybridization signal was revealed with a PhosphorImager (Storm 840, Amersham Biosciences). A (CAGA)3 probe (21Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.-M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar) was used to determine specific SMAD3/4-DNA interactions. Nuclear extracts were isolated using a small-scale preparation (27Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates from fibroblast cultures were prepared by scraping into Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) after two washes in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The protein concentration of lysates was assayed with a one-step colorimetric method (Bio-Rad protein reagent), and 25 μg of protein was denatured by heating at 95 °C for 3 min prior to resolution by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose filters (AmershamBiosciences). The filters were placed in blocking solution (1× phosphate-buffered saline and 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun polyclonal antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or anti-c-Jun or anti-SMAD3 polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking solution for 1 h. After incubation, the filters were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The filters were then washed, developed according to ECL protocols (Amersham Biosciences), and revealed with the Storm 840 PhosphorImager. We previously provided evidence that inhibition of c-Jun expression prevents the antagonistic activity of TNF-α against TGF-β/SMAD signaling (6Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Conversely, c-Jun overexpression was shown to block TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Possible mechanisms underlying c-Jun inhibitory effects were identified: (a) interference with SMAD-DNA complex formation and (b) sequestration of the shared transcriptional coactivator p300. Also, it was previously reported that inhibition or activation of JNK activity in HepG2 cells could activate or inhibit TGF-β/SMAD signaling, respectively (12Dennler S. Prunier C. Ferrand N. Gauthier J.-M. Atfi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28858-28865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We first wanted to determine whether JNK activity is required for pro-inflammatory cytokines to antagonize TGF-β/SMAD signaling. As shown in Fig. 1 A, expression of both an antisense vector against c-Jun and a dominant-negative MKK4 vector prevented the inhibitory effect of TNF-α on TGF-β-driven (CAGA)9-Lux transactivation in human dermal fibroblasts. On the other hand, overexpression of a dominant-negative form of IκB kinase-α, known to block NF-κB activation and subsequent nuclear translocation, was without effect on the inhibitory effect exerted by TNF-α. Similar results were obtained when IL-1β (10 units/ml) was used instead of TNF-α (data not shown). To further understand the mechanisms by which pro-inflammatory cytokines (known inducers of JNK activity) are capable of interfering with the SMAD pathway, we next investigated the potential implication of another MAPK kinase, MKK7 (known to activate JNK), in mediating TNF-α inhibition of SMAD signaling. As shown in Fig. 1 B, when MKK4 activity was blocked by expression of its dominant-negative mutant form, MKK7 overexpression was able to significantly rescue the inhibitory activity of TNF-α. A similar rescue mechanism was observed when IL-1β was used instead of TNF-α (data not shown), indicating that both MKK4 and MKK7 may contribute to the signaling cascade activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines to counteract TGF-β/SMAD signaling. To ascertain the role played by the JNK pathway and to definitely rule out the possible implication of NF-κB, the antagonistic activity of TNF-α against TGF-β/SMAD signaling was examined in immortalized fibroblast lines derived fromjnk −/− and nemo −/−mouse embryos. To fully exploit the analytical power of such a cellular system, it was important to determine how the various signaling pathways to be investigated were regulated by cytokines in the different cell lines. First, as shown in Fig. 2 A and consistent with our expectations from the literature, NF-κB-dependent gene transactivation in response to TNF-α was absent innemo −/− fibroblasts, but normal injnk −/− fibroblasts. Inversely, AP-1-dependent gene expression downstream of TNF-α was normal in nemo −/− fibroblasts, but absent injnk −/− fibroblasts (Fig. 2 B). Second, we examined the capacity of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate JNK in the various cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2 C, TNF-α efficiently transactivated the Gal4-Lux construct in the presence of Gal4BD-c-Jun in WT and nemo −/−fibroblasts, but not in jnk −/− fibroblasts, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of jnk1 andjnk2 is sufficient to completely eliminate JNK activity. This is likely representative of an absence of JNK3 expression in these cells, which would be consistent with its known strict tissue-specific expression (15Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar). The specificity of JNK activity in the various cell types was further confirmed by Western blot analysis of phospho-c-Jun content in response to TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 2 D, TNF-α stimulation of both WT and nemo −/− fibroblasts resulted in a dramatic induction of c-Jun phosphorylation (lanes 2 and 6 versus lanes 1 and 5), the latter not being detected in the jnk −/−fibroblasts (lane 4 versus lane 3). To complete our characterization of these cell lines in terms of growth factor response, we next examined the transactivation of (CAGA)9-Lux by TGF-β in jnk −/−,nemo −/−, and junAA immortalized fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 3 A, full SMAD3/4-dependent responsiveness downstream of TGF-β was observed in all cell lines, indicating that neither JNK nor NF-κB activity nor the c-Jun phosphorylation state plays a role in TGF-β-driven SMAD3/4 responses. Of note, using the Gal4-based transactivation assay system, we determined that TGF-β did not activate JNK in any cell type (data not shown). Together, these results validate our model system for further investigation of the functional aspects of cytokine/TGF-β transcriptional antagonism in a cellular context exhibiting normal TGF-β/SMAD responsiveness, but devoid of either JNK or NF-κB activity or in which c-Jun phosphorylation by JNK is impossible. As shown in Fig. 3 A, TNF-α-mediated inhibition of SMAD signaling, as measured using the (CAGA)9-Lux vector as a reporter system, was consistently observed in immortalized WT fibroblasts, as well as innemo −/− and junAA fibroblasts, but not in jnk −/− fibroblasts, suggesting (a) a critical role for JNK and (b) the existence of alternative mechanisms not requiring c-Jun phosphorylation to allow the inhibitory activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines against TGF-β. To determine whether this cellular context-specific inhibitory activity of TNF-α correlates with the known ability of TNF-α to interfere with SMAD-DNA complex formation in normal human dermal fibroblasts (6Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), EMSA experiments were carried out using nuclear extracts from WT,jnk −/−, and nemo −/−fibroblasts treated with TGF-β and/or TNF-α for 30 min, a time point previously shown to be ideal for the detection of SMAD-DNA complexes after TGF-β stimulation (28Vindevoghel L. Kon A. Lechleider R.J. Uitto J. Roberts A.B. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13053-13057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Vindevoghel L. Lechleider R.J.

As shown in Fig. 3 B(left panel), in the three cell types, a unique protein-DNA complex was equally induced by TGF-β (second, sixth, andtenth bars). Supershift experiments with an anti-SMAD3 antibody confirmed that this complex is indeed a SMAD-DNA complex (Fig. 3 B, right panel). TNF-α efficiently reduced TGF-β-induced SMAD-DNA complex formation in both WT (lane 4 versus lane 2) andnemo −/− (lane 12 versus lane 10) mouse fibroblast extracts, whereas no reduction in SMAD-DNA complex formation could be observed in jnk −/−fibroblasts (lane 8 versus lane 6). No change in total SMAD3 content (measured by Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts) was observed in WT fibroblasts treated with TNF-α for 30 min to 24 h (data not shown), indicating that the reduced amount of SMAD-DNA complexes observed in EMSAs and the reduced SMAD-dependent gene transactivation when TNF-α was added concomitantly with TGF-β (see above) are not due to reduced SMAD3 levels in response to TNF-α. Parallel EMSA with an NF-κB-specific probe (Fig. 3 C) highlighted the lack of correlation between TNF-α-dependent reduction in SMAD-DNA complexes seen in Fig. 3 B and the induction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity. Because c-Jun is a key effector of TNF-α inhibitory activity in SMAD signaling (6Verrecchia F. Pessah M. Atfi A. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30226-30231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we overexpressed c-Jun instead of adding exogenous TNF-α and examined its inhibitory potential on SMAD signaling in WT,jnk −/−, and nemo −/−fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 4 A, c-Jun inhibitory activity against SMAD-driven TGF-β-induced (CAGA)9-Lux transactivation was readily observed in WT andnemo −/− fibroblasts, but absent injnk −/− fibroblasts, suggesting a critical role for c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation in the inhibitory activity of c-Jun against the SMAD pathway. To determine the origin of such JNK activity in WT cells, several approaches were taken. First, potential activation of JNK by TGF-β was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 B (upper panel), no JNK phosphorylation in response to TGF-β (detected by Western blot analysis of endogenous phospho-JNK proteins) was observed 15 min to 24 h after TGF-β addition. An antibody directed against JNK verified that the total JNK content was identical in each sample (middle panel). These data are consistent with our previous demonstration that TGF-β is able to transactivate AP-1-dependent genes only in epithelial cells, but not in fibroblasts (7Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Second, to determine the possibility of basal JNK activity in unstimulated cultured fibroblasts, we used a Gal4-based transactivation system. Specifically, a Gal4BD-c-Jun fusion protein expression vector was cotransfected together with the Gal4-Lux reporter vector in WT fibroblasts in the absence or presence of a dominant-negative MKK4 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 4 C, expression of Gal4BD-c-Jun led to a 2.5-fold elevation of Gal4-Lux activity. Overexpression of dominant-negative MKK4 fully repressed Gal4BD-c-Jun-induced luciferase activity, consistent with the idea that transactivation of Gal4-Lux by Gal4BD-c-Jun is a JNK-dependent mechanism. Third, we determined whether, upon c-Jun overexpression, a significant fraction of c-Jun would be phosphorylated. Significantly higher amounts of c-Jun protein were detected in extracts from fibroblasts transfected with a c-Jun expression vector with NucleofectorTM compared with extracts from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4 D, middle panel, lane 3 versus lane 1). Interestingly, such high expression of c-Jun was accompanied by strongly elevated levels of phospho-c-Jun (upper panel, lane 3 versus lane 1), very similar to the levels obtained in mock-transfected cells treated with TNF-α (lane 2). Together, these data suggest the existence of detectable levels of JNK activity in unstimulated cultured fibroblasts, sufficient to convey both Gal4-Lux transactivation by Gal4BD-c-Jun and the inhibitory effect of overexpressed c-Jun against TGF-β/SMAD signaling. To verify that the lack of TNF-α effect against TGF-β/SMAD signaling injnk −/− fibroblasts is effectively due to the knockout of JNK activity, the effect of jnk1 expression rescue was examined. As shown in Fig. 5, ectopic expression of jnk1, which had no significant effect on SMAD signaling per se in WT fibroblasts, entirely rescued the inhibitory effect of TNF-α in jnk −/−fibroblasts, attesting that the lack of inhibitory effect of TNF-α is strictly due to the absence of JNK activity. Our next aim was to determine which JNK substrate(s) may be able to interfere with TGF-β/SMAD signaling. For this purpose, the effect of overexpression of c-Jun, JunB, and ATF2, three known JNK substrates (16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), on (CAGA)9-Lux transactivation was examined in WT andjnk −/− fibroblasts. The results presented in Fig. 6 A indicate that c-Jun and JunB (but not ATF2) exerted an inhibitory activity against TGF-β in wild-type cells, but not in jnk −/−fibroblasts. Similarly, in human dermal fibroblasts, c-Jun and JunB inhibitory activity against TGF-β/SMAD signaling was strongl"

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central feature is the function of MalT, a transcriptional activator that needs the cAMP/CAP complex, the inducer maltotriose and ATP for the specific activation of ς70-programmed RNA polymerase (14Raibaud O. Richet E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3059-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Raibaud O. Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. J. Mol.

In addition, MalK, the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the ABC transporter, is closely connected to the control of MalT activity (17Boos W. Böhm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The basic transcriptional machinery in Archaea appears to be more similar to eukaryotes than to prokaryotes (19Thomm M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 159-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, transcription initiation requires three promoter elements, the TATA box centered at −26/−27 from the start point of transcription, a transcription factor B recognition element (BRE)1comprising two adenines upstream of the TATA box, and an initiation element around the transcription initiation site. Correspondingly, the minimal factors needed to facilitate binding of the eukaryotic polymerase II-like archaeal RNA polymerase to the promoter are TATA box-binding protein (TBP) and transcription factor binding protein (21Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 22Hausner W. Thomm M. J.

One would therefore expect that regulation of transcription in Archaea would follow eukaryotic rather than prokaryotic schemes (24Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Yet, the few examples of Archaeal transcriptional regulation point to a bacterial-like regulation. MDR1 (metal-dependent repressor) was found to inhibit RNA polymerase function in Archaeoglobus fulgidus (25Bell S.D. Cairns S.S. Robson R.L. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 971-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and Lrs14 regulates its own expression by preventing the binding of TBP at the corresponding BRE-TATA box in Sulfolobus sp. (26Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31624-31629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Homologues to the bacterial Lrp/AsnC family of transcriptional regulators were found in Methanococcus jannaschii andP. furiosus (27Napoli A. Van der Oost J. Sensen C.W. Charlebois R.L. Rossi M.

In contrast to the growing understanding of the basic machinery of transcription initiation, the understanding of the specific regulation of this process, especially for genes involved in sugar uptake and metabolism, is not well understood (31Voorhorst W.G.B. Gueguen Y. Geerling A.C.M. Schut G. Dahlke I. Thomm M. van der Oost J. de Vos W.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3777-3783Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization of TrmB (t ranscriptionalr egulator of m al operon) as a maltose/trehalose-specific gene regulator (repressor) for a cluster of genes encoding a high affinity ABC transporter as well as TrmB itself. Chromosomal DNA from T. litoralis was prepared as previously described (35Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, NY1987Google Scholar). PCR was performed using chromosomal DNA as template and primers encompassing trmB. 5′ ends carriedNcoI and BamHI restriction sites for convenient cloning. After digestion with the corresponding restriction enzyme, the fragment was ligated into plasmid pCS19 (36Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) containing a C-terminal His6 tag. The resulting plasmid was named pSL152. It is ampicillin-resistant, contained the lacI q gene and expressed trmB under isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible promoter control.E. coli strain SF120 (37Baneyx F. Georgiou G. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2696-2703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with pSL152 selecting for ampicillin resistance. For TrmB expression, cells were grown in NZA medium [10 g NZ-amine A (Sheffield Product Inc), 5 g yeast extract, 7.5 g NaCl per liter] at 30 °C. 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added at OD 0.5–0.7, and cells were grown for 5 more h at 37 °C and harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml Ni-NTA affinity solution (buffer I; 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), ruptured in a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged for 30 min at 17,300 × g. The supernatant was heated to 80 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation of the precipitated proteins, the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA superflow column from Qiagen equilibrated with buffer I. The column was washed with 50 mm imidazole and eluted with 250 mm imidazole, both in the same buffer. TrmB-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 200 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.5, and subsequently against 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. The final concentration of purified TrmB was about 1.0 mg/ml. It was kept frozen at −70 °C. Labeled DNA was obtained from appropriate PCR products and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The labeled DNA was purified using mini Quick Spin Columns (Roche). The binding buffer was 25 mm HEPES, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 10% glycerin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.5. All samples contained about 40 nCi labeled DNA (0.5–1 μm) and 1 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC) competitor DNA (Roche, Germany) per 10 μl. TrmB and sugar were added in the concentrations indicated in the legends to the figures. The reaction samples were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, mixed with 3 μl of loading buffer (25 mmHEPES, 150 mm potassium-glutamate, pH 7.5 containing 50% glycerol and 0.05% bromphenol blue), loaded directly onto 8% native PAGE gels, and run at room temperature under a constant voltage of 200 V. For footprinting, the DNA fragment containing the target promoter region was produced using two primers in the PCR. The first, starting in the putative sugar kinase, is 5′-CCCAAGCCTTCTCAGACCAACTACA-3′ (coding strand); the second, starting in malE, is 5′-ATGTCTGTTGGCCACCAATG-3′ (noncoding strand). The primers were 5′-labeled with [γ -32P]dATP and polynucleotide kinase. The labeled PCR product (∼20,000 cpm) was incubated with TrmB at 70 °C for 10 min in binding buffer and digested with 0.005 units of DNaseI for 5 min at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped with Stop buffer containing 20 mmEDTA, 0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2, and put on liquid nitrogen immediately. The reaction samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and chloroform/isoamylalcohol, precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium actetate and 2.5 volume 96% ethanol, and centrifuged. The pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol. It was dried and resuspended in loading solution (0.3% bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol FF, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, 97.5% deionized formamide) and applied directly onto a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea. For primer-extension analysis, total RNA was isolated (38DiRuggiero J. Robb F.T. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar) from T. litoralis cells at different growth phases (6 and 12 h), with and without maltose induction (0.2%). Growth was in modified marine culture medium (6DiRuggiero J. Dunn D. Maeder D.L. Holley-Shanks R. Chatard J. Horlacher R. Robb F.T. Boos W. Weiss R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The start point for the 5′-end labeled primer was 90 nucleotides downstream of the malEtranslation start site. The sequence ladder was prepared from sequencing reactions with the same labeled primer. 50 μg of RNA together with the labeled primer (150,000 cpm) was precipitated with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of 96% ethanol. The precipitate was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge and washed with 70% ethanol. After resuspension in 10 μl of annealing buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA) the sample was denatured at 85 °C for 3 min and hybridized for 10 min at 55 °C. The primer-extension reaction was started by adding prewarmed avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase mixture (Promega; 1 unit). After 30 min at 37 °C, the sample was precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol as before and resuspended in 10 μl of loading solution containing formamide. 100 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2.5 μm or 5 μm TrmB were incubated with 0.1 μCi of [14C]maltose (0.65 μm) or [14C]trehalose (1.1 μm). Prior to the addition, the sugars had been mixed with unlabeled maltose or trehalose to reach a final chemical concentration between 2 and 100 μm for maltose and 2 μm and 10 mm for trehalose. Incubation was for 5 min at 80 °C. The assay was stopped with 2 ml of ice-cold saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and kept on ice for 10 min. The suspension was then filtered through cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Schleicher und Schüll; pore size 0.45 μm) and washed with 2 ml of 95% saturated ammonium sulfate in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. Bound radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. DNA was obtained from pMLP. This plasmid is derived from pUC19 and carries anEcoRI-BamHI fragment starting in the putative sugar kinase gene and ending in malE (see Fig. 1 A). The experimental conditions for the in vitro transcription assay (39Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. de Vos W.M. Thomm M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) are as follows. 300 ng of linearized pMLP DNA harboring the intergenic region (digested withEcoRI) in 40 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.3, 250 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.44 mm of each ATP, GTP, CTP, 0.002 mm UTP, and 2 μCi [α-32P]UTP were mixed with transcriptional components from P. furiosus, i.e. 25 ng of transcription factor binding protein (recombinant), 200 ng of TBP, (recombinant) and 110 ng of RNA polymerase. Maltose and trehalose were added to a final concentration of 25 μm to 100 mm, each. TrmB was added to final concentrations as indicated in the legend to Fig. 8. We used 25 mm Hepes, 300 mm potassium glutamate, pH 8.0, as buffer and 20 μg of TrmB in a 1-ml sample at 50 °C. Measurements were done with a PerkinElmer Model 650-40 instrument at 284 nm excitation and 336 nm emission (40Szmelcman S. Schwartz M. Silhavy T.J. Boos W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 65: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Sugars were added in 10-μl portions to a final concentration of 0.2 mm maltose and 2 mm trehalose, respectively. The search for the specific gene regulator of the trehalose/maltose transport gene cluster was initiated by the observation that a lateral gene transfer between T. litoralis and P. furiosus had taken place: a 16-kb DNA fragment harboring this gene cluster had been transferred, probably in recent times (6DiRuggiero J. Dunn D. Maeder D.L. Holley-Shanks R. Chatard J. Horlacher R. Robb F.T. Boos W. Weiss R.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 684-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Because the trehalose-specific induction of the transporter had been maintained after the transfer, it seemed likely that the elements of induction were also present on the 16-kb DNA fragment. Therefore, we cloned all of the genes contained on it as His-tag variants, which, as judged from their sequence, might be candidates to encode transcriptional regulators. We expressed these genes in E. coli, purified the corresponding proteins, and tested them in a gel-shift assay using a DNA fragment spanning the putative regulatory elements of the operon (see below). We obtained a positive signal with the protein encoded by the gene directly proximal to malK located within the cluster of transport genes (Fig. 1). We named the gene trmB(t ranscriptional r egulator of them al operon). Sequence homology searches revealed that TrmB (338 amino acids and 38,838 calculated molecular weight) belongs to the DUF118 gene family of Pfam (Sanger Institute, UK). Weak homology (30% identity over 159 consecutive amino acids) could be recognized with CymJ ofKlebsiella oxytoca, YrhO of Bacillus subtilis(26% identity over 165 consecutive amino acids), and AF1232 fromArchaeoglobus fulgidus (27% identity over 194 consecutive amino acids). High homology was recognized with PH1034 ofPyrococcus horikoshii (71% identity over the full size protein) as shown in Fig. 2. These proteins exhibit sequence similarity mostly at the N terminus and contain a distinct helix-turn-helix motif. CymJ of K. oxytoca is also positioned within an operon encoding a binding protein-dependent ABC transporter specific for cyclodextrins (32Pajatsch M. Gerhart M. Peist R. Horlacher R. Boos W. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2630-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of CymJ has not been elucidated except that it is dispensable for transport. TrmB, as a C-terminal His-tag version, was overexpressed (from plasmid pSL152) in E. coli SF120 that is characterized by the lack of several proteases. Growth was in rich medium (NZA) at 30 °C and using 0.2 mm iso-propyl-β-d-thio-galactoside as inducer. Prior to Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, the cell-free extract was heated to 80 °C for 10 min to remove most of theE. coli proteins. After Ni-NTA chromatography, the protein exhibited one major band in SDS-PAGE with an apparent molecular weight of 38,800. The protein easily precipitated after dialysis overnight in Tris buffer, pH 7.6 containing 200 mm NaCl. The precipitate could be solubilized in 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, even without the addition of NaCl, and revealed a pure protein preparation. From 1 liter of culture, 4 mg of pure protein was routinely obtained. The intergenic region, upstream of the trehalose/maltose transport operon, contained an inverted repeat (TTTACTTTAXGXA), BRE (transcription factor B recognition element), a potential TATA box, and a putative RBS (Fig. 1 B). To determine the DNA elements that can be recognized by TrmB, we used EMSA. Fig. 3 B shows EMSA with different concentrations of TrmB and DNA encompassing the entire intergenic region (region 1). 1.5 μm TrmB was sufficient to completely shift the DNA. We noticed that after binding TrmB, a minor portion of the bound DNA never entered the gel, possibly indicating the formation of higher oligomeric forms of TrmB. We prepared three different size fragments of the promoter region. The region 1 fragment contained the entire intergenic region, region 2 the BRE-TATA box but not the inverted repeat sequence, and region 3 only the inverted repeat sequence as well as the proximal region leading into the gene encoding the putative sugar kinase (Fig. 3 A). When these three different labeled DNAs were used as EMSA probes, all were retarded by TrmB binding, the least effective one being region 3 (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the intergenic region must contain at least two binding sites for TrmB. To define the correct binding sites for TrmB, we used protection from DNaseI digestion in the presence of TrmB (Fig. 4). We used two samples labeled at one end: the coding and noncoding sequence (left andright in Fig. 4, respectively). We could observe two binding sites for TrmB. One is the promoter-proximal part of the inverted repeat sequence, 5′-CTTTAGGGATGTTTGTACTTAAAGTAAATAAATA-3′, and the other is the promoter itself, the BRE-TATA box, 5′-CAAAATATATATACTTTTAGTATATACA-3′ (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, TrmB binding to the promoter region will inhibit the binding of transcriptional components TBP and transcription factor binding protein and will thus prevent recruitment of RNA polymerase, essentially by repressing the initiation of transcription of themalE operon. When 100 μm maltose was added, TrmB no longer protected the DNA from DNaseI digestion (Fig. 4). The addition of 2.5 mm trehalose gave the same effect (data not shown). Thus, TrmB binding to the promoter elements is prevented by these sugars acting as inducers. Sugar-binding assays were done by ammonium sulfate precipitation in the presence of 14C-labeled sugar (33Richarme G. Kepes A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 16-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Maltose-binding was linearly dependent on TrmB concentration (Fig. 5 A), and TrmB was half-maximally saturated at 20 μm maltose (Fig. 5 B). The binding of maltose showed indications of sigmoidal behavior at two concentrations of TrmB (2.5 and 5 μm; only the data for 5 μm are shown in Fig. 5, Band C). This can hardly be recognized in the Michaelis-Menten plot shown in Fig. 5 B. However, it can easily be seen when only the amount of TrmB-bound radioactivity (but not the chemical amount of bound maltose) is plotted against the total maltose concentration (labeled plus unlabeled) as seen in Fig. 5 C. Because the amount of radioactive maltose in all assays is the same (61,000 cpm) the expected behavior for a noncooperative (Michaelis-Menten type) maltose-binding would be such that the number of TrmB-bound radioactivity would only decline when increasing amounts of unlabeled maltose are present in the assay. However, as seen in Fig. 5 C, the amount of labeled maltose bound to TrmB increased with increasing total maltose concentration before declining, suggesting positive cooperative binding. To better visualize this cooperativity in the calculated binding data of Fig. 5 B and to show the difference to a purely noncooperative, Michaelis-Menten type binding behavior, we added a theroretical Michaelis-Menten type binding curve using the concentration of half-maximal binding (20 μm) as the “K d” and 1.8 μm as maximally TrmB-bound maltose. Now the difference of maltose binding to TrmB and a purely Michaelis-Menten type binding is obvious. When radioactive trehalose was used in the binding assay, half-maximal binding was only observed at concentrations higher than 0.5 mm. But in contrast to maltose as substrate, the TrmB-bound radioactivity only declined with the addition of increasing amounts of unlabeled trehalose giving no indication of cooperative binding for trehalose (data not shown). Binding of labeled trehalose was abolished in the presence of unlabeled maltose (data not shown). Also, binding of maltose (at 0.65 μm concentration) could be chased by increasing amounts of trehalose (Fig. 5 C), showing initially (at lower trehalose concentration) the same phenomenon of cooperative binding of maltose with increasing amounts of unlabeled trehalose. Using the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of TrmB (284 nm excitation and 336 nm emission), we observed 15% reduction in fluorescence at 80 °C upon addition of 200 μm maltose but no effect with trehalose (data not shown). When maltose was included in the TrmB-mediated EMSA, it prevented the retardation of labeled region 1 DNA. The concentration of maltose that elicited the half-maximal effect was comparable with that which is needed to half-maximally saturate TrmB in the in vitro binding assay (20–50 μm). Surprisingly, trehalose showed the opposite effect. At concentrations comparable with half-maximal saturation of binding to TrmB (0.5 mm), there was no discernible effect in the EMSA. However, at 5–10 mmtrehalose, the stability of the TrmB-DNA complex was clearly increased and EMSA of region 1 became more effective (Fig. 6). To determine the transcriptional start point in the direction of malE, we prepared total RNA of cells harvested at early (6 h) and mid-log (12 h) phase grown in peptone (uninduced conditions) and peptone plus maltose (induced conditions). As primer we used DNA starting 90 base pairs downstream of the translational start site of malE. Also, we used a primer starting within gdh (encoding glutamate dehydrogenase) as control for a constitutively expressed gene. Fig. 7 shows the two transcription start sites in the malE direction. The major start site is 26 nucleotides downstream of the BRE-TATA box (AAATATA). The transcript is stronger when RNA was isolated from early log cultures than from mid-log cultures (Fig. 7). The transcript is not detectable when cells were grown under noninducing conditions (data not shown). To determine the function of TrmB in the transcription of the malE promoter, we used the established in vitro transcription assay with purified components (RNA polymerase, TBP, and transcription factor binding protein) from P. furiosus. As a control, we also used a constitutively transcribed gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase of P. furiosus. The templates used produced a transcript of 110 bases for the malE operon and of 89 bases for the gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (Fig. 8). When TrmB was present in increasing concentrations, the transcript of malE was reduced concomitantly. The presence of maltose prevented this inhibition at a concentration of 100 μm (Fig. 8 A). Surprisingly, trehalose had the same effect as maltose albeit at 25-fold higher concentration (above 2.5 mm; Fig. 8 B). At this and even higher concentrations, trehalose had not prevented the retardation of region 1 DNA during EMSA. In this publication we report the characterization of TrmB, a novel Archaeal substrate-specific transcriptional regulator controlling the maltose/trehalose-specific induction of the binding protein-dependent ABC transporter in T. litoralis. TrmB binds maltose and trehalose with 20 μm and >500 μm half-saturating concentration, respectively and is able to interfere with in vitro transcription of the malE promoter. In line with the binding properties of TrmB, maltose (100 μm) and trehalose (2.5 mm) were shown to prevent TrmB-mediated transcription inhibition. Thus, TrmB could be characterized as a transcriptional repressor. Like other Archaeal repressors, TrmB protected the TATA box as well as the adjacent BRE site in DNaseI protection assays. Thus, substrate-specific gene regulation appears to be based on the prevention of TBP binding and subsequent polymerase recruitment. The role of the inducer is to prevent TrmB from binding to the TATA box. In this function, maltose is much more effective (50–100 μm) than trehalose (2.5 mm). This appears physiologically reasonable because maltose is metabolized rather efficiently by T. litoralis (3Xavier K.B. Peist R. Kossmann M. Boos W. Santos H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3358-3367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and will never reach significant concentrations in vivo, whereas trehalose is accumulated, preferentially at high osmolarity, to high internal concentrations (34Lamosa P. Martins L.O. DaCosta M.S. Santos H. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 3591-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In E. coli, MalT, the central gene activator of the maltose system, interacts with the C-terminal extension of MalK, the ATP-hydrolyzing subunit of the ABC transporter, whose expression is controlled by MalT (17Boos W. Böhm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Böhm A. Diez J. Diederichs K. Welte W. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3708-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). T. litoralis MalK exhibits the same C-terminal regulatory extension as E. coli MalK. However, our attempts to demonstrate an interaction between isolated MalK of T. litoralis and TrmB were unsuccessful. Possibly, an interaction between these two proteins, if it occurs at all, is restricted to MalK when complexed with the membrane components of the transporter and occurs only in the process of actively transporting substrate. There is something curious about the effect of trehalose on TrmB and its interaction with the intergenic DNA region. Aside from the observation that binding of TrmB to trehalose is much weaker than to maltose, trehalose binding, in contrast to maltose binding, does not show signs of cooperativity and does not induce a conformational change that is detectable by fluorescence measurements. TrmB-mediated EMSA of the entire intergenic region (region 1 in Fig. 1) is prevented by maltose at concentrations that reflect its binding characteristics to TrmB but not by trehalose, even at concentrations exceeding the saturation of trehalose binding by TrmB; it even makes TrmB/DNA complex formation seemingly stronger even though trehalose binding to TrmB prevents footprinting and interferes with TrmB-mediatedmalE transcription. Presently, we have no sensible explanation for this curious effect of trehalose binding. TrmB elicits incomplete band shift of the BRE-TATA box alone. The same is seen with the inverted repeat motif. Thus, binding of TrmB to region 1 containing both the BRE-TATA box as well as the inverted repeat must be enhanced by cooperativity between the two sites. TrmB, when complexed with maltose, cannot recognize a potential binding site in the entire fragment of region 1. Because DNaseI protection assays with TrmB showed not only protection of the TATA box but also of the upstream inverted repeat, we conclude that binding of TrmB to the inverted repeat and BRE-TATA box is affected by maltose and trehalose. It remains to be seen whether binding of TrmB to both elements is involved in the regulation of malE transcription. Alternatively, TrmB binding to the inverted repeat could be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the divergently oriented gene encoding the putative sugar kinase. We thank Eva-Maria Ladenburger for her advice in the footprint technique."
https://openalex.org/W1987536328,"Consensus-binding sites for many transcription factors are relatively non-selective and found at high frequency within the genome. This raises the possibility that factors that are capable of binding to a cis-acting element in vitro and regulating transcription from a transiently transfected plasmid, which would not have higher order chromatin structure, may not occupy this site within the endogenous gene. Closed chromatin structure and competition from another DNA-binding protein with similar nucleotide specificity are two possible mechanisms by which a transcription factor may be excluded from a potential binding sitein vivo. Multiple transcription factors, including Pdx-1, BETA-2, and Pax6, have been implicated in expression of the insulin gene in pancreatic β cells. In this study, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay has been used to show that these factors do, in fact, bind to insulin control region sequences in intact β cells. In addition, another key islet-enriched transcription factor, Nkx2.2, was found to occupy this region using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In vitro DNA-binding and transient transfection assays defined how Nkx2.2 affected insulin gene expression. Pdx-1 was also shown to bind within a region of the endogenous islet amyloid polypeptide, pax-4, and glucokinase genes that were associated with control in vitro. Because Pdx-1 does not regulate gene transcription in isolation, these sequences were examined for occupancy by the other insulin transcriptional regulators. BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 were also found to bind to amyloid polypeptide, glucokinase, andpax-4 control sequences in vivo. These studies reveal the broad application of the Pdx-1, BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 transcription factors in regulating expression of genes selectively expressed in islet β cells. Consensus-binding sites for many transcription factors are relatively non-selective and found at high frequency within the genome. This raises the possibility that factors that are capable of binding to a cis-acting element in vitro and regulating transcription from a transiently transfected plasmid, which would not have higher order chromatin structure, may not occupy this site within the endogenous gene. Closed chromatin structure and competition from another DNA-binding protein with similar nucleotide specificity are two possible mechanisms by which a transcription factor may be excluded from a potential binding sitein vivo. Multiple transcription factors, including Pdx-1, BETA-2, and Pax6, have been implicated in expression of the insulin gene in pancreatic β cells. In this study, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay has been used to show that these factors do, in fact, bind to insulin control region sequences in intact β cells. In addition, another key islet-enriched transcription factor, Nkx2.2, was found to occupy this region using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In vitro DNA-binding and transient transfection assays defined how Nkx2.2 affected insulin gene expression. Pdx-1 was also shown to bind within a region of the endogenous islet amyloid polypeptide, pax-4, and glucokinase genes that were associated with control in vitro. Because Pdx-1 does not regulate gene transcription in isolation, these sequences were examined for occupancy by the other insulin transcriptional regulators. BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 were also found to bind to amyloid polypeptide, glucokinase, andpax-4 control sequences in vivo. These studies reveal the broad application of the Pdx-1, BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 transcription factors in regulating expression of genes selectively expressed in islet β cells. insulin islet amyloid polypeptide chromatin immunoprecipitation chloramphenicol acetyltransferase wildtype mutant Rous sarcoma virus luciferase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase glucokinase Transcription of the insulin (INS)1 gene is restricted to pancreatic islet β cells. The 5′-flanking sequences within 350 base pairs of the transcription start site contain the binding sites for the factors that control cell type-specific expression (1Boam D.S. Clark A.R. Docherty K.

Thus, homozygous loss of Pdx-1 leads to pancreatic agenesis in mice (10Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H.

Islet cell development and function is also affected by other islet-enriched transcription factors (15Edlund H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S5-S9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sander M. German M.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For example, insulin is not made in β cells of mice lacking Nkx2.2 (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this appears to be a rather specific effect as other β cell-enriched markers continue to be expressed (e.g. Pdx-1 and islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). Nkx2.2 and insulin are also co-expressed during embryogenesis, although Nkx2.2 expression is not restricted to β cells in adult islets (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Nkx2.2 regulates insulin gene transcription has not been resolved. Indeed, no direct gene targets have yet been reported for Nkx2.2 in the pancreas. Assays such as in vitro DNA binding, co-transfection of reporter constructs, and transgenic knock-out animals provide evidence for the involvement of a factor in transcriptional control. However, such experiments are indirect measures of regulation and do not account for conditions like competition with other binding proteins in vivo, chromatin structure of the endogenous gene, and cascades of regulatory interactions. In contrast, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (18Crane-Robinson C. Wolffe A.P. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 477-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 19Kuo M. Allis C.D.

Importantly, one can determine the physical association of a specific DNA-binding factor with potential control sequences in intact cells with this assay. This technique has been applied to many experimental systems, including in β cells to examine the in vivo occupancy of control sequences within the pdx-1 gene by Pax6 and HNF3β (21Samaras S.E. Cissell M. Gerrish K. Wright C.V.E. Gannon M. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4702-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), within the glut2 glucose transporter gene by HNF1α (22Boj S.F. Parrizas M. Maestro M.A. Ferrer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14481-14486Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), and within several β cell genes by Pdx-1 (23Chakrabarti S.K.

In this study, the ChIP assay was used to assess the in vivooccupancy of insulin 5′-flanking sequences by Pdx-1, BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2. In addition to directly demonstrating binding of Pdx-1, BETA-2, and Pax6 to these sequences in intact β cells, Nkx2.2 was also found to interact. Analysis of the insulin 5′-flanking region target sequences by gel shift and transfected insulin-driven reporter assays suggests that Nkx2.2 reduces transcription upon binding at −140/−119 bp in β cell lines. Our findings that BETA-2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 bind within the transcription control region of other islet-enriched genes also highlights how the ChIP assay can be used to identify targeted genes. Monolayer cultures of insulin-producing pancreatic β cell lines (βTC-3, HIT T-15 2.2, and MIN6) were maintained as described previously (25Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The −238 WT CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) plasmid contains sequences from −238 to +2 bp of the rat insulin II enhancer/promoter region linked to the CAT reporter gene (26Robinson G.

Construction of the insulin mutant (MT) expression vector, −238 CAT −108,107 MT, has been described (25Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol.

The Nkx2.2-binding element mutant was generated in −238WT CAT using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with an oligonucleotide containing the −133,−132 mutation (5′-CCTAGCACCAGGCccGTGTTTGGAAACTGCAGC-3′; mutated nucleotides are underlined). The LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) was used to transfect 1 μg of the −238 CAT and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV):luciferase (LUC) plasmids. The RSV enhancer-driven LUC expression plasmid, pRSVLUC, was used as a recovery marker. Extracts were prepared 40–48 h after transfection and assayed for LUC (27De Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and CAT (28Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowles D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) enzymatic activity. The CAT activity from the test construct was normalized to RSV-driven LUC activity. Each experiment was carried out at least three times. ChIP assays were performed on βTC-3 cells as described (24Gerrish K. Cissell M.A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47775-47784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Protein A-Sepharose was replaced with protein A/G-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and the following antibodies were used: 1 μl of N-terminal (amino acids 1–75) or C-terminal (amino acids 271–283) Pdx-1 whole rabbit polyclonal antiserum; 20 μl of rabbit polyclonal Pax6 IgG (PRB-278P; Covance, Richmond, CA); 5 μl goat polyclonal BETA2 IgG (sc-1084; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); 25 μl mouse monoclonal Nkx2.2 antibody (74.5A5; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA). Normal rabbit (sc-2027), goat (sc-2028), and mouse (sc-2025) IgG preparations were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; 10 μg of normal IgG from the same species of the experimental antiserum was used as a control. The PCR oligonucleotides used to detect mouse gene control sequences were as follows: INS, (−378) 5′-GGAACTGTGAAACAGTCCAAGG-3′ and (−46) 5′-CCCCCTGGACTTTGCTGTTTG-3′ (these primers amplify both mouse insulin I and II gene sequences); phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK), (−434) 5′-GAGTGACACCTCACAGCTGTGG-3′ and (−96) 5′-GGCAGGCCTTTGGATCATAGCC-3′; IAPP, (−290) 5′-AAGTCACTTCCTTACTGTCAGAC-3′ and (−36) 5′-CAACTTGCTTAGCTCTGTCACCAG-3′; pax-4, (−2015) 5′-GCTGGAATGGCCTTGGCTGGCC-3′ and (−1628) 5′-CCTGGCAGATGGTGGTGGAAGCG-3′; and glucokinase (GK), (−258) 5′-GTGATAGGCACCAAGGCACTGAC-3′ and (−2) 5′-CGGTGCTTCTGTTCCAACCAGG-3′. The PCR cycling parameters were: INS, PCK, IAPP, and GK, 1 cycle of 95 °C/2 min and 28 cycles of 95 °C/30 s, 61 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/30 s; pax-4, 1 cycle of 95 °C/2 min and 30 cycles of 95 °C/30 s, 68 °C/30 s, and 72 °C/30 s. Nuclear extracts were prepared from βTC-3 and MIN6 cells as described previously by Zhaoet al. (25Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to in vitrotranscribe and translate the Nkx2.2 encoding plasmid, pNkx2.2 (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ten μg of nuclear extract protein or 2 μl of in vitro-translated protein was added to the binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 μg poly(dI-dC). The double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions, containing 40 fmol of radiolabeled probe, were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The competitor DNA was added at 10–50-fold molar excess prior to the addition of probe. Anti-Nkx2.2 antibody was pre-incubated with protein at 4 °C for 20 min before adding probe to the binding reaction. The protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was then dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. The ChIP assay was first used to investigate binding of Pdx-1 to 5′-flanking control sequences of the insulin gene in an islet β cell line, βTC-3. Two distinct antibodies to Pdx-1 were used to immunoprecipitate formaldehyde cross-linked chromatin. Insulin 5′-flanking sequences (INS; nucleotides −378/−46) were selectively amplified by PCR from chromatin precipitated by anti-Pdx-1 antisera made to either the N- or C-terminal region, but not from chromatin treated with normal rabbit IgG or in the absence of antiserum (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, Pdx-1 antisera did not immunoprecipitate control sequences from the PCK gene (nucleotides −434/−96), which is not expressed in β cells (Fig. 1 A). Significantly, the amplified region of the mouse PCK promoter contains two TAAT motifs that can compete for Pdx-1 bindingin vitro (data not shown). Thus, although Pdx-1 can bind to both the insulin and PCK control sequences in vitro, the ChIP assay demonstrates that only Pdx-1 interacts with the endogenous insulin gene in β cells. To further characterize the in vivo occupancy of the INS transcription unit, ChIP analysis was performed with antibodies to other potential transcriptional regulators, specifically BETA2 (8Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes and Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and Pax6 (9Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J., Ee, H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes and Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Both anti-BETA2 (Fig. 1 B) and anti-Pax6 (Fig. 1 C) antibodies effectively immunoprecipitated INS control sequences from formaldehyde cross-linked βTC-3 chromatin, but not PCK. Neither the INS nor PCK regulatory region was amplified from chromatin isolated in control immunoprecipitations. Finally, we tested if the endogenous INS promoter is occupied by Nkx2.2, a factor that was proposed to be involved in expression as a result of its dramatic and selective effect on insulin levels in Nkx2.2 null mice (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Nkx2.2 antibodies, but not control reactions, immunoprecipitated INS sequences from βTC-3 cells (Fig. 1 D), whereas the PCK promoter was not immunoprecipitated by anti-Nkx2.2. The same patterns were observed with antisera to Nkx2.2, BETA2, Pdx-1, and Pax6 with MIN6 β cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Nkx2.2, as well as Pdx-1, BETA2, and Pax6, is physically associated with endogenous INS control region sequences in β cell lines. The binding detected in vivo for Pax6 (−317/−311 bp, Ref. 9Sander M. Neubuser A. Kalamaras J., Ee, H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes and Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), Pdx-1 (−201/−196 bp, Ref. 6Peshavaria M. Gamer L. Henderson E. Teitelman G. Wright C.V.E. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, −85/−70 bp, Ref. 5Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), and BETA2 (−100/−91bp, Ref. 8Naya F.J. Stellrecht C.M. Tsai M.J. Genes and Dev. 1995; 9: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) within the insulin gene presumably involves the control sites detected in DNA element gel shift assays. The insulin 5′-flanking region (−378/−46 bp) analyzed in the ChIP studies was found to contain potential Nkx2.2-binding elements at nucleotides −140 to −119 (site 1) and −193 to −172 (site 2) upon comparison to the Nkx2.2 consensus-binding site (29Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalmaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). To determine whether Nkx2.2 binds to these INS elements, gel mobility shift assays were performed with in vitro-translated Nkx2.2 and probes to site 1, site 2, and the consensus element (Fig. 2 B). Two major protein-DNA complexes were commonly formed with each element in the Nkx2.2 and control in vitro-translated reactions (seeasterisk-labeled complexes in Fig. 2 A). Significantly, a unique faster mobility complex was detected in the Nkx2.2 reaction with the INS site 1 and consensus element probes, although not with INS site 2 (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether Nkx2.2 was involved in formation of this faster mobility complex, antiserum specifically raised against this protein was added to the binding reactions. This complex was selectively super-shifted in the reactions performed in the presence of Nkx2.2 with the consensus and site 1 probe (Fig. 2 B). A complex of identical mobility was formed with the INS site 1 probe in βTC-3 and MIN6 β nuclear extracts and was also super-shifted with the anti-Nkx2.2 antibody (Fig. 2 C). In addition, competition assays demonstrated that Nkx2.2 bound effectively to the consensus-binding element and INS site 1 and not to site 2 or a site 1 element with a two base pair mutation in the core-binding sequence (INS site 1 −133,−132 MT) (Fig. 2 D). Collectively, these data indicated that Nkx2.2 binds to site 1 at −140 to −119 bp of the insulin gene in β cells. To understand how Nkx2.2 influences insulin transcription, the −133/−132 mutant of site 1 that disrupted binding was introduced into an insulin enhancer/promoter-driven CAT reporter. The effect on activation was compared with a mutant in the RIPE3b1/C1 activator site at −108/−107 bp and the wildtype −238/+2bp CAT construct in transfected HIT T-15, βTC-3, and MIN6 β cell lines. Regulatory patterns for both the INS site 1 and RIPE3b1/C1 mutated constructs were similar in all three β cell lines. Thus, activation was stimulated 1.8- (HIT T-15), 3.3- (βTC-3), and 1.8- (MIN6) fold in the site 1 mutant and, as expected, reduced in the RIPE3b1 activator-binding site mutant (25Zhao L. Cissell M.A. Henderson E. Colbran R. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10532-10537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). These results suggest that Nkx2.2 functions as a negative regulator of insulin expression in β cell lines. Because β cell-specific expression of the insulin gene appears to be controlled by the combinatorial actions of Pdx-1, BETA2, and Pax6 (30Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 31Ohneda K., Ee, H. German M. Semin. Cell. Dev.

The Pdx-1-specific antibodies were found to selectively immunoprecipitate the control sequences of the IAPP (33Bretherton-Watt D. Gore N. Boam D.S. Biochem.

IAPP and pax-4 control sequences were also immunoprecipitated from βTC-3 cells by anti-BETA2 antibodies but not by control antibodies (Fig. 4 B). These results confirm thein vitro studies that indicated that BETA2 was involved inpax-4 expression (37Smith S.B. Watada H. Scheel D.W. Mrejen C. German M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36910-36919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). BETA2 has also recently been shown to bind to the GK promoter in vivo and stimulate expression (38Moates, J. M., Nanda, S., Cissell, M., and Stein, R. (2002)Diabetes, in pressGoogle Scholar). In addition, antisera to Pax6 (Fig. 4 C) and Nkx2.2 (Fig. 4 D) selectively immunoprecipitated IAPP, GK, andpax-4 control sequences. Interestingly, the pax-4promoter has been shown to contain a mutationally sensitive binding site that may be regulated by a factor in the Nkx2 family (39Xu W. Murphy L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 170: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), although the precise binding protein had not been identified. In sum, these results suggest that Pdx-1, BETA2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 define the core of a β cell-enriched transcription complex. Though assays such as in vitro binding, co-transfection with reporter constructs, and transgenic knock-out animals provide evidence for the involvement of a factor in transcriptional control, they do not prove this directly. This is especially problematic for factors, such as Pdx-1, that recognize relatively non-selective binding sites. The consensus Pdx-1-binding element, TAAT(T/G) (40Miller C.P. McGehee R.E., Jr. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), is expected to occur once in every 512 bp. As control region sequences are often several hundred bases in length, the presence of this motif is not uncommon and would not unequivocally demonstrate Pdx-1 regulation even if it were capable of binding to a cis-acting control element in vitro. Likewise, transfection experiments do not account for the native chromatin structure of endogenous genes, which may preclude physiological regulation by a factor that, nonetheless, can bind in vitro. The ChIP assay combines two highly specific techniques, antibody-specific protein-DNA precipitation and PCR amplification, to demonstrate a physical association between a transcription factor and specific control region sequences in intact cells. The ChIP protocol can establish direct interactions of a transcription factor and a gene that are known to be functionally related and, importantly, can also be used to identify interactions with candidate target genes. Using the ChIP assay, we observed occupancy of insulin 5′-flanking control region sequences in βTC-3 and MIN6 cells by Pdx-1, BETA2, Pax6, and Nkx2.2 (Fig. 1). Our demonstration of Pdx-1 occupancy of insulin control sequences corroborates a recent study that was published while our work was in progress (23Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Though there was evidence to suggest a direct role for Pdx-1 (5Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T.

Genes and Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) in insulin gene expression, it has been unclear whether Nkx2.2 directly or indirectly contributed. Thus, the evidence supporting an involvement was based upon the loss of insulin expression in Nkx2.2 null mice, under circumstances where other β cell markers continued to be expressed (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, a control site for Nkx2.2 within the insulin gene had not been characterized previously. Based on the reported consensus Nkx2.2-binding element (29Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalmaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we have localized an Nkx2.2-binding site between −140 and −119 bp of the insulin gene by in vitro gel shift analysis (Fig. 2). Importantly, this site is mutationally sensitive in transfection assays, indicating that Nkx2.2 binding can affect insulin gene activity (Fig. 3). Collectively, our results demonstrate that Nkx2.2 can directly regulate insulin transcription in β cells. One would have expected that Nkx2.2 would have had a positive effect on insulin transcription from the results of the Nkx2.2 gene ablation studies in mice (17Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Nkx2.2 appears to act as a weak repressor in β cell transfection assays performed with either an insulin enhancer (Fig. 3) or consensus site-driven reporter construct (29Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalmaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Nkx2.2 is also known to function as a transcriptional repressor in the developing central nervous system, a function necessary in cell fate specification in the ventral neural tube (42Muhr J. Andersson E. Persson M. Jessell T.M. Ericson J. Cell. 2001; 104: 861-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Interestingly, structure-function analysis of the Nkx2.2 protein has identified a strong C-terminal transactivation domain whose function is masked by the highly conserved NK2-specific domain (NK2-SD) in βTC-3 cells (29Watada H. Mirmira R.G. Kalmaras J. German M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9443-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As a consequence, it is possible that a co-factor expressed during pancreatic development or a stage-specific protein modification might interfere with the NK2-SD-mediated repressor function of Nkx2.2 and allow it to function as a transcriptional activator during development. In contrast, Nkx2.2 repressor activity would result if β cell lines or mature β cells lack this effector activity. By extension of this reasoning, we presume that Nkx2.2 also inhibitspax-4, GK, and IAPP gene expression upon binding in β cells. Although the Nkx.2.2 regulatory site(s) within these genes has not been defined precisely, it is likely to be found among the consensus-like binding sites within their control region sequences (i.e. pax-4, −1940/−1933 bp, −1876/−1869 bp; GK, −542/−536 bp, −486/−479 bp; IAPP, −325/−319 bp, −286/−280 bp, −267/−261 bp, −146/−140 bp). Having used the ChIP assay to demonstrate binding of Nkx2.2 to several genes expressed in an islet-enriched manner, we extended this study to examine if other key β cell regulatory factors also bound within their regulatory domains. Previously, Pdx-1 had been shown to bind to its own promoter region in the ChIP assay (23Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Gerrish K. Cissell M.A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47775-47784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Two distinct antisera raised against Pdx-1 were found to immunoprecipitate the IAPP and pax-4 control sequences. Each of these regions has been reported to be a target of Pdx-1 function (IAPP, Refs. 34Carty M.D. Lillquist J.S. Peshavaria M. Stein R. Soeller W.C. J. Biol.

Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, whereas we observed a clear interaction of Pdx-1 and the GK gene using antisera to both the N and C termini of Pdx-1, another group was unable to detect this association using a different Pdx-1 antiserum (23Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This difference highlights an important limitation of the ChIP assay, which despite the power of this technique to firmly establish a physical association between a transcription factor and a control region with immunoprecipitating antisera, a negative result does not provide definitive evidence for the lack of such interactions. Another example involves the inability to detect the occupancy of the GLUT2 promoter by Pdx-1 in the ChIP assay (data not shown and Ref. 23Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), despite a great deal of evidence supporting a role in activation (15Edlund H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S5-S9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sander M. German M.S. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 327-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). There are two likely explanations for these negative results. The microenvironment of the GLUT2 control region might preclude the exposure of Pdx-1 antigenic determinants required for immunoprecipitation, possibly due to interactions with adjacent binding proteins. Alternatively, it is possible that Pdx-1 does not directly regulate GLUT2 transcription or does so through elements that are located outside of the analyzed region. Both studies focused on the proximal region of the GLUT2 promoter found to bind Pdx-1 in vitro (data not shown and Ref. 23Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13286-13293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and, as a result of methodological limitations, Pdx-1-GLUT2 interactions that lie at ≥1000 bp away would not have been detected. Interestingly, the Pdx-1, Pax6, BETA2, and Nkx2.2 regulatory factors of the insulin gene were all found to bind in intact β cells to the regulatory control regions of other genes selectively transcribed in islet cells. How each of these factors precisely mediates control within the context of the insulin, pax-4, IAPP, and GK transcription units is still unclear. As islet cell development was so profoundly affected in the null mutants of these factors, the knock-out studies in mice cannot be used to access how each factor controls islet β expression post-natally under normal or stressed states. Our data strongly suggests that Pdx-1, Pax6, BETA2, and Nkx2.2 represent the core components of a transcription complex of an islet-enriched gene, and presumably also contribute in their expression during development.

Chris Wright and Joel Habener for generously providing the N-terminal (amino acids 1–75) and C-terminal (amino acids 271–283) Pdx-1 antiserum, respectively."

Ubiquitin-like proteins are covalently conjugated to cellular proteins and may intersect the ubiquitin-proteasome system via common substrates or reciprocal regulation. To investigate the relationship between ISG15 conjugation and proteasome function, we treated interferon-induced cells with proteasome inhibitors. Surprisingly, inhibition of proteasomal, but not lysosomal, proteases dramatically enhanced the level of ISG15 conjugates. The stimulation of ISG15 conjugates occurred rapidly in the absence of protein synthesis and was most dramatic in the cytoskeletal protein fraction. Inhibition of ISG15 conjugation by ATP depletion abrogated the proteasome inhibitor-dependent increase in ISG15 conjugates, suggesting that the effect was mediated by de novo conjugation, rather than protection from proteasomal degradation or inhibition of ISG15 deconjugating activity. The increase in ISG15 conjugates did not occur through a stabilization of the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBE1L. Furthermore, simultaneous modification of proteins by both ISG15 and ubiquitin did not account for the proteasome inhibitor-dependent increase in ISG15 conjugates. These findings provide the first evidence for a link between ISG15 conjugation and proteasome function and support a model in which proteins destined for ISG15 conjugation are proteasome-regulated.

Ub conjugation is carried out by the concerted activities of E1 (ub activation), E2 (ub conjugation), and E3 (ub ligase) enzymes in an ATP-dependent process (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). Sequential transfer of ub-thiol ester intermediates between ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes results in isopeptide bond formation between the ε-amino group of a substrate lysine residue and the carboxyl-terminal glycine of ub. The conjugated ub substrate can be targeted for further ubiquitylation in which polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 48 are formed. Importantly, ubiquitylation is reversible, as ub can be removed from conjugates through the action of deconjugating enzymes (DUBs) (2Wilkinson K.D. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). DUBs share highly conserved catalytic domains but exhibit great sequence diversity outside of these regions; the heterogeneity of these noncatalytic domains is thought to reflect substrate-specific activity. Thus, ubiquitin conjugation is a dynamic balance between conjugation and deconjugation. In the best characterized outcome of ubiquitylation, proteins conjugated to poly-ub chains of four or greater are targeted for degradation in the 26 S proteasome (3Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The proteasome is composed of two 19 S “cap” complexes that bind, de-ubiquitylate, and unfold substrates to facilitate entry into the barrel-shaped 20 S proteolytic core. Identification of the protease activities of the proteasome as chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like permitted the development of peptide inhibitors of proteasome function. Studies using cell-permeable proteasome inhibitors revealed that the ub-proteasome pathway is responsible for 80–90% of protein turnover in cells and is essential for the regulation of virtually all cellular processes (4Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-like proteins (ubls) are a growing family of proteins that function to post-translationally modify cellular targets in a pathway parallel to, but distinct from, that of ub (5Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Ubls are translated with carboxyl-terminal extensions that are processed to expose residues that function in conjugation; this conjugation sequence is composed of invariant LRGG carboxyl-terminal residues in orthologues of ISG15, Nedd8, and ub (5Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Like ub, ubls form covalent conjugates with cellular proteins that can be reversed by DUB-like enzymes. However, ubl conjugates are not typically targeted for degradation in the proteasome; rather, conjugation to the ubls studied to date modulates the subcellular location, protein interaction, and biochemical activity of substrate proteins (6Yeh E.T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 248: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Recent reports have demonstrated reciprocal regulation by ub and ubl conjugation pathways. For example, the ubl SUMO competes with ub for conjugation to lysine residues on IκB resulting in a stabilizing effect of SUMO conjugation (7Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In two other examples of an intersection between ub and ubl pathways, the ubl NEDD8 and its conjugates are degraded in the proteasome via the adaptor protein NUB1, and SUMO modification of promonocyte leukemia, itself a ub E3 enzyme, recruits the 19 S proteasome subunit to nuclear bodies (8Kamitani T.

Protein modification by ub and ubls is thus emerging as a complex network of post-translational regulation with the capacity to rapidly modulate protein function. ISG15 was among the first interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) to be cloned and is induced independently of IFN, as one of the earliest and strongest responses to microbial challenge (10Blomstrom D.C.

Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like other ubls, ISG15 is translated as a 17-kDa precursor, and the carboxyl-terminal octapeptide extension is rapidly processed by a 100-kDa protease to expose the ISG15 conjugation domain (14Knight E., Jr. Fahey D. Cordova B. Hillman M. Kutny R. Reich N. Blomstrom D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4520-4522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Potter J.L. Narasimhan J. Mende-Mueller L. Haas A.L. J. Biol.

Free ISG15 is induced rapidly following IFN treatment, and high molecular weight ISG15 conjugates appear following a lag of 12–24 h (16Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBE1L, has been identified recently; induction of this enzyme by IFN requires protein synthesis that may account for the lag in conjugate formation (17Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). A candidate ISG15 E2 enzyme, 1-8U, has been identified based on its homology to other E2 enzymes and is a member of a family of interferon-induced genes that are also directly induced by virus and double-stranded RNA (18Pru J.K. Austin K.J. Haas A.L. Hansen T.R. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 1471-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

ISG15 conjugates are dramatically increased in cells from UBP43−/− mice indicating that ISG15 conjugation is a dynamic process and that UBP43 serves a critical function in regulating the cellular conjugate pool. In contrast to the regulation of ISG15 expression and conjugation, little is known about the identity of specific ISG15 conjugates or the functional role of ISG15 conjugation. ISG15 conjugates were reported to localize to intermediate filaments; however, the relationship of this localization to ISG15 function is unclear (23Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Very recently, the protease inhibitor, serpin 2a, was identified as the first ISG15 conjugate; how ISG15 conjugation may modulate the properties of this protein remains to be determined (24Hamerman J.A. Hayashi F. Schroeder L.A. Gygi S.P. Haas A.L. Hampson L. Coughlin P. Aebersold R. Aderem A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2415-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In light of the interactions reported between ub and other ubls, we investigated the potential role of proteasome function in ISG15 conjugation. Surprisingly, proteasome inhibitors dramatically increased the level of ISG15 conjugates in IFN-treated cells. This activity did not reflect an increase in ISG15 expression or the stabilization of ISG15 conjugates from proteasome degradation; rather, the increase in ISG15 conjugates was mediated through de novo conjugation. In addition, the proteasome inhibitor-dependent increase in ISG15 conjugates did not occur through the modulation of UBE1L or UBP43. These findings provide the first evidence of a link between ISG15 conjugation and proteasome function, and support a model in which proteins destined for ISG15 conjugation are regulated in a proteasome-dependent manner. IFN-α2b was obtained from Schering and was used at 1000 units/ml. Proteasome inhibitors were from Calbiochem and used at the following concentrations: MG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO), 20 μm; proteasome inhibitor I (Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO), 50 μm; proteasome inhibitor II (Z-Leu-Leu-Phe-CHO), 20 μm; ALLN (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), 50 μm; and lactacystin, 20 μm. Protease inhibitors (4-amidino-phenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride andN-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucyl]-agmatin), leupeptin (Ac-Leu-Leu-argininal), and the protease inhibitor mixture were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 2-Deoxy-d-glucose, 2,4-dinitrophenol, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and detergents (digitonin, SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 40, and deoxycholate) were from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody to ISG15 (used at 1 μg/ml) was a kind gift from Ernest Borden (Taussig Cancer Center, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). The polyclonal rabbit anti-ubiquitin antibody (used at 2 μg/ml) was generously provided by Arthur L. Haas (Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee). Rabbit anti-actin polyclonal antibody (used at 1:500 dilution) was from Sigma, and the rabbit polyclonal UBE1L antibody (used at 1 μg/ml) was kindly provided by Ethan Dmitrovsky (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH). The protein molecular mass marker set was from Invitrogen. 2fTGH cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator of 5% CO2 (all cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen). For transfections, cells were seeded at 6.3 × 104cells/cm2 and transfected with UBE1L expression vector (kindly provided by Ethan Dmitrovsky, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), or vector lacking insert, using LipofectAMINE reagent as directed by the supplier (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were harvested at the times indicated in figure legends. Cells were treated as described in figure legends, and total cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). The protein concentration in cell lysates was determined by the Bradford microassay (Bio-Rad), and 100 μg of lysate protein was separated on 7.5 and 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for analysis of UBE1L and ISG15, respectively. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for 30 min at room temperature and then sequentially reacted to the primary antibody for 30 min in blocking buffer and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Sigma). The immunoreactive complex was visualized by the Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposure to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The bound antibodies were stripped from blots by incubation in 0.2 m NaOH for 5 min. Cytosolic/membrane, cytoskeleton-associated/nuclear, and cytoskeletal protein fractions were prepared as described previously (25Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Khairallah E.A. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2fTGH cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of buffer A (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 0.01% digitonin and 0.5% Triton X-100, and placed on ice for 30 min. The extraction mix was centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant containing the cytosolic/membrane fraction was collected, and the pellet was then resuspended by vortexing in buffer A supplemented with 1% Tween 40 and 0.5% deoxycholate for 5 s. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min; the supernatant was collected and represented the nuclear/cytoskeleton-associated protein fraction. The insoluble pellet represented the cytoskeletal fraction and was resuspended in 1× sample buffer (0.12 m Tris/HCl, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.36 m β-mercaptoethanol). 4× sample buffer was added to all samples to give a 1× final concentration and was incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min prior to loading on the gel. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, and 1 mg of protein was incubated for 30 min on ice with 20 μl protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a total volume of 1 ml. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to preclear the lysate of any proteins that nonspecifically bound to the matrix. The supernatant was incubated with ISG15 monoclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml for 1 h on ice and then 20 μl of protein A/G plus-agarose was added to the immune complexes for an additional 1 h on ice. The bound proteins were pelleted at 1000 × gfor 5 min and washed with RIPA buffer three times. The final pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of 1× sample buffer and were boiled for 5 min prior to loading on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Post-translational modification by ubls including SUMO and NEDD8 can intersect the ubiquitin pathway resulting in agonistic or antagonistic effects on the activity of conjugating enzymes or substrate half-life (7Desterro J.M.

Information on this reciprocal regulation between ub and ubl pathways provides important insights into the biologic functions of ubl conjugation. To determine whether the ISG15 conjugation pathway was modulated by proteasome function, IFN-α-induced 2fTGH cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. We have determined previously that the simultaneous treatment with IFN-α and proteasome inhibitor blocks IFN-stimulated signal transduction and the induction of ISGs (28Li X.L. Hassel B.A. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this study, we wanted to examine specifically the role of proteasome function on existing ISG15 conjugates; therefore, a regimen in which cells were first treated with IFN-α to induce ISG15 conjugates and then treated with proteasome inhibitor was employed. All proteasome inhibitor treatments were for 6 h or less and did not result in cell toxicity (Refs. 4Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar,28Li X.L. Hassel B.A. Cytokine. 2001; 14: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, and data not shown). IFN treatment induced a high level of ISG15 conjugates in 2fTGH cells as detected by Western blot. Remarkably, addition of MG132 resulted in a further 16-fold increase in ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 1). The stimulation of ISG15 conjugates by proteasome inhibitor was also observed in fibrosarcoma (HT1080), lung carcinoma (A549), and promonocytic (THP-1) cell lines indicating that it was a general response of IFN-treated cells to proteasome inhibitor (data not shown). 2fTGH cells, an HT1080-derived cell line (29Rasheed S. Nelson-Rees W.A. Toth E.M. Arnstein P. Gardner M.B. Cancer. 1974; 33: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), exhibited a high level of ISG15 conjugation in response to IFN, and ISG15 conjugates were further increased by MG132 treatment; therefore, subsequent analyses employed this cell line. The increase in ISG15 conjugates occurred in the absence of any significant change in free ISG15, suggesting that an alteration of ISG15 gene expression was not involved (also see Fig. 4below). Levels of the constitutively expressed α-actin protein did not change in response to IFN-α and MG132 indicating that this treatment did not result in a global change in protein expression (Fig. 1, lower panel). Interestingly, a decrease in free ISG15 corresponding to the increase in ISG15 conjugates was not observed; this finding likely reflects the limitations of signal quantification by the Western blot analysis employed here. Specifically, an increase in ISG15 conjugates is readily detectable due to the fact that the substrates are heterogeneous in size and the signal is spread over a range of molecular masses; in contrast, the small decrease in the induced pool of free ISG15 that gives rise to these conjugates may not be discernible as a reduction in the signal from the single 15-kDa ISG15 band. Some conjugate species were more dramatically enhanced by proteasome inhibitor treatment (see bands marked with arrowsin Fig. 1); however, all of the conjugate species observed in MG132-treated cells could also be detected in cells treated with IFN alone following a longer, 30 min, exposure of the Western blot (data not shown). Thus, proteasome inhibition appeared to effect a quantitative rather than a qualitative increase in ISG15 conjugates.Figure 4The proteasome inhibitor-dependent increase in ISG15 conjugates is rapid and does not require protein synthesis. 2fTGH cells were treated with 1000 units/ml IFN-α for 24 h, followed by the addition of cycloheximide (CHX) (50 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of MG132 (20 μm) for the indicated times. Free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates in 100 μg of whole cell lysate were detected by Western blot (upper panel). The blot was stripped and reacted with anti-actin antibody to show equivalent protein loading (lower panel). The migration of molecular mass markers,M, is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MG132 is a peptide aldehyde inhibitor of chymotrypsin-like proteasomal proteases with nonspecific activity against calpains and certain lysosomal cysteine proteases (30Rock K.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that the proteasome was the MG132 target that mediated the increase in ISG15 conjugates, IFN-induced cells were treated with distinct proteasome inhibitors, including the highly proteasome-specific inhibitor, lactacystin, and inhibitors of lysosomal and cellular proteases. All inhibitors employed were cell-permeable, thus access to intracellular targets was not a limiting factor (32Iizuka K. Kawaguchi H. Kitabatake A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1993; 25: 1101-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Libby P. Goldberg A.L. Science. 1978; 199: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of ISG15 conjugates in cells treated with these inhibitors revealed that compounds that blocked proteasome activity, but not inhibitors of other proteolytic pathways, resulted in an increase in ISG15 conjugates (Fig. 2). An identical pattern of ISG15 conjugates and a similar magnitude of conjugate stimulation were observed in response to distinct proteasome inhibitors, indicating that proteasome inhibition by multiple independent mechanisms results in a similar effect on ISG15 conjugates. These results provide the first evidence of a link between proteasome function and ISG15 conjugation. Analysis of ISG15 conjugates in total cell lysates revealed that certain conjugate species are increased more dramatically than others following treatment with proteasome inhibitor. A subset of ISG15 conjugates is tightly associated with the intermediate filament network of the cytoskeleton, suggesting that distinct conjugate pools are localized to specific cellular compartments (23Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine whether proteasome-sensitive ISG15 conjugates are associated with a particular subcellular fraction, differential extraction was employed. Lysates containing cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, nuclear and soluble cytoskeletal proteins, and insoluble cytoskeletal proteins were prepared from 8 × 105 IFN-induced cells treated with or without MG132. The differential detergent fractionation method employed here was previously demonstrated to efficiently separate proteins found in these subcellular compartments (25Ramsby M.L. Makowski G.S. Khairallah E.A. Electrophoresis. 1994; 15: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cytoplasmic protein tubulin was detected by Western blot in the cytosolic/membrane fraction with little or no contaminating protein found in the other fractions (Fig. 3 C). The most striking MG132-stimulated increase in ISG15 conjugates was observed in the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction, in which a predominantly high molecular weight population of conjugates was detectable only following MG132 treatment (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, no free ISG15 was found in the insoluble cytoskeletal fraction; in contrast, ISG15 in the soluble cytoskeletal and nuclear protein fraction was almost exclusively free, with conjugates barely detectable. Both free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates were previously found to associate with the cytoskeleton by immunofluorescence staining (23Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8408-8419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); thus it is likely that the free ISG15 in the soluble cytoskeletal and nuclear protein fraction is derived from ISG15 that is loosely associated with the cytoskeleton. The cytosolic and membrane protein fraction contained both free ISG15 and an MG132-stimulated conjugate population (Fig. 3 A). To compare the distribution of ub conjugates following MG132 treatment with that observed for ISG15, the blot in Fig. 3 A was reacted with anti-ub antibody. The monoclonal ISG15 antibody reacts specifically with free ISG15 and ISG15 conjugates; however, the polyclonal ub antibody exhibits cross-reactivity primarily to free ISG15 and, to a lesser degree, with ISG15 conjugates (13Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34D'Cunha J. Ramanujam S. Wagner R.J. Witt P.L. Knight E., Jr. Borden E.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4100-4108PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, free ISG15 is detected by ub antibody in IFN-treated cells (Fig. 3 B and Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). A minor population of ub conjugates that loosely associated with the cytoskeleton was detected; however, similar to ISG15, the most dramatic MG132-stimulated increase in ub conjugates was observed in a population that is tightly associated with the cytoskeletal fraction. MG132 treatment also increased ub conjugates in the cytosolic and membrane fraction. These results suggest that cytoskeleton is an important site for proteasome function and ISG15 conjugation.Figure 5De novo ISG15 conjugation is required for the proteasome inhibitor-stimulated increase in conjugates. 2fTGH cells were treated with 1000 units/ml IFN-α for 24 h, followed by the addition of 20 μm MG132 alone or in combination with the ATP-depleting agents (20 mm 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), 0.2 mm2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP)) for an additional 6 h.A, free ISG15 and conjugates were detected by Western blot.

To define the role of p0071 in junction assembly, p0071 was tested for interactions with other components of the endothelial junctional complex. In transient expression assays, p0071 colocalized with and formed complexes with both VE-cadherin and desmoplakin. Deletion analysis using the yeast two-hybrid system revealed that the armadillo repeat domain of p0071 bound directly to VE-cadherin. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that p0071 and p120 bound to the same region on the cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin and that overexpression of p0071 could displace p120 from intercellular junctions. In contrast to VE-cadherin, desmoplakin was found to associate with the non-armadillo head domain of p0071. Cotransfections and triple-label immunofluorescence analysis revealed that VE-cadherin colocalization with desmoplakin in transfected COS cells required p0071, suggesting that p0071 may couple VE-cadherin to desmoplakin. Based on previous findings that both VE-cadherin and desmoplakin play central roles in vasculogenesis, these new results suggest that p0071 may play an important role in endothelial junction assembly and in the morphogenic events associated with vascular remodeling. p0071, a member of the armadillo protein family, localizes to both adherens junctions and desmosomes in epithelial cells and exhibits homology to the adherens junction protein p120 and the desmosomal protein plakophilin-1. p0071 is also present at dermal microvascular endothelial intercellular junctions and colocalizes with VE-cadherin, an endothelium-specific cadherin that associates with both actin and intermediate filament networks.

Vascular endothelial cells form a continuous cell layer along the wall of blood vessels and participate in a wide range of biological processes that regulate vascular function. One important function of the endothelial lining is to control the movement of solutes and fluid from the vascular space to the tissues (1Lum H. Malik A.B. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1996; 74: 787-800PubMed Google Scholar, 2Stevens T. Garcia J.G. Shasby D.M. Bhattacharya J. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L419-L422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of cell adhesion between endothelial cells results in tissue edema, inflammation, and poor wound healing. In addition, these cell-cell contacts also function as plasma membrane attachment sites for cytoskeletal networks, such as actin and intermediate filaments, thereby influencing cell shape and tissue integrity (3Kowalczyk A.P.

It is now apparent that intercellular junctions are macromolecular complexes that integrate informational cues derived from cell adhesion events with intracellular signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, apoptosis, and gene expression (6Klymkowsky M.W. Parr B. Cell. 1995; 83: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Barth A.I. Nathke I.S. Nelson W.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which adhesive interactions are established between vascular endothelial cells have been studied extensively (8Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express a unique cadherin, VE-cadherin (where VE is vascular endothelial; cadherin-5), which plays a central role in the establishment and maintenance of endothelial monolayer integrity and angiogenesis (9Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 10Liao F., Li, Y. O'Connor W. Zanetta L. Bassi R. Santiago A. Overholser J. Hooper A. Mignatti P. Dejana E. Hicklin D.J. Bohlen P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6805-6810PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, endothelial cells assemble unique junctional complexes that couple VE-cadherin to both actin and intermediate filament networks (11Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the precise nature of these protein interactions remains only partially characterized. Like other classical cadherins such as E-cadherin, VE-cadherin associates with the cytoplasmic proteins β-catenin and plakoglobin, members of the armadillo protein family (12Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Caveda L. Breviario F. Ayalon O. Geier B. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Both plakoglobin and β-catenin bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin, thus providing a link to the actin cytoskeleton through their association with α-catenin, a vinculin homolog that plays a key role in linking the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, plakoglobin (but not β-catenin) provides a link from VE-cadherin to the intermediate filament network by recruiting desmoplakin, an intermediate filament-binding protein, to intercellular junctions (11Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Desmoplakin, a member of the plakin family of cytoskeletal cross-linking proteins, is an abundant constituent of the desmosomal plaque and functions to couple intermediate filaments to membrane-associated adhesive junctions (13Leung C.L.

Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 37-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of desmoplakin interacts directly with intermediate filament networks (15Stappenbeck T.S. Green K.J. J.

In addition to playing fundamental roles in desmosome assembly and epidermal integrity (24Vasioukhin V. Bowers E. Bauer C. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), desmoplakin also plays important roles in adherens junction formation (24Vasioukhin V. Bowers E. Bauer C. Degenstein L. Fuchs E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 1076-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25Hatsell S. Cowin P. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: E270-E272Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Interestingly, vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, which do not assemble true desmosomes, also express desmoplakin (26Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 274-289PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schmelz M. Moll R. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In cultured human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and primary dermal microvascular endothelial cells, desmoplakin was shown to localize to intercellular junctions (11Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Valiron O. Chevier V. Usson Y. Breviario F. Job D. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies also indicate that desmoplakin plays an important role in vasculogenesis (29Gallicano G.I. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Development. 2001; 128: 929-941PubMed Google Scholar), underscoring the need to determine how desmoplakin interacts with other components of endothelial intercellular junctions. An exciting development over the last several years is the realization that intercellular junctions contain a newly identified subset of armadillo family proteins termed the p120/plakophilin subfamily (30Hatzfeld M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 186: 179-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In general, p120 assembles into actin-associated adherens junctions, whereas the plakophilins assemble into intermediate filament-based desmosomes. Interestingly, one member of the subfamily (termed p0071) assembles into both adherens junctions and desmosomes (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This dual targeting of p0071 to both types of junctions raises the possibility that p0071 plays a role in the molecular cross-talk that occurs between different intercellular junctions, thus influencing a range of cellular events that are regulated by either the actin or intermediate filament cytoskeleton. To understand how p0071 might perform specific roles in junction assembly, we initiated an investigation into the subcellular localization of p0071 in dermal microvascular endothelial cells. In addition, we tested p0071 for interactions with other intercellular junction proteins using transient transfection of COS-7 and 293 cells, co-immunoprecipitation, and yeast two-hybrid analysis. The data indicate that p0071 associates with both adherens junction and desmosomal proteins and that p0071 is a cadherin- and desmoplakin-binding protein. A cDNA construct encoding full-length human p0071 was generated as described previously (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and subcloned into theNotI site of the pKS vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Expression in eukaryotic cells was performed with the FLAG-tagged expression system pCMV-Tag4 or pCMV-Tag2 vector, containing a carboxyl- or an amino-terminal FLAG epitope, respectively (Stratagene). p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG was constructed using the 3.0-kbNotI/SalI fragment from the pKS vector containing the p0071 insert and subcloned into pCMV-Tag4. Similarly, p0071-(1–553)-FLAG was generated from a 1.8-kbNotI/PstI fragment and subcloned into pCMV-Tag4. p0071-(554–1016)-FLAG was generated from a 1.8-kbPstI/SalI fragment and subcloned into the pCMV-Tag2 vector. To generate full-length FLAG-tagged p0071 (p0071-(1–1192)-FLAG), a point mutation was introduced to eliminate the stop codon using the primer pair 5′-GAC TCA TGG GTG GCG GAT CAA GCT TCC CAA CAG AGG and 5′-CCT CTG TTG GGA AGC TTG ATC CGC CAC CCA TGA GTC and the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting 3.5-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment was subcloned into the pCMV-Tag4 vector. The p0071-(1–508)-FLAG construct was generated by PCR using a p0071 5′-primer (5′-CGC GGATCC AGA GGA ATG CCA GCT CCT GAG CAG GCC), which generates a BamHI site (underlined) at the 5′-end of p0071-(1–508)-FLAG, and the p0071-(1–508)-FLAG 3′-primer (5′-TTT AAC GTCGAC CTA CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC GGT GCC ATC ATC AGC CGG CAC), which generates the FLAG tag (italicized) and a 3′-SalI site (underlined). p0071-(509–992)-FLAG was also generated using a p0071 5′-primer (5′-CGC GGATCC AGA GGA ATG ACA AGA TCC CCA TCA ATA GAC), which generates a BamHI site (underlined) at the 5′-end of the construct, and the p0071-(509–992)-FLAG 3′-primer (5′-CCG CTCGAGCTA CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CCA TAA TGT ATT CAA GAC CTG GGC), which generates the FLAG tag (italicized) and a 3′-XhoI site (underlined). p0071-(992–1192)-FLAG was generated by PCR using a p0071 5′-primer (5′-CGC GGATCC AGA GGA ATG CAA TAT CGG GAC CTC CGG AGC), which generates a BamHI site (underlined) at the 5′-end of p0071-(992–1192)-FLAG, and the p0071-(992–1192)-FLAG 3′ primer (5′-CCG CTCGAG CTA CTT ATC GTC GTC ATC CTT GTA ATC CAC CCA TGA GTC TGG GGA CCC), which generates a FLAG tag (italicized) and a 3′-XhoI site (underlined). The PCR products were subcloned into donor vectors of the Creator system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), and PCR-generated regions were sequenced to verify that errors were not introduced into the coding sequence. Expression of all constructs was further verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. A diagram illustrating the different domains of the recombinant proteins used in this work is shown in Fig. 1. Full-length cDNA encoding human VE-cadherin, subcloned into the pECE vector using the SV40 promoter, was generated as described previously (9Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I.

The cDNA clone encoding the cytoplasmic domain of human VE-cadherin was generated by PCR as described previously (34Venkiteswaran K. Xiao K. Summers S. Calkins C.C. Vincent P.A. Pumiglia K.

The cytoplasmic domain was recovered from the TA vector (Invitrogen) by restriction digestion withEcoRI/XhoI and subcloned into the Creator system donor vector. To generate the triple-alanine mutation in the VE-cadherin juxtamembrane domain (E652A/M653A/D654A), we used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit and the primer pair 5′-GAG GGC GGC GGC GCG GCG GCC ACC ACC AGC TAC G and 5′-CGT AGC TGG TGG TGG CCG CCG CGC CGC CGC CCT C. cDNAs encoding full-length desmoplakin with a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag, the first 584 amino acids of desmoplakin (DPNTP, for desmoplakinN-terminal polypeptide) (35Bornslaeger E.A.

Yeast two-hybrid vectors encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (pLP-GBK) or transcription activation domain (pLP-GAD) were purchased from Clontech. The p0071 constructs described above were subcloned from the Creator system donor vector into the Creator system acceptor vector pLP-GBK. The VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain was subcloned into the Creator system donor vector, followed by recombination subcloning into the acceptor vector pLP-GAD. All constructs were then verified by sequencing. To assay for interactions between proteins, 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA was transformed into the yeast strain AH109 (Clontech) using LiAc, and double transformants were selected by growth in the absence of leucine and tryptophan. Expression of the HIS andADE reporter genes was analyzed by monitoring colony growth on plates lacking histidine, adenine, leucine, and tryptophan. The monkey kidney cell line COS-7 and the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Invitrogen). Primary cultures of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were purchased from the Emory Skin Diseases Research Center (Core B) and cultured in MDCB131 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml cAMP (Sigma), 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (36Muller W.A. Giambrone M.A., Jr. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2389-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For transient transfection experiments, a subclone of COS-7 cells (COS-7-20) was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. The cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence analysis after 24–48 h. The distribution of p0071 in microvascular endothelial cells and transiently transfected COS-7 cells was analyzed by immunofluorescence. Cells grown on coverslips were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 4 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by permeabilization in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. VE-cadherin was monitored using mouse anti-cadherin-5 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Desmoplakin was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody NW6, directed against the desmoplakin carboxyl-terminal domain (37Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the Myc epitope tag (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). Endogenous p0071 was analyzed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), whereas FLAG-tagged p0071 was detected by an anti-FLAG tag monoclonal antibody (Stratagene). Appropriate species cross-absorbed secondary antibodies conjugated to rhodamine, fluorescein, or various Alexa Fluors (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) were used for dual-label immunofluorescence. Control experiments were carried out routinely to verify that fluorescence was not due to secondary antibody cross-reactivity. A Leica DMR-E fluorescence microscope equipped with narrow band-pass filters and a Hamamatsu Orca camera was used. Images were captured and processed using Open Lab software (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (19Kowalczyk A.P. Bornslaeger E.A.

Briefly, cells were scraped into Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100, vortexed, and subjected to centrifugation at 14,000 × g. Antibody M2 (directed against the FLAG tag) conjugated to agarose beads (Sigma) was incubated with the cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were captured by centrifugation, and the beads were washed four times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min with gentle rotation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were released by incubation in reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer at 95 °C and then separated on 7.5% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose according to standard protocols. Membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence reagent (AmershamBiosciences). The precise localization of p0071 in different cell types and the mechanisms by which p0071 incorporates into junctions have been only partially characterized. p0071 has been shown previously to localize at cell-cell contacts in epithelial compartments of various tissues (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38Schroder R. van der Ven P.F. Warlo I. Schumann H. Furst D.O. Blumcke I. Schmidt M.C. Hatzfeld M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 577-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and was found to be expressed and assembled into intercellular junctions of a variety of cultured epithelial cell lines, including HeLa, A431, and HaCaT (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Using previously characterized antibodies specific for p0071 (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the distribution of p0071 was examined and compared with that of VE-cadherin in cultured primary human microvascular endothelial cells. In confluent monolayers of primary microvascular endothelial cells, p0071 localized at intercellular junctions (Fig. 2 A) and colocalized with VE-cadherin (Fig. 2, C and D). These results are consistent with previous studies indicating that p0071 is broadly expressed and assembled into intercellular junctions in a variety of cell types and tissues (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The localization of p0071 at cell-cell borders suggested that this protein may interact with other components within the intercellular junctions of microvascular endothelial cells, such as VE-cadherin. To begin the analysis of p0071 binding partners, a FLAG-tagged p0071 construct (p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG) was generated. When expressed in COS-7 cells, the p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG protein localized to both the cytoplasm and intercellular junctions (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether p0071 interacts with VE-cadherin, p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG was cotransfected with VE-cadherin (Fig. 3, C and D). p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG (Fig. 3 C) and VE-cadherin (Fig. 3 D) exhibited extensive colocalization, primarily at cell-cell borders. Moreover, in cells coexpressing p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG and VE-cadherin, p0071 recruitment to intercellular junctions was dramatically increased. The central armadillo domain of p0071, but not the non-armadillo head domain, colocalized with VE-cadherin when cotransfected into COS-7 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the armadillo domain of p0071 binds to VE-cadherin. To test for direct interactions between p0071 and VE-cadherin, full-length p0071 and the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin were examined for direct binding using the yeast two-hybrid system. Direct interactions between proteins were assayed by growth in the absence of histidine and adenine (Fig. 3 E). In agreement with the COS-7 cell transient transfection assays, growth in the absence of histidine and adenine was consistently observed when yeast were cotransformed with plasmids encoding p0071 in the DNA-binding domain vector and the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain in the transcription activation domain vector (Fig. 3 E). Similar results were obtained using β-galactosidase as a reporter for direct interactions (data not shown), indicating that p0071 and VE-cadherin are direct binding partners. To further define the domain of p0071 that binds to VE-cadherin, deletion mutants of p0071 (p0071-(1–508), p0071-(509–992), and p0071-(324–1192)) were generated and analyzed for the ability to bind to the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 3 E). The results indicate that the central armadillo domain of p0071 (amino acids 509–992) is necessary and sufficient for binding to the cytoplasmic domain of VE-cadherin. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that, like the related proteins ARVCF (a rmadillo repeat gene deleted in velo cardiofacial syndrome), δ-catenin, and p120, p0071 is a cadherin-binding protein. Recent studies have identified a core region within the juxtamembrane domain of E-cadherin responsible for binding to the armadillo protein p120 (39Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The juxtamembrane domain sequence is highly conserved among type I and II classical cadherins (31Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether p0071 and p120 compete for binding sites at cell-cell junctions, full-length FLAG-tagged p0071 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope tag to detect exogenously expressed p0071 along with antibodies directed against endogenous p120. In untransfected cells, p120 was detected in a continuous pattern along cell-cell contacts (Fig. 4, Aand B). In contrast, p120 staining was dramatically reduced at the borders of adjacent cells expressing the FLAG-tagged p0071 protein (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that p0071 occupies membrane-binding sites in a mutually exclusive manner with p120. To determine whether p0071 and p120 bind to the same region of VE-cadherin, a triple-alanine substitution at residues 652–654 of the VE-cadherin juxtamembrane domain was generated and tested for the ability to bind to plakoglobin, p0071, or p120 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Protein-protein interactions were monitored by growth in the absence of histidine and adenine. Although plakoglobin bound to the mutated VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, neither p0071 (Fig. 4 E) nor p120 (data not shown) interacted with the mutated cytoplasmic tail of VE-cadherin. Similar results were obtained when full-length VE-cadherin with the E652A/M653A/D654A mutation was expressed in COS-7 cells; the VE-cadherin mutant failed to colocalize with p0071 as observed by dual-label immunofluorescence (data not shown). These data indicate that p0071 binds to the juxtamembrane domain of VE-cadherin and that it may compete with p120 for binding to this highly conserved region of cadherins. Vascular endothelial cells assemble unique intercellular junctions that are thought to couple VE-cadherin not only to actin microfilaments, but also to the vimentin intermediate filament cytoskeleton. Several studies have demonstrated that the intermediate filament-binding protein desmoplakin is expressed in endothelial cells and assembled into endothelial intercellular junctions (26Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 274-289PubMed Google Scholar, 27Schmelz M. Moll R. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, desmoplakin and VE-cadherin have been shown to co-assemble into intercellular junctions of cultured endothelial cells (11Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Valiron O. Chevier V. Usson Y. Breviario F. Job D. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and recent studies indicate that desmoplakin plays a central role in blood vessel formation during development (29Gallicano G.I. Bauer C. Fuchs E. Development. 2001; 128: 929-941PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these previous reports and on the observation that p0071 localizes to both adherens junctions and desmosomes (32Hatzfeld M. Nachtsheim C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), p0071 was tested for interactions with desmoplakin. p0071-(1–1016)-FLAG and full-length Myc-tagged desmoplakin were coexpressed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 5).

The coding sequence for HMMP13 is 86% identical to rat matrix metalloproteinases-13 (RMMP13); however, the regulation of HMMP13 and RMMP13 protein synthesis in renal mesangial cells is strikingly different. In human cells there is a discordance between HMMP13 mRNA levels and protein expression. Following IL-1β or TGF-β1 stimulation, HMMP13 mRNA levels increase significantly, whereas the protein expression is absent. This discordance is because of a species-dependent translational repression. In addition to the 3′-untranslated region of the matrix metalloproteinases-13 (MMP13) gene, the differential expression of an alternatively spliced transcript of the RNA-binding protein TIAR in human cell cultures is also critical for this post-transcriptional regulation. Transient expression of the 17-amino acid insert of the alternatively spliced form of TIAR reverses the HMMP13 mRNA silencing observed in human and primate species. In addition, co-transfection of the alternatively spliced form of TIAR and HMMP13 into Rat2 cells suppresses HMMP13 protein expression.

Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3890) Google Scholar). It is also clear that MMPs influence many cellular functions, such as migration, proliferation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis (2Vu Th Werb Z. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2123-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Currently 20 distinct human MMPs have been described, of which 14 are secreted extracellular proteinases and 6 are membrane-type MMPs. MMP-13, together with MMP-1 and MMP-8, constitute the interstitial collagenase subfamily (3McCawley L.J. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). HMMP13 was initially identified in fibrosing breast cancer (4Freije J.M. Diez-Itza I. Balbin M. Sanchez L.M. Blasco R. Tolivia J. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16766-16773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HMMP13 has a wide substrate specificity, and its expression is limited to pathological situations in which rapid and effective remodeling of collagenous ECM is required (5Werb Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 439-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar, 6Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Clin.

High levels of expression of HMMP13 have been documented in certain cancers that are aggressive and invasive, and HMMP13 can serve as a prognostic marker of tumor progression in a specific subset of cancers (8Brinckerhoff C.E. Rutter J.L. Benbow U. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 4823-4830PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have documented the transcriptional regulation of HMMP13 in several cell lines (9Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10Ravanti L. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37292-37300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The HMMP13 gene can be either up-regulated or down-regulated by a number of cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. For example, HMMP13 expression was induced in chondrocytes by IL-1β and in human gingival fibroblasts by TGF-β. In contrast, IFN-γ inhibited HMMP13 expression inras-transformed human keratinocytes (11Ala-aho R.F. Johansson N.F. Grenman R.F. Fusenig N.E. Lopez-Otin C.F. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recent work has also shown that the RMMP13 transcript is stabilized by cortisol (12Delany A.M. Jeffrey J.J. Rydziel S. Canalis E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26607-26612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or alendronate (13Varghese S. Canalis E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2345-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and destabilized by TGF-β in osteoblast cells (14Rydziel S. Varghese S. Canalis E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 170: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The change in message stability was mediated by adenine- and uridine-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the RMMP13 mRNA. However, our understanding of the mechanisms for regulation of HMMP13 expression is far from complete (15Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3239) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR of certain genes can specifically control the nuclear export, polyadenylation status, subcellular targeting, and rates of translation or degradation of transcripts (16Conne B.F. Stutz A.F. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The AREs found in the 3′-UTR of mRNA are one of the most prevalent and best studied elements (17Mendell J.T. Dietz H.C. Cell. 2001; 107: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). They play important roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of several genes involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis, including COX-2 (18Dixon D.A. Tolley N.D. King P.H. Nabors L.B. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), iNOS (19Rodriguez-Pascual F. Hausding M. Ihrig-Biedert I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. Forstermann U. Kleinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26040-26049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and TNF-α (20Brewer G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: F1-F4Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For example, in mice with a targeted disruption of the AREs from TNF-α mRNA, the animals developed chronic inflammatory arthritis and Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease due to increased TNF-α synthesis (21Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the HMMP13 gene undergoes a species-dependent translational silencing in human and primate cell cultures. This post-transcriptional regulation requires the participation of the 3′-UTR of the transcripts and is affected by the expression of a peptide corresponding to the alternatively spliced form of TIAR, namely TIAR-a. Unless indicated, all reagents used for biochemical methods were purchased from Sigma, VWR, or Fisher. Restriction enzymes, DNA Polymerase I large fragment (Klenow), DNase I, and alkaline phosphatases were all obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. The pcDNA3 vector, cell culture medium, and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Human recombinant IL-1β, TGF-β1, and TNF-α were all purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human mesangial cells were purchased from Clonetics (CC-2599) and grown in supplied mesangial cell growth medium (MsGM BulletKit, CC-3146) that contained 5% fetal bovine serum with 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 0.05 μg/ml amphotericin B. Rat primary mesangial cell cultures were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (22Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F634-F641PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.6% (v/v) insulin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 15 mm HEPES. Where indicated, mesangial cells were stimulated with IL-1β (100units/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), or TNF-α (20 ng/ml). All experiments were performed with confluent cells and used at passages 3–8. HEK293 (CRL1573), COS-7 (CRL1651), and Rat2 (CRL1764) cells were all from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transient transfections were performed using cells at 70–80% confluency. To test the expression of MMP13 message, total RNA was isolated from cells using RNA STAT-60 reagent, DNase-treated, and reverse-transcribed by Omniscript reverse transcriptase (Qiagen, Inc.) using Oligo (dT) 15 primers. The PCR amplifications were carried out using human MMP13 amplification primers, 5′-CCCCAACCCTAAACATCCAAAAAC-3′ and 5′-CTTCCCCTACCCCG-CACTTCT-3′, and rat MMP13 amplification primers, 5′-TGATGGGCCTTCTG-GTCTTCT-3′ and 5′-AGGTCTCGGGATGGATGCT-3′. To quantify HMMP13 mRNA levels, TaqMan real-time PCR was performed using gene-specific primers and the double-stranded DNA-binding dye, SYBR green I. Fluorescence was detected with an ABI Prism 5700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems). HMMP13 amplification primers were 5′-TGAGCTGGACTCATTGTCGG-3′ and 5′-GATTCCCGCGAGA-TTTGTAGG-3′. Amplification primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH) were 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′. Primer pairs were tested to ensure a robust amplification signal of the expected size with no additional bands. The amount of HMMP13 message in each RNA sample was quantified and normalized to GAPDH content. Relative amounts of HMMP13 cDNA were calculated by the comparative CT method. MMP13 expression vectors were made by cloning the RT-PCR-amplified human MMP13 coding region (HCR), human MMP13 3′-UTR (HUTR), and rat MMP13 3′-UTR (RUTR) into pcDNA3. Briefly, after first-strand synthesis, cDNAs encoding HCR, HUTR, and RUTR were generated by PCR using appropriate primers and then cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen). HCR forward primer was 5′-ATTCAAGATGCATCCAGGGGTC-3′ and reverse primer was 5′-CACTTAAC-ACCACAAAATGGAATTTG-3′. HUTR primers were 5′-CAAATTCCATTTTGT-GGTGTTAAGTG-3′ and 5′-TAAACAACATAAACACTTCCTAATACACTTTG-3′. RUTR primers were 5′-CGAATTCCTTATTGTGGTGTTAAACA-3′ and 5′-GAAACAACATAAGCACAGTGTAACAC-3′. HCR was subcloned from pCR2.1 into pcDNA3 using restriction enzymeEcoRI to get HMMP13-HCR. The HUTR were excised from pCR2.1 using BstXI (filled in with Klenow) and EcoRV, then ligated into HMMP13-HCR by using EcoRV andNotI (filled in with Klenow) to generate HMMP13-HFL. The RUTR were excised from pCR2.1 using BamHI (filled in with Klenow) and NotI and inserted into HMMP13-HCR by usingNotI and XbaI (filled in with Klenow) to obtain HMMP13-HCRU. The FLAG-TIARa and FLAG-TIARb constructs were generated by cloning the RT-PCR-amplified human TIAR-a (1185 bp) orTIAR-b (1134 bp) gene into pcDNA3/FLAG expression vector (Invitrogen). The forward primer was 5′-ACCATGATGGAAGACGACGG-3′ and reverse primer was 5′-GGCTCACTGT-GTTTGGTAACTTG-3′. The FLAG-TIAR and F-TIA1 peptide constructs were generated by annealing two pairs of complementary oligonucleotides, (5′-GATCCATGCAACCCGATAGCAGAAGGGTCAACTCTTCTGTTGGATTTTCTGTTTTGCACTAAG-3′ and 5′-ATTCTTAGTGCAAAACAGAAAATCAACAGAA-GAGTTGACCCTTC-TGCTATCGGGTTGCATG-3′ for TIAR peptide or 5′-GATCCAGTAGTACCGTTGTCAGCACACAGCGTTCACAATAAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTTATTGTGAACGCTGTGTGCTGACAACGGTACTACTG-3′ for TIA1 peptide) encoding the 17-amino acid stretch of TIAR-a or 11-amino acid stretch of TIA1 flanked by BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites. The oligos include a stop codon to terminate translation. The annealed oligos were ligated in BamHI- andEcoRI-cut pcDNA3/FLAG expression vector. The GFP-TIAR and GFP-TIA1 peptides were made by annealing the above two pairs of complementary oligonucleotides for TIAR peptide or TIA1 peptide and then subcloning them into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen). All constructs described above were sequenced to confirm sequence fidelity. Equimolar amounts of DNA were transiently transfected into cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. Culture medium from cells was concentrated by Centriplus YM-30 centricons (Millipore Corp.), and equal amounts of protein were assayed for MMP13 content by Western blotting. Monoclonal anti-HMMP13 (Chemicon International Inc.) and anti-RMMP13 (Oncogene) antibodies were used for Western blotting at a 1:500 dilution. Whole cell protein extracts were prepared from confluent cells as described previously (22Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F634-F641PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of whole cell extracts were probed with monoclonal anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), polyclonal anti-GFP (Clontech), or polyclonal anti-TIAR antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:1000 dilution. Signal detection was carried out using enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, AmershamBiosciences). The monoclonal anti-HMMP13 and anti-RMMP13 antibodies were specific for human and rat MMP13, respectively. The monoclonal HuR and polyclonal TIAR antibodies reacted with both human and rat proteins. Bands corresponding to the MMP13 were quantitated on the Discovery Series densitometer, and the band intensities were measured using Quantity One software, both from Bio-Rad. The densitometer was calibrated against external standards and was linear to 2 AUFs. We also calibrated it against different amounts of expressed MMP-13 in serum-free cellular supernatants from HCR-transfected HEK293 cells; the response was linear over 10–100 μl of media, and we routinely used 50 μl for Western analysis. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that IL-1β induces interstitial collagenase-3 (MMP13) gene expression and protein secretion in primary cultures of rat mesangial cells (23Daphna-Iken D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F831-F837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the regulation of MMP13 expression in renal mesangial cells, we used primary cultures of mesangial cells from both human and rat. Cultured mesangial cells were stimulated with IL-1β (100units/ml), TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml), or TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 24 or 48 h in serum-free medium. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed for MMP13 message by RT-PCR, and cell culture medium was concentrated and analyzed for MMP13 protein using Western blots. Rat mesangial cells exposed to IL-1β for 24 h showed increased MMP13 mRNA levels, whereas TGF-β1and TNF-α had no effect (Fig. 1 A). In human mesangial cells, IL-1β also increased HMMP13 mRNA levels; however, TGF-β1 was a more effective ligand and TNF-α had no effect (Fig. 1 B). Western blot analysis detected rat MMP13 (RMMP13) protein expression in media from IL-1β-treated rat mesangial cells (Fig. 1 C). However, there was no HMMP13 protein detected in human mesangial cell media after 48 h of stimulation with IL-1β or TGF-β1 (Fig. 1 D). We were also unable to detect HMMP13 protein expression in whole cell lysates, excluding the possibility that HMMP13 protein failed to be secreted (data not shown). Thus, the discordance between the increase in mRNA levels and the absence of HMMP13 protein expression following IL-1β or TGF-β1 treatment suggests that theHMMP13 gene is translationally silenced in human mesangial cells. Furthermore, the differential regulation of MMP13 in human and rat mesangial cells suggests a species-dependent mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation. To determine whether the 3′-UTR was responsible for the differential post-transcriptional regulation of HMMP13 expression, we engineered a series of expression plasmids, shown in Fig. 2. HMMP13-HCR contains cDNA corresponding to the coding region of HMMP13, whereas HMMP13-HFL contains the full-length cDNA (coding region plus the 3′-UTR). HMMP13-HCRU is the combination of the HMMP13 coding region and the 3′-UTR of RMMP13. HEK293, COS-7, and Rat2 cells were transiently transfected with equimolar amounts of these constructs. Human MMP13 protein expression was reduced by 70–80% in HEK293 cells transfected with HMMP13-HFL or -HCRU when compared with cells transfected with HMMP13-HCR (Fig. 3, A andB). Similar results were also found in transiently transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). In contrast, constructs expressed in Rat2 cells resulted in equivalent amounts of MMP13 protein expression regardless of the 3′-UTR present in the message (Fig. 3 E). Interestingly, although only the latent form of HMMP13 was detected in transfected HEK293 and COS-7 cells, both latent and active forms were expressed in transfected Rat2 cells. These data suggest that the suppression of HMMP13 expression requires the 3′-UTR of MMP13, either human or rat, and occurs in human and primate cell lines but not in Rat2 cells.Figure 3The 3′-UTR of MMP13 decreased HMMP13 protein expression in HEK293 and COS-7 cells but not in Rat2 cells. Cells were transiently transfected with either empty vector (Control), or HMMP13-HCR (HCR), HMMP13-HFL (HFL), or HMMP13-HCRU (HCRU). HMMP13 protein levels in transfected HEK293 (A, B), COS-7 (C, D), and Rat2 (E) cells were detected by Western blot and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Values with error bars are means ± S.E. for three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Post-transcriptional regulation of certain genes has been shown to be dependent on AREs present in the 3′-UTR (24Macdonald P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 326-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Several proteins, including AUF1/hnRNPD, HuR, TIA1, and TIAR, are reported to bind AREs. Binding of these proteins to transcripts bearing AREs can have either a positive or negative effect on gene expression (25Chen Cy Gherzi R.F. Ong S.E Chan E.F. Raijmakers R.F. Pruijn G.J Stoecklin G.F. Moroni C.F. Mann M.F. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). To determine whether ARE binding proteins were differentially expressed, we performed Western blot analysis on the cell lines of interest, using anti-HuR and anti-TIAR antibodies. No significant differences in HuR protein expression were observed in human and rat mesangial cells (Fig. 4 A). However, TIAR protein expression was different in human and primate cells compared with rat cells (Fig. 4 B). Human and primate cells expressed two isoforms of TIAR, whereas rat cells expressed only one. TIAR is a member of the RNA recognition motif (RRM) family of RNA binding proteins that has been shown to act as a translational silencer (26Kawakami A. Tian Q. Duan X. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Anderson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8681-8685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This protein possesses three RRM domains that confer high affinity binding to AREs. The TIAR gene encodes two isoforms, TIAR-a and TIAR-b, that arise from alternative splicing of a common precursor transcript (27Le Guiner C. Lejeune F. Galiana D. Kister L. Breathnach R. Stevenin J. Gatto-Konczak F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40638-40646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TIAR-a differs from TIAR-b in that it contains an additional 51 nucleotides in the middle of RRM1 resulting in a 17-amino acid insertion (Fig. 4 D), which has been suggested to play a role in RNA binding specificity (28Dember L.M. Kim N.D. Liu K.Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2783-2788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Interestingly, translational silencing occurred only in the human or primate cell lines, the same cell lines that expressed TIAR-a. The possibility arises, therefore, that species-dependent translational silencing of the HMMP13 gene is because of the differential expression of TIAR-a in human and rat cell cultures. We reasoned that if the 17-amino acid insert of TIAR-a serves as a binding site required for the translational repression of HMMP13, then expression of the peptide QPDSRRVNSSVGFSVLQ encoded by this 51-nucleotide insert may competitively inhibit this binding event and reverse mRNA silencing observed in human and primate cell lines. To test this possibility, we subcloned the 51-nucleotide cDNA into FLAG-tagged pcDNA3 vector to generate the FLAG peptide. HEK293 cells transfected with HMMP13-HCR, HMMP13-HFL, or HMMP13-HCRU were co-transfected with pcDNA3/FLAG (as control) and FLAG peptide. Quantitative PCR demonstrated equivalent levels of HMMP13 mRNA for all experimental conditions, confirming that co-transfection of the plasmid encoding the 17-amino acid peptide had no effect on the steady state level of the message (data not shown). The inclusion of the 3′-UTR of MMP13 resulted in a 60–70% decrease in protein expression, and co-expression of the peptide blocked the reduction of HMMP13 protein expression because of the 3′-UTR, suggesting an interference of translational silencing conferred by TIAR-a (Fig. 5 A). TIA1 is another RNA-binding protein reported to be a translational silencer similar to TIAR and has three RRMs that can bind to mRNAs (29Piecyk M. Wax S. Beck A.R.P. Kedersha N. Gupta M. Maritim B. Chen S. Gueydan C. Kruys V. Streuli M. Anderson P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4154-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). TIA1 can be expressed as two alternatively spliced forms, the difference due to an insert of a small (11-amino acid) peptide. In contrast to the TIAR peptide insert that is located in the middle of the first RRM, the TIA1 peptide insert (SSTVVSTQRSQ) is located between RRM1 and RRM2 (30Beck A.R. Medley Q.G. O'Brien S. Anderson P. Streuli M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3829-3835Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We tested whether this peptide could also reverse the translational silencing of HMMP13. Co-transfection of the FLAG-TIA1 peptide had no effect on HMMP13 protein expression because of the 3′-UTR (rat) and the minimal but not significant effect with human 3′-UTR of MMP13 (Fig. 5 B). In all of these experiments there was no difference between MMP13 expression when co-transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3/FLAG, or pcDNA3/GFP vectors. The data were normalized to the HCR data because of the variability in intensity of Western blots between experiments. Within experiments all exposures were carried out on the same blot and film. This result suggests that interference of translational silencing of HMMP13 is specific for the TIAR peptide. To confirm that the FLAG peptides were expressed, we performed Western blot analysis for the FLAG protein. Unfortunately, we were unable to detect FLAG peptide expression by routine Western blotting. We believe this was because of technical problems generated by the small molecular mass (less than 3 kDa) of the FLAG peptides. To clearly document the expression of epitope-tagged peptide, we therefore engineered a GFP fusion protein (GFP peptide) whose expression was easily demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 6 B). We repeated the transient transfection experiments using the GFP peptides and confirmed that, although the co-transfection of the GFP-TIAR peptide reversed the translational block of HMMP13 protein expression because of the 3′-UTR, the GFP-TIA1 peptide did not (Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, the GFP peptides were in fact expressed at equivalent levels (Fig. 6 B). Rat2 cells express only the TIAR-b isoform, and the 3′-UTR-dependent suppression of HMMP13 expression did not occur in these cells (Fig. 4 C). To determine whether TIAR-a could cause translational silencing of HMMP13 in transfected Rat2 cells, we co-expressed human TIAR-a or TIAR-b (as control) in HCR-, HFL-, or HCRU-transfected Rat2 cells and measured HMMP13 protein levels. FLAG-tagged TIAR-a and TIAR-b were expressed at similar levels in Rat2 cells (Fig. 7 B). Co-expression of TIAR-a resulted in a significant decrease in HMMP13 protein expression when the 3′-UTR of HMMP13 was present, whereas TIAR-b had no significant effect (Fig. 7 A). However, TIAR-b appeared to partially inhibit HMMP13 protein expression in Rat2 cells co-transfected with the HCRU construct (about 25%). The results of this experiment suggest that TIAR-a plays the major role in the 3′-UTR-dependent translational silencing in HMMP13 expression. Thus we have shown, for the first time, species-dependent MMP13 gene silencing in human and primate cell cultures. This post-transcriptional regulation requires the participation of the 3′-UTR of the transcripts and is affected by the expression of a peptide corresponding to the alternatively spliced form of TIAR, namely TIAR-a. These results are consistent with the notion that TIAR-a binds to the 3′-UTR of HMMP13 and inhibits translation. Expression of the peptide competes for the RNA binding site or disrupts protein-protein interactions of TIAR-a. These experiments underscore the concept that alternatively spliced transcripts can regulate the diversity of gene expression. It may also provide a mechanism by which tumors derepress MMP13 expression that may affect their metastasis potential."

Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) are directly phosphorylated by type I receptors, and form complexes with common-partner Smad (Co-Smad). The R-Smad·Co-Smad complexes translocate into the nucleus, where they regulate transcription of target genes through interacting with various transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors. Of the eight different mammalian Smad proteins, Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8 are R-Smads activated by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and anti-Müllerian hormone, whereas Smad2 and Smad3 are R-Smads activated by TGF-βs, activins, and nodal. Smad4 is the only Co-Smad in mammals.Transcription of target genes by TGF-β is up-regulated by binding of Smads to transcriptional co-activators, including p300 and CBP, which induce acetylation of histones (2Feng X.-H.

Among the various regions of Smads, the MH2 domains play important roles in binding to type I receptors, formation of Smad oligomers, and interaction with DNA-binding proteins (13Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, R-Smads and Co-Smads may form heterotrimers or heterodimers through their MH2 domains, although their exact oligomeric structures have not been fully determined (14Chacko B.M.

Smads interact with various transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors through the MH2 domains. Among them, Mixer and FoxH3 (originally termed FAST1) have been shown to bind to α-helix 2 (H2) of the MH2 domains of Smad2/3 (17Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S.

However, sites of binding to other proteins in Smads have not been determined in detail. Interestingly, SnoN was shown to be degraded by a HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2, which binds to the linker region of Smad2 (20Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). SnoN does not directly bind to Smurf2, but it may be located in the vicinity of Smurf2 when it binds to Smad2. It is thus important to determine through which regions c-Ski/SnoN bind to Smad2 and Smad3.Among mammalian Smad proteins, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 interact with c-Ski, but Smad1 or Smad5 does so only weakly (6Akiyoshi S.

In the present study, we have shown that the SE and QPSMT parts in the MH2 domain of Smad3 interact with c-Ski and SnoN. SE and QPSMT are located on the N-terminal upper side of the toroidal structure of the MH2 oligomer, toward which the MH1 domain and the linker region face. Since Smurf2 binds to the linker region of Smad2, it may be located in the vicinity of SnoN. Amino acid sequences similar to SE and QPSMT are found in Smad2, but not in Smad1 or Smad4. Thus, these sequences may be responsible for specific interaction of Smad2/3 with c-Ski and SnoN. Cytokines of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)1 superfamily bind to two different serine/threonine kinase receptors, type I and type II, and transmit intracellular signals through Smad proteins (1Itoh S.

Virol. 1986; 57: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although c-Ski regulates transcriptional activities of some other proteins (11Nomura T. Khan M.M. Kaul S.C. Dong H.D. Wadhwa R.

R-Smads and Co-Smads are composed of the N-terminal MH1 domains, linker regions, and the C-terminal MH2 domains. Among the various regions of Smads, the MH2 domains play important roles in binding to type I receptors, formation of Smad oligomers, and interaction with DNA-binding proteins (13Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.-H. Adv. Immunol. 2000; 75: 115-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon ligand stimulation, R-Smads and Co-Smads may form heterotrimers or heterodimers through their MH2 domains, although their exact oligomeric structures have not been fully determined (14Chacko B.M.

Smads interact with various transcription factors and transcriptional co-activators/co-repressors through the MH2 domains. Among them, Mixer and FoxH3 (originally termed FAST1) have been shown to bind to α-helix 2 (H2) of the MH2 domains of Smad2/3 (17Germain S. Howell M. Esslemont G.M. Hill C.S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 435-451PubMed Google Scholar, 18Randall R.A. Germain S. Inman G.J. Bates P.A. Hill C.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.G.

However, sites of binding to other proteins in Smads have not been determined in detail. Interestingly, SnoN was shown to be degraded by a HECT type E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2, which binds to the linker region of Smad2 (20Bonni S. Wang H.R. Causing C.G. Kavsak P. Stroschein S.L. Luo K. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). SnoN does not directly bind to Smurf2, but it may be located in the vicinity of Smurf2 when it binds to Smad2. It is thus important to determine through which regions c-Ski/SnoN bind to Smad2 and Smad3. Among mammalian Smad proteins, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 interact with c-Ski, but Smad1 or Smad5 does so only weakly (6Akiyoshi S. Inoue H. Hanai J. Kusanagi K. Nemoto N. Miyazono K. Kawabata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35269-35277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that the SE and QPSMT parts in the MH2 domain of Smad3 interact with c-Ski and SnoN. SE and QPSMT are located on the N-terminal upper side of the toroidal structure of the MH2 oligomer, toward which the MH1 domain and the linker region face. Since Smurf2 binds to the linker region of Smad2, it may be located in the vicinity of SnoN. Amino acid sequences similar to SE and QPSMT are found in Smad2, but not in Smad1 or Smad4. Thus, these sequences may be responsible for specific interaction of Smad2/3 with c-Ski and SnoN. We thank M. Yanagiwatari for technical assistance, C. S. Hill for the Mixer cDNA, T.

The limited cofactor activity observed with the isolated A2 subunit is markedly enhanced by the A1 subunit. A truncated A1 (A1336) was previously shown to possess similar affinity for A2 and retain ∼60% of its A2 stimulatory activity. We now identify a second site in A1 at Lys36 that is cleaved by factor Xa. A1 truncated at both cleavage sites (A137–336) showed little if any affinity for A2 (K d>2 μm), whereas factor VIIIa reconstituted with A2 plus A137–336/A3-C1-C2 dimer demonstrated significant cofactor activity (∼30% that of factor VIIIa reconstituted with native A1) in a factor Xa generation assay. These affinity values were consistent with values obtained by fluorescence energy transfer using acrylodan-labeled A2 and fluorescein-labeled A1. In contrast, factor VIIIa reconstituted with A137–336 showed little activity in a one-stage clotting assay. This resulted in part from a 5-fold increase inK m for factor X when A1 was cleaved at Arg336. These findings suggest that both A1 termini are necessary for functional interaction of A1 with A2. Furthermore, the C terminus of A1 contributes to the K m for factor X binding to factor Xase, and this parameter is critical for activity assessed in plasma-based assays.

Factor VIII functions as a cofactor for the serine protease, factor IXa, in the anionic phospholipid surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa. Factor VIII is synthesized as a multi-domain, single chain molecule (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) (1Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N.

Factor VIII is processed to a series of divalent metal ion-linked heterodimers by cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a heavy chain consisting of the A1-A2-B domains and a light chain consisting of the A3-C1-C2 domains. This procofactor is activated by cleavage at Arg372, Arg740, and Arg1689 by thrombin and factor Xa, converting the dimer into the factor VIIIa trimer composed of the A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits (4Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 5Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting factor VIIIa heterotrimer retains the metal ion-dependent linkage between the A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits, whereas A2 is associated with a weak affinity by electrostatic interactions (5Fay P.J.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa is unstable, and loss of activity is due to the dissociation of the A2 subunit from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (5Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fay P.J.

Under physiological conditions, the K d for this interaction is ∼260 nm (8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, at slightly acidic pH and low ionic strength, this interaction is facilitated by an ∼10-fold increase in the affinity (K d = ∼30 nm) (8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of factor VIIIa in the intrinsic factor Xase is to bind factor IXa, which increases the k cat for factor Xa formation by several orders of magnitude compared with factor IXa alone (10van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactive sites for factor IXa are localized to A2 and A3 domains (11Fay P.J.

Recent studies have shown that modulation of factor IXa by the isolated A2 subunit enhances the k catfor factor Xa activation by ∼100-fold (14Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and that the isolated A1 subunit synergizes this effect (>15-fold) to alter the interaction of A2 subunit with the protease (15Fay P.J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Early evidence suggested that the C-terminal acidic region of A1 subunit (residues 337–372) represented an A2-interactive site and participated in A2 retention following thrombin activation (17Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This region is also implicated in the binding of factor X (18Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although the significance of this cofactor-substrate interaction is not well understood. The A1 subunit is cleaved at Arg336 by activated protein C (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), factor IXa (20O'Brien D.P. Johnson D. Byfield P. Tuddenham E.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Lamphear B.J. Fay P.J. Blood. 1992; 80: 3120-3126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and factor Xa (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Proteolysis at this site correlates with inactivation of factor VIIIa. Thus, this cleavage is thought to represent a mechanism for the dampening of factor Xase activity. A recent study demonstrated that a truncated subunit lacking the C terminus of A1 (A1336) possessed similar affinity for A2 subunit and retained ∼60% of the A2 stimulatory activity compared with native A1 (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, that study also suggested that the C-terminal region of A1 appeared critical for proper orientation of A2 subunit in factor VIIIa relative to factor IXa (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the intersubunit interactions of factor VIIIa employing a purified A1 subunit form possessing a newly identified cleavage site and designated as A137–336, following cleavage at both termini (Lys36 and Arg336) by factor Xa. These results demonstrate a role for the N terminus of the A1 subunit in preserving a conformation of the subunit necessary for functional interaction with the A2 subunit. Furthermore, these results define a role for the A1 C-terminal region in contributing to theK m for substrate factor X binding to factor Xase. Thus, specific mechanisms for the loss of factor VIIIa function and down-regulation of factor Xase can now be attributed to individual cleavages of the A1 subunit by factor Xa. Purified recombinant factor VIII preparations were generous gifts from Bayer Corp. (Berkeley, CA) and the Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). The monoclonal antibody 58.12 recognizing the N-terminal end of A1 (22O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J.

Houghten R.A. de Graaf Mahoney S. Zimmerman T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) was a gift from Drs. Carol Fulcher and Zaverio Ruggeri. Phospholipid vesicles containing 20% PS,1 40% PC, and 40% PE (Sigma) were prepared usingN-octylglucoside (24Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). TAP was a gift from Dr. S. Krishnaswamy. The reagents human α-thrombin, factor IXa, factor X, and factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) and the chromogenic Xa substrate S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-arginyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide-dihydrochloride; DiaPharm Group, Westchester, OH) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Acrylodan and fluorescein-5-maleimide were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Each factor VIII subunit was isolated from recombinant factor VIII. Factor VIII (1.5 μm) was treated overnight at 4 °C in buffer containing 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.25 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Tween 20, and the light chain and heavy chain were isolated following chromatography on SP-Sepharose and Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (25Fay P.J. Mastri M. Koszelak M.E. Wakabayashi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12434-12439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The purified heavy chain was cleaved by thrombin, and the A2 and A1 subunits were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Hi-Trap Heparin column and a Mono-Q column as reported previously (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The A3-C1-C2 subunit was prepared as previously described (18Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was isolated from thrombin-treated factor VIIIa using a Mono-S column chromatography, and residual A2 subunit was removed using an anti-A2 subunit monoclonal antibody coupled to Affi-Gel 10. The A3-C1-C2 subunit was further purified following dissociation of dimer by EDTA and chromatography on Mono-Q (8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE of the isolated subunits showed >95% purity. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa was added to the purified A1 (11 μm) in a 1:10 (mol/mol) ratio in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 and reacted overnight at 22 °C. The reaction was quenched using TAP at an ∼5-fold molar excess relative to factor Xa. The cleaved A1 subunit was fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Pharmacia Hi-Trap chelating column (1.0 ml), to which 100 μl of 0.1m CuCl2 was added beforehand (27Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The truncated A1 subunit was eluted at 0.2–0.3 m glycine using a linear glycine gradient (0–1.0 m) in 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. The purity of truncated A1 subunit (A137–336) was >95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. A chromogenic assay revealed <0.1% residual factor Xa activity or TAP present in the purified A137–336. A truncated A1336 subunit was prepared as described earlier (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To obtain fluorescein-labeled A1 (Fl-A1) or A137–336, purified A1 (20 μm) or A137–336 (6.5 μm) subunits in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 were reacted with a 50-fold molar excess of fluorescein 5-maleimide in the dark at 22 °C for 4 h. The unbound fluorescein 5-maleimide was removed by dialyzing the reaction mixture at 4 °C overnight in the above buffer. Acrylodan-labeled A2 (Ac-A2) was obtained from reacting factor VIII (1.5 μm) in the above buffer with a 10-fold molar excess of acrylodan. Labeling conditions and removal of unbound acrylodan were as described above. Isolated Ac-A2 subunit was purified from labeled, EDTA-treated factor VIII following thrombin cleavage using the combination of SP-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and Hi-Trap heparin chromatography steps as described above. Approximately 0.9–1.1 mol of fluorescein 5-maleimide was incorporated/mol of A1 or A137–336 subunit. The incorporation of acrylodan into A2 subunit was 1.0–1.2 mol/subunit. The A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was reconstituted with 500 nm A3-C1-C2 and variable levels of A1 form overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20. The dimer solution was diluted 10-fold, and factor VIIIa was formed by the addition of 20 nm A2 subunit in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 20. The reconstitution reactions were run at 22 °C, and the resulting factor VIIIa activity was determined after 15 min by a one-stage clotting assay using factor VIII-deficient plasma (28Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (29Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For assays examining the stimulation of isolated A2 subunit by A1 subunit forms, 400 nm A2 subunit was first reacted with variable levels of A1 form for 15 min followed by incubation with 5 nm factor IXa and 10 μm PS-PC-PE vesicle in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.01% Tween 20 for 10 min. For assays examining factor VIIIa reconstitution from A2 subunit plus A1/A3-C1-C2 dimers comprised of different forms of A1, the dimers and 20 nm A2 subunit were reconstituted and incubated with 20 nm factor IXa and 10 μm PS-PC-PE vesicle for 30 s in the above buffer. The reactions for either assay were initiated with the addition of 500 nm factor X. The aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (final concentration, 50 mm) to stop the reaction. The rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (final concentration, 0.46 mm). The reactions were read at 405 nm using aV max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All of the reactions were run at 22 °C. Fl-A1/A3-C1-C2 or Fl-A137–336/A3-C1-C2 dimer was formed by reacting 2 μm A3-C1-C2 and 2 μm Fl-A1 or Fl-A137–336 as described above. Ac-A2 (100 or 200 nm) was reconstituted with varying amounts of the dimer or isolated Fl-A1 subunit forms for 30 min at 22 °C in 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 0.01% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence measurements were conducted using an Amico-Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY). The reconstitution reactions were excited at 395 nm, and emission spectra were monitored at 420–550 nm. Emission scans were run at 3 nm/s in triplicate, and the average values of the spectra were recorded. All of the spectra were corrected for background fluorescence resulting from the reaction buffer and the fluorescein-labeled dimer or Fl-A1 form. The percentage of donor quenching was calculated from integrated fluorescence intensities at λ = 460–480 nm. SDS-PAGE was performed on a 8% gel using the procedure of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was carried out using a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus at 150 V for 1 h. The bands were visualized following staining with GelCode Blue Stain Regent (Pierce). Alternatively, the protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transblot apparatus at 50 V for 2 h in buffer containing 10 mmCAPS, pH 11, and 10% (v/v) methanol. The protein was probed using the 58.12 and C5 monoclonal antibodies followed by goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibody. The signal was detected using the ECF system (Amersham Biosciences), and the blots were scanned at 570 nm using Storm 860 (Molecular Devices). N-terminal sequence analysis of the factor Xa-cleaved A1 subunit was performed using an Applied BioSystems Procise Sequenator by the Protein Sequencing Facility at Cornell University. The subunit was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride and stained with Ponceau S, and the band was excised. The sample was subjected to 10 cycles of sequencing. Factor Xa cleaves the A1 subunit (residues 1–372) of human factor VIIIa at Arg336 yielding a truncated subunit lacking the C-terminal domain rich in acidic amino acids (19Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Because this cleavage inactivates cofactor activity, an examination of the A1-associated activities following interaction of the isolated subunit with factor Xa was undertaken. We observed that an extended interaction of the subunit with protease (10:1 molar ratio) converted A1 into a subunit of ∼40 kDa, which was significantly smaller than the A1 subunit truncated at Arg336 (∼45 kDa). Pretreatment of factor Xa with a molar excess of TAP resulted in no generation of either fragment, indicating that both cleavages were catalyzed by factor Xa (results not shown). Purification of this fragment was problematic because it did not bind to either Mono S or Mono Q columns under low salt conditions. However, it was adsorbed by a Cu2+-bound Hi-Trap chelating column utilizing the copper binding of His residues (27Porath J. Carlsson J. Olsson I. Belfrage G. Nature. 1975; 258: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar) and was eluted quantitatively and with high purity (>95%) with 0.2–0.3m glycine. Fig. 1 Ashows gel electrophoresis of A1, A1336, and the ∼40-kDa subunit. A chromogenic assay revealed <0.1% residual factor Xa activity or TAP (used to inactivate the factor Xa) present in the purified fraction. This fragment was further characterized by Western blot analysis, which employed anti-A1 domain monoclonal antibodies specific for the N- and C-terminal sequences. Although native A1 and A1336 subunits were reactive with monoclonal antibody 58.12 (an antibody directed to residues 1–12 of the A1 sequence), the 40-kDa A1 was not identified (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Use of the C5 antibody (specific for residues contained with 337–372) showed reactivity with the native A1 subunit only and did not react with either the 40-kDa A1 form or A1336 (Fig. 1 B, right panel). These findings indicated that the 40-kDa A1 subunit was truncated at both termini. To identify the site of cleavage that results in the N-terminal truncation, the ∼40-kDa A1 form was subjected to 10 cycles of automated N-terminal sequence analysis (Table I). Results from this analysis indicated that this A1 form was derived from cleavage at Lys36-Ser37. Thus, cleavage at this site was consistent with no reactivity using the monoclonal antibody specific for the A1 N terminus. This 40-kDa A1 subunit was designated as A137–336. Interestingly, the residue specified at cycle number 5 (Asn41) was not identified. Because this Asn is contained within the N-X-(T/S) N-linked glycosylation site consensus sequence (31Medzihradszky K.F. Besman M.J. Burlingarne A.L. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 3986-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), failure to identify this residue provides direct support for utilization of Asn41for N-linked glycosylation.Table IAmino-terminal sequence analysis of the ∼40-kDa A1 subunitCycle no.12345678910A1 residues 37–46 (K)SFPFNTSVVY40-kDa fragment (pmol)S (7.6)F (6.1)P (4.8)F (4.8)—1-a—, not identified.(ND)1-bND, not detected.T (3.2)S (1.9)V (2.8)V (3.3)Y (2.0)1-a —, not identified.1-b ND, not detected. Open table in a new tab We previously demonstrated that the isolated A2 subunit possesses limited cofactor activity in stimulating factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X (14Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and this activity is markedly enhanced in the presence of A1 subunit (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To gain insights into critical regions of A1 required for this stimulation of A2, the cofactor activity of A2 in the presence of the native form and the two truncated A1 forms were compared using a factor Xa generation assay. Variable levels of A1 forms and 400 nmA2 subunit were combined, and the reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 nm factor IXa and 500 nm factor X as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results for the stimulation of A2 by each A1 form are shown in Fig. 2 and TableII. Negligible levels of activity were obtained in the absence of A2 (data not shown) and were corrected for prior to curve fitting. Similar to the recent observations of Koszelak Rosenblum et al. (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the A1336 subunit stimulated A2 activity to ∼60% the level observed for native A1, whereas similar affinities of the two A1 forms for A2 were observed. In contrast, the V max value obtained for A137–336 subunit in stimulating A2 cofactor activity (∼0.3 min−1) was only slightly greater than the value obtained with A2 subunit alone (∼0.1 min−1; data not shown). Although a functional K d value was difficult to quantitate given the low levels of activity, these data suggest a weak intersubunit interaction for this A1 form with A2 (K d > 2 μm), consistent with a marked reduction in the capacity of A137–336 to bind A2. Taken together, these results indicate that the N-terminal region of A1 is required for high affinity interaction with A2 subunit and subsequent stimulation of A2 activity.Table IIKinetic and binding parameters for interactions of A1 and A2 subunitsA1 formV maxK dfor A2−A3-C1-C2+A3-C1-C2−A3-C1-C2+A3-C1-C2min −1nmA111.3 ± 0.426.9 ± 0.9428 ± 48202 ± 21A13366.8 ± 0.313.0 ± 0.7632 ± 70299 ± 51A137–336∼0.38.0 ± 0.3>2000245 ± 35The parameter values were calculated by nonlinear least squares regression from the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 using the formula shown under “Materials and Methods.” Open table in a new tab The parameter values were calculated by nonlinear least squares regression from the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 using the formula shown under “Materials and Methods.” Although the A137–336 possessed little ability to directly stimulate the A2 subunit, an additional series of experiments was performed to assess the capacity of this A1 form to reconstitute factor VIIIa following association of A3-C1-C2 and A2 subunits. Factor VIIIa was reconstituted in a two-step procedure. In the first step the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer form was prepared by reacting varying amounts of the A1 forms and 500 nm A3-C1-C2 subunit in the presence of Ca2+ overnight at 4 °C. The resultant dimer solutions were diluted 10-fold and reacted with the A2 subunit (20 nm) to generate the factor VIIIa heterotrimers. Reconstituted factor VIIIa activity was determined in a factor Xa generation assay initiated by the addition of factor IXa (20 nm) and factor X (500 nm) as described under “Materials and Methods.” These data are illustrated in Fig. 3 and Table II. TheV max values obtained at saturating levels of factor VIIIa reconstituted from native A1 and A1336 with A3-C1-C2 plus A2 subunits were 26.9 ± 0.9 and 13.0 ± 0.7 min−1, respectively. These relative activity values were similar to results obtained above for the direct stimulation of the A2 subunit. The K d value for the intersubunit interaction with A2 using native A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer was 202 ± 21 nm, a value similar to the earlier reported values obtained under physiological conditions (∼260 nm) (8Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the K d value (299 ± 51 nm) for A2 subunit interaction with the A1336/A3-C1-C2 dimer was similar to that of native A1. Interestingly, although isolated A137–336 had little ability to directly stimulate the A2 subunit, likely in part a consequence of a weak affinity interaction for A2, reconstitution of A137–336/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus A2 subunits yielded a form of factor VIIIa that demonstrated significant cofactor activity. This activity (8.0 ± 0.3 min−1) was ∼30% the value compared with factor VIIIa formed with native A1 and ∼60% of the activity formed with A1336. Furthermore, the A137–336/A3-C1-C2 dimer showed equivalent affinity for the A2 subunit (K d = 245 ± 35 nm) compared with the values obtained for the native dimer and A1336/A3-C1-C2 dimer. This association of the A137–336 subunit with A3-C1-C2 resulted in a >10-fold affinity enhancement compared with that observed for isolated A137–336 subunit. These results indicate that both a physical and functional interaction of the A137–336subunit with A2 requires association of this A1 form with the A3-C1-C2 and suggests that this interaction is mediated by an A3-C1-C2-dependent change in the conformation of the A137–336 subunit. Activity of the reconstituted factor VIIIa composed of either native A1 or A137–336 forms was measured in a one-stage clotting assay as described under “Materials and Methods.” Compared with factor VIIIa reconstituted with native A1 form, little if any activity was observed for that with the A137–336 form (Fig. 4). This result was in contrast to the results obtained in a factor Xa generation assay with factor VIIIa comprised of the A137–336 form, which yielded ∼30% of the activity of factor VIIIa containing native A1. Similarly, we previously reported no activity of factor VIIIa composed of A1336 in a one-stage clotting assay (16Koszelak Rosenblum M.E. Schmidt K. Freas J. Mastri M. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11664-11669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), whereas this form showed ∼60% of native activity in a factor Xa generation assay in the current study. Thus, the failure to observe factor VIIIa activity with trimer reconstituted from the A137–336 form using a one-stage clotting assay was consistent with the earlier result. Overall these results suggest that the lack of the C-terminal region of A1 leads to disparate results in"

However, to date only one member of this family, the protein kinase Aurora B, has been implicated in the regulation of meiotic division inCaenorhabditis elegans. In this species, disruption of Aurora B results in the failure of polar body extrusion. To investigate whether Aurora A is also required in meiosis, we microinjected highly specific α-Aurora A antibodies in Xenopus oocytes. We demonstrated that microinjected oocytes fail to extrude the first polar body and are arrested with condensed chromosomes on a typical metaphase I plate, which has not performed its normal 90° rotation. We additionally found that, although the failure of first polar body extrusion observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes is likely mediated by Eg5, the impairment of the metaphase plate rotation does not involve this kinesin-like protein. Surprisingly, although chromosomes remain condensed at a metaphase I stage in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes, the cytoplasmic cell cycle events progress normally through meiosis until metaphase II arrest.

Thus, a direct interaction of the Aurora B kinase with the inner centromere protein (INCENP) has been reported as required for kinetochore disjunction and chromosome segregation during mitosis (2Nigg E.A.

The Aurora A kinase has also been involved in mitosis, because either RNA-mediated interference or mutational inactivation of the Drosophila Aurora A gene perturbs the formation of the embryonic bipolar mitotic spindle (5Giet R.

InXenopus, the disorganization of a preformed mitotic metaphase plate in egg extracts can also be induced by adding either a specific antibody or a catalytically inactive mutant of the Aurora A kinase (7Giet R.

Cubizolles F., Le Guellec K. Prigent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15005-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), can also induce a collapse of a performed mitotic metaphase (10Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J.

Despite the established role of Aurora kinase family in mitosis, little is known about its participation in the control of meiosis. In this regard, up to this date, only Aurora B has been shown to be involved in meiosis. Maternal depletion of Aurora B inCaenorhabditis elegans results in a failure of polar body extrusion during first meiotic division, because of a cytokinesis defect (12Scumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the involvement of the Aurora kinase family in meiosis, we investigated here whether in addition to Aurora B, Aurora A, which is expressed at low levels at the first meiotic prophase in Xenopus oocytes, is also involved in the control of meiotic division. Ovaries fromXenopus laevis females were surgically removed. Fully grown oocytes were prepared, free from follicle cells, by collagenase treatment and transferred in MMR buffer (100 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.7) in which all experiments were performed. The usual volume microinjected was 50 nl. Progesterone was used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. To prepare homogenates from oocytes, single oocytes were crushed in a buffer containing 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.3, and then briefly centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were then used for Western blots or kinase assays. Scoring experiments for the rate of GVBD1 after various microinjections were conducted on at least 50 oocytes that stem from four different Xenopus females. When parthenogenetically activated oocytes were used, immature oocytes were first incubated overnight in the presence of 2 μg/ml progesterone and subsequently activated by adding ionophoreA23187 (Sigma) into the buffer at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Oocytes were microinjected with either 100 ng of antibodies or together with 500 ng of corresponding recombinant protein when indicated. Aliquots of Xenopus cell-free extracts were prepared as previously described (13Castro A. Peter M. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Vigneron S. Galas S. Lorca T. Labbé J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified antibodies against Xenopuscyclin B2 and the C-terminal peptide sequence of XenopusCdc2 have been described elsewhere (14Lorca T. Castro A. Martinez A.M. Vigneron S. Morin N.

The polyclonal antibodies against Xenopus Aurora A were raised in Rabbits against recombinant full-length Aurora A-His6 and immunopurified using the recombinant Aurora A protein cross-linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as an affinity matrix. Rabbit Ig used as controls were obtained from Sigma. The secondary anti-rabbit Ig-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was diluted according to the supplier's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences), and Western blot was monitored using ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Monoclonal anti-Xenopus Aurora A antibodies as well as anti-Eg5 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. Prigent (8Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I., Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Rennes, France, and Dr. Blangy, Montpellier, France, respectively. Recombinant full-length Aurora A-His6 protein was affinity-purified and then dialyzed according to the supplier's recommendations (Qiagen). H1 activities on Cdc2 immunoprecipitates were assayed as described (16Lorca T. Cruzalegui F.H. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.C. Mery J. Means A. Dorée M. Nature. 1993; 366: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Oocytes were fixed for 1 h in a HEPES buffer (100 m KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8) containing 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated overnight at room temperature in the HEPES buffer containing 20 μg/liter Hoechst. Stained oocytes were then transferred in HEPES buffer free of Hoechst stain and viewed from the animal pole with a UV epifluorescence immersion objective (63X/0.90W U-V-I; Leica). To asses the putative role of Aurora A in meiosis, we produced antibodies against recombinant Xenopus Aurora A. These antibodies specifically recognize and immunoprecipitate Xenopus Aurora A and do not cross-react with the other member of the Aurora A family, the Aurora B protein (Fig. 1, A andB, respectively; see also Ref. 4Adams R.R. Wheatleya S.P. Gouldsworthy A.M. Kandels-Lewis S.E. Carmena M. Smythe C. Gerloff D.L. Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1075-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar and supplementary data in Ref. 18Castro A. Arlot-Bonnemains Y. Vigneron S. Labbé J.C. Prigent C. Lorca T. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, they do not inhibit Aurora A myelin basic protein kinase activity in vitro (data not shown). Indeed, previous reports have already shown mitotic spindle disorganization induced by treatment of Xenopus egg extracts with anti-Aurora A monoclonal antibodies that neither recognize the catalytic domain of the kinase nor inhibit its kinase activity (7Giet R. Prigent C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggests that such antibodies may exert their effect by perturbing the functional targeting of the kinase and/or the accessibility of its substrate. We microinjected prophase-arrested Xenopus oocytes with either α-Aurora A antibodies (final concentration 13 ng/μl) or, as a control, the same amount of rabbit Ig. Then progesterone was added into the media to induce meiotic maturation. Both microinjected and control oocytes underwent germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) with similar kinetics (Fig. 2 A). To determine the cell cycle status of the corresponding oocytes, we monitored the H1-kinase activity of Cdc2 at GVBD as a main landmark of the G2-M transition. No differences between control and treated oocytes were detected in the level of H1-kinase activity at the time of GVBD (Fig. 2 B). We then assessed the cytological status of microinjected α-Aurora A or control oocytes by Hoechst dye staining and direct observation under a UV epifluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig. 3, normal meiotic maturation inXenopus oocytes is characterized by the formation of a first metaphase plate (20–60 min after GVBD), which is perpendicular to the surface of the oocyte, followed by rotation of the metaphase plate by 90° (60–80 min after GVBD). Finally, homologous chromosomes undergo anaphase (90–120 min after GVBD) leading to the extrusion of the first polar body and meiotic metaphase II arrest (180 min after GVBD). As shown in Fig. 2 C (top left), control oocytes fixed 3 h after GVBD had reached second meiotic metaphase and arrested at this step. In contrast, oocytes microinjected with α-Aurora A antibodies (Fig. 2 C, top right) were systematically (see Table I) arrested, with condensed chromosomes aligned on a metaphase plate oriented perpendicular to the oocyte surface. This arrested phenotype is in fact similar to the normal early metaphase plate before rotation of the first meiotic spindle in control oocytes at 1 h after GVBD (Fig. 2 C, middle left, and Fig. 3; see Ref. 19Gard D.L. Dev. Biol. 1992; 151: 516-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, no changes in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes were observed when they were fixed 10 h after GVBD (Fig. 2 C, middle right), suggesting that chromosomes moved to form the first metaphase plate and did not proceed further in the first meiotic cell cycle. Arrest at the first meitotic metaphase before spindle rotation was a specific consequence of blocking some essential function of Aurora A protein, because microinjection of control antibodies had no such effect (Fig. 2 C, bottom right). Moreover, no arrest at first meiotic metaphase was observed when oocytes were co-injected with an excess of recombinant Aurora A protein together with the native antibodies (Fig. 2 C, bottom left). We know that under these conditions the recombinant Aurora A protein inhibits antigen-antibody binding because the Western blot signal corresponding to Aurora A kinase in interphase and metaphase II-arrested egg extracts dramatically decreased when these preabsorbed antibodies were used (Fig. 2 D). The rotation of condensed chromosomes on the metaphase plate was never observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes arrested at the first meiotic cell cycle. However, suppression of chromosomes segregation does not appear to be associated necessarily with a failure of the metaphase plate rotation, because a very small proportion (see Table I) of injected oocytes escaped metaphase I arrest and progressed to first meiotic anaphase even though the metaphase plate failed to rotate (Fig. 4,A and B). Because these experiments were conducted on at least four different sets of oocytes, these latter results probably reflect a slight natural heterogeneity of the microinjected oocytes regarding the potential effect of microinjection. Additionally, this subset of oocytes that were less responsive to microinjection allow us to postulate that metaphase I plate rotation is not required for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition to take place.Table Iα-Aurora A microinjection arrests Xenopus oocytes at meiosis IPhenotypeα-Auroraα-Aurora + antigenRabbit Igα-Eg5Arrest at metaphase of meiosis I493043Arrest at anaphase of meiosis I2000Arrest at metaphase of meiosis II328390Total scored oocytes54313943Microinjected oocytes with the indicated antibodies were observed upon epifluoresence microscope as described under “Materials and Methods.” For each set of microinjection experiments, the observations were conducted on oocytes that stemmed from four differentXenopus females.

To investigate whether the role of Aurora A in meiosis is mediated by its substrate, Eg5, we tested for whether this kinesin-like protein is also required to develop complete meiotic division by microinjecting oocytes with highly specific α-Eg5 antibodies (see Fig. 3 B) or with rabbit Ig in controls. Prophase oocytes microinjected with both rabbit Ig or α-Eg5 antibodies reached GVBD with the same kinetics when treated with progesterone (data not shown). However, only α-Eg5-microinjected oocytes failed to emit the first polar body (Table I and Fig. 4 C) by the time controls had reached the second meiotic metaphase arrest (Fig. 4 D), indicating that, like Aurora A, Eg5 is also required for the oocyte to resume meiosis. Moreover, although the first meiotic metaphase plate rotation was not impaired (Fig. 4 C), the subsequent organization of condensed chromosomes was greatly perturbed, as observed in fixed oocytes 10 h after GVBD (Fig. 4, E and F). This disorganization of the condensed chromosomes resembles the previously described phenotype on the mitotic metaphase plate observed on cultured cells after monastrol treatment (10Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Screiber S.L. Michison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 11Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Aurora A, likely through its substrate Eg5, controls metaphase I exit; however, they also indicate that the failure of metaphase I plate rotation in these oocytes is mediated mainly by Aurora A and does not involve the kinesin-like Eg5. During meiosis of Xenopusoocytes, a window of cyclin degradation occurs in the course of the metaphase I to metaphase II transition (20Ferrel E.F. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 21Oshumi K. Sawada W. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3005-3013PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thibier C., De Smedt V. Poulhe R. Huchon D. Jessus C. Ozon R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This window of degradation is, however, naturally hidden by a dynamic cyclin neosynthesis. Following this window, a progressive cyclin stabilization step occurs, which culminates with a final high and permanent level of Cdc2 activity. This cyclin stabilization results directly from an accumulation of cytostatic factor activity (CSF) during meiosis and allows the installation of a permanent Cdc2 kinase activity (21Oshumi K. Sawada W. Kishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3005-3013PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thibier C., De Smedt V. Poulhe R. Huchon D. Jessus C. Ozon R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, because they contain CSF activity, vertebrate oocytes fail to degrade cyclin B and are arrested at the second meiotic metaphase until fertilization. It is well known that protein synthesis is not required after GVBD for completion of the first meiotic cell cycle in Xenopus oocytes. Thus, to facilitate detection of cyclin degradation, we used cycloheximide (CHX) to suppress protein synthesis during progesterone-induced meiotic maturation after GVBD. We then assessed whether the first metaphase I arrest observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes could be the result of a cyclin stabilization, leading to a possible cell cycle arrest, by monitoring both cyclin B2 degradation and Cdc2 activity during meiosis. Progesterone-treated oocytes, previously microinjected or not with α-Aurora A antibodies at the prophase stage, were transferred at the indicated times after GVBD for 1 h in a buffer containing CHX. Then they were homogenized to allow immunoblotting detection of cyclin B2 as well as H1-kinase assay on Cdc2 immunoprecipitates. As shown (Fig. 5 A), cyclin B2 disappeared in control and α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes at 30–60 min after GVBD. As a result of a nonreplacement of degraded cyclin due to the CHX, Cdc2 kinase activity remained low. Moreover, a high Cdc2 activity and no cyclin B2 degradation were detected in both α-Aurora A- and rabbit Ig-microinjected oocytes when CHX was added 100 min or more after GVBD, by the time that oocytes were already arrested at metaphase II. The normal degradation of cyclin B2 observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes indicates that the metaphase I arrest in those oocytes is not the result of a general block of the meiotic cell cycle. Moreover, despite the fact that the time course establishment of the CSF activity, as revealed by cyclin B2 accumulation and an increase in Cdc2 activity (Fig. 5 A), remained unaffected in α-Aurora A-treated oocytes, the cytological condensed status of meiosis I-arrested chromosomes did not evolve during this period (Fig. 2 C, middle right). When Xenopus metaphase II-arrested oocytes are electrically stimulated or treated with ionophore A23187, two procedures that mimic fertilization, they resume anaphase II concomitantly with cyclin degradation (13Castro A. Peter M. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Vigneron S. Galas S. Lorca T. Labbé J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We then asked whether cyclin B2 degradation could be impaired in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes upon ionophore treatment. To test this possibility, prophase Xenopusoocytes were microinjected with either α-Aurora A or the same amount of rabbit Ig. Then progesterone was added to resume meiotic maturation, and by the time that control oocytes arrested at metaphase II, oocytes were activated with the ionophore. Time course degradation of the endogenous cyclin B2 was then monitored by immunoblot. As shown in Fig. 5 B, both treated and control oocytes normally degraded cyclin B2. Our results indicate that, in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes, the failure to resume the first meiotic anaphase does not impair subsequent cyclin degradation upon parthenogenetic activation. A growing number of reports indicate a requirement for Aurora A and B in mitosis. Aurora A kinase has been implicated in the maintenance of mitotic metaphase plate as well as in cytokinesis (1Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Aurora kinase family seems to be also involved in meiotic division because maternal Aurora B depletion in C. elegans results in the failure of polar body extrusion during first meiosis (12Scumacher J.M. Golden A. Donovan P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We investigated here whether Aurora A, which is expressed at low levels at first meiotic prophase in Xenopusoocytes (8Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I., Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Dorée M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gönczy P. Hyman A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24Palmer R.E. Sullivan D.S. Huffaker T. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), plays a role in the meiotic cell cycle. We used microinjection of highly specific α-Aurora A antibodies to target Aurora A kinase in vivo. We show here that, upon microinjection, the ability of the recipient oocytes to resume meiotic maturation until GVBD and to activate the Cdc2 kinase is not impaired. However, we were surprised to find that the same recipient oocytes failed to emit the first polar body and were arrested at meiosis I with condensed chromosomes. Moreover the condensed chromosomes remain aligned on a metaphase plate oriented perpendicular to the oocyte surface. Although spindle rotation was never observed in meiosis I-arrested oocytes, we showed, in some limited cases, however, a small proportion of α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes that escaped metaphase I arrest and progressed to first meiotic anaphase. This subset of particularly less responsive oocytes probably indicates that metaphase I to anaphase I transition in Xenopus oocytes does not need a previous 90° rotation of the metaphase plate. On the basis of these results, we concluded that Aurora A kinase is involved in separation of homologous chromosomes and spindle rotation during meiosis. Because Aurora A is a protein kinase it makes sense to hypothesize that this protein exerts its role by phosphorylating one or several key substrates controlling meiosis resumption. Microinjection of α-Aurora A antibodies into Xenopus oocytes may inhibit phosphorylation of the Aurora A targets. However, we (data not shown) and others (7Giet R. Prigent C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that these antibodies have no effect on Aurora A kinase activity, indicating that their blocking activity is probably mediated by perturbation of functional targeting and/or substrate accessibility. The kinesin-like Eg5 is a well reported substrate of Aurora A inXenopus (9Giet R. Uzbekov R. Cubizolles F., Le Guellec K. Prigent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15005-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Disruption of this protein in different cell lines leads to a disorganization of the mitotic metaphase plate (10Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Screiber S.L. Michison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar,11Kapoor T.M. Mayer T.U. Coughlin M.L. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 975-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) similar to that observed when Aurora A is blocked (9Giet R. Uzbekov R. Cubizolles F., Le Guellec K. Prigent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15005-15013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As described previously herein for α-Aurora A antibodies, α-Eg5-microinjected oocytes fail to emit the first polar body and are arrested with condensed chromosomes organized on a rotated metaphase plate. Thus, because α-Eg5-microinjected oocytes always succeed in the 90° metaphase I plate rotation, we conclude that Aurora A may be involved in two different mechanisms, the first one regulating metaphase I exit, which is likely mediated by Eg5, and the second one, independent of Eg5, which may control metaphase I plate rotation. In this regard, there is no data concerning the regulation of spindle rotation by this kinesin-like protein either in Xenopus oocytes or other cell types. Unlike Eg5, the role of the dynein-dynactin complex in spindle rotation during embryogenesis and cell division has been reported largely in several species, for example in C. elegans (23Gönczy P. Hyman A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24Palmer R.E. Sullivan D.S. Huffaker T. Koshland D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 25Muhua L. Karpova T.S. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 669-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or in mammalian cells (26O'Connell C.B. Wang Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1765-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The current model proposes that astral microtubules interact with cortical actin and dynactin through one dynactin subunit, the actin-capping protein. Then, tethered by dynactin, dynein interacts with the plus-end of microtubules and pulls toward the anterior cortex by minus-end-directed motility causing spindle rotation (23Gönczy P. Hyman A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, dynactin is localized to the cortical microtubules capture site, and both dynactin and dynein are required for spindle rotation (27Skop A.R. White J.G. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1110-1116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several evidences indicate that the dynein-dynactin-dependent mechanism of spindle orientation is regulated by phosphorylation of both complexes. Thus, phosphorylation of p150(Glued), a subunit of the dynactin complex, mediates dynamic binding to microtubules (28Vaughan P.S. Miura P. Henderson M. Byrne B. Vaughan K.T. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Moreover, dynein-dynactin interaction is also regulated by phosphorylation of the dynein intermediate chain (29Vaughan P.S. Leszyk K.D. Vaughan K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26171-26179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Spindle rotation in Xenopus oocytes at metaphase I may also be mediated by a dynactin-dynein mechanism. Accordingly, cortical F-actin is required for spindle rotation because rotation of metaphase I spindle is completely inhibited upon cytochalasin B treatment (30Gard D.L. Cha B.J. Roeder A.D. Zygote. 1995; 3: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, two components of the dynactin-dynein complex undergo coordinated phosphorylation during oocyte maturation (17Huang C.Y. Chang C.P. Huang C.L. Ferrell J.E., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14262-14269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this work we found that inhibition of Aurora A kinase blocks metaphase I plate rotation and metaphase I exit. We propose that the first phenomenon may be mediated by phosphorylation of one or several constituents of the dynactin-dynein complex, as for example the p150(Glued) protein or the intermediate chain of dynein. In an effort to characterize the second mechanism controlling meiosis I exit, we investigated whether the metaphase I arrest observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes was the result of a general block of the cell cycle. We found that normal meiotic cytoplasmic events, such as cyclin B2 degradation, proceed normally. Thus, we conclude that the arrest at first meiotic metaphase observed in α-Aurora A-microinjected oocytes is not correlated with a general block of the cell cycle. Meiotic metaphase II-arrested oocytes of vertebrates are believed to exit naturally this stage when cyclin degradation is triggered by fertilization or parthenogenetic activation (13Castro A. Peter M. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Vigneron S. Galas S. Lorca T. Labbé J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2660-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that oocytes with a metaphase I-arrested phenotype normally degrade cyclin B2 upon parthenogenetic activation. However, despite the fact that our data show a requirement of Aurora A during first meiosis inXenopus oocytes, we could not assess whether this kinase is also involved in the second meiotic anaphase because of the early phenotype observed. We conclude that the disruption of Aurora Ain vivo does not imply a block of the normal meiotic cytoplasmic cell cycle events. Moreover, our data reveal, for the first time, a requirement of the Aurora A kinase and Eg5 in the meiosis ofXenopus oocytes. We ask now how Aurora A impinges on the segregation of homologous chromosomes at first meiosis inXenopus. Thus, the Aurora kinases seem to be key factors not only in controlling mitotic events but also in the regulation of meiotic division. We are grateful to Pierre Travo, head of the IFR24 integrated imaging facility, for his constant interest and support."

However, the intermolecular forces driving integrin self-association are poorly understood. This work provides new insights into integrin clustering mechanisms by demonstrating how temperature and ligand binding interact to affect the oligomeric state of αIIbβ3. The ligand-free receptor, solubilized in thermostable octyl glucoside micelles, exhibited a cooperative transition at ∼43 °C, monitored by changes in intrinsic fluorescence and circular dichroism. Both signals changed in a direction opposite to that for global unfolding, and both were diminished upon binding the fibrinogen γ-chain ligand-mimetic peptide cHArGD. Free and bound receptors also exhibited differential sensitivity to temperature-enhanced oligomerization, as measured by dynamic light scattering, sedimentation velocity, and sedimentation equilibrium. Van't Hoff analyses of dimerization constants for αIIbβ3 complexed with cHArGD, cRGD, or eptifibatide yielded large, favorable entropy changes partly offset by unfavorable enthalpy changes. Transmission electron microscopy showed that ligand binding and 37 °C incubation enhanced assembly of integrin dimers and larger oligomers linked by tail-to-tail contacts. Interpretation of these images was aided by threading models for αIIbβ3 protomers and dimers based on the ectodomain structure of αvβ3.

The αIIbβ3complex is the classic example of a regulated integrin, a receptor whose affinity for adhesive macromolecules is modulated by changes in conformation and clustering (3Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Google Scholar, 4Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Google Scholar, 5Liddington R.C. Bankston L.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 37-43Google Scholar). The receptor is maintained in a default inactive state on circulating human blood platelets, possibly by interactions between the short cytoplasmic domains of the αIIb and β3 subunits or with integrin-associated proteins (6Vinogradova O. Haas T. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1450-1455Google Scholar, 7Ginsberg M.H. O'Toole T.E. Loftus J.C. Plow E.F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

A. 2002; 30: 5878-5883Google Scholar). According to this model, proteins like fibrinogen or fibronectin are prevented from binding to extracellular region of αIIbβ3 until a platelet stimulus, such as thrombin, binds to a G-protein-coupled receptor (3Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Google Scholar, 10Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Google Scholar, 11Payrastre B. Missy K. Trumel C. Bodin S. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1069-1074Google Scholar). A rapid cascade of intracellular events releases an inhibitory lock, sending a signal some 15 nm outwards to the ectodomain of αIIbβ3, where a rearrangement of intersubunit contacts leads to an “open” receptor with a functional binding site (12Faull R.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1091-1097Google Scholar, 13Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar, 14Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Google Scholar). This process of converting αIIbβ3 to an active form is referred to as “inside-out” signaling (3Shattil S.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 318-325Google Scholar). Receptor occupancy then sends an “outside-in” signal, leading to integrin clustering and downstream activation of kinases, especially focal adhesion kinase, that stabilize the integrin-mediated links between extracellular matrix proteins and actin filaments (15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Google Scholar, 16Hartwig J.H. Barkalow K. Azim A. Italiano J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 392-398Google Scholar, 17Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Google Scholar). Clustering of bound receptors may facilitate these processes by increasing the local concentration of integrin-associated proteins, especially those that bind to the cytoplasmic tail of β3(4Plow E.F.

Calderwood D.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3563-3571Google Scholar). A positive feedback mechanism may also be at work on the cell surface, in that integrin oligomers could be especially efficient at capturing multimeric adhesive proteins (15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Google Scholar, 20Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Science. 1995; 267: 883-885Google Scholar). Our understanding of the molecular basis for integrin activation has been considerably enhanced by the recent publication of crystal structures for the extracellular domain of the αvβ3 integrin, in the absence and presence of ligand (21Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Diefenbach B. Zhang R. Dunker R. Scott D.L. Joachimiak A. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2001; 294: 339-345Google Scholar, 22Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Google Scholar). However, many questions remain about the mechanistic details of the biomechanical coupling between the distant intra- and extracellular domains of αIIbβ3. Previous experiments have shown that truncating either the αIIb or β3 cytoplasmic regions yields a receptor that is constitutively active for inside-out signaling, indicating that communication between the cytoplasmic domains maintains the inactive state of the integrin (23O'Toole T.E. Mandelman D. Forsyth J. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Science. 1991; 254: 845-847Google Scholar, 24O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Google Scholar). We have recently shown that a truncation mutant, lacking the αIIb cytoplasmic domain, underwent further activation in the presence of a high affinity fibrinogen mimetic peptide resulting in the formation of oligomers (25Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del G.V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 82-95Google Scholar). These observations reinforce the concept that clustering plays a major role in the regulation of integrin affinity through outside-in signaling (13Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Google Scholar, 15Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Google Scholar, 26Li R. Babu C.R. Lear J.D. Wand A.J. Bennett J.S. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12462-12467Google Scholar). Concerning the forces that drive integrin clustering, we and others have demonstrated that the ability of RGDX peptides to block the function of αIIbβ3 (27Tranqui L. Andrieux A. Hudry-Clergeon G. Ryckewaert J.J. Soyez S. Chapel A. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Marguerie G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2519-2527Google Scholar) as well as to perturb the conformation of its ectodomain and to promote “tail to tail” oligomerization all increased with the hydrophobicity of the residue in the X-position (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar, 29Hantgan R.R. Stahle M.C. Jerome W.G. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 910-917Google Scholar). Likewise, we found that eptifibatide, a cyclized fibrinogen-mimetic peptide with a tryptophan residue in its integrin-targeting sequence (30Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Google Scholar), was especially effective at promoting αIIbβ3oligomerization, as monitored by sedimentation equilibrium and electron microscopy (31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar). These observations have led to the concept that nonpolar receptor-ligand interactions contribute to both integrin activation and self-association (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar, 31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar).

However, extracting thermodynamic data on a transmembrane protein such as the αIIbβ3integrin requires pure protein isolated in a thermally stable environment amenable to spectroscopic studies.

Chem. 2000; 104: 5462-5470Google Scholar) is especially well suited for biophysical characterizations of integral membrane proteins because it exhibits a critical micellar concentration and aggregation number that are nearly invariant from 20 to 60 °C (40Aoudia M. Zana R. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1998; 206: 158-167Google Scholar). Octyl glucoside has been used to study the structure and dynamics of bacteriorhodopsin (41Gottschalk M. Dencher N.A. Halle B. J.

Extensive biophysical characterizations have shown that octyl glucoside, even at a concentration well above its critical micellar concentration, does not perturb the quaternary structure of the soluble lens protein α-crystallin (45Aerts T.

Medved L.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 205-211Google Scholar) with biophysical characterizations of the αIIbβ3integrin in octyl glucoside, we recognize the limitations of extrapolation from a detergent-solubilized protein to the physiological situation. However, the responses of solubilized integrins to ligand binding, such as conformational changes and oligomerization (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar, 31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar), have been remarkably similar to the effects seen in cellular membranes (20Miyamoto S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M.

Shuman H. Bennett J.S. Weisel J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These observations probably reflect the fact that the ectodomain of αIIbβ3 contains >90% of the integrin residues and only one narrow nonpolar segment on each subunit traverses the plasma membrane (28Hantgan R.R.

Highly purified human fibrinogen (free of plasminogen and Factor XIII) was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) and highly purified human α-thrombin was from Sigma. Platelet-rich plasma and gel-filtered platelets were isolated from blood obtained by venipuncture from healthy, adult, volunteer donors as previously described (58Hantgan R.R. Blood. 1984; 64: 896-906Google Scholar). Platelet counts were determined with a Coulter MDII Cell Counter (Beckman Instruments, Miami, FL). Platelet αIIbβ3 occupancy was determined with flow cytometric analysis using a Biocytex kit BX7001 (Marseilles, France) (25Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del G.V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M.

Platelet aggregation profiles were obtained in a Chrono-Log model 500 aggregometer. Platelet adhesion to fibrin was determined in a microtiter plate adhesion assay with colorimetric read-out as previously described (25Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del G.V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 82-95Google Scholar). Milligram quantities of highly purified αIIbβ3 were isolated from outdated human blood platelets (American Red Cross, Triad Blood Center, Winston-Salem, NC) as previously described (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar, 49Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Google Scholar). Biophysical measurements were performed on peak integrin fractions obtained by size exclusion chromatography at 4 °C on a 0.9 × 85-cm column of Sephacryl S-300 equilibrated in pH 7.4 buffer (HSC-OG) containing 0.13 mol/liter NaCl, 0.01 mol/liter HEPES, 0.002 mol/liter CaCl2, 3 × 10−8 mol/liter basic trypsin inhibitor, 10−6 mol/liter leupeptin, 0.02% sodium azide, and 0.03 mol/litern-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Peak fractions were then concentrated in an Amicon pressure concentrator with a PLHK cellulose membrane, 100,000 Da retention limit (31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar). UV absorbance measurements were performed as a function of wavelength on a Beckman diode array spectrophotometer with αIIbβ3 samples contained in 1-cm path length, 0.1-ml volume quartz cuvettes. Circular dichroic spectroscopy was performed as a function of temperature from 20 to 60 °C in a Jasco model 720 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co., Tokyo) with samples in a thermostatted 0.05-cm path-length cuvette; data are expressed as molar ellipticity, [Θ],versus wavelength (25Hantgan R.R. Stahle M. Del G.V. Adams M. Lasher T. Jerome W.G. McKenzie M. Lyles D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1540: 82-95Google Scholar). In computing [Θ], each data set was corrected for the signal from the HSC-OG buffer or buffered octyl glucoside containing the ligand-mimetic peptide cHArGD at the same temperature. However, these background measurements changed by only ±5% over the range 20–60 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained over the same temperature range with an Aminco-Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer (SLM-Aminco, Rochester, NY) with samples contained in thermostatted quartz microcuvettes (Hellma Cells, Inc., White Plains, NY); an excitation wavelength at 278 nm was used (31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar). These data were also corrected for background fluorescence; the signal from HSC-OG buffer was found to vary by ±6% over the range 20–60 °C. The small fluorescence intensity from the tryptophan-containing ligand-mimetic peptide cHArGD in HSC-OG exhibited an ∼2-fold hyperbolic decrease with increasing temperature, as expected for intrinsic fluorescence measurements (60Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry. Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1980Google Scholar). Static and dynamic light scattering measurements were performed in a Brookhaven Instruments BI-2030 AT correlator operated in conjunction with a BI-200 SM light scattering photometer/photon counting detector and a Spectra Physics 127 He-Ne laser (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar); samples in quartz microcuvettes were contained in a thermostatted refractive index matching vat at temperatures in the range 20–40 °C. For translational diffusion coefficient determinations, each intensity-normalized photon count autocorrelation function obtained for the αIIbβ3 complex was first corrected for the contributions of octyl glucoside micelles. Following procedures described in our earlier work (49Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Google Scholar), the autocorrelation function was treated as an intensity-weighted sum of two exponential decay components, one corresponding to the macromolecule and the other to the faster moving detergent micelles. The contribution of the detergent was determined from separate measurements of buffered octyl glucoside, obtained under the same instrumental conditions. The resultant signal was weighted by its fractional intensity, then subtracted from the corresponding autocorrelation function for the integrin:detergent mixture to yield a corrected autocorrelation function. Each corrected autocorrelation function was then analyzed by the method of cumulants to obtain a z-average translational diffusion coefficient for the αIIbβ3 complex. Size distribution information was also obtained from these corrected autocorrelation functions with the CONTIN algorithm (61Provencher S.W. Comp. Phys. Commun. 1982; 27: 229-242Google Scholar). We note that CONTIN analysis did not consistently identify a peak corresponding to the ∼5-nm diameter OG micelles in the uncorrected data, probably because we worked under conditions where the detergent contributed less than 20% of the total scattering intensity. All translational diffusion coefficients reported here have been corrected for solvent viscosity to obtain D 20,w and Stokes radius (R s) values. Data collected from buffered HSC-OG indicated that the octyl glucoside micelle size distribution did not change appreciably from 20 to 40 °C in that the scattering intensity varied by ±13% and the mean particle diameter changed by ±12%; no temperature-dependent trends were observed in these data. Our results obtained with 30 mm OG are consistent with the report of Aoudia and Zana (40Aoudia M. Zana R. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1998; 206: 158-167Google Scholar), who found that both critical micellar concentration for octyl glucoside (23–25 mm) and aggregation number (107-92) exhibited minimal temperature dependence from 20 to 60 °C. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium measurements were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) equipped with absorbance optics and an An60 Ti rotor (28Hantgan R.R. Paumi C. Rocco M. Weisel J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14461-14464Google Scholar, 31Hantgan R.R. Rocco M. Nagaswami C. Weisel J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1614-1626Google Scholar). By always including HSC-OG buffer or buffer + ligand-mimetic peptide in the reference compartment, the resultant optical signals were corrected for any temperature-induced effects on the solvent, although data previously described demonstrated these effects to be minimal. Sedimentation velocity data obtained at 20 and 40 °C were analyzed using both SVEDBERG (version 1.04) and DCDT+ (version 6.31) software (J. Philo, Thousand Oaks, CA) to obtain the weight average sedimentation coefficient (s w) and distribution of sedimenting species, g(s*), respectively (62Stafford III, W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Google Scholar). All sedimentation coefficients reported here have been corrected for solvent density and viscosity to obtains 20,w values. The absorbance versus radial distance data obtained by sedimentation equilibrium were analyzed by nonlinear regression with WinNONLIN3 (63Johnson M. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Google Scholar) to obtain weight average molecular weights (M w) for the αIIbβ3complex alone and in the presence of ligand-mimetic peptide.M w data were analyzed for their dependence on rotor speed (at 6000 and 8000 rpm), a diagnostic for irreversible aggregation (64Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Google Scholar). In the absence of ligands, data obtained with αIIbβ3 yielded a ratioM w (6000 rpm)/M w (8000 rpm) of 0.905 at 30 °C, 0.839 at 37 °C, and 0.737 at 40 °C. In addition, global fits to data obtained at 37 and 40 °C yielded a variance of ∼3 × 10−3, a 5-fold decrease in quality compared with fits obtained with data at lower temperatures. These observations are indicative of thermal aggregation for the ligand-free integrin (64Laue T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 427-452Google Scholar). Because depletion of larger species can also influence the resultantM w data, the quantity of absorbing material present in cells containing αIIbβ3 at equilibrium was computed and compared with that initially added. This was done by numerical integration of the absorbance versusradial distance profiles obtained at 30 and 40 °C, as well as the initial, pre-equilibrium scans obtained at 3000 rpm. Whereas ∼100% recovery was achieved at 6000 rpm/30 °C, this parameter fell to ∼68% at 8000 rpm/30 °C; because only absorbance values <3.0 were included, there is some uncertainty associated with these estimates. In addition, only data at absorbence <1.5 were included in the subsequent analyses to ensure compliance with Beer's law, thus 47% of the integrated area was used for fitting at 6000 rpm and 42% at 8000 rpm. These effects became more pronounced at 40 °C where recoveries of 42 and 28% were obtained at 6000 and 8000 rpm, respectively; 33% of the 6000 rpm data and 25% of the 8000 rpm data were used for fitting. In contrast, M w data obtained for the ligand-bound integrins showed a somewhat less pronounced dependence on rotor speed and temperature: for example, the ratioM w (6000 rpm)/M w (8000 rpm) was 0.907 at 30 °C, 0.851 at 37 °C, and 0.765 at 40 °C for the αIIbβ3·cHArGD complex. Global fits of data obtained in this temperature range, at two rotor speeds, and receptor concentrations in the range 1.4 to 4.0 μm, yielded a variance of ∼7 × 10−4, indicating the data obtained for the ligand-bound integrin were more consistent with oligomerization, rather than the aggregation behavior observed for the free receptor. Sample depletion was also less pronounced with the ligand-bound integrin samples, as recoveries of 94 ± 10% and fitted ranges of 42 ±"

Thus, IL-4 plays a key role in the differentiation of native CD4+ T cells into Th2 T cells and in the regulation of apoptosis and growth of B cells. Furthermore, IL-4 induces B cell immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgG1 and IgE (reviewed in Refs. 1Paul W.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 208-216Google Scholar and 2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Google Scholar). Stimulation of the IL-4 receptor complex by IL-4 results in the activation of multiple signaling pathways, one of which involves signal transducers and activators of transcription-6 (STAT6). IL-4 induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 by IL-4 receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK-1 and JAK-3), which in turn leads to STAT6 dimerization and rapid translocation to the nucleus, where STAT6 acts as an activator of IL-4-specific gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 2Nelms K.

Studies of STAT6-deficient mice have shown that STAT6 plays a critical role in IL-4 signaling and the induction of allergy (4Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Google Scholar, 5Akira S. Stem Cell. 1999; 17: 138-146Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that IL-4, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, also induces serine phosphorylation of STAT6, but it is not known which role serine phosphorylation plays in the regulation of STAT6 signaling and which kinases and phosphatases are involved (6Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomäki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Google Scholar, 7Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Google Scholar).At present four major classes of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases (PPases) are known. These include two that are Ca2+-independent (PP1 and PP2A) and two that are Ca2+-dependent (PP2B (calcineurin) and PP2C). PP1 and PP2A are expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells and are reportedly involved in several signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 8Zolnierowicz S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1225-1235Google Scholarand 9Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first evidence that PP2A regulates IL-4-mediated STAT6 signaling.RESULTSTo measure the effect of calyculin A on phosphatase activity in intact cells, T cell lines were incubated with calyculin A for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere and washed extensively prior to analysis for PP1/PP2A activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, calyculin A induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PP1/PP2A activity. In contrast, the PP2B inhibitor, cyclosporin A, had no effect on PP1/PP2A activity even at concentrations that blocked CD3 antibody-induced proliferation (Ref. 18Liu J. Farmer J.D., Jr. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 267: 13115-13118Google Scholar; data not shown). To investigate whether PP1 and/or PP2A are involved in the regulation of STAT6, T cells were incubated with phosphatase inhibitors as described above, and total cell lysates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-STAT6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B(lane 5), incubation with calyculin A induced a change in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6. Similar results were obtained with other PP2A inhibitors (okadaic acid, endothall thioanhydride, Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–4) but not with inhibitors of PP1 (Tau, Fig. 1 B, lane 2) and PP2B (CyA, Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Similar effects of calyculin A on STAT6 electrophoretic mobility were observed in antigen-specific CD4+ T cell lines and T cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, indicating that the effect of PP2A inhibition is not limited to a specific cell line (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated STAT6 showed that calyculin A induces a strong increase of serine phosphorylation of STAT6 (Fig. 1 C), which is compatible with the induced change in electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the strong effect on serine phosphorylation, threonine phosphorylation was barely detectable following calyculin A treatment, indicating that calyculin A selectively modulates serine phosphorylation of STAT6.To further investigate the involvement of PP2A in the regulation of STAT6 phosphorylation, we studied the effect of purified phosphatasesin vitro. Total cell lysates from cutaneous T cells (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1–8) or Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 D, lanes 9–12) pretreated with or without calyculin A were incubated with purified PP1 or PP2A enzyme prior to analysis by Western blotting with anti-STAT6 antibody. As showed in Fig. 1 D, purified PP2A almost completely blocked the calyculin A-induced shift in electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 (lane 4 versus 2 and lane 10 versus 12). In parallel experiments purified PP2A enzyme had no effect on IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in either cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (data not shown). In contrast, purified PP1 had no effect on the calyculin A-induced mobility shift of STAT6 in cutaneous T cells (Fig. 1 D,lane 6 versus 2) and Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that inhibition of PP2A triggers serine-phosphorylation of STAT6 in vivo, which can be dephosphorylated by PP2A in vitro.In an attempt to identify the serine kinase responsible for the serine phosphorylation of STAT6, T cells were incubated with inhibitors of candidate serine kinases prior to treatment with calyculin A. Inhibitors of serine/threonine kinases such as MEK (PD098059), p38 MAPK (SB203580), JNK (PD169316), casein II-kinase (5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidasol), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin, LY294002), and the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor H7 had no effect on calyculin A-induced phosphorylation of STAT6 (Fig. 2,lanes 3–8 and data not shown). However, preincubation with staurosporine, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of serine/threonine-kinases (19Harris W. Hill C.H. Lewis E.J. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E. Drugs Future. 1993; 18: 727-735Google Scholar), was able to inhibit a calyculin A-induced mobility shift of STAT6 (Fig. 2, lane 10), suggesting that an as yet unidentified, staurosporine-sensitive serine kinase is involved in the regulation of serine phosphorylation of STAT6.Figure 2Staurosporine inhibits calyculin A-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of STAT6. In parallel experiments T cells were preincubated in medium (−), MEK inhibitor PD98059 at 50 μm (PD), p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 at 50 μm (SB), JNK inhibitor PD169316 at 25 μm (JNK), or staurosporine at 500 nm (STA) for 60 min before incubation in medium or calyculin A at 80 nm for an additional 60 min. Cells were lysed and analyzed by Western blotting anti-STAT6 polyclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because STAT6 mediates IL-4-induced gene activation and plays a critical role in cytokine-induced IgE responses, we addressed the question of whether PP2A regulates IL-4-mediated STAT6 activation. Accordingly, T cells were preincubated with calyculin A prior to stimulation with IL-4, and total cell lysates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-pY STAT6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3 A (upper panel), IL-4 induced a strong tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6. Preincubation with calyculin A did not affect the amount of IL-4-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 but triggered a significant change in the electrophoretic mobility of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 (Fig. 3 A, upper panel, lane 4 versus 3). Stripping and reprobing of the membrane with antibodies directed against total STAT6 and STAT4 showed that calyculin A induced a similar shift in electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 in IL-4-stimulated (and unstimulated) T cells (Fig. 3 A,middle panel, lanes 4 and 2), and that the electrophoretic mobility of STAT4 was unaffected by calyculin A (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). As shown in Fig. 3 B, preincubation with calyculin A did not have any effect on IL-4-induced JAK-1 activation.Figure 3A, calyculin A has no effect on IL-4-induced STAT6 tyrosine phosphorylation. T cells were pretreated without or with calyculin A (80 nm) for 60 min prior to stimulation with IL-4 (25 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cells were lysed thereafter, applied to SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures,” immunoblotted with anti-pY STAT6, stripped, and reblotted with anti-STAT6 and anti-STAT4. B, PPase inhibitors have no effect on JAK-1 activation. Cells were preincubated for 60 min in either medium (−, lanes 1 and5), tautomycin (Tau, 500 nm,lanes 2 and 6), calyculin A (CA, 80 nm, lanes 3 and 7), or cyclosporin A (CyA, 400 ng/ml, lanes 4 and 8) before they were either left unstimulated or stimulated with IL-4 (25 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cells were lysed, applied to SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-pY JAK-1, stripped, and reblotted with anti-JAK-1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To address whether PP2A modulates IL-4-induced nuclear translocation of STAT6, cells were treated with phosphatase inhibitors and analyzed for STAT6 distribution in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions. As expected, the PP2A inhibitor calyculin A induced a significant shift in electrophoretic mobility of cytosolic STAT6, whereas inhibitors of PP1 and PP2B did not (Fig. 4 A,upper panel). The amount of IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in the cytosol was unaffected by pretreatment with protein phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 4 A, upper panel). In contrast, phosphotyrosine STAT6 was almost completely absent in nuclear extracts from calyculin A-treated cells (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, lane 5 versus 4). Stripping and reblotting with an antibody against total STAT6 showed that STAT6 was present in the nuclear extracts and that IL-4 induced a significant increase in the amount of total STAT6 (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, lane 4 versus 1). Calyculin A did not inhibit the IL-4-mediated increase of total STAT6 in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, lane 5 versus 2) but induced a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 in nuclear extracts that was comparable (but not identical) to that seen in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4 A, lane 5, lower versus upper panel). In contrast to the inhibition of phosphotyrosine STAT6 by calyculin A, inhibitors of PP1 and PP2B had no effect on phosphotyrosine STAT6 (and total STAT6) in nuclear extracts (Fig. 4 A, lower panel).Figure 4A, PP2A regulates subcellular location of IL-4-induced STAT6. T lymphoma cells were left untreated or preincubated with tautomycin (Tau, 500 nm), calyculin A (CA, 80 nm), or cyclosporin A (CyA, 400 ng/ml) for 60 min. Thereafter cells were either left untreated or stimulated with IL-4 (25 ng/ml) for 15 min before being lysed. Cytoplasmic (upper panel) and nuclear (lower panel) extracts were prepared and subsequently immunoblotted with anti-pY STAT6, stripped, and reblotted with anti-STAT6. B, calyculin A treatment inhibits DNA binding of STAT6. Cytoplasmic extracts from T lymphoma cells preincubated without or with calyculin A (80 nm) for 60 min before IL-4 stimulation (lanes 3 and 4) for 15 min were analyzed by affinity purification of STAT proteins using a biotinylated DNA probe (IgE3(5)). STAT-DNA complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-STAT6. IP, immunoprecipitates. C, transient transfection in Jurkat J-TAg cells. Cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Pretreatment with 0, 20, or 40 nm calyculin A for 1 h was followed by stimulation without or with IL-4 (25 ng/ml) for 18 h. The numbers on the y axis represent relative luciferase activity, where the values obtained for each concentration of calyculin A in unstimulated cells were set at 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To address whether calyculin-induced serine phosphorylation influences the ability of STAT6 to bind promoter regions of IL-4 target genes, we took advantage of the oligonucleotide “fishing” assay (20Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Nordah M. Röpke C. Geisler C. Mustelin T. Dobson P. Svejgaard A. Ødum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6764-6769Google Scholar). In this assay, biotinylated oligonucleotide probes representing the STAT6-binding site from the IgE promoter were used to precipitate promoter-binding proteins (13Shen C-H. Stavnezer J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3395-3404Google Scholar). As shown elsewhere (21Eriksen K.W. Nielsen M. Kaltoft K. Svejgaard A. Nissen M.H. Röpke C. Ødum N. Exp. Clin. Immunogenet. 2001; 18: 233-241Google Scholar) and confirmed in Fig. 4 B (lane 3), IL-4 induced a strong binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 from the cytoplasm to the IgE oligonucleotide sequence. Although calyculin did not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in the cytosol (Fig. 4 A), preincubation with calyculin A almost completely blocked the binding of tyrosine phosphorylated STAT6 to the oligonucleotide probe (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that calyculin A-induced serine phosphorylation blocks the DNA binding function of STAT6. To investigate whether pretreatment with calyculin A also inhibits the transcriptional activity of IL-4-induced STAT6, we made a STAT6-responsive luciferase expression construct. As shown in Fig. 4 C luciferase expression induced after 18 h of IL-4 stimulation was completely inhibited by preincubation with calyculin A (20 and 40 nm).DISCUSSIONIn the present study we provide the first evidence that protein phosphatases are involved in the regulation of STAT6. Inhibition of PP1/PP2A phosphatase activity by calyculin A triggered serine phosphorylation and a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6. Two structurally different PP2A inhibitors, okadaic acid and endothall thioanhydride, also induced a significant shift in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6, whereas inhibitors of PP1 (tautomycin) and PP2B (cyclosporin A) did not, suggesting that PP2A rather than PP1 (and PP2B) plays a key role in the regulation of STAT6. This conclusion is in accordance with our observation that treatment of cell lysates with purified PP2A restored the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6, whereas incubation with PP1 enzyme did not. Phosphoamino acid analysis of STAT6 immunoprecipitated from T cells incubated with or without calyculin A showed that inhibition of PP2A leads to a strong increase in serine phosphorylation in vivo. In contrast, calyculin A did not induce threonine phosphorylation, suggesting that PP2A selectively regulates serine phosphorylation of STAT6.In an attempt to identify the kinase responsible for serine phosphorylation of STAT6, we took advantage of cell-permeable inhibitors of candidate serine kinases. It has recently been shown that calyculin A induces MAPK (ERK1/2) activation through a PD98059-sensitive pathway in T cells (17Woetmann A. Nielsen M. Christensen S.T. Brockdorff J. Kaltoft K. Engel A.-M. Skov S. Brender C. Geisler C. Svejgaard A. Rygaard J. Leick V. Ødum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10620-10625Google Scholar, 22Jain N. Zhang T. Fong S.L. Lim C.P. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3157-3167Google Scholar), and MAP and JNK kinases have been implicated in cytokine-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, and/or STAT5 (23Yamashita H., Xu, J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Google Scholar, 24Cao X. Lim C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31055-31061Google Scholar, 25Cao X. Lim C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21004-21011Google Scholar). Therefore, we explored the possible role of MAP and JNK kinase pathways in calyculin A-induced STAT6 phosphorylation. Despite an almost complete inhibition of ERK1/2 activation (data not shown), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 did not inhibit the effect of calyculin A on STAT6, indicating that the serine phosphorylation of STAT6 was not mediated via the MEK/MAPK pathway. In support of this conclusion, STAT6 lacks the PSXP MAPK consensus phosphorylation site found in STAT3 and STAT1 (7Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Google Scholar), and the PSP motif found in STAT5a and -5b (23Yamashita H., Xu, J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the P38 and JNK pathways also failed to inhibit the calyculin A-induced mobility shift of STAT6. In contrast, staurosporine inhibited the calyculin A effect on STAT6, suggesting that an as yet unidentified, staurosporine-sensitive kinase was responsible for calyculin A-induced serine phosphorylation of STAT6. This is in agreement with our previous findings that staurosporine blocks serine phosphorylation of STAT3 in response to PP2A inhibitors (17Woetmann A. Nielsen M. Christensen S.T. Brockdorff J. Kaltoft K. Engel A.-M. Skov S. Brender C. Geisler C. Svejgaard A. Rygaard J. Leick V. Ødum N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10620-10625Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that the level of serine phosphorylation of STAT6 results from a balance between phosphorylation by a constitutively active, staurosporine-sensitive kinase and dephosphorylation by PP2A. This hypothesis is supported by our finding that STAT6 is a substrate for PP2A in vitro. Alternatively, PP2A may function as a negative regulator of a staurosporine-sensitive kinase.Our observation that calyculin A did not inhibit IL-4-induced activation of JAK-1 and STAT6 indicates that PP2A is not involved in the initial signaling events following IL-4R ligation. This conclusion was in accordance with our finding that inhibition of PP2A activity did not inhibit IL-4-mediated translocation of STAT6 to the nucleus. Because we were unable to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 in the nucleus of IL-4-stimulated cells, it appears that calyculin A treatment induced nuclear tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT6. Alternatively, calyculin A might induce re-export from the nucleus of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6. A more trivial explanation could be that calyculin A, directly or indirectly, interfered with antibody recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 isolated from the nucleus. However, our observation that antibody recognition of tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 obtained from the cytosolic fraction was unaffected by calyculin A strongly argues against this possibility.It has been a matter of some controversy as to how serine phosphorylation modulates the function of STAT proteins. Thus, serine phosphorylation has been reported to increase or decrease the level of tyrosine phosphorylation and/or the transcriptional activity of STAT1, STAT3, and/or STAT5 (22Jain N. Zhang T. Fong S.L. Lim C.P. Cao X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3157-3167Google Scholar, 26Wen Z. Zhong Z Darnell J.E., Jr. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Google Scholar, 27Eilers A. Georgellis D. Klose B. Schindler C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11107-11112Google Scholar). Two recent papers reported that IL-4 induces serine phosphorylation of STAT6 (6Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomäki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Google Scholar, 7Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Google Scholar), but the authors were not able to ascribe any functional effect of serine phosphorylation on the STAT6 signaling pathway. Here we show that inhibition of PP2A induces serine phosphorylation and inhibition of both the DNA binding capacity and the transcriptional activity of STAT6.Because a major site for serine phosphorylation lies within the known transactivation domain of STAT6 (7Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Google Scholar), it is possible that inhibition of STAT6 binding to the IgE promoter is caused by calyculin A-mediated serine phosphorylation of the transactivation domain. Studies are in progress to address this hypothesis. In conclusion, we have provided the first evidence that PP2A regulates cytokine-mediated STAT6 signaling. IL-41 is an important cytokine, which regulates the growth, differentiation, and survival of a variety of cell types. Thus, IL-4 plays a key role in the differentiation of native CD4+ T cells into Th2 T cells and in the regulation of apoptosis and growth of B cells. Furthermore, IL-4 induces B cell immunoglobulin isotype switching to IgG1 and IgE (reviewed in Refs. 1Paul W.E. CIBA Found. Symp. 1997; 204: 208-216Google Scholar and 2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Google Scholar). Stimulation of the IL-4 receptor complex by IL-4 results in the activation of multiple signaling pathways, one of which involves signal transducers and activators of transcription-6 (STAT6). IL-4 induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 by IL-4 receptor-associated Janus kinases (JAK-1 and JAK-3), which in turn leads to STAT6 dimerization and rapid translocation to the nucleus, where STAT6 acts as an activator of IL-4-specific gene transcription (reviewed in Refs. 2Nelms K. Keegan A.D. Zamorano J. Ryan J.J. Paul W.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 701-738Google Scholar and 3Wurster A.L. Tanaka T. Grusby M.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2577-2584Google Scholar). Studies of STAT6-deficient mice have shown that STAT6 plays a critical role in IL-4 signaling and the induction of allergy (4Kaplan M.H. Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J. Immunity. 1996; 4: 313-319Google Scholar, 5Akira S. Stem Cell. 1999; 17: 138-146Google Scholar). Recent reports suggest that IL-4, in addition to tyrosine phosphorylation, also induces serine phosphorylation of STAT6, but it is not known which role serine phosphorylation plays in the regulation of STAT6 signaling and which kinases and phosphatases are involved (6Pesu M. Takaluoma K. Aittomäki S. Lagerstedt A. Saksela K. Kovanen P.E. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 2000; 95: 494-502Google Scholar, 7Wick K.R. Berton M.T. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 641-652Google Scholar). At present four major classes of serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatases (PPases) are known. These include two that are Ca2+-independent (PP1 and PP2A) and two that are Ca2+-dependent (PP2B (calcineurin) and PP2C). PP1 and PP2A are expressed ubiquitously in eukaryotic cells and are reportedly involved in several signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 8Zolnierowicz S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1225-1235Google Scholarand 9Janssens V. Goris J. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 417-439Google Scholar). Here, we provide the first evidence that PP2A regulates IL-4-mediated STAT6 signaling. RESULTSTo measure the effect of calyculin A on phosphatase activity in intact cells, T cell lines were incubated with calyculin A for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere and washed extensively prior to analysis for PP1/PP2A activity. As shown in Fig. 1 A, calyculin A induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of PP1/PP2A activity. In contrast, the PP2B inhibitor, cyclosporin A, had no effect on PP1/PP2A activity even at concentrations that blocked CD3 antibody-induced proliferation (Ref. 18Liu J. Farmer J.D., Jr. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 267: 13115-13118Google Scholar; data not shown). To investigate whether PP1 and/or PP2A are involved in the regulation of STAT6, T cells were incubated with phosphatase inhibitors as described above, and total cell lysates were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-STAT6 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 B(lane 5), incubation with calyculin A induced a change in the electrophoretic mobility of STAT6. Similar results were obtained with other PP2A inhibitors (okadaic acid, endothall thioanhydride, Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–4) but not with inhibitors of PP1 (Tau, Fig. 1 B, lane 2) and PP2B (CyA, Fig. 1 B, lane 6). Similar effects of calyculin A on STAT6 electrophoretic mobility were observed in antigen-specific CD4+ T cell lines and T cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, indicating that the effect of PP2A inhibition is not limited to a specific cell line (data not shown). Phosphoamino acid analysis of immunoprecipitated STAT6 showed that calyculin A induces a strong increase of serine phosphorylation of STAT6 (Fig. 1 C), which is compatible with the induced change in electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 (Fig. 1 B). In contrast to the strong effect on serine phosphorylation, threonine phosphorylation was barely detectable following calyculin A treatment, indicating that calyculin A selectively modulates serine phosphorylation of STAT6.To further investigate the involvement of PP2A in the regulation of STAT6 phosphorylation, we studied the effect of purified phosphatasesin vitro.

As showed in Fig. 1 D, purified PP2A almost completely blocked the calyculin A-induced shift in electrophoretic mobility of STAT6 (lane 4 versus 2 and lane 10 versus 12). In parallel experiments purified PP2A enzyme had no effect on IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT6 in either cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (data not shown). In contrast, purified PP1 had no effect on the calyculin A-induced mobility shift of STAT6 in cutaneous T cells (Fig. 1 D,lane 6 versus 2) and Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Taken together these data indicate that inhibition of PP2A triggers serine-phosphorylation of STAT6 in vivo, which can be dephosphorylated by PP2A in vitro.In an attempt to identify the serine kinase responsible for the serine phosphorylation of STAT6, T cells were incubated with inhibitors of candidate serine kinases prior to treatment with calyculin A.

However, preincubation with staurosporine, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of serine/threonine-kinases (19Harris W. Hill C.H. Lewis E.J. Nixon J.S. Wilkinson S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1967487813,"A ligand-independent activator of heterotrimeric brain G-protein was partially purified from detergent-solubilized extracts of the neuroblastoma-glioma cell hybrid NG108-15. The G-protein activator (NG108-15 G-protein activator (NG-GPA)) increased [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) ([35S]GTPγS) to purified brain G-protein in a magnesium-dependent manner and promoted GDP dissociation from Gαo. The NG-GPA also increased GTPγS binding to purified, recombinant Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo, but minimally altered nucleotide binding to purified transducin. The NG-GPA increased GTPγS binding to membrane-bound G-proteins and inhibited basal, forskolin- and hormone-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in DDT1-MF-2 cell membranes. In contrast to G-protein coupled receptor-mediated activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins in DDT1-MF-2 cell membrane preparations, the action of the NG-GPA was not altered by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin. ADP-ribosylation of purified brain G-protein also failed to alter the increase in GTPγS binding elicited by the NG-GPA. Thus, the NG-GPA acts in a manner distinct from that of a G-protein coupled receptor and other recently described receptor-independent activators of G-protein signaling. These data indicate the presence of unexpected regulatory domains on Gi/Go proteins and suggest the existence of pertussis toxin-insensitive modes of signal input to Gi/Go signaling systems.

The NG-GPA also increased GTPγS binding to purified, recombinant Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo, but minimally altered nucleotide binding to purified transducin.

These cell-type specific differences in G-protein activation are often independent of the type and/or amount of G-protein expressed by the cell, indicating the existence of additional non-receptor proteins that regulate the activation state of heterotrimeric G-proteins by influencing nucleotide exchange, nucleotide hydrolysis, and/or subunit interactions.

Most such regulatory proteins identified to date preferentially interact with the G-proteins Gi, Go, and Gz and exert varying effects on nucleotide exchange, nucleotide hydrolysis, and subunit interactions. An expression cloning system developed to identify the NG-GPA led to the isolation of AGS1 to AGS3, which interact with different conformations or subunits of G-proteins and activate the signaling system by distinct mechanisms (2Cismowski M.

The NG-GPA, which increased GTPγS binding to Gi2, Gi3, and Go, is clearly distinct from AGS2 and AGS3. In contrast to the activation of G-proteins by a GPCR, AGS1, and other accessory proteins, the effect of the NG-GPA on GTPγS binding to brain G-protein and membrane bound G-proteins was not altered by ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins with pertussis toxin. These data indicate that the NG-GPA likely interacts with unexpected regulatory domains on Gα subunits and suggest the existence of pertussis toxin-insensitive modes of signal input to Gi/Go signaling systems. [32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) and [α-32P]GTP (800 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. G-proteins were purified from bovine brain as described and consisted of ∼63% GoA, 4% GoB, 16% GoC, 16% Gi1, 1% Gi2 (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Gαo and Gαi1–3 were expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells and kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Graber. All other materials were obtained as described previously (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D.

The partially purified preparations of the NG-GPA were generated essentially as described previously (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Five independent preparations were generated from the one large scale culture of cells with some variability in the relative degree of enrichment. Harvested cells were lysed, and membranes were solubilized with 1% Thesit (detergent:protein ratio of 2:1) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA. Detergent extracts were then fractionated by DEAE ion exchange, ultrafiltration, gel filtration, and lectin affinity chromatography (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide binding to purified brain G-protein or cell membranes was determined essentially as described previously (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 56, 651–656Google Scholar) with the exception that the solution phase assays in the present study used 1.25 nm G-protein and assay volume was 50 μl. In each experiment, parallel samples containing NG-GPA without G-protein were processed to determine the background binding of [35S]GTPγS to any guanine nucleotide-binding proteins co-fractionating with the NG-GPA. This level of background binding to NG-GPA fractions under standard incubation conditions described above was approximately equal to that of [35S]GTPγS binding to brain G-protein alone. Gαo (20 nm) was incubated in the presence or absence (vehicle) of the NG-GPA in buffer containing 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.3 μl of [α-32P]GTP, 1 μm GTP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mmMgCl2 in a total volume of 200 μl with 0.005% Thesit at 30 °C for 20 min. Samples were then cooled to 24 °C and dissociation initiated by addition of 1 mm GDP. 10-μl aliquots of the 200-μl samples were processed by vacuum filtration just prior to addition of GDP and at increasing times following the addition of GDP. Brain G-protein was treated with pertussis toxin as previously described (23Carty D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of ADP-ribosylation of brain Go by pertussis toxin was determined by “back ADP-ribosylation” of an aliquot of the treated material using [32P]NAD. Adenylyl cyclase activity assays were conducted in DDT1-MF2 cells stably transfected with the α2-A/D adrenergic receptor (21Marjamaki A. Sato M. Bouet-Alard R. Yang Q. Limon-boulez I. Legrand C. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16466-16467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A large scale preparation of cells obtained from the Finnish Biotechnology Institute (yield ∼826 mg of membrane protein) was solubilized and fractionated exactly as described previously (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to generate partially purified NG-GPA. The NG-GPA increased nucleotide binding to G-protein over a time course of 150 min compared with the nucleotide binding obtained with G-protein alone (Fig. 1 A). The action of the NG-GPA required the divalent cation magnesium (Fig. 1 B) and was dependent upon the concentration of NG-GPA (Fig. 1 C). Assays normally involved preincubation of the NG-GPA with G-protein for 1 h at 4 °C (1Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The action of the NG-GPA did not require preincubation, although a lag phase in the augmented GTPγS binding was observed when all assay components were mixed at time 0 (Fig. 1 D). Radioiodination of the peak activity fraction obtained from size exclusion chromatography revealed six major and six minor species following SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 2C. Ribas and S. M. Lanier, unpublished observations. In addition to activating bovine brain G-protein, the NG-GPA also increased GTPγS binding to recombinant Gαo, Gαi2, and Gαi3 (Fig. 2 A). The augmented GTPγS binding observed with the NG-GPA involved accelerated dissociation of GDP from Gαo subunit (Fig. 2 B). The NG-GPA had little effect on nucleotide binding to purified transducin, Gαs, or Gαq.2 The magnitude of activation of Gαo was greater than that observed with Gαi2/3, and the G-protein selectivity of the NG-GPA was further addressed in a functional assay in cell membranes. The NG-GPA inhibited basal as well as forskolin- and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Fig. 2 C) in membranes prepared from DDT1-MF-2 cells. Within the family of pertussis toxin sensitive G-proteins, DDT1-MF-2 cells express Gαi2/Gαi3 but not Go or Gαi1. These data indicate that the G-protein activator not only increases nucleotide binding to purified G-protein from bovine brain and recombinant Gαo and Gαi but also activates membrane bound G-proteins that lead to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Thus the NG-GPA is clearly distinct from AGS2 and AGS3, which were isolated in an expression cloning system with a NG108-15 cDNA library (2Cismowski M. Takesono A., Ma, C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J.

The action of AGS2 and AGS3 in the yeast functional screen does not require nucleotide exchange by Gαi (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). AGS2 apparently interacts with Gβγ, whereas AGS3, although it binds Gαi, stabilizes the GDP-bound conformation of Gαi and actually inhibits GTPγS binding (3Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C.

Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The action of the NG-GPA is more similar to that of a GPCR or AGS1 (2Cismowski M. Takesono A., Ma, C. Lizano J.S. Xie X. Fuernkranz H. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar,27Cismowski M.J., Ma, C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further characterize the NG-GPA, we asked whether it shares similar properties with a GPCR in terms of its interaction with Gi/Go proteins. Several lines of evidence point to the carboxyl terminus of the G-protein α subunit as one of the regions involved in the coupling between G-protein and membrane-bound receptor. Covalent modification of Cys near the carboxyl terminus in Gi/Go by pertussis toxin effectively prevents agonist-induced receptor interaction with G-protein, and a similar uncoupling of receptor and G-protein is observed with peptides derived from the carboxyl terminus of various Gα subunits. Surprisingly, the increase in GTPγS binding to membrane-bound G-proteins elicited by the NG-GPA was not blocked by pertussis toxin pretreatment of cells (Fig. 3A). Receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins in the same membranes was completely blocked by pertussis toxin treatment as expected (Fig. 3 A). This issue was further addressed with purified brain G-protein. ADP-ribosylation of brain Gi/Go with pertussis toxin also did not alter the increase in GTPγS binding observed in the presence of the NG-GPA (Fig. 3 B). The apparent insensitivity of G-protein activation by the NG-GPA to pertussis toxin treatment also renders it distinct from AGS1 (27Cismowski M.J., Ma, C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S.

PCP2 was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using Gαo as bait and reported to increase the dissociation of GDP from Gαo (19Luo Y. Denker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10685-10688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, other reports provide strong evidence that PCP2, by virtue of its G-protein regulatory motifs, actually inhibits GTPγS binding to Gi and Go(20Natochin M. Gasimov K.G. Artemyev N.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5322-5328Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Kimple R.J. Kimple M.E. Betts L. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Nature. 2002; 416: 878-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The NG-GPA is apparently interacting with a regulatory domain(s) on Gi/Go proteins distinct from the regions that are key for G-protein regulation by a GPCR and other proteins that influence the activation state of Gi/Go proteins. Of particular note is that these data indicate that modification of Gi/Goby pertussis toxin may not prevent the activation of these G-proteins within the cell by non-receptor proteins. The NG-GPA and related accessory proteins provide unexpected mechanisms for regulation of the G-protein activation cycle. In addition to the obvious interest related to GPCR signaling, such proteins may also provide alternative binding partners for G-protein subunits that allow G-proteins to serve functions within the cell unrelated to a GPCR. As such, these proteins and the concepts advanced with their discovery provide unexpected avenues for therapeutics and understanding disease mechanisms. We appreciate the input of Dr. Stephen Graber (Department of Pharmacology, West Virginia University School of Medicine) and the gift of recombinant Gi and Go. We also thank Dr. Elliott Ross (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern School of Medicine) for recombinant Gs and Gq and Dr. Heidi Hamm (Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine) for bovine transducin.
