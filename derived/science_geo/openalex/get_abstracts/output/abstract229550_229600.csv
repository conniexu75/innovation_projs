These fungi use extracellular oxidative enzymes that are also able to transform related aromatic compounds found in explosive contaminants, pesticides and toxic waste. We have sequenced the 30-million base-pair genome of Phanerochaete chrysosporium strain RP78 using a whole genome shotgun approach. The P. chrysosporium genome reveals an impressive array of genes encoding secreted oxidases, peroxidases and hydrolytic enzymes that cooperate in wood decay. Analysis of the genome data will enhance our understanding of lignocellulose degradation, a pivotal process in the global carbon cycle, and provide a framework for further development of bioprocesses for biomass utilization, organopollutant degradation and fiber bleaching. This genome provides a high quality draft sequence of a basidiomycete, a major fungal phylum that includes important plant and animal pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W1972380090,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common inherited neuromuscular disease and is characterized by considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity. We previously reported a Russian family with autosomal dominant axonal CMT and assigned the locus underlying the disease (CMT2F; OMIM 606595) to chromosome 7q11-q21 (ref. 2). Here we report a missense mutation in the gene encoding 27-kDa small heat-shock protein B1 (HSPB1, also called HSP27) that segregates in the family with CMT2F. Screening for mutations in HSPB1 in 301 individuals with CMT and 115 individuals with distal hereditary motor neuropathies (distal HMNs) confirmed the previously observed mutation and identified four additional missense mutations. We observed the additional HSPB1 mutations in four families with distal HMN and in one individual with CMT neuropathy. Four mutations are located in the Hsp20-alpha-crystallin domain, and one mutation is in the C-terminal part of the HSP27 protein. Neuronal cells transfected with mutated HSPB1 were less viable than cells expressing the wild-type protein. Cotransfection of neurofilament light chain (NEFL) and mutant HSPB1 resulted in altered neurofilament assembly in cells devoid of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments."

https://openalex.org/W2019313913,"Distal hereditary motor neuropathies are pure motor disorders of the peripheral nervous system resulting in severe atrophy and wasting of distal limb muscles1. In two pedigrees with distal hereditary motor neuropathy type II linked to chromosome 12q24.3, we identified the same mutation (K141N) in small heat-shock 22-kDa protein 8 (encoded by HSPB8; also called HSP22). We found a second mutation (K141E) in two smaller families. Both mutations target the same amino acid, which is essential to the structural and functional integrity of the small heat-shock protein αA-crystallin2. This positively charged residue, when mutated in other small heat-shock proteins, results in various human disorders3,4. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed greater binding of both HSPB8 mutants to the interacting partner HSPB1. Expression of mutant HSPB8 in cultured cells promoted formation of intracellular aggregates. Our findings provide further evidence that mutations in heat-shock proteins have an important role in neurodegenerative disorders."

Complex gangliosides are requisite for efficient binding to neuronal cells, but protein receptors are critical for internalization. Recent work evidenced that synaptotagmins I and II can function as protein receptors for BoNT/B (Dong, M., Richards, D. A., Goodnough, M. C., Tepp, W. H., Johnson, E. A., and Chapman, E. R. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 162, 1293–1303). Here, we report the protein receptor for a second BoNT serotype. Like BoNT/B, BoNT/G employs synaptotagmins I and II to enter phrenic nerve cells. Using pull-down assays we show that only BoNT/G, but neither the five remaining BoNTs nor tetanus neurotoxin, interacts with synaptotagmins I and II. In contrast to BoNT/B, interactions with both isoforms are independent of the presence of gangliosides. Peptides derived from the luminal domain of synaptotagmin I and II are capable of blocking the neurotoxicity of BoNT/G in phrenic nerve preparations. Pull-down and neutralization assays further established the membrane-juxtaposed 10 luminal amino acids of synaptotagmins I and II as the critical segment for neurotoxin binding. In addition, we show that the carboxyl-terminal domain of the cell binding fragment of BoNT/B and BoNT/G mediates the interaction with their protein receptor.

Clostridial neurotoxins (CNTs) 1The abbreviations used are: CNT, clostridial neurotoxin; BoNT, botulinum neurotoxin; HC, heavy chain; HCC, carboxyl-terminal domain of the HC; HCN, amino-terminal domain of the HC; HN, amino terminal half of the heavy chain; LC, light chain; scBoNT, single chain BoNT; Syt, synaptotagmin; TeNT, tetanus neurotoxin; RT, room temperature; GST, glutathione S-transferase. are extremely potent bacterial toxins. Among them, the seven serologically distinct botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs, serotypes A-G) cause botulism, whereas the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) provokes the disease tetanus. Each neurotoxin is composed of four domains. Their light chains (LCs) act as zinc-dependent endopeptidases and specifically hydrolyze certain proteins of the vesicular fusion machinery, whereupon the Ca2+-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane is disrupted (reviewed in Refs. 1Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Bigalke H. Shoer L.F. Aktories K. Just I. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 145.

The heavy chains (HCs) are tethered to the LCs via a single disulfide bond and encompass the three remaining domains. The HC serves as the vehicle that delivers the LC to the cytosol of neuronal cells. Therefore, the extreme toxicity has to be largely ascribed to the specific binding of the molecule to nerve terminals at the neuromuscular junction. The amino-terminal segment of the HC, the HN domain, is responsible for translocating the LC from the lumen of an acidic intracellular compartment into the cytosol subsequent to cell binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis. The carboxyl-terminal segment of the HC, the so-called HC-fragment (HC), comprises two domains, HCN and HCC. The latter was shown in the case of TeNT to suffice for cell binding (4Halpern J.L. Loftus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11188-11192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and internalization (5Herreros J. Lalli G. Schiavo G. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). TeNT travels retrogradely and eventually arrives at inhibitory inter-neurons in the spinal cord where it provokes spastic paralysis. So far, the corresponding domain has not been identified for BoNTs, which in contrast act locally at motoneurons and cause flaccid paralysis. No function could yet be attributed to the HCN domain. It has long been known that polysialogangliosides, i.e. glycosphingolipids that are particularly enriched in the outer leaflet of neuronal cell membranes, are crucial for the binding of CNTs to neurons. TeNT and BoNTs exhibit affinities in the high nm range for isolated polysialogangliosides. The binding of CNTs to neuronal tissue, however, exhibits yet much higher affinities (reviewed in Ref. 6Halpern J.L. Neale E.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 195: 221-242PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy as well as other findings led to the proposal of the now confirmed two-receptor model (7Montecucco C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 314-317Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (333) Google Scholar). This model suggests that the abundant polysialogangliosides trap and accumulate CNTs in the plane of the cell membrane. Here, the neurotoxins wait until achieving contact with their sparsely occurring protein receptor(s), which are assumed to mediate the subsequent specific endocytosis. Synaptotagmin (Syt)-I and Syt-II, two homologous membrane-anchored proteins of synaptic vesicles (8Perin M.S. Fried V.A. Mignery G.A. Jahn R. Südhof T.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), were demonstrated to interact with BoNT/B in the presence of GT1b (12Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M.

Lett. 1996; 208: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, it was conclusively shown that their luminal domain, which becomes temporarily exposed at the synaptic cleft upon fusion of synaptic vesicles, interacts with BoNT/B and mediates the entry of BoNT/B into neurons (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether other CNTs than BoNT/B can utilize Syt-I or Syt-II as protein receptors. Our results establish that BoNT/G interacts directly with both Syt-I and Syt-II in a ganglioside-independent fashion. Moreover, neutralization studies employing peptides derived from the luminal domain of Syt-I or Syt-II effectively block the toxicity of BoNT/G in mouse phrenic nerve preparations. Thus, the interaction of BoNT/G with Syt-I or Syt-II is crucial for its entry into motor nerve terminals. Plasmid Constructions and Recombinant Proteins—Plasmids encoding full-length BoNT/A and BoNT/B as well as the HC-fragments of TeNT, BoNT/A, and BoNT/B were described previously (16Rummel A. Bade S. Alves J. Bigalke H. Binz T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 17Rummel A. Mahrhold S. Bigalke H. Binz T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Corresponding constructs for the expression of BoNT/C, -D, -E, -F, and -G HC-fragments carrying a carboxyl-terminal StrepTag were generated by using PCR with suitable primers and purified bacteriophage DNA (BoNT/C and -D) or total bacterial DNA (BoNT/E, strain NCTC 11219; BoNT/F, strain NCTC 10281; BoNT/G (Clostridium argentinense)) as template DNA. Plasmids for Escherichia coli expression of carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged HCN and HCC domains of BoNT/A, -B, and -G were constructed by PCR using suitable primers and pQE3 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as parental vector. A plasmid encoding full-length BoNT/G with carboxyl-terminal StrepTag (pBoNTG-wt) was assembled from LC and HN domain-encoding DNA pieces obtained by PCR in the HC-encoding vector. An expression plasmid (pBoNTG-thro) for full-length BoNT/G comprising a thrombin cleavage site between L and HN was constructed in the same manner. Truncated variants of rat Syt-I (1–82, 1–53, 1–43), rat Syt-II (1–90, 1–61, 1–51), and rat Syt-III (1–80) were cloned in pGEX-2T. Nucleotide sequences of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant full-length neurotoxins and the various HC-derived fragments were produced utilizing the E. coli strain M15[pREP4] (Qiagen) during 10 h of induction at RT and purified on Strep-Tactin (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. GST fusion proteins obtained from E. coli TG1 were purified employing glutathione-Sepharose beads. Fractions containing the desired proteins were pooled and dialyzed against Tris/NaCl buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) or, in the case of neurotoxins, directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70 °C. GST fusion proteins used for pull-down experiments were prepared in Tris/NaCl buffer supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Tris/NaCl/Triton buffer). Syt-I-1–53 and Syt-II-1–61 were also extracted from the respective GST fusion proteins using the thrombin cleavage site present between the GST and Syt sections by applying thrombin (Roche Applied Science) in a 1:100 mass ratio for 2 h at RT. Thrombin was subsequently inactivated using phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride. GST Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins (0.14 nmol each) immobilized to 10 μl of GT-Sepharose beads were incubated with full-length neurotoxins, HC-fragments, HCN or HCC domains (0.06 nmol each) in the absence or presence of a bovine brain ganglioside mixture (18% GM1, 55% GD1a, 10% GT1b, and 2% other gangliosides; 5 μg each; Calbiochem) in a total volume of 200 μl of Tris/NaCl/Triton buffer for 90 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times each with 35 bed volumes of the same buffer. Washed pellet fractions were boiled in SDS sample buffer and analyzed together with supernatant fractions by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Mouse Phrenic Nerve Assays—The mouse phrenic nerve assay was set up as described by Habermann et al. (18Habermann E. Dreyer F. Bigalke H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 311: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve was performed continuously at a frequency of 1 Hz. Isometric contractions were recorded with a force transducer and analyzed with VitroDat Online software (FMI GmbH, Seeheim, Germany). The time required to reduce the amplitude to 50% of the starting value (paralytic half-time) was determined. Recombinant BoNT/G-thro was applied in triplicate at final concentrations of 2.0, 6.0, 20.0, and 60.0 nm. A concentration-response curve could be described by the power function y = 128.13x-0.2646 (R2 = 0.9838). A concentration-response curve described by the power function y = 69.11x-0.2662 (R2 = 0.9855) was obtained in the same manner for recombinant single chain BoNT/B (scBoNT/B) applying final concentrations of 195.4, 651.4, and 1954 pm. For inhibition studies scBoNT/A, scBoNT/B, and BoNT/G-thro were mixed with various concentrations of Syt-I- or Syt-II-derived peptides, incubated for 15 min at RT, and subsequently added to the hemidiaphragm preparation. Paralytic half-times measured in the presence of peptides were converted to corresponding concentrations of the respective isolated BoNTs using the equations mentioned above. Resulting toxicities were finally expressed as percentage of inhibition of toxicity. Individual inhibition experiments were conducted three to six times. BoNT/G Directly Interacts with the Luminal Domain of Syt-I and Syt-II—Previous studies demonstrated that Syt-I and Syt-II interact with BoNT/B (12Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10498-10503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nishiki T. Tokuyama Y. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Yoshida A. Sato K. Sekiguchi M. Takahashi M.

Lett. 1996; 208: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and mediate its internalization (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In contrast, the entry of BoNT/A and BoNT/E does not depend on the presence of Syt-I and Syt-II (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To screen whether any of the remaining CNTs utilizes interaction with Syts to enter neuronal cells, we analyzed binding of their HC-fragments to Syt-I and Syt-II in vitro. We conducted GST pull-down experiments employing fusion proteins in which the entire luminal and transmembrane domains of rat Syt-I and Syt-II was fused to GST. As demonstrated in Fig. 1B, GST·Syt-I-1–82 and GST·Syt-II-1–90 pull down the HC-fragments of BoNT/B and BoNT/G. The finding with BoNT/B agrees with results of Dong and colleagues (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar); the finding with BoNT/G constitutes a novel result. Binding of HCB and HCGtoGST·Syt-II-1–90 is saturable and reaches a 1:1 stoichiometry at saturation (3-fold molar excess of HC; data not shown). We also detected traces of HC-fragments of BoNT/A and BoNT/E pulled down with GST·Syt-I-1–82 and GST·Syt-II-1–90 (Fig. 1B, arrowheads). This interaction appears to be unspecific, as HCA is pulled down to a similar extent by GST·Syb2 and GST·Syt-III-1–80 (Fig. 1C), and probably explains data of a previous report about the binding of BoNT/A and BoNT/E to Syt-I (19Li L. Singh B.R. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 215-226PubMed Google Scholar). To substantiate the newly discovered BoNT/G-Syt interaction, we studied the binding of the full-length neurotoxin as well. For this, we constructed expression plasmids producing BoNT/G fused to a carboxyl-terminal StrepTag. One variant (scBoNT/G-wt) comprised the native loop region between the two cystein residues that form the interchain disulfide bridge. In a second variant (BoNT/G-thro), a recognition site for thrombin was inserted in this region at the expense of four of the original amino acids (Fig. 2A). Both neurotoxin variants could be isolated from E. coli lysates via their affinity tag and exhibited >85% purity (Fig. 2B). BoNT/G-wt was used for in vitro binding studies as single chain protein. Full-length scBoNT/G-wt also interacts with Syt-I and Syt-II, whereas no binding was observed for scBoNT/A, underscoring that the pull down of HCA is indeed unspecific (Fig. 3, middle panel).Fig. 3The binding of full-length BoNT/G to Syt-I does not depend upon the presence of gangliosides. Binding assays were conducted as outlined in the legend to Fig. 1. However, binding assays were conducted partly in the absence of gangliosides. Asterisks denote breakdown and byproducts of GST fusion proteins. Arrowheads indicate truncated Strep-tagged BoNT/G fragments that also bound specifically to GST·Syt-II-1–90. These fragments are difficult to detect in GST·Syt-I-1–82, because they co-migrate with a byproduct of this fusion protein. Notably, BoNT/B does not, but BoNT/G does interact with Syt-I in the absence of gangliosides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It was recently shown that the interaction of BoNT/B with Syt-I depends on the presence of gangliosides. Therefore, we checked next whether BoNT/G displays the same binding mode. However, BoNT/G·Syt-I complexes already form in the absence of gangliosides and exhibit a similar affinity as compared with conditions with micelle-incorporated gangliosides (Fig. 3, right panel). BoNT/G Binds to the Membrane Proximal Region of Syt-I and Syt-II—Because the mode of binding differs between BoNT/B and BoNT/G with respect to the requirement of gangliosides, it was interesting to investigate whether BoNT/B and -G associate with the same segment of Syt. Dong et al. (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) showed that the membrane proximal region of Syt-II, i.e. residues 40–60, comprises the binding site for BoNT/B. We therefore mapped the binding site for BoNT/G by truncating Syt-I and Syt-II. Results presented in Fig. 4B show that HCG binds to GST·Syt-II-1–61. No binding is detected, however, to GST·Syt-II-1–51, suggesting that BoNT/G shares the interaction site with BoNT/B. The binding site for BoNT/B in Syt-I could not be determined via carboxyl-terminal-truncated Syt-I, because this interaction only occurs when Syt-I and gangliosides are concomitantly present in micellar structures (Fig. 4A) (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we were able to establish that the corresponding membrane proximal segment of Syt-I, i.e. residues 43–53, is crucial for the binding of BoNT/G because HCG is pulled down by GST·Syt-I-1–53 but not by GST·Syt-I-1–43. This interaction occurs as with full-length BoNT/G-wt (Fig. 3) whether gangliosides are present or not. The Isolated Luminal Domain of Syt-I and Syt-II Blocks the Toxicity of BoNT/G at the Mouse Phrenic Nerve—To provide evidence for the physiological relevance of the BoNT/G-Syt interaction, we investigated whether the neurotoxicity of BoNT/G could be blocked by preincubating the neurotoxin with peptides derived from the luminal domain of Syt-I and Syt-II. As an assay system we chose the established mouse phrenic nerve toxicity test (18Habermann E. Dreyer F. Bigalke H. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1980; 311: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In the first set of experiments, we inspected whether it succeeded in blocking the effect of BoNT/B. scBoNT/B was applied in a 2-nm concentration, which results in a 50% reduction of the hemidiaphragm muscle contractile force within 59.2 ± 3.6 min (paralytic half-time). Preincubation of scBoNT/B with a 1000-fold molar excess of GST·Syt-II-1–61 leads to a 61% inhibition of neurotoxicity (paralytic half-time: 76.0 ± 5.7 min), whereas a 10,000-fold molar excess results in a 95.1% inhibition (paralytic half-time: 132.3 ± 13.2 min; Fig. 5). Removal of the GST portion increases the potency of Syt-II-1–61 10-fold because a peptide concentration of 1.95 μm raises the paralytic half-time to 138.5 ± 10.6 min (corresponding to a 95.9% inhibition). In line with results of the binding experiments, GST·Syt-II-1–51, a variant devoid of the complete interaction site, has no influence on neurotoxicity. Secondly, GST·Syt-I-1–53, as well as the corresponding peptide Syt-I-1–53, does not significantly prolong the paralytic half-time of scBoNT/B because preincubation occurred in the absence of micellar gangliosides (Fig. 5). BoNT/G proved to be far less active at the mouse phrenic nerve than BoNT/B and BoNT/A, probably because of a lower affinity to synaptosomal membranes 2A. Rummel and T. Binz, unpublished results. as well as to a lower catalytic activity of its LC versus other synaptobrevin-hydrolyzing CNTs (20Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hayashi T. Szabo E. Yamasaki N. Eklund M. Jahn R. Niemann H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 200: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A final concentration of 105 nm scBoNT/G-wt resulted in a paralytic half-time of 120 min (data not shown). Bath concentrations of up to 1 mm GST·Syt would have been required for inhibition studies. Attempts were undertaken to acquire nicked, i.e. proteolytically activated, BoNT/G because nicked CNTs are generally far more potent. However, activation of recombinant scBoNT/G-wt with trypsin leads to an inadvertent hydrolysis of peptide bonds within the HC (Fig. 2B). To circumvent this problem, we utilized BoNT/G-thro, which is to a great extent specifically activated by E. coli proteases during the purification procedure. BoNT/G-thro proves to be about 80-fold more active than scBoNT/G-wt. A final bath concentration of 20 nm results in a paralytic half-time of 55.8 ± 3.8 min and was consequently used for neutralization studies. In contrast to BoNT/B, both GST·Syt-II-1–61 and GST·Syt-I-1–53 are able to efficiently diminish the neurotoxicity of BoNT/G-thro on preincubation with a 1000-fold molar excess by 66.2% and 75.1% (according to 74.4 ± 6.5 min, 80.7 ± 2.5 min paralytic half-time), respectively. Syt-II-1–61 and Syt-I-1–53 applied at 100-fold molar excess decrease the neurotoxicity by 37.9% (63.3 ± 5.9 min) and 66.4% (74.5 ± 4.9 min), respectively, and thus nearly approximate the efficacy of their 10-fold higher concentrated GST-tagged variants. In addition, preincubation of BoNT/G-thro with an equimolar mixture of GST·Syt-II-1–61 and GST·Syt-I-1–53 (∼10 μm each) inhibits phrenic nerve paralysis to a similar extent as 19.5-μm concentrations of the individual fusion proteins (63.7%; 73.0 ± 2.8 min; Fig. 5). The shortened constructs GST·Syt-II-1–51 and GST·Syt-I-1–43 do not affect the toxicity of BoNT/G-thro, as indicated by paralytic half-times of 59.5 ± 6.4 and 46.0 ± 4.2 min, respectively, that do not significantly differ from the untreated control. The results with the latter truncated Syt variants also demonstrate that inhibition through GST·Syts is specific and does not interfere with any other physiological process in the assay system. As a further control experiment, we assessed whether the toxicity of scBoNT/A is effected by preincubation with GST·Syt, because entry of this neurotoxin has previously been shown to be independent of an interaction with either Syt (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig. 5, even a 19.5-μm final concentration of GST·Syt-II-1–61 has no detectable effect on the toxicity of 0.22 nm scBoNT/A. This finding further validates the specificity of the assay system. Together, these results prove that Syt-I and Syt-II indeed do mediate the entry of BoNT/G into peripheral nerve cells. The HCC Domain of BoNT/B and BoNT/G Mediates the Interaction with Syt—It is known that the HCC domain of the TeNT and BoNT HC-fragments is responsible for ganglioside binding (17Rummel A. Mahrhold S. Bigalke H. Binz T. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 22Sutton J.M. Chow-Worn O. Spaven L. Silman N.J. Hallis B. Shone C.C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). No function could so far be allocated to HCN. To assign the Syt binding site to either of the two domains, we expressed each as His6-tagged proteins in E. coli and conducted pull-down experiments. HCNA and HCCA served as control peptides in this assay. Fig. 6 clearly demonstrates that the HCC, but not the HCN, domain of BoNT/B and -G interacts with GST·Syt-II-1–61. So, in addition to ganglioside binding, the HCC domain of BoNT/B and BoNT/G mediates the interaction with the protein receptor as well. BoNTs, the causative agents of botulism, disrupt the neurotransmission of cholinergic nerves at the neuromuscular junction. More than one decade ago, the underlying molecular basis for the inhibition of neurotransmitter release was deciphered for all BoNTs and TeNT, which turned out to be the proteolysis of one of three intracellular soluble NSF attachment protein receptor proteins by their catalytic domains. On the other hand, receptors that mediate the productive uptake of CNTs into nerve terminals have so far only been unequivocally identified for BoNT/B (12Nishiki T. Kamata Y. Nemoto Y. Omori A. Ito T. Takahashi M. Kozaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10498-10503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the cellular receptor for the second of the eight CNTs, BoNT/G, which like BoNT/B is guided into neurons through its specific interaction with Syt-I or Syt-II. Two lines of evidence support this suggestion. First, by means of GST pull-down experiments we were able to show that BoNT/G interacts directly with the luminal domain of Syt-I and Syt-II. Second, peptides derived from the luminal domain of Syt-I and Syt-II are capable of blocking the entry of BoNT/G into motoneurons that innervate the mouse diaphragm. This only occurs when these peptides contain the membrane anchor-juxtaposed luminal 10 amino acids of Syt. The identified segment of Syt-I and Syt-II becomes transiently exposed on the membrane surface only when synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane at synapses. This is in line with the well documented finding that nerve stimulation generally accelerates the uptake of BoNTs and concomitant poisoning of nerve terminals (23Black J.D. Dolly J.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, TeNT was previously also shown to be taken up via recycling of synaptic vesicles (24Matteoli M. Verderio C. Rossetto O. Iezzi N. Coco S. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13310-13315Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that CNTs in general enter nerve terminals via this route and may associate with segments of resident synaptic vesicle proteins that are exposed to the luminal side. In contrast to what was reported for BoNT/B (15Dong M. Richards D.A. Goodnough M.C. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1293-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the binding of BoNT/G to Syt-I is apparently independent of the presence of gangliosides. The most obvious explanation for this discrepancy is that a low affinity of BoNT/B for Syt-I does not allow detection by GST pull-down experiments. Here, only the simultaneous interaction with Syt-I and a ganglioside molecule ultimately guarantees high affinity binding. In BoNT/G, sequence variation in its Syt binding fold may account for stronger binding to Syt-I. Alternative explanations like the generation of a high affinity binding site for Syt-I because of ganglioside-induced structural changes is unlikely to occur, because significant structural changes were not observed in several crystals of BoNT/B and its complexes with sialyllactose (21Swaminathan S. Eswaramoorthy S. Nature Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) or doxorubicin (25Eswaramoorthy S. Kumaran D. Swaminathan S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1743-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gangliosides incorporated in Triton micelles did not support binding of BoNT/B to a truncated Syt-I variant that lacked the membrane anchor domain, indicating strict requirement of both Syt-I and ganglioside within the context of membranes. Our study illustrates that the HCC domains of BoNT/B and BoNT/G are responsible for the binding to their protein receptor. This interaction is requisite for productive uptake into neurons. Indirect evidence for an employment of HCC in this process has recently been suggested for TeNT as well (5Herreros J. Lalli G. Schiavo G. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, the HCC domains likely function as a closed cell entry module in all CNTs, whereas the function of the HCN domain still awaits elucidation. The novel finding of the present study that BoNT/G, just like BoNT/B, utilizes Syt-I and Syt-II for its entry into nerve terminals is consistent with their degree of sequence conservation. The similarity score for aligning their HC-fragments is 42.4% and is only exceeded by the score of 58.0% for HCE (strain NCTC11219)/HCF (Clostridium baratii) (ClustalW software). Almost all other pairwise alignments result in less than 30% similarity. We have further shown that the HCC domain of BoNT/B and -G mediates the binding to Syt-I and Syt-II. With respect to sequence alignments of HCC, HCCB/HCCG actually reaches by far the highest similarity score (39.5%), whereas those for many other pairs drop down to less than 20%. This agrees with the notion that none of the remaining six CNTs binds to Syt-I or Syt-II and the observation that BoNT/B and -G are incapable of competing binding of BoNT/A and E to synaptosomal membranes.2 These data add further support to the premise that all other CNTs associate with different protein receptors to become endocytosed. Interestingly, TeNT, which is sorted into the retrograde axonal transport route upon endocytosis, was demonstrated to bind simultaneously to two separate carbohydrate structures (16Rummel A. Bade S. Alves J. Bigalke H. Binz T. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Fotinou C. Emsley P. Black I. Ando H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Sinha K.A. Fairweather N.F.

Ng T. Schiavo G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, the use of a separate protein receptor that ensures exit from the lysosomal transport route of BoNTs is plausible explicitly for TeNT. We thank Drs. Thomas C.

https://openalex.org/W2143522379,"The mitochondrial carriers are a family of transport proteins that, with a few exceptions, are found in the inner membranes of mitochondria. They shuttle metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors through this membrane and thereby connect and/or regulate cytoplasm and matrix functions. ATP-Mg is transported in exchange for phosphate, but no protein has ever been associated with this activity. We have isolated three human cDNAs that encode proteins of 458, 468, and 489 amino acids with 66–75% similarity and with the characteristic features of the mitochondrial carrier family in their C-terminal domains and three EF-hand Ca2+-binding motifs in their N-terminal domains. These proteins have been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Their transport properties and their targeting to mitochondria demonstrate that they are isoforms of the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier described in the past in whole mitochondria. The tissue specificity of the three isoforms shows that at least one isoform was present in all of the tissues investigated. Because phosphate recycles via the phosphate carrier in mitochondria, the three isoforms of the ATP-Mg/Pi carrier are most likely responsible for the net uptake or efflux of adenine nucleotides into or from the mitochondria and hence for the variation in the matrix adenine nucleotide content, which has been found to change in many physiopathological situations."

We demonstrate that Mcl-1 is widely expressed in malignant B-cells, and high-level expression of Mcl-1 is required for B-lymphoma cell survival, since transfection of Mcl-1-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides was sufficient to promote apoptosis in Akata6 lymphoma cells. Mcl-1 was efficiently cleaved by caspases at evolutionarily conserved aspartic acid residues in vitro, and during cisplatin-induced apoptosis in B-lymphoma cell lines and spontaneous apoptosis of primary malignant B-cells. Overexpression of the Mcl-1 cleavage product that accumulated during apoptosis was sufficient to kill cells. Therefore, Mcl-1 is an essential survival molecule for B-lymphoma cells and is cleaved by caspases to a death-promoting molecule during apoptosis. In contrast to Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL were relatively resistant to caspase cleavage in vitro and in intact cells. Interfering with Mcl-1 function appears to be an effective means of inducing apoptosis in Mcl-1-positive B-cell lymphoma, and the unique sensitivity of Mcl-1 to caspase-mediated cleavage suggests an attractive strategy for converting it to a proapoptotic molecule."

Here we show the effect of long telomeres on lifespan in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We examined the effect of telomere length on lifespan by overexpressing HRP-1, a telomere-binding protein, which gradually increased telomere length in worms. Worms with longer telomeres lived longer. We confirmed that the extension of lifespan was due to the increased telomere length, and not to the overexpression of HRP-1 per se, by examining the lifespans of nontransgenic progeny of the transgenic worms, who retained the longer telomeres. The lifespan-extending effect of long telomeres was dependent on daf-16. The number of germ stem cells was not affected in worms with long telomeres, indicating that the telomere effect on lifespan is independent of germ stem cell cycling. Worms with long telomeres were more resistant to heat stress. Taken together, our results suggest that signaling may be initiated in postmitotic somatic cells by telomere length to regulate organismal lifespan."

Here we introduce a method to detect selection on the basis of a single genome sequence. We catalogue the relative strength of selection on each gene in the entire genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Plasmodium falciparum. Our analysis confirms that most antigens are under strong selection for amino-acid substitutions, particularly the PE/PPE family2 of putative surface proteins in M. tuberculosis and the EMP1 family3 of cytoadhering surface proteins in P. falciparum. We also identify many uncharacterized proteins that are under strong selection in each pathogen. We provide a genome-wide analysis of natural selection acting on different stages of an organism's life cycle: genes expressed in the ring stage4 of P. falciparum are under stronger positive selection than those expressed in other stages of the parasite's life cycle. Our method of estimating selective pressures requires far fewer data than comparative sequence analysis, and it measures selection across an entire genome; the method can readily be applied to a large range of sequenced organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2067883706,"The Rho family GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 function as molecular switches that transduce intracellular signals regulating multiple cell functions including gene expression, adhesion, migration and invasion. p53 and its regulator p19Arf, on the other hand, are tumor suppressors that are critical in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Previously, we have demonstrated that the Rho proteins contribute to the cell proliferation, gene transcription and migration phenotypes unleashed by p19Arf or p53 deletion in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). To further investigate their functional interaction in the present study, we have examined the involvement of Rho signaling pathways in p53-mediated cell invasion. We found that in primary MEFs (1) p53 or p19Arf deficiency led to a marked increase in the number of focal adhesion plaques and fibronectin production, and RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 contribute to the p53- and p19Arf-mediated focal adhesion regulation, but not fibronectin synthesis; (2) although endogenous Rac1 activity was required for the p19Arf or p53 deficiency-induced migration phenotype, hyperactive Rho GTPases could not further enhance cell migration, rather they suppressed cell–cell adhesion of p53−/− MEFs; (3) expression of the active mutant of RhoA, Rac1 or Cdc42, but not Ras, promoted an invasion phenotype of p53−/−, not p19Arf−/−, cells; (4) although ROCK activation can partially recapitulate Rho-induced invasion phenotype, multiple pathways regulated by RhoA, in addition to ROCK, are required to fully cooperate with p53 deficiency to promote cell invasion; and (5) extracellular proteases produced by the active RhoA-transduced cells are also required for the invasion phenotype of p53−/− cells. Combined with our previous observations, these results strongly suggest that mitogenic activation of Rho family GTPases can cooperate with p53 deficiency to promote primary cell invasion as well as transformation and that multiple signaling components regulated by the Rho proteins are involved in these processes."

Here, we found that 2,3-DCPE suppressed the proliferation of Bcl-XL-overexpressing cancer cells without inducing apoptosis. Subsequently, we found that 2,3-DCPE could induce S-phase arrest and upregulate p21 but not p27 at a time- and dose-dependent but p53-dispensable manner in DLD-1 human colon cancer cells. Activation of ERK was also detected after treatment with 2,3-DCPE. Moreover, p21 induction was dramatically attenuated by ERK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Induction of p21 and S-phase arrest and corresponding activation of ERK were also observed in ATM-defective cells, suggesting that 2,3-DCPE-induced these events were ATM-dispensable. Furthermore, ERK inhibitors dramatically attenuated 2,3-DCPE-induced S-phase arrest. Together, our data indicate that ERK activation correlated with the 2,3-DCPE-mediated induction of p21 expression and S-phase arrest. This finding may have implication for cancer therapy."

Cells were harvested and homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The postnuclear supernatant was collected by centrifugation of the cell homogenates at 1000 × g for 5 min in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Membranous fractions were then pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—First-dimensional Blue Native (BN) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed essentially as described previously (17Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). In brief, microsomal membranes were prepared as described above and were then solubilized with ice-cold BN-lysis buffer containing 1% (w/v) detergent (either digitonin or CHAPSO), 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The lysate (100 μl) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was adjusted with 0.5 volumes of BN-sample buffer (containing 0.75% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0, 30% glycerol, and 1% detergent). The samples were separated on a 6–13% Blue Native polyacrylamide gel poured 1 day before analysis, as described previously (17Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Google Scholar). Marker proteins used for BN-PAGE were thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; β-amylase, 200 kDa; and bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa (Sigma). For the second-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the Blue Native gel was destained in 5% acetic acid/25% methanol. After thorough washing in 25% methanol, individual lanes were excised and equilibrated for 15 min in two-dimensional (2D) sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 1% dithiothreitol, and bromphenol blue). The gel strip was then loaded onto Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris 4–12% precast 2D gel (Invitrogen) for SDS-PAGE. For Western blotting, the resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were: mouse monoclonal anti-nicastrin clone 35 (BD Transduction Laboratories); rabbit polyclonal anti-nicastrin (PAI-758; Affinity Bioreagents); rabbit anti-aph-11 N-terminal antibody O2C2 (8Gu Y.

Glycerol Velocity Gradients—HEK293 cells stably expressing APP-C99 were washed with 4 °C cold PBS, resuspended in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.25 m sucrose plus protease inhibitors, and homogenized, and the postnuclear supernatant was prepared as described previously (16Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar). Microsomal membranes pelleted from the postnuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C and lysised in 1% CHAPSO in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl, plus protease inhibitors. The lysates were re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were used for glycerol gradient centrifugation fractionation experiments as described previously (7Yu G. Chen F.

In brief, 1 ml of total protein extracts was applied to the top of an 11.0-ml 10–40% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% CHAPSO. Gradients were centrifuged for 15 h at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C using a Beckman SW41 rotor and were collected into 1.0-ml fractions from top of the centrifugation tube. Cell-free γ-Secretase Assay—CHAPSO-solubilized membranes that had been resolved by glycerol velocity gradient fractionation were precleared with preimmune serum linked to beads, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an antibody to PS1 N terminus (antibody 14) that had been cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose with dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma). The immunopurified, high molecular weight PS1 complexes were washed once with assay buffer, and resuspended in 0.25% detergent (CHAPSO or digitonin) containing assay buffer, pH 6.4 (10 mm KOAc, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm sodium citrate), containing protease inhibitors, and were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h to generate ϵ-stubs. Control samples were kept on ice. At the end of the assay, the samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 450 mm Tris, 12% glycerol, 0.0025% Coomassie Blue G, and 0.0025% phenol red, pH 8.4) and were used for Western blotting to measure the appearance of ϵ-stubs as described previously (16Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar). There is an apparent stoichiometric discrepancy between the predominant localization of some of the presenilin complex components within the early secretory pathway (e.g. PS1 and aph-1) versus the functional observation that γ-secretase cleavage of Notch and APP occur predominantly at, or near, the cell surface. To explore this, we undertook immunocytochemical studies of endogenous presenilin components in KNS glioma cells, mouse cerebellar granule neurons (not shown), and mouse cerebellar glial cells (Fig. 1). It was immediately apparent that although there is overlap between the distributions of these proteins, the degree of overlap is far from a perfect spatial co-registration (Fig. 1). These results hint either that there may be more than one type of complex formed by various different combinations of these proteins or that the complex components might be added to complexes in a spatially and temporally defined order. The conclusion that there may not be a single “presenilin complex” would be in good agreement with previously published biochemical experiments, which had have shown that aph-1 and immature forms of nicastrin co-fractionate separately from PS1 and pen-2 on glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic fractionations (8Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7374-7380Google Scholar, 9LaVoie M.J. Fraering P.C. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Kimberly W.T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37213-37222Google Scholar). If nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, and the presenilins do indeed form more than a single type of complex, it immediately begs the question as to whether all of these complexes have γ-secretase activity. To begin to address these issues, we undertook detailed 2D gel electrophoresis studies using BN gel electrophoresis in the first dimension, followed by standard SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis in the second dimension. When the initial cell lysates of HEK293 cells expressing APPSwedish were prepared using 1% CHAPSO as the solubilizing detergent, at least two distinct PS1 immunoreactive spots were identified at ∼440 and ≥670 kDa, together with a smear pattern at even higher masses (Fig. 2, left). The ∼440- and ≥670-kDa complexes both contained maturely glycosylated nicastrin, aph-1, pen-2, PS1-NTF, and PS1-CTF. However, only the ≥670-kDa complex contained APP-CTFs. These observations are unlikely to simply represent idiosyncrasies of the gel electrophoresis methodology because a broad distribution of complexes ranging from ∼150 to ≥670 kDa were also seen when these lysates were resolved on glycerol velocity gradients (Fig. 3A, left). Because the resolution of individual complexes is less robust on unidimensional glycerol velocity gradients, and because the glycerol velocity gradients resolve proteins according to relative buoyancy rather than by charge and mass as in gel electrophoretic separations, the predicted mass measurements are not identical between the 2D gel studies and the velocity gradients. Nevertheless, in general agreement with the result of the 2D gels, immature nicastrin and one of two peaks of aph-1 are enriched in lower molecular weight fractions at ∼100–200 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fractions 3–5). On the other hand, PS1, pen-2, and maturely glycosylated nicastrin are enriched in higher molecular weight fractions from 200 to >670 kDa, and there is a secondary peak of aph-1 at ∼440 kDa (Fig. 3A, left, fraction 8).Fig. 3A, glycerol velocity gradient analyses of membrane preparations containing presenilin complexes solubilized in 1% CHAPSO (left) or 1% digitonin (right). These studies confirm the existence of a low molecular mass (∼150 kDa) complex enriched in aph-1 and immature nicastrin (lanes 3 and 4) and one or more higher molecular weight complexes (200 to ≥670 kDa) containing PS1, and varying amounts of mature nicastrin (NCT), aph-1, and pen-2 (lanes 5–11). Like the 2D gel studies, the ≥670-kDa complexes (lanes 8–11) were essentially absent when membranes were solubilized in 1% digitonin. B, cell-free γ-secretase assays were performed on pooled fractions from the CHAPSO glycerol velocity gradients (left3) and from the digitonin glycerol velocity gradients (right). Compared with control fractions incubated at 0 °C (top left), ϵ-stubs were actively generated by CHAPSO-solubilized fractions 5–6, 7–8, 9–10, and 11–12 incubated at 37 °C for 4 h (middle left); the highest specific activity relative to starting amount of PS1 was in fractions 9–10 and 11–12 (lower left). PS1 complexes from digitonin-solubilized fractions failed to co-immunoprecipitate APP-CTFs and consequently failed to generate ϵ-stubs (right). The failure to generate ϵ-stubs by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes could not be reversed by adding additional exogenous APP-CTFs (see Fig. 3D), and addition of digitonin to CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (with docked substrate) also resulted in loss of γ-secretase activity (data not shown), arguing that digitonin alters the conformation and/or componentry of PS1 complex, rendering it non-functional. C, histograms of the specific γ-secretase activity for pooled fractions from the glycerol velocity gradients. γ-Secretase activity was calculated as the quantity of ϵ-stubs produced/quantity of ϵ-stubs produced plus residual APP-CTFs relative to the amount of PS1 in that fraction. Pooled fractions containing proteins with molecular mass less than 600 kDa (fractions 3–6 or 3–8) had less γ-secretase activity than did fractions with proteins of molecular mass of greater than 600 kDa (fractions 9–12). D, addition of exogenous substrate (APP-C99) resulted in robust generation of ϵ-stubs in CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes (CHP) incubated at 37 °C, but failed to induce ϵ-stub production at 4 °C (negative control) in digitonin-solubilized membranes (DIG) at any temperature. This result argues that the absence of ϵ-stub generation by digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (B, right) is caused by the failure of digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes to dock γ-secretase substrates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The ∼150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is unlikely to subserve catalytic activity because it is present in PS1–/– cells, which do not support γ-secretase activity. From these experiments alone, it is not possible to conclude which, if any, of the other higher mass complexes are associated with functional γ-secretase activity. Attempts to measure the activity of specific complexes isolated from the 2D gels were not successful, presumably because of the low abundance of properly folded complexes being recovered. To circumvent this problem, we elected to use three complementary strategies, which might, when taken together, indirectly infer which of these complexes were necessary for functional activity. These three approaches were: 1) direct ascertainment of functional γ-secretase activity from glycerol velocity gradient fractions; 2) analysis of the differential effects of detergents on γ-secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size; and 3) analysis of the differential effects on PS1 mutations on γ-secretase activity, complex composition, and complex size. To estimate the γ-secretase activity of these complexes, we used a cell-free assay (16Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar) to investigate the generation of ϵ-stubs by anti-PS1 immunopurified membranes that were solubilized in 1% CHAPSO and that had then been resolved by size on the glycerol velocity gradients. The highest specific γ-secretase activity relative to the amount of PS1-NTF in each fraction was found in the higher mass fractions (>500 kDa) of the glycerol velocity gradient (specific activity, 34.6 ± 14.7 and 44.3 ± 17.1 in fractions 9–10 and 11–12, respectively, compared with 12.1 ± 9.7 and 23.5 ± 10.63 in fractions 3–4 and 5–6, respectively, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3, B, lower left, and C). Previous in vitro studies have shown that CHAPSO is the optimum detergent for preserving γ-secretase activity in cell-free membrane preparations and that γ-secretase activity is significantly reduced by digitonin and completely abolished by Triton X-100, n-octyl glucoside, and many other detergents (18Li Y.-M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Google Scholar, 19Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Google Scholar). When the glycerol velocity and 2D gel electrophoretic experiments were repeated using digitonin, there was a significant (≥100-fold) reduction in the abundance of the high molecular weight presenilin complexes on both the 2D gel electrophoreses (Fig. 2, right) and on the glycerol velocity fractionation experiments (Fig. 3A, right). Furthermore, these fractions contain very little co-immunoprecipitating APP-CTFs and failed to generate significant quantities of ϵ-stubs in the cell-free γ-secretase assay (Fig. 3B, right). To confirm that the absence of γ-secretase activity in digitonin-solubilized fractions was caused by failure of docking and cleavage of APP-CTFs by the digitonin-solubilized complexes (as opposed to artifacts such as simple degradation of APP-CTFs during the assay), we performed two additional experiments. First, we immunopurified CHAPSO-solubilized PS1 complexes, and split the product into two aliquots. One aliquot was then submitted directly for γ-secretase assay, whereas digitonin was added to the other aliquot to a final concentration of 0.25%, and then submitted for γ-secretase assay. No ϵ-stubs were generated by the aliquot containing digitonin (data not shown). In the second experiment, we simply added additional purified APP-C99 to CHAPSO-solubilized and to digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes (Fig. 3D). Again, despite the abundant presence of substrate, the digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes failed to generate ϵ-stubs (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these experiments suggest that digitonin-solubilized PS1 complexes have undergone either a conformational shift and/or have lost a substrated adaptor protein. When the presenilin complexes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 or in 1% n-octyl glucoside (neither of which support γ-secretase activity), the very high molecular weight presenilin complex species were essentially abolished and only monomeric species were found (data not shown). Functional γ-secretase activity is also modulated by selected mutations in the presenilin proteins. In particular, mutation of either or both of the two aspartyl residues within membrane-embedded hydrophobic domains (PS1 D257A and PS1 D385A) have been associated with loss of proteolytic activity (20Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.S. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar, 21Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.L.

We therefore investigated the structure and relative abundance of presenilin complexes isolated from cells overexpressing either wild-type PS1 or the PS1 D385A loss-of-function mutant. We have shown previously that the PS1 D385A mutation causes a reduction in the abundance of higher MW species on glycerol velocity gradient fractionation (23Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D-M, Milman P. Fraser P. Haass C. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Google Scholar). We have also shown that this reduction is not caused by the simple failure of endoproteolytic cleavage of PS1 (23Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D-M, Milman P. Fraser P. Haass C. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Google Scholar). Thus, high molecular weight complexes comparable in size with those of wild-type PS1-NTF/CTFs were observed in cells expressing the holoprotein of the PS1 ΔExon 9 deletion mutant (which causes increased γ42-secretase activity but impaired PS1 endoproteolysis) (23Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T. Arawaka S. Supala A. Song Y.-Q. Rogaeva E. Holmes E. Zhang D-M, Milman P. Fraser P. Haass C. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27348-27353Google Scholar). In agreement with these prior observations, in the current 2D gel analyses, the PS1 D385A mutation was again associated with an altered distribution of complexes and components (Fig. 4). Thus, the ≥670-kDa complex was absent in digitonin-solubilized lysates of PS1 D385A-expressing cells, which displayed only the ∼440-kDa complex, and monomeric bands for nicastrin (∼110 kDa) and the PS1 D385A holoprotein (∼65 kDa) were observed (Fig 4A, right). Similar but less profound changes in relative abundance of the ≥670- and ∼440-kDa complexes were also apparent after CHAPSO solubilization (Fig. 4, B–F). Thus, in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 4, B, left, and C–F), there was greater abundance of the ≥670-kDa complex relative to the ∼440-kDa complexes (670 kDa/470 kDa ratio, 1.11 ± 0.15, n = 4 replications). However, in PS1 D385A overexpressing cells (Fig. 4, B, right, and C–F), there was a significant loss of the ≥670-kDa complex and a corresponding overabundance of the ∼440-kDa complex (670 kDa/440 kDa ratio, 0.57 ± 0.03; p < 0.002). The immunocytochemical data, the data from glycerol velocity gradient and 2D gel electrophoretic separations, and the functional data arising from the differential effects of detergents and PS1 mutations cumulatively argue that there are several, authentic, independent complexes each with different molecular masses. Although each of the techniques differs in the observed sizes of the complexes, their results are congruent, and it therefore seems very unlikely that these apparently distinct complexes are artifacts. A more probable explanation is that the multiplicity of complexes relates to the maturation of the presenilin complex and to its functional regulation. Based upon the fact that aph-1 is relatively stable in the absence of PS1 and binds to immature nicastrin, we have previously suggested that aph-1 is an initial scaffolding molecule upon which the functional complex is built (8Gu Y. Chen F. Sanjo N. Kawarai T. Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Li W. Ruan X. Luthra A. Mount H.T. Tandon A. Fraser P.E. St George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7374-7380Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that in PS1–/– cells, the ∼150 kDa aph-1-nicastrin complex is stable and contains immature nicastrin, whereas the ∼440- and ≥670-kDa complexes are destabilized. We now propose that the ∼440-kDa complex, which contains additional components (aph-1, PS1, nicastrin, and pen-2) but does not dock the APP-CTF substrate efficiently, is a relatively abundant but non-functional intermediary complex. In support of this, the ∼440-kDa complex is stably present under conditions that are not associated with functional γ-secretase activity (i.e. in the presence of digitonin or the PS1 D385A missense loss of function mutation). The prevalence (albeit at low levels of abundance) of the high molecular weight ≥670-kDa complex under conditions associated with functional γ-secretase activity suggests that these complexes are the species that contain full enzymatic activity. This is directly supported by the fact that the highest specific activity for γ-secretase activity is obtained in the glycerol velocity fractions containing complexes of >500 kDa. There are two potential explanations for our results. The first and most straightforward explanation is that these complexes reflect the evolution of the presenilin complexes as they are assembled. The lower mass (∼150 and ∼440 kDa) complexes might then represent initial and intermediary complexes, whereas the low abundance, high mass complexes (≥670 kDa) could represent functional complexes that contain either additional components or contain the four known components in a higher order stoichiometry (e.g. 2:2:2:2). Direct experiments analyzing the composition of these complexes will be required to resolve this possibility. There are, however, two caveats to this hypothesis. First, small, but measurable amounts of the ≥670-kDa complexes are still present in CHAPSO lysates of PS1 D385A cells (although these complexes are considerably reduced in abundance relative to the ∼440-kDa complexes). This does not completely negate our hypothesis that the ≥670-kDa complexes are the functional conform because a substantial proportion of the PS1 D385A molecules are clearly in an aberrant conformational ∼440-kDa state in CHAPSO and nearly all of the PS1 D385A molecules are in the ∼400-kDa complex in digitonin. As a result, it is probable that the PS1 D385A molecules in the ≥670-kDa complexes in CHAPSO do not have an entirely normal conform. The second caveat concerning our postulated hierarchy of complexes arises from the observation that PS1 D385A-expressing cells do not assemble a robust nicastrin-aph-1 ∼150-kDa complex. It could be argued that the ∼150 kDa nicastrin:aph-1 complex is not a precursor complex as we have postulated, but represents a downstream catabolic product of the ∼440- or ≥670-kDa complexes. The stable presence of the ∼150-kDa complex in PS1–/– cells makes this hypothesis unlikely. An alternate explanation for the disappearance of the ∼150-kDa complex in PS1 D385A cells, but not in PS1–/– cells, is that the ∼150-kDa complex could have a dual role. This complex could be involved in presenting new nicastrin molecules to the ∼ 440-kDa complexes, and involved in recovering and re-presenting used nicastrin molecules back to the ∼440-kDa complex. It is conceivable that in the presence of the PS1 D385A mutant, all available aph-1 might become locked-up in the PS1 D385A mutant ∼440-kDa complex, which fails to further mature, thereby causing disappearance of the ∼150 kDa nicastrin-aph-1 complex. A second observation of note in our results is the fact that the C-terminal fragments of APP arising from α- and β-secretase cleavage of the APP holoprotein (which are the substrates for presenilin-dependent γ-secretase cleavage) are not uniformly present in all of the presenilin complexes (see Figs. 3 and 4). In fact, the APP C-terminal stubs are most abundant in complexes associated with functional γ-secretase activity. The increase in apparent molecular mass between the non-functional complexes and the functional complexes cannot be accounted for by the simple addition of one molecule of C-terminal APP stubs per complex (although we cannot exclude the possibility that multiple APP stubs are docked onto functional complexes). However, the differential presence of APP-CTFs raises the intriguing and more plausible possibility that detergents and mutants associated with loss of γ-secretase activity have either: 1) altered the conformation and/or complex stoichiometry in a way that precludes efficient docking of substrates or 2) perturbed the binding of adapter molecules that might be required to allow substrate docking. In keeping with this hypothesis, recent cross-competition assays with different classes of γ-secretase inhibitors has supported the notion that the substrate binding and catalytic sites of γ-secretase may be physically separate and that correct conformational shifts are required to bring bound-substrate into the catalytic site (24Tian G. Ghanekar S.V. Aharony D. Shenvi A.B. Jacobs R.T. Liu X. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28968-28975Google Scholar). In conclusion, our experiments suggest that the maturation and functional deployment of the presenilin proteins is more complex than has previously been thought. Our data raise the possibility that additional components may exist in the high molecular mass functional complexes. Our results also require a more detailed assessment as to whether all of the substrates that undergo presenilin dependent proteolysis are dependent on the same set of presenilin complexes or whether there are specialized complexes subserving cleavage of specific proteins. For instance, it is conceivable that the complexes may differ in componentry according to their subcellular distribution (e.g. lipid-rich raft domains, plasma membrane, endosomal-lysosomal pathway, or autophagic vacuoles (25Hayashi H. Mizuno T. Michikawa M. Haass C. Yanagisawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 81-90Google Scholar, 26Lee S.-J. Liyanage U. Bickel P. Xia W. Lansbury P.T. Kosik K. Nat.

If this were the case, such site-specific composition of the complex might confer either substrate specificity or preferred proteolytic cleavage sites within transmembrane domains and might therefore be potentially exploited therapeutically."

Gap junctions, a multiprotein complex made of proteins called connexins, are involved in intercellular communication and are deregulated in many cancers. Connexin43 (Cx43) is the only connexin for which a pseudogene has been reported so far. The Cx43 pseudogene (ΨCx43) has all of the features of an expressed gene. We identified the presence of a ΨCx43 mRNA transcript in several cancer cell lines and in none of the normal mammary epithelial cells studied. Using an in vitro translation assay, we found that the ΨCx43 coding plasmid could be translated into a 43 kDa protein. This was further confirmed by expressing a ΨCx43-green fluorescence protein fusion protein in breast cancer MCF-7 cells. We then examined the functional significance of the ΨCx43. In both MTT growth and colony formation assays, significant growth inhibition was observed, a feature common to cells overexpressing the Cx43 gene. However, using a scrape-loading assay, we could not detect any effect on gap junctional intercellular communication. Based on our findings, ΨCx43 joins and enlarges the thus far restricted group of functionally transcribed and translated pseudogenes."

In PAE-KDR cells, an endothelial-derived cell line expressing VEGFR-2, VEGF-A165, stimulates the enzymatic activity of Dgk-α: activation is inhibited by R59949, an isoform-specific Dgk inhibitor, and is dependent on Src tyrosine kinase, with which Dgk-α forms a complex. Conversely in HUVEC, VEGF-A165-induced activation of Dgk is only partially sensitive to R59949, suggesting that also other isoforms may be activated, albeit still dependent on Src tyrosine kinase. Specific inhibition of Dgk-α, obtained in both cells by R59949 and in PAE-KDR by expression of Dgk-α dominant-negative mutant, impairs VEGF-A165-dependent chemotaxis, proliferation and in vitro angiogenesis. In addition, in HUVEC, specific downregulation of Dgk-α by siRNA impairs in vitro angiogenesis on matrigel, further suggesting the requirement for Dgk-α in angiogenic signaling in HUVEC. Thus, we propose that activation of Dgk-α generates a signal essential for both proliferative and migratory response to VEGF-A165, suggesting that it may constitute a novel pharmacological target for angiogenesis control."
https://openalex.org/W2063618962,"Acquired resistance towards apoptosis is the hallmark of most if not all types of cancer. We have previously identified and characterized ARTS, a broadly expressed protein localized to mitochondria. ARTS was initially shown to mediate TGF-β induced apoptosis. Recently, we have found that high levels of ARTS induce apoptosis without additional pro-apoptotic stimuli. Further, ARTS promotes apoptosis in response to a wide variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli. Here, we report that the expression of ARTS is lost in all lymphoblasts of more than 70% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The loss of ARTS is specific, as the related non-apoptotic protein H5, bearing 83% identity to ARTS, is unaffected. During remission, ARTS expression is detected again in almost all patients. Two leukemic cell lines, ALL-1 and HL-60 lacking ARTS, were resistant to apoptotic induction by ara-C. Transfection of ARTS into these cells restored their ability to undergo apoptosis in response to this chemotherapeutic agent. We found that methylation process contributes to the loss of ARTS expression. We conclude that the loss of ARTS may provide a selective advantage for cells to escape apoptosis thereby contributing to their transformation to malignant lymphoblasts. We therefore propose that ARTS can function as a tumor suppressor protein in childhood ALL."

https://openalex.org/W2041036964,"The present study addresses the effect of targeting type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) with antisense strategies in in vivo growth of breast cancer cells. Our research was carried out on C4HD tumors from an experimental model of hormonal carcinogenesis in which the synthetic progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) induced mammary adenocarcinomas in Balb/c mice. We employed two different experimental strategies. With the first one we demonstrated that direct intratumor injection of phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (AS[S]ODNs) to IGF-IR mRNA resulted in a significant inhibition of C4HD tumor growth. In the second experimental strategy, we assessed the effect of intravenous (i.v.) injection of AS [S]ODN on C4HD tumor growth. This systemic treatment also resulted in significant reduction in tumor growth. The antitumor effect of IGF-IR AS[S]ODNs in both experimental protocols was due to a specific antisense mechanism, since growth inhibition was dose-dependent and no abrogation of tumor proliferation was observed in mice treated with phosphorothioate sense ODNs (S[S]ODNs). In addition, IGF-IR expression was inhibited in tumors from mice receiving AS[S]ODNs, as compared to tumors from control groups. We then investigated signal transduction pathways modulated in vivo by AS[S]ODNs treatment. Tumors from AS[S]ODN-treated mice of both intratumoral and intravenous protocols showed a significant decrease in the degree of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) tyrosine phosphorylation. Activation of two of the main IGF-IR signaling pathways, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt and p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) was abolished in tumors growing in AS[S]ODN-treated animals. Moreover, ErbB-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by in vivo administration of AS[S]ODNs. On the other hand, we found no regulation of either progesterone receptor expression or activity by in vivo AS[S]ODNs administration. Our results for the first time demonstrated that breast cancer growth can be inhibited by direct in vivo administration of IGF-IR AS[S]ODNs."

https://openalex.org/W1976273475,"We identified IFIX as a new member of the hematopoietic interferon (IFN)-inducible nuclear protein with the 200-amino-acid repeat (HIN-200) family. Six different alternatively spliced forms of mRNA are transcribed from the IFIX gene, which are predicted to encode six different isoforms of IFIX proteins (IFIXalpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2, gamma1, and gamma2). The IFIX proteins are primarily localized in the nucleus. They share a common N-terminal region that contains a predicted pyrin domain and a putative nuclear localization signal. Unlike IFIXalpha and IFIXbeta, IFIXgamma isoforms do not have the 200-amino-acid signature motif. Interestingly, the expression of IFIX was reduced in most human breast tumors and breast cancer cell lines. Expression of IFIXalpha1, the longest isoform of IFIX, in human breast cancer cell lines reduced their anchorage-dependent and -independent growth in vitro and tumorigenicity in nude mice. Moreover, a liposome-mediated IFIXalpha1 gene transfer suppressed the growth of already-formed tumors in a breast cancer xenograft model. IFIXalpha1 appears to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells in a pRB- and p53-independent manner by increasing the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(CIP1), which leads to the reduction of the kinase activity of both Cdk2 and p34(Cdc2). Together, our results show that IFIXalpha1 possesses a tumor-suppressor activity and suggest IFIXalpha1 may be used as a therapeutic agent in cancer treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2119118751,"In the present study, we investigated the relation between p21 expression and the sensitivity of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) cells to apoptotic stimuli. Despite similar cisplatin-induced wild-type p53 accumulation, the TGCT cell lines Tera and Scha expressed low p21 protein and mRNA levels in comparison to A2780 ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition of the proteasome complex with MG-132 increased p21 protein levels in TGCT cells but much more in A2780 cells, whereas cisplatin had no additional effect on p21 protein levels. Inhibition of caspase-3 activity in TGCT cells with the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk had no effect on p21 levels and also not upon cisplatin treatment. A similar induction of p53 irradiation, in contrast to cisplatin, substantially increased both p21 mRNA and protein expression in Tera cells. Cisplatin-treated Tera cells expressing low p21 protein levels were Fas-sensitive, while irradiation-induced p21, which was mainly localized in the cytosol, rendered irradiated Tera cells resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis. Sensitivity of irradiated Tera cells to Fas-induced apoptosis was restored by short interfering RNA-specific suppression of p21 expression. These results strongly indicate that the low p21 protein levels are caused by reduced p21 gene transcription and sensitize cisplatin-treated TGCT cells to the Fas death pathway."

The generation of β-amyloid peptides, the main constituents of senile plaques in brain of Alzheimer's disease patients, is initiated by β-secretase cleavage of APP (1Golde T.E. Estus S. Younkin L.H.

Proteolytic cleavage of APP within the β-amyloid sequence by α-secretase generates a secreted water-soluble 90–100-kDa protein and precludes the generation of β-amyloid peptides (4Haass C. Koo E.H.

In the corresponding studies it was shown that treatment of neuronal cells with PEs (i) enhances the secretion of APP into the culture medium, (ii) increases the formation of non-amyloidogenic C-terminal APP-stubs (named P3-CT or C83), and (iii) reduces the generation of β-amyloid peptides. Competition between APP processing pathways occurs under conditions of robust activation of the α-secretase pathway, most likely because α- and β-secretase pathways utilize the same cellular pool of APP (10Skovronsky D.M. Moore D.B. Milla M.E. Doms R.W. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2568-2575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, PKCs are not the only DAG/PE receptors present in neurons. Proteins of the Munc13 family are DAG/PE receptors with ligand affinities as high as those of PKCs (11Betz A. Ashrey U. Rickmann M. Augustin I. Neher E. Südhof T.C. Rettig J. Brose N. Neuron. 1998; 21: 123-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Therefore, DAG/PE binding site-specific drugs can not differentiate between effects mediated by PKCs or Munc13 proteins. In mammals, there are three homologous Munc13 genes, Munc13-1, Munc13-2, and Munc13-3, whose expression is largely brain-specific (12Brose N. Hofmann K. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25273-25280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Munc13-1 is expressed throughout the brain, whereas the expression of Munc13-2 and Munc13-3 is restricted to neocortical/hippocampal and cerebellar neurons, respectively (13Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Brose N. Nature. 1999; 400: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 14Augustin I. Korte S. Rickmann M. Kretzschmar H.A. Südhof T.C. Herms J.W. Brose N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 10-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether APP processing is regulated by Munc13-1, the dominant Munc13 isoform in brain. For that purpose, we used brains from Munc13-1 knockout mice and from Munc13-1(H567K) knock-in mice that express a Munc13-1 variant deficient in DAG/PE binding instead of the wild-type protein. Because the homozygous knock-out and the dysfunctional knock-in mice deteriorate within three to 5 h after birth, our analysis of APP metabolism relied on brains of newborn mice and on organotypic brain slice cultures established from brains of newborn mice. We also used human BE (2)-C neuroblastoma cells transfected with wild-type and mutant Munc13-1(H567K) constructs and monitored their effect on basal and PMA-stimulated secretory APP processing. Mutant Mice—Munc13-1 deletion mutant mice and Munc13-1(H5676K) knock-in mutant mice were published previously (13Augustin I. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Brose N.

Western Blot Analysis—Neonatal mice were sacrificed by decapitation, the brains were removed rapidly from the skull and 10% homogenates (w/v) were prepared in Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m, pH 7.4). Aliquotes of the homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C and 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatants containing secretory/soluble proteins were stored at –80 °C. APP in tissue homogenates and supernatants as well as in conditioned medium of cultured cells/organotypic brain slice cultures was detected by Western blot analysis as described in ref. 16Rossner S. Beck M.T. Stahl T. Mendla K. Schliebs R. Bigl V. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 3191-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar. Briefly, APP blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes was detected using a primary mouse antibody that recognizes an N-terminal APP epitope (22C11, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany, 1:500). In control experiments antibodies against the C-terminal fragment of APP (AB 5352, Chemicon, Deisenhofen, Germany; 1:1,000) were used to demonstrate that the supernatants did not contain full-length APP. Additionally, supernatants from tissue homogenates were run alongside with the membrane fraction and detected with the antibody 22C11 to show that full-length and secretory APP migrate at a different position in the gel system. To normalize uneven protein loading, actin detected with a polyclonal antiserum (Sigma, A 2066; 1:1,000) served as internal control. Blots were digitized (ScanJet 6100C, Hewlett Packard) and images were evaluated by densitometric image analysis using the software package TINA 2.0 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). The sum of gray values over each individual band obtained by densitometry was normalized for actin immunoreactivity, and data were expressed as percentage change over corresponding control animal value and given as mean ± S.E. Linearity between protein content and optical readings values was proved by running standard curves ranging from 10 to 50 μg of protein per lane. α- and β-Secretase Activity Assays—The α- and β-secretase enzymatic activities in brains of mice with different genotype were measured using a commerical assay (R & D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The assay is based on the cleavage of fluorochromated peptide substrates containing the α- and β-secretase cleavage site, respectively. The enzymatic activity was monitored at 510 nm and expressed as percent of secretase activity in brains of wild-type mouse brain. BE (2)-C Cell Culture and Transfection—The human neuroblastoma cell line BE (2)-C was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium/Ham's F-12 medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. The growth medium was changed three times a week and the cells were split 1:3 weekly. For transfection, cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 3 × 10 (4Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) cells per well. The serum-containing medium was replaced by Optimem, and cells were incubated with a mixture of 1 μg of the corresponding Munc13-1 or Munc13-1(H567K) plasmid DNA and 2 μl of the DMRIE-C transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) per ml transfection medium for 3 h. Thereafter, the transfection medium was replaced by culture medium as above, cells were grown overnight, and then singularized and transfected cells were selected based on G418 resistance. Organotypic Brain Slice Cultures—Organotypic brain slice cultures of newborn mouse brain were established as described recently (17Brückner G. Grosche J. Exp. Brain Res. 2001; 137: 83-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were prepared and mounted in 1.5% agarose in distilled water, and 400-μm-thick sections were cut in the coronal plane using a vibratome. Brain sections were collected and maintained in culture plate inserts (Minicell CM, 30-mm diameter; Millipore, Bedford, MA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium conatining 25% horse serum 0.2% d-glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.3 mm HEPES. The medium was changed every other day, and brain slices were cultured for 7 days before stimulation experiments with PMA were performed. PMA Stimulation—BE (2)-C cells as well as organotypic brain slice cultures were stimulated with PMA (100 nm) or vehicle (Me2SO) for 4 h. The PKC-specific inhibitor Gö6983 was added 5 min before PMA treatment and was present in the incubation medium during the entire stimulation period. After stimulation, the medium was collected, concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation through amicon-30 filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and used for Western blot analysis of secretory APP molecules as described above. In the first set of experiments, total APP protein and secretory APP molecules from brains of newborn mice of all genotypes were quantified by Western blot analysis. There was no difference in total APP content between brains of wild-type mice, Munc13-1 knock-out mice, and Munc13-1(H567K) mice (Fig. 1). However, in brains of Munc13-1 knock-out mice there was a 20% reduction in secretory APP molecules measured in supernatants of tissue homogenates (Fig. 1). These APP molecules migrated at a lower molecular weight than full-length APP and did not display immunoreactivity for the intracellular C-terminal domain (not shown). The reduced basal secretory processing of APP in brains of Munc13-1 knock-out mice was not due to a reduced expression of the α-secretase ADAM-10 as judged from Western blot analysis (not shown). However, the α-secretase enzymatic activity was reduced by 30% as compared with its activity in brains of wild-type mice, both in the absence and presence of 100 nm PMA (Fig. 2). Additionally, in brains from Munc13-1(H567K) mice, we observed a 30% reduction in PMA-stimulated, but not basal, α-secretase activity (Fig. 2). The enzymatic activity of β-secretase was similar in all genotypes, both in the presence and absence of PMA. This indicates a specific impairment of the α-secretase pathway of secretory APP processing. We next examined the consequences of Munc13-1 knock-out and the Munc13-1(H567K) knock-in mutation on PMA-stimulated APP processing in organotypic brain slice cultures. Cultures were established from newborn mice of all genotypes and maintained for 7 days. Brain slices were then stimulated for 4 h with 100 nm PMA or vehicle, and the conditioned medium was collected and proteins larger than 30 kDa were enriched 10-fold by centrifugation through Amicon-30 filters. There was no cytotoxicity during the brief stimulation with 100 nm PMA as jugded from lactate dehydrogenase release (not shown). The basal APP secretion from brain slices of all genotypes was very similar (Fig. 3a). However, PMA stimulation of brain slices from wild-type mice increased APP secretion by 160% as compared with basal APP secretion (Fig. 3a). This is a well known phenomenon described earlier and attributed to PKC activation (6Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6003-6006Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 8Caporaso G.L. Gandy S.E. Buxbaum J.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3055-3059Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The PMA-induced increase in APP secretion was much less pronounced in brain slices from Munc13-1 knock-out mice (increase of 70%), indicating that the effects of PMA rely to a considerable extent on the presence of Munc13-1 (Fig. 3a). A similar impairment in PMA-stimulated APP secretion was observed in brain slices from Munc13-1(H567K) knock-in mice (Fig. 3a). This observation demonstrates that not the presence of the Munc13-1 protein, but its DAG/PE receptor function is required for DAG/PE-dependent stimulation of secretory APP processing. Our data on the reduced secretory APP processing under conditions of lacking or DAG/PE-insensitive Munc13-1 protein expression prompted us to perform another set of experiments where we transfected human BE (2)-C neuroblastoma cells with wild-type Munc13-1 or DAG/PE-insensitive Munc13-1(H567K) constructs. We followed secretory APP processing after stimulation with PMA for 4 h in the absence or presence of Gö6983, a bisindolylmaleimide derivative that specifically interacts with the ATP binding site of PKCs but does not interfere with Munc13-1 function (15Rhee J.S. Betz A. Pyott S. Reim K. Varoqueaux F. Augustin I. Hesse D. Südhof T.C. Takahashi M. Rosenmund C. Brose N. Cell. 2002; 108: 121-133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In mock-transfected control BE (2)-C cells, PMA-stimulated APP secretion by 150% in the absence and by 70% in the presence of the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 (3 μm; Fig. 3b). Overexpression of wild-type Munc13-1 in BE (2)-C cells robustly increased the PMA-stimulated APP secretion as compared with control BE (2)-C cells, providing additional evidence for a role of Munc13-1 in the PMA-stimulated secretory APP processing. This was supported by the observation that the counteracting effect of the PKC inhibitor Gö6983 on PMA-induced APP secretion is much less pronounced in the Munc13-1 transfected BE (2)-C cells as compared with control BE (2)-C cells (Fig. 3b). Upon overexpression of DAG/PE-insensitive Munc13-1(H567K) protein, the PMA-stimulated APP secretion was significantly reduced as compared with control BE (2)-C cells, both in the absence and presence of Gö6983 (Fig. 3b), most likely because overexpression of the DAG/PE-insensitive Munc13-1 protein compromises the function of the endogenous Munc13-1 protein. The results presented here are in conflict with the view of an exclusive role for PKC in the PE-stimulated secretory APP processing. Published conclusions about the role of PKC in the modulation of APP processing are largely based on indirect pharmacological evidence using substances which are not PKC-specific but also target other proteins expressed by neurons and/or peripheral cells (18Brose N. Rosenmund C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4399-4411Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Genetic approaches to characterize the role of PKC in cellular functions are hampered by the presence of multiple PKC isoforms with functional redundancy. Therefore, we used a genetic approach to interfere with the function of the Munc13-1 protein, a neuronal DAG/PE receptor, to reveal the contributions of PKC and Munc13-1 in PE-stimulated APP processing. This strategy revealed that Munc13-1 acts independently of and in parallel with PKC in the PE-stimulated APP processing pathway. Our findings are consistent with a scenario according to which upon PE stimulation, APP is redistributed from the trans-Golgi network to secretory vesicles (19Xu H. Greengard P. Gandy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23243-23245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). If these vesicles lack functional Munc13-1 proteins, as is the case in knock-out cells, or if they express DAG/PE-insensitive Munc13-1, as in Munc13-1(H567K) knock-in cells, they will be less efficiently primed under basal and DAG/PE-stimulated conditions, respectively. As a consequence, neurotransmitter release as well as trafficking and insertion of APP into the plasma membrane after vesicular fusion are impaired. It is well established that APP present in the plasma membrane is the major source of the APP processed in the α-secretase pathway (5Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Thus, diminished APP transport to the cellular membrane, e.g. due to interference with Munc13-1 function, reduces APP molecules available for α-secretase processing by extracellular matrix metalloproteinases such as ADAM-10 (20Lammich S. Kojro E. Postina R. Gilbert S. Pfeiffer R. Jasionowski M. Haass C. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3922-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). As a result, secretory APP processing was found to be reduced in Munc13-1 mutants without reduction in the protein levels of its processing enzyme ADAM-10. However, α-secretase enzymatic activity in brain tissue homogenates, as measured by cleavage of a synthetic peptide, was reduced in Munc13-1 knock-out and Munc13-1(H567K) brains (see Fig. 2). This unexpected finding may be explained by the accumulation of full-length APP in secretory vesicles as described above and the subsequent disruption of the cellular membrane during the freeze/thaw cycle preceeding the α-secretase activity assay, which makes both the endogenous APP and the synthetic substrate available to and competing for α-secretase. Alternatively, α-secretase activity harboring enzymes may be co-transported along with APP in secretory vesicles and, as in the case of APP, not released into the extracellular space by neurons lacking functional Munc13-1 protein. This novel regulatory mechanism of secretory APP processing appears to be specific for neuronal cells and does not occur in human embryonic kidney cells transfected with APP and Munc13-1 constructs. 2M.

Our data demonstrate that Munc13-1-mediated vesicle priming is not only relevant for neurotransmitter release but is also functional in protein secretion/exocytosis as already shown recently for insulin exocytosis from pancreatic islet beta cells (21Sheu L.

Our observations also identify Munc13-1 as an alternative target to modulate APP processing pathways in Alzheimer's disease. The development of activators of Munc13-1 function, such as PE derivatives specific for the Munc13-1 C1 domain or small molecules mimicking RIM1 (see Ref. 22Betz A. Thakur P. Junge H.J. Ashery U.

Independently of the clinical importance of our findings, this is the first and most likely not the last identification of a cellular function for Munc13-1 that was previously attributed exclusively to PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1976944384,"Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8/KSHV) is etiologically associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and other tumors. Constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway has been associated with a variety of tumors, including AIDS-related KS. The oncoprotein Raf is situated at a pivotal position in regulating the MAPK pathway. Hence, we analysed the effect of oncoprotein Raf on HHV-8 infectious entry into target cells. Here we report Raf expression to significantly enhance HHV-8 infection of target cells. These findings implicate a role for Raf not only in the infectious entry of HHV-8 but also in modulating KS pathogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1978488951,"It is known that excess amounts of Ski, or any member of its proto-oncoprotein family, causes disruption of the transforming growth factor beta signal transduction pathway, thus causing oncogenic transformation of cells. Previous studies indicate that Ski is a relatively unstable protein whose expression levels can be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the stability of Ski is regulated. We show that the steady-state levels of Ski protein are controlled post-translationally by cell cycle-dependent proteolysis, wherein Ski is degraded during the interphase of the cell cycle but is relatively stable during mitosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34 mediates cell cycle-dependent Ski degradation both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of dominant-negative Cdc34 stabilizes Ski and enhances its ability to antagonize TGF-β signaling. Our data suggest that regulated proteolysis of Ski is one of the key mechanisms that control the threshold levels of this proto-oncoprotein, and thus prevents epithelial cells from becoming TGF-β resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2082343657,"It has been demonstrated that proline-rich nuclear receptor coregulatory protein (PNRC) is a nuclear receptor coactivator that interacts with nuclear receptors through an SH3-binding motif located in its C-terminus. In the present report, a physical interaction between PNRC and Grb2 (an adapter protein involved in growth factor/Ras-mediated pathways) has been demonstrated using the GST pull-down assay, the yeast two-hybrid assay, as well as by coimmunoprecipitation. Cotransfection and fluorescence imaging have also confirmed the colocalization of PNRC and Grb2 in mammalian cells. Transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that, by interacting with each other, Grb2 decreases the coactivator activity of PNRC for nuclear receptors, and that PNRC suppresses Grb2-mediated Ras/MAP-kinase activation. Furthermore, it was discovered that HeLa cells overexpressing PNRC grew more slowly when compared to matched controls. Additionally, using a RT–PCR analysis of mRNA on six pairs of cancer/noncancer tissues, PNRC expression was found to be significantly lower in breast cancer tissue than in noncancer tissue. Based on these findings, we believe that PNRC and Grb2, by interacting with each other, can suppress nuclear receptor-mediated regulation and growth factor-mediated regulation in human breast tissue. This is a newly identified crosstalk mechanism for modulating these two important types of regulatory pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1968566033,"Three of the Rad family proteins, Rad9, Rad1, and Hus1, can interact with each other and form a heterotrimeric complex that is thought to play a role in the sensing step of the DNA integrity checkpoint pathways, but the nature of the Rad9–Rad1–Hus1 complex assembly remains enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the human hRad1 protein plays a significant role as molecular chaperone in the process of the hRad9–hRad1–hHus1 heterotrimeric complex formation. In contrast to hRad1, hHus1 is an unstable protein that is actively degraded via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. We show that treating cells with proteasome-specific inhibitors stabilizes hHus1 expression. Moreover, hRad1 can associate with hHus1 in the absence of hRad9 and protect hHus1 from ubiquitination and degradation in the cytoplasm. Importantly, genotoxic stress induces hRad1 expression and stabilizes the hHus1 protein. Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role of hRad1 as a potential intrinsic chaperone in the stabilization of hHus1 for the hRad9–hRad1–hHus1 checkpoint complex formation."
