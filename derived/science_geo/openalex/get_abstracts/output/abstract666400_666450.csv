https://openalex.org/W3119633778,"The COVID-19 pandemic does not fit into prevailing Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) models, or diagnostic criteria, yet emerging research shows traumatic stress symptoms as a result of this ongoing global stressor. Current pathogenic event models focus on past, and largely direct, trauma exposure to certain kinds of life-threatening events. Yet, traumatic stress reactions to future, indirect trauma exposure, and non-Criterion A events exist, suggesting COVID-19 is also a traumatic stressor which could lead to PTSD symptomology. To examine this idea, we asked a sample of online participants ( N = 1,040), in five western countries, to indicate the COVID-19 events they had been directly exposed to, events they anticipated would happen in the future, and other forms of indirect exposure such as through media coverage. We then asked participants to complete the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5, adapted to measure pre/peri/post-traumatic reactions in relation to COVID-19. We also measured general emotional reactions (e.g., angry, anxious, helpless), well-being, psychosocial functioning, and depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms. We found participants had PTSD-like symptoms for events that had not happened and when participants had been directly (e.g., contact with virus) or indirectly exposed to COVID-19 (e.g., via media). Moreover, 13.2% of our sample were likely PTSD-positive, despite types of COVID-19 “exposure” (e.g., lockdown) not fitting DSM-5 criteria. The emotional impact of “worst” experienced/anticipated events best predicted PTSD-like symptoms. Taken together, our findings support emerging research that COVID-19 can be understood as a traumatic stressor event capable of eliciting PTSD-like responses and exacerbating other related mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, psychosocial functioning, etc.). Our findings add to existing literature supporting a pathogenic event memory model of traumatic stress."

https://openalex.org/W3120974422,"Totipotency is the ability of a single cell to give rise to all of the differentiated cell types that build the conceptus, yet how to capture this property in vitro remains incompletely understood. Defining totipotency relies on a variety of assays of variable stringency. Here, we describe criteria to define totipotency. We explain how distinct criteria of increasing stringency can be used to judge totipotency by evaluating candidate totipotent cell types in mice, including early blastomeres and expanded or extended pluripotent stem cells. Our data challenge the notion that expanded or extended pluripotent states harbour increased totipotent potential relative to conventional embryonic stem cells under in vitro and in vivo conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3118718784,"Dysregulated iron metabolism is a hallmark of many cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). However, its role in tumor progression remains unclear. Herein, we identified coatomer protein complex subunit zeta 1 (COPZ1) as a therapeutic target candidate which significantly dysregulated iron metabolism in GBM cells. Overexpression of COPZ1 was associated with increasing tumor grade and poor prognosis in glioma patients based on analysis of expression data from the publicly available database The Cancer Genome Atlas (P < 0.001). Protein levels of COPZ1 were significantly increased in GBM compared to non-neoplastic brain tissue samples in immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. SiRNA knockdown of COPZ1 suppressed proliferation of U87MG, U251 and P3#GBM in vitro. Stable expression of a COPZ1 shRNA construct in U87MG inhibited tumor growth in vivo by ~60% relative to controls at day 21 after implantation (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the survival data demonstrated that the overall survival of tumor bearing animals increased from 20.8 days (control) to 27.8 days (knockdown, P < 0.05). COPZ1 knockdown also led to the increase in nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), resulting in the degradation of ferritin, and a subsequent increase in the intracellular levels of ferrous iron and ultimately ferroptosis. These data demonstrate that COPZ1 is a critical mediator in iron metabolism. The COPZ1/NCOA4/FTH1 axis is therefore a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of human GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3118836546,"Nutrient availability is central for T-cell functions and immune responses. Here we report that CD8+ T-cell activation and anti-tumour responses are strongly potentiated by the non-essential amino acid Asn. Increased Asn levels enhance CD8+ T-cell activation and effector functions against tumour cells in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, restriction of dietary Asn, ASNase administration or inhibition of the Asn transporter SLC1A5 impairs the activity and responses of CD8+ T cells. Mechanistically, Asn does not directly alter cellular metabolic fluxes; it instead binds the SRC-family protein tyrosine kinase LCK and orchestrates LCK phosphorylation at Tyr 394 and 505, thereby leading to enhanced LCK activity and T-cell-receptor signalling. Thus, our findings reveal a critical and metabolism-independent role for Asn in the direct modulation of the adaptive immune response by controlling T-cell activation and efficacy, and further uncover that LCK is a natural Asn sensor signalling Asn sufficiency to T-cell functions."
https://openalex.org/W3120156080,"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) has devastating economic impact. During the last decade, LSD had spread to climatically new and previously disease-free countries, which also includes its recent emergence in the Indian subcontinent (2019). This study deals with the LSD outbreak(s) from cattle in Ranchi (India). Virus was isolated from the scabs (skin lesions) in the primary goat kidney cells. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide sequencing of LSD virus (LSDV) ORF011, ORF012 and ORF036 suggested that the isolated virus (LSDV/ Bos taurus -tc/India/2019/Ranchi) is closely related to Kenyan LSDV strains. Further, we adapted the isolated virus in Vero cells. Infection of the isolated LSDV to Vero cells did not produce cytopathic effect (CPE) until the 4 th blind passage, but upon adaptation, it produced high viral titres in the cultured cells. The kinetics of viral DNA synthesis and one-step growth curve analysis suggested that Vero cell-adapted LSDV initiates synthesizing its genome at ~24 hours post-infection (hpi) with a peak level at ~96 hpi whereas evidence of progeny virus particles was observed at 36–48 hours (h) with a peak titre at ~120 h. To the best of our knowledge, this study describes the first successful isolation of LSDV in India, besides providing insights into the life cycle Vero cell-adapted LSDV."
https://openalex.org/W3120264852,"Bone metastasis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity in breast cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better select high-risk patients in order to adapt patient's treatment and prevent bone recurrence. Here, we found that integrin alpha5 (ITGA5) was highly expressed in bone metastases, compared to lung, liver, or brain metastases. High ITGA5 expression in primary tumors correlated with the presence of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow aspirates from early stage breast cancer patients (n = 268; p = 0.039). ITGA5 was also predictive of poor bone metastasis-free survival in two separate clinical data sets (n = 855, HR = 1.36, p = 0.018 and n = 427, HR = 1.62, p = 0.024). This prognostic value remained significant in multivariate analysis (p = 0.028). Experimentally, ITGA5 silencing impaired tumor cell adhesion to fibronectin, migration, and survival. ITGA5 silencing also reduced tumor cell colonization of the bone marrow and formation of osteolytic lesions in vivo. Conversely, ITGA5 overexpression promoted bone metastasis. Pharmacological inhibition of ITGA5 with humanized monoclonal antibody M200 (volociximab) recapitulated inhibitory effects of ITGA5 silencing on tumor cell functions in vitro and tumor cell colonization of the bone marrow in vivo. M200 also markedly reduced tumor outgrowth in experimental models of bone metastasis or tumorigenesis, and blunted cancer-associated bone destruction. ITGA5 was not only expressed by tumor cells but also osteoclasts. In this respect, M200 decreased human osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro. Overall, this study identifies ITGA5 as a mediator of breast-to-bone metastasis and raises the possibility that volociximab/M200 could be repurposed for the treatment of ITGA5-positive breast cancer patients with bone metastases."
https://openalex.org/W3118679284,"The rise and fall of ancient societies have been attributed to rapid climate change events. One of the most discussed of these is the 4.2kya event, a period of increased aridity and cooling posited as the cause of societal changes across the globe, including the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia. Studies seeking to correlate social and climatic changes around the 4.2kya event have tended to focus either on highly localized analyses of specific sites or surveys or more synthetic overviews at pan-continental scales, and temporally on the event and its aftermath. Here we take an empirical approach at a large spatial scale to investigate trends in population and settlement organization across the entirety of Northern Fertile Crescent (Northern Mesopotamia and the Northern Levant) from 6,000 to 3,000 cal BP. We use Summed Probability Distributions of radiocarbon dates and data from eighteen archaeological surveys as proxies for population, and a dataset of all settlements over ten hectares in size as a proxy for the degree of urbanization. The goal is to examine the spatial and temporal impact of the 4.2kya event and to contextualize it within longer term patterns of settlement. We find that negative trends are visible during the event horizon in all three proxies. However, these occur against a long-term trend of increased population and urbanization supported through unsustainable overshoot and the exploitation of a drier zone with increased risk of crop failure. We argue that the 4.2kya event occurred during a period of unprecedented urban and rural growth which may have been unsustainable even without an exogenous climate forcing."
https://openalex.org/W3118934890,"Arginine methylation is an important posttranslational modification catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). However, the role of PRMTs in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is not well understood. Here we report that non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO) is overexpressed in CRC tissue and is a potential marker for poor prognosis in CRC patients. NONO silencing resulted in decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells, whereas overexpression had the opposite effect. In a xenograft model, tumors derived from NONO-deficient CRC cells were smaller than those derived from wild-type (WT) cells, and PRMT1 inhibition blocked CRC xenograft progression. A mass spectrometry analysis indicated that NONO is a substrate of PRMT1. R251 of NONO was asymmetrically dimethylated by PRMT1 in vitro and in vivo. Compared to NONO WT cells, NONO R251K mutant-expressing CRC cells showed reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion, and PRMT1 knockdown or pharmacological inhibition abrogated the malignant phenotype associated with NONO asymmetric dimethylation in both KRAS WT and mutant CRC cells. Compared to adjacent normal tissue, PRMT1 was highly expressed in the CRC zone in clinical specimens, which was correlated with poor overall survival in patients with locally advanced CRC. These results demonstrate that PRMT1-mediated methylation of NONO at R251 promotes CRC growth and metastasis, and suggest that PRMT1 inhibition may be an effective therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment regardless of KRAS mutation status."
https://openalex.org/W3118411958,"CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with acquired immunity against viruses and plasmids, but how these systems are regulated to prevent autoimmunity is poorly understood. Here, we show that in the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system, a long-form transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracr-L) folds into a natural single guide that directs Cas9 to transcriptionally repress its own promoter (Pcas). Further, we demonstrate that Pcas serves as a critical regulatory node. De-repression causes a dramatic 3,000-fold increase in immunization rates against viruses; however, heightened immunity comes at the cost of increased autoimmune toxicity. Using bioinformatic analyses, we provide evidence that tracrRNA-mediated autoregulation is widespread in type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we unveil a new paradigm for the intrinsic regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems by natural single guides, which may facilitate the frequent horizontal transfer of these systems into new hosts that have not yet evolved their own regulatory strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3119957914,"Pancreatic cancer is lethal in over 90% of cases since it is resistant to current therapeutic strategies. The key role of STAT3 in promoting pancreatic cancer progression has been proven, but effective interventions that suppress STAT3 activities are limited. The development of novel anticancer agents that directly target STAT3 may have potential clinical benefits for pancreatic cancer treatment. Here, we report a new small-molecule inhibitor (N4) with potent antitumor bioactivity, which inhibits multiple oncogenic processes in pancreatic cancer. N4 blocked STAT3 and phospho-tyrosine (pTyr) peptide interactions in fluorescence polarization (FP) assay, specifically abolished phosphor-STAT3 (Tyr705), and suppressed expression of STAT3 downstream genes. The mechanism involved the direct binding of N4 to the STAT3 SH2 domain, thereby, the STAT3 dimerization, STAT3-EGFR, and STAT3-NF-κB cross-talk were efficiently inhibited. In animal models of pancreatic cancer, N4 was well tolerated, suppressed tumor growth and metastasis, and significantly prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. Our results offer a preclinical proof of concept for N4 as a candidate therapeutic compound for pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3048028928,"To respond to the urgent need for COVID-19 testing, countries perform nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in centralized laboratories. Real-time RT—PCR (Reverse transcription—Polymerase Chain Reaction), used to amplify and detect the viral RNA., is considered, as the current gold standard for diagnostics. It is an efficient process, but the complex engineering required for automated RNA extraction and temperature cycling makes it incompatible for use in point of care settings [1]. In the present work, by harnessing progress made in the past two decades in isothermal amplification and paper microfluidics, we created a portable test, in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA is extracted, amplified isothermally by RT—LAMP (Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification), and detected using intercalating dyes or fluorescent probes. Depending on the viral load in the tested samples, the detection takes between twenty minutes and one hour. Using a set of 16 pools of naso-pharyngal swab eluates, we estimated a limit of detection comparable to real-time RT-PCR (i.e. 1 genome copies per microliter of clinical sample) and no cross‐reaction with eight major respiratory viruses currently circulating in Europe. We designed and fabricated an easy-to-use portable device called “COVIDISC” to carry out the test at the point of care. The low cost of the materials along with the absence of complex equipment will expedite the widespread dissemination of this device. What is proposed here is a new efficient tool to help managing the pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W3118579062,"Procollagen lysyl hydroxylase 1 (PLOD1) is highly expressed in malignant tumors such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that PLOD1 is associated with the progression of GBM, particularly the most malignant mesenchymal subtype (MES). Moreover, in the TCGA and CGGA datasets, the mean survival time of patients with high PLOD1 expression was significantly shorter than that of patients with low expression. The clinical samples confirmed this result. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of PLOD1 on the development of mesenchymal GBM in vitro and in vivo and its possible mechanisms. Molecular experiments were conducted on the patient-derived glioma stem cells and found that PLOD1 expressed higher in tumor tissues and cancer cell lines of patients with GBM, especially in the MES. PLOD1 also enhanced tumor viability, proliferation, migration, and promoted MES transition while inhibited apoptosis. Tumor xenograft results also indicated that PLOD1 overexpression significantly promotes malignant behavior of tumors. Mechanistically, bioinformatics analysis further revealed that PLOD1 expression was closely associated with the NF-κB signaling pathway. Besides, we also found that hypoxic environments also enhanced the tumor-promoting effects of PLOD1. In conclusion, overexpression of PLOD1 may be an important factor in the enhanced invasiveness and MES transition of GBM. Thus, PLOD1 is a potential treatment target for mesenchymal GBM or even all GBM."
https://openalex.org/W3118474607,"The advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC) has a poor prognosis because of chemoresistance. 6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), a glycolytic enzyme, is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and plays important roles in promoting tumor cell growth. Here, we showed that high expression of PFKFB3 in EC cell lines is associated with chemoresistance. Pharmacological inhibition of PFKFB3 with PFK158 and or genetic downregulation of PFKFB3 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and enhanced the sensitivity of EC cells to carboplatin (CBPt) and cisplatin (Cis). Moreover, PFKFB3 inhibition resulted in reduced glucose uptake, ATP production, and lactate release. Notably, we found that PFK158 with CBPt or Cis exerted strong synergistic antitumor activity in chemoresistant EC cell lines, HEC-1B and ARK-2 cells. We also found that the combination of PFK158 and CBPt/Cis induced apoptosis- and autophagy-mediated cell death through inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Mechanistically, we found that PFK158 downregulated the CBPt/Cis-induced upregulation of RAD51 expression and enhanced CBPt/Cis-induced DNA damage as demonstrated by an increase in γ-H2AX levels in HEC-1B and ARK-2 cells, potentially revealing a means to enhance PFK158-induced chemosensitivity. More importantly, PFK158 treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with CBPt, led to a marked reduction in tumor growth in two chemoresistant EC mouse xenograft models. These data suggest that PFKFB3 inhibition alone or in combination with standard chemotherapy may be used as a novel therapeutic strategy for improved therapeutic efficacy and outcomes of advanced and recurrent EC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3118768505,"Coral reefs are deteriorating worldwide prompting reef managers and stakeholders to increasingly explore new management tools. Following back-to-back bleaching in 2016/2017, multi-taxa coral nurseries were established in 2018 for the first time on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to aid reef maintenance and restoration at a “high-value” location–Opal Reef–frequented by the tourism industry. Various coral species (n = 11) were propagated within shallow water (ca. 4-7m) platforms installed across two sites characterised by differing environmental exposure–one adjacent to a deep-water channel (Blue Lagoon) and one that was relatively sheltered (RayBan). Growth rates of coral fragments placed onto nurseries were highly variable across taxa but generally higher at Blue Lagoon (2.1–10.8 cm 2 month -1 over 12 months) compared to RayBan (0.6–6.6 cm 2 month -1 over 9 months). Growth at Blue Lagoon was largely independent of season, except for Acropora tenuis and Acropora hyacinthus , where growth rates were 15–20% higher for December 2018-July 2019 (“warm season”) compared to August-December 2018 (“cool season”). Survivorship across all 2,536 nursery fragments was ca. 80–100%, with some species exhibiting higher survivorship at Blue Lagoon ( Acropora loripes , Porites cylindrica ) and others at RayBan ( A . hyacinthus , Montipora hispida ). Parallel measurements of growth and survivorship were used to determine relative return-on-effort (RRE) scores as an integrated metric of “success” accounting for life history trade-offs, complementing the mutually exclusive assessment of growth or survivorship. RRE scores within sites (across species) were largely driven by growth, whereas RRE scores between sites were largely driven by survivorship. The initial nursery phase of coral propagation therefore appears useful to supplement coral material naturally available for stewardship of frequently visited Great Barrier Reef tourism (high-value) sites, but further assessment is needed to evaluate how well the growth rates and survival for nursery grown corals translate once material is outplanted."
https://openalex.org/W3120354350,"Abstract Previous studies studying mis-splicing mutations were based on exome data and thus our current knowledge is largely limited to exons and the canonical splice sites. To comprehensively characterise intronic mis-splicing mutations, we analysed 1134 pan-cancer whole genomes and transcriptomes together with 3022 normal control samples. The ratio-based splicing analysis resulted in 678 somatic intronic mutations, with 46% residing in deep introns. Among the 309 deep intronic single nucleotide variants, 245 altered core splicing codes, with 38% activating cryptic splice sites, 12% activating cryptic polypyrimidine tracts, and 36% and 12% disrupting authentic polypyrimidine tracts and branchpoints, respectively. All the intronic cryptic splice sites were created at pre-existing GT/AG dinucleotides or by GC-to-GT conversion. Notably, 85 deep intronic mutations indicated gain of splicing enhancers or loss of splicing silencers. We found that 64 tumour suppressors were affected by intronic mutations and blood cancers showed higher proportion of deep intronic mutations. In particular, a telomere maintenance gene, POT1 , was recurrently mis-spliced by deep intronic mutations in blood cancers. We validated a pseudoexon activation involving a splicing silencer in POT1 by CRISPR/Cas9. Our results shed light on previously unappreciated mechanisms by which noncoding mutations acting on splicing codes in deep introns contribute to tumourigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3119237440,"Loss of the fragile X protein FMRP is a leading cause of intellectual disability and autism1,2, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We report that FMRP deficiency results in hyperactivated nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD)3,4 in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and fragile X syndrome (FXS) fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We examined the underlying mechanism and found that the key NMD factor UPF1 binds directly to FMRP, promoting FMRP binding to NMD targets. Our data indicate that FMRP acts as an NMD repressor. In the absence of FMRP, NMD targets are relieved from FMRP-mediated translational repression so that their half-lives are decreased and, for those NMD targets encoding NMD factors, increased translation produces abnormally high factor levels despite their hyperactivated NMD. Transcriptome-wide alterations caused by NMD hyperactivation have a role in the FXS phenotype. Consistent with this, small-molecule-mediated inhibition of hyperactivated NMD, which typifies iPSCs derived from patients with FXS, restores a number of neurodifferentiation markers, including those not deriving from NMD targets. Our mechanistic studies reveal that many molecular abnormalities in FMRP-deficient cells are attributable-either directly or indirectly-to misregulated NMD."
https://openalex.org/W3119386006,"In an outbreak, effective detection of the aetiological agent(s) involved using molecular techniques is key to efficient diagnosis, early prevention and management of the spread. However, sequencing is necessary for mutation monitoring and tracking of clusters of transmission, development of diagnostics and for vaccines and drug development. Many sequencing methods are fast evolving to reduce test turn-around-time and to increase through-put compared to Sanger sequencing method; however, Sanger sequencing remains the gold standard for clinical research sequencing with its 99.99% accuracy This study sought to generate sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 using Sanger sequencing method and to characterize them for possible site(s) of mutations. About 30 pairs of primers were designed, synthesized, and optimized using endpoint PCR to generate amplicons for the full length of the virus. Cycle sequencing using BigDye Terminator v.3.1 and capillary gel electrophoresis on ABI 3130xl genetic analyser were performed according to the manufacturers’ instructions. The sequence data generated were assembled and analysed for variations using DNASTAR Lasergene 17 SeqMan Ultra. Total length of 29,760bp of SARS-CoV-2 was assembled from the sample analysed and deposited in GenBank with accession number: MT576584. Blast result of the sequence assembly shows a 99.97% identity with the reference sequence. Variations were noticed at positions: nt201, nt2997, nt14368, nt16535, nt20334, and nt28841-28843, which caused amino acid alterations at the S (aa614) and N (aa203-204) regions. The mutations observed at S and N-gene in this study may be indicative of a gradual changes in the genetic coding of the virus hence, the need for active surveillance of the viral genome."
https://openalex.org/W3120128043,"Current evidence indicates that resistance to the tyrosine kinase-type cell surface receptor (HER2)-targeted therapies is frequently associated with HER3 and active signaling via HER2-HER3 dimers, particularly in the context of breast cancer. Thus, understanding the response to HER2-HER3 signaling and the regulation of the dimer is essential to decipher therapy relapse mechanisms. Here, we investigate a bidirectional relationship between HER2-HER3 signaling and a type-1 transmembrane sorting receptor, sortilin-related receptor (SorLA; SORL1). We demonstrate that heregulin-mediated signaling supports SorLA transcription downstream of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. In addition, we demonstrate that SorLA interacts directly with HER3, forming a trimeric complex with HER2 and HER3 to attenuate lysosomal degradation of the dimer in a Ras-related protein Rab4-dependent manner. In line with a role for SorLA in supporting the stability of the HER2 and HER3 receptors, loss of SorLA compromised heregulin-induced cell proliferation and sensitized metastatic anti-HER2 therapy-resistant breast cancer cells to neratinib in cancer spheroids in vitro and in vivo in a zebrafish brain xenograft model."
https://openalex.org/W3118661479,"Pregnancy complications associated with prenatal hypoxia lead to increased placental oxidative stress. Previous studies suggest that prenatal hypoxia can reduce mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mitochondrial fusion, which could lead to placental dysfunction and impaired fetal development. We developed a placenta-targeted treatment strategy using a mitochondrial antioxidant, MitoQ, encapsulated into nanoparticles (nMitoQ) to reduce placental oxidative stress and (indirectly) improve fetal outcomes. We hypothesized that, in a rat model of prenatal hypoxia, nMitoQ improves placental mitochondrial function and promotes mitochondrial fusion in both male and female placentae. Pregnant rats were treated with saline or nMitoQ on gestational day (GD) 15 and exposed to normoxia (21% O2 ) or hypoxia (11% O2 ) from GD15-21. On GD21, male and female placental labyrinth zones were collected for mitochondrial respirometry assessments, mitochondrial content, and markers of mitochondrial biogenesis, fusion and fission. Prenatal hypoxia reduced complex IV activity and fusion in male placentae, while nMitoQ improved complex IV activity in hypoxic male placentae. In female placentae, prenatal hypoxia decreased respiration through the S-pathway (complex II) and increased N-pathway (complex I) respiration, while nMitoQ increased fusion in hypoxic female placentae. No changes in mitochondrial content, biogenesis or fission were found. In conclusion, nMitoQ improved placental mitochondrial function in male and female placentae from fetuses exposed to prenatal hypoxia, which may contribute to improved placental function. However, the mechanisms (ie, changes in mitochondrial respiratory capacity and mitochondrial fusion) were distinct between the sexes. Treatment strategies targeted against placental oxidative stress could improve placental mitochondrial function in complicated pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W3120066537,"Political disagreements in social media can result in removing (i.e., “unfriending”) a person from one’s online network. Given that such actions could lead to the (ideological) homogenization of networks, it is pivotal to understand the psychological processes intertwined in unfriending decisions. This requires not only addressing different types of disagreements but also analyzing them in the relational context they occur. This article proposes that political disagreements leading to drastic measures such as unfriending are attributable to more deeply rooted moral dissents. Based on moral foundations theory and relationship regulation research, this work presents empirical evidence from two experiments. In both studies, subjects rated political statements (that violated different moral foundations) with regard to perceived reprehensibility and the likelihood of unfriending the source. Study 1 ( N = 721) revealed that moral judgments of a political statement are moderately related to the unfriending decision. Study 2 ( N = 822) replicated this finding but indicated that unfriending is less likely when the source of the morally reprehensible statement is relationally close to the unfriender and provides emotional support. This research extends unfriending literature by pointing to morality as a new dimension of analysis and offers initial evidence uncovering the psychological trade-off behind the decision of terminating digital ties. Drawing on this, our findings inform research on the homogenization of online networks by indicating that selective avoidance (in the form of politically motivated unfriending) is conditional upon the relational context and the interpersonal benefits individuals receive therein."
https://openalex.org/W3118743286,"Objectives To propose a novel robust radiogenomics approach to the identification of epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using Betti numbers (BNs). Materials and methods Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) images of 194 multi-racial NSCLC patients (79 EGFR mutants and 115 wildtypes) were collected from three different countries using 5 manufacturers’ scanners with a variety of scanning parameters. Ninety-nine cases obtained from the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) in Malaysia were used for training and validation procedures. Forty-one cases collected from the Kyushu University Hospital (KUH) in Japan and fifty-four cases obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) in America were used for a test procedure. Radiomic features were obtained from BN maps, which represent topologically invariant heterogeneous characteristics of lung cancer on CT images, by applying histogram- and texture-based feature computations. A BN-based signature was determined using support vector machine (SVM) models with the best combination of features that maximized a robustness index (RI) which defined a higher total area under receiver operating characteristics curves (AUCs) and lower difference of AUCs between the training and the validation. The SVM model was built using the signature and optimized in a five-fold cross validation. The BN-based model was compared to conventional original image (OI)- and wavelet-decomposition (WD)-based models with respect to the RI between the validation and the test. Results The BN-based model showed a higher RI of 1.51 compared with the models based on the OI (RI: 1.33) and the WD (RI: 1.29). Conclusion The proposed model showed higher robustness than the conventional models in the identification of EGFR mutations among NSCLC patients. The results suggested the robustness of the BN-based approach against variations in image scanner/scanning parameters."
https://openalex.org/W3119800675,"Insecticide resistance is a worldwide threat for vector control around the world, and Aedes aegypti , the main vector of several arboviruses, is a particular concern. To better understand the mechanisms of resistance, four isofemale strains originally from French Guiana were isolated and analysed using combined approaches. The activity of detoxification enzymes involved in insecticide resistance was assayed, and mutations located at positions 1016 and 1534 of the sodium voltage-gated channel gene, which have been associated with pyrethroid resistance in Aedes aegypti populations in Latin America, were monitored. Resistance to other insecticide families (organophosphates and carbamates) was evaluated. A large-scale proteomic analysis was performed to identify proteins involved in insecticide resistance. Our results revealed a metabolic resistance and resistance associated with a mutation of the sodium voltage-gated channel gene at position 1016. Metabolic resistance was mediated through an increase of esterase activity in most strains but also through the shifts in the abundance of several cytochrome P450 (CYP450s). Overall, resistance to deltamethrin was linked in the isofemale strains to resistance to other class of insecticides, suggesting that cross- and multiple resistance occur through selection of mechanisms of metabolic resistance. These results give some insights into resistance to deltamethrin and into multiple resistance phenomena in populations of Ae . aegypti ."
https://openalex.org/W3119637011,"Tumors of the nervous system including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are the most frequent and aggressive form of brain tumors; however, little is known about the impact of the circadian timing system on the formation, growth, and treatment of these tumors. We investigated day/night differences in tumor growth after injection of A530 glioma cells isolated from malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNSTs) of NPcis (Trp53+/- ; Nf1+/- ) mice. Synchronized A530 cell cultures expressing typical glial markers were injected at the beginning of the day or night into the sciatic nerve zone of C57BL/6 mice subject to a 12:12 hours light/dark (LD) cycle or after being released to constant darkness (DD). Tumors generated in animals injected early at night in the LD cycle or in DD showed higher growth rates than in animals injected diurnally. No differences were found when animals were injected at the same time with cultures synchronized 12 hours apart. Similar experiments performed with B16 melanoma cells showed higher tumor growth rates in animals injected at the beginning of the night compared to those injected in the daytime. A higher tumor growth rate than that in controls was observed when mice were injected with knocked-down clock gene Bmal1 cells. Finally, when we compared day/night administration of different doses of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) in tumor-bearing animals, we found that low-dose chemotherapy displayed higher efficacy when administered at night. Results suggest the existence of a precise temporal control of tumor growth and of drug efficacy in which the host state and susceptibility are critical."
https://openalex.org/W3118655670,"The noncoding RNAs play important role in growth and development of mammalian skeletal muscle. Recent work has shown that circRNAs are abundant in skeletal muscle tissue, with significant changes in their expression patterns during muscle development and aging. We identified a novel circRNA called circARID1A that is highly expressed in mice skeletal muscle compare to its linear transcript. Experiments shown that circARID1A significantly inhibited the process of C2C12 cell proliferation and promoted its differentiation. Interactions between circRNA and miRNA were screened by miRNA gene chip sequencing. The results indicated that circARID1A can sponge miR-6368, which was further verified by miRNA sensor and other experiments. Besides, miR-6368 is a commonly expressed miRNA that regulates the expression of several target genes including Tlr4. A mouse model of skeletal muscle injury was successfully established to explore the role of circARID1A in skeletal muscle development and regeneration in vivo. Moreover, we found the overexpression of circARID1A significantly promoted the regeneration of skeletal muscle. The results of our study suggest that circARID1A may regulate skeletal muscle cell development and regeneration by sponging miR-6368."
https://openalex.org/W3120723537,"Laminar shear stress generated by blood flow stimulates endothelial cells and activates signal transduction, which plays an important role in vascular homeostasis. Several lines of evidence indicate that membrane and intracellular lipids are involved in the signal transduction of biomechanical stresses. In this study, we performed global profiling of cellular lipids from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) exposed to laminar shear stress. A total of 761 species of lipids were successfully annotated, with 198 of these species significantly changed in response to shear stress for 24 hours. Ether-linked lipids containing an alkyl moiety with a medium chain length (C11–C14) were uniquely upregulated, and the administration of their biosynthetic precursor 1-O-dodecyl-rac-glycerol attenuated phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression. Given the pro-inflammatory and atherogenic roles of VCAM-1, our findings suggest that the induction of a specific group of lipids (ie, ether-linked lipids with medium length alkyl side chain) may confer atheroprotective and anti-inflammatory roles to vascular endothelial cells under flow conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3120292504,"Gilthead sea bream is an important target for both recreational and commercial fishing in Europe, where it is also one of the most important cultured fish. Its distribution ranges from the Mediterranean to the African and European coasts of the North-East Atlantic. Until now, the population genetic structure of this species in the wild has largely been studied using microsatellite DNA markers, with minimal genetic differentiation being detected. In this geographically widespread study, 958 wild gilthead sea bream from 23 locations within the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean were genotyped at 1159 genome-wide SNP markers by RAD sequencing. Outlier analyses identified 18 loci potentially under selection. Neutral marker analyses identified weak subdivision into three genetic clusters: Atlantic, West, and East Mediterranean. The latter group could be further subdivided into an Ionian/Adriatic and an Aegean group using the outlier markers alone. Seascape analysis suggested that this differentiation was mainly due to difference in salinity, this being also supported by preliminary genomic functional analysis. These results are of fundamental importance for the development of proper management of this species in the wild and are a first step toward the study of the potential genetic impact of the sea bream aquaculture industry."
https://openalex.org/W3119092427,"Obesity is associated with significant comorbidities and financial costs. While behavioral interventions produce clinically meaningful weight loss, weight loss maintenance is challenging. The objective was to improve understanding of the neural and psychological mechanisms modified by mindfulness that may predict clinical outcomes. Individuals who intentionally recently lost weight were randomized to Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) or a control healthy living course. Anthropometric and psychological factors were measured at baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed at baseline and 8 weeks to examine FC changes between regions of interest selected a priori , and independent components identified by independent component analysis. The association of pre-post FC changes with 6-month weight and psychometric outcomes was then analyzed. Significant group x time interaction was found for FC between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, such that FC increased in the MBSR group and decreased in controls. Non-significant changes in weight were observed at 6 months, where the mindfulness group maintained their weight while the controls showed a weight increase of 3.4% in BMI. Change in FC at 8-weeks between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and several ROIs was associated with change in depression symptoms but not weight at 6 months. This pilot study provides preliminary evidence of neural mechanisms that may be involved in MBSR’s impact on weight loss maintenance that may be useful for designing future clinical trials and mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W3119357532,Extra-embryonic mesoderm (ExM)-composed of the earliest cells that traverse the primitive streak-gives rise to the endothelium as well as haematopoietic progenitors in the developing yolk sac. How a specific subset of ExM becomes committed to a haematopoietic fate remains unclear. Here we demonstrate using an embryonic stem cell model that transient expression of the T-box transcription factor Eomesodermin (Eomes) governs haemogenic competency of ExM. Eomes regulates the accessibility of enhancers that the transcription factor stem cell leukaemia (SCL) normally utilizes to specify primitive erythrocytes and is essential for the normal development of Runx1+ haemogenic endothelium. Single-cell RNA sequencing suggests that Eomes loss of function profoundly blocks the formation of blood progenitors but not specification of Flk-1+ haematoendothelial progenitors. Our findings place Eomes at the top of the transcriptional hierarchy regulating early blood formation and suggest that haemogenic competence is endowed earlier during embryonic development than was previously appreciated.
https://openalex.org/W3119505580,"Steroid regulated cancer cells use nuclear receptors and associated regulatory proteins to orchestrate transcriptional networks to drive disease progression. In primary breast cancer, the coactivator AIB1 promotes estrogen receptor (ER) transcriptional activity to enhance cell proliferation. The function of the coactivator in ER+ metastasis however is not established. Here we describe AIB1 as a survival factor, regulator of pro-metastatic transcriptional pathways and a promising actionable target. Genomic alterations and functional expression of AIB1 associated with reduced disease-free survival in patients and enhanced metastatic capacity in novel CDX and PDX ex-vivo models of ER+ metastatic disease. Comparative analysis of the AIB1 interactome with complementary RNAseq characterized AIB1 as a transcriptional repressor. Specifically, we report that AIB1 interacts with MTA2 to form a repressive complex, inhibiting CDH1 (encoding E-cadherin) to promote EMT and drive progression. We further report that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of AIB1 demonstrates significant anti-proliferative activity in patient-derived models establishing AIB1 as a viable strategy to target endocrine resistant metastasis. This work defines a novel role for AIB1 in the regulation of EMT through transcriptional repression in advanced cancer cells with a considerable implication for prognosis and therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3119905891,"Background A high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its components in patients with psychotic disorders may increase the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, relatively little work in this field has emerged from low-resourced contexts. This study investigated the prevalence, correlates, and treatment patterns of metabolic disorders in patients with psychotic disorders in Western Kenya. Methods 300 patients with psychosis and 300 controls were recruited at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Kenya. Data on demographic characteristics, weight, height, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose, lipid profile, and treatments were collected. Categorical and continuous data were compared between the patient and control groups using Pearson’s chi-squared tests and t-tests, respectively. Variables found to be significantly different between these groups were included in logistic regression models to determine potential predictors of metabolic syndrome. Results Compared to controls, patients with psychosis were found to have a higher mean random blood glucose [5.23 vs 4.79, p = 0.003], higher body mass index [5.23 vs 4.79, p = 0.001], higher triglycerides [1.98 vs 1.56, p&lt;0.001], larger waist circumference [89.23 vs 86.39, p = 0.009] and lower high density lipoprotein [1.22 vs 1.32, p&lt;0.001]. The odds of developing metabolic syndrome were increased with age [OR = 1.05, CI: 1.02–1.07] and presence of a psychotic disorder [OR = 2.09 [CI 1.23–3.55]; and were reduced with female gender [OR 0.41, CI 0.25–0.67], among those who were never married [OR 0.52, CI 0.28–0.94] and among the widowed/separated/ divorced marital status [OR 0.38, CI 0.17–0.81]. While the majority of patients received treatment with olanzapine, there was no association between olanzapine use and metabolic syndrome and its components. More than half of the patients in this study sample were not receiving treatment for the various components of metabolic syndrome. Conclusion In the study setting of Eldoret, metabolic syndrome and its components were more prevalent among patients with psychotic disorders than in controls; and a clear treatment gap for these disorders was evident. There is a need for efforts to ensure adequate screening and treatment for these physical disorders in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3119127498,"Study of vocal fold (VF) mucosal biology requires essential human vocal fold epithelial cell (hVFE) lines for use in appropriate model systems. We steadily transfected a retroviral construct containing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) into primary normal hVFE to establish a continuously replicating hVFE cell line. Immortalized hVFE across passages have cobblestone morphology, express epithelial markers cytokeratin 4, 13 and 14, induced hTERT gene and protein expression, have similar RNAseq profiling, and can continuously grow for more than 8 months. DNA fingerprinting and karyotype analysis demonstrated that immortalized hVFE were consistent with the presence of a single cell line. Validation of the hVFE, in a three-dimensional in vitro VF mucosal construct revealed a multilayered epithelial structure with VF epithelial cell markers. Wound scratch assay revealed higher migration capability of the immortalized hVFE on the surface of collagen-fibronectin and collagen gel containing human vocal fold fibroblasts (hVFF). Collectively, our report demonstrates the first immortalized hVFE from true VFs providing a novel and invaluable tool for the study of epithelial cell-fibroblast interactions that dictate disease and health of this specialized tissue."
https://openalex.org/W3119514511,"Regulation of sphingolipid metabolism plays a role in cellular homeostasis, and dysregulation of these pathways is involved in cancer progression. Previously, our reports identified ceramide as an anti-metastatic lipid. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical alterations in ceramide-centered metabolism of sphingolipids that were associated with metastatic potential. We established metastasis-prone sublines of SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells using an in vivo selection method. These cells showed decreases in ceramide levels and ceramide synthase (CerS) 2 expression. Moreover, CerS2 downregulation in ovarian cancer cells promoted metastasis in vivo and potentiated cell motility and invasiveness. Moreover, CerS2 knock-in suppressed the formation of lamellipodia required for cell motility in this cell line. In order to define specific roles of ceramide species in cell motility controlled by CerS2, the effect of exogenous long- and very long-chain ceramide species on the formation of lamellipodia was evaluated. Treatment with distinct ceramides increased cellular ceramides and had inhibitory effects on the formation of lamellipodia. Interestingly, blocking the recycling pathway of ceramides by a CerS inhibitor was ineffective in the suppression of exogenous C24:1 -ceramide for the formation of lamellipodia. These results suggested that C24:1 -ceramide, a CerS2 metabolite, predominantly suppresses the formation of lamellipodia without the requirement for deacylation/reacylation. Moreover, knockdown of neutral ceramidase suppressed the formation of lamellipodia concomitant with upregulation of C24:1 -ceramide. Collectively, the CerS2-C24:1 -ceramide axis, which may be countered by neutral ceramidase, is suggested to limit cell motility and metastatic potential. These findings may provide insights that lead to further development of ceramide-based therapy and biomarkers for metastatic ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3120251128,"Identification of the population frequencies of definitely pathogenic germline variants in two major hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) genes, BRCA1/2 , is essential to estimate the number of HBOC patients. In addition, the identification of moderately penetrant HBOC gene variants that contribute to increasing the risk of breast and ovarian cancers in a population is critical to establish personalized health care. A prospective cohort subjected to genome analysis can provide both sets of information. Computational scoring and prospective cohort studies may help to identify such likely pathogenic variants in the general population. We annotated the variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes from a dataset of 3,552 whole-genome sequences obtained from members of a prospective cohorts with genome data in the Tohoku Medical Megabank Project (TMM) with InterVar software. Computational impact scores (CADD_phred and Eigen_raw) and minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of pathogenic (P) and likely pathogenic (LP) variants in ClinVar were used for filtration criteria. Familial predispositions to cancers among the 35,000 TMM genome cohort participants were analyzed to verify the identified pathogenicity. Seven potentially pathogenic variants were newly identified. The sisters of carriers of these moderately deleterious variants and definite P and LP variants among members of the TMM prospective cohort showed a statistically significant preponderance for cancer onset, from the self-reported cancer history. Filtering by computational scoring and MAF is useful to identify potentially pathogenic variants in BRCA genes in the Japanese population. These results should help to follow up the carriers of variants of uncertain significance in the HBOC genes in the longitudinal prospective cohort study."
https://openalex.org/W3118238172,"Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) has been implicated in promoting apoptosis and neuroinflammation in neurological disorders; however, its role in neural transplantation remains unknown. In this study, we cultured and differentiated Lund human mesencephalic (LUHMES) cells into human dopaminergic-like neurons and found that LCN2 mRNA was progressively induced in mouse brain after the intrastriatal transplantation of human dopaminergic-like neurons. The induction of LCN2 protein was detected in a subset of astrocytes and neutrophils infiltrating the core of the engrafted sites, but not in neurons and microglia. LCN2-immunoreactive astrocytes within the engrafted sites expressed lower levels of A1 and A2 astrocytic markers. Recruitment of microglia, neutrophils, and monocytes after transplantation was attenuated in LCN2 deficiency mice. The expression of M2 microglial markers was significantly elevated and survival of engrafted neurons was markedly improved after transplantation in LCN2 deficiency mice. Brain type organic cation transporter (BOCT), the cell surface receptor for LCN2, was induced in dopaminergic-like neurons after differentiation, and treatment with recombinant LCN2 protein directly induced apoptosis in dopaminergic-like neurons in a dose-dependent manner. Our results, therefore, suggested that LCN2 is a neurotoxic factor for the engrafted neurons and a modulator of neuroinflammation. LCN2 inhibition may be useful in reducing rejection after neural transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3118436312,"Insect pests cause serious damage in crop production, and various attempts have been made to produce insect-resistant crops, including the expression of genes for proteins with anti-herbivory activity, such as Bt ( Bacillus thuringiensis ) toxins. However, the number of available genes with sufficient anti-herbivory activity is limited. MLX56 is an anti-herbivory protein isolated from the latex of mulberry plants, and has been shown to have strong growth-suppressing activity against the larvae of a variety of lepidopteran species. As a model of herbivore-resistant plants, we produced transgenic tomato lines expressing the gene for MLX56. The transgenic tomato lines showed strong anti-herbivory activities against the larvae of the common cutworm, Spodoptera litura . Surprisingly, the transgenic tomato lines also exhibited strong activity against the attack of western flower thrips, Frankliniera occidentalis . Further, growth of the hadda beetle, Henosepilachna vigintioctopunctata , fed on leaves of transgenic tomato was significantly retarded. The levels of damage caused by both western flower thrips and hadda beetles were negligible in the high-MLX56-expressing tomato line. These results indicate that introduction of the gene for MLX56 into crops can enhance crop resistance against a wide range of pest insects, and that MLX56 can be utilized in developing genetically modified (GM) pest-resistant crops."
https://openalex.org/W3119502157,"Interleukin 33 (IL33) signaling has been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy and in pregnancy disorders. The goal of this project was to evaluate the role of IL33 signaling in rat pregnancy. The rat possesses hemochorial placentation with deep intrauterine trophoblast invasion; features also characteristic of human placentation. We generated and characterized a germline mutant rat model for IL33 using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. IL33 deficient rats exhibited deficits in lung responses to an inflammatory stimulus (Sephadex G-200) and to estrogen-induced uterine eosinophilia. Female rats deficient in IL33 were fertile and exhibited pregnancy outcomes (gestation length and litter size) similar to wild-type rats. Placental weight was adversely affected by the disruption of IL33 signaling. A difference in pregnancy-dependent adaptations to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure was observed between wild-type and IL33 deficient pregnancies. Pregnancy in wild-type rats treated with LPS did not differ significantly from pregnancy in vehicle-treated wild-type rats. In contrast, LPS treatment decreased fetal survival rate, fetal and placental weights, and increased fetal growth restriction in IL33 deficient rats. In summary, a new rat model for investigating IL33 signaling has been established. IL33 signaling participates in the regulation of placental development and protection against LPS-induced fetal and placental growth restriction."
https://openalex.org/W3120386786,"Chromatin accessibility is central to basal and inducible gene expression. Through ATAC-seq experiments in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and integration with multi-omics data, we found estradiol (E2) induced chromatin accessibility changes in a small number of breast cancer-relevant E2-regulated genes. As expected, open chromatin regions associated with E2-inducible gene expression showed enrichment of estrogen response element (ERE) and those associated with E2-repressible gene expression were enriched for ERE, PBX1, and PBX3. While a significant number of open chromatin regions showed pioneer factor FOXA1 occupancy in the absence of E2, E2-treatment further enhanced FOXA1 occupancy suggesting that ER-E2 enhances chromatin occupancy of FOXA1 to a subset of E2-regulated genes. Surprisingly, promoters of 80% and enhancers of 60% of E2-inducible genes displayed closed chromatin configuration both in the absence and presence of E2. Integration of ATAC-seq data with ERα ChIP-seq data revealed that ~40% ERα binding sites in the genome are found in chromatin regions that are not accessible as per ATAC-seq. Such ERα binding regions were enriched for binding sites of multiple nuclear receptors including ER, ESRRB, ERRγ, COUP-TFII (NR2F2), RARα, EAR2 as well as traditional pioneer factors FOXA1 and GATA3. Similar data were also obtained when ERα ChIP-seq data were integrated with MNase-seq and DNase-seq data sets. In summation, our results reveal complex mechanisms of ER-E2 interaction with nucleosomes. Notably, ""closed chromatin"" configuration as defined by ATAC-seq or by other techniques is not necessarily associated with lack of gene expression and technical limitations may preclude ATAC-seq to demonstrate accessibility of chromatin regions that are bound by ERα."
https://openalex.org/W3118356045,"The subject of this research is one of the main preconditions for the provision of high-quality social care services for people over the age of 65 with lowered self-sufficiency. It involves the spatial accessibility of formally established nursing services examined in 76 districts of the Czech Republic. The aim of this article is to identify and evaluate the gaps in spatial accessibility of the selected residential and outpatient-clinic services at the level of districts in individual regions of the Czech Republic in 2018. A three-phase analysis was performed, including an ArcGIS network analysis, multi-criteria evaluation according to the TOPSIS method, and a correlation analysis encompassing the confidence interval gained via the Bootstrap method. Seven indicators were selected—recipients of the allowance for the care, capacity of residential and outpatient-clinic services, and four indicators of accessibility via individual and public transport within the set time intervals. The results show good availability of residential care (no gap) within 30 min. by individual and public transport in most districts (94%). However, day services centers do not have a space gap in only 28% of districts by individual transport, and 8% of districts by public transport. In the case of day care centers, 54% of districts by individual transport, and 29% of districts by public transport do not have a space gap. The results also show that the level of spatial availability of care (gaps) in the district is not related to the number of people aged 65+ with reduced self-sufficiency in the district. On the contrary, the correlation analysis shows that with the growing number of people aged 65+ with reduced self-sufficiency in the district, the capacity of residential and outpatient services increases and the gaps in spatial accessibility do not decrease."
https://openalex.org/W3119891294,"Introduction Chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms and the absence of structural gastrointestinal abnormalities. Individuals with CIC typically institute dietary changes and use stool softeners or over-the-counter (OTC) laxatives, possibly at the direction of a healthcare provider, before prescription medications for CIC are initiated. Although highly prevalent, there is limited information regarding CIC patient experiences with OTC medications. Methods This post-hoc analysis used patient-reported data from a questionnaire administered during patient screening for a prospective linaclotide Phase 3b clinical trial in patients with CIC (N = 1482 screened). The questionnaire asked patients to report their experiences with OTC CIC medications over the preceding 6 months. Results Among patients with screening responses (N = 1423), most were female (85%) and white (66%), with a mean age of 48.9 years. A high proportion of patients had used one or more OTC medications (70% had ≥1 OTC; 19% had ≥3 OTCs), with the majority being bisacodyl (33%) and polyethylene glycol (30%). The most commonly cited reason for stopping an OTC medication was insufficient symptom relief (17–40%). The majority of patients taking OTC medications reported no or little satisfaction with the medication’s effect on their constipation (62%) and CIC-specific abdominal symptoms (78%). Many patients had little to no confidence in bowel movement (BM) frequency after taking OTC medications and their confidence in their ability to predict BM timing was also low (49–81% not at all confident). Conclusions Treatment effects on individual CIC symptoms, predictability of bowel habits, and satisfaction with treatment are all important factors for healthcare providers and patients to consider when establishing an effective treatment regimen for CIC.

In this work, low-CRI coke (coke A) and high-CRI coke (coke B) were charged into a thermogravimetric analyzer to separately study their microstructural changes, gasification characteristics, and reaction mechanism under simulated cohesive zone conditions in a blast furnace. The results show that both coke A and coke B underwent pyrolysis, polycondensation, and graphitization during the heat treatment. The pyrolysis, polycondensation, gasification speed, and dissolution speed rates of coke B were higher than those of coke A. Direct and indirect reduction between sinter and coke occurred in the cohesive zone and had different stages. The consumption rate of coke B was faster than that of coke A during the coke–sinter reduction. The carbon molecules of coke A must absorb more energy to break away from the skeleton than those of coke B."
https://openalex.org/W3120466586,"Background Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease and psoriatic arthritis is a common coexisting condition. Cardiorespiratory fitness is the overall capacity to perform exertion exercise. Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with negative health outcomes. Individuals with psoriasis have lower cardiorespiratory fitness compared with individuals without psoriasis. There are no previous studies exploring the association between cardiorespiratory fitness and new-onset psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Methods With the objective to investigate whether low cardiorespiratory fitness in late adolescence increases the risk for onset of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, a cohort of Swedish men in compulsory military service between 1968 and 2005 was created using data from the Swedish Military Service Conscription Register. Cardiorespiratory fitness, estimated by maximum capacity cycle ergometer testing at conscription, was divided into three groups: high, medium, and low. Diagnoses were obtained using the Swedish National Patient Register and cohort members were followed from conscription until an event, new-onset psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis, occurred, or at the latest until 31 December 2016. Cox regression models adjusted for confounders at conscription were used to obtain hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for incident psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Results During the follow-up period (median follow-up time 31 years, range 0–48 years), 20,679 cases of incident psoriasis and 6,133 cases of incident psoriatic arthritis were found among 1,228,562 men (mean age at baseline 18.3 years). There was a significant association between low cardiorespiratory fitness and incident psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (hazard ratio 1.35 (95% confidence interval 1.26–1.44) and 1.44 (95% confidence interval 1.28–1.63), respectively). Conclusions These novel findings suggest that low cardiorespiratory fitness at an early age is associated with increased risk of incident psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis among men, and highlight the importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness early in life."
https://openalex.org/W3120609989,"Mitochondrial derangement is an important contributor to the pathophysiology of muscular dystrophies and may be among the earliest cellular deficits. We have previously shown that disruption of Mss51, a mammalian skeletal muscle protein that localizes to the mitochondria, results in enhanced muscle oxygen consumption rate, increased endurance capacity, and improved limb muscle strength in mice with wildtype background. Here, we investigate whether Mss51 deletion in the mdx murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx-Mss51 KO) counteracts the muscle pathology and mitochondrial irregularities observed in mdx mice. We found that mdx-Mss51 KO mice had increased myofiber oxygen consumption rates and an amelioration of muscle histopathology compared to mdx counterparts. This corresponded with greater treadmill endurance and less percent fatigue in muscle physiology, but no improvement in forelimb grip strength or limb muscle force production. These findings suggest that although Mss51 deletion ameliorates the skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration defects in mdx and improves fatigue resistance in vivo, the lack of improvement in force production suggests that this target alone may be insufficient for a therapeutic effect."
https://openalex.org/W3118584943,"Background The measles Supplementary Immunization Activity (SIA) was implemented in June, 2017 to close immunity gaps by providing an additional opportunity to vaccinate children aged between 9 months and up to 14 years in Lilongwe District, Malawi. This study was conducted to determine the proportion of eligible children that were reached by the 2017 measles SIA among those children with or without history of measles vaccination, and possible reasons for non-vaccination. Methods A cross-sectional survey using mixed methods was conducted. Caretakers of children who were eligible for the 2017 measles SIA were sampled from 19 households from each of the 25 clusters (villages) that were randomly selected in Lilongwe District. A child was taken to have been vaccinated if the caretaker was able to explain when and where the child was vaccinated. Eight Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were conducted with planners and health care workers who were involved in the implementation of the 2017 measles SIA. Modified Poisson regression was used to examine the association between non-vaccination and child, caretaker and household related factors. A thematic analysis of transcripts from KIIs was also conducted to explore health system factors associated with non-vaccination of eligible children in this study. Results A total of 476 children and their caretakers were surveyed. The median age of the children was 52.0 months. Overall, 41.2% [95% CI 36.8–45.7] of the children included in the study were not vaccinated during the SIA. Only 59.6% of children with previous measles doses received SIA dose; while 77% of those without previous measles vaccination were reached by the SIA. Low birth order, vaccination history under routine services, low level of education among caretakers, unemployment of the household head, younger household head, provision of insufficient information by health authorities about the SIA were significantly associated with non-vaccination among eligible children during the 2017 measles SIA. Qualitative findings revealed strong beliefs against vaccinations, wrong perceptions about the SIA (from caretakers’ perspectives), poor delivery of health education, logistical and human resource challenges as possible reasons for non-vaccination. Conclusion Many children (41%) were left unvaccinated during the SIA and several factors were found to be associated with this finding. The Lilongwe District Health Team should endeavor to optimize routine immunization program; and community mobilization should be intensified as part of SIA activities."
https://openalex.org/W3119968970,"Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that mediate the circadian entrainment by light in plants and animals. They are also involved in magnetic field sensing in some animals. Recent studies suggest that cryptochromes play an essential role in metabolism and cardiovascular disease. However, the tissue-specific function of cryptochromes in atherosclerosis is unknown. We transplanted bone marrow from wild-type (WT) and cryptochrome 1/2 knockout (Cry1/2 KO) mice into irradiated recipient low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-/- ) mice and induced atherosclerosis with a high cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. There was a reduction in atherosclerotic plaques and macrophage accumulation in the aorta of LDLR-/- mice that received Cry1/2 KO bone marrow compared to mice that received WT bone marrow. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from Cry1/2 KO mice exhibited impaired uptake of low-density lipoprotein, and subsequently, impaired foam cell formation. Analysis of macrophage mRNA circadian oscillations revealed that the circadian rhythm of the LDLR mRNAs was lost in Cry1/2 KO BMDMs. Reinstalling the circadian oscillatory LDLR mRNAs using adenovirus into the BMDMs was able to rescue the lipid uptake and foam cell formation function. However, the noncircadian oscillatory LDLR mRNAs exhibited reduced ability to rescue the macrophage functions. These findings indicate that cryptochromes in bone marrow-derived cells are critical mediators of atherosclerosis through regulation of the LDLR mRNA circadian rhythm. Therapeutic measures targeting cryptochromes in the macrophage may have important implications for atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3119811020,"Brazil nut is one of the most important species of the Amazon due to its socioeconomic importance. Especially in homogeneous production systems, it may be susceptible to damage by wood-boring insects, as by the subfamily Scolytinae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae); thus, inadequate management conditions can cause economic damage. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to evaluate the occurrence of wood-boring insects (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) in native and homogeneous systems of Brazil nut in the Meridional Amazonian, Brazil. The study was conducted in three environments: Brazil Nut Native Anthropized, Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Brazil Nut Native Preserved. Twelve ethanol (96° GL) traps were installed in each environment during four sampling periods. The data were submitted to entomofaunistic analysis, Pearson´s correlation analysis and cluster analysis. A total of 2,243 individuals from 31 species were sampled, of which 23 were from the Brazil Nut Native Anthropized nut, 24 from the Homogeneous Brazil Nut and 26 from the Brazil Nut Native Preserved. Some species are restricted to a specific environment, such as Corthylocurus vernaculus Wood &amp; Bright, 1992 and Xyleborus biconicus Eggers, 1928, in relation to Brazil Nut Native Anthropized, Xyleborus tolimanus Eggers, 1928 that occurred only in Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Corthylus antennarius Schedl and Hypothenus bolivianus Wood &amp; Bright, 1992 verified only in Brazil Nut Native Preserved. In the faunistic analysis, we highlight the species Xyleborus affinis (Eichhoff, 1868), which was the most representative one in the three environments and a super-dominant species in all four sampling periods. Among the species considered indicator due to their high representativeness in the sampling, only Premnobius cavipennis Eichhoff, 1878 showed a significant negative correlation between its abundance and the minimum temperature for environments Homogeneous Brazil Nut and Brazil Nut Native Preserved. There was a greater similarity between the Brazil Nut Native Anthropized and the Brazil Nut Native Preserved; these two environments showed dissimilarity with the Homogeneous Brazil Nut. Monitoring wood-boring insects in Brazil nut agroecosystems is fundamental for the establishment of integrated pest management strategies."

This paper compares the traits of cities with different street networks using the tools of urban economics. When both cities have commuting arteries of the same length, cities with circular streets have higher population densities unless access to these arteries is expensive and the number of arteries is large. Cities with arteries set at a 45 o angle to the grid have smaller population densities under all circumstances."
https://openalex.org/W3119990774,"Background In combating the increasing trend of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) over the last two decades in the country, the Ministry of Health Malaysia developed the Enhanced Primary Health Care (EnPHC) initiative to improve care management across different levels of the public service delivery network. An evaluation research component was embedded to explore the implementation issues in terms of fidelity, feasibility, adaptation and benefit of the initiative’s components which were triage, care coordination, screening, risk management and referral system. Methods A mixed methods study was conducted at 20 participating EnPHC clinics in Johor and Selangor, two months after the intervention was initiated. Data collected from self-reported forms and a structured observation checklist were descriptively analysed. In-depth interviews were also conducted with 20 participants across the clinics selected to clarify any information gaps observed in each clinic, and data were thematically analysed. Results Evaluation showed that all components of EnPHC intervention had been successfully implemented except for the primary triage counter and visit checklist. The challenges were mainly discovered in terms of human resource and physical structure. Although human resource was a common implementation challenge across all interventions, clinic-specific issues could still be identified. Among the adaptive measures taken were task sharing among staff and workflow modification to match the clinic’s capacity. Despite the challenges, early benefits of implementation were highlighted especially in terms of service outcomes. Conclusions The evaluation study disclosed issues of human resource and physical infrastructure when a supplementary intervention is implemented. To successfully achieve a scaled-up PHC service delivery model based on comprehensive management of NCDs patient-centred care, the adaptive measures in local clinic context highlight the importance of collaboration between good organisational process and good clinical practice and process."
https://openalex.org/W3120263438,"The vertical collaborative clustering aims to unravel the hidden structure of data (similarity) among different sites, which will help data owners to make a smart decision without sharing actual data. For example, various hospitals located in different regions want to investigate the structure of common disease among people of different populations to identify latent causes without sharing actual data with other hospitals. Similarly, a chain of regional educational institutions wants to evaluate their students’ performance belonging to different regions based on common latent constructs. The available methods used for finding hidden structures are complicated and biased to perform collaboration in measuring similarity among multiple sites. This study proposes vertical collaborative clustering using a bit plane slicing approach (VCC-BPS), which is simple and unique with improved accuracy, manages collaboration among various data sites. The VCC-BPS transforms data from input space to code space, capturing maximum similarity locally and collaboratively at a particular bit plane. The findings of this study highlight the significance of those particular bits which fit the model in correctly classifying class labels locally and collaboratively. Thenceforth, the data owner appraises local and collaborative results to reach a better decision. The VCC-BPS is validated by Geyser, Skin and Iris datasets and its results are compared with the composite dataset. It is found that the VCC-BPS outperforms existing solutions with improved accuracy in term of purity and Davies-Boulding index to manage collaboration among different data sites. It also performs data compression by representing a large number of observations with a small number of data symbols."
