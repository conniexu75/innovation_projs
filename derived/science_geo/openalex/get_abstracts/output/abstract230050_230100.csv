https://openalex.org/W2111567059,"Huntington disease is one of nine inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by a polyglutamine tract expansion. Expanded polyglutamine proteins accumulate abnormally in intracellular aggregates. Here we show that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is sequestered in polyglutamine aggregates in cell models, transgenic mice and human brains. Sequestration of mTOR impairs its kinase activity and induces autophagy, a key clearance pathway for mutant huntingtin fragments. This protects against polyglutamine toxicity, as the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin attenuates huntingtin accumulation and cell death in cell models of Huntington disease, and inhibition of autophagy has the converse effects. Furthermore, rapamycin protects against neurodegeneration in a fly model of Huntington disease, and the rapamycin analog CCI-779 improved performance on four different behavioral tasks and decreased aggregate formation in a mouse model of Huntington disease. Our data provide proof-of-principle for the potential of inducing autophagy to treat Huntington disease."

https://openalex.org/W2060618743,"Transcription factors are believed to have a dominant role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This idea is supported by analysis of gene-knockout mice, which uncovered crucial roles of several transcription factors in normal hematopoiesis, and of individuals with leukemia, in whom transcription factors are frequently downregulated or mutated. However, analysis of knockout animals has not shown a direct link between abrogated transcription factors and the pathogenesis of AML. Sfpi1, encoding the lineage-specific transcription factor PU.1, is indispensable for normal myeloid and lymphoid development. We found that mice carrying hypomorphic Sfpi1 alleles that reduce PU.1 expression to 20% of normal levels, unlike mice carrying homo- or heterozygous deletions of Sfpi1, developed AML. Unlike complete or 50% loss, 80% loss of PU.1 induced a precancerous state characterized by accumulation of an abnormal precursor pool retaining responsiveness to G-CSF with disruption of M- and GM-CSF pathways. Malignant transformation was associated with a high frequency of clonal chromosomal changes. Retroviral restoration of PU.1 expression rescued myeloid differentiation of mutant progenitors and AML blasts. These results suggest that tightly graded reduction, rather than complete loss, of a lineage-indispensable transcription factor can induce AML."

https://openalex.org/W2082546405,"We report the production of two very long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in substantial quantities in a higher plant. This was achieved using genes encoding enzymes participating in the omega3/6 Delta8 -desaturation biosynthetic pathways for the formation of C20 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Arabidopsis thaliana was transformed sequentially with genes encoding a Delta9 -specific elongating activity from Isochrysis galbana, a Delta8 -desaturase from Euglena gracilis and a Delta5 -desaturase from Mortierella alpina. Instrumental in the successful reconstitution of these C20 polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways was the I. galbana C18-Delta9 -elongating activity, which may bypass rate-limiting steps present in the conventional Delta6 -desaturase/elongase pathways. The accumulation of EPA and AA in transgenic plants is a breakthrough in the search for alternative sustainable sources of fish oils."

https://openalex.org/W2158776028,"In the integrin family, the collagen receptors form a structurally and functionally distinct subgroup. Two members of this subgroup, α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, are known to bind to monomeric form of type I collagen. However, in tissues type I collagen monomers are organized into large fibrils immediately after they are released from cells. Here, we studied collagen fibril recognition by integrins. By an immunoelectron microscopy method we showed that integrin α2I domain is able to bind to classical D-banded type I collagen fibrils. However, according to the solid phase binding assay, the collagen fibril formation appeared to reduce integrin α1I and α2I domain avidity to collagen and to lower the number of putative αI domain binding sites on it. Respectively, cellular α1β1 integrin was able to mediate cell spreading significantly better on monomeric than on fibrillar type I collagen matrix, whereas α2β1 integrin appeared still to facilitate both cell spreading on fibrillar type I collagen matrix and also the contraction of fibrillar type I collagen gel. Additionally, α2β1 integrin promoted the integrin-mediated formation of long cellular projections typically induced by fibrillar collagen. Thus, these findings suggest that α2β1 integrin is a functional cellular receptor for type I collagen fibrils, whereas α1β1 integrin may only effectively bind type I collagen monomers. Furthermore, when the effect of soluble αI domains on type I collagen fibril formation was tested in vitro, the observations suggest that integrin type collagen receptors might guide or even promote pericellular collagen fibrillogenesis. In the integrin family, the collagen receptors form a structurally and functionally distinct subgroup.

Furthermore, when the effect of soluble αI domains on type I collagen fibril formation was tested in vitro, the observations suggest that integrin type collagen receptors might guide or even promote pericellular collagen fibrillogenesis. A fibril-forming type I collagen, a ubiquitous protein in all vertebrates, is known to provide mechanical stability for tissues and serve as a functional environment for cells (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Google Scholar). Depending on the physical properties of the tissue, type I collagen fibrils are arranged with different suprafibrillar architectures and diameters. Thus, narrow fibrils (∼20 nm) in highly ordered arrangement occur in the cornea, where optical transparency is important, whereas large diameter fibrils (∼500 nm) provide high tensile strength in mature tendon (2Hulmes J. J. Struct. Biol. 2002; 137: 2-10Google Scholar). The mechanism of type I collagen fibril formation has been under extensive research for decades. In tissues, type I collagen is synthesized as a monomeric precursor, which is secreted by exocytosis into the extracellular space. In addition to the triple helical collagenous domain, the precursor contains noncollagenous C- and N-propeptides, which are linked to the triple helical domain by short sequences called telopeptides (3van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Google Scholar). After the enzymatic removal of propeptides, the solubility of collagen monomers decreases, and they spontaneously form fibrils, assisted by remaining nonhelical telopeptides (1Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Google Scholar, 4Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36083-36088Google Scholar). Evidently, collagen molecules themselves contain all the information needed for fibril assembly. Therefore, in physiological conditions, acid-solubilized collagen monomers form tissue-type long fibrils with characteristic axial periodic structure also in vitro (5Wood G.C. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 598-605Google Scholar, 6Wood G.C. Biochem. J. 1960; 75: 605-612Google Scholar, 7Kadler K. Holmes D. Trotter J. Chapman J. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 1-8Google Scholar). However, self-assembly cannot by itself explain the diverse morphologies of collagen fibrils found in different tissues. In fact, several collagen binding extracellular matrix molecules, decorin, fibromodulin and lumican among others, have been found to influence the size of type I collagen fibrils (8Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Google Scholar, 9Chakravati S. Magnuson T. Lass J. Jepsen K. LaMantia C. Carrol H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1277-1286Google Scholar, 10Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F. Fassler R. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9636-9647Google Scholar). Recently, also cell surface receptors, including integrins, were recognized to contribute to collagen polymerization indicating that the collagen fibril formation is under close cellular control (11Velling T. Risteli J. Wennerberg K. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37377-37381Google Scholar, 12Li S. Van Den Diepstraten C. D'Souza S.J. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1045-1056Google Scholar). The integrins are a large family of cell adhesion receptors involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In addition to their importance as anchoring molecules, these heterodimeric receptors transmit bidirectional signals that regulate many important aspects of cell behavior including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The integrin family contains four collagen receptors that are structurally closely related (13White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Google Scholar). Two well known collagen receptors are named α1β1 and α2β1 integrins, whereas the α10β1 and α11β1 integrins constitute the latest additions to the integrin family (14Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Google Scholar, 15Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Google Scholar, 16Camper L. Hellman U. Lundgren-Akerlund E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20383-20389Google Scholar, 17Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Google Scholar). Whereas all collagen receptor integrins share the common β1 integrin subunit, there are four unique α subunits, resulting in the four heterodimers. Unlike the other matrix receptor integrins, the collagen receptors have an independently folding structural domain, inserted domain (αI domain), which executes ligand recognition (10Svensson L. Aszodi A. Reinholt F. Fassler R. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9636-9647Google Scholar, 11Velling T. Risteli J. Wennerberg K. Mosher D.F. Johansson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37377-37381Google Scholar, 12Li S. Van Den Diepstraten C. D'Souza S.J. Chan B.M. Pickering J.G. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1045-1056Google Scholar, 13White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Google Scholar). This ∼200-amino acid domain is located in the integrin α subunit, between the second and third N-terminal blades of the β-propeller domain. The αI domain itself adopts a “Rossman fold” conformation, in which a central β-sheet is surrounded by α-helices forming a divalent metal binding site, referred to as MIDAS (18Lee J.O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Google Scholar). Despite the structural similarity of highly conserved αI domains, the small differences present may provide specific ligand binding characteristics for different integrins (19Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26006-26010Google Scholar, 20Kern A. Briesewitz R. Bank I. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22811-22816Google Scholar, 21Tulla M. Pentikäinen O. Viitasalo T.

Although α1β1 integrin is able bind to monomers of fibril-forming collagen types I, II, III, and V, it seems to favor other subtypes such as basement membrane type IV collagen (21Tulla M. Pentikäinen O. Viitasalo T. Käpylä J. Impola U. Nykvist P. Nissinen L. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48206-48212Google Scholar, 22Zhang W.M. Käpylä J. Puranen J.S. Knight C.G.

Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Google Scholar). Instead, α2β1 integrin is the major receptor for type I collagen and other fibril-forming collagens (21Tulla M. Pentikäinen O.

Laato M. Heino J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 263-272Google Scholar). Currently, less is known about ligand binding preferences of the novel α10β1 and α11β1 integrins. However, our previous results show that α10I domain resembles α1I rather than α2I in its ligand binding specificity (21Tulla M. Pentikäinen O. Viitasalo T. Käpylä J. Impola U. Nykvist P. Nissinen L. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48206-48212Google Scholar), suggesting that it may not be a better receptor for fibrillar collagen than α1I domain. Integrin α11I domain seems to bind most strongly to type I collagen, but it is not clear whether it can mediate high affinity interactions (22Zhang W.M. Käpylä J. Puranen J.S. Knight C.G. Tiger C.F. Pentikäinen O.T. Johnson M.S. Farndale R.W. Heino J. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7270-7277Google Scholar). Integrin type collagen receptors do not differ only in their ability to recognize distinct collagen subtypes, but they also transmit divergent signals into the cell. This may explain why many cell types express several collagen receptors concomitantly. Structurally similar α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are connected to distinct signaling pathways, often leading to opposite cellular responses. Whereas α1β1 integrin seems to stimulate cell proliferation (27Pozzi A. Wary K.K. Giancotti F.G. Gardner H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 587-594Google Scholar, 28Ekholm E. Hankenson K.D. Uusitalo H.

The properties of the recently identified α10β1 and α11β1 integrins are just beginning to receive attention and still remain to be identified. Specific recognition sites on the triple helical structures of different collagen subtypes can be recognized by a group of integrin type cell adhesion receptors (13White D.J. Puranen S. Johnson M.S. Heino J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1405-1410Google Scholar, 34Knight C. Morton L. Peachey A. Tuckwell D. Farndale R. Barnes M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35-40Google Scholar, 35Emsley J. Knight C. Farndale R. Barnes M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1019-1028Google Scholar). Although detailed information about integrin binding to the monomeric form of collagen is available, it has not been clear whether αI domains and the corresponding integrins can effectively support cell adhesion to complex collagen fibrils. The objective of this study is to provide further insight into α1β1 and α2β1 integrin interactions with the type I collagen fibril, the primary component of the extracellular matrix. Formation of Type I Collagen Fibrils—Bovine skin type I collagen (Vitrogen®, Cohesion, or Cellon S.A.) was diluted on ice with PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HGF, human gingival fibroblast(s); MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; BSA, bovine serum albumin. to final concentrations of 0.05, 0.1, or 0.5 mg/ml. To initiate collagen fibrillogenesis, samples were adjusted to physiological pH 7.4 with 1 m NaOH, and the temperature was increased from 4 to 37 °C. The progression of fibril formation was followed using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer by recording an optical density at 313 nm for 120 h. Finally, fibril quality was verified by transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1200EX, JEOL, Peabody, MA). For the electron microscopy analysis, fibrillogenesis of the samples was allowed to proceed between 60 min and 48 h at 37 °C. The temperature of monomeric samples was maintained below 4 °C. At each time point, collagen samples were spotted onto Formvar/carbon-coated copper electron microscopy grids for 1 h at 37 °C. Specimens were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Grids were embedded with 1.5% methyl cellulose and stained with 0.4% uranyl acetate for 10 min on ice. The Production of the Human Recombinant Integrin α1I and α2I Domains as GST Fusion Proteins—cDNAs encoding α1I and α2I domains were generated by PCR as described earlier (25Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Google Scholar) using human integrin α1 and α2 cDNAs as templates. Vectors pGEX-4T-3 and pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) were used to generate recombinant N-terminal GST fusion proteins of integrin α1I and α2I domains, respectively. For the protein production, transformed Escherichia coli BL21 cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin until the A600 of the suspension reached 1–2. Next, the protein overexpression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and it was allowed to proceed for an additional 4–6 h at room temperature before harvesting the bacterial cells by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Pelleted cells were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed by sonication. To permeabilize cell membranes, the disrupted bacterial cells were incubated with 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice, and soluble proteins were isolated from cell debris by centrifugation (34,500 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the supernatant, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. Glutathione-Sepharose beads with specifically bound GST fusion proteins were then collected by low speed centrifugation (500 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), and the slurry was transferred to disposable chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with PBS, and fusion proteins were eluted with 30 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma). GST-tagged α1I and α2I were then analyzed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant α1I domain contains 227 amino acids, corresponding to amino acids 123–338 of the whole α1 integrin subunit, whereas the recombinant α2I domain is 223 amino acids in length, consisting of amino acids 124–339 of the full-length α2 integrin subunit. The C termini of the α1I and α2I domains contain 10 and 6 nonintegrin amino acids, respectively. Collagen Binding Assay for Recombinant α1I and α2I Domains—To analyze the integrin binding to collagen, universal binding 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) were coated with either the monomeric or fibrillar form of type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml; Cellon S.A.) by 3.5-min exposure to UV light. Fibrillogenesis of type I collagen was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C before coating, whereas the monomeric state was maintained by keeping the sample on ice. Control wells were treated with Delfia® Diluent II containing BSA (Wallac) diluted 1:2 in PBS. Later the same solution was used for blocking the nonspecific protein absorption sites on all wells for 1 h at 37 °C. Next, GST-α1 and GST-α2 fusion proteins, at concentrations between 10 and 500 nm in Delfia® assay buffer (Wallac), were allowed to bind to collagen for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. All of the solutions used thereafter were supplemented with 2 mm MgCl2. Next, unbound GST-αI domains were removed by repeated PBS wash steps, and europium-labeled Delfia® GST antibody (Wallac), diluted depending on the preparation at 1:800 or 1:2000 in Delfia® assay buffer (Wallac), was added to the wells. After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, specimens were rinsed with PBS, and finally Delfia® enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well in order to dissociate the fluorescent europium label. Europium signal was determined by time-resolved fluorometry (Victor2 multilabel counter; Wallac). Each assay was performed at least in triplicate, and approximate dissociation constants were obtained by fitting the data to a Michaelis-Menten form equation. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance. The significance of difference between αI domain binding to the monomeric and to the fibrillar form of type I collagen was analyzed using two independent variables: the form of the collagen and αI domain concentration. Statistical significance was assigned at p < 0.05. Immunoelectron Microscopy Analysis of α1I and α2I Domain Binding to Collagen Fibrils—Type I collagen fibrillogenesis (0.1 mg/ml Vitrogen®, Cohesion) was initiated as described above. Following 48 h of fibril formation, type I collagen fibrils were spotted onto Formvar/carbon-coated copper electron microscopy grids for 1 h at 37 °C. In order to prevent the nonspecific protein binding, the residual binding sites on grids were blocked with 5% milk powder in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Then GST-α2I at concentrations of 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm was allowed to bind to collagen fibrils attached to the grids for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2. Before fixing the samples with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, unbound GST-α2I was removed by washing the samples with PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2. Next, specimens were first rinsed with PBS, and then collagen-bound GST-α2I domains were detected with the antibody against GST (Amersham Biosciences) diluted at 1:400 in 5% milk powder in PBS. After 1 h, the specimens were carefully washed with PBS, and bound primary antibody was localized with protein A-gold conjugate (∼10 nm; a kind gift from Dr. George Posthuma, University Medical Center Utrecht) diluted 1:65 in 5% milk powder in PBS. Following secondary antibody attachment for 30 min at room temperature, samples were washed with PBS and distilled water. Finally, grids were embedded with 1.5% methyl cellulose and stained with 0.4% uranyl acetate on ice for 10 min. Specimens were examined by transmission electron microscopy (JEM-1200EX; JEOL, Peabody, MA), and average numbers of bound GST-α2I or GST control per collagen fibril D-period were counted from representative micrographs. Finally, the dissociation constant for GST-α2I domain binding to fibrillar collagen was estimated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten form equation. GST was used as the background control. Integrin α1I and α2I Domains in Collagen Fibrillogenesis—In order to examine the effects of GST-αI domains on type I collagen fibrillogenesis, fibril assembly was monitored in the presence of GST-α1I or GST-α2I using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. Changes in turbidity were recorded at 313 nm at intervals of 1 min for 120 min. Fibrillogenesis of 330 μm type I collagen (0.1 mg/ml; Vitrogen) was analyzed in the presence of either 70 μm α1I-GST or α2I-GST at concentrations of 330, 165, 110, 80, 70, 30, and 15 μm. The effect of GST-α1I was analyzed both in the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 and in conditions where Mg2+ was made unavailable for protein binding using 2 mm EDTA as a chelating agent. Cell Cultures—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA), were used as hosts for transfection and expression of wild type integrin α1 or α2 subunits (25Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Google Scholar) as well as a D219N/D292N double mutant α2 subunit. Transfected cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin-G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml neomycin analogue G418. The human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was obtained from the ATCC, and it was also transfected to express integrin α2 subunit. Transfected cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 mg/ml G418. Wild type human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Stable Transfections—Integrin α1 cDNA (15Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Google Scholar) was a kind gift from Dr. E. Marcantonio (Columbia University, New York, NY), and integrin α2 cDNA (14Takada Y. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 397-407Google Scholar) was from Dr. M. Hemler (Dana-Farber Cancer Research Center, Boston, MA). Integrin α1 cDNA was ligated into a modified pLEN expression vector (15Briesewitz R. Epstein M.R. Marcantonio E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2989-2996Google Scholar), and integrin α2 cDNA was ligated into the pAWneo2 expression vector (36Ohashi P. Mak T. Van den Elsen P. Yanagi Y. Yoshikai Y. Calman A. Terhorst C. Stobo J. Weiss A. Nature. 1985; 316: 606-609Google Scholar), which carries the spleen focus-forming virus long terminal repeat promoter and a neomycin resistance gene (a kind gift from Dr. A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco, CA). Two site-specific point mutations, D219N and D292N, were introduced into full-length α2 cDNA, using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit, before the construct was transfected into CHO cells (37Käpylä J. Ivaska J. Riikonen R. Nykvist P. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 274: 3348-3354Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected by electroporation (0.3 kV, 960 microfarads, 0.4-cm cuvette in RPMI plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine, without serum) with 20 μg of pAWneo2 carrying either wild type or mutated α2 cDNA or with 20 μg of pLEN vector carrying α1 cDNA. Construct containing α1 integrin was co-transfected with 1 μg of pAWneo2 null expression vector (25Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Google Scholar). Transfection of Saos-2 cells with the α2-pAWneo2 construct was performed using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) essentially following the manufacturer's recommendations. Control cells were transfected with pAWneo2 null expression vector. Transfected cells were then plated and allowed to recover for 1 day in culture medium. Neomycin analogue G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the culture medium at 0.4–0.5 mg/ml, and G418-resistant clones were selected for 1–3 weeks before they were isolated and analyzed for their expression of α1 or α2 integrin. The cell surface expression levels of the integrins were checked by flow cytometry using antibodies against the integrin α subunit (SR-84 antibody for α1 integrin, a gift from Dr. W. Rettig (Boehringer Ingelheim) and 12F1 antibody for α2 integrin, a gift from Dr. V. Woods (University of California, San Diego) (25Nykvist P. Tu H. Ivaska J. Käpylä J. Pihlajaniemi T. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8255-8261Google Scholar). Cell Spreading Assays—Universal binding 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) were precoated with either monomeric or fibrillar type I collagen (0.5 mg/ml; Cellon S.A.) by exposing plates to UV light for 3.5 min. Before coating, fibril formation was allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C. Alternatively, wells were coated by allowing collagen fibril formation (0.05 mg/ml) to proceed for 48 h in the wells of a 96-well plate (Nunc) at 37 °C in a humid chamber. To maintain the monomeric state of the collagen solution, samples were kept on ice. Control wells were treated with PBS. The cell lines used were CHO cells transfected to express either α1β1 integrin (CHO-α1β1) or α2β1 integrin (CHO-α2β1), transfected Saos-2 cells, and wild type HGF cells. Semiconfluent cell cultures were detached with 0.01% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA for 3 min at 37 °C. Trypsin activity was inhibited by washing the cells either with 0.2% soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in a serum-free medium or with serum-supplemented medium. Serum was carefully removed with repeated washing steps when necessary, and cells were suspended in serum-free medium containing 50 μm cycloheximide (Sigma) to prevent de novo protein synthesis. Next, 26,000 CHO cells/cm2, 30,000 Saos-2 cells/cm2, or 15,000 HGF cells/cm2 were added to the collagen-coated microtiter plates. Nonspecific binding sites on all wells were blocked with 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of cells. After 2 h of cell spreading at 37 °C, medium containing non-adhered cells was poured out, and cells were fixed with 4% form-aldehyde and 5% sucrose for 30 min at room temperature. Cells in 16 representative fields from four replicate wells were analyzed using phase-contrast microscopy. The total number of cells attached and the percentage of spread cells were counted. A spread cell was characterized as one having a clearly visible ring of cytoplasm around the nucleus. The morphology of cells was further analyzed, and the percentage of cells that formed more than one long projection was determined. The statistical difference between cell spreading on monomeric or fibrillar type I collagen was analyzed using two-way analysis of variance. Three independent experiments were performed, and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Immunostaining of Integrin β1 Subunits—Fibrillogenesis of type I collagen (Vitrogen®, Cohesion) was allowed to proceed for 48 h at 37 °C on the surface of glass coverslips. Human gingival fibroblasts were prepared for the spreading experiment as described above. Following 120 min of cell spreading, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and 5% sucrose in PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS+) for 20 min. After washing, cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS+ for 4 min. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% BSA and 1% glycine in PBS+ for 30 min. To localize the β1-containing integrins on spread HGF cells, a polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β1 subunit (4080; a generous gift fr"

By controlling gene expression, TNFα orchestrates the cutaneous responses to environmental damage and inflammation. To define TNFα action in epidermis, we compared the transcriptional profiles of normal human keratinocytes untreated and treated with TNFα for 1, 4, 24, and 48 h by using oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that TNFα regulates not only immune and inflammatory responses but also tissue remodeling, cell motility, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Specifically, TNFα regulates innate immunity and inflammation by inducing a characteristic large set of chemokines, including newly identified TNFα targets, that attract neutrophils, macrophages, and skin-specific memory T-cells. This implicates TNFα in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, fixed drug eruption, atopic and allergic contact dermatitis. TNFα promotes tissue repair by inducing basement membrane components and collagen-degrading proteases. Unexpectedly, TNFα induces actin cytoskeleton regulators and integrins, enhancing keratinocyte motility and attachment, effects not previously associated with TNFα. Also unanticipated was the influence of TNFα upon keratinocyte cell fate by regulating cell-cycle and apoptosis-associated genes. Therefore, TNFα initiates not only the initiation of inflammation and responses to injury, but also the subsequent epidermal repair. The results provide new insights into the harmful and beneficial TNFα effects and define the mechanisms and genes that achieve these outcomes, both of which are important for TNFα-targeted therapies.

Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) 1The abbreviations used are: TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. is a multifunctional cytokine that mediates inflammation, immune response, and apoptosis (1Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Google Scholar). Inappropriate production or persistent activation of TNFα participates in a wide spectrum of diseases, including septic shock, diabetes, cancer, graft rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease (2McDermott M.F. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 2001; 47: 619-635Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that TNFα also has a significant role in normal development and homeostasis of several organs. Mice deficient in TNFα lack germinal centers and show increased susceptibility to microbial pathogens due to incomplete inflammatory responses (3Pasparakis M. Alexopoulou L. Episkopou V. Kollias G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1397-1411Google Scholar). TNFR1-mutant mice show similar abnormalities, in addition to defective formation of Peyer's patches (4Fu Y.X. Chaplin D.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 399-433Google Scholar). In skin, TNFα is the master cytokine regulator in inflammatory diseases, such as psoriasis, contact dermatitis, drug eruptions, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, etc. (5Ettehadi P. Greaves M.W. Wallach D. Aderka D. Camp R.D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 96: 146-151Google Scholar, 6Becke F.M. Hehlgans T. Brockhoff G. Mannel D.N. Eur. Cytokine Network. 2001; 12: 45-50Google Scholar, 7Teraki Y. Moriya N. Shiohara T. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 550-560Google Scholar). TNFα is found in skin after injury (8Kondo T. Ohshima T. Int. J. Legal Med. 1996; 108: 231-236Google Scholar, 9Wakefield P.E. James W.D. Samlaska C.P. Meltzer M.S. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1991; 24: 675-685Google Scholar, 10Kock A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Google Scholar) and is considered essential for angiogenesis during wound healing (11Leibovich S.J. Polverini P.J. Shepard H.M. Wiseman D.M. Shively V. Nuseir N. Nature. 1987; 329: 630-632Google Scholar). Agents targeting TNFα are now in clinical trials for treatment of inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis (12Wolf R. Matz H. Orion E. Ruocco V. Clin. Dermatol. 2002; 20: 522-530Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the TNFα action has not been sufficient to predict the full effects and side effects of such therapies because TNFα has a remarkable variety of functions and the anti-TNFα treatments can simultaneously affect many cellular processes in both abnormal and normal tissues (13Antoni C. Braun J. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2002; 20: S152-S157Google Scholar). TNFα is a homodimer of 157 amino acid subunits produced primarily by activated macrophages but also by other cell types, including epidermal keratinocytes (14Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar). A low level of TNFα is present in the upper layer of the healthy epidermis, but its synthesis and release from keratinocytes are greatly augmented by injury, infection, UV irradiation, and contact sensitizers (8Kondo T. Ohshima T. Int. J. Legal Med. 1996; 108: 231-236Google Scholar, 9Wakefield P.E. James W.D. Samlaska C.P. Meltzer M.S. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1991; 24: 675-685Google Scholar, 10Kock A. Schwarz T. Kirnbauer R. Urbanski A. Perry P. Ansel J.C. Luger T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1609-1614Google Scholar, 15Griffiths C.E. Barker J.N. Kunkel S. Nickoloff B.J. Br. J. Dermatol. 1991; 124: 519-526Google Scholar). Of the two distinct cell-surface receptors for TNFα, TNFR1 and TNFR2, keratinocytes mainly express TNFR1 (16Kondo S. Sauder D.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1713-1718Google Scholar). The binding of TNFα to TNFR1 triggers a series of intracellular events resulting in the activation of transcription factors, including NFκB, AP-1, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β, and others (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar), which are responsible for the induction of genes important for diverse biological processes, including cell growth and death, oncogenesis, and immune, inflammatory, and stress responses (14Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar). TNFα activates the immune responses through inducing the production of additional signals, such as interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-8, transforming growth factor type β (TGF-β), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), etc. (18Barker J.N. Mitra R.S. Griffiths C.E. Dixit V.M. Nickoloff B.J. Lancet. 1991; 337: 211-214Google Scholar). TNFα affects epidermis in cutaneous inflammatory diseases, and therefore we set out to identify and comprehensively analyze the TNFα-regulated genes in epidermal keratinocytes by using DNA microarrays. Several reports of microarray analyses of TNFα-regulated genes focused on cell lines or pathological conditions (19Murakami T. Mataki C. Nagao C. Umetani M. Wada Y. Ishii M. Tsutsumi S. Kohro T. Saiura A. Aburatani H. Hamakubo T. Kodama T. J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2000; 7: 39-44Google Scholar, 20Shakhov A.N. Lyakhov I.G. Tumanov A.V. Rubtsov A.V. Drutskaya L.N. Marino M.W. Nedospasov S.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 151-157Google Scholar, 21Zhou A. Scoggin S. Gaynor R.B. Williams N.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2054-2064Google Scholar). However, we decided to use primary cultures of healthy human epidermal keratinocytes and profile the transcriptional changes 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after TNFα treatment. The gene expression patterns were compared with the corresponding untreated control at each time point, which allowed us to describe novel responses not previously associated with TNFα action or cutaneous inflammation. We found that TNFα works fast, with many genes regulated already after 1 h. Among the regulated genes, we found those involved in immune and inflammatory responses, and although TNFα was known to regulate some of these, many are newly identified targets. Unexpectedly, TNFα regulates genes that affect the cell motility and cytoskeleton, which activates keratinocyte migration. TNFα also regulates genes involved in cell cycle and apoptosis, as well as basement membrane components and matrix metalloproteases. Because these genes and processes comprise important elements of wound-healing, we predict that impaired wound-healing will be recognized as a side-effect of TNFα-targeted therapies. The results indicate that TNFα affects a wide range of processes to integrate the epidermal responses to injury and suggest that TNFα is responsible not only for the initiation of inflammation, but also for the subsequent repair and regenerative processes. This finding has significant implications for the development of TNFα-targeted treatments. Human Keratinocyte Cultures and Cytokine Treatment—We used the approach described before (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Google Scholar, 23Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 650-664Google Scholar). Briefly, normal human neonatal foreskin epidermal keratinocytes were obtained from Dr. M. Simon (Living Skin Bank, Burn Unit SUNY, Stony Brook, NY). The cultures were initiated using 3T3 feeder layers and then frozen in liquid nitrogen until used. Once thawed, the keratinocytes were grown without feeder cells in a defined serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (KGM) supplemented with 2.5 ng/ml epidermal growth factor and 0.05 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract (keratinocyte-SFM, Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. We avoid using serum because it can promote certain aspects of keratinocyte differentiation. The medium was replaced every 2 days, and the cells were expanded through three passages for the experiments. They were trypsinized with 0.025% trypsin, which was neutralized with 0.5 mg/ml of trypsin inhibitor. For all experiments, third-passage keratinocytes were used at 50-70% confluence. These primary cultures provide a more appropriate target than immortalized, aneuploid cell lines, and by using a single large batch of cells, we avoided variability due to growth conditions. We changed the medium from KGM to keratinocyte basal medium without supplements 24 h before treatment to avoid the effects of the supplements in growth medium. Keratinocytes were treated with human recombinant TNFα (50 ng/ml, Sigma) and harvested by scraping at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h after treatment. To avoid effects of changes in keratinocyte physiology during their growth in cultures, each time point had a TNFα-treated and a corresponding untreated, control sample. The entire experiment was performed twice, each time by a different experimenter. Immunofluorescence Staining—Keratinocytes were grown on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) and incubated with KGM. The medium was changed to keratinocyte basal medium 24 h before cytokine treatment, as described above. The cells were treated with TNFα (50 ng/ml). At several time points after treatment, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then immediately fixed with 70% methanol (NFκB staining) for 10 min. After rinses with PBS, the cells were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. After this, the cells were further incubated with a 1:200 dilution of FITC-labeled anti-IgG (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The stained cells were observed under the microscope (Zeiss, Axiophot), and images were captured with a digital photo camera (DKC-5000, Sony). To visualize F-actin, we fixed the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and used fluorescein-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at the dilution of 1:40 after permeabilization of the cell membranes with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. To detect apoptotic cells, we used the DeadEnd fluorometric terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling system (Promega), which measures the fragmented DNA by catalytically incorporating fluorescein-12-dUTP at 3′-OH DNA ends using the enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Nucleus was counterstained with propidium iodide-containing mounting medium (Vector Labs). The stained cells were observed under the microscope and photographed. Time-lapse photographs were obtained at 30-min intervals with a digital camera (CoolPix, Nikon). Preparation of Labeled cRNA and GeneChip™ Hybridization—We isolated total RNA from the cells with RNeasy kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 5-8 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed, amplified, and labeled as described (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Google Scholar). Fifteen micrograms of labeled cRNA was hybridized to HGU95Av2 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were washed, stained with anti-biotin streptavidin-phycoerythrin-labeled antibody, and scanned using the Agilent GeneArray™ scanner system (Hewlett-Packard). Northern Blotting—For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The probes were synthesized using keratinocyte RNA and the RT-PCR kit (Promega) with the following primers: EFNA1, 5′-CTGAAGAGAGGGACAGGCAC-3′ and 5′-TGCACAGCTTGTTTCTTTGG-3′; NINJ1, 5′-AACGTGAACCATTACGC-3′ and 5′-GTTGTTAAGGTCGTACTTGAC-3′; SOD2, 5′-GTTGGCCAAGGGAGATGTTA-3′ and 5′-CTGATTTGGACAAGCAGCAA-3′; MMP9, 5′-GGGCTACGTGACCTAT-3′ and 5′-TCCAAGTTTATTAGAAACACTCC-3′; CCND2, 5′-GGTAGGCTCAGATGTCG-3′ and 5′-ACCGTTTAGTACCGCT-3′; NFκB1, 5′-ACAAATGGGCTACACCGAAG-3′ and 5′-TAGGGCTTTGGTTTACACGG-3′; TNFAIP2, 5′-CCTATTGCCGTGACAGGTTT-3′ and 5′-AAATATGTAGCTGGGCGTGG-3′; TGM-1, 5′-GCTTAGCTACCTACGCACGG-3′ and 5′-GCCACTGCTAGTCTCTTGGG-3′; IVL, 5′-AAAGCAGAAAACCCAGAGCA-3′ and 5′-CTCTAGGTGCTTCAGGTGCC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-ACAGTCAGCCGCATCTTCTT-3′ and 5′-GACAAGCTTCCCGTTCTCAG-3′. Gel-purified reverse transcription-PCR products were labeled with [32P]dCTP using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) and cleaned through MicroSpin columns (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridizations were performed using ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) at 68 °C for 1 h. The signals from the hybridized membrane were captured on Biomax MS film (Kodak). Array Data Analysis—Generally, we used the same data analysis approach as before (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Google Scholar, 23Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 650-664Google Scholar). The entire experiment was performed twice, which means that all microarray data points were independently obtained in duplicates. To compare data from multiple arrays, the signal of each probe array was scaled to the same target intensity value. We used Microsuite version 5.0 (Affymetrix) for data extraction. Differential expressions of transcripts were determined by calculating the fold change between the signal intensity values from the TNFα-treated cells and corresponding control cells, using GeneChip™ data-mining software DMT3.0, Affymetrix). Duplicate experiments were compared using both a Student's t test and a Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. We did not consider either genes deemed absent from all 16 microarrays or genes expressed at levels sufficiently low that expression values remained below 50 arbitrary units in all 16 microarrays, because we consider these values insufficiently reliable. To improve reliability, we checked individually the absolute expression levels and p values among all four time points. Genes were considered regulated if both criteria were met: (i) at least one statistical test must find the gene regulated, and (ii) the average expression level difference in the duplicate experiments must be more than 2-fold relative to untreated control at any time point. 2The hierarchical clustering was performed by using algorithms available on the World Wide Web at rana.stanford.edu/software. We developed an extensive gene annotation table describing the molecular function and biological category of the genes present on the chip. The table is based primarily on the Gene Ontology Consortium data 3Available on the World Wide Web at cgap.nci.nih.gov/Genes/GOBrowser. and the data by J. M. Rouillard. 4Available on the World Wide Web at dot.ped.med.umich.edu:2000/ourimage/pub/shared/JMR_pub_affyannot.html. Flow Cytometry—Approximately 5 × 105 trypsinized keratinocytes were fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing in cold PBS, we stained the cells with 37.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml RNase (Ambion); cells were analyzed with FACScan (BD Biosciences). The immediate effects of TNFα cause the activation of transcription factors, including NFκB. As expected (24Komine M. Rao L.S. Kaneko T. Tomic-Canic M. Tamaki K. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32077-32088Google Scholar), the activation of NFκB leads to its nuclear translocation (Fig. 1, A and B). The consequent transcriptional induction of the NFκB-responsive genes results in profound morphological changes: the regular, polygonal “cobblestone” appearance of untreated keratinocytes is replaced by uneven arrangement, prominent cell-cell boundaries, and irregularly shaped cells 48 h after the TNFα treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). Few cells showed degenerative structures indicating cell death. Microarray Data Mining—To obtain a comprehensive picture of the transcriptional changes caused by TNFα, we grew primary cultures of untransformed, normal human epidermal keratinocytes and treated them with 50 ng/ml of TNFα, which was followed by RNA isolation for microarray experiments. Of the ∼12,000 genes present on the chips, some 7,300 were found expressed in keratinocytes; of these, some 230 genes were regulated by TNFα, according to our criteria. Of the 230 genes, 183 were induced (80%), 43 were suppressed, and 4 were both up-regulated and down-regulated at different time points. We used several well established data mining tools to analyze the microarray data. The scatter plots (in Fig. 2, A and B) representing log-transformed expression values of TNFα-treated keratinocytes (ordinate) versus untreated corresponding controls (abscissa) show the distribution of expressed genes during the experiment, and indicate that the number of regulated genes increased with the time lapsed. TNFα works quickly: more than 30 genes were induced at 1 h. Another feature of TNFα regulation is that the number of induced genes is always much larger than that of the suppressed ones. In this, TNFα is quite different from e.g. interferon-γ or UV light, which induce and suppress roughly equal numbers of genes (22Li D. Turi T.G. Schuck A. Freedberg I.M. Khitrov G. Blumenberg M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 2533-2535Google Scholar, 23Banno T. Adachi M. Mukkamala L. Blumenberg M. Antivir. Ther. 2003; 8: 650-664Google Scholar). Using a clustering algorithm, we compared the regulated genes at each time point after TNFα stimulation and found that the 24 and 48 h time points were very similar to each other, forming a “late wave” of regulated genes and suggesting a prolonged and sustained effect of TNFα (Fig. 2C). We compiled lists of all regulated genes at each time point and estimated the statistical probability, lod scores, that these lists contain overlapping genes. The matrix of lod scores indicates a significant overlap of the induced genes at all four time points and, similarly, an overlap of the repressed genes (Fig. 2D). Particularly similar are the lists of genes regulated at the 24- and 48-h time points, confirming the existence of the late wave. To confirm independently the array results, we performed Northern blot analysis of eight representative genes (Fig. 3). We chose both up- and down-regulated genes and both early- and late-regulated ones. To our satisfaction, all of the genes tested showed equivalent regulation in the two methods. Functional Characterization of the TNFα-regulated Genes—To understand the cellular processes affected in keratinocytes by TNFα stimulation, we arranged the regulated genes in a hierarchical table of their cellular functions (Fig. 4). The first level of hierarchy indicates the major function or category of each gene; the second integrates these functions into cellular tasks or activities; and the third assigns them to a global process affected by TNFα. Below, we focus on the specific sets of TNFα-regulated genes, those that are involved in the innate immunity, inflammation, tissue repair and remodeling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, epidermal differentiation, cell-cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Innate Immunity and Inflammation—Because TNFα is well known to be an activator of innate immunity and inflammation in skin (9Wakefield P.E. James W.D. Samlaska C.P. Meltzer M.S. J. Am. Acad. Dermatol. 1991; 24: 675-685Google Scholar, 16Kondo S. Sauder D.N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1713-1718Google Scholar), those effects will not be described in great detail here. TNFα induces members of its own family (TNFα, LTB), the TGF-β family (INHBA, BMP2), angiogenic cytokines (ECGF1, VEGFC, EFNA1), and others (NK4, TGFA, SEMA3C, BST2). The IL-8 family proteins (GRO1, GRO2, GRO3, and IL-8) have a potential for attracting the neutrophils, chemokines CXCL10, CXCL11, CCL5, and CCL20 attract monocytes and macrophages, whereas CCL27 attracts the skin-associate memory T-cells. TNFα induced chemokine receptor (HM74), interleukin receptors and their antagonists (IL-4R, OSMR, and IL-1RN), interferon receptors (IFNAR2, IFNGR2), and ICAM-1. Importantly, TNFα also induced antigen-processing proteases (PSMB9, PSMB10, PSME2), a putative antigen transporter (ABCB2), and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC1) antigens, which permits effective antigen presentation on keratinocytes. Complement components (BF) and enzymes of arachidonic acid metabolism (ALOX15B) and endopeptidase (ADAM8) were also induced. Taken together, these results suggest that TNFα induces chemokines, cytokines, growth factors, and cell-surface receptors that could in vivo invite hematopoietic cells, neutrophils, memory T cells, monocytes, and macrophages, all of which contribute to the innate immunity and inflammation. Effects upon Tissue Remodeling, Cytoskeleton, and Cell Migration—The effects of TNFα upon tissue remodeling, cytoskeleton, and cell migration have not been extensively studied. The reconstruction of the extracellular matrix (ECM) might be an important factor for tissue repair during and after inflammation. The induction of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 was particularly dramatic (see Fig. 3). MMP9 is the major gelatinase able to degrade collagen IV, and it is actively involved in tissue degradation, wound healing, and tumor metastasis (25Brinckerhoff C.E. Matrisian L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 207-214Google Scholar). Surprisingly, it appears that MMP inhibitor TIMP3 was suppressed by TNFα, which could result in a synergistic facilitation of tissue degradation by the MMPs in vivo. In addition, the induction of laminins LAMA3, LAMB3, and LAMC2, as well as HSPG2, a major heparan sulfate proteoglycan of basement membranes with adhesive and growth regulatory properties, strongly suggests an in vivo role for TNFα in the production of basement membrane (26Murdoch A.D. Dodge G.R. Cohen I. Tuan R.S. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8544-8557Google Scholar). Fibril-associated collagen 16A1 and mucin-related membrane protein TIA-2 were also induced by TNFα. TNFα regulates the coagulation system through the induction of plasminogen activator and its receptor (PLAU, PLAUR) and serum amyloid A (SAA1). TNFα induced both adhesion and cytoskeleton-associated proteins in keratinocytes, suggesting a characteristic regulation of cell attachment and migration. Specifically, certain integrins (ITGA5, ITGAV, and ITGB6) and actin-related genes (EFNA1, CEP4, MLP, NCK1, and ARHE) were highly regulated by TNFα. Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate the dynamic linkages between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix, as well as transduce signals to and from the cell interior (27Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Additionally, TNFα induced several adhesion molecules (NINJ1, HXB, and HEF1). This is the first report of NINJ1 induction by TNFα; this induction peaks at 4 h after TNFα stimulation, indicating a rapid regulation (also shown in Fig. 3). Interestingly, TNFα induced many proteinase inhibitors (HE4, CST6, PI3, SLPI, SPINK5, SERPINB1, SERPINB8, SERPINB2, SERPINB3), perhaps to protect keratinocytes from excess inflammation. Additional proteinase inhibitors, such as SPINK5, may have a role in epidermal barrier function (28Chavanas S. Bodemer C. Rochat A. Hamel-Teillac D. Ali M. Irvine A.D. Bonafe J.L. Wilkinson J. Taieb A. Barrandon Y. Harper J.I. de Prost Y. Hovnanian A. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 141-142Google Scholar) and protease inhibitor 3 (PI3) is an epithelial host-defense protein against microbial infections (29Sallenave J.M. Cunningham G.A. James R.M. McLachlan G. Haslett C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 3766-3774Google Scholar). Taken together, these TNFα-induced changes in expression of integrins, adhesion molecules, and actin-related genes imply profound changes of the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, we found major differences in the actin skeleton: in the treated cells, actin filaments assembled into perinuclear cages and extended into filopodia and lamellipodia. In contrast to the tight packing of control keratinocytes, the TNFα-treated ones withdrew from their neighbors and spread out (Fig. 5A). We expected that the cytoskeletal changes caused by TNFα would affect cell behavior, in particular, cell migration and cell-cell interactions. To examine the effect of TNFα on keratinocyte migration, we performed real-time recording of cell cultures. Fig. 5B shows the comparison of the growing pattern of keratinocyte cultures with or without TNFα. Whereas the untreated keratinocytes simply fill out the empty spaces, the TNFα-treated keratinocytes extensively migrate and completely change the shapes of the empty spaces by moving in and out of them. This suggests that TNFα stimulates the motility of keratinocytes. We traced the migration of keratinocytes using images from real-time recordings of cultured keratinocytes during the 8 h after TNFα treatment. We found that the TNFα-treated keratinocytes migrate much more than the untreated ones, they move in random directions, and they form many short-lived cell-to-cell contacts (Fig. 5C). Therefore, the TNFα-induced changes of expression of cytoskeleton-associated proteins significantly enhance keratinocyte motility, an essential component of the wound-healing process not previously associated with TNFα. Control of Cell Growth and Cell Death—Because TNFα only mildly affects the cell proliferation rate in culture (see below), its effects upon growth and apoptosis have remained largely unknown. However, our data clearly show that TNFα profoundly affects these processes. TNFα specifically affects the cell cycle of keratinocytes. The G0/G1 switch gene (G0S2), G1/S block genes (BTG2, BTG3), and GADD45A were induced, whereas the proliferation-associated proteins (CDC25C, RRM2, MCM3) were suppressed. This suggests that TNFα may maintain the keratinocyte cell-cycle in the G1 phase. We confirmed the inhibitory effect of TNFα on cell proliferation by measuring it directly (Fig. 6A) and performing fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis, which demonstrated a significant depletion of the cells in the S phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 6B). TNFα induces cell death in some tumor cell lines (30Sugarman B.J. Aggarwal B.B. Hass P.E. Figari I.S. Palladino Jr., M.A. Shepard H.M. Science. 1985; 230: 943-945Google Scholar); however, our cultures did not show prominent cell death after the TNFα treatment. Microarray analysis revealed that TNFα induced both pro-apoptotic (TNFSF10, BIK, BID) and anti-apoptotic genes (TRAF1, CFLAR, BIRC3, PSEN1"

Cholesterol oxidation is mediated by the enzymes cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Immunocytochemical studies show that CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 are expressed in neurons and some astrocytes in the normal brain, and CYP27A1 is present in oligodendrocytes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), CYP46A1 shows prominent expression in astrocytes and around amyloid plaques, whereas CYP27A1 expression decreases in neurons and is not apparent around amyloid plaques but increases in oligodendrocytes. Although previous studies have examined the effects of synthetic oxysterols on the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), the actions of the naturally occurring oxysterols have yet to be examined. To understand the role of cholesterol oxidation in AD, we compared the effects of 24(S)- and 27-hydroxycholesterol on the processing of APP and analyzed the cell-specific expression patterns of the two cholesterol hydroxylases in the human brain. Both oxysterols inhibited production of Aβ in neurons, but 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol was ∼1000-fold more potent than 27-hydroxycholesterol. The IC50 of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol for inhibiting Aβ secretion was ∼1 nm. Both oxysterols induced ABCA1 expression with IC50 values similar to that for inhibition of A β secretion, suggesting the involvement of liver X receptor. Oxysterols also inhibited protein kinase C activity and APP secretion following stimulation of protein kinase C. The selective expression of CYP46A1 around neuritic plaques and the potent inhibition of APP processing in neurons by 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol suggests that CYP46A1 affects the pathophysiology of AD and provides insight into how polymorphisms in the CYP46A1 gene might influence the pathophysiology of this prevalent disease.

Coleman P.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The neurodegeneration that occurs in AD is associated with restructuring of the neuropil. Degenerating neurons retract their processes and reduce the number of synapses (1Callahan L.M. Coleman P.D. Neurobiol. Aging. 1995; 16: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neurons with reduced arborization have less surface area and correspondingly less plasma membrane. Cholesterol is the major sterol present in the plasma membrane. Because cholesterol is so abundant, the synaptic degeneration occurring in AD requires that neuron dispose of the excess cholesterol. Cholesterol is catabolized through three main routes. Cholesterol can be esterified and stored within neurons as cholesterol esters (2Russell D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cholesterol can be oxidized at the 24 or 27 position to form 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-OHC) or 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC), which are termed oxysterols (2Russell D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 3Javitt N.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 1147-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both oxysterols are more soluble than cholesterol and are excreted from cells to associate with lipoprotein particles in serum or extracellular fluid. Oxysterols serve a dual function because they are both cholesterol catabolites and ligands of the nuclear transcription factor LXR (4Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Oliver B.B. Su J.L. Sundseth S.S. Winegar D.A. Blanchard D.E. Spencer T.A. Willson T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3137-3140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). The oxysterols are particularly intriguing because cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1), one of the enzymes that oxidizes cholesterol, is largely brain-specific, whereas the other enzyme, cholesterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), is expressed more broadly (5Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Multiple studies indicate that levels of 24-OHC increase in plasma of patients with neurodegenerative illness, including AD (6Lutjohann D. Papassotiropoulos A. Bjorkhem I. Locatelli S. Bagli M.

Res. 2002; 36: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); however, it is unclear whether increases in 24-OHC affect the pathophysiology or modulate APP metabolism. Recent studies show that the processing of APP is sensitive to cholesterol levels. Cleavage of APP by β- and γ-secretases produces Aβ. These cleavage events take place in the high cholesterol environments of lipid raft domains. Reducing cholesterol levels inhibits Aβ production and increases secretion of APP (9Simons M. Keller P.

The dependence of Aβ production on cholesterol has generally been explained by localization of β- and γ-secretases to lipid rafts (12Burns M. Gaynor K. Olm V. Mercken M. LaFrancois J. Wang L.

Dis. 2002; 9: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The relationship between Aβ and cholesterol has led to speculation that statins, a type of medicine that lowers cholesterol, might reduce Aβ production and be useful as a therapeutic agent for AD (16Wolozin B.

Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar). Cholesterol catabolites also modulate Aβ production. Cholesterol esters increase Aβ production, and inhibiting the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase that synthesizes these enzymes reduces Aβ production (18Puglielli L. Konopka G.

In contrast, recent studies show that the synthetic oxysterol 22-hydroxycholesterol inhibits Aβ production in some neuroblastoma cell lines (19Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J.

Understanding how production of 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol affects APP metabolism has taken on particular relevance because of two reports suggesting that polymorphisms in CYP46A1 are associated with an increased load of Aβ or earlier onset of AD (21Kolsch H. Lutjohann D. Ludwig M. Schulte A. Ptok U. Jessen F. von Bergmann K. Rao M.L. Maier W. Heun R. Mol. Psychiatry. 2002; 7: 899-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 22Papassotiropoulos A.

Arch. Neurol. 2003; 60: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the present study we compared the expression of CYP24 with CYP27A1 in the brains of patients with AD and age-matched controls. We also examined how the oxysterol products of these two enzymes, 24-OHC and 27-OHC, affect APP processing in primary neurons. We observed that the distribution of both enzymes change in the brains of subjects with AD. CYP46A1 is selectively expressed in degenerating neurites around senile plaques, whereas CYP27A1 expression is increased in white matter oligodendrocytes. We showed that 24- and 27-OHC inhibit Aβ production and protein kinase C (PKC)-stimulated APP secretion, but 24-OHC is more potent that 27-OHC. Inhibition of APP secretion can be explained by indirect inhibition of PKC activity in neurons, which suggests a role for 24-OHC in signal transduction. Tissue—Cortical tissue (fixed and frozen) was obtained from seven subjects with AD (mean age 77.0 ± 2.2 years, mean post-mortem interval 16.9 ± 6.0 h) and seven normal subjects (mean age 73.3 ± 3.1 years, mean post-mortem interval 6.3 ± 2.4 h). The tissue was obtained from the Loyola University Medical Center Brain Bank. All AD subjects had moderate to severe dementia. Primary Cortical Neurons—Neurons were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rat pups (E18), cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated 75-cm2 flasks using 9 million cells/flask, and plated with neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen), which contains retinoic acid. At day 3, the neurons were treated with 50 μm araC. After 24 h the medium was removed, and fresh medium containing neurobasal, B27 supplement, and 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Six days after plating, the cells were treated with APP adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 10) for 6 h (23Yuan H. Zhai P. Anderson L.M. Pan J. Thimmapaya B. Koo E.H. Marquez-Sterling N.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The next day, cells were treated with an oxysterol in fresh medium consisting of neurobasal, B27 supplement, and 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Medium was collected for measuring Aβ. The cells were then incubated in fresh serum-free neurobasal/B27 medium containing oxysterol. After 1 h, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free neurobasal/B27 medium containing oxysterol for 1 h, and the medium from this second incubation was collected to measure basal APP secretion. The neurons were then incubated in fresh serum-free neurobasal/B27 medium containing oxysterol with and without 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 1 h, and the medium was again collected. Secreted APP was concentrated from the medium samples by heparin-agarose immunoprecipitation, and APP was analyzed by immunoblot (24Palacino J. Berechid B. Alexander P. Eckman C. Younkin S. Nye J. Wolozin B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 215-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were collected, APP in the lysates was analyzed by immunoblot, and PKC was assayed as described below. For analysis of ABCA1, the neurons were lysed in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), plus protease inhibitors. After quantification of protein by BCA assay, the lysates were incubated in SDS loading buffer for 30 min, separated by electrophoresis on a SDS-6% polyacrylamide gel, and then immunoblotted (25Fukumoto H.

Adenoviral Treatment—Adenoviral expression of APP was achieved by infecting neurons at a multiplicity of infection of 10 as described previously (23Yuan H. Zhai P. Anderson L.M. Pan J. Thimmapaya B.

Antibodies—Antibodies 3046 and 3047 were rabbit polyclonal antibodies produced against amino acids 226–242 of human CYP46A1. The third CYP46A1 antibody, T623, was produced against amino acids 254–270 of murine Cyp46A1 and has been described previously (5Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Anti-CYP27A1 antibody recognizes amino acids 15–28 of mature CYP27A1 and is similar to one described previously by Cali and Russell (26Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LN27, a monoclonal antibody directed against the N terminus of APP, was used to detect APPs (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Holo-APP and C-terminal fragments were detected using antibody 0443, as described previously (27Marlow L. Cain M. Pappolla M.A. Sambamurti K. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2003; 20: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). ABCA1 was detected with rabbit anti-ABCA1 (1:1000, Novus). Immunocytochemistry—Free-floating fixed 40-μm tissue sections were used for immunocytochemistry. The samples were washed, permeabilized by incubation for 30 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% dry milk, 1% goat serum, and phosphate-buffered saline, washed, incubated overnight in primary antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and phosphate-buffered saline, washed, incubated for 3 h in secondary antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, and phosphate-buffered saline, washed, and then cover-slipped. Immunoblotting—Transfers to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) were carried out overnight at 4 °C at 0.05 amps/gel in transfer buffer. The immunoblot was blocked in 0.2% I-block (Tropix) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature with shaking. We then incubated blots overnight at 4 °C in primary antibody at appropriate the concentration in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. Blots were then washed three times for 10 min each and incubated for 3 h in secondary antibody (1:5000, Jackson Laboratories) in I-block at room temperature. Blots were washed three times and developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Thioflavine T Staining—Following the immunocytochemical treatment, sections were incubated with 0.5% thioflavine T for 8 min, washed three times in 80% ethanol, washed once in H2O, and then mounted. Aβ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—Secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels were analyzed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system as described previously using the following antibodies: Aβ40, MM27 33.1.1 capture, MM32 13.1.1 for detection; Aβ42, MM27 33.1.1 capture, MM26 4.1.3 for detection (28Suzuki N.

PKC Assay—PKC activity was measured by monitoring the phosphorylation of a PKC substrate peptide (QKRPSQRSKYL) using a PKC assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Lysates from brain or cortical neurons were harvested in PKC lysis buffer (150 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 50 mm Tris HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, plus 0.02 V protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma)). Reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylserine, 0.5 mg/ml diacylglycerol, and 30–100 μg of sample. 10 μl of an Mg2+/ATP mixture (75 mm magnesium chloride, 500 μm ATP, 1–2 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol)) was added to start the reaction. Twenty microliters of reaction mixture were spotted onto a 1-cm square of phosphocellulose P-81 paper at the end of the incubation period. The squares were washed five times with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once in acetone and counted for radioactivity. Samples containing no substrates were included in every experiment to determine basal levels of radioactivity, and the basal radioactivity was subtracted from the experimental counts. Statistics—All results are presented as mean ± S.E. When analysis of variance showed significant differences, pairwise comparisons between the means are analyzed by Newman-Keuls post-hoc testing. IC50 values were calculated using the Prism program (GraphPad). Production of Antibodies to CYP46A1—The ability of oxysterols to modulate APP processing suggests that their pattern of expression in the brain in AD could influence production of Aβ. To explore this issue, we used immunochemistry to analyze the expression patterns of CYP46A1 and CYP27A1, which produce 24- and 27-OHC, respectively. We used three different antibodies. Antibodies 3046 and 3047 were generated against amino acids 226–242 of human CYP46A1. Both antibodies identified CYP46A1 by immunoblotting (Fig. 1, A and B). Antibodies 3046 and 3047 both recognized the 70-kDa band characteristic of CYP46A1. Preadsorption of both antibodies with the immunizing peptide eliminated all reactivity (Fig. 1D). A third antibody, which was produced against amino acids 254–270 of murine CYP46A1, gave a similar banding pattern (Fig. 1C) (5Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry of CYP46A1 and Expression in Neurons, Astrocytes, and Senile Plaques—Next, we examined the distributions of CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 in human frontal cortex from donors without neurological disease. Antibody 3047 gave the least background staining. CYP46A1 expression was detected in pyramidal neurons (Fig. 2A) as well as in occasional astrocytes (Fig. 2B). No staining was observed with preimmune serum (Fig. 2D). The relative amount of expression in astrocytes and neurons did not show a correlation with post-mortem interval, sex, or age, although a larger sample size would be required to obtain definitive statistical information on this question. Staining with the anti-CYP46A1 antibody also showed reactivity in neurons and astrocytes in frontal cortex tissue from an AD brain, with more neurons evident in tissue from neurologically normal samples (Fig. 2E). The striking feature of CYP46A1 staining in the Alzheimer brain tissue was the presence of CYP46A1 among neuritic plaques (Fig. 2C). Staining of neurons and astrocytes in AD cortex was similar to that seen in normal cortex, although the number of neurons expressing CYP46A1 was decreased, possibly because of disease-related neuronal loss (Fig. 2E). Preadsorption removed staining of CYP46A1 in neurons, astrocytes, and neuritic plaques (data not shown). To determine whether CYP46A1 staining localized to the amyloid core or the neuritic periphery, we performed double staining with thioflavine T (Fig. 3). Double staining with thioflavine T and anti-CYP46A1 antibody 3047 showed that CYP46A1 reactivity was present in over 90% of the plaques identifiable by thioflavine T (Fig. 3). The CYP46A1 reactivity was present in the periphery of neuritic plaques but did not co-localize with the amyloid core, suggesting that the CYP46A1 was not directly associated with compact, aggregated Aβ (Fig. 3). The peripheral staining around neuritic plaques was consistent with staining in degenerating neurites. In contrast to the strong concordance between thioflavine staining and CYP46A1 staining, we did not observe CYP46A1 staining in any tangles that were thioflavine-positive (data not shown). A similar pattern of reactivity was observed for anti-CYP46A1 antibody 3046 (data not shown).Fig. 3CYP46A1 is located in and around the amyloid core of neuritic plaques.A, immunocytochemical staining of CYP46A1 (red) in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer tissue identifies neuritic plaques. B, thioflavine T (green) staining identifies neuritic plaques and exhibits intense reactivity in the amyloid core. C, merging panels A and B shows that CYP46A1 (red) reactivity is located around the amyloid core (green), suggesting that the enzyme is present in the neuritic periphery of the plaque. Bar, 30 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we examined the pattern of CYP27A1 expression. The protein CYP27A1 was analyzed using an anti-CYP27A1 antibody recognizing amino acids 15–28 of mature CYP27A1, similar to one described previously by Cali and Russell (26Cali J.J. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the normal cortex, CYP27A1 was present in many neurons where it showed strong reactivity in both the soma and proximal dendrites (Fig. 4A). Little staining of CYP27A1 was observed in the white matter of normal brain (Fig. 4B). The pattern of CYP27A1 staining in the AD brain differed from that in normal brain. Neuronal staining with anti-CYP27A1 antibody was greatly reduced (Fig. 4, C and E). In contrast, there was a large increase of staining in the white matter of the AD brain (Fig. 4, D and E). The CYP27A1 reactivity present in the white matter occurred in the soma of small round cells, the morphology that is classic for oligodendrocytes (Fig. 4D). In the AD brain, quantification showed a 66% (p < 0.05) reduction in the number of cortical neurons identified per high power field and a 4.6-fold (p < 0.01) increase in the number of oligodendrocytes identified per high power field (Fig. 4E). The staining did not show a correlation with post-mortem interval, sex, or age, although a larger sample size would be required to obtain definitive statistical information on this question. Quantification of CYP46A1 Levels in AD and Normal Brains—Immunocytochemical studies show that CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 proteins are present in multiple cell types in the AD and normal brain. To understand how the complex changes in expression affect the total expression of each protein, we performed immunoblots on cortical tissue from normal and AD brain. The CYP46A1 reactivity was apparent as a band at 70 kDa (Fig. 5A, arrow). There was a large variation in the total expression of CYP46A1 among the brains. Although quantification of band intensities showed a modest increase in staining in the AD brain, the increase was not statistically significant (normalized OD: control, 0.17 ± 0.15; AD, 0.34 ± 0.20; n = 7 each, p = 0.094). The CYP27A1 reactivity was apparent as a band at 47 kDa (Fig. 5B, arrow). CYP27A1 band intensity also showed variation among subjects, which resulted in no significant change in band intensity in AD brain samples (normalized OD: control, 0.35 ± 0.21; AD, 0.21 ± 0.11; n = 7 each, p = 0.13). The absence of disease-related differences in total CYP46A1 and CYP27A1 detected by immunoblot might occur because the decreased neuronal staining balances the increased staining in neuritic plaques (CYP46A1) or oligodendrocytes (CYP27A1). 24-OHC Inhibits APP Processing in Cortical Neurons Grown in Primary Cultures—Recent studies show that the synthetic oxysterol 22-OHC inhibits Aβ secretion in cell lines, but the modulation of APP processing by the natural oxysterols 24- and 27-OHC has yet to be investigated (19Koldamova R.P. Lefterov I.M. Ikonomovic M.D. Skoko J. Lefterov P.I. Isanski B.A. DeKosky S.T. Lazo J.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27688-27694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, modulation of APP processing by oxysterols in primary cultures of neurons also has not been investigated. To allow detection of Aβ, cortical neurons were infected with adenovirus, driving the expression of human APP (23Yuan H. Zhai P. Anderson L.M. Pan J. Thimmapaya B. Koo E.H. Marquez-Sterling N.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1999; 88: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Two days later, the neurons were treated with 10 μm 24-OHC for up to 24 h to determine whether oxysterols exerted rapid or delayed actions on Aβ or APP secretion. At this point, medium was collected for Aβ and APP analysis. We observed that 24-OHC inhibited both Aβ secretion and PMA-stimulated APP secretion (Fig. 6, A and B). 24-OHC showed slightly stronger inhibition of Aβ and APP secretion after 24 h than after 6 h (Fig. 6A). By 24 h, 24-OHC inhibited Aβ secretion by up to 68.5 ± 1.6% (p < 0.001) and APP secretion by over 65% (at 6 h, 68.3 ± 14.9% inhibition, p < 0.05; at 24 h, 87.1 ± 10.4 inhibition, p < 0.005) (Fig. 6, A and B). No changes were observed in steady state levels of cellular APP, although the levels of α-C-terminal fragments were decreased in the presence of 24-OHC, suggesting that the changes in APP processing are the result of decreased cleavage of APP by secretases (Fig. 6C). Next we examined the dose-response relationship of 24-OHC after 24 h treatment. 24-OHC inhibited secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42, with an IC50 of ∼7 nm, based on a plateau for inhibition at 40% control values (Fig. 6, D and E). 24-OHC also prevented PKC from stimulating APP secretion, exhibiting an IC50 for the inhibition of APP secretion similar to that observed for the inhibition of Aβ secretion (Fig. 6F). To determine whether the changes in APP processing correlated with LXR activity, we analyzed the expression of ABCA1, which is induced by LXR activity. Primary neurons were treated with 24-OHC as described above, and then ABCA1 expression in the lysates was determined by immunoblot. Expression of ABCA1 was stimulated by treatment with 1 μm 24-OHC, consistent with LXR activation (Fig. 6G). Finally, we investigated whether 24-OHC was causing toxicity in the neuronal cultures, because toxicity could reduce Aβ secretion. Analysis of toxicity by an assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide showed no evidence of neurotoxicity over 24 h of OHC treatment at doses below 5 μm 24-OHC (data not shown). These data indicate that 24-OHC inhibits both Aβ and APP secretion and that the inhibition is accompanied by LXR activation. 27-OHC Inhibits Aβ and APPs Secretion—Next we examined the effects of 27-OHC on APP processing. We observed that 27-OHC also inhibited APP processing, although with lower potency. Cortical neurons grown in primary culture were exposed for 24 h to 1–15 μm 27-OHC. The medium and cellular lysates were then collected, and APP processing was examined. 27-OHC inhibited secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 with an IC50 of ∼2 μm, based on a plateau for inhibition at 62% of control values (Figs. 6, A and D, and 7A). 27-OHC also inhibited PKC stimulated APP secretion (Fig. 7C). Immunoblots of the lysates with anti-ABCA1 antibody indicated that the induction of ABCA1 paralleled the inhibition of APP processing (Fig. 7D). This suggests that the inhibition of Aβ by 27-OHC was less potent than th"

Previously, we have found that of the three ligands, CXCL11 is the most potent inducer of CXCR3 internalization and is the physiologic inducer of CXCR3 internalization after T cell contact with activated endothelial cells. We have therefore hypothesized that these three ligands transduce different signals to CXCR3. In light of this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether regions of CXCR3 are differentially required for CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 function. Here we identified two distinct domains that contributed to CXCR3 internalization. The carboxyl-terminal domain and β-arrestin1 were predominantly required by CXCL9 and CXCL10, and the third intracellular loop was predominantly required by CXCL11. Chemotaxis and calcium mobilization induced by all three CXCR3 ligands were dependent on the CXCR3 carboxyl terminus and the DRY sequence in the third trans-membrane domain. Our findings demonstrate that distinct domains of CXCR3 mediate its functions and suggest that the differential requirement of these domains contributes to the complexity of the chemokine system.

Chemokines, or chemoattractant cytokines, are a family of small (8–10 kDa) proteins that play an important role in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). By inducing the migration of leukocytes, they play a critical role in innate immunity as well as the development of an adaptive immune response and the maintenance of chronic inflammation. Chemokines induce their biological effects by binding to seven trans-membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; PBS, phosphate buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Erk, extracellular signal-related protein kinase; PE, phycoerythrin. (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3272) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 chemokines have been described that interact with ∼16 GPCR chemokine receptors, implying that there is redundancy in the chemokine system. However, this apparent redundancy has not been supported by in vivo studies that have instead demonstrated that individual chemokines that activate the same receptor can have unique functions in vivo (2Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). This may be related to differential chemokine expression in vivo and/or differential receptor activation by different chemokine ligands (3Elsner J. Mack M. Bruhl H. Dulkys Y. Kimmig D. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Schlondorff D. Kapp A. Wells T.N. Proudfoot A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7787-7794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). CXCR3 is expressed on the surface of a number of cell types, including activated T cells and NK cells, and subsets of inflammatory dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells (4Loetscher M. Gerber B.

Investig. 1998; 101: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). CXCR3 is a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptor, indicating that it is coupled to the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins (7Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Activation of chemokine receptors has been reported to induce a number of signaling pathways as well as the activation of integrins, G protein-related kinases, and the binding of β-arrestin (8Aramori I.

The down-regulation of response for a receptor is important in its overall function. Chemokine receptors are down-regulated in at least two ways. The most rapid way is the uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein, which prevents further activation by ligand, a process referred to as desensitization (13Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors are also down-regulated by internalization, or endocytosis, a process that removes the receptor from the cell surface resulting in a more prolonged unresponsiveness to the ligand. The internalized receptor may be degraded in lysosomes or recycled back to the cell surface (14Moro O. Lameh J. Sadee W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6862-6865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it has been proposed recently (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 16Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J.

Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) that, following internalization, GPCR complexes can transduce unique signaling information. The internalization of many GPCRs, including at least two chemokine receptors, CXCR4 and CCR5, is mediated by the phosphorylation of carboxyl-terminal serine and threonine residues by the G protein-related kinases. This phosphorylation event induces β-arrestin2 binding to the cytoplasmic tail, which targets the receptor to clathrin-coated pits in a dynamin-dependent manner (8Aramori I. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Zhang J. Cullen B. Caron M.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4606-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Sun Y. Cheng Z. Ma L. Pei G. J. Biol.

S. A. 2002; 99: 7478-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been shown that chemokine receptors can be differentially activated by different ligands. For example, CXCL8 (interleukin-8) activation of CXCR2 results in higher levels of receptor internalization than CXCL7 (NAP2) (17Feniger-Barish R. Ran M. Zaslaver A. Ben-Baruch A. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether CXCL8 and CXCL7 induce CXCR2 internalization through different pathways or whether the effect is because of differences in ligand potency. Additionally, synthetic derivatives of CCL5 (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) can induce CCR5 internalization and can mobilize calcium but cannot activate chemotaxis (18Vila-Coro A.J. Mellado M. Martin de Ana A. Martinez A.C. Rodriguez-Frade J.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3037-3044PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the activation of a chemokine receptor by different ligands may lead to different signals. Three ligands are known to activate CXCR3-CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL9 (Mig), and CXCL11 (I-TAC) (4Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp.

Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Each of these ligands is induced by interferon-γ and is produced in Th1-type immune responses (19Cole K.E.

Although these three ligands are all induced by interferon-γ, they appear to mediate distinct biological phenomena in vivo (22Hancock W.W. Gao W. Csizmadia V. Faia K.L. Shemmeri N. Luster A.D. J.

Alternatively, the different biological outcomes may also be related to the differential activation of CXCR3 by CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11. In this regard, our previous work has shown that CXCL11 is the physiologic inducer of CXCR3 internalization following T cell contact with interferon-γ-activated endothelial cells, even though these cells produce greater amounts of CXCL10 and CXCL9 than CXCL11 (33Sauty A. Colvin R.A. Wagner L. Rochat S. Spertini F. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7084-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We also found that CXCL11 was the most potent inducer of CXCR3 internalization. Therefore, we speculated that these three ligands transduce different signals to CXCR3 (33Sauty A. Colvin R.A. Wagner L. Rochat S. Spertini F. Luster A.D. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 7084-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we mutated CXCR3 in the intracellular domains to determine whether CXCR3 is differentially activated by CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11. We specifically tested the effects of mutations on the receptor, including ligand binding, receptor phosphorylation, and receptor internalization; effects of the mutations on downstream signaling pathways, including Erk phosphorylation and calcium mobilization; and finally, the effects of the mutations on chemotaxis.

A cDNA encoding CXCR3 was inserted into the KpnI and EcoRI restriction sites in the multicloning site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The Tail(–)-CXCR3 truncation was constructed by amplifying the cDNA encoding CXCR3 with the appropriate primers. Point mutations were introduced into CXCR3 by using the Quikchange mutagenesis kit by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) and oligonucleotides encoding the specific changes. Chimeric genes encoding the bovine pre-prolactin signal sequence and the FLAG tag followed by CXCR3 were constructed by ligating the pre-prolactin-FLAG genes to CXCR3 at a SalI site. The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Tissue Culture—300-19 is a pre-B cell leukemia cell line known to functionally express chemokine receptors following stable transfection (34Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At base line, 300-19 cells functionally express CXCR4 allowing for a positive control in assays of chemokine function (34Arai H. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14495-14499Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 300-19 cells were cultured in RPMI (Cellgro and Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Mediatech) (complete RPMI). HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modification of minimal essential medium (Mediatech), with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Mediatech), and 2 mm l-glutamine (Mediatech). Stable Transfection—1 × 107 300-19 cells were incubated with 10 μg of linearized CXCR3/pcDNA3.1 constructs for 10 min on ice and electroporated using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 250 V and 975 microfarads in a 0.2-cm gap electrode cuvette (Bio-Rad). Following the electroporation, the cells were grown in complete RPMI for 24 h and then placed into complete RPMI plus 80 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech) for selection. Enrichment of CXCR3 or CXCR3 Mutant-expressing Cells—5 × 106 transfected cells were stained with 3 μl of CXCR3 antibody 1C6 conjugated to PE (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in 10% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C. The stained cells were washed and then incubated with microbeads coupled to an anti-PE antibody, and CXCR3-expressing cells were positively selected over a MACS LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) and cultured in complete RPMI without G418. Cell Surface Expression of CXCR3 and CXCR3 Mutants—Cultured cells were resuspended in 100 μl of flow cytometry buffer (PBS without calcium and magnesium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% sodium azide) and 10% goat serum. They were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The anti-CXCR3 antibody, 1C6, conjugated to PE (R & D Systems) was added to the cells, which were then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS and subsequently fixed by resuspension in PBS with 2% paraformaldehyde. Receptor cell surface expression was measured on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and the data were analyzed by using Cellquest (BD Biosciences) or FlowJo (San Carlos, CA). Receptor Binding Assays—Binding assays were performed as reported previously (35Campanella G.S. Lee E.M. Sun J. Luster A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17066-17074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, 400,000 wild-type or mutant CXCR3/300-19 cells were placed into 96-well tissue culture plates in a total volume of 150 μl of binding buffer (0.5% BSA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). 0.04 nm of 125I-labeled CXCL10 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or CXCL11 (Amersham Biosciences) and increasing amounts of unlabeled CXCL10 or CXCL11 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) were added to the cells and incubated for 90 min at room temperature with shaking. The cells were transferred to 96-well filter plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA) pre-soaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine and washed three times with 200 μl of binding buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. The plates were dried, and the radioactivity was measured after the addition of scintillation fluid in a Wallac Microbeta scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Receptor Internalization—Wild-type-CXCR3/300-19 or mutant CXCR3/300-19 cells (250, 000) were incubated with various concentrations of CXCL10, CXCL11, or CXCL9 for 15 or 30 min as indicated at 37 °C. At the end of the incubations, ice-cold flow cytometry buffer was added, and cells were analyzed for cell surface expression of CXCR3 using the PE-conjugated CXCR3 antibody 1C6 as above. Chemotaxis—Chemotaxis assays of 300-19 cells were performed in 96-well Neuroprobe chemotaxis chambers with 5 μm pore size polycarbonate membranes (Neuroprobe, Gaithersburg, MD). 31 μl of RPMI containing 1% BSA and chemokines were placed in the bottom chamber of the device per the manufacturer's directions. 25,000 cells were layered onto the top of the membrane in RPMI containing 1% BSA. The chambers were then incubated at 37 °C for 5 h. After washing the top of the filter with deionized water, the chambers were subjected to centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min. The filters were removed, and media were aspirated. The chambers were then frozen at –80 °C for at least 1 h. 20 μl of CyQuant dye mix (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to each well of the Neuroprobe chamber. Following a 2-h incubation period, the fluorescence was measured in a CytoFluor fluorescent plate reader (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For each experiment, a cellular titration curve was completed to make sure that the fluorescence reading was in the linear range of the CyQuant dye, and the background fluorescence was subtracted from the readings for each sample. The chemotactic index was determined by dividing the fluorescence at each chemokine concentration by the fluorescence when no chemokine was added. The CyQuant results have been compared favorably with direct counting of the migrated cells. Chemotaxis data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) allowing the comparison of the chemotactic curves rather than individual points. Calcium Flux—5 × 106 wild-type or mutant CXCR3/300-19 cells were resuspended in 2 ml of RPMI with 1% bovine serum albumin. 15 μl of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 2 ml of calcium flux buffer (145 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1mm NaHPO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, 0.8 mm MgCl2, and 22 mm glucose). Fluorescence readings were measured at 37 °C in a DeltaRAM fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ). Intracellular calcium concentrations were recorded as the excitation fluorescence intensity emitted at 510 nm in response to sequential excitation at 340 and 380 nm and are presented as the relative ratio of fluorescence at 340/380. Receptor Phosphorylation—HEK293 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1 with wild-type-CXCR3 or Tail(–)-CXCR3 that had been constructed to include a bovine pre-prolactin signal sequence followed by DNA sequences encoding the FLAG epitope tag. Forty eight hours following transfection, the media were changed to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 1% BSA. The cells were incubated for 10 min, and 150 mCi of 32Pi (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well. Cells were incubated for 3 h followed by stimulation by 100 nm CXCL10 or CXCL11. Extracts were made, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (36January B. Seibold A. Whaley B. Hipkin R.W. Lin D. Schonbrunn A. Barber R. Clark R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23871-23879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed in 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 4 mg/ml dodecyl-β-maltoside, 0.2 mg/ml cholesteryl hemisuccinate, plus protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors. Following lysis, extracts were cleared by centrifugation and pre-cleared using protein-G-Sepharose beads, and proteins were immunoprecipitated using M2-anti-FLAG antibody preconjugated to agarose beads (Sigma). Following overnight immunoprecipitation, beads were washed five times using radioimmunoassay precipitation (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried on a vacuum gel-drier and subsequently exposed to autoradiography film. Transient Transfection—HEK293 cells were plated onto 6-well tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified essential medium. When the cells were ∼50% confluent they were transfected with pcDNA3.1 with the indicated CXCR3 gene inserted using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's directions. Total transfected DNA was kept constant using pcDNA3.1 without an insert. Truncation of the Carboxyl Terminus—A mutant of CXCR3, called Tail(–)-CXCR3, was generated to determine the role of the carboxyl terminus in CXCR3 function (Table I). Eight amino acids of the predicted carboxyl terminus were retained in order to ensure surface expression, while removing any putative signaling elements. A population of 300-19 cells that stably and highly expressed Tail(–)-CXCR3 was positively selected. Tail(–)-CXCR3 was expressed on the cell surface of 300-19 cells at similar levels to wild-type-CXCR3 (Table II). This suggested that CXCR3 is unlikely to require palmitoylation of carboxyl-terminal cysteines to achieve cell surface expression as has been seen for CCR5 (37Blanpain C. Wittamer V. Vanderwinden J.M. Boom A. Renneboog B. Lee B. Le Poul E. El Asmar L. Govaerts C. Vassart G. Doms R.W. Parmentier M. J. Biol.

In our binding assays, we could not determine an IC50 value for Tail(–)-CXCR3/300-19 cells to CXCL10 and CXCL11 despite the detection of some chemokine binding in the absence of competitor (Table II). CXCL9 binding assays were not performed as there is no commercially available 125I-labeled preparation of this chemokine.Table IAmino acid sequences of CXCR3 and CXCR3 mutants studied1st intracellular loopWild-type-CXCR3SRRTALSSTDTFLS80A-CXCR3ARRTALSSTDTFLT83A-CXCR3SRRAALSSTDTFLT90A-CXCR3SRRTALSSTDAFL3rd trans-membrane domainWild-type-CXCR3AGALFNINFYAGALLLACISFDRYR149N-CXCR3AGALFNINFYAGALLLACISFDNY3rd intracellular loopWild-type-CXCR3SRGQRRLRAMRLI3-CXCR1-CXCR3RTLFKAHMGQKHRAMRC terminusWild-type-CXCR3VKFRERMWMLLLRLGCPNQRGLQRQPSSSRRDSSWSETSEASYSGLTail (-)-CXCR3VKFRERM–––––––––––––––––––-ST (-)-CXCR3VKFRERMWMLLLRLGCPNQRGLQRQPAAARRDAAWAE AAEAAYSGLL332A/L33A/L334A-CXCR3VKFRERMWMAAARLGCPNQRGLQRQPSSSRRDSSWSETSEASYSGL Open table in a new tab Table IIExpression and chemokine binding of CXCR3 and CXCR3 mutantsReceptorSurface expression on transfected 300-19 cellsCXCL10CXCL11IC50% Wild-type bindingIC50Wild-type bindingnm%nm%CXCR31000.062 ± 0.021000.5 ± 0.138100Tail (-)81 ± 10Not calculable18 ± 10.511.5 ± 7.730.3 ± 5ST (-)96 ± 280.024 ± 0.0150 ± 00.82 ± 0.4867 ± 2i3-CXCR1-CXCR3141 ± 310.133 ± 0.0590 ± 100.91 ± 0.0670 ± 10R149N60 ± 280.089 ± 0.0538 ± 17NDNDL332A/L33A/L334A78 ± 130.11 ± 0.0590 ± 100.79 ± 0.41100 ± 0 Open table in a new tab CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11 were tested for their ability to induce internalization of wild-type-CXCR3 and Tail(–)-CXCR3 (Fig. 1). The ability of CXCL10 and CXCL9 to induce internalization of Tail(–)-CXCR3 was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type-CXCR3 (p < 0.01). In contrast, CXCL11 induced internalization of Tail(–)-CXCR3 as efficiently as wild-type-CXCR3. In chemotaxis assays, Tail(–)-CXCR3/300-19 cells did not migrate to CXCL10 or CXCL9, and migration to CXCL11 was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1). Upon stimulation with CXCL10, CXCL9, or CXCL11 (10 nm), there was no evidence of calcium mobilization in Tail(–)-CXCR3/300-19 cells (Fig. 2) or Erk phosphorylation (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of CXCR3 was essential for CXCL10-, CXCL9-, and CXCL11-induced chemotaxis, calcium mobilization, and Erk phosphorylation but was not essential for CXCL11-induced receptor internalization.Fig. 2Calcium mobilization assays of CXCR3 and CXCR3 mutants. The top row contains the calcium mobilization plots for wild-type-CXCR3/300-19 cells loaded with Fura-2 and activated with 10 nm CXCL10, CXCL9, or CXCL11 as indicated. The curves show the ratio of the 510-nm emissions after activation at 340 and 380 nm. Subsequent rows contain the calcium mobilization plots of the mutant-CXCR3/300-19 cells as indicated to the same treatments. The plots are representative of at least three experiments and are all shown on the same scale.

Upon receptor activation, these carboxyl-terminal serines and threonines are phosphorylated by G protein-related kinases, which allow β-arrestin binding and can lead to both G protein uncoupling and internalization by targeting receptors to clathrin-coated pits (8Aramori I.

Wild-type-CXCR3 and Tail(–)-CXCR3 were immunoprecipitated from extracts made from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged versions of these receptors (Fig. 3). Forty eight hours after transfection, the cells were metabolically labeled with 32PI and stimulated with 100 nm CXCL10 or CXCL11. A low level of base-line phosphorylation was seen in three of five experiments for wild-type-CXCR3. Wild-type-CXCR3 phosphorylation was enhanced after 5 min of stimulation by CXCL10 and CXCL11. However, neither CXCL10 nor CXCL11 stimulation enhanced the phosphorylation of Tail(–)-CXCR3, and constitutive phosphorylation of Tail(–)-CXCR3 was not seen. Five weeks after exposure to film there were no bands present at the appropriate size in lanes from extracts of Tail(–)-CXCR3/300-19 cells or untransfected 300-19 cells either before or after stimulation with CXCL10 or CXCL11. To determine whether the phosphorylated protein was CXCR3, Western blots were performed using the anti-CXCR3 antibody 1C6.

https://openalex.org/W2118061802,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is a multistep process dependent on β-cell metabolic flux. Our previous studies on intact pancreatic islets used two-photon NAD(P)H imaging as a quantitative measure of the combined redox signal from NADH and NADPH (referred to as NAD(P)H). These studies showed that pyruvate, a non-secretagogue, enters β-cells and causes a transient rise in NAD(P)H. To further characterize the metabolic fate of pyruvate, we have now developed one-photon flavoprotein microscopy as a simultaneous assay of lipoamide dehydrogenase (LipDH) autofluorescence. This flavoprotein is in direct equilibrium with mitochondrial NADH. Hence, a comparison of LipDH and NAD(P)H autofluorescence provides a method to distinguish the production of NADH, NADPH, or both. Using this method, the glucose dose response is consistent with an increase in both NADH and NADPH. In contrast, the transient rise in NAD(P)H observed with pyruvate stimulation is not accompanied by a significant change in LipDH, which indicates that pyruvate raises cellular NADPH without raising NADH. In comparison, methyl pyruvate stimulated a robust NADH and NADPH response. These data provide new evidence that exogenous pyruvate does not induce a significant rise in mitochondrial NADH. This inability likely results in its failure to produce the ATP necessary for stimulated secretion of insulin. Overall, these data are consistent with either a restricted pyruvate dehydrogenase-dependent metabolism or a buffering of the NADH response by other metabolic mechanisms.

The redox potential of β-cells increases in response to a rise in extracellular glucose. This redox response can be assayed using two-photon excitation NAD(P)H microscopy (1Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L.

McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Google Scholar). The NADPH generated has been proposed to modulate the ATP-dependent response directly (5MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Google Scholar) and provide information on the build-up of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates that modulate the ATP-dependent response (6Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C.

Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Google Scholar). Separately measuring the pyruvate-stimulated NADH and NADPH responses will provide insight into the inability of this metabolite to cause insulin secretion. Pyruvate produced from glycolysis enters β-cell mitochondrial metabolism nearly equally through pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and pyruvate carboxylase (PC) (8MacDonald M.J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1229-1231Google Scholar, 9Khan A. Ling Z.C. Landau B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2539-2542Google Scholar, 10Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Google Scholar). PC-dependent metabolism increases tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (10Schuit F. De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Google Scholar), which stimulates proportional NADPH production through pyruvate and citrate cycling as well as through isocitrate dehydrogenase (13MacDonald M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E302-E310Google Scholar). NADPH can be produced via cytoplasmic or mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase. A cycle is formed when isocitrate exits the mitochondrial matrix and is converted to α-ketoglutarate, which can then re-enter the mitochondrial matrix. The tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates and the NADPH produced likely modulate the ATP-dependent response because PC activity correlates directly with insulin secretion (11Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Google Scholar). Tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates are proposed to modulate the ATP-dependent response through the production of long chain acyl-CoA and other signaling molecules (6Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Google Scholar, 7Brun T. Roche E. Assimacopoulos-Jeannet F. Corkey B.E. Kim K.H. Prentki M. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 190-198Google Scholar). The NADPH produced is proposed to directly modulate the ATP-dependent pathway by acting as a substrate for nitric-oxide synthase and glutathione reductase (5MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Google Scholar). Regardless of the specific action of NADPH, its levels report on the “ATP-independent pathway” of insulin (4Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Google Scholar). Therefore, an assay of NADH and NADPH provides evidence for the metabolic fate of pyruvate and a measure of the ATP-dependent and -independent mechanisms of insulin secretion. Another source of redox related autofluorescence comes from cellular flavins (14Hassinen I. Chance B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 895-900Google Scholar, 15Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4764-4771Google Scholar). Like NAD(P)H, flavins show differential fluorescence between their oxidized and reduced states. In contrast to NAD(P)H, these molecules are fluorescent in their oxidized state. A significant fraction of flavin-associated autofluorescence is nonredox-responsive, resulting in significant nonresponsive intensity. A large contributor to this non-responsive intensity is free flavins, because their oxidation state is not directly coupled to the electron transport chain. Flavins are generally quenched when bound as protein cofactors (17Kunz W.S. Kunz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 841: 237-246Google Scholar, 18Voltti H. Hassinen I.E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1978; 10: 45-58Google Scholar). As a result of this quenching, the majority of flavoproteins contribute little to the autofluorescence intensity. Two flavoproteins that demonstrate significant redox-dependent changes in intensity are mitochondrial lipoamide dehydrogenase (LipDH) and electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) (14Hassinen I. Chance B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 895-900Google Scholar, 15Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4764-4771Google Scholar). The redox state of LipDH is in direct equilibrium with the mitochondrial [NADH]:[NAD+] ratio, so as mitochondrial NADH intensity rises, LipDH intensity falls. This equilibrium allows a distinction to be made between the nutrient-stimulated NADH and NADPH responses by comparison of NAD(P)H and LipDH autofluorescence. The NAD(P)H response is due to the combined NADH and NADPH responses in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Because of this combined response, the cellular NADPH response cannot be simply calculated from the NAD(P)H and LipDH responses. However, a rise in NAD(P)H without a change in LipDH indicates a NADPH response rather than NADH. Studies have used the red-shifted absorbance and emission of LipDH to isolate its fluorescence from that of ETF (17Kunz W.S. Kunz W. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1993; 50: 103-110Google Scholar, 20Kunz W.S. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 92-96Google Scholar). However, significant spectral overlap of LipDH and ETF results in mixed detection. Furthermore, the LipDH and ETF redox-dependent responses need to be characterized in pancreatic islets, and the contributions from other flavins and fluorophores need to be assessed. We show that a ratio of dual color confocal microscopy (488 and 458 nm) can be used to successfully isolate the LipDH response for independent comparison with the NAD(P)H response. Two-photon flavoprotein imaging has proven difficult (21Huang S. Heikal A.A. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2811-2825Google Scholar), so we developed quasi-simultaneous imaging of flavoproteins by confocal and NAD(P)H by two-photon imaging. We first confirm that the majority of flavin redox response in this tissue is due to LipDH and ETF. We also show that the LipDH response can be isolated from that of ETF by using a fluorescence ratio of excitation wavelengths (458:488 nm). Using this multicolor autofluorescence imaging method, we demonstrate that glucose stimulation results in concomitant production of NADH and NADPH. In contrast, pyruvate stimulates a transient rise of NADPH in the absence of a significant NADH response. These experiments provide evidence that exogenous pyruvate enters cycling routes to produce NADPH, but is unable to stimulate a significant metabolic NADH response, and thus does not elicit insulin secretion. Alcohol dehydrogenase (Baker's yeast), β-hydroxybutyrate, glucose, pyruvate, methyl pyruvate, rotenone, sodium cyanide, FAD, cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl hydrazone (FCCP), LipDH, NADH, and mannoheptulose were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hanks' balanced salt solution and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Invitrogen. MitoTracker Green FM and LysoTracker Green were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Islets were extracted from 6–12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice by collagenase (Roche Applied Science) digestion (22Scharp D.W. Kemp C.B. Knight M.J. Ballinger W.F. Lacy P.E. Transplantation. 1973; 16: 686-689Google Scholar, 23Stefan Y. Meda P. Neufeld M. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 175-183Google Scholar). The isolated islets were placed on human extracellular matrix (BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) coated 35-mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corp.) as previously described (24Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Google Scholar). After ∼14 days the cell matrix promotes spreading, and the islets flatten in appearance. These islets have been shown to exhibit normal glucose-stimulated NAD(P)H and insulin secretion (2Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Google Scholar, 25Arkhammar P.O.G. Bernard R Kofod T.H. Thastrup O. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 19: 255-268Google Scholar). Prior to experiments, these islets were equilibrated in imaging buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm glucose for 30–60 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Further treatments were added as indicated. Two-photon and confocal imaging was done using a LSM510 laser scanning microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63× 1.4 NA oil immersion lens (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thorwood, NY). The islets were kept at 37 °C using a temperature controlled stage and objective warmer (Zeiss Inc., Thorwood, NY). Autofluorescence Imaging—Sequential images of autofluorescence were collected using 710-(two-photon), 458-, and 488-nm excitation. Each was collected with a single slow speed scan (6.4 μs/pixel) at 0.29 μm/pixel. Two-photon imaging of NAD(P)H used a Coherent Mira laser tuned to 710 nm (Coherent Inc., Santa Clara, CA). The laser power used provided ∼3.5 mW to the surface; at this laser power no observable damage is caused to the islet (1Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Google Scholar) even after 60 min of continuous imaging (24Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Google Scholar). Nondescanned NAD(P)H fluorescence was collected through a custom 380–550-nm filter (Chroma Inc., Rockingham, VT). To limit exposure to single photon excitation, the islet regions were first brought into focus using two-photon excitation (fluorescence and differential interference contrast). Single photon confocal imaging was used only during data collection. Confocal imaging was done using the 458-nm laser line (∼3 μW at sample) and a long pass 475 emission filter or the 488-nm laser line (∼2.5 μW at sample) and a long pass 505 emission filter or the 543-nm laser line and a long pass 560 emission filter. The gain was set so that the bright nonresponding regions were at or near detector saturation, and this level was maintained throughout all experiments. The offset values for the 710-, 458-, and 488-nm channels were set to achieve a zero intensity intercept using standard curves of NADH, FAD, and LipDH in solution (26Piston D.W. Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 58: 31-48Google Scholar). These settings were monitored routinely. Spectra Imaging—Emission spectra generated from 458-nm excitation were measured using the META detector of the LSM510 microscope (Zeiss Inc., Thorwood, NY). Regions of interest were outlined using the LSM 510 Image Browser software (version 3.6). The data were extracted from five bright nonresponsive regions, five dim responsive regions, and one larger background region in each image. The background region was used for spectral correction. The treatments were carried out on five separate islets, and each separate islet provided spectra for the bright and dimmer fluorescence regions. Subcellular Markers—Living pancreatic islets were labeled with 30 nm MitoTraker Green FM at 37 °C for 30 min or 75 nm LysoTracker Green at 37 °C for 1 h. The islets were washed with imaging buffer. Image collection was done using sequential excitation with the 488 nm laser line with a band pass 500–530-nm emission filter and a 543-nm laser with a long pass 560 emission filter. Sequential image collection was used to minimize bleed through of the bright green fluorophores into the dimmer 543-nm excited autofluorescence. The data for Figs. 3 and 4 were collected using pharmacological treatments that successively reduced LipDH and ETF (14Hassinen I. Chance B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 895-900Google Scholar, 15Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4764-4771Google Scholar, 16Wagnieres G.A. Star W.M. Wilson B.C. Photochem.

Reduction of these ETC-linked flavoproteins quenches their autofluorescence, which allows assignment of the maximum intensity changes associated with each protein. The islets were initially placed at low redox potential in 2 mm glucose resulting in maximum LipDH and ETF intensities. After image collection, rotenone (10 μm) and β-hydroxybutyrate (10 mm) were incubated with the islets for 5 min. This treatment raised mitochondrial NADH by inhibiting the ETC at complex I (rotenone) while introducing a NADH producing metabolite (β-hydroxybutyrate). The resulting rise in mitochondrial NADH reduces LipDH fluorescence intensity (14Hassinen I. Chance B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 895-900Google Scholar, 15Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4764-4771Google Scholar). The change in intensity after rotenone and β-hydroxybutyrate treatment is associated with the quenching of LipDH. Finally, a stock solution was added to achieve a final concentration of 3 mm cyanide and 10 mm glucose. This treatment was incubated with the islet for 5 min prior to image collection inhibiting the final step of the ETC (complex III). Inhibition of complex III reduces ETF causing a decrease in its fluorescence intensity. The change in intensity after cyanide and glucose treatment is associated with the quenching of ETF.Fig. 4Relative changes in pancreatic islet autofluorescence to LipDH and ETF reduction. The images were collected using 710-(two-photon), 458-, and 488-nm excitation. The islets were equilibrated in imaging buffer with 2 mm glucose (open bars) before reduction of LipDH (black bars) and ETF (hatched bars). Left axis, the changes in intensity are reported relative to the fluorescence observed in 2 mm glucose. A break in the y axis at 1.4 units is introduced to better examine the changes in the 458- and 488-nm fluorescence. Right axis, relative changes in the 458:488-nm intensity ratio. The data are reported as the means ± S.E. of the mean (n = 5 islets).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Determination of the NAD(P)H and flavin concentrations was performed by imaging of standard solutions in deep well slides. FAD was imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer at 0, 13.5, 26.9, 53.9, and 108 μm. Stock FAD concentration was determined through absorbance at 450 nm, ϵ = 11,300 m-1 cm-1. LipDH was imaged in Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer at 0, 1.2, 2.3, 4.6, 9.3, and 18.6 μm. Stock LipDH concentration was determined by absorbance at 455 nm, ϵ = 11,300 m-1 cm-1. The absorbance ratio of 273 to 455 nm for the LipDH solution was close to 5.3, which indicates a 1:1 ratio of FAD to LipDH (27Patel M.S. Vettakkorumakankav N.N. Liu T.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 186-195Google Scholar). The NAD(P)H standard curve was done with NADH bound to alcohol dehydrogenase. This solution closely resembles cellular NAD(P)H because a majority of cellular NAD(P)H is enzyme bound in the cellular environment (28Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Google Scholar). NADH was titrated into a solution of ∼100 mg/ml alcohol dehydrogenase, 10 mm ethanol, 100 mm isobutyramide, 6 mm semicarbazide, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 9.0). These enzyme-bound NADH solutions were imaged at 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 1800, and 2500 μm. The images were exported in tagged image file format (tiff) for analysis using MetaMorph software (version 5.0). The images were filtered using a 3 × 3 median filter. An intensity threshold was set on the median filtered image. The low end of this threshold was adjusted to exclude nuclear regions, and the high end was set to partially exclude the very bright nonresponsive regions. A binary mask was made from the threshold. This mask was then eroded and dilated to remove noise pixels in the background regions. Image math using the final binary mask against the median filtered image allowed selection of our defined region for calculation of average autofluorescence intensity. Characterization of Pancreatic Islet Autofluorescence—To correctly assign the intensity changes associated with flavoproteins, the contribution from other autofluorescence sources, such as lipofuscin deposits, needed to be established. Flavins are excited with either 458- or 488-nm excitation, away from the maximum excitations of tryptophan (∼300 nm) and porphoryins (∼400 nm) (16Wagnieres G.A. Star W.M. Wilson B.C. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 603-632Google Scholar). The images were collected from living pancreatic islets using a wide range of excitations (Fig. 1). These images were collected with four sequential scans using the 710-(two-photon excitation; Fig. 1, A and B), 458-(Fig. 1, C and D), 488-(Fig. 1, E and F), and 543-nm (Fig. 1, G and H) laser lines. The left (Fig. 1, A, C, E, and G) and right (Fig. 1, B, D, F, and H) images were collected from the islet in buffer containing low (2 mm) and high (20 mm) glucose concentrations, respectively. These images demonstrate the type of autofluorescence generated by a wide range of excitation. NAD(P)H is the main autofluorescent fluorophore observed using two-photon 710-nm excitation and 380–550-nm emission collection (1Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Google Scholar, 24Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and B). These images demonstrate dark nuclear regions as well as bright regions dispersed over a relatively diffuse fluorescence. The bright regions correspond to mitochondria, which have a higher NAD(P)H concentration than the cytoplasmic regions (2Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Google Scholar, 28Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897Google Scholar). This results in the mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal dominating the measured response. As expected, there was a significant rise in NAD(P)H fluorescence (∼2-fold) with increased extracellular glucose (Fig. 1, A and B). Like 710-nm two-photon excitation, the 458- and 488-nm generated images have large dark regions corresponding to individual nuclei, as well as bright regions dispersed over dimmer fluorescence (Fig. 1, C–F). Absent from these images is any significant membrane intensity, which indicates minimal contribution from plasma membrane-bound flavoproteins such as NADPH oxidase. As expected for flavin fluorescence (and opposite of the NAD(P)H response), the image intensity fell as glucose was raised. However, in both the 458- and 488-nm images, the brightest regions were nonresponsive to this change in cellular redox potential. In contrast, the dim regions decrease in intensity. This dim population does not contain any definable subregions that change differentially upon glucose stimulation. The 543-nm excited images demonstrate a spotted fluorescence that did not perceivably change with glucose addition (Fig. 1, G and H). The brightest regions in these 543-nm images overlap significantly with the bright redox-nonresponsive regions of the 458- and 488-nm images (Observe the yellow overlap in Fig. 1I and J). These data indicate that the autofluorescence from living pancreatic islets demonstrate intensity changes consistent with flavoproteins. However, a number of bright subcellular regions are redox-nonresponsive and scattered throughout the cytoplasm. Mitochondrial and lysozomal subcellular markers were used to further characterize the redox-nonresponsive regions of this tissue (Fig. 2). The 543-nm generated image was used to compare the nonresponsive regions (Fig. 2, C and D) with mitochondrial (Fig. 2E) or lysozomal (Fig. 2F) subcellular markers. Little overlap was observed between the nonresponsive regions and the mitochondrial dye, consistent with this fluorescence not originating from mitochondrial flavoproteins (Fig. 2, compare C and E and overlap in G). In contrast, significant overlap was observed between the nonresponsive regions and a lysozomal cellular marker (Fig. 2, compare D and F and overlap in H). These data indicate that the redox-nonresponsive intensity originates from acidic vesicles rather than from mitochondria. To further characterize the autofluorescence gathered from this tissue, images were collected of living pancreatic islets using 458-nm excitation and spectral detection (Fig. 3). This method provides both spectral and spatial resolution, which allows separate analysis of the redox-responsive and -nonresponsive regions. Shown in Fig. 3A are the normalized spectra of the bright nonresponsive regions and the dimmer responsive cellular regions. The bright nonresponsive regions have a broader red shoulder (525–620 nm) than the responsive regions. Therefore, these bright nonresponsive regions are broadly excited, overlap significantly with acidic vesicles, and have a broader red emission shoulder than the redox-responsive regions. These characteristics are consistent with lipofuscin deposits that accumulate with age in postmitotic cells (29Brunk U.T. Terman A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 611-619Google Scholar). Because these deposits are spotted and significantly bright, they were relatively easy to avoid during analysis of the redoxresponsive regions. Spectral imaging was used to further examine the fluorescence from the redox-responsive regions of the cell. In comparison with LipDH and FAD in solution, the redox-responsive regions have a broader blue side of the spectra (Fig. 3B). This broadening is not due to scatter of the 458-nm excitation light in the cellular environment because the separation between cellular and solution fluorescence does not rise from 492 to 478 nm. Thus it is likely that this blue shifting is from ETF fluorescence, a component of mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence. The red side of all these spectra is similar, consistent with this cellular fluorescence coming from flavins. To examine the contribution of LipDH and ETF to the cellular fluorescence, we used treatments to successively quench these proteins (Fig. 3, C and D). The changes in spectra caused by these treatments are then compared with the known or measured spectra of LipDH, ETF, and free flavins. The bright spotted regions were nonresponsive to both of these treatments (Fig. 3C). In contrast, significant changes occurred in the dim regions (Fig. 3D). The intensity dropped in the range of 500–580 nm after the reduction of LipDH (▪ versus ○), consistent with the measured spectra of this flavoprotein. There was a small but significant drop in intensity from 479 to 530 nm after ETF reduction (○ versus ▴), consistent with the blue shifted emission spectra of this flavoprotein (30Hall C.L. Kamin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3476-3486Google Scholar). A significant amount of fluorescence remains after both of these treatments, which likely originates from free flavins (14Hassinen I. Chance B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 31: 895-900Google Scholar, 15Chance B. Schoener B. Oshino R. Itshak F. Nakase Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4764-4771Google Scholar, 16Wagnieres G.A. Star W.M.

Biomembr. 1978; 10: 45-58Google Scholar). Therefore, the redox response of LipDH and ETF are contained in the observed fluorescence changes. The remaining fluorescence contributes to the base-line intensity. Although this base line complicates calculation of absolute flavoprotein concentrations, it does not affect interpretation of changes in redox potential caused by LipDH and ETF. Redox-associated Flavin Autofluorescence Changes—We examined the 458:488 nm intensity ratio as a means of isolating the LipDH response from ETF. LipDH has a red-shifted excitation spectrum in comparison with free flavins and ETF (31Maeda-Yorita K. Aki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo)."

The reaction requires ATP, a fatty acid, and CoA with an overall reaction scheme as described in Reaction 1. fatty acid+CoA+ATP→fatty acyl-CoA+PPi+AMP REACTION 1Reaction 1 The FACS family catalyzes the formation of fatty acyl-CoA in two discrete steps: 1) the formation of a fatty acyl-AMP molecule as a stable intermediate (Reaction 2) and 2) the formation of a fatty acyl-CoA molecule as the final product (Reaction 3). fatty acid+ATP→fatty acyl-AMP+PPifatty acyl-AMP+CoA→fatty acyl-CoA+AMP REACTIONS 2 AND 3Reaction 2 The esterification of fatty acids by LC-FACS has been proposed to proceed via a Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping-Pong mechanism (21Cleland W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 67: 104-137Google Scholar) based on extensive kinetic studies of the rat enzyme (22Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Brandes R. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 199-209Google Scholar). However, to date the fatty acyl-AMP intermediate has not been isolated nor utilized experimentally as substrate for the second step (Reaction 3) or as product for the first step (Reaction 2) in reverse catalysis (23Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 411-416Google Scholar, 24Philipp D.P. Parsons P. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10785-10790Google Scholar) in contrast to the acetyl-AMP or butyryl-AMP for SC- or MC-FACSs (25Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 222: 991-1013Google Scholar, 26Guranowski A. Gunther Sillero M.A. Sillero A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2986-2990Google Scholar, 27Takao S. Ito T. Tamida M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 145-152Google Scholar). The crystal structures of four adenylate forming enzymes have so far been reported: luciferase (28Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar), phenylalanine-activating A domain (PheA) (29Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar), 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-activating E domain (DhbE) (30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Google Scholar), and acetyl CoA synthetase (SC-FACS) (31Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Google Scholar, 32Jogl G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1425-1431Google Scholar). The members of this superfamily show a 20–30% amino acid sequence identity with several highly conserved regions, and all catalyze the formation of acyl-AMP from ATP and a carboxylated molecule including a fatty acid and an amino acid. All four enzymes consist of a large N-terminal and a small C-terminal domain, with the catalytic site formed at the junction between the two domains. The relative positions of the C- and N-terminal domains may change upon substrate binding. In the absence of substrate, the C-terminal domain of luciferase was shown to be in an open conformation. Upon substrate binding, a closed conformation is adopted where the C- and N-terminal domains approach one another, thus reducing the accessibility of the active site to solvent as reported in the crystal structures of substrate-bound PheA (29Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar), DhbE (30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Google Scholar) and SC-FACS (31Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Google Scholar, 32Jogl G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1425-1431Google Scholar). However, there does appear to be a certain amount of variability in the extent of these conformational changes because the uncomplexed form of DhbE showed a closed conformation (30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Google Scholar). Furthermore the structure of SC-FACS with bound substrate analogue for the second half-reaction revealed the existence of the reverse closed conformation of the C-terminal domain compared with those of PheA and DhbE, suggesting that another large structural rearrangement is needed between the first and second reactions as supported by the recent crystal studies of SC-FACS with AMP (31Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Google Scholar, 32Jogl G. Tong L. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1425-1431Google Scholar). LC-FACS has been presumed to catalyze acylation in the same manner because of the sequence similarity and the results of extensive mutation studies based on homology modeling using the known crystal structures (8Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Google Scholar, 10Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Sherin D. MacColl R. Kundsen J. Weimar J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38547-38553Google Scholar). However, the structure-function relationship of LC-FACS was still unclear particularly with respect to the formation and subsequent processing of the acyl-AMP intermediate. We have determined the first three-dimensional structure of a LC-FACS domain swap homodimer from an extreme thermophile, Thermus thermophilus HB8 (ttLC-FACS) (33Yokoyama S. Hirota H. Kigawa T. Yabuki T. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Ito Y. Matsuo Y. Kuroda Y. Nishimura Y. Kyogoku Y. Miki K. Masui R. Kuramitsu S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 943-945Google Scholar) overexpressed in E. coli. We also determined the structure of the enzyme complexed to AMP-PNP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. Furthermore, we identified the acyl adenylate intermediate as myristoyl-AMP in the complex crystal structure using the crystals of the AMP-PNP complex acylated by soaking in myristate solution. Based on these high resolution structures, we propose a two-step catalytic mechanism for ttLC-FACS involving a single closed conformation induced by ATP binding (Reaction 2). ttLC-FACS possesses a gated fatty acid-binding tunnel with a dead end branch in each monomer. The unidirectional movement of fatty acid is proposed as a unidirectional Bi Uni Uni Bi Ping-Pong mechanism based on these crystal structures. Expression and Purification—The ttLC-FACS gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-ATATCATATGGAAGGGGAAAGGATGAACGCGTTCCCAA-3′ and 5′-ATATAGATCTTTATTAGGCGCCTCCGTAGTAGTTCTTGTAC-3′ from T. thermophilus HB8 cDNA. The amplified gene fragment was cloned into the pT7Blue (Novagen). After confirmation of the nucleotide sequence, the ttLC-FACS gene was ligated into the expression vector pET-11a (Novagen) at the NdeI/BamHI sites. The ttLC-FACS expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) for overexpression. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml of ampicillin in LB medium for 20 h and harvested by centrifugation. The centrifuged pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and heated to 70 °C for 11.5 min. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. After centrifugation, ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant, and the 30–60% (w/v) fraction was applied sequentially to HiTrap-Q HP and HiTrap-Blue HP columns (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. The purity of samples was verified using SDS-PAGE stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue, which confirmed the presence of a single band of about 60 kDa eluted from the HiTrap-Blue HP chromatography (supplemental figure). Assay of ttLC-FACS Activity—The activity of acyl-CoA synthetase was assayed at 25 °C by an enzyme coupled spectrophotometric method (34Hosaka K. Mishina M. Tanaka T. Kamiryo T. Numa S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 93: 197-203Google Scholar). The assay measures the rate of AMP formation by coupling the reaction of acyl-CoA synthetase with those of adenylate kinase, pyruvate kinase, and lactase dehydrogenase and then detects the oxidation of NADH at 334 nm with a spectrophotometer (SHIMAZU UV-2100PC). The standard reaction mixture for this assay contains 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.6 mm Triton X-100, 7.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CoA, 0.2 mm potassium phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.15 mm NADH, 20 μg/ml adenylate kinase, 30 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, 30 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 5 μg/ml ttLC-FACS. The magnesium-free assay was performed in the presence of 10 mm EDTA instead of MgCl2. Crystallization—The crystals of the uncomplexed ttLC-FACS were obtained by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. The crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 3 μl of ttLC-FACS solution (9.2 mg/ml purified ttLC-FACS, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) with 3 μl of reservoir solution (0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 0.1 m guanidine hydrochloride). The crystals grew to dimensions 0.3 × 0.15 × 0.1 mm within 1 month. The substitution of 10 mm CoA for guanidine hydrochloride improved both the reproducibility and quality of the crystal. These improved crystals were used to prepare heavy atom derivatives by soaking with a solution containing 21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 5.5), 0.2 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm CoA, and 1 mm thimerosal for 5 days. Crystals of the AMP-PNP complex were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 20 °C by mixing 3 μl of ttLC-FACS solution (14 mg/ml ttLC-FACS, 10 mm AMP-PNP, 10 mm CoA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) and 3 μl of reservoir solution (50 mm MES/NaOH, pH 6.5, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol mono methyl ester 5000). The myristoyl-AMP complex crystals were prepared by soaking AMP-PNP complex crystals into a sodium myristate solution (125 μm) containing 10 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm AMP-PNP for 24 h. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—The diffraction data were collected using beam lines (BL26B1, BL41XU, and BL45XU) (35Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Yamashita E. Moriyama H. Ueki T. Structure. 2002; 10: 1205-1210Google Scholar) at SPring-8 at 100 K. Before flash cooling, the crystals were washed with the reservoir solution containing 20% (v/v) glycerol to avoid formation of ice. The mercury derivative, thimerosal crystal was measured at four different wavelengths to obtain a data set for the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction method. All of the images were processed by HKL2000 (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Initial phases were calculated by the program SOLVE (37Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) using multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data from the mercury derivative up to 2.0 Å resolution (Tables I and II). These phases were improved by the program RESOLVE (38Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Google Scholar), and initial model building was performed by the program ARP/wARP (39Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 968-975Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the uncomplexed ttLC-FACS, the AMP-PNP complex, and the myristoyl-AMP complex were determined by the molecular replacement method using AMoRe (40Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Google Scholar) and Molrep (41Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Google Scholar) and the atomic coordinates of the mercury derivative ttLC-FACS. Manual model building and the subsequent iterative crystallographic refinement were performed using the programs O (42Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), CNS (43Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar), and REFMAC5 (44Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). The dictionaries of AMP-PNP and myristoyl-AMP used for the restrained crystallographic refinement were prepared by QUANTA/CHARMm (Accelrys) and REFMAC5 (44Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar). Although the reflections for Rfree validation (5% for apo data set and 10% for ligand complexes) were independently selected for each diffraction data set, the molecular replacement method and the simulated annealing method starting from over 3000 K were performed to remove the model bias at the initial refinement cycle for each structure (43Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The crystal structures of apo ttLC-FACS at 2.55 Å, AMP-PNP complex at 2.3 Å, and myristoyl-AMP complex at 2.5 Å were refined with Rfree values of 0.25, 0.24, and 0.24, respectively. The geometrical quality was checked using PROCHECK (45Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). The current atomic coordinates have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank (46Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalow I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) with accession codes 1ULT, 1V25, and 1V26.

After the sequence alignment using T-coffee (49Notredame C. Higgins D. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Google Scholar), phylogenetic analysis was performed using PHYLIP (50Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of four structurally characterized family members luciferase (28Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar), PheA (29Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar), DhbE (30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12120-12125Google Scholar), and SC-FACS (31Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Google Scholar) were aligned structurally with ttLC-FACS using QUANTA (Accerylys) with manual modification. Enzyme Activity and Sequence Analysis—The overexpressed and purified ttLC-FACS protein was shown to catalyze the esterification of a number of long chain fatty acids with CoA in the presence of Triton X-100. No activity was detected in the absence of detergent or Mg2+ ions (3Krisans S.K. Mortensen R.M. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9599-9607Google Scholar, 19Saunders C. Voigt J.M. Weis M.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 849-853Google Scholar, 22Bar-Tana J. Rose G. Brandes R. Shapiro B. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 199-209Google Scholar, 27Takao S. Ito T. Tamida M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 145-152Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Myristate (C14) is the most efficiently processed fatty acid at 25 °C, followed by palmitate (C16). The esterification of stearate (C18) and laurate (C12) was also catalyzed but at lower efficiency. In contrast, ttLC-FACS did not catalyze the esterification of the unsaturated fatty acids mysteroleic and palmitoleic acids. The amino acid sequence of ttLC-FACS was aligned with other LC-FACSs (Fig. 2A). Although the overall sequence homology is low, about 20% sequence identity or less to other LC-FACSs, there are conserved regions corresponding to the linker (L), adenine (A), and gate (G) motifs as well as the P-loop (Thr184-Thr-Gly-Thr-Thr-Gly-Leu-Pro-Lys192), the phosphate-binding site (Fig. 2A) (7Black P.N. DiRusso C.C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 454-472Google Scholar, 8Weimar J.D. DiRusso C.C. Delio R. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29369-29376Google Scholar, 10Black P.N. DiRusso C.C.

The motifs were designated based on the ttLC-FACS structures presented in this paper. The L motif (Asp432-Arg-Leu-Lys-Asp-Leu437) contains the peptide that acts as a linker between the N- and C-terminal domains, the A motif (Gly323-Tyr-Gly-Lue-Thr-Glu-Thr329) contains the adenine-binding residue Tyr324, whereas the G motif (Val226-Pro-Met-Phe-His-Val-Asn-Ala-Trp234) contains the gate residue Trp234 and the surrounding mobile peptide as described below. Overall Structure—ttLC-FACS forms a domain swapped dimer (52Liu Y. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1285-1299Google Scholar). The monomers of the dimer interact at their N-terminal domains with a contact surface area of 3600 Å2 for each monomer (Fig. 3). At the back of the domain swapping surface, there is a large electrostatically positive concave in the central valley of the homodimer (Fig. 3B). Each ttLC-FACS monomer swaps the eight residues from Ala8 to Glu16 into a ridge on the surface of the other N-terminal domain (Fig. 3C). In the dimer interactions, Asp15 forms an intermolecular salt bridge with Arg176. The main chain carbonyl group of Glu16 forms an inter-molecular hydrogen bond with the side chain of Arg199, whereas Glu175 and Arg199 form an intermolecular salt bridge at the interface (Fig. 3C). The multisequence alignment of LC-FACS (Fig. 2A) reveals that residues corresponding to Asp15, Glu16, Arg176, and Arg199 are highly conserved among the LC-FACS family but not conserved in the other related enzyme families (Fig 2B). Therefore, this type of domain swapped homodimer may be a characteristic feature in LC-FACS but not common in other adenylate forming enzyme families (Fig. 2) (28Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar, 29Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar, 30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1425-1431Google Scholar). Each monomer of ttLC-FACS is composed of a large N-terminal domain (residues 1–431) and a small C-terminal domain (residues 438–541) that are connected by a six-amino acid peptide linker, the L motif (residues 432–437) (Figs. 2 and 3D). The core region of the large N-terminal domain exhibits a fold similar to that seen in other adenylate-forming enzymes (28Conti E. Franks N.P. Brick P. Structure. 1996; 4: 287-298Google Scholar, 29Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar, 30May J.J. Kessler N. Marahiel M.A. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1425-1431Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain can be further divided into two subdomains: a distorted antiparallel β-barrel and two β-sheets that are flanked on both sides by α-helices forming an αβαβα sandwich. The small C-terminal globular domain is comprised of a two-stranded β-sheet and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that is surrounded by three α-helices.

By using the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin as a bait for screening protein interactors, we have identified ZRP-1 (zyxin-related protein 1), a 476-amino acid member that belongs to a family of LIM containing proteins that includes zyxin and lipoma-preferred partner. The endoglin interacting region was mapped within the three double zinc finger LIM domains of the ZRP-1 C terminus. Analysis of the subcellular distribution of ZRP-1 demonstrated that in the absence of endoglin, ZRP-1 mainly localizes to focal adhesion sites, whereas in the presence of endoglin ZRP-1 is found along actin stress fibers. Because the LIM family of proteins has been shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton, we investigated the possibility of a regulatory role for endoglin with regard to this structure. Expression of endoglin resulted in a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. In the absence of endoglin, F-actin was localized to dense aggregates of bundles, whereas in the presence of endoglin, expressed in endothelial cells, F-actin was in stress fibers and colocalized with ZRP-1. Furthermore, small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of endoglin or ZRP-1, or clustering of endoglin in endothelial cells, led to mislocalization of F-actin fibers. These results suggest a regulatory role for endoglin, via its interaction with ZRP-1, in the actin cytoskeletal organization.

Endoglin is a type I membrane glycoprotein expressed as a disulfide-linked homodimer of 180 kDa at the surface of endothelial cells, activated macrophages, fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells (1Adam P.J.

Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2645-2657Google Scholar). Experimental evidence supports an important role for endoglin in cardiovascular development and vascular remodeling. Thus, endoglin expression is regulated during heart development in humans and chicken (8Qu R. Silver M.M. Letarte M. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 333-343Google Scholar, 9Vincent E.B. Runyan R.B. Weeks D.L. Dev.

Silver M.M. Letarte M. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 333-343Google Scholar). Endoglin-null mice obtained by targeted disruption of the endoglin gene die at 10-11.5 days postcoitum due to vascular and cardiac anomalies (10Arthur H.M. Ure J. Smith A.J.H. Renforth G. Wilson D.I.

Furthermore, the gene encoding endoglin is the target for the autosomal dominant disorder known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 (13McAllister K.A. Grogg K.M. Johnson D.W.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 is a vascular disorder whose most common clinical manifestations include telangiectases on skin and mucosa as well as arteriovenous malformations in brain, lung, and liver (14Guttmacher A.E.

However, a TGF-β independent function has been proposed based on the fact that only 1% of the total endoglin molecules are able to bind TGF-β1 in endothelial cells (8Qu R. Silver M.M. Letarte M. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 333-343Google Scholar). In this sense, overexpression of endoglin in fibroblasts or smooth muscle cells leads to an altered cellular morphology, migration, and adhesion (6Ma K. Labinaz M. Goldstein J. Miller H. Keon W.J.

ZRP-1 (zyxin-related protein 1), also called TRIP6 (thyroid receptor interacting protein 6), is a cytoplasmic protein of 476 amino acid residues (22Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 20679-20687Google Scholar). Expression of Zrp-1 in mouse embryos begins at day 16.5 of gestation, reaching in the adult high levels on endothelial and epithelial cells and low levels on muscle cells (25Cuppen E. van Ham M. Wansink D.G. de Leeuw A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Google Scholar). Accordingly, strong expression of human ZRP-1 transcripts was detected in highly vascularized tissues such as lung, placenta, heart, and kidney. ZRP-1 belongs to a subset of LIM domain containing proteins that include the prototypic member zyxin and lipoma-preferred partner (LPP). LIM domains are cysteine-rich motifs of 55 amino acid residues that display a double zinc finger structure and are involved in protein-protein interactions (26Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Google Scholar). Analysis of the ZRP-1 sequence shows two distinct regions: a C-terminal half containing three LIM domains, and a proline-rich N-terminal half containing a nuclear export sequence (27Wang Y. Gilmore T.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 260-272Google Scholar). Several ZRP-1 interactors have been reported to bind through the LIM domains, including the thyroid receptor (22Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Endocrinology. 1995; 9: 243-254Google Scholar, 23Yi J. Beckerle M.C. Genomics. 1998; 49: 314-316Google Scholar), the tyrosine phosphatase hPTP1E (24Murthy K.K.

Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Google Scholar), v-Rel (28Zhao M.K. Wang Y. Murphy K. Yi J. Bekerle M.C. Gilmore T.D. Gene Expr. 1999; 8: 207-217Google Scholar), the adaptor protein RIL (25Cuppen E. van Ham M. Wansink D.G. de Leeuw A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Google Scholar), the OpaP protein from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (29Williams J.M. Chen G.C. Zhu L. Rest R.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 171-186Google Scholar), and the CasL/HEF1 and p130Cas members of Cas family (30Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Google Scholar). ZRP-1 shares with zyxin and LPP not only their structural homology but also its association with the cytoskeleton. ZRP-1 and zyxin are localized along actin stress fibers and at cell-cell and cell-substrate contact regions (25Cuppen E. van Ham M. Wansink D.G. de Leeuw A. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 283-293Google Scholar, 30Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Google Scholar, 31Macalma T. Otte J.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 403-409Google Scholar), whereas LPP is only located at focal adhesions and cell-to-cell contacts (33Petit M.M.R. Fradelizi J. Golstein R.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Menichi B. Luovard D. Van de Ven W.J.M. Friederich E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 117-129Google Scholar, 34Petit M.M. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N. Van de Ven W.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 118-129Google Scholar). The similarities between zyxin and ZRP-1 at the protein structure and subcellular localization levels suggest a similar functional role for both molecules, which are postulated to serve as a docking site for the assembly of multimeric protein complexes involved in regulating cytoskeleton assembly and cell motility. Zyxin appears to play an important role in the spatial control of actin cytoskeleton assembly by interacting with the Ena/VASP-profilin complex, with α-actinin, or with Vav (35Beckerle M.C. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 949-957Google Scholar, 36Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Google Scholar, 37Reinhard M. Zumbrunn J. Jaquemar D. Kuhn M. Walter U. Trueb B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13410-13418Google Scholar). In fact, delocalization of zyxin in cultured cells, by its targeting to the inner face of the plasma membrane or to mitochondria, leads to the assembly of short actin stress fibers at the new location of zyxin (36Drees B. Friederich E. Fradelizi J. Louvard D. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22503-22511Google Scholar, 38Fradelizi J. Noireaux V. Plastino J. Menichi B. Louvard D. Sykes C. Golsteyn R.M. Friederich E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 699-707Google Scholar). This is similar to the function displayed by ActA, a zyxin homologous protein, that is expressed at the surface of Listeria monocytogenes and is involved in pathogen invasion of the host cell (39Drees B. Andrews K.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1549-1559Google Scholar, 40Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Google Scholar, 41Nix A. Fradelizi J. Bockholt S. Menichi B. Louvard D. Friederich E. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34759-34767Google Scholar). In addition, ZRP-1 seems to be connected to the cytoskeleton through binding to proteins involved in the actin assembly, such as the adaptor protein RIL, the tyrosine phosphatase hPTP1E, members of Cas family proteins, or the OpaP protein from N. gonorrhoeae. It is worth noting that the OpaP protein is located at the external surface of the bacteria and is involved in adhesion and invasion of the host cell by altering the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (29Williams J.M. Chen G.C. Zhu L. Rest R.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 171-186Google Scholar). Also, the association with members of the Cas family of adaptor proteins suggests the involvement of zyxin and ZRP-1 in cell motility, a process highly dependent on the actin cytoskeleton (30Yi J. Kloeker S. Jensen C.C. Bockholt S. Honda H. Hirai H. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9580-9589Google Scholar). Here we have identified ZRP-1 as a protein able to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin. The subcellular distribution of ZRP-1 along actin stress fibers or at focal adhesion sites was found to be dependent on the expression of endoglin, suggesting a regulatory role for endoglin in the cytoskeletal organization. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed with a GAL4-based MATCHMAKER System (Clontech) with yeast strains Y190 and Y187 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cytoplasmic domain of endoglin (amino acids 612-658) was cloned into the “bait” vector pAS2-1. A human lung cDNA library (Clontech) was screened using the endoglin bait. DNA was isolated from positive yeast clones and transformed into competent Escherichia coli (TOP10, Invitrogen), according to standard protocols. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM™ 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Cell Culture—COS-7 (African green monkey kidney), L6E9 (rat myoblasts), and 293T (human kidney) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). L6E9 transfectants expressing L-human endoglin or betaglycan (19Letamendia A. Lastres P. Botella L.M. Raab U. Langa C. Velasco B. Attisano L. Bernabeu C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33011-33019Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FCS and 400 μg/ml of the antibiotic G418. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were obtained from Promocell, plated in gelatin-coated plates and grown in MCDB-131 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), and endothelial cell growth supplement/heparin (ECGS-H2; Promocell GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated from cannulated vessels incubated in the presence of collagenase. Detached cells were plated on gelatin-coated flasks and grown in medium 199 supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml bovine brain extract. Transfections—COS-7, L6E9, and 293T cells were transiently transfected with the use of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer′s instructions for adherent cells. Briefly, cells were trypsinized, plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates (1-3 × 105 cells per plate), and incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FCS for 18-24 h, until the cells reached 50-70% confluency. Cells were washed once with serum-free medium; the lipid-DNA complex was added in serum-free medium, and transfection was allowed to occur for 3 h at 37 °C. Then fresh medium with 10% FCS was added, and cells were incubated for 48 h before analysis of the recombinant protein. HUVECs were transiently transfected using a Nucleofector™ (Amaxa Biosystems), following the manufacturer's instructions for adherent cells. Cells were harvested by trypsinization followed by centrifugation (2 × 105-2 × 106 cells per nucleofection sample) at 200 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was completely discarded so that no residual medium covered the pellet. The pellet was resuspended in HUVEC Nucleofector™ solution (VPB-1002 kit, Amaxa Biosystems) at room temperature to a final concentration of 2 × 105-2 × 106 cells/100 μl and mixed with 1-5 μg of DNA. The sample was transferred into a cuvette (Amaxa), avoiding air bubbles while pipetting. The cuvette was inserted into the Nucleofector™, and the appropriate electroporation program (U-01) was allowed to run. The cuvette was immediately removed after the program had finished, and pre-warmed culture medium containing serum and supplements was added to the cuvette, and cells were transferred using plastic pipettes to 6-well plates. Cells were incubated in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator, and gene expression was analyzed 48h after nucleofection with DNA. Gene transfer efficiency was typically monitored by flow cytometry (COS-7, L6E9, and 293T cells) or microscopy (HUVECs) upon transfection of the pEGFP-C1 reporter vector encoding the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transfection efficiency was 70-80% in 293T, 30-40% in L6E9, 60-75% in COS, and <15% in HUVEC cells. Plasmid Constructs—For protein expression in E. coli, DNA segments encoding the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin (amino acids 612-658) or betaglycan (amino acids 805-849) were generated by PCR using Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cloned in pGEX-1λT and pGEX4T-3 vectors, respectively. Mammalian expression plasmid containing HA-tagged endoglin was constructed by subcloning the PCR-amplified full-length endoglin cDNA into the pDisplay vector (Invitrogen) (42Bellón T. Corbi A. Lastres P. Cales C. Cebrian M. Vera S. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2340-2345Google Scholar). Constructs for the expression of extracellular domain (ECTM-Endo, amino acids 26-614) or the intracellular domain (TMCT-Endo, amino acids 573-658) of endoglin were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pDisplay vector in-frame with the HA epitope (42Bellón T. Corbi A. Lastres P. Cales C. Cebrian M. Vera S. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Letarte M. Bernabeu C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2340-2345Google Scholar). In order to generate EGFP fusion proteins, full-length or partial ZRP-1 was inserted into the pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vector. The pEGFP-C1/ZRP-1 plasmid was generated by ligating the KpnI/XbaI double digest pcDNA/FLAG-ZRP-1 vector fragment with the KpnI/XbaI digest pEGFP-C1 vector. To generate EGFP-1/274 ZRP-1 (amino acids 1-274), EGFP-234/476 ZRP-1 (amino acids 234-476), and EGFP-272/476 ZRP-1 (amino acids 272-476), the corresponding DNA fragments were generated by PCR with the use of oligonucleotides with add-on sequences that allowed cloning of these fragments into the pEGFP-C1 vector, in-frame with the sequence of EGFP protein. All constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Human ZRP-1 cDNAs, subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pAC-TAG2, tagged at the N terminus with an HA epitope, and the C-terminal portion of ZRP-1 containing the 3 LIM domains subcloned in-frame with the maltose-binding protein (MBP) into the plasmid pMal-C2, have been described (24Murthy K.K. Clark K. Fortin Y. Shen S.H. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20679-20687Google Scholar). For RNA interference studies, the pSUPER-Endo-Ex4 vector was generated by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to exon 4 of the human endoglin gene (AACACCACAGAGCTGCCATCCTT) into BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER plasmid (Oligoengine). Similarly, the pSUPER-ZRP-1-356 vector was generated by inserting a double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to amino acids 356-363 of human ZRP-1 (AAGGCCTACCACCCTGGCTGCTT) into pSUPER. Upon transfection, the pSUPER-Endo-Ex4 or pSUPER-ZRP-1-356 vectors generated intracellular expression of small endoglin RNA molecules that silence human endoglin or ZRP-1 genes, respectively (data not shown). The pSUPER-C vector (generous gift of Dr. Olga Camacho), used as a negative control, was generated by inserting an endoglin-unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide (TGAGACAAGTCTTACAGAT) into the BglII/HindIII sites of pSUPER plasmid. Human endoglin cDNA, subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 and tagged in its C terminus with a Myc epitope, was a gift from Dr. Douglas Marchuk (43Lux A. Gallione C.J. Marchuk D.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 745-755Google Scholar). The expression vector peGFPC1-SV40 encoding EGFP tagged with the nuclear localization signal of SV40-T (44Munster A.K. Weinhold B. Gotza B. Muhlenhoff M. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19688-19696Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Gerardy-Schahn (Institute für Physiologische Chemie/Proteinstruktur, Hannover, Germany). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells were lysed on ice for 30 min with lysis buffer (1% digitonin, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitors mixture, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm Na2MoO4). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of cleared cell lysates containing the same amount of protein were incubated with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech), anti-hemagglutinin mAb (Roche Applied Science), anti-ZRP-1 (BD Biosciences), or anti-endoglin mAb P4A4 (45Pichuantes S. Vera S. Bourdeau A. Pece N. Kumar S. Letarte M. Tissue Antigens. 1997; 50: 265-276Google Scholar) for 3 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. The immune complexes were eluted by boiling 5 min in SDS sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.) and immunoblotted with the corresponding antibodies. Expression of the transfected proteins was monitored by immunoblotting of proteins in total cell lysates. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—For in vitro pull-down assays, MBP and GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α following the manufacturer's instructions. The proteins in the bacterial pellet were solubilized in Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) (buffer A), and sonicated. Lysates of each of the extracts (with the same amount of fusion protein) were mixed with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads, and the total volume was adjusted to 250 μl with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, containing protease inhibitors (buffer B). The precipitation was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C. The glutathione beads were separated by a brief centrifugation, washed five times with buffer B, and analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-serum anti-MBP (New England Biolabs). To perform the pull-down assays with EGFP fusion proteins, aliquots of EGFP fusion protein cell lysates were incubated for 6 h at 4 °C with 15 μg of GST or GST-Ecyt fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from pSuper transient transfectants was extracted by using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen). One microgram of this RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using random hexamers in a total volume of 20 μl. After the RT reaction, the total volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and 5 μl was used for PCRs in the presence of 10 μm final concentration of each oligonucleotide for ZRP1 (5′-GAT CCC CGG CCT ACC ACC CTG GCT GCT TCA AGA GAG CAG CCA GGG TGG TAG GCC TTT TTG GAA A-3′ and 5′-AGC TTT TCC AAA AAT TGT TGC TCT GGA TCG AAG TCT CTT GAA GCA GCC AGG GTG GTA GGC CGG G-3′), or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-GACGCCTGGTTACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTCCTTGGAGGCGATG 3′) amplification. Samples of 10 μl were taken after 35 cycles. PCR was performed using the HotMaster Taq polymerase (Eppendorf) with hot start, and the amplification conditions were as follows: 5 min at 95 °C, followed by cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 52 °C, and 1 min at 68 °C with a final elongation step of 5 min at 72 °C. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown onto 12-mm diameter glass coverslips coated with 0.5% gelatin in 24-well cell culture plates. Cells were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS, and after being washed, blocking was done with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were incubated 1 h at 4 °C with mouse anti-endoglin P4A4 antibody, as indicated. When necessary, cells were permeabilized with 100 μg/ml l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine and stained with rabbit anti-ZRP-1 antibody B59 (a kind gift from Dr. M. Beckerle) or mouse anti-vinculin (Sigma). This was followed by incubation with Alexa-488 green-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse IgG antibody or Alexa-546 red-conjugated anti mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes). For staining actin filaments, cells were fixed, stained, and permeabilized in a single step by the addition of a 2× cold solution containing 5 units/ml rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes), 0.5 mg/ml l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine, and 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS. After 20 min at 4 °C, cells were washed twice in cold PBS. The stained cells were mounted with Mowiol 44-88 (Sigma) and observed with a spectral confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH). For detection of EGFP fusion proteins, cells were fixed, and coverslips were mounted and analyzed directly. For endoglin cross-linking experiments, HUVECs were grown onto 12-mm diameter glass coverslips coated with 0.5% of gelatin in 24-well cell culture plates. After 24 h, cells were incubated with mouse anti-endoglin P4A4 or anti-CD31 (Clone HC1/6, Chemicon) antibodies at 37 °C for 30 min. Then antibody-mediated clustering was induced by incubation with Alexa-488 anti-mouse IgG antibody, and actin filaments were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin as above. Identification of ZRP-1 as a LIM Domain Containing Protein Interacting with the Cytoplasmic Domain of Endoglin—To identify proteins that physically interact with the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin, we conducted a human lung cDNA library screen by the yeast two-hybrid method. We used a region of amino acids 612-658, which is the full cytoplasmic domain of l-endoglin, as a bait for the screen. From 1 × 106 initial transformants, 24 clones were found to confer both the His+ and LacZ+ phenotypes. These positive clones were subjected to secondary screening to eliminate false positives and to confirm the specific interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of endoglin and the protein encoded by a cDNA library within the yeast cells. Among the positive clones, we isolated one cDNA clone, named 130, encoding the C-terminal half of the LIM domain-containing zyxin-related protein-1, ZRP-1 (24Murthy K.K. Clark K. Fortin Y. Shen S.H. Banville D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20679-20687Google Scholar). Human ZRP-1 is a 476-amino acid protein containing three LIM domains in its C terminus and a proline-rich N-terminal segment that belongs to a new family of LIM proteins that includes zyxin (31Macalma T.

In the present study we examined Ca2+-dependent “cross-talk” between these two protein kinase families. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibitors and dominant-negative kinases (dnKinase), we identified a requirement for CaMKK acting through CaMKI in the stimulation of ERKs upon depolarization of the neuroblastoma cell line, NG108. Depolarization stimulated prolonged ERK and JNK activation that was blocked by the CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609; this inhibition of ERK activation by STO-609 was rescued by expression of a STO-609-insensitive mutant of CaMKK. However, activation of ERK by epidermal growth factor or carbachol were not suppressed by inhibition of CaMKK, indicating specificity for this “cross-talk.” To identify the downstream target of CaMKK that mediated ERK activation upon depolarization, dnKinases were expressed. The dnCaMKI completely suppressed ERK2 activation whereas dnAKT/PKB or nuclear-targeted dnCaMKIV, other substrates for CaMKK, were not inhibitory. ERK activation upon depolarization or transfection with constitutively active (ca) CaMKI was blocked by dnRas. Additionally, depolarization of NG108 cells promoted neurite outgrowth, and this effect was blocked by inhibition of either CaMKK (STO-609) or ERK (UO126). Co-transfection with caCaMKK plus caCaMKI also stimulated neurite outgrowth that was blocked by inhibition of ERK (UO126). These data are the first to suggest that ERK activation and neurite outgrowth in response to depolarization are mediated by CaMKK activation of CaMKI.

https://openalex.org/W2031569048,"cYes, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is highly expressed in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells. We demonstrate that cYes kinase activity is regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and serum and is down-regulated when cells differentiate. Moreover, selective chemical inhibition of Src family kinases decreases growth and expression of stem cell genes that mark the undifferentiated state, including Oct3/4, alkaline phosphatase, fibroblast growth factor 4, and Nanog. A synergistic effect on differentiation is observed when ES cells are cultured with an Src family inhibitor and low levels of retinoic acid. Src family kinase inhibition does not interfere with LIF-induced JAK/STAT3 (Janus-associated tyrosine kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) or p42/p44 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphorylation. Together the results suggest that the activation of the Src family is important for maintaining mouse and human ES in an undifferentiated state and may represent a third, independent pathway, downstream of LIF in mouse ES cells. cYes, a member of the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is highly expressed in mouse and human embryonic stem (ES) cells.

They can be expanded in culture and retain attributes of pluripotent cells of early embryos when reintroduced into the blastocyst. The capacity for multilineage differentiation can be reproduced in vitro, wherein ES cells can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell types (reviewed in Refs. 1Smith A.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Google Scholar and 2Keller G.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 862-869Google Scholar). There is currently considerable interest in the prospect of exploring this potential to provide a renewable source of material for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. One of the most important issues in stem cell biology is the mechanism that regulates self-renewal, a crucial aspect of stem cell function (reviewed in Ref. 3Niwa H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Google Scholar). The propagation of pluripotent mouse embryonic stem cells depends upon the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which activates gp130 via dimerization with the LIF-specific receptor subunit LIFRβ (4Smith A.G. Heath J.K. Donaldson D.D. Wong G.G. Moreau J. Stahl M. Rogers D. Nature. 1988; 336: 688-690Google Scholar, 5Williams R.L. Hilton D.J. Pease S. Willson T.A. Stewart C.L. Gearing D.P. Wagner E.F. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Gough N.M. Nature. 1988; 336: 684-687Google Scholar). Gp130 is known to activate the Janus-associated tyrosine kinases (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3, as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Several lines of evidence suggest that STAT3 activation is necessary and sufficient for maintaining ES cells in an undifferentiated state (6Niwa H. Burdon T. Chambers I. Smith A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2048-2060Google Scholar, 7Matsuda T. Nakamura T. Nakao K. Arai T. Katsuki M. Heike T. Yokota T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4261-4269Google Scholar), whereas the MAPK pathway antagonizes ES cell self-renewal partly because of a negative feedback on JAK activity (8Burdon T. Stracey C. Chambers I. Nichols J. Smith A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 30-43Google Scholar, 9Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Google Scholar). The overall balance of conflicting activation of STAT3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and 2, and MAPKs might determine the efficiency of ES self-renewal. The signals that maintain ES cells in an undifferentiated state are, however, not fully understood, and a recent report shows that bone morphogenetic proteins may act in combination with LIF to sustain self-renewal (10Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Chambers I. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 115: 281-292Google Scholar). There are a few genes whose functions are known to be essential for ES cell pluripotency, including the POU family transcription factor Oct3/4 (octamer binding protein 3 or 4 encoded by Pou5f1; reviewed in Ref. 3Niwa H. Cell Struct. Funct. 2001; 26: 137-148Google Scholar), which is down-regulated in response to differentiation. However, exogenous expression of Oct3/4 does not prevent ES cell differentiation induced by LIF withdrawal and a less than 2-fold increase in Oct3/4 expression causes differentiation, all of which suggests that there are other genes controlling ES cell maintenance and pluripotency (11Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Google Scholar). Recently, the homeo domain protein Nanog was shown to be capable of maintaining ES cell self-renewal independently of the LIF/STAT3 pathway (12Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Google Scholar, 13Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Google Scholar). In contrast to mouse ES (mES) cells, human ES (hES) cells do not seem to require LIF for maintenance in vitro. It has been suggested that the discrepancy between mouse and human ES cells may be due to the surface markers/receptors they express, whereas the downstream signaling pathways, such as the JAK/STAT3 pathway, may be conserved (14Rose-John S. Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 417-419Google Scholar). Our attention was drawn to the Src family after examining transcriptional profiles for mouse embryonic, hematopoietic, and neuronal stem cells, which showed that mRNA for the Src-family member, cYes, is enriched in all of these stem cell populations compared with their differentiated counterparts. Notably, the enrichment of cYes transcripts is most pronounced in ES cells (15Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Google Scholar, 16Ivanova N.B. Dimos J.T. Schaniel C. Hackney J.A. Moore K.A. Lemischka I.R. Science. 2002; 298: 601-604Google Scholar). The Src family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases regulates diverse processes such as cell division, motility, adhesion, differentiation, and survival (17Kefalas P. Brown T.R. Brickell P.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 27: 551-563Google Scholar, 18Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Google Scholar, 19Summy J.M. Gallick G.E. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 337-358Google Scholar). The Src family has also been implicated in the maintenance of ES cells by the fact that LIF activates the Src family member Hck (20Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Google Scholar), and expression of kinase active mutants of Src and Hck can maintain ES cells in an undifferentiated state when LIF concentrations are reduced but not absent (21Boulter C.A. Aguzzi A. Williams L.R. Wagner E.F. Evans M.J. Beddington R. Development. 1991; 111: 357-366Google Scholar, 22Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Google Scholar). What has not been determined heretofore is whether Src family members are necessary for ES cell maintenance of the undifferentiated state, nor have the downstream signaling pathways by which these kinases exert their effects been established. To address the role of the Src family, and in particular cYes, in ES cells, we investigated the endogenous activation and expression of cYes in undifferentiated mouse and human ES cells and in differentiated embryoid bodies (EBs). The results show that cYes protein is indeed highly expressed in mouse and human ES cells. cYes activity is regulated by LIF as well as one or more components present in serum. In addition, we used the selective Src family inhibitor SU6656 (23Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar) to show that the Src family is required for the maintenance of self-renewal in ES cells through a JAK/STAT3 and Ras/MAPK independent pathway. Materials—Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors: monoclonal anti-cYes, BD Transduction Laboratories; anti-phospho-Src (Tyr416) and anti-phospho-p44/p42 (Thr202/Tyr204) MAPK (ERK1/2) antibodies, Cell Signaling Technology; anti-p44/p42 MAPK (ERK1/2), anti-JAK1 (HR-785), anti-STAT3 (C-20), anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr705), and anti-Oct3/4 (sc-5279) antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; monoclonal anti-neuronal class III β-tubulin antibody, Covance Research Products; polyclonal anti-human α-1-fetoprotein (AFP) antibody, Dako; monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (G3G4), Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; and monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), Upstate Biotechnology. All-trans-retinoic acid was obtained from Sigma, and the SU6656 inhibitor was purchased from Calbiochem. Cells—Experiments were performed using the H1 mouse ES cell line derived from the 129sv strain (a kind gift from Andrew McMahon, Harvard University) passage 14–40. All results were confirmed in the C57Bl/6-derived ES cell line (a kind gift from Colin Stewart, NCI/National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD). Cells were cultured as described previously (15Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Google Scholar). The H9 human ES cell line, passage 19–40, was cultured as described previously (24Amit M. Carpenter M.K. Inokuma M.S. Chiu C.P. Harris C.P. Waknitz M.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Thomson J.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 271-278Google Scholar). All results were confirmed in two new hES cell lines (25Cowan C.A. Klimanskaya I. McMahon J. Atienza J. Witmyer J. Zucker J.P. Wang S. Morton C.C. McMahon A.P. Powers D. Melton D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 350: 1353-1356Google Scholar). Before stimulation with LIF or serum, the mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF)-depleted cells were cultured overnight in serum- and LIF-free ES media. The SU6656 inhibitor (2.5 mm stock in Me2SO) was added 30 min prior to LIF. Cell Number—20,000 ES cells/cm2 were plated on gelatin and cultured in ES media containing 500 pm LIF and different concentrations of SU6656, and the number of cells, as a percentage of the untreated control, were counted on day 4. Alkaline Phosphatase Staining—Cells were cultured for 6 days under different culture conditions and stained with the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Vector laboratories). The proportion of undifferentiated cells was determined by scoring at least 300 randomly chosen ES cell colonies. Colonies consisting entirely of densely packed alkaline phosphatase+ cells were scored as “undifferentiated,” whereas colonies consisting of a mixture of unstained and stained cells or entirely of unstained cells with flattened irregular morphology were considered “differentiated.” Cell Viability—The proportion of apoptotic cells was analyzed using the DeadEnd™ fluorometric terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) system (Promega) of trypsinized cells and flow cytometry according to the manufacturer's instructions. The proportion of necrotic cells was determined by staining live cells with 20 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 and 10 μg/ml propidium iodide for 5 min at 37 °C. Cells were then trypsinized, washed, and immediately subjected to analysis by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry and Immunohistochemistry for Oct3/4—Mouse ES cells, cultured for 8 days with different treatments, were trypsinized, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 + 5% donkey serum in PBS for 30 min followed by incubation with monoclonal Oct3/4 antibody (1:200) overnight at 4 °C and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody (The Jackson Laboratory) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were re-suspended in 0.5 ml PBS + 1% FBS, filtered, and analyzed by flow cytometry using a triple laser MoFlo (Cytomation) using the Summit software. Immunohistochemistry—Mouse ES cells cultured under various conditions on gelatin-coated dishes were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 1% Triton X-100 and 2% Nonidet P-40 in PBS for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 15% donkey serum in PBS-T (0.2% Nonidet P-40 + 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 60 min. Cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-TUJ1 antibody (1:500) and a polyclonal anti-AFP antibody (1:500) overnight followed by incubation with a rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody and an FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Mouse ES cells cultured under various conditions on gelatin-coated dishes were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd for 20 min and fixed with paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with 4 N HCl in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min followed by several washes with PBS-T, and nonspecific binding was inhibited by incubation with 15% donkey serum in PBS-T. Cells were then incubated sequentially with a monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody (G3G4; 1:1000 diluted in blocking buffer) and an FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody. At least 1000 cells were counted to assess the percent BrdUrd-positive cells. Western Blot Analysis on Cell Lysates—Subconfluent cells were washed with cold PBS, briefly sonicated in SDS-sample buffer (containing β-mercaptoethanol and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and subjected to Western blot analysis. The membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies, and the immunoreactivity was subsequently detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoblot detection system (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Mouse ES cells cultured to sub-confluence on 10-cm dishes or equal amounts of EBs were lysed in 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μm orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.05 mm leupeptin, and the nuclei were removed by centrifugation. cYes was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of each of anti-Yes antibody and protein A-Sepharose and subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction by incubation in 30 μl of 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 7 μCi [γ32P]ATP for 15 min in room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 70 μl of SDS-sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting for cYes and phospho-Src (Tyr416) or autoradiography. Expressing Small Interfering RNAs (siRNA) in Mouse ES Cells— Expression of siRNA was achieved by transfection of pSilencer™ 1.0-U6 siRNA expression vector (Ambion) driving the expression of specific siRNA. Each construct was sequenced before transfection. The oligonucleotides designed for RNAi were as follows: 5′-GATGCGGAAAGATTACTTCTTCAAGAGAGAAGTAATCTTTCCGCATCTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAAGATGCGGAAAGATTACTTCTCTCTTGAAGAAGTAATCTTTCCGCATCGGCC-3′ (yes1); 5′-TTGCTACCGGAAAGAGTGGTTCAAGAGACCACTCTTTCCGGTAGCAATTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAATTGCTACCGGAAAGAGTGGTCTCTTGAACCACTCTTTCCGGTAGCAAGGCC-3′ (yes2); 5′-CGCATCTGGAAGCCTTTCCTTCAAGAGAGGAAAGGCTTCCAGATGCGTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAACGCATCTGGAAGCCTTTCCTCTCTTGAAGGAAAGGCTTCCAGATGCGGGCC-3′ (Nanog) and; 5′-GAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTCTTCAAGAGACTTCTTCAGCACGACGAAGTTTTTT-3′ and 5′-AATTAAAAAAGAAGCAGCACGACTTCTTCTCTCTTGAACTTCTTCAGCACGACGAAGGGCC-3′ (enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)). The siRNA constructs were co-transfected with a puro-GFP vector containing the chicken ā-actin (CBA) promoter driving the expression of bovine tau fused to GFP and linked to a puromycin-resistance gene by internal ribosome entry site (pTP6; a kind gift from Andrew McMahon, Harvard University) at a ratio of 1:20 using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (Invitrogen). The pDsRed2-N1 vector (Clontech) was used to express red fluorescent protein (RFP). Transfected cells were cultured in selection ES media supplemented with 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 14 days. Colonies were stained with alkaline phosphatase as described above, and the number of colonies as a percentage of control (EGFP siRNA-transfected cells) were counted. Semi-quantitive Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR and Real-time PCR—Total RNA, extracted from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion was subjected to RT-PCR as follows: 1–4 μg of RNA were converted to cDNA by the SuperScript™ first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Reactions not catalyzed by reverse transcriptase were run in parallel. 0.1–1 μl of the cDNA was added to each 25-μl PCR reaction using Taq polymerase (Promega) and the following primers: 5′-CCACAAAGGGAGCATCAGTT-3′ and 5′-GAATGGAATCTGCACGCACT-3′ (Yes); 5′-AGGGTCTGCTACTGAGATGCTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAACCACTGGTTTTTCTGCCACCG-3′ (Nanog); 5′-CTGAACAACGAACCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-TTGCTCTCTGAAGCCCTGTT-3′ (germ-cell nuclear factor (GCNF)); 5′-GGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATCC-3′ and 5′-ACGCACGATTTCCCTCTCAGC-3′ (β-actin); 5′-TGGATTGTTTGATTGATGTTTATGG-3′ and 5′-TGTTTGGGTTTGCTGTGAGG-3′ (cripto); 5′-GAGGCGTGGTGAGCATCTT-3′ and 5′-ACACTCGGTTCCCCTTCTTG-3′ (fibroblast growth factor (FGF)4); 5′-TGAAGCAGACAGCCAGAAACA-3′ and 5′-CAACAGACAGGGATTTGATAGGG-3′ (Dab2) and; 5′-AACTACAGGCATTGTTCTGG-3′ and 5′-TTATGTCACGGACAATTTCA-3′ (cardiac actin). Samples that had not been treated with reverse transcriptase were run in parallel to verify that the obtained PCR products were amplified cDNA with no contamination of genomic DNA (results not shown). Densitometric scannings of the PCR bands were performed using the object image 2.08 f software. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed on 0.1 μg of cDNA using the QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and DNA Engine Opticon (MJ Research) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Expression Levels and Kinase Activity of cYes in Mouse and Human ES Cells—To determine whether cYes protein expression or activity was regulated in ES cells under different conditions, Western blotting, and in vitro kinase assays were performed on undifferentiated mouse and human ES cells as well as on 10-day-old mouse and human EBs. As shown in Fig. 1A, cYes is highly active in both undifferentiated human and mouse ES cells, as assessed by autophosphorylation of cYes. cYes activity was significantly down-regulated when mouse ES cells differentiated and the decreased cYes activity could be detected as early as 4 days after LIF withdrawal. By contrast, the level of cYes protein was unchanged or only marginally reduced in mouse EBs cultured for up to 21 days in the absence of LIF (data not shown). To evaluate whether cYes is part of an LIF signal transduction pathway, as shown for Hck (20Ernst M. Gearing D.P. Dunn A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1574-1584Google Scholar, 22Ernst M. Oates A. Dunn A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30136-30143Google Scholar), mES cells were serum-starved overnight and stimulated with different concentrations of LIF for various periods of time. Cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated for cYes, and subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. cYes activity was stimulated by LIF in a dose-(Fig. 1B) and time-dependent (Fig. 1C) manner. The Western blots of immunoprecipitated cYes were probed with anti-cYes antibody and a phospho-specific antibody that binds the autophosphorylation site in cYes. These data confirm that LIF treatment increase autophosphorylation of cYes in vivo (Fig. 1E). Serum-starved mES cells treated with 15% FBS for 20 min also exhibited increased cYes kinase activity compared with untreated cells. The degree of cYes-activation in response to serum was similar to that following LIF activation (Fig. 1E). SU6656, at concentrations above 0.5 μm, inhibited the LIF-dependent activation of cYes in mES cells (Fig. 1D). The SU6656 inhibitor potently and selectively inhibits cYes, cSrc, Fyn, and Lyn of the Src family. In contrast to other frequently used Src family inhibitors, SU6656 does not inhibit non-Src family tyrosine kinases such as PDGFRβ, FGFR1, IGF1R, Met, Csk, Kit Bcr-Abl, or Cdk2, nor does it inhibit the Src family members Lck or Frk/Rak (23Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar, 26Tatton L. Morley G.M. Chopra R. Khwaja A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4847-4853Google Scholar). It is unclear whether SU6656 inhibits Hck kinase activity. In summary, cYes protein is easily detected in both mouse and human ES cells, and its kinase activity is activated by LIF and it is serum- and down-regulated when cells differentiate. The JAK1/STAT3 and Ras/MAPK Pathways Are Not Disrupted by Src Family Suppression in Mouse ES Cells—To assess if the JAK/STAT3 or MAPK pathways are activated downstream of the Src family in response to LIF, we treated mES cells with 5 μm SU6656 and/or LIF and studied the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT3. Treating cells with the kinase inhibitor mediated no immediate changes in LIF-induced STAT3 or JAK1 tyrosine phosphorylation, as assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-JAK1 or anti-STAT3 antibodies and blotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 2A). The data was confirmed by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-phospho Tyr705 STAT3 antibody (results not shown). Because it has been reported that high levels of SU6656 (20 μm) for a prolonged culture period (24 h) can reduce STAT3 activity in A549 lung cancer cells (27Song L. Turkson J. Karras J.G. Jove R. Haura E.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4150-4165Google Scholar), mES cells were cultured for 24 h in 0, 2, 5, or 20 μm SU6656, and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed (Fig. 2B). No detectable effects upon STAT3 phosphorylation or protein levels were observed when cells were treated with 2 μm SU6656, a concentration shown to efficiently inhibit Src family kinases. A reduction in the level of STAT3 phosphorylation, proportional to a concomitant decrease in total STAT3 protein levels, was observed when cells were cultured in 5 and 20 μm SU6656, concentrations that are toxic in ES cells (Fig. 2B and results not shown). Given that previous reports have shown that such high concentrations of SU6656 may induce unspecific inhibition of non-Src family kinases, we conclude that inhibition of the Src family does not affect the STAT3 pathway in ES cells. In addition, the Ras/MAPK pathway does not seem to operate downstream of the Src family proteins either, because the amount of Thr202/Tyr204-phosphorylated ERK in cell lysates was unaltered in cells treated with LIF and SU6656, compared with cells treated with LIF alone (Fig. 2C). The Src Family Is Required for ES Cell Self-renewal—To determine whether the Src family is necessary for maintaining ES cells in the undifferentiated state, mouse and human ES cells were treated with the selective kinase inhibitor SU6656 and cell differentiation was assessed. Mouse and human ES cells were cultured on MEFs for 6 days in ES media with 500 pm LIF and increasing concentration of SU6656 (Fig. 3B). Colonies were then stained for alkaline phosphatase (AP), as a marker for the undifferentiated state. Colonies consisting entirely of densely packed alkaline-positive cells were scored as undifferentiated, whereas colonies consisting of a mixture of unstained and stained cells or entirely of unstained cells with flattened irregular morphology were considered differentiated (fig. 3, E–G). As shown in Fig. 3B, mouse and human ES cells both exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the proportion of undifferentiated, AP-positive colonies in response to SU6656. The colonies exposed to SU6656 were also fewer and smaller, suggesting that the kinase inhibitor negatively affects cell growth (Fig. 3, E–G). The reduction in colony size due to SU6656 addition was found to result from diminished ES cell growth, as assessed by cell counting (results not shown). Mouse ES cells were cultured in gelatin-coated dishes for 6 days in increasing amounts of LIF (Fig. 3A). In accord with previous reports, LIF was required for mES cell self-renewal; ∼80% of the colonies were undifferentiated when cultured in 125 pm LIF, whereas less than 5% of the colonies were completely undifferentiated in the absence of LIF (Fig. 3A). Oct3/4 expression was analyzed in mES cells cultured for 8 days in various concentrations of LIF or with 500 pm LIF and increasing levels of SU6656. Although the decrease in Oct3/4 expression in response to differentiation is slower and less robust than that observed for alkaline phosphatase staining, immunohistochemistry and subsequent analysis by flow cytometry for Oct3/4 revealed a dose-dependent decrease in the number of Oct3/4+ cells in response to SU6656 (Fig. 3D), a result consistent with the notion that inhibition of Src family kinases leads to ES cell differentiation. Other genes expressed in undifferentiated ES cells, such as Nanog and FGF4 (12Chambers I. Colby D. Robertson M. Nichols J. Lee S. Tweedie S. Smith A. Cell. 2003; 113: 643-655Google Scholar, 13Mitsui K. Tokuzawa Y. Itoh H. Segawa K. Murakami M. Takahashi K. Maruyama M. Maeda M. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2003; 113: 631-642Google Scholar, 28Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Google Scholar), were also decreased in SU6656-treated mES cells, as determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3K). Furthermore, Src family inhibition increased the expression of GCNF, a gene that represses oct3/4 gene activities in differentiating cells (29Fuhrmann G. Chung A.C. Jackson K.J. Hummelke G. Baniahmad A. Sutter J. Sylvester I. Scholer H.R. Cooney A.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1 (A. J. C.): 377-387Google Scholar). Samples not treated with reverse transcriptase were run in parallel to control for contaminating genomic DNA. These controls did not yield any detectable PCR product (results not shown). To assess the mechanisms by which SU6656 inhibits ES cell growth, mouse and human ES cells were cultured in increasing concentrations of SU6656 inhibitor for 2 days, after which cell death (Fig. 3L) and BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3M) was determined. Src family inhibition caused a moderate, dose-dependent decrease in DNA synthesis and cell viability. A change in proliferation of ES cells may be related to a move from the undifferentiated state, because retinoic acid (RA) induces similar effects on ES cell growth (results not shown). Thus, we conclude that the loss of self-renewal by Src family inhibition is not a consequence of massive cell death or a complete block in the cell cycle, but rather it is due to a combined partial effect upon both of these occurring in conjunction with differentiation. Expression of yes siRNA Induces Differentiation and Reduces the Ability to Generate Stable ES Cell Clones—To specifically establish the role of the Src family member cYes in self-renewal of mES cells, down-regulation of cYes gene expression was achieved by RNA interference. Two different siRNA constructs for yes were designed and inserted immediately downstream of the U6 polymerase III promoter of the pSilencer™ vector. siRNA for EGFP and siRNA for nanog were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Transient transfection of mES cells with a mixture of plasmids expressing GFP, RFP, and EGFP siRNA induced a specific reduction in the GFP signal but did not affect the RFP signal (Fig. 4A). Moreover, yes siRNA mediated a reduction in yes mRNA as determined by RT-PCR of GFP-sorted cells (Fig. 4C). Yes siRNA also reduced the expression of Nanog mRNA and increased the expression of GCNF, suggesting that cYes is important for maintaining mES cells in an undifferentiated state. Cells transfected with nanog siRNA exhibited reduced Nanog mRNA 2 days after transfection (Fig. 4B). To generate stable siRNA-e"

Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) belongs to the family Bunyaviridae and is transmitted by arthropods. We have recently identified the nonstructural protein NSs of BUNV as a virulence factor that inhibits Ifn-β gene expression in the mammalian host. Here, we demonstrate that NSs targets the RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) complex. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAP II consists of 52 repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. Phosphorylation at serine 5 is required for efficient initiation of transcription, and subsequent phosphorylation at serine 2 is required for mRNA elongation and 3′-end processing. In BUNV-infected mammalian cells, serine 5 phosphorylation occurred normally. Furthermore, RNAP II was able to bind to the Ifn-β gene promoter as revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, indicating that the initiation of transcription was not disturbed by NSs. However, NSs prevented CTD phosphorylation at serine 2, suggesting a block in transition from initiation to elongation. Surprisingly, no interference with CTD phosphorylation was observed in insect cells. Our results indicate that BUNV uses an unconventional mechanism to block Ifn synthesis in the mammalian host by directly dysregulating RNAP II. Moreover, by inducing a general transcriptional block, NSs may contribute to the lytic infection observed in mammalian cells as opposed to persistent infection in the insect host.

Kerr I.M. Williams B.R. Silverman R.H. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Google Scholar). The induction of Ifn gene expression is best understood for Ifn-β. The Ifn-β promoter has binding sites for the stress-activated transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 and for the Ifn regulatory factors IRF-3 and IRF-7. These factors normally reside in the cytoplasm. Upon activation by virus infection or double-stranded RNA, they move to the nucleus and associate with RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) to initiate transcription of the Ifn-β gene (2Goodbourn S. Didcock L. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2341-2364Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Garcia-Sastre A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 143-156Google Scholar). During the transcription cycle, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAP II is reversibly phosphorylated (4Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the CTD is composed of 52 repeats of the consensus sequence YSPTSPS. RNAP II containing unphosphorylated CTD is recruited to the promoter (5Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13165-13173Google Scholar), whereas the CTD hyperphosphorylated form is involved in active transcription (6Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6693-6698Google Scholar). Phosphorylation occurs at two sites within the heptapeptide repeat, at serine 5 and serine 2. Serine 5 phosphorylation is confined to promoter regions and is necessary for the initiation of transcription, whereas serine 2 phosphorylation is important for mRNA elongation and 3′-end processing (7Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 67-76Google Scholar, 8Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Google Scholar, 9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S.

Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). Viruses have evolved numerous mechanisms for evading the Ifn system. Specific viral gene products have been identified that inhibit either Ifn synthesis, Ifn signaling, or Ifn action and are therefore referred to as Ifn antagonists (2Goodbourn S. Didcock L. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2341-2364Google Scholar, 3Levy D.E. Garcia-Sastre A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 143-156Google Scholar, 12Weber F. Kochs G. Haller O. Staeheli P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2003; 23: 209-213Google Scholar). Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) is a member of the family Bunyaviridae, representing a large group of negative strand RNA viruses that are mainly transmitted by arthropods (13Elliott R.M. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, London1999: 212-216Google Scholar). Several bunyaviruses cause encephalitis or hemorrhagic fevers in humans, e.g. the Hantaan virus, the Sin Nombre virus, the Rift Valley fever virus, the La Crosse virus, and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (14Weber F. Elliott R.M. Virus Res. 2002; 88: 129-136Google Scholar). Like other arboviruses, BUNV can replicate both in mammals and insects. Depending on the host, however, the outcome of infection is different. In mammalian cells, infection is lytic and causes host cell shutoff and cell death. In insect cells, however, infection is non-cytolytic and leads to long-term viral persistence (15Gonzalez-Scarano F. Nathanson N. Fields B.N. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1473-1504Google Scholar, 16Rossier C. Raju R. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1988; 165: 539-548Google Scholar, 17Scallan M.F. Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 53-60Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that the nonstructural NSs protein of BUNV acts as an Ifn antagonist (18Weber F. Bridgen A. Fazakerley J.K. Streitenfeld H. Randall R.E. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7949-7955Google Scholar). A mutant virus with a deleted NSs gene (BUNdelNSs virus) was generated (19Bridgen A. Weber F. Fazakerley J.K. Elliott R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 664-669Google Scholar) and found to be highly attenuated in immunocompetent mice. However, in mice with a defective Ifn system this NSs-deficient virus was as virulent as the wild-type virus (wt BUNV). Further analyses revealed that NSs inhibited transcriptional activation of the Ifn-β gene without interfering with the activation of IRF-3 (18Weber F. Bridgen A. Fazakerley J.K. Streitenfeld H. Randall R.E. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7949-7955Google Scholar, 20Kohl A. Clayton R.F. Weber F. Bridgen A. Randall R.E. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7999-8008Google Scholar). These findings suggested that NSs blocks a transcriptional step downstream of IRF-3. Here, we further investigated the mechanism and show that NSs inhibits a basic process in host cell gene transcription by targeting the CTD of RNAP II. Cells and Viruses—Simian VeroE6 cells and human 293 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells were maintained at 33 °C in L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% tryptose phosphate broth (Difco). The wt BUNV and the BUNdelNSs virus stocks used in this study were plaque-purified in BHK-21 cells, and working stocks were grown in VeroE6 cells as described (21Watret G.E. Pringle C.R. Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1985; 66: 473-482Google Scholar). Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies H5 and H14 (Covance) specifically recognize phosphoserine 2 and 5, respectively, on the CTD (22Patturajan M. Schulte R.J. Sefton B.M. Berezney R. Vincent M. Bensaude O. Warren S.L. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4689-4694Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) recognizes the N terminus of the large subunit of RNAP II. Rabbit polyclonal serum against the N protein of BUNV has been described previously (23Weber F. Dunn E.F. Bridgen A. Elliott R.M. Virology. 2001; 281: 67-74Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma) and a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Sigma) were used to detect the FLAG epitope. Rabbit polyclonal antibody FL-425 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) recognizes IRF-3. Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated goat antisera (Alexis) were used as secondary antibodies, and mouse monoclonal antibody B-10 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), which recognizes protein kinase R, was used as an IgG control. Plasmids—The firefly luciferase (FF-Luc) reporter constructs for monitoring Ifn-β promoter activation (p-125Luc) and NF-kB activity (p55A2-Luc) were kindly provided by Takashi Fujita, Tokyo, Japan (24Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Google Scholar). The FF-Luc reporter plasmid for AP-1 activity was purchased from Stratagene. The FF-Luc plasmid containing the Herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter was kindly provided by Stephen Goodbourn, London, United Kingdom (25King P. Goodbourn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8699-8704Google Scholar). Plasmid pRL-SV40 (Promega) contains the Renilla luciferase gene under control of the constitutive simian virus 40 promoter. The plasmid constructs pCDNA-CTRL (expressing a short fragment of the human MxA protein), pCDNA-FLAG-CTRL, pCDNA-BUNV NSs, pCDNA-FLAG-BUNV NSs, and pTM-F-BUNV NSs (23Weber F. Dunn E.F. Bridgen A. Elliott R.M. Virology. 2001; 281: 67-74Google Scholar) contain the appropriate cDNA sequences under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter (pCDNA backbone) or the T7 promoter (pTM backbone), respectively. Reporter Assays—Subconfluent monolayers of 293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg expression plasmid in 200 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) containing 2 μl of DAC-30 (Eurogentec). After 5 h at 37 °C, the liposome-DNA mixture was removed, and cells were treated with a specific inducer (10 μg of the synthetic double-stranded RNA poly(I·C) (Sigma) prepared with 10 μlof DAC-30 liposomes, 50 pg/ml tumor necrosis factor α (Sigma), or 1 mm N6-benzoyl-cAMP (Calbiochem)) or left untreated. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). An aliquot of 20 μl of lysate was used to measure luciferase activities as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Western Blot and Immunofluorescence Analyses—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor; Roche Applied Science) and phosphatase inhibitors (phosphatase inhibitor mixture II; Calbiochem). A total of 10 μg protein was separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel by electrophoresis and blotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) following the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with a 1:500 dilution of mouse antibodies H5 or H14 or rabbit anti-BUNV N serum. Protein bands were visualized using the ECL Plus method (Amersham Biosciences). For immunofluorescence analysis, cells were grown on coverslips to 30–50% confluency and transfected or infected as indicated. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with the primary antibodies polyclonal rabbit anti-BUNV N and mouse H5 or H14 diluted 1:1000 and 1:200 in PBS, respectively. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS and then treated with the secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 each. Cells were again washed three times in PBS and mounted using Fluorsave solution (Calbiochem). Stained cell samples were examined using a Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope with a 63× NA1.4 objective. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed essentially as described by the protocol accompanying the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, 107 human 293 cells, previously infected for 8 h, were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in culture medium containing 1% formaldehyde. Cells were then washed with PBS and collected by scraping with 2 ml of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were then sonicated with a Branson sonifier 250 (10 × 10 pulses with power set to 10 and duty cycle set to 90) to yield chromatin fragments of ∼500 bp. The sonicated extracts were diluted 1:10 in dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 0.167 m NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 0.01% SDS, and 1.1% Triton X-100) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors and precleared for 1 h at 4° with 80 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads saturated with salmon sperm DNA. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out with the appropriate antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were isolated by incubation with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose/salmon sperm DNA for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed successively in low salt immune complex buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100), high salt immune complex buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0,1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1% deoxycholate), and TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 1 mm EDTA). Proteins were eluted by incubating the beads two times in 250 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 100 mm NaHCO3), and cross-links were reversed by adding 20 μl of 5 m NaCl to the combined eluates (500 μl) and incubating at 65 °C for 4 h. To remove the proteins, 10 μl of protease K buffer was added (0.5 m EDTA, 20 μlof1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and 2 μl of 10 mg/ml protease K) followed by incubation for 1 h at 45 °C. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated using 5 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science) as carrier, and dissolved in 20 μl of H2O. Input and precipitated DNAs were analyzed by PCR using primers specific for the human Ifn-β promoter from nucleotides –138 to –19 (26Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Google Scholar). NSs Represses Reporter Gene Expression in a Promoter-independent Manner—We investigated the effect of NSs on RNAP II transcription using reporter assays. Cells in parallel dishes were transfected with an NSs-expressing cDNA construct together with various reporter plasmids containing the FF-Luc or Renilla luciferase genes under control of different inducible or constitutively active promoters. To activate the inducible promoters, cells were treated with either double-stranded RNA (Ifn-β promoter), TNF-α (NF-κB-inducible promoter), or cyclic AMP (AP-1-inducible promoter). After overnight incubation, luciferase activity was determined as a measure of promoter stimulation. As expected, NSs inhibited induction of the Ifn-β promoter, whereas a control construct (CTRL) encoding a polypeptide of a similar size as that of NSs had no effect (Fig. 1A, columns 1 and 2). Interestingly, NF-κB- and AP-1-inducible promoter activity was similarly blocked by NSs. (Fig. 1A, columns 3–6). Surprisingly, the constitutively active thymidine kinase promoter and the simian virus 40 immediate early promoter were also inhibited (Fig. 1B), indicating that NSs had a general effect on cellular transcription. It should be noted that, in these experiments, the expression of NSs was under the control of the CMV immediate early promoter. This resulted in almost undetectable levels of NSs (Fig. 1C, right panel), presumably due to autocrine self-inhibition. In contrast, the CTRL protein was expressed from the same vector to high amounts, as expected (Fig 1C, left panel). Thus, even small amounts of NSs seem to be able to repress transcription from cellular or viral RNAP II promoters. NSs Targets the C-terminal Domain of the Mammalian RNA Polymerase II—CTD phosphorylation plays a central role in the regulation of RNAP II (4Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Google Scholar, 11Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether NSs would affect the phosphorylation of the CTD heptapeptide at serine 5 or serine 2. Cells were infected with either the wt BUNV or the NSs-deficient BUNdelNSs virus or were left uninfected. At 6 h after infection, cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. Fig. 2A (panel 1) shows that infection with either wt BUNV or BUNdelNSs did not change CTD phosphorylation on serine 5. By contrast, phosphorylation on serine 2 was strongly reduced in wt BUNV-infected cells but not in BUNdelNSs-infected cells (Fig. 2A, panel 2). We also determined the overall amount of RNAP II in infected cells by using an antiserum that recognizes the N terminus of the RNAP II large subunit. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A (panel 3), infection with wt BUNV shifted the distribution of the RNAP II CTD from the hyper- to the hypophosphorylated state (Fig. 2A, IIo and IIa, respectively), in agreement with the observed reduction in CTD phosphorylation. The overall levels of RNAP II, however, were comparable between cells infected with either virus. Immunostaining for the viral N protein showed that the cell cultures were infected with similar efficiencies, irrespective of whether the wild-type or the mutant virus was used (Fig. 2A, panel 4). In summary, these data demonstrate that infection with wt BUNV reduces CTD serine 2 phosphorylation without affecting CTD serine 5 phosphorylation or the overall levels of RNAP II. To examine this finding at the single-cell level, we performed double immunofluorescence analyses using the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. Again, no major changes were detected for CTD phosphoserine 5 (Fig. 2B, upper panel), whereas the phosphoserine 2-specific signal disappeared in wild-type BUNV-infected cells but not in cells infected with the delNSs mutant (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The only difference between wt BUNV and the BUNdelNSs virus is their capacity to express NSs. We therefore argued that NSs was most likely responsible for the observed effect on CTD phosphorylation. To verify this hypothesis, we expressed recombinant NSs from appropriate plasmids. To bypass the suppressive effect of NSs on RNAP II-driven promoters (see Fig. 1C), we used a T7 system for NSs expression. Cells were transfected with a FLAG-NSs construct containing a T7 promoter, infected with an MVA-T7 helper virus, and fixed and stained at 6 h post-infection. Fig. 3A shows that T7-mediated expression of NSs indeed resulted in much higher protein levels than did CMV-driven expression, which is in agreement with our hypothesis that NSs inhibits the RNAP II. Furthermore, in cells expressing FLAG-NSs the phosphorylation of both serine 5 (Fig. 3, panels 1–3) and serine 2 (Fig. 3, panels 4–6) was barely detectable, whereas the surrounding untransfected cells were not affected. By contrast, parallel immunostainings with an antiserum that recognizes the N terminus of the RNAP II large subunit did not detect any major changes in RNAP II levels (Fig. 3, panels 7–9), indicating that NSs does not simply induce RNAP II degradation (compare Fig. 2A). Taken together, these data suggest that NSs represses RNAP II (but not T7 polymerase) by down-regulating the CTD phosphorylation. The main target appears to be phosphoserine 2. However, phosphoserine 5 was also affected in cells overexpressing recombinant NSs. In line with this, wt BUNV but not BUNdelNSs inhibited both serine 5 and serine 2 phosphorylation late in infection (data not shown). Subcellular Localization of NSs—In the T7 RNA polymerase-mediated high expression system, NSs was found to accumulate mainly in the nucleus (Fig. 3), whereas in the CMV promoter-mediated low expression system, NSs was detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 C). To investigate a possible relationship between NSs expression levels and intracellular localization, we monitored the subcellular distribution of NSs at different time points after the onset of expression by using the T7 system. Cells were transfected with the T7-FLAG-NSs construct, infected with MVA-T7 helper virus, and fixed and stained at 2 and 6 h post-infection. At 2 h after the onset of expression, NSs formed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, left panel) similar to the pattern observed with CMV promoter-driven expression (see Fig. 1C). In addition, minor amounts of NSs were localized in the nucleus, as indicated by a faint nuclear staining. At 6 h after the onset of expression, NSs was mainly nuclear, and the cytoplasm showed a faint and more uniform staining (Fig. 4, right panel). This staining pattern was also observed at later time points (data not shown). Because NSs in the CMV promoter-driven expression system was cytoplasmic even 24 h after transfection, we conclude that the subcellular localization of NSs depends on the expression levels, i.e. low amounts of NSs result in a mainly cytoplasmic, punctate pattern, whereas higher amounts localize to the nucleus. CTD Phosphorylation in Insect Cells—Most bunyaviruses have the ability to replicate both in mammals and in arthropods (13Elliott R.M. Granoff A. Webster R.G. Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, London1999: 212-216Google Scholar). Infection of mammalian cells is lytic and results in a shutoff of host cell protein synthesis, whereas insect cells are persistently infected without deleterious effects on cell function (15Gonzalez-Scarano F. Nathanson N. Fields B.N. Virology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, New York1996: 1473-1504Google Scholar, 16Rossier C. Raju R. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1988; 165: 539-548Google Scholar, 17Scallan M.F. Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 53-60Google Scholar). This difference in the outcome of infection is not easily explained, especially because NSs is expressed in BUNV-infected mosquito cells (17Scallan M.F. Elliott R.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 53-60Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NSs also affects CTD phosphorylation in insect cells. C6/36 mosquito cells were infected for 24 h, and CTD serine phosphorylation was investigated by immunofluorescence analyses. No apparent difference in serine 5 phosphorylation was observed between wt BUNV-infected and uninfected cells (Fig. 5, panels 1 and 2). Similarly, CTD serine 2 phosphorylation was unaffected (Fig. 5, panels 4 and 5). Infection with the BUNdelNSs virus also did not impair CTD phosphorylation, as expected (Fig. 5, panels 3 and 6). These results imply that NSs does not target the CTD of RNAP II in insect cells, allowing cell survival and persistent infection. Promoter Binding by RNAP II—Current models of RNAP II transcription postulate that CTD phosphorylation at serine 5 is confined to promoter regions and is necessary for initiating mRNA synthesis (8Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Google Scholar, 9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Google Scholar, 11Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). Subsequent phosphorylation at serine 2 is required for mRNA elongation and 3′-end processing. We determined the promoter binding capacity of RNAP II in infected cells using ChIP assays. We focused on the Ifn-β promoter because the biological function of NSs is to block the antiviral Ifn-α/β system (18Weber F. Bridgen A. Fazakerley J.K. Streitenfeld H. Randall R.E. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7949-7955Google Scholar). Cells were infected with wt BUNV or the BUNdelNSs virus or were left uninfected. At 8 h after infection, protein-DNA complexes were cross-linked with formaldehyde, cells were lysed, and the lysates were sonicated to obtain short DNA fragments. Phospho-CTD-specific antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate RNAP II-DNA complexes. After removing the proteins, the DNA in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by PCR amplification for the presence of Ifn-β promoter sequences. A positive PCR signal would indicate that the phosphorylated RNAP II had bound to the Ifn-β promoter. Fig. 6A (panel 1) shows that usage of the phospho-CTD serine 5-specific antibody resulted in a PCR product in all cases, irrespective of whether the cells were left uninfected or were infected with wt BUNV or the BUNdelNSs virus. By contrast, no signal was obtained in control experiments with an irrelevant antibody (Fig. 6A, panel 3). The input control showed that equal amounts of DNA were used (Fig. 6A, panel 4). These data indicate that the binding of serine 5-phosphorylated RNAP II to the Ifn-β promoter occurred unimpeded in infected cells and suggest that NSs affects a step after RNAP II has bound to the promoter. We also tested whether the bound RNAP II was phosphorylated at serine 2. As expected, in wt BUNV-infected cells no PCR signal was detected. In contrast, a strong signal was detectable in cells infected with the NSs-deficient mutant, indicating serine 2-phosphorylation of RNAP II (Fig. 6A, panel 2). Although in uninfected cells the Ifn-β gene is inactive, we detected CTD-phosphorylated RNAP II bound to the Ifn-β promoter region (Fig. 6A, panels 1 and 2, compare lanes m and delNSs). Binding of fully phosphorylated RNAP II to the inactive Ifn-β promoter was also observed in human A549 cells and in mouse embryo fibroblasts (data not shown), ruling out cell-specific effects. To elucidate the differences between the uninduced and induced state of the Ifn-β promoter, we determined promoter binding of the Ifn-specific transcription factor IRF-3, again using ChIP assays. In uninfected cells, IRF-3 did not bind to the Ifn-β promoter (Fig. 6B, panel 1). By contrast, an IRF-3-specific signal was obtained in cells infected with either bunyavirus (Fig. 6B, panel 3). This result is in agreement with our previous finding that IRF-3 activation is not affected by NSs (20Kohl A. Clayton R.F. Weber F. Bridgen A. Randall R.E. Elliott R.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7999-8008Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that RNAP II can be fully phosphorylated and recruited to the Ifn-β promoter even in the absence of virus infection but requires IRF-3 for efficient transcriptional activity. Moreover, NSs affects RNAP II after it has bound to the promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that the Ifn antagonist NSs of BUNV profoundly impairs the function of the mammalian RNAP II. NSs targets a step in the cellular transcription cycle that occurs after the RNAP II has bound to the promoter. NSs inhibits phosphorylation of CTD residue serine 2 but not of CTD serine 5. As a consequence, RNAP II function is disturbed, leading to the down-regulation of host cell mRNA synthesis. CTD phosphorylation is required for the eukaryotic RNAP II to overcome rate-limiting steps in transcription. Serine 5 phosphorylation initiates transcription of a short mRNA fragment and recruitment of a capping enzyme (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Google Scholar), whereas the subsequent phosphorylation at serine 2 is important for mRNA elongation and 3′-end processing (7Ahn S.H. Kim M. Buratowski S. Mol.

Cell. 2004; 13: 55-65Google Scholar, 11Orphanides G. Reinberg D. Cell. 2002; 108: 439-451Google Scholar). Serine 5 phosphorylation is mainly mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 7, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIIH (9Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Google Scholar). The main kinase responsible for CTD serine 2 phosphorylation is called P-TEFb, a complex consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase 9 and cyclin T (27Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar). Recently, TLK-1 has been identified as a further serine 2-specific CTD kinase that is essential for transcription (28Han Z. Saam J.R. Adams H.P. Mango S.E. Schumacher J.M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1921-1929Google Scholar). After termination of trans"

https://openalex.org/W1965078913,"Epithelial cells require adhesion to the extracellular matrix for survival, and in the absence of adhesion they undergo apoptosis (anoikis). This is distinct from apoptosis induced by extracellular death ligands, such as tumor necrosis factor, which result in direct activation of caspase 8. Bid is a member of the BH3-only subfamily of the Bcl-2 proteins and is important for most cell types to apoptose in response to Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor activation. Caspase 8 cleaves full-length Bid, resulting in truncated p15 tBid. p15 tBid is potently apoptotic and activates the multidomain Bcl-2 protein, Bax, resulting in release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. We have previously shown that Bax rapidly translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria following loss of adhesion and that this is required for anoikis. We have now examined the role of Bid in anoikis. Bid translocates to mitochondria with identical kinetics as Bax. Although Bid is required for anoikis, it does not require proteolytic cleavage by caspase 8. Furthermore, it does not require Bid to interact directly with other Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bax. Our data indicate that Bid is important for regulating apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway and has implications for how Bid may fulfill that role.

The Bcl-2 family of proteins are important regulators of programmed cell death (1Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Google Scholar). The family consists of members that are either anti-apoptotic (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) or proapoptotic (e.g. Bax and Bak) and are characterized by sharing up to four Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; OMM, outer mitochondrial membrane; ECM, extracellular matrix; PI, phosphatidylinositol; FL, full-length; WT, wild type; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyketone; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DN, dominant negative; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small inhibitory RNA; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein. domains. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL share BH domains 1-4, whereas pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak have only domains 1-3. The exact mechanism by which these molecules induce apoptosis is still unclear, but they appear to regulate permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), causing release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c (2Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Google Scholar, 3Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R71-R73Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic Bax and Bak are absolutely essential for this, and cells deficient in both of these are resistant to a wide variety of cellular insults (4Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). A subset of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins have only the BH3 domain and are referred to as the BH3-only proteins (5Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins sense diverse death stimuli and regulate the activity of multidomain Bcl-2 proteins, such as Bax. For example, Bim is regulated at a transcriptional level downstream of cytokine and growth factor receptors, whereas NOXA and PUMA are expressed in response to p53 activation (6Shinjyo T. Kuribara R.

Others are regulated post-translationally, such as Bad, which is phosphorylated downstream of growth factor receptors, sequestering it in the cytosol through interactions with 14-3-3 proteins (9Zha J.P. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Google Scholar). Bid, another BH3-only protein, has a role in apoptosis initiated by the extrinsic pathway (10Esposti M.D. Apoptosis. 2002; 7: 433-440Google Scholar). Engagement of death receptors (e.g. Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptor) results in activation of caspase 8, which cleaves Bid at Asp59 to produce a truncated Bid (tBid) (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar). Inhibition of Bid cleavage blocks apoptosis in response to death receptor activation in most cells (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 12Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Google Scholar). tBid translocates to mitochondria where it mediates cytochrome c release through activation of Bax and Bak. Cells deficient in Bax and Bak are resistant to tBid-induced apoptosis (4Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). tBid has been shown in vitro to induce a conformational change in Bax followed by its oligomerization and insertion into the OMM (13Desagher S. Osen S.A.

Therefore, activation of Bid may be one mechanism by which Bax is induced to initiate OMM permeabilization. In this paper we have examined the role of Bid in apoptosis mediated by the intrinsic pathway. Epithelial cells depend on interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) via integrins for survival, and detachment from ECM results in apoptosis referred to as anoikis (16Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Google Scholar). Anoikis is required to ensure cells only survive within their proper context in a particular tissue. Adhesion-dependent kinases provide a strong survival signal, although different cell types utilize different downstream pathways (17Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Google Scholar, 18Ilic D. Almeida E.A.C. Schlaepfer D.D. Dazin P. Aizawa S. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 547-560Google Scholar, 19Almeida E.A. Ilic D. Han Q. Hauck C.R. Jin F. Kawakatsu H. Schlaepfer D.D. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 741-754Google Scholar). Signaling molecules implicated include pp125FAK, PI 3-kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase. A number of BH3-only proteins are regulated by these pathways, including Bad, Bim, and Bid. Bim has been suggested to be involved in anoikis in MCF10A cells (20Reginato M.J. Mills K.R. Paulus J.K. Lynch D.K. Sgroi D.C. Debnath J. Muthuswamy S.K. Brugge J.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 733-740Google Scholar). Expression of Bim increased over 24-48 h following detachment from ECM, concomitant with the down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor. Indeed, Bim appears to be more closely regulated by growth factor signaling than other forms of cellular insults, and it is not clear whether Bim was directly regulated by adhesion signals (6Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Google Scholar, 21Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M.

Translocation of Bax to mitochondria occurs within 15-30 min of detachment, too rapid to be explained by the up-regulation of Bim expression. Furthermore, anoikis does not require new protein synthesis, indicating that pro-apoptotic proteins that are transcriptionally regulated are unlikely to have a central role in this process (23Wang P. Valentijn A.J. Gilmore A.P. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19917-19925Google Scholar). A number of studies have implicated death receptor activation and subsequent activation of caspase 8 as an initiating event for anoikis (24Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Google Scholar, 25Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Google Scholar). Detachment from ECM also leads to an increase in Fas expression on endothelial cells, making them sensitive to FasL (26Aoudjit F. Vuori K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 633-644Google Scholar). Alternatively, in adherent endothelial cells, unligated integrins can directly activate caspase 8 (27Stupack D.G. Puente X.S. Boutsaboualoy S. Storgard C.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 459-470Google Scholar). We have shown that anoikis of epithelial cells does not require activation of caspase 8 and that translocation of Bax, its N-terminal conformational change, and cytochrome c release all occur in a caspase-independent manner (17Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Google Scholar, 23Wang P. Valentijn A.J. Gilmore A.P. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19917-19925Google Scholar, 28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). We have now studied the subcellular localization of Bid during anoikis of mammary epithelial cells. We show that Bid rapidly translocates to mitochondria following cell detachment from ECM and that this occurs in the absence of proteolytic cleavage. Full-length (FL)-Bid in which the caspase 8 cleavage site was mutated (D59E BID) translocates to mitochondria in an identical manner as WT-Bid. Furthermore, translocation of Bid appears to be required for anoikis but does not require a direct interaction with other Bcl-2 proteins on the OMM. Together, our data suggest that endogenous FL-Bid can be activated into a pro-apoptotic form in the absence of caspase cleavage and that this may have a role in the intrinsic cell death pathway. Reagents—Polyclonal goat anti-Bid, rabbit anti-Bad, and recombinant tBid were from R & D Systems. Rabbit anti-actin and anti-Bak were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-Bcl-XL was from BD Biosciences. Rabbit anti-GFP was from Molecular Probes. Monoclonal anti-V5 was from Invitrogen. Monoclonal anti-mtHsp70 and anti-APAF1 were obtained from Affinity Bioreagents. The caspase inhibitors Z-VAD-fmk and IETD were from CN Biosciences. Human recombinant caspase 8 was from CN Biosciences. Poly-HEMA was from Sigma. Secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit, anti-goat, and anti-mouse peroxidase conjugates and anti-mouse Cy3 conjugates) were from Stratech Scientific. Expression Constructs—A murine Bid cDNA was amplified from a mouse embryo cDNA library with Pfu polymerase (Promega) using oligonucleotide primers to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding sequence, cloned into pCRScript (Stratagene), and confirmed by sequencing. To generate GFP-Bid and Bid-GFP, PCR primers were used that incorporated restriction endonuclease sites, and the product was ligated into either pEGFP-C3 or pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). pEYFP-Bax, pECFP-BclXL, pHcREd-XT, and pEYFP-XT have all been previously described (28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). All of the constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing and immunoblotting. To express V5-tagged Bid, Bid was subcloned into pCDNA6-V5-His (Invitrogen). The single amino acid substitutions were generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bid deletions were made using PCR. Cell Culture and Transfection—FSK-7 cells were cultured and transfected as previously described (17Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/cm2 on glass coverslips 18 h prior to transfecting with 0.5 μg of DNA in a 12-well tissue culture plate using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 18 h post-transfection, the cells were washed extensively with PBS. For detachment assays, the cells were trypsinized and replated onto 35-mm dishes coated with poly-HEMA (Sigma). The cells maintained on poly-HEMA were collected by centrifugation (5000 × g, 30 s). For immunostaining, the cells were resuspended in culture medium and centrifuged onto polysine slides (Merck) using a Cytospin cytological centrifuge (Shandon). For fractionation studies, the cells were resuspended into hypotonic buffer (see below). Adherent cells were scraped into hypotonic buffer. siRNA—The cells were transiently transfected as above with pSilencer 1.0U6 (Ambion) containing either a target sequence against bases 79-87 of the murine Bid coding sequence or a control sequence with an equivalent base content. Empty pSilencer was used as a further control. The cells were co-transfected with pEGFP.C3. The cells were cultured for 48 h post-transfection. For immunoblotting, the cells were trypsinized, washed extensively in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12, and sorted using a BD Biosciences FACS Vantage, using a 488-nm Argon laser. The collected cells were lysed into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For apoptosis assays, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto poly-HEMA-coated dishes for 5 h. They were then cytospun onto polysine slides (Merck), fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS, and nuclei-stained with Hoescht. Apoptosis was quantified in GFP-positive cells on the basis of nuclear morphology. Caspase 8 Cleavage of V5 Epitope-tagged Bid—FSK-7 cells were transfected as above, except with 1 μg of DNA on 50-mm tissue culture dishes. The cells were harvested 18 h post-transfection by scraping into ice-cold caspase digestion buffer (50 mm HEPES-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and protein concentration was estimated using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). 500 μg of cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of monoclonal anti-V5 and protein G-Sepharose (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing three times with digestion buffer, the immunocomplex was resuspended in 40 μl of the same buffer to which dithiothreitol was added to 10 mm. Human recombinant caspase 8 (1.5 units) was added and incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for Bid. Subcellular Fractionation—Adherent cells were scraped, and detached cells were collected by centrifugation (1200 × g, 3 min). Following several washes in ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm Na3VO4, 4mm NaF, the cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2) supplemented with 1 mm Na3VO4, 4 mm NaF, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem), and processed with a Dounce homogenizer on ice. NaCl was then added to a final concentration of 150 mm. The lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatant (s fraction) was saved, and the pellet (m fraction) was resuspended in an equal volume of 0.25% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl. After brief sonication, the CHAPS-extracted pellet was centrifuged as before, and the supernatant was saved. Protein concentration of the s fraction was determined using the BCA assay to normalize between samples. To compare soluble and membrane-associated proteins, equivalent amounts of s and m fractions were analyzed. Cell Fractionation and Chromatography—For gel filtration of CHAPS-extracted membrane fractions, 5 mg of protein in a volume of 0.5 ml was loaded onto a Sephacryl S100-HR column (1.5 × 25 cm; Amersham Biosciences; equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES-Cl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm CHAPS). The column was resolved at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. 0.8-ml fractions were collected. Calibration was with molecular mass standards from Sigma (12.4 kDa, cytochrome c; 29 kDa, carbonic anhydrase; 66 kDa, bovine serum albumin; 200 kDa, β-amylase; void volume, blue dextran). Column fractions were concentrated with trichloroacetic acid, separated by reducing SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and immunoblotted. Cross-linking—Following hypotonic lysis, the samples were incubated with 0.5 mm of the homobifunctional reagent BS3 (Pierce) for 30 min on ice. The reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, and fractionated as above. Cross-linked soluble and membrane fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Fluorescence Microscopy—The cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde/PBS. Cells expressing GFP and HcRed-tagged constructs were then mounted in ProLong (Molecular Probes) without further manipulation. Cells requiring immunostaining were permeabilized in PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% horse serum (1 h, 37 °C). Following washing in PBS, secondary anti-mouse Cy3 conjugates were incubated in above buffer (30 min, 37 °C). The cells were counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoescht 33258. The coverslips were mounted in ProLong. Most images were collected on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope using a 100× PLAN-APO 1.4NA objective, equipped with a DeltaVision imaging system. The images were processed by constrained iterative deconvolution on softWoRx, version 3.0 (Applied Precision). CFP and GFP co-expressing cells were viewed on an Leica SP2-AOBS confocal to separate the overlapping fluorophores. CFP was excited at 405 nm (>10% GFP excitation) using a blue diode laser and viewed at 425-450 nm. GFP was excited at 476 nm (>10% CFP excitation) using an argon laser and viewed at 530-575 nm. Full-length Bid Translocates to Mitochondria Rapidly during Anoikis—We have previously shown that mammary epithelial cells require adhesion to ECM for survival and that following detachment Bax translocates to mitochondria (17Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Google Scholar, 28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins function upstream to activate the multidomain proteins such as Bax. We therefore asked which BH3-only proteins become activated in response to cell detachment from ECM. FSK-7 mammary epithelial cells were detached from the ECM for various times before separating into cytosolic and membrane fractions. We found that Bid rapidly translocated to the membrane fraction following detachment (Fig. 1a). A small amount of Bid was detectable in the membrane fraction of adherent cells, but this significantly increased within 15 min of removing cells from ECM. Bid translocation preceded the detection of active caspase 3 in the cytosol. Fractions were immunoblotted for other Bcl-2 family proteins (Fig. 1b). As previously described, Bax also translocates to the membrane within 15 min (17Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A.M. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-445Google Scholar). Conversely, Bcl-XL and Bak are constitutively associated with the membrane fraction. The BH3-only protein, Bad, also did not show any significant redistribution following detachment (Fig. 1b). Bad is distributed between the membrane and cytosolic fraction. Translocation of Bid exclusively involves FL-Bid (Fig. 1c). At no point during anoikis did we observe significant amounts of 15-kDa tBid, either in the cytosol or membrane fractions. Prolonged exposure of the immunoblots clearly show that the vast majority of membrane associated Bid is full length. The size of tBid is indicated by the presence of 1 ng of recombinant tBid. To confirm that FL-Bid associates with mitochondria, we transiently expressed in cells Bid tagged with GFP, either at the C terminus (Bid-GFP) or at the N terminus (GFP-Bid) (Fig. 2a). Subcellular localization was determined by expression of HcRed-XT, an OMM marker consisting of the C-terminal domain of Bcl-XL (28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar, 29Kaufmann T. Schlipf S. Sanz J. Neubert K. Stein R. Borner C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 53-64Google Scholar). In adherent cells, both GFP-Bid and Bid-GFP show a diffuse, cytosolic distribution (Fig. 2b). However, following detachment, both forms of tagged Bid extensively co-localize with HcRed-XT. There is no co-localization between GFP and HcRed-XT in adherent or detached cells. Together, these data indicate that FL-Bid translocates rapidly to mitochondria following the detachment of cells from ECM. Bid Translocates Independently of Caspase Activation—Our recent data indicate that anoikis does not require activation of caspase 8. Inhibiting caspase 8 did not inhibit Bax translocation or the release of cytochrome c during anoikis (23Wang P. Valentijn A.J. Gilmore A.P. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19917-19925Google Scholar). However, some studies have suggested a role for death receptors and caspase 8 activation as an initiating event following cell detachment (24Rytomaa M. Martins L.M. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1043-1046Google Scholar, 25Frisch S.M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1047-1049Google Scholar). Given these conflicting data, we carried out a number of experiments to confirm that Bid translocation is independent of proteolytic cleavage. Cells were pretreated with either Z-VAD-fmk or caspase 8-specific IETD for 15 min before they were detached from ECM. We have previously shown that the concentration of Z-VAD-fmk used here inhibits anoikis in FSK-7 cells, although it does not prevent Bax translocation or cytochrome c release (23Wang P. Valentijn A.J. Gilmore A.P. Streuli C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19917-19925Google Scholar). Cytosolic and membrane fractions were isolated and immunoblotted for endogenous Bid (Fig. 3a). Neither caspase inhibitor prevented the translocation of endogenous Bid to the membrane fraction. Next, we made the conservative amino acid substitution D59E. Substitution of this site to either glutamate or alanine blocks caspase 8 cleavage (11Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Google Scholar, 30Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Google Scholar). WT-Bid and D59E-Bid were expressed with a C-terminal V5-epitope tag (BidV5), distinguishing them from endogenous Bid when transiently expressed in FSK-7 cells (Fig. 3b). D59E-Bid was resistant to cleavage by recombinant caspase 8 in vitro (Fig. 3b). We compared the ability of D59E and WT-BidV5 to translocate to mitochondria during anoikis. Transiently transfected cells were detached from ECM, and cytosolic and membrane fractions were isolated. These were immunoblotted for Bid (Fig. 3c). Both WT and D59E BidV5 translocate to the membrane fraction concomitant with endogenous Bid in the same samples. We examined the subcellular localization of WT and D59E BidV5 in cells co-expressing YFP-XT to mark the OMM (Fig. 3d). Both forms of BidV5 were cytosolic in adherent cells. Following detachment, both extensively co-localized with YFP-XT. Bid Regulates Anoikis in Mammary Epithelial Cells and Translocates Independently of Bax—We wished to determine whether FL-Bid was required for anoikis. A noncleavable mutant form of Bid sensitizes cells to a variety of apoptotic stimuli when overexpressed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (30Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Google Scholar). We asked whether transfection of either WT-Bid-V5 or D59E Bid-V5 sensitizes epithelial cells to anoikis. Cells transiently expressing either form of Bid were detached from ECM for 5 h. Apoptosis in V5-positive cells was quantified my nuclear morphology and compared with cells transfected with control vector (Fig. 4a). There was a small increase in apoptosis in adherent cells transfected with either form of Bid compared with control cells. However, detachment for 5 h indicated that both WT and D59E BidV5 sensitized cells to anoikis. There was no difference between WT-Bid or D59E BidV5 in the degree of sensitization. We next down-regulated endogenous Bid using siRNA. FSK-7 cells were transfected with either control pSilencer or pSilencer expressing siRNA targetted to murine Bid. The cells were co-transfected with pEGFP. 48 h post-transfection cells were either sorted by FACS for Western analysis (Fig. 4b) or detached from ECM and maintained on poly-HEMA for 5 h. The cells in which Bid expression had been knocked down showed a much reduced level of apoptosis following detachment compared with cells transfected with control pSilencer (Fig. 4c). Overexpression of Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 can block activation and translocation of Bax (31Finucane D.M. Bossy Wetzel E. Waterhouse N.J. Cotter T.G. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2225-2233Google Scholar, 32Yi X. Yin X.M. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16992-16999Google Scholar). We asked whether expression of Bcl-XL blocked the translocation of Bid during anoikis and its ability to sensitize cells to apoptosis. Cells co-expressing Bax, WTBidV5, or D59EBidV5, along with either GFP or GFP-Bcl-XL, were detached for 5 h, and apoptosis was quantified by nuclear morphology (Fig. 5a). GFP-Bcl-XL inhibited sensitization to anoikis because of overexpression of Bid or Bax. We then asked whether this was due to inhibition of Bid translocation. The cells were co-transfected with YFP-Bax or Bid-GFP, with or without CFP-Bcl-XL. The cells were detached from ECM for 30 min, and the localization of each was determined (Fig. 5b). In the absence of CFP-Bcl-XL, both YFP-Bax and Bid-GFP showed a punctate distribution in detached cells, distinct from the cytosolic distribution seen in adherent cells. However, although CFP-Bcl-XL inhibited the translocation of YFP-Bax, it did not block the redistribution of Bid-GFP. These data indicate that Bid translocation is independent of Bax relocalization to mitochondria. Both Bid and Bax are required, however, as our previous data from Bax null epithelial cells, which show delayed anoikis, indicates (28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). These cells express normal levels of Bid. 2A. J. Valentijn and A. P. Gilmore, unpublished data. The Ability of Bid to Regulate Anoikis Does Not Require a Direct Interaction with Other Bcl-2 Family Proteins—Bid can bind to a number of other Bcl-2 proteins, including Bax and Bcl-2 (33Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Google Scholar). However, although Bax enters large mitochondrial associated clusters following OMM permeabilization, Bid does not (34Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Lamensdorf I. Yoon S.H. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1265-1276Google Scholar). Bid can activate Bax, both in vitro and in vivo, but it remains unclear when, or indeed if, they interact. Most Bcl-2 proteins associate with other mitochondrial components and form stable complexes that can be isolated by gel filtration. Bax translocates to mitochondria as a monomer before forming stable oligomeric complexes (35Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Lauper S. Eskes R. Martinou J.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 271-278Google Scholar, 36Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Google Scholar, 37Valentine M.A. Licciardi K.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 3141-3148Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether Bid associated with other mitochondrial proteins following translocation to mitochondria and whether we could detect it in fractions that contained Bax. Soluble and membrane fractions were prepared from FSK-7 cells either in monolayer or maintained on poly-HEMA. The membrane fractions were then further extracted in CHAPS, and the CHAPS-insoluble material was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. All three fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for Bax and Bid (Fig. 6a). Bax becomes associated with a CHAPS-insoluble fraction during anoikis (28Valentijn A.J. Metcalfe A.D. Kott J. Streuli C.H. Gilmore A.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 599-612Google Scholar). This did not occur with Bid, which was completely extracted by CHAPS at all stages of anoikis. The CHAPS-soluble fractions were subjected to S100 chromatography, separated by SDS-PAGE,"

The phosphorylation of Period (Per) proteins by CK1ϵ is believed to be implicated in their subcellular localization and degradation, but the precise mechanism by which CK1ϵ affects Per proteins has not been determined. In this study, three putative CK1ϵ phosphorylation motif clusters in mouse Per1 (mPer1) were identified, and the phosphorylation status of serine and threonine residues in these clusters was examined. Phosphorylation of residues within a region defined by amino acids 653–663 and in particular of Ser-661 and Ser-663, was identified as responsible for the nuclear translocation of mPer1. Furthermore, phosphorylation of these residues may influence the nuclear translocation of a clock protein complex containing mPer1.

Recently it has been revealed that a positive-negative transcriptional feedback mechanism may be responsible for the generation of the circadian clock signal in various species (1Danlap J.C.

Miyazaki J. Takahashi J.S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Google Scholar).In this context, it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of clock-related proteins such as Per1 has an important role in regulating the circadian clock. The Drosophila Period protein (dPer) and mammalian Per proteins (Per1–3) have been reported to undergo temporal shifts in electrophoretic mobility due to phosphorylation (9Edery I. Zwiebel L.J. Dembinska M.E. Rosbash M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2260-2264Google Scholar, 10Lee C. Etchegaray J.P. Cagampang F.R.A. Loudon A.S.I. Reppert S.M. Cell. 2001; 107: 855-867Google Scholar). Drosophila Double-time (Dbt) protein, a homologue of mammalian CK1ϵ, was suggested to be a putative kinase for the dPer protein (11Kloss B. Price J.L. Saez L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Wesley C.S. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 97-107Google Scholar). Mutant alleles of dbt that confer shortened or lengthened circadian behavioral rhythms, or that abolish circadian rhythms altogether, have been identified (12Price J.L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Abodeely M. Kloss B. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 83-95Google Scholar). These alterations are correlated with changes in the phosphorylation and stability of dPer, indicating that Dbt is a necessary component of the circadian clock mechanism (12Price J.L. Blau J. Rothenfluh A. Abodeely M. Kloss B. Young M.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 83-95Google Scholar). Similar roles for mammalian Dbt have also been suggested by recent findings. The Syrian hamster Tau mutation confers free running periods of 22 h for heterozygotes and 20 h for homozygotes. The tau locus was cloned and found to encode the hamster homologue of CK1ϵ. The Tau mutation is a single nucleotide change that causes an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at amino acid (aa) residue 178, which is highly conserved in other members of the CK1 family. The mutant protein can still associate with mPer proteins, but its kinase activity is much lower than that of wild-type CK1ϵ (13Lowrey P.L. Shimomura K. Antoch M.P. Yamazaki S. Zemenides P.D. Ralph M.R. Menaker M. Takahashi J.S. Science. 2000; 288: 483-492Google Scholar). Furthermore, hPer2 was shown to be implicated in a human disorder, familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome (FASPS), an autosomal dominant circadian rhythm disorder characterized by a 4-h phase advance in the daily sleep-wake cycle (14Toh K.L. Jones C.R. He Y. Eide E.J. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. Ptacek L.J. Fu Y.H. Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Google Scholar). FASPS is caused by a serine-to-glycine substitution affecting aa 662 of hPer2, which is located within a domain thought to be bound and phosphorylated by CK1ϵ. The hPer2 mutant was shown to be less phosphorylated by CK1ϵ than the wild type hPer2 in vitro. In addition, CK1ϵ-1 phosphorylates not only Per proteins but also Cry1 and BMAL1 (15Eide E.J. Vielhaber E.L. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17248-17254Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that CK1ϵ is a component of the mechanism that regulates circadian rhythms.In experiments with COS-7 cells, we previously found evidence that CK1ϵ interacts with the mouse Per proteins mPer1, mPer2, and mPer3 and that it causes mPer1 and mPer3, but not mPer2, to enter the nucleus in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar). In contrast, it was reported that coexpression of mPer1 and CK1ϵ in HEK293 cells causes mPer1 to be transferred to the cytoplasm from the nucleus, which was explained as being due to the masking of the mPer1 nuclear localization signal (NLS) by phosphorylation of the protein (17Vielhaber E.

Although these data suggested that CK1ϵ is important in generating circadian rhythms in mammals, the precise molecular effect of CK1ϵ on mPer proteins remained unclear.In this work, we identify putative CK1ϵ-dependent phosphorylation sites in mPer1 that are responsible for its entry into the nucleus. Our results suggest that one of three clusters of these sites is involved in controlling the subcellular localization of mPer1 and thus is implicated in the circadian clock mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIn Vitro Kinase Assay—Recombinant rat CK1ϵ (rCK1ϵ) was used for in vitro kinase assays. cDNA encoding the full-length protein or the catalytic domain (aa 1–297) of rCK1ϵ was subcloned into the vectors pTrcHisb (Invitrogen) or pGEX4T-3 (Qiagen) to produce hexahistidine-tagged rCK1ϵ (His-rCK1ϵ) or GST-fused rCK1ϵ (GST-rCK1ϵ), respectively. These expression vectors were transformed into the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli expression system (Stratagene). His-rCK1ϵ was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) and GST-rCK1ϵ with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturers' protocol. Prior to use in kinase assays, recombinant His-rCK1ϵ was subjected to limited digestion with trypsin (15 min at 30 °C) to eliminate the COOH terminus and to reduce autophosphorylation, which hampers its activity toward exogenous substrate. Fragments of mPer1 fused to GST (GST-mPer) and a hemagglutinin-tagged full-length mPer1 (HA-mPer1) protein were used as substrates for the kinase assay. The GST-mPer fragment was produced in a manner similar to that described for GST-rCK1ϵ. The mPer1 fragment was mutated as described below. Overexpressed HA-mPer1 was purified by immunoprecipitation using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) from COS-7 cell lysates. Kinase reactions (Fig. 1) were performed for 10 min at 37 °C in a buffer containing 45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 9 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 40 μm ATP, and 92.5 Bq/pmol [γ-32P]ATP. For quantitative analysis (Fig. 5), recombinant GST-rCK1ϵ (8–10 pmol) was incubated with GST-mPer1 or mutant derivatives (3–5 pmol) in 20 μl of kinase buffer at 30 °C in the presence of 500 μm ATP and 7.4 Bq/pmol [γ-32P]ATP according to the method of Sanada K. et al. (18Sanada K. Okano T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 267-271Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed in 10 or 6% polyacrylamide gels. The incorporation of radioactive phosphate into mPer1 fragments was detected with a BAS 3000 image analyzer (Fujifilm). These samples were also subjected to immunoblot analysis using the anti-HA antibody or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to confirm the molecular size of the substrates.Fig. 5Effects of the nuclear export inhibitor Leptomycin B on the subcellular localizations of mPer1 and mutant derivatives in COS-7 cells.A, representative examples of the subcellular distribution patterns of HA-tagged wild type mPer1 (panels a and b), S[661,663]A (panels c and d), wild type mPer1 coexpressed with rCK1ϵ (panels e and f), and S[661,663]A coexpressed with rCK1ϵ (panels g and h) in COS-7 cells.

Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar). Briefly, site-directed mutagenesis was performed in a single step by PCR to change specific mPer1 serine and threonine residues to alanine or glycine. Mutated DNA was identified by DpnI selection for hemimethylated DNA, and the sequences were verified by the dideoxynucleotide chain reaction method using the BigDye sequencing kit and an ABI Prism model 310 genetic analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences-Applied Biosystems). For expression in mammalian cells, cDNA encoding rCk1ϵ or a kinase-inactive mutant (rCk1ϵK38R) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). cDNAs encoding wild type and mutant versions of mPer1 were subcloned into the HA tag vector pHM6 (Invitrogen). In cotransfection experiments with three proteins (Fig. 7), mCry1 cDNA was subcloned into the vector pHM6 and mPer1 cDNA was subcloned into the vector pcDNA3. For identification of rCK1ϵ by CFP-specific fluorescence, rCk1ϵ cDNA was subcloned into the vector pCFP (kindly provided by Dr. A. Miyawaki, Brain Research Institute, RIKEN (The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research)). COS-7 cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with expression vectors carrying mPer1, rCk1ϵ, and mCry1 sequences with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Fig. 7Subcellular localization of the clock-related protein complex depends on Ser-661 and Ser-663 of mPer1.A, representative examples of the subcellular distribution patterns of wild type mPer1 (panel b), S[661,663]A (panels e and h) in COS-7 cells coexpressed with CFP-rCK1ϵ (panels a, d, and g) and HA-mCry1 (panels c, f, and i).

For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with the anti-HA antibody or an anti-rCK1ϵ antibody (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The precipitates were then washed three times with TNE buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. After incubation with the anti-rCK1ϵ antibody (1: 5000) or anti-HA antibody (1:2000), the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) or mouse IgG (1:2000) antiserum (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as a secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection system (Western Lightning kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to x-ray films (Fujifilm).Antibody Production—A rabbit polyclonal anti-mPer1 antibody was raised against the peptide Cys-(ALPAEENSTS) corresponding to aa 1282–1291 of mPer1 (kindly synthesized by K. Kawakami and Dr. S. Aimoto, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University) and purified by affinity chromatography using the antigen peptide coupled with SulfoLink (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cell Staining—For expression studies, the TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were fixed and performed staining as described previously (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar).Leptomycin B Treatment—Twenty-four hours after transfection, COS-7 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml Leptomycin B (LMB) (Sigma) for 2 h. In all experiments, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was added 6 h before LMB treatment to block de novo protein synthesis.RESULTSIdentification of CK1ϵ-dependent Phosphorylation Sites in mPer1—Previous reports by others and from our laboratory indicated that CK1ϵ phosphorylates mPer proteins and affects their subcellular localization and turnover (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar, 17Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Google Scholar, 19Vielhaber E. Duricka D. Ullman K.S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45921-45927Google Scholar, 20Akashi M. Tsuchiya Y. Yoshino T. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1693-1703Google Scholar). To clarify the function of CK1ϵ in the circadian clock mechanism, we identified mPer sites phosphorylated by CK1ϵ by performing in vitro kinase assays using a series of GST-mPer1 fragments as substrates for rCK1ϵ (Fig. 1A). We first found that rCK1ϵ phosphorylated a GST-mPer1 fragment containing aa 547–799 (Fig. 1A, lane 6). To further define the phosphorylated region of mPer1, four smaller GST-tagged fragments covering aa 549–799 were constructed (Fig. 1A, lanes 8–11). Three of these fragments (aa 627–667, aa 667–742, and aa 742–799) were phosphorylated by rCK1ϵ (Fig. 1A, lanes 9–11), but the fourth (aa 547–628) was not (Fig. 1A, lane 8). This result suggests that mPer1 contains at least three CK1ϵ phosphorylation sites, within the region from aa 628–799.The sites of CK1ϵ-mediated phosphorylation in mPer2 and mPer3 were also examined. rCK1ϵ was found to phosphorylate only a GST-tagged mPer2 fragment containing aa 486–793 and a GST-tagged mPer3 fragment containing aa 367–880 (data not shown).Next, we searched for the CK1ϵ-phosphorylation consensus motif (Ser/Thr-X-X-Ser/Thr or Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-X-X-Ser/Thr) (21Flotow H. Graves P.R. Wang A.Q. Fiol C.J. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14264-14269Google Scholar) within the CK1ϵ-targeted regions of the mPer proteins. For mPer1, two consensus motif clusters were found, from aa 653 to 663 (ST653–663) and aa 714 to 726 (S714–726), as well as an isolated single motif from aa 784 to 787 (ST784–787) (Fig. 1B). The S714–726 region, which is conserved among all mPer proteins, has been suggested to be relevant for their ubiquitination (20Akashi M. Tsuchiya Y. Yoshino T. Nishida E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1693-1703Google Scholar). Moreover, a mutation in the corresponding region of hPer2 was reported to cause familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome (FASPS) (14Toh K.L. Jones C.R. He Y. Eide E.J. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. Ptacek L.J. Fu Y.H. Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Google Scholar). ST784–787 is conserved in mPer3 but not mPer2, and ST653–663 is not found in mPer2 or mPer3. To clarify whether these putative motifs are indeed phosphorylated and, if so, whether they are responsible for the phosphorylation-dependent nuclear entry of mPer proteins, we constructed several HA-mPer1 mutants. In three of these, the serine and threonine residues in a single consensus motif cluster were replaced by alanine (S/T[653–663]A, S[714–726]A, and S[784]A). In a fourth derivative all three consensus motif clusters were mutated (S/T[653–784]A). Another replacement mutant with alterations of the motif cluster from aa 902 to 916 (ST902–916), which has been reported to be a region phosphorylated by CK1ϵ (17Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Google Scholar), was also constructed (S/T[902–916]A) (Fig. 1B).Identification of Phosphorylation Sites Necessary for the Nuclear Entry of mPer1—To determine how many CK1ϵ-dependent phosphorylation sites are present in mPer1, the phosphorylation status of each mPer1 mutant in the presence of rCK1ϵ was examined. COS-7 cells were transfected with vectors expressing HA-tagged full-length or mutant mPer1 derivatives, along with wild type rCK1ϵ, a kinase-inactive rCK1ϵ mutant (rCK1ϵ-KN) in which the lysine residue at aa 38 was replaced by arginine or an empty control vector. The levels of phosphorylation of the mPer1 proteins were initially assessed by a shift in electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE gels, as detected by immunoblot analysis. Wild type mPer1 and the mPer1 mutant S[784]A underwent an obvious shift in mobility in the presence of intact rCK1ϵ (Fig. 2A, lanes 1–3 and 10–12). However, the S/T[653–663]A mutant showed a lower mobility shift than did the wild type protein (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–6), and the S[714–726]A mutant exhibited a striking electrophoretic mobility even in the absence of rCK1ϵ protein (Fig. 2A, lane 7–9). The S/T[653–784]S mutant, in which all serine and threonine residues of the three consensus motif clusters were replaced, was still phosphorylated (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–15). Each mPer1 mutant could be coimmunoprecipitated with rCK1ϵ. These results suggest that there are multiple CK1ϵ-dependent phosphorylation sites in mPer1 and that each phosphorylation site differentially influences the phosphorylation status of mPer1.Fig. 2Effects of mutation of putative rCK1ϵ phosphorylation motif clusters in mPer1 on its subcellular localization in COS-7 cells coexpressing rCK1ϵ.A, immunoblot analyses of the interaction and phosphorylation of mPer1 and mutant derivatives by rCK1ϵ. HA-tagged mPer1 and mutant derivatives were coexpressed with the empty vector pcDNA3, rCK1ϵ, or rCK1ϵ-KN (K38R) in COS-7 cells, and the phosphorylation status of HA-mPer1 proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE as a shift in electrophoretic mobility. All mPer1 mutants were coimmunoprecipitated with rCK1ϵ and exhibited mobility shifts.

C, quantitative results of the subcellular localization of HA-mPer1 and mutant derivatives. At least three independent trials, in which 30–100 cells were counted, were performed for each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our previous study showed that the coexpression of rCK1ϵ causes mPer1 and mPer3, but not mPer2, to enter the nucleus in COS-7 cells (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar). To identify the Ser/Thr residues responsible for mediating the phosphorylation-dependent nuclear entry of mPer1, HA-tagged wild type or mutant mPer1 proteins were coexpressed with rCK1ϵ in COS-7 cells, and their subcellular localizations were determined by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 2, B and C). When HA-mPer1 or mutant proteins were overexpressed alone, they localized mainly in the cytoplasm and were observed in the nucleus in less than one-third of the cells (Fig. 2B, panels a, c, e, g, and i). When wild type HA-mPer1 was coexpressed with rCK1ϵ, most of the protein was found in the nucleus (Fig. 2B, panel b). This difference in the subcellular localization of HA-mPer1 is likely due to its phosphorylation by rCK1ϵ, as indicated by its cytoplasmic localization when it was coexpressed with the kinase-inactive version of rCK1ϵ (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, coexpression of HA-mPer1 S/T[653–663]A or S[714–726]A with rCK1ϵ did not result in the nuclear localization of these proteins (Fig. 2B, panels d and f). HA-mPer1 S/T[653–663]A coexpressed with the empty vector or with kinase-inactive rCK1ϵ-KN did not appear in the nucleus, but approximately one-third of the HA-mPer1 S[714–726]A protein was observed in the nucleus when it was coexpressed with the vector or rCK1ϵ-KN. These data indicate that the rCK1ϵ-dependent phosphorylation motif clusters ST653–663 and S714–726 of mPer1 are important for its nuclear entry and that the ST653–663 region is of special importance, because the HA-mPer1 S/T[653–663]A mutant did not localize to the nucleus even when it was coexpressed with empty vector or the kinase-inactive rCK1ϵ-KN. In contrast, HA-mPer1 S[784]A and S/T[902–916]A entered the nucleus in a manner dependent on phosphorylation by rCK1ϵ, but the proportion of these mutant proteins in the nucleus was significantly lower compared with wild type mPer1 (Fig. 2B). For HEK 293 cells, which express considerable amounts of endogenous CK1ϵ, it was previously reported that overexpressed mPer1 was found in the nucleus but that in the presence of exogenous CK1ϵ it was exported to the cytoplasm (17Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4888-4899Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the subcellular localization of mPer1 and mutant derivatives in HEK 293 cells by methods similar to those used for COS-7 cells. Surprisingly, the HA-mPer1 S/T[653–663]A protein was observed only in the cytoplasm irrespective of the presence of rCK1ϵ (data not shown). Another mutant, HA-mPer1 S[714–726]A, was distributed in a pattern similar to that of wild type mPer1. These observations strongly suggest that the mPer1 ST653–663 motif cluster is essential for the nuclear entry of mPer1 mediated by CK1ϵ-dependent phosphorylation, because the mPer1 S/T[653–663]A protein is found only in the cytoplasm, irrespective of host cell type or the presence of rCK1ϵ.A Chimeric mPer2 Protein Is Transferred into the Nucleus by CK1ϵ—In our previous study (16Takano A. Shimizu K. Kani S Buijs R.M. Okada M. Nagai K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 477: 106-112Google Scholar), we showed that coexpression with CK1ϵ caused mPer1 and mPer3, but not mPer2, to enter the nucleus in COS-7 cells. Moreover, the mPer1 ST653–663 cluster motif is not conserved in mPer2 (Fig. 1C), and the absence of this region may therefore explain this difference. Thus, to confirm the nuclear import function of the ST653–663 motif cluster, we constructed a chimeric mPer2 mutant in which aa 611–620 were replaced by aa 652–667 of mPer1 (mPer2 [mPer1 652–667]). Furthermore, we constructed another HA-mPer2 mutant by replacing the alanine residue at position 723 with serine (mPer2 A[723]S), because this site corresponds to Ser-784 of mPer1, which is conserved in mPer3 but not in mPer2 (Fig. 1C). As expected, the HA-mPer2 [mPer1 652–667] protein entered the nucleus when coexpressed with rCK1ϵ in COS-7 cells, but the HA-mPer2 A[723]S protein did not (Fig. 3A, panels c–f). These data indicate that the ST653–663 motif cluster of mPer1 is essential for its phosphorylation-dependent entry into the nucleus. Both of these mPer2 mutants exhibited a shift in electrophoretic mobility similar to that of wild type mPer2 when coexpressed with rCK1ϵ (data not shown). Either the potential change in phosphorylation was beyond the sensitivity of the assay, or residues 653–663 may have an NLS function. These two possibilities should be addressed.Fig. 3The chimeric mPer2 protein with the S/T (653–663) region of mPer1 is transferred into the nucleus by CK1ϵ in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.A, representative examples of the subcellular distribution patterns of HA-tagged wild type mPer2 (panels a and b), mPer2[mPer1 652–667] (panels c and d), and mPer2 A[723]S (panels e and f) in COS-7 cells transfected with the empty vector (upper panels) or rCK1ϵ (lower panels).

Only two mPer1 mutants, S[661]A and S[663]A, showed marked and significant decreases in the frequency of nuclear localization when coexpressed with rCK1ϵ (37.8% for S[661]A and 14.0% for S[663]A (Fig. 4A, panels i and j)), and the other mPer1 mutants were observed mainly in the nucleus. A mPer1 mutant in which both Ser-661 and Ser-663 were replaced by alanine (S[661,663]A) localized only in the cytoplasm, like mPer1 S/T[653–663]A (Fig. 4A, panels b and k).Fig. 4The mPer1 serine 661 and 663 residues are responsible for CK1ϵ-dependant nuclear translocation in COS-7 cells.A, representative examples of the subcellular distribution patterns of HA-tagged wild type mPer1 (a), S/T[653–663]A (b), S[653]A (c), S[655]A (d), S[656]A (e), T[658]A (f), S[660]A (g), S[661]A (h), S[663]A (i), and S[661,663]A (j) in COS-7 cells transfected with rCK1ϵ.

Rare and low levels of tissue expression together with the lack of AIRE-expressing cell lines have hampered a detailed analysis of the molecular dynamics of AIRE. Here we have established cell lines stably transfected with AIRE and studied the regulatory mechanisms for its subcellular expression. We found that nuclear body (NB) formation by AIRE was dependent on the cell cycle. Biochemical fractionation revealed that a significant proportion of AIRE is associated with the nuclear matrix, which directs the functional domains of chromatin to provide sites for gene regulation. Upon proteasome inhibition, AIRE NBs were increased with concomitant reduced expression in the cytoplasm, suggesting that subcellular targeting of AIRE is regulated by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We also found that AIRE NBs compete for cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300, a common coactivator of transcription, with the promyelocytic leukemia gene product. These results suggest that the transcriptional regulating activities of AIRE within a cell are controlled and organized in a spatiotemporal manner.

The AIRE gene encodes a predicted 58-kDa protein carrying a conserved nuclear localization signal, two plant homeodomain (PHD)-type zinc fingers, four LXXLL motifs or nuclear receptor interaction domains, and the recently described homogenously staining region and SAND domains (3Nagamine K.

Based on the fact that PHD resembles the RING finger, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase (7Joazeiro C.A. Hunter T. Science. 2000; 289: 2061-2062Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), in both sequence and structure (8Pascual J. Martinez-Yamout M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Capili A.D. Schultz D.C. Rauscher I.F. Borden K.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 165-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we have recently found that AIRE acts as an E3 Ub ligase through the N-terminal PHD domain (PHD1) (10Uchida D. Hatakeyama S. Matsushima A. Han H. Ishido S. Hotta H. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Doucas V. Nakayama K.I. Kuroda N. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The significance of this finding was underscored by the fact that disease-causing missense mutations in the PHD1 (i.e. C311Y and P326Q) abolished its E3 ligase activity. We speculate that AIRE might exert its function by facilitating polyubiquitination of substrate(s) in yet undetermined processes. One of the key features of AIRE in the context of autoimmunity is its limited tissue expression in medullary epithelial cells and cells of the monocyte-dendritic cell lineage of the thymus (11Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A. Rantala I. Nieminen M. Tuukkanen J. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mitchison N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Another characteristic feature of AIRE is its subcellular localization. Immunocytochemical staining has revealed its presence in the nucleus, appearing as a speckled pattern known as a nuclear body (NB) (11Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A. Rantala I. Nieminen M. Tuukkanen J. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19597-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Despite intense efforts, a coherent explanation of NB function has yet to emerge. Although understanding the relationship between AIRE gene malfunction and the breakdown of self-tolerance promises to help unravel the pathogenesis of not only APECED but also other types of autoimmune disease, rare and low levels of tissue expression have hampered a detailed analysis of the molecular dynamics of AIRE. This situation is compounded by the lack of availability of established cell lines constitutively expressing AIRE. To overcome these difficulties, we have established cell lines stably transfected with AIRE and studied the molecular dynamics of AIRE in detail, especially focusing on the factors that influence its subcellular expression. The establishment of stably transfected cell lines with AIRE has enabled us to investigate many aspects of AIRE that could not be easily addressed by the transient expression systems. Our results suggest the existence of a group of mechanisms that together control AIRE expression within a cell in a spatiotemporal manner. Construction of the Fusion Gene for AIRE cDNA with Marker Genes—Human AIRE cDNA was amplified by PCR from Marathon-Ready human thymus cDNA (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Briefly, AIRE cDNA was first amplified with adaptor primers according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then nested PCR was performed with AIRE-specific primers in which EcoRI and SalI restriction sites were added at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The following primers were used: AIRE-U1, CGGAATTCATGGCGACGGACGCGGCGCTAC; AIRE-D1, ACGCGTCGACTCAGGAGGGGAAGGGGGCCG. The resulting fragment containing the human AIRE open reading frame was ligated into the cloning site downstream of the enhanced fluorescent gene in pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences), FLAG-tag in pCR3 vector (Invitrogen), or 6Myc-tag in pCR3 vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using human AIRE cDNA cloned into pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) as a template. pFLAG-AIRE C299A and C434A were generated with QuikChange (Stratagene) (10Uchida D. Hatakeyama S. Matsushima A. Han H. Ishido S. Hotta H. Kudoh J. Shimizu N. Doucas V. Nakayama K.I. Kuroda N. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The sequence of each constructed vector was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method with automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Establishment of Stable Transfectants Expressing the AIRE Fusion Genes and Transient Gene Expression Studies—HeLa cells were transfected with pEGFP-AIRE plasmid by use of the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight hours later, culturing of the cells in selection media containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was started. After 14 days of culture in selection media, G418-resistant clones were isolated. The fluorescence signals from the cells were determined with the aid of fluorescence microscopy, and the representative fluorescent clones were further expanded. For the construction of retrovirus vector, human AIRE cDNAs were subcloned into pMX-puro-FLAG vector (kindly provided by Dr. T. Kitamura). Medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) line 1C6 (kindly provided by Dr. M. Kasai) (14Kasai M. Hirokawa K. Kajino K. Ogasawara K. Tatsumi M. Hermel E. Monaco J.J. Mizuochi T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2101-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or NIH3T3 cells were infected with the pMX-puro-FLAG-AIRE vectors and cultured for 14 days in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin (BD Biosciences). For blockade of proteasome activity, cells were treated with 100 μmN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) or with 5 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (MG132; Calbiochem) for 16 h. Transient gene expression studies were performed using the LipofectAMINE transfection reagent (Invitrogen) for COS-1 and RD cells and electroporation for NB4 cells. The pSI-AIRE and CMX-PML expression plasmids and anti-AIRE Abs have been described previously (11Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A. Rantala I. Nieminen M.

Isolation of Cellular Proteins and Western Blot Analysis—Sequential isolation of subcellular components was performed as described previously (15He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. Briefly, wild-type HeLa cells and pEGFP-AIRE-transfected HeLa cells were washed once with PBS and resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The cells were vortex-mixed vigorously and kept on ice for 10 min. The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 min at 5,000 × g, and the supernatant was harvested for the cytoplasmic protein. After isolation of the cytoplasmic protein, nuclear pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of cytoskeletal (CSK) buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors) containing 100 units of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) and incubated for 50 min at 30 °C. Ammonium sulfate was then added to a final concentration of 0.25 m, and the samples were kept on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was harvested (chromatin fraction), and the pellets were then extracted with 2 m NaCl in CSK buffer. After further centrifugation, the supernatant was harvested (2 m NaCl wash), and the pellets were lysed with 8 m urea to provide the nuclear matrix fraction. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) with anti-GFP polyclonal Ab (Invitrogen), anti-IκBα polyclonal Ab, and anti-lamin A/C mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). An anti-AIRE polyclonal Ab was raised by immunizing rabbits with peptides corresponding to the C terminus of human AIRE. In situ extraction of the subcellular components from stable transfectants grown on coverslips was performed with the same method as described above. Immunocytochemical Staining—pEGFP-AIRE-transfected HeLa cells seeded on coverslips were subjected to immunocytochemistry. Briefly, cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing the cells with PBS, nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with appropriate Abs (anti-PML and anti-CBP/p300 polyclonal Abs were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Abs (Invitrogen) were used for detection of the primary Ab. After staining with 2 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Roche Applied Science) in PBS, coverslips were mounted with ProLong Antifade (Invitrogen), and fluorescence signals were observed with the aid of a fluorescence microscope or confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser. Assessment of Ubiquitination of AIRE—Proteins were expressed by transfecting expression constructs with the Myc-tagged human AIRE cDNA and HA-tagged ubiquitin cDNA into COS-7 cells (17Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10) and Western blot analysis with anti-HA polyclonal Ab, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, were performed as described previously (16Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Hatakeyama S. Yada M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For proteomics analysis, human AIRE was expressed in 293T cells with a modified tandem affinity purification system (18Oshikawa K. Matsumoto M. Yada M. Kamura T. Hatakeyama S. Nakayama K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The bands were excised from the gel and then in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI). The molecular masses of the tryptic peptides were determined using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), and protein identification was performed with the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—The production of full-sized recombinant AIRE and the in vitro ubiquitination assay were performed as described (10Uchida D. Hatakeyama S. Matsushima A. Han H. Ishido S.

Nakayama K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33111-33120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In brief, reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 1 μg of recombinant AIRE, 0.1 μg of recombinant rabbit E1 (Boston Biomedica, Cambridge, MA), 1 μl of crude Escherichia coli lysate containing human Ubc4, 0.5 units of phosphocreatine kinase, 1 μg of Ub (Sigma), 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm creatine phosphate were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer containing 4% 2-mercaptoethanol and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 6% gel and then subjected to Western blot analysis with a mouse mAb to Ub (clone 1B3; MBL, Nagoya, Japan) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal Ab to mouse immunoglobulin (Promega). Signals were detected with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Establishment of Stable Transfectants Expressing AIRE—It has been demonstrated that AIRE is predominantly expressed in the mTEC with the characteristic morphology of NB (11Heino M. Peterson P. Kudoh J. Nagamine K. Lagerstedt A. Ovod V. Ranki A. Rantala I. Nieminen M. Tuukkanen J. Scott H.S. Antonarakis S.E. Shimizu N. Krohn K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19597-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the low levels of expression together with the lack of established cell lines constitutively expressing AIRE have hampered a detailed analysis of the molecular dynamics of AIRE. To approach this issue, we constructed a fusion gene in which the AIRE gene was fused with a green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker, and we obtained a stable transfectant of this fusion gene in HeLa cells of epithelial cell lineage (GFP-AIRE/HeLa). We first examined the expression of GFP-AIRE in HeLa cells with the aid of a fluorescence microscope. As reported for endogenous AIRE as well as for transiently expressed AIRE gene in cultured cells, GFP-AIRE was expressed primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1A, left). In addition to the moderate nucleoplasmic expression, GFP-AIRE was found concentrated in discrete nuclear speckles of NBs. Unexpectedly, not all of the cells showed typical NB morphology, and approximately two-thirds of the cells displayed faint and homogeneous nuclear fluorescence without apparent NBs. The low frequency of occurrence of cells with typical NBs was not due to the mixture of GFP-AIRE-expressing cells with untransfected cells, because limiting dilution culture twice did not significantly change the population of cells with NBs (data not shown and see below). Most of the GFP-AIRE NBs, when observed, were not colocalized with endogenous PML bodies, as revealed by double immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1B). It has been demonstrated that NB formation by PML, a prototypic NB protein that is thought to play a role in the control of apoptosis (19Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Zhong S. Salomoni P. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), is cell-cycle related; PML formed NBs at a significantly higher level in the G1 phase (21Chang K.S. Fan Y.H. Andreeff M. Liu J. Mu Z.M. Blood. 1995; 85: 3646-3653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore suspected that the infrequent expression of NBs in the GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells might be due in part to a similar mechanism. With the use of time-lapse analysis, we have observed that NBs largely disappeared before mitosis but are quickly re-formed after cell division (supplemental Movie 1), clearly indicating that NB formation by AIRE is cell cycle-dependent. Association of AIRE with the Nuclear Matrix—Although the structural characteristics of AIRE protein suggest that it is a transcriptional regulating factor (13Pitkänen J. Vahamurto P. Krohn K.

J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41357-41364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), biochemical data supporting this idea are still limited. To obtain further insight into the function of AIRE, we investigated its subcellular localization. Nuclear matrix, the insoluble skeletal framework of the nucleus, is a dynamic structural subcomponent of the nucleus that directs functional domains of chromatin to provide sites for the specific control of nucleic acids (25Nickerson J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 463-474PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether AIRE might exert a transcriptional regulating function in the nuclear matrix fraction, GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells grown on coverslips were sequentially extracted in situ with a detergent (CSK buffer), DNase I, ammonium sulfate, and high salt, leaving behind the nuclear matrix. The efficiency of chromatin digestion and removal was assessed by the disappearance of DNA staining with DAPI, and the presence of nuclear matrix after this treatment was confirmed by staining with a mAb against lamin A/C, a core nuclear matrix-associated protein (26Wilson K.L. Zastrow M.S. Lee K.K. Cell. 2001; 104: 647-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The speckled pattern of GFP-AIRE NBs was still detectable after these extractions, suggesting that a significant proportion of AIRE protein was associated with the nuclear matrix. This finding was also supported by Western blot analysis, in which nuclear matrix protein was recovered with 8 m urea after high salt extraction and assayed for the presence of GFP-AIRE protein. We found significant amounts of GFP-AIRE protein in this fraction from GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells but not from wild-type HeLa cells (Fig. 2B). Successful fractionation of the cytoplasmic and nuclear matrix proteins was ascertained by Western blot analysis with Abs specific for IκBα and lamin A/C, respectively. Although we did not observe apparent fluorescence signals from the cytoplasm of GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells, the cytoplasmic fraction contained a certain amount of GFP-AIRE protein. This discrepancy could be due to differences in the sensitivities of the detection systems used. Association of AIRE protein with the nuclear matrix was also observed in other cell types stably transfected with AIRE (i.e. FLAG-AIRE/mTEC cells and Myc-AIRE/NIH3T3 cells; see below) (supplemental Fig. S1). Ubiquitin-dependent Subcellular Targeting of AIRE—It has been demonstrated that PML changes its subcellular localization in a proteasome-dependent manner; many PML NBs accumulated in nucleoli upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors such as MG132 (27Mattsson K. Pokrovskaja K. Kiss C. Klein G. Szekely L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We used GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells to examine whether the subcellular localization of AIRE is controlled by a similar proteasome-dependent mechanism. Upon proteasome inhibition with ALLN or MG132 (data not shown), we observed enhanced fluorescence signals from the cells (Fig. 1A, right); not only was there an increase in the percentage of cells exhibiting NBs but there was also an increase in the size of each dot (supplemental Movie 2). Of note, NBs accumulated in proximity to the nucleoli, where DAPI staining is faint with this treatment. In contrast to GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells, HeLa cells stably transfected with GFP alone (GFP/HeLa) showed homogenous fluorescence signals from both cytoplasm and nucleus (data not shown). Upon proteasome inhibition, the distribution pattern of GFP in GFP/HeLa cells remained unchanged, although the fluorescence signals were moderately enhanced. Because AIRE and PML protein are not colocalized in untreated GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells, as described above, but both change their localization within the nucleus upon inhibition of the proteasome pathway (Fig. 1A) (27Mattsson K. Pokrovskaja K. Kiss C. Klein G. Szekely L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1012-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we attempted to determine whether AIRE and PML were colocalized after proteasome inhibition. Most of the cells showed no colocalization of AIRE and PML after proteasome inhibition, as observed for untreated cells (data not shown). Thus, AIRE and PML do not largely share their metabolic pathways, although subcellular targeting of these NBs might be controlled by a similar proteasome-dependent mechanism. We have also investigated proteasome-dependent subcellular targeting of AIRE in the mouse mTEC line 1C6 (14Kasai M. Hirokawa K. Kajino K. Ogasawara K. Tatsumi M. Hermel E. Monaco J.J. Mizuochi T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2101-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) stably transfected with FLAG-tagged AIRE (FLAG-AIRE/mTEC). In contrast to GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells, FLAG-AIRE/mTEC cells displayed scattered fine dots of AIRE not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A, a–c). Upon proteasome inhibition, AIRE in the cytoplasm was decreased, and AIRE predominantly accumulated in the nucleus (compare Fig. 3, A, d–f, with A, a–c) (supplemental Fig. S2A). Enhancement of FLAG-AIRE expression after MG132 treatment, as assessed by Western blot analysis, was much weaker compared with that in GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells. 2H. Akiyoshi, S. Hatakeyama, K. I. Nakayama, and M. Matsumoto, unpublished observations. We also established NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with FLAG-tagged AIRE (FLAG-AIRE/NIH3T3: Fig. 3B) as well as with Myc-tagged AIRE (Myc-AIRE/NIH3T3: Fig. 3C). Upon treatment of FLAG-AIRE/NIH3T3 cells with MG132, AIRE in the cytoplasm was decreased and AIRE predominantly accumulated in the nucleus (compare Fig. 3, B, j–l with B, g–i) (supplemental Fig. S2B); both the size of dots within the nucleus and the numbers of NB were moderately increased. Although AIRE NBs were concentrated in some area within the nucleus upon proteasome inhibition, it was not in the nucleoli; AIRE and nucleolin were not colocalized in Myc-AIRE/NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3C, d). Thus, proteasome-dependent subcellular targeting of AIRE was not confined to some particular cell types and/or tags for detection (i.e. GFP, FLAG, and Myc). In contrast, the increased amount of AIRE protein after proteasome inhibition was somewhat dependent on cell type; GFP-AIRE/HeLa cells showed a more dramatic increase compared with FLAG-AIRE/mTEC cells or FLAG-AIRE/NIH3T3 cells. AIRE Is Subject to Modification with Ubiquitin—To confirm that AIRE is under proteasome-dependent regulation for its subcellular targeting, we have tested whether AIRE can be ubiquitinated in vivo. To investigate this, Myc-tagged AIRE and HA-tagged Ub were coexpressed in COS-7 cells (which do not express endogenous AIRE as assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR; data not shown), and the ubiquitination of AIRE was assessed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc mAb followed by detection with anti-HA Ab (Fig. 4A). Although plasmid expressing the Myc tag alone did not show any association with Ub"
https://openalex.org/W2088569576,"Signals by cytokines of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily are negatively regulated by inhibitory Smads (I-Smads). Smad7 inhibits signaling by both TGF-β and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), whereas Smad6 inhibits TGF-β signals less effectively. I-Smads have amino-terminal N domains and carboxyl-terminal Mad homology 2 (MH2) domains. The N domains are essential for specific inhibition of TGF-β signaling by Smad7, whereas the MH2 domains of I-Smads are involved in the inhibition of TGF-β superfamily signals through interaction with type I receptors. Here, we have identified four basic amino acid residues (Lys-312, Lys-316, Lys-401, and Arg-409) in the basic surface of the Smad7 MH2 domain that play important roles in interaction with type I receptors. Mutations of the four basic amino acid residues to acidic residues (K312E, K316E, K401E, and R409E) abolished the interaction of Smad7 with TGF-β type I receptors, inhibition of Smad2 phosphorylation and transcriptional responses induced by TGF-β, and induction of target genes of endogenous activin/Nodal signals in Xenopus early embryos. The K401E and R409E mutants of Smad7 were also unable to interact with BMP type I receptors (BMPR-I), repress the Smad5 phosphorylation and transcription induced by BMP, and effectively inhibit endogenous BMP signals in Xenopus early embryos. However, the K312E and K316E mutants were able to interact with BMPR-I and retained the ability to inhibit BMP signaling. Thus, the MH2 domain of Smad7 plays important roles in specific inhibition of TGF-β superfamily signals through differential interaction with type I receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2089228253,"Prefoldin is a jellyfish-shaped hexameric co-chaperone of the group II chaperonins. It captures a protein folding intermediate and transfers it to a group II chaperonin for completion of folding. The manner in which prefoldin interacts with its substrates and cooperates with the chaperonin is poorly understood. In this study, we have examined the interaction between a prefoldin and a chaperonin from hyperthermophilic archaea by immunoprecipitation, single molecule observation, and surface plasmon resonance. We demonstrate that Pyrococcus prefoldin interacts most tightly with its cognate chaperonin, and vice versa, suggesting species specificity in the interaction. Using truncation mutants, we uncovered by kinetic analyses that this interaction is multivalent in nature, consistent with multiple binding sites between the two chaperones. We present evidence that both N- and C-terminal regions of the prefoldin β sub-unit are important for molecular chaperone activity and for the interaction with a chaperonin. Our data are consistent with substrate and chaperonin binding sites on prefoldin that are different but in close proximity, which suggests a possible handover mechanism of prefoldin substrates to the chaperonin. Prefoldin is a jellyfish-shaped hexameric co-chaperone of the group II chaperonins. It captures a protein folding intermediate and transfers it to a group II chaperonin for completion of folding. The manner in which prefoldin interacts with its substrates and cooperates with the chaperonin is poorly understood. In this study, we have examined the interaction between a prefoldin and a chaperonin from hyperthermophilic archaea by immunoprecipitation, single molecule observation, and surface plasmon resonance. We demonstrate that Pyrococcus prefoldin interacts most tightly with its cognate chaperonin, and vice versa, suggesting species specificity in the interaction. Using truncation mutants, we uncovered by kinetic analyses that this interaction is multivalent in nature, consistent with multiple binding sites between the two chaperones. We present evidence that both N- and C-terminal regions of the prefoldin β sub-unit are important for molecular chaperone activity and for the interaction with a chaperonin. Our data are consistent with substrate and chaperonin binding sites on prefoldin that are different but in close proximity, which suggests a possible handover mechanism of prefoldin substrates to the chaperonin. Molecular chaperones are ubiquitous proteins that are required for the correct folding, assembly, transport, and degradation of proteins within the cell (1Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar). One class of chaperones, termed chaperonins, are seven- to nine-membered double ring complexes of 800–1000 kDa that capture non-native proteins in their central cavity to promote correct folding in an ATP-dependent manner (2Ellis R.J. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 20-26Google Scholar, 3Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Google Scholar, 4Ranson N.A. White H.E. Saibil H.R. Biochem.

They are classified into two groups, group I found in bacteria and organelles of eukaryotes, and group II in archaea and in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes (6Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Google Scholar, 7Kubota H. Hynes G. Willison K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 3-16Google Scholar). The bacterial group I chaperonin, GroEL, is a cylinder-shaped tetradecamer that is capped by the heptameric co-chaperone, GroES (8Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Google Scholar, 9Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 743-760Google Scholar, 10Sigler P.B. Xu Z. Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 581-608Google Scholar). In contrast, the group II chaperonin exists as an eight- or nine-rotationally symmetric double ring in a toroidal structure composed of homologous subunits of about 60 kDa and functions independently of a co-chaperone corresponding to GroES (11Archibald J.M. Logsdon J.M. Doolittle W.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1053-1056Google Scholar, 12Gutsche I. Essen L.O. Baumeister W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 295-312Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the group II chaperonins from the acidothermophilic archaeum Thermoplasma acidophilum and the hyperthermophilic archaeum Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 suggest that the long helical protrusions located at the opening of their cavities, in their apical domains, play the equivalent role of GroES as a built-in lid of the cavity (13Klumpp M. Baumeister W. Essen L.O. Cell. 1997; 91: 263-270Google Scholar, 14Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Stetter K.O. Huber H. Huber R. Steinbacher S. Cell. 1998; 93: 125-138Google Scholar, 15Shomura Y. Yoshida T. Iizuka R. Maruyama T. Yohda M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1265-1278Google Scholar). The archaeal chaperonin takes an open conformation in the nucleotide-free or ADP-bound states and changes to a closed conformation upon binding ATP (16Gutsche I. Holzinger J. Rauh N. Baumeister W. May R.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 139-146Google Scholar, 17Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar). Interestingly, closure of the built-in lid of CCT, 1The abbreviations used are: CCT, cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1; PFD, prefoldin; PhCPN, chaperonin from P. horikoshii OT3; PhPFD, prefoldin from P. horikoshii OT3; MtPFD, prefoldin from M. thermoautotrophicum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CS, citrate synthase from porcine heart; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TkCPN, α chaperonin from Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1; TthCPN, chaperonin from T. thermophilus HB8; wtα, wild-type PhPFD α subunit; wtβ, wild-type PhPFD β subunit; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; RU, resonance unit(s). 1The abbreviations used are: CCT, cytosolic chaperonin containing TCP-1; PFD, prefoldin; PhCPN, chaperonin from P. horikoshii OT3; PhPFD, prefoldin from P. horikoshii OT3; MtPFD, prefoldin from M. thermoautotrophicum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CS, citrate synthase from porcine heart; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; TkCPN, α chaperonin from Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1; TthCPN, chaperonin from T. thermophilus HB8; wtα, wild-type PhPFD α subunit; wtβ, wild-type PhPFD β subunit; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; RU, resonance unit(s). the eukaryotic cytosol group II chaperonin, is induced not by the binding but by the hydrolysis of ATP (18Meyer A.S. Gillespie J.R. Walther D. Millet I.S. Doniach S. Frydman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 369-381Google Scholar).The group II chaperonins cooperate with a co-chaperone, prefoldin/GimC (19Geissler S. Siegers K. Schiebel E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 952-966Google Scholar, 20Hansen W.J. Cowan N.J. Welch W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 265-277Google Scholar, 21Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Google Scholar). Prefoldin (PFD) has been shown to participate in the maturation of actin and members of the tubulin family by transferring them in the incompletely folded states to CCT. Although there is neither actin nor tubulin in archaea, both prefoldin homologues and group II chaperonins have invariably been identified in all archaeal species (21Vainberg I.E. Lewis S.A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Vandekerckhove J. Klein H.L. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 863-873Google Scholar, 22Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6730-6743Google Scholar). Archaeal prefoldin consists of only two species of subunits, namely α and β, whereas eukaryotic prefoldins are composed of two different but related α class subunits and four related β class subunits. The crystal structure of the archaeal prefoldin from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (MtPFD) has been determined at a resolution of 2.3 Å (23Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Google Scholar). It resembles a jellyfish in that its body consists of a double β-barrel assembly with six long tentacle-like coiled-coils protruding from it. The distal regions of the coiled-coils partially expose hydrophobic patches, and there is evidence that coiled-coils are required for the multivalent binding of non-native proteins (23Siegert R. Leroux M.R. Scheufler C. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Cell. 2000; 103: 621-632Google Scholar). Eukaryotic prefoldin possesses a structure similar to that of archaeal prefoldin and has been observed to capture a substrate protein (actin) in the cavity formed by its six “tentacles” (24Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional reconstitution of the prefoldin·actin complex, actin appears to interact with prefoldin in a region that is not well defined but is also consistent with the distal regions of the coiled-coils (24Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Google Scholar). Additional evidence for actin and tubulin substrate interaction with the distal ends of different but overlapping sets of eukaryotic prefoldin subunits has been obtained recently (25Simons C.T. Staes A. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4196-4203Google Scholar).In contrast, the interaction and functional cooperation between the archaeal chaperonin and prefoldin is comparably less understood. The archaeal chaperones represent a powerful model system for examining their functional cooperation because of their simple subunit composition and structural stability.We have already reported that the prefoldin from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhPFD) functionally cooperates with chaperonins in the refolding of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in vitro (26Okochi M. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 769-774Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the interaction between a prefoldin and a chaperonin from hyperthermophilic archaea by immunoprecipitation, single molecule observation, and surface plasmon resonance, and characterized the substrate and chaperonin binding site of prefoldin. Our results reveal that both the distal N- and C-terminal regions of the β subunit are important for substrate binding and also for interaction with a chaperonin. Importantly, the dual function of the prefoldin tips (substrate and chaperonin binding) may represent an important property that facilitates the functional cooperation with a chaperonin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids, Bacterial Strains, and Reagents—The plasmid pT7Blue T (Novagen) was used for cloning and DNA sequencing of the gene. The plasmid pET23b (Novagen) was used for construction of the expression system. Escherichia coli strains used in this study were DH5α for the preparation of plasmids and BL21(DE3) for expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Restriction enzymes, Ex TaqDNA polymerase and other reagents for gene manipulation were purchased from Takara Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). Citrate synthase (CS) from porcine heart, bovine serum albumin, glucose oxidase, and catalase were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were of analytical grade, and solutions were made up in ultrapure water.Proteins—Both wild-type and mutated PhPFDs were prepared by reconstitution from purified subunits. Truncation mutant genes were prepared by PCR amplification from the wild-type gene using the primers (wtα, PH0527Fw 5′-CAT-ATG-ATA-AGG-ATG-GCT-CAG-AA-3′, PH0527Rv 5′-GGA-TCC-CTAC-TTC-TTA-ACC-TTA-AAG-C-3′; tc8α, PH0527Fw, PH0527tc8Rv 5′-TTG-GAT-CCC-TAA-CTT-TGC-TTT-TGC-TGT-A-3′; tn17α, PH0527tn17Fw 5′CAT-ATG-TAC-CAG-GTT-TTA-CAA-GCT-CAA-G-3′, PH0527Rv; wtβ, PH0532Fw 5′-CAT-ATG-CAG-AAC-ATT-CCT-CCC-CA-3′, PH0532Rv 5′-GTC-GAC-TCA-GCC-AGC-GGT-AGG-CGG-CC-3′; tc5β, PH0532Fw, PH0532tc5Rv 5′-GTC-GAC-TCA-CCT-CAG-AGC-GGC-TTG-AAT-CTT-3′; tc6β, PH0532Fw, PH0532tc6Rv 5′-GTC-GAC-TCA-CAG-AGC-GGC-TTG-AAT-CTT-CTG-3′; tc7β, PH0532Fw, PH0532tc7Rv 5′-GTC-GAC-TCA-AGC-GGC-TTG-AAT-CTT-CTG-AG-3′; tc8β, PH0532Fw, PH0532tc8Rv 5′-TTG-TCG-ACT-CAG-GCT-TGA-ATC-TTC-TGA-G-3′; tn10β, PH0532tn10Fw 5′-CAT-ATG-CTT-GGC-CAA-CTC-GAT-ACG-TAT-C-3′, PH0532Rv). The constructs were designated according to the terminus, number of residues, and subunit type that was mutagenized, as exemplified by tc8α, a mutant α subunit with an 8-amino acid truncation from the C terminus, and tn17α, a mutant α subunit of with a 17-amino acid truncation from the N terminus. The amplified DNA for the truncation mutant was cloned into pT7Blue T. After sequence confirmation, the gene was excised with NdeI and BamHI (α subunit) or NdeI and SalI (β subunit), and inserted into pET23b. A mutant β subunit, L111A, denoting an amino acid substitution of Leu111 by Ala, was prepared by a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit using the primers (PH0532L111AFw 5′-GAT-TCA-AGC-CGC-TGC-GAG-GCC-GCC-TAC-CGC-3′, PH0532L111ARv 5′-GCG-GTA-GGC-GGC-CTC-GCA-GCG-GCT-TGA-ATC-3′). The construct was also verified by DNA sequencing.Each subunit was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). After removal of most E. coli proteins by heat treatment at 80 °C for 30 min, it was purified by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) using buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA) with a gradient of NaCl, and subsequent gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. PhPFD complexes were reconstituted by incubating the mixture of the purified α and β subunits at the molar ratio of 1:2 at 80 °C for 30 min. The reconstituted complex was purified by gel filtration on a Bio-Prep column (Bio-Rad). The purified complex contained α and β subunits at the molar ratio of 1:2 as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis.Chaperonins from Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 (PhCPN), Thermococcus sp strain KS-1 (TkCPN), and Thermus thermophilus HB8 (TthCPN) were expressed and purified as described previously (17Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Maruyama T. Odaka M. Yohda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44959-44965Google Scholar, 26Okochi M. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 769-774Google Scholar). 2M. Okochi, H. Matsuzaki, T. Nomura, N. Ishii, and M. Yohda, manuscript in preparation. Wild-type prefoldin from M. thermoautotrophicum, MtPFD, was prepared as described previously (22Leroux M.R. Fandrich M. Klunker D. Siegers K. Lupas A.N. Brown J.R. Schiebel E. Dobson C.M. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6730-6743Google Scholar).The GFP used in this report is a heat-stable mutant, with alanine inserted in the N-terminal region, a His tag in the C-terminal region, and amino acid substitution of F99S, M153T, V163A, and L165F (5Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Google Scholar, 27Sakikawa C. Taguchi H. Makino Y. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21251-21256Google Scholar). It was purified as described previously (28Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of Prefoldin with Anti-chaperonin Antibody— The immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using IMMU-NOcatcher (CytoSignal) to examine the interactions between the prefoldin and the chaperonin in the presence or absence of denatured GFP. The anti-TkCPN antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation. Because of the high sequence homology between TkCPN and PhCPN, the anti-TkCPN antibody can specifically immunoprecipitate PhCPN. The preparation and purification of the antibody were described previously (29Yoshida T. Ideno A. Hiyamuta S. Yohda M. Maruyama T. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1406-1413Google Scholar). The sample solutions for the immunoprecipitation containing 7.0 μm PhPFD and 10 mm HCl-unfolded GFP (at the specified concentration) were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of 1.4 μm PhCPN. The samples were incubated at 65 °C for an additional 10 min. Then, 10 μl of anti-TkCPN antibody was added to 210 μl of the sample solution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Protein A/G resin (10 μl) was then applied to the mixture and incubated for 45 min. Proteins bound to the resin were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample solution. After incubation for 15 min, the bound proteins were collected by centrifugation and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.Preparation of Fluorescent-labeled Proteins—We prepared a mutant TkCPN with amino acid replacement of Asn472 by cysteine (TkCPN472C). This mutation site was selected on the basis of the criterion that the residue is fully exposed to solvent, minimizing the effect on the function of the chaperonin. TkCPN472C was treated with 5 mm dithiothreitol to reduce the cysteine residue. Dithiothreitol was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2). TkCPN472C was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 C5 maleimide (Alexa488, Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. PhPFD was labeled with Cy5 Mono-reactive Dye (Amersham Biosciences) by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Amino groups of PhPFD were modified with Cy5. The labeled TkCPN472C (488-TkCPN) and PhPFD (Cy5-PhPFD) were separated from the unreacted reagents by gel filtration. The extent of labeling was determined by adsorption spectroscopy. The molar ratios of Alexa488 to TkCPN (16-mer) and that of Cy5 to PhPFD (6-mer) were 2.6 and 0.9, respectively. The 488 labeled TkCPN showed the same ATPase activity as that of the non-labeled TkCPN472C (data not shown). Cy5-PhPFD exhibited nearly the same activity in protecting CS from thermally induced aggregation compared with non-labeled PFD (data not shown).Single-molecule Imaging of CPN·PFD Complex—100 nm 488-TkCPN was incubated with 100 nm Cy5-PhPFD at 60 °C for 10 min in buffer A. The resulting solution was diluted by 100-fold (i.e. 1 nm complex) with buffer A containing the oxygen scavenger system (25 mm glucose, 2.5 μm glucose oxidase, 10 nm catalase, and 10 mm dithiothreitol) and flowed into a flow cell made from a glass slide and coverslip for the successive fluorescent observation at room temperature.The positions of individual 488-TkCPN and Cy5-PhPFD molecules adsorbed on the glass slide were visualized by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) (30Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Google Scholar). 488-TkCPN molecules were illuminated with a semiconductor laser (6.0 milliwatts, 473 nm, model ML0250A; Nippon Avionic Co. Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Cy5-PhPFD molecules were illuminated with a He-Ne laser (2.8 milliwatts, 632.8 nm, model GLG5350; NEC Co., Tokyo, Japan). The fluorescence emission from the specimen was collected with an oil-immersion microscope objective (1.40 numerical objective, ×100, PlanApo; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Images were taken by a silicon-intensified tube camera (C2400–08, Hamamatsu Photonics, Shizuoka, Japan) coupled to an image intensifier (VS4-1845, Video Scope International) and recorded on videotapes for subsequent analysis. At least two fields of images were recorded for each assay, and statistical analysis was made from five independent assays. The positions of 488-TkCPN and Cy5-PhPFD at the same fields were marked individually using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.).Surface Plasmon Resonance Detection of Prefoldin-Chaperonin Interaction—The surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed with a Biacore J biosensor system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at the sensor temperature of 25 °C. PhPFD or PhCPN was coupled to the sensor chip (CM5 research grade) via standard N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide activation. For immobilizing chaperonins, 190 μl of 50 μg/ml protein in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was injected on the sensor surface. 190 μl of 6 μg/ml prefoldin in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was injected on the sensor surface to immobilize prefoldin. Ethanolamine was then injected to quench the unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide groups. The mobile phase buffer used was HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% surfactant P-20). Analytes were injected at various concentrations, and the bound analytes were removed by washing with buffer 180 s after the injection.Kinetic Analysis of Sensorgram Data—Kinetic constants were calculated from the sensorgram with BIAevaluation software, version 3.1 (Biacore), according to the global fitting model. The response curves for various analyte concentrations were globally fitted to several binding models provided with the above software. Apparent rate constants (kon1 and koff1 for the first step; kon2 and koff2 for the second step) were calculated based on the best fitted model, the bivalent model (first step: L + A ↔ L · A; second step: L · A + L ↔ L2 · A (L: ligand, A: analyte)). Dissociation constants (KD) were calculated by the resonance unit at equilibrium using the equation, Req = Rmax · C/(C + KD), where Req is equilibrium resonance units, Rmax is the resonance signal at saturation, and C is the concentration of free analyte. By dividing the KD values by that for the wild-type PhPFD, relative KD values were calculated.Thermal Aggregation Measurements of CS—Thermal aggregation of CS from porcine heart was monitored by measuring the light scattering at 500 nm with a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 50 °C with continuous stirring. Monitoring started after addition of CS (80 nm as a monomer) to 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, with or without 240 nm of wild-type or mutant PhPFD complexes preincubated at 50 °C. Activity for protecting CS from thermal aggregation was defined as the relative reduction of light scattering by the presence of PhPFD complexes after 200 s.Fluorometric Monitoring of GFP Refolding—The refolding of GFP denatured in 12.5 mm HCl was monitored by the fluorescence at 510 nm with excitation at 396 nm using a spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5300PC). Fluorescent measurements were initiated with the addition of 15 μm native or acid-denatured GFP (10 μl) into 1.5 ml of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm MgCl2) at 60 °C and under continuous stirring. To observe the chaperone activities, PhPFD complexes were added in the dilution buffer at a molar ratio of 1:5 (denatured GFP:prefoldin). Activity for arresting GFP refolding was defined as the relative reduction of fluorescence by the presence of PhPFD complexes after 600 s.Other Methods—Proteins were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (SDS-PAGE) or polyacrylamide gels without SDS (Native-PAGE). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford with bovine serum albumin as the standard (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar).RESULTSSubstrate-independent Interaction of Archaeal Prefoldin with Its Chaperonin—A major question regarding the functional nature of the interaction between prefoldin and its cognate chaperonin is whether ternary complexes involving a substrate protein are required for efficient prefoldin-chaperonin interactions to take place. A potential affinity between the chaperonin and prefoldin from P. horikoshii (PhCPN and PhPFD, respectively), in the presence or absence of a denatured substrate protein, was investigated using immunoprecipitation experiments. Using purified chaperone components, immunoprecipitations were carried out with an antibody (anti-TkCPN), which specifically recognizes PhCPN, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). In the absence of the denatured protein substrate, an interaction between PhPFD and PhCPN was observed (Fig. 1, lane 5). In contrast, a control experiment showed that only a trace amount of PhPFD was immunoprecipitated by anti-chaperonin antibody in the absence of PhCPN (lane 6). When PhCPN was mixed with PhPFD preincubated with acid-denatured GFP (a known substrate for PhPFD; see Ref. 26Okochi M. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 769-774Google Scholar), both PhPFD and the denatured GFP were co-precipitated with PhCPN (lane 3). Even in the presence of excess denatured GFP (final concentration; 21 μm), the amount of co-precipitated PhPFD was not altered (lane 4). Together, these results suggest that the archaeal prefoldin directly interacts with the chaperonin and that the interaction is not substantially affected by the presence of denatured proteins.Single Molecule Observation of Prefoldin and Chaperonin Complex Formation—We next sought to confirm the interaction between the archaeal prefoldin and a chaperonin by directly observing their association at the level of a single molecule. The α chaperonin from Thermococcus sp. strain KS-1 (TkCPN) was used in this experiment, because we previously determined its crystal structure (15Shomura Y. Yoshida T. Iizuka R. Maruyama T. Yohda M. Miki K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1265-1278Google Scholar), which enabled us to select an appropriate position for labeling with a fluorescent dye (Alexa488). Equimolar amounts (100 nm) of fluorescently labeled TkCPN (488-TkCPN) and Cy5-labeled PhPFD (Cy5-PhPFD) were incubated at 60 °C, where both protein complexes are stable, and their individual signals were observed on a slide glass using a total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) system (30Funatsu T. Harada Y. Tokunaga M. Saito K. Yanagida T. Nature. 1995; 374: 555-559Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The location of TkCPN was identified by the fluorescence of Alexa488 and that of PhPFD by the fluorescence of Cy5, respectively. Approximately 30% of the Alexa488 spots were found to be superimposed on Cy5 spots, directly indicating that a significant fraction of the two chaperones formed binary complexes in the absence of substrate. Our findings indicate that, as with the eukaryotic prefoldin-chaperonin system (24Martin-Benito J. Boskovic J. Gomez-Puertas P. Carrascosa J.L. Simons C.T. Lewis S.A. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Valpuesta J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6377-6386Google Scholar, 32Siegers K. Waldmann T. Leroux M.R. Grein K. Shevchenko A. Schiebel E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 75-84Google Scholar), the archaeal counterparts likely cooperate through direct interactions to facilitate the folding of non-native polypeptides.Fig. 2Fluorescence micrographs of the complexes between 488-TkCPN and Cy5-PhPFD. Both upper and lower panels (A and B) were obtained from the same field. 488-TkCPNs are observed in the left panels (Alexa488 fluorescence), and Cy5-PhPFD are also identified in the right panels (Cy5 fluorescence). The co-incident spots, which represent the prefoldin-chaperonin complexes, are marked by the arrows in the right panels. The final concentrations of 488-TkCpn and Cy5-PhPFD were both 1 nm.

When PhCPN was immobilized on the sensor chip, PhPFD produced a concentration-dependent signal (Fig. 3A). The interaction was found to be reversible, because the signal returned to a base level ∼200 s after the removal of PhPFD. When PhPFD was immobilized, the signal also augmented when an increasing concentration of PhCPN was added to the mobile phase (Fig. 3B). The release of PhCPN was slow, however, and a considerable amount of PhCPN remained on the sensor chip even 200 s after the wash with buffer (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Sensorgrams of affinity measurements between Ph-CPN and PhPFD by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. A, PhCPN was immobilized on a Biacore biosensor chip to be 19,000 RU, and PhPFD at 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.09 μm were injected as the analytes. B, PhPFD was immobilized on a Biacore biosensor chip to be 4,500 RU, and 0.025, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.25 μm PhCPN were injected as the analytes. Sensorgrams with different concentrations of prefoldin and fitting to the bivalent analyte model are indicated by solid and dotted lines, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The binding curves were fitted using various models using the BIAevaluation 3.1 software; when either PhPFD or PhCPN were immobilized on the sensor, the best fits were obtained with the bivalent analyte model (Fig. 3, A and B). Global fittings of the data using the bivalent model yielded χd values of 23.3 for immobilized PhCPN and 6.99 for immobilized PhPFD, respectively, which were optimal compared with all other tested models. Apparent association and dissociation rate constants obtained from the fitted data models are shown in Table I. The rate constants for the first step (L + A ↔ L · A) for both experiments using PhPFD and PhCPN immobilized sensor chips are close to each other, but not identical. The discrepancy"
https://openalex.org/W1972839212,"We have shown that chronic elevated glucose (25 mm) increases monocyte adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells (EC). This increased adhesion is mediated primarily through induction of interleukin (IL)-8 via activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (Srinivasan, S., Yeh, M., Danziger, E. C., Hatley, M. E., Riggan, A. E., Leitinger, N., Berliner, J. A., and Hedrick, C. C. (2003) <i>Circ. Res.</i> 92, 371–377). In the current study, we identified the elements in the AP-1 transcriptional complex that are activated by glucose. These elements include c-Jun, c-Fos, and Fra-1. AP-1 is activated by cellular oxidative stress, and we have reported significant production of ROS by high glucose-cultured cells. We examined signaling pathways upstream of AP-1 in EC that lead to AP-1 activation by HG. EC cultured in 25 mm glucose had a 2-fold increase in p38 phosphorylation compared with control normal glucose-cultured EC. Inhibition of the p38 pathway using 5 μm SB203580 significantly reduced glucose-mediated IL-8 mRNA production by 60%. Furthermore, blocking p38 pathway activation using a dominant-negative p38 construct significantly reduced glucose-mediated monocyte adhesion by 50%. Thus, glucose-stimulated monocyte adhesion is primarily regulated through phosphorylation of p38 with subsequent activation of AP-1, leading to IL-8 production. To study this pathway in the setting of diabetes, we used the db/db mouse. P38 phosphorylation was increased in diabetic db/db mice compared with control mice. We found a dramatic elevation in plasma levels of KC, the mouse ortholog of IL-8 in diabetic db/db mice (1800 ± 100 pg/ml KC in db/db <i>versus</i> 300 ± 75 pg/ml in C57BL/6J control mice, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Inhibition of the p38 pathway in diabetic db/db mice significantly reduced monocyte adhesion by 50%. Taken together, these data indicate that chronic elevated glucose in diabetes activates the p38 MAP kinase pathway to increase inflammatory IL-8 gene induction and monocyte/endothelial adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2110454012,"Ninety percent of all human lung cancers are related to cigarette smoking. Both tobacco smoke and lung tumorigenesis are associated with drastically reduced levels of Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10), a multifunctional secreted protein, naturally produced by the airway epithelia of virtually all mammals. We previously reported that the expression of CC10 is markedly reduced in animals exposed to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, NNK, a potent carcinogen in tobacco smoke. Furthermore, it has been reported that CC10 expression, induced in certain tumor cells, reverses the transformed phenotype. We demonstrate here that NNK exposure of CC10-knock-out (CC10-KO) mice causes a significantly higher incidence of airway epithelial hyperplasia and lung adenomas compared with wild type (WT) littermates (30% CC10-KO versus 5% WT, p = 0.041). We also found that compared with NNK-treated WT mice, CC10-KO mice manifest increased frequency of K-ras mutation, elevated level of Fas ligand (FasL) expression, and increased MAPK/Erk phosphorylation, all of which are considered predisposing events in NNK-induced lung tumorigenesis.

To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild type (WT) and CC10-knockout (KO) mice to NNK and compared the rate of lung adenoma formation in these two groups of animals. In addition, we determined whether compared with WT mice NNK treatment of the CC10-KO mice caused: (a) epithelial hyperproliferation, (b) a higher incidence of mutations in the proto-oncogene, K-ras, (c) a higher level of FasL expression, and (d) increased phosphorylation of MAPK/Erk1, all of which are associated with lung tumorigenesis. Our results show that compared with the lungs of NNK-treated WT mice, those of the NNK-treated CC10-KO mice manifest: (i) a markedly higher incidence of airway epithelial hyperplasia and the formation of adenomas, (ii) a markedly increased frequency of K-ras mutations, (iii) a significantly higher level of FasL expression, and (iv) an increased phosphorylation of MAPK/Erk1. We propose that CC10 plays a critical role in protecting the lungs against NNK-induced hyperplasia and adenoma formation, most likely by suppressing the events that are known to precede tumorigenesis in this organ.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals, Exposure, and Tissue Collection—CC10-KO mice (21Zhang Z.

Science. 1997; 276: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were generated by gene targeting in embryonic stem cells. The strain- and age-matched C57BL/6 WT mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed under standard conditions in a National Institutes of Health animal facility. All procedures were approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee. Starting at 8 weeks of age, the mice received NNK intraperitoneally (104 mg/kg of body weight, three times, given every other month) or physiological saline, respectively. The animals were serially sacrificed at 5 and 8 months and at 11 and 12 months. These time periods were chosen because it has been reported that aging B6 and 129 mouse strains spontaneously develop cancers in various organs, including the lung, at a high frequency (22Haines D.C. Chattopadhyay S. Ward J.M. Toxicol. Pathol. 2001; 29: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two hours prior to sacrifice, mice received 100 μg/g 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Sigma) intraperitoneally. Representative tissue specimens were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained, and embedded in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. compound (Miles Laboratories Inc., Elkhart, IN) before freezing or snapfrozen in dry ice-cooled 2-methylbutane and stored at –140 °C for molecular analysis as described below.Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was performed essentially as described previously (4Linnoila R.I. Jensen S.M. Steinberg S.M. Mulshine J.L. Eggleston J.C. Gazdar A.F. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 97: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibodies anti-CC10 (diluted 1:10,000; a gift from Dr. Francesco De-Mayo, Baylor School of Medicine, Houston, TX), anti-surfactant-associated protein C (SP-C, diluted 1:100, Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA), anti-Fas (diluted 1:3000), anti-FasL (diluted 1:1000, both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Ki67 (diluted 1:1000, Novocastra, Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle, UK), and rat anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (diluted 1:300, Accurate Chemical Science, NY). Expression levels of CC10, Fas, and FasL were analyzed with a Nikon Eclipse 400® microscope and Metamorph® software. Proliferation indexes were generated by counting BrdUrd or Ki67-labeled nucleus per 2000–3000 cells per animal lung with a Nikon Eclipse 400® microscope. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann Whitney U test.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Snap-frozen lung tissues were homogenized by ultrasonication in lysis buffer composed of PBS, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% proteinase and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). The levels of CC10 in the lung lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation as described previously (17Szabo E. Goheer A. Witschi H. Linnoila R.I. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 475-485PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of Erk1/2 were directly immunoblotted with a rabbit anti-ERK1 antibody (diluted 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and the levels of phospho-MAPK and phospho-Elk1 were assessed, respectively, using a rabbit anti-phospho-MAPK polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:1500; New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and a Phospho Plus Elk1 Antibody Kit (New England Biolabs, Inc.) as described in the manufacturer's procedures. The levels of CC10, Erk1, phospho-MAPK and phospho-Elk1 were quantified with a Densitometer (Pharmaceutical Biotech).DNA Isolation and Laser Capture Microdissection—About 500 cells from adenomas and airway epithelia were acquired from deparaffinized sections using PixCell I (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA) laser capture microdissection. DNA was purified according to manufacturer's procedures and used for amplification of K-Ras DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described below.Single-strand Conformational Polymorphism (SSCP)—The SSCP analysis was based on the methods described previously (23Gochuico B.R. Miranda K.M. Hessel E.M. De Bie J.J. Van Oosterhout A.J. Cruikshank W.W. Fine A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L444-L449PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 143-base pair K-ras exon 1 DNA fragment was yielded by PCR using primers RasE1F (5′-TTA TTG TAA GGC CTG CTG AA-3′) and RasE1R (5′-GCA GCG TTA CCT CTA TCG TA-3′). In addition, a 192-base pair K-ras exon 2 DNA fragment was generated with primers RasE2F (5′-TTCTCAGGACTCCTACAGGA-3′) and RasE2R (5′-ACC CAC CTA TAA TGG TGA AT-3′). PCR was carried out in a 20-μl PCR reaction mixture containing 3 μl of DNA prepared by laser capture microdissection, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 0.4 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 0.4 μl of a 10 μm concentration of each primer, 0.4 μl of [32P]dCTP (20 μCi/μl) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). Each sample was subjected to 35 cycles, and each cycle consisted of denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 45 s, and extending at 72 °C for 90 s, with a final step at 72 °C for 8 min. An equal amount of PCR product was mixed with 2× SSCP loading buffer (98% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) and denatured at 95 °C for 5 min. Four μl of each sample was loaded onto the SSCP gel (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) and run at 6 watts for 16 h in 0.6× TBE at room temperature. The SSCP gels were dried and exposed to autoradiography film.DNA Sequencing—Mutant DNA derived from a variant SSCP band was amplified by PCR with the primers RasE1F and RasE1R. The amplified DNA was then purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and an ABI PRISM DNA sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).RESULTSMorphology of Epithelial Cells in the Airways of WT and CC10-KO Mice before and after NNK Treatment—To assess the effects of NNK on WT and CC10-KO mouse lungs, we first examined the morphology of airway epithelium and CC10 level (Fig. 1). As expected, while high levels of CC10 expression in the lungs of WT mice are readily detectable (Fig. 1A), none of the airway epithelial cells of CC10-KO mice were positive for CC10 (Fig. 1B). The Clara cells of CC10-KO mice showed a marked reduction in apical cytoplasm, normally the storage site for CC10 protein (Fig. 1, C–F). Most importantly, the NNK treatment of WT mice leads to a precipitous reduction in the levels of lung CC10 as assessed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1G) and by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1H). Morphologically, the apical cytoplasm of bronchial epithelial cells in NNK-treated CC10–/–mice remain flat. These results indicate that CC10 deficiency leads to morphological changes in lung epithelial cells of CC10-KO mice and that NNK treatment of WT mice markedly reduces the production of this protein in the lung.At 5–8 months after NNK treatment, histopathology revealed focal airway epithelial hyperplasia in 33% (4 of 12 mice) and solitary lung adenomas in 25% (3 of 12 mice) of the CC10-KO animals (Table I). At 11–12 months after NNK exposure, epithelial hyperplasia and small solitary lung adenomas were induced in 38% (3 of 8) of the CC10-KO mice (Table I). All NNK-induced lung adenomas in CC10-KO mice were solitary, less than 1 mm in diameter, and of alveolar type II cell lineage (Fig. 2, A–C). Moreover, compared with the cells surrounding the alveoli proliferating cells in adenomas are markedly increased as suggested by an elevated BrdUrd index (Fig. 2, D and E). Only one out of 22 NNK-treated WT mice developed a solitary lung adenoma (p = 0.041). These results indicate that CC10-KO mice are more prone to developing hyperplasia and lung adenomas than their WT counterparts following exposure to NNK.Table IDevelopment of lung epithelial hyperplasia and adenomas in NNK-treated CC10-KO miceTreatmentGenotype (n)Duration of treatment (months)Mice with hyperplasiaMice with adenomasNNKKO(12)5-84 (33%)3 (25%)NNKWT(12)5-801PBSKO(6)5-800PBSWT(12)5-800NNKKO(8)11-123 (38%)3 (38%)NNKWT(10)11-1200PBSKO(6)11-1201PBSWT(10)11-1200 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2Photomicrographs of NNK-induced lung tumors in CC10-KO mice.

Note the location in the alveolar compartment without any apparent connection with the airways (hematoxylin-eosin stain, ×15). B, higher magnification (×200) reveals a tubular adenoma with minimal atypia. C, tumor cells are positive for a type II pneumocyte marker SP-C, suggesting alveolar type II cell lineage of the tumor (immunoperoxidase stain, ×700). D, BrdUrd index in the adenomas was increased 5-fold, compared with the surrounding alveoli, while there was no significant difference in tumors or surrounding alveoli between NNK-treated KO and WT mice (immunoperoxidase staining, ×100). E, numerous tumor cells displayed Ki-67 immunoreactivity (immunoperoxidase staining, ×100). Throughout the lung tissue including adenomas, Ki-67-positive cells were observed at higher numbers than BrdUrd-positive cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NNK-treated CC10-KO Manifest a Markedly Elevated Level of Proliferation of Airway Epithelial Cells—We next determined whether lack of CC10 protein had changed the cellular dynamics in the pulmonary epithelia following NNK treatment by studying cell proliferation. Again, at 5–6 months after treatment, about 1.5 and 0.91% of BrdUrd-positive epithelial cells appeared in the airways and alveoli, respectively, of the NNK-treated KO mice (Fig. 3, A and B). This reflected a 3–10-fold increase in the bronchiolar epithelium, as compared with 0.45% of BrdUrd-positive cells in NNK-treated WT mice (p = 0.016), 0.13% in PBS-treated KO mice (p = 0.036), and 0.37% in PBS-treated WT mice (data not shown). These results were confirmed by immunostaining using the cellular proliferation marker Ki-67. There was a 2–6-fold increase in the Ki-67 labeling index in the lungs of NNK-treated CC10-KO, as compared with NNK-treated WT mice, PBS-treated CC10-KO, and WT mice (data not shown). These data suggest that hyperproliferation induced by NNK in KO mice may be responsible for higher incidence of lung adenomas.Fig. 3CC10-KO mice manifest hyperproliferation of airway epithelium and increased FasL expression. Bronchiolar epithelia of mice exposed to 5 months of NNK are shown. A, WT mouse with a single labeled cell (arrow). It should be noted that no statistically significant differences between WT and CC10-KO mice were detected in PBS-treated control groups, although the lung BrdUrd labeling index was 3-fold lower in the airways of CC10-KO mice compared with those in WT mice. B, NNK-exposed KO mouse with numerous labeled bronchiolar cells (arrows), resulting in a significantly higher (up to 10-fold) labeling index than in WT mice. (A and B, immunoperoxidase staining for BrdUrd, ×100.) In contrast, no statistically significant difference of BrdUrd labeling index in the lung was found in WT animals between NNK treatment and PBS treatment. In the alveolar compartment, following NNK exposure there was a 2–3-fold increase in the labeling index of KO mice, as compared with 0.51% of BrdUrd-positive cells in WT mice (p = 0.029). No statistically significant difference in the alveolar BrdUrd labeling index was found between CC10-KO and WT mice in PBS-treated control groups. C, WT control animal reveals minimal immunoreactivity in the bronchiolar epithelial cells for FasL. D, at 5 months of NNK exposure, there is increased staining in the airway epithelium in CC10-KO animals.

While Fas expression appeared similar among the four treatment groups (data not shown), markedly enhanced FasL immunoreactivity occurred in lungs of NNK-treated CC10-KO mice as compared with a minimal to moderate increase in the lungs of NNK-treated WT mice. Using a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay we determined the level of apoptosis in bronchial epithelia of NNK-treated CC10-KO and WT mice and found that NNK treatment markedly increased the level of apoptosis in CC10-KO mice. 2Y. Yang, Z. Zhang, A. B. Mukherjee, and R. I. Linnoila, unpublished results. Moreover, enhanced immunoreactivity for FasL was also detected within alveolar type II cells and lymphocytes in the hyperplasia and adjacent to tumors in NNK-treated KO mice (Fig. 3, C and D). The results indicate that CC10 protein may have a protective role on cellular stability against NNK-induced cellular biochemical alteration such as FasL overexpression.Increased K-ras Mutation in CC10-KO Lungs—Recent reports indicate that most chemically induced lung tumors (∼90%) in A/J mice carry an activating point mutation in the K-ras proto-oncogene (25Matzinger S.A. Crist K.A. Stoner G.D. Anderson M.W. Pereira M.A. Steele V.E. Kelloff G.J. Lubet R.A. You M. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2487-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Chen B. Liu L. Castonguay A. Maronpot R.R. Anderson M.W. You M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1603-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is an increase in K-ras mutations in the lung tumors of NNK-treated KO mice, we microdissected the tissues and carried out PCR-SSCP and sequencing assay to detect mutations in exons 1 and 2 of this gene. This area contains clusters of the known transformation mutations. We found that three out of six lung adenomas (50%) in NNK-treated CC10-KO mice had K-ras mutations in codon 12 of exon 1 (supplemental Fig. 1), in which GGT was transversed to GCT, resulting in an amino acid change from glycine to alanine. A K-ras mutation at codon 32 was found in a lung adenoma of an NNK-treated WT mouse, in which TAC was transitioned to TAT, resulting in a silent mutation. All three K-ras mutations in NNK-exposed KO mice were early phase alveolar adenomas, suggesting that CC10 deficiency confers susceptibility to NNK-mediated genomic instability such as K-ras mutations, which may contribute to carcinogenesis.Elevated Levels of MAPK/Erk1 Phosphorylation in NNK-treated CC10-KO Mouse Lungs—Since the MAPK cascade, situated downstream from activating ras mutations, plays a critical role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and responses to extracellular signals (27Bonni A.

Pathol. 2000; 156: 1307-1316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we examined the activation stages of MAPK by immunobloting analysis (Fig. 4). We found elevated levels of Erk1 in NNK-treated lungs from both KO and WT mice (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we also found dramatically increased MAPK activity in NNK-treated CC10-KO mouse lungs with adenomas as compared with those in PBS-treated lungs (Fig. 4A). The relative levels of phospho-MAPK in PBS-treated lungs from KO animals were twice as high as from WT mice and enhanced up to 3-fold following the exposure to NNK (Fig. 4B). Western blot analysis of phosphorylated Elk1 also showed similar results. Thus it appears that the lungs of CC10-deficient mice are more sensitive to NNK-induced activation of the MAPK that mediates increased cellular proliferation and cell growth, leading to tumorigenesis.Fig. 4Activation of MAPK kinase pathway associated with NNK exposure in CC10-deficient mice. The levels of Erk1 and phosphorylated MAPK (phospho-MAPK) were analyzed by immunoblotting of lung lysates using state-specific antibodies. A representative gel from three CC10-KO and three WT mice is shown in A. Although the levels were variable, the average levels of Erk1 were unchanged between NNK-and PBS-treated CC10-KO and WT mice. B, the level of phospho-MAPK compared with the total kinase was determined by densitometric analysis and expressed in relative units of phospho-MAPK/ERK1. The level in KO control lung (bar 1) was 2-fold as compared with that of WT control (bar 4), and the exposure to NNK at 8 months was associated with a 3-fold increase in the CC10-KO tumor lung (bar 2) and lung (bar 3) lysates, when compared with the lysates from corresponding WT NNK-treated animals (bars 5 and 6, respectively).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provided evidence that CC10-KO mice are significantly more susceptible to developing hyperproliferation of airway epithelial cells and the formation of pulmonary adenomas in response to NNK-treatment. Smoking remains a significant health hazard throughout the world, and NNK is a potent carcinogen in cigarette smoke. We discovered that mice exposed to this carcinogen express drastically lower levels of CC10 as does cigarette smoking (3Shijubo N. Itoh Y. Yamaguchi T. Shibuya Y. Morita Y. Hirasawa M. Okutani R.

https://openalex.org/W1982708445,"Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, secretes among other virulence factors an adenylate cyclase (AC) toxin that is able to enter into eukaryotic cells where it is activated upon binding to endogenous calmodulin (CaM) and synthesizes supraphysiological cAMP levels. In vivo, the AC toxin, through its specific interaction with the CD11b/CD18 integrin, primarily targets phagocytic cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. Because neutrophil priming and activation result in the production of reactive oxygen species that may cause intracellular oxidation, we have examined the biological consequences of the oxidation of CaM methionines upon its interaction with AC. We show here that the interaction of CaM with AC is dependent on the reduced state of methionines, because oxidation of all methionine residues of CaM dramatically decreases its affinity for AC. Peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases A (MsrA) and B (MsrB) were able to partially reduce the oxidized CaM, and these partially repaired forms could interact with AC nearly as efficiently as the native protein. We further showed that the CaM.AC complex is resistant to oxidation with tert-butylhydroperoxide, and we identified methionine residues 109, 124, and 145 as critical for binding to AC. The resistance of the AC.CaM complex to oxidation and the ability of AC to be efficiently activated by partially oxidized CaM molecules should allow the toxin to exert its cytotoxic effects on activated neutrophils and contribute to the host colonization."

It is recruited to the 43 S complex in the multifactor complex (MFC) with eIF2, eIF3, and eIF5 via multiple interactions with the MFC constituents. Here we show that FLAG epitope tagging of eIF1 at either terminus abolishes its in vitro interactions with eIF5 and eIF2β but not that with eIF3c. Nevertheless, both forms of FLAG-eIF1 fail to bind eIF3 and are incorporated into the 43 S complex inefficiently in vivo.

Subsequent joining of mRNA carried by eIF4F produces the 48 S preinitiation complex. The eIF3 stimulates recruitment of (Met-tRNAiMet)and mRNA to the 40 S ribosome by binding to eIF2 and the eIF4G subunit of eIF4F, either directly or indirectly (for a review, see Ref. 1Hershey J.W.B. Merrick W.C. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 33-88Google Scholar). The 48 S complex searches for the first AUG codon in the mRNA with the help of low molecular weight factors, eIF1 and eIF1A, and the helicase and its cofactor, eIF4A and eIF4B, respectively. Correct base pairing between the (Met-tRNAiMet)anticodon and the AUG codon triggers the hydrolysis of GTP bound to eIF2; this reaction is dependent on the GTPase-activating function of the eIF5 N-terminal domain (NTD). This GTP hydrolysis then leads to dissociation of preassembled eIFs and formation of an initiation complex containing the AUG anticodon base pair in the ribosomal P site. The second GTP-binding protein eIF5B then stimulates joining of the 40 S initiation complex with the 60 S subunit to form the 80 S initiation complex. The elongation of the polypeptide chain starts from the methionine linked to the 80 S initiation complex. eIFs are highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Mammalian eIFs were purified from a high salt wash fraction (e.g. in a 500 mm KCl buffer) of ribosome-associated proteins and characterized in crude mammalian cell extracts or partially or fully reconstituted initiation systems (1Hershey J.W.B.

Despite the progress in elucidating the function of individual eIFs, the precise order of and the key element(s) critical for their assembly in vivo remain to be elucidated. Using yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism, it was proposed that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of eIF5 plays a critical role in the assembly and integrity of the functional 43 and 48 S complexes (4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar, 5Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Google Scholar). eIF5-CTD interacts concurrently with the β subunit of eIF2 and the c subunit of eIF3 via a conserved motif called aromatic/acidic boxes (AA-boxes) 1 and 2 (6Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Google Scholar). Lysine-rich segments (K-boxes) in eIF2β-NTD are responsible for its binding to the eIF5-CTD (6Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Google Scholar). These interactions plus interactions between eIF3c and eIF1 (7Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Google Scholar), between eIF3a and eIF1, and between eIF2β and eIF3a (8Valásek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Google Scholar) were proposed to mediate formation of the multifactor complex (MFC) containing eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, eIF5, and (Met-tRNAiMet)(4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence supports the model that the constituents of the MFC bind to the 40 S ribosome as a preformed unit to form the 43 S complex (5Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Google Scholar, 9Valásek L. Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valásková V. Hinnebusch A.G.

Disruption of MFC by an AA-box 2 mutation in eIF5 leads to a defect in (Met-tRNAiMet)and mRNA binding to the 40 S ribosome in vitro. Evidence also suggests that this mutation impedes a step subsequent to the 43 S complex formation in vivo (5Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Google Scholar). Among the components of the MFC, eIF1 is a small factor (12 kDa) whose importance has just begun to be appreciated. Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that eIF1 is required for discrimination of the 48 S complex against near cognate codon pairing with the (tRNAiMet)anticodon, to ensure initiation from AUG only (2Pestova T.V. Borukhov S.I. Hellen C.U.T. Nature. 1998; 394: 854-859Google Scholar, 11Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Google Scholar, 12Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Gene Dev. 2002; 16: 2906-2922Google Scholar). Besides its role in the 48 S complex, in vitro assays using the 40 S ribosome, (Met-tRNAiMet), and a limited set of eIFs indicate that eIF1 stimulates eIF2 TC binding to the 40 S ribosome both in yeast (13Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun S.Z.J. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. RNA. 2002; 8: 382-397Google Scholar) and mammals (14Majumdar R. Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6580-6587Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated mutual interactions of eIF1 with other components in the MFC and found that eIF1 binds to the other two components of MFC, eIF2β and eIF5, in addition to eIF3c, as was previously shown (7Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Google Scholar). These newly identified eIF1 interactions, but not that with eIF3c, are significantly reduced by tagging of eIF1 with the highly charged FLAG peptide at either terminus. The FLAG-tagged forms of eIF1 reduce binding to eIF3 and are recruited to the 40 S ribosome inefficiently. C-terminal FLAG-eIF1 produces a recessive lethal phenotype, and its overexpression severely impedes 43 S complex formation. N-terminal FLAG-eIF1 overexpression also compromises 43 S complex formation and reduces eIF2 binding to the 40 S ribosome. Together these results provide firm evidence that eIF1 plays an important role in promoting 43 S complex formation in vivo.

The 0.21-kb NcoI-BamHI fragment of p4231 containing the FL-SUI1 ORF 5′-half was subcloned into YCpL-SUI1ΔNco to generate YCpL-FL-SUI1 encoding FL-eIF1 under the natural promoter. The 0.21-kb NcoI-BamHI fragment from PCR with oligo-3 5′-CCC CCATGG ACT ACA AGG ACG ACG ATG ACA AGCTGT CCA TTG AGA ATC TGA AAT C-3′ (to replace the second ATG of FL-eIF1 ORF with CTG; underlined) and oligo-4 5′-CTC CCC CAT TTC TGGATCCTT GAC-3′ (covering the unique BamHI site in SUI1 ORF) was cloned into YCpL-SUI1ΔNco to generate YCpL-FL-SUI1* encoding another version of FLAG-eIF1 designated FL-eIF1*. To introduce an NdeI site at the 5′-end of the SUI1 ORF, YCpL-SUI1ΔNde was prepared similarly to YCpL-SUI1ΔNco except using oligo-5 (5′-CGC GGATCC GACATATGA TTT GCT TCA GCT ATA TTA AT-3′) (with a NdeI site) in place of oligo-2. To make a plasmid encoding C-terminal FLAG-eIF1 (eIF-FL), the NdeI-SalI fragment of SUI1-FL ORF from PCR with oligo-6 (5′-GGC CAT ATG TCC ATT GAG AAT CTG AAA TC-3′) and oligo-7 (5′-CGC GTCGAC TTA TTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC AAA CCC ATG AAT TTT AAT GTT C-3′) and the SalI-HindIII fragment of the SUI1 3′-untranslated region from PCR with oligo-8 (5′-GGC GTCGAC GTT CAA GGC TTA CGC CG-3′) and oligo-9 (5′-CAT AAGCTT GGG ATT CCA TGA TTT-3′) were cloned together into pET23a to generate pET-SUI1-FL. Since this plasmid did not produce 35S-eIF1-FL in T7/TNT system (Promega), we replaced the 0.5-kb AflIII-HindIII fragment of pT7-SUI1 with that of pET-SUI1-FL to generate pT7-SUI1-FL that was used for 35S-eIF1-FL synthesis in the T7/TNT system. The NdeI-SphI fragment of pET-SUI1-FL was cloned into the same sites of YCpL-SUI1ΔNde to generate YCpL-SUI1-FL. The 1.5-kb SacI-SphI fragment of YCpL-FL-SUI1* or YCpL-SUI1-FL was cloned into YEplac181 to generate YEpL-FL-SUI1* or YEpL-SUI1-FL, respectively. Yeast strains KAY146, KAY156, KAY178, and KAY142 were constructed by plasmid shuffling (16Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Google Scholar) using Y217 and the corresponding SUI1 LEU2 plasmids listed in Table II. Biochemical Assays—GST pull-down assays with 35S-labeled proteins, synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate, were conducted as described previously (7Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Google Scholar). The amounts of bound 35S-labeled proteins were quantitated with STORM or TYPHOON PhosphorImagers (Amersham Biosciences). Polyhistidine-tagged eIF5-CTD-(241–405), eIF3c-(1–156), and eIF2β-(1–140) fragments designated His-eIF5-B6, His-NIP1-N, and His-eIF2β-N were expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) carrying pHis-TIF5-B6, pHis-NIP1-N, and pHis-SUI3ΔS, respectively, as described (5Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Google Scholar). FLAG-eIF1 constructs designated FL-eIF1 and eIF1-FL were purified from BL21 (DE3) carrying pET-FL-SUI1 and pET-SUI1-FL, respectively, as described (17Asano K. Lon P. Krishnamoorthy T. Pavitt G.D.E., G. Hannig E.M. Nika J. Donahue T.F. Huang H.-K. Hinnebusch A.G. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 221-247Google Scholar). Peptide sequencing of FL-eIF1 indicated that the majority of its N terminus was blocked, probably by a formyl group attached to the first methionine, whereas a subpopulation of the protein had an unblocked N terminus with the sequence MDYK, confirming its first four amino acids. 2G. Radke, T. Iwamoto, and J. Tomich, unpublished observations. FLAG-tagged eIF2 or HA-tagged eIF3 was affinity-purified from strain KAY42 (gcd6-7A p1780-FL) (6Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Google Scholar) or H2557 transformant carrying pLPY-PRT1His-TIF34HA-TIF35FLAG and pLPY-NIP1-TIF32 (10Phan L. Schoenfeld L.W. Valasek L.

Co-immunoprecipitation was done essentially as described (6Asano K. Krishnamoorthy T. Phan L. Pavitt G.D. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1673-1688Google Scholar) with the following modification. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared in buffer A, but immune complex binding and washing were done in buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100. Polysome analysis was conducted as described previously (4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar, 5Asano K. Shalev A. Phan L. Nielsen K. Clayton J. Valasek L. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2326-2337Google Scholar). To quantitate the amount of factors in the precipitated fractions, we used WCE prepared from a wild type strain (KAY146) as a standard, based on the following information. Using purified FL-eIF1 as a reference, we determined that 40 μg of WCE contains 3.6 pmol of eIF1 (see Fig. 3A). Because the intracellular molar ratio of eIF1, eIF2, eIF3, and eIF5 is 1:0.77:0.65:0.82 in our WCE, 3H. He, C. R. Singh, and K. Asano, unpublished data. the same amount of WCE was calculated to contain 2.8, 1.9, and 3.0 pmol of eIF2, eIF3, and eIF5, respectively. The amounts of precipitated eIFs were determined in reference to these values. We determined individual eIF levels by anti-FLAG immunoblotting of WCE prepared from strains encoding FLAG-eIF1, -eIF2β, -eIF3c, or -eIF5 as its sole source. 3H. He, C. R. Singh, and K.

GCN4 translational control in KAY142 (GPDFL-SUI1) was tested by assaying β-galactosidase from its transformant carrying p180 (GCN4::lacZ) or its derivative p226 or p227 (20Mueller P.P. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1986; 45: 201-207Google Scholar). The results of these experiments were described in Ref. 21, He, H.

Master's thesis, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KSGoogle Scholar. All of the biochemical assays were done at least three times, and a typical result is shown. Yeast eIF1 Interacts with eIF5-CTD via AA-boxes and eIF2β-NTD via K-boxes—It was previously reported that a GST fusion form of eIF5-CTD (165 amino acids), known as GST-eIF5-B6, can interact with 35S-labeled eIF1, synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3). Because eIF1 stimulates eIF2 TC binding to the ribosome (13Algire M.A. Maag D. Savio P. Acker M.G. Tarun S.Z.J. Sachs A.B. Asano K. Nielsen K.H. Olsen D.S. Phan L. Hinnebusch A.G. Lorsch J.R. RNA. 2002; 8: 382-397Google Scholar, 14Majumdar R. Bandyopadhyay A. Maitra U. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6580-6587Google Scholar, 22Thomas A. Spaan W. van Steeg H. Voorma H.O. Benne R. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 67-71Google Scholar), we also examined whether individual eIF2 subunits can bind eIF1 and found that GST-eIF2β and its C-terminal deletion GST-eIF2β-N (covering amino acids 1–140) specifically bound 35S-eIF1 (Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4). To further examine interactions between eIF1 and eIF5 or eIF2β, the bacterial extract containing a recombinant form of eIF1 (r-eIF1) was incubated with GST-eIF5-B6, GST-eIF2β-N, GST-eIF3c-N, or GST alone. GST-eIF3c-N contains the N-terminal 156 amino acids of eIF3c, sufficient for eIF1 binding (4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar), and was used as a positive control. GST fusion proteins bound to r-eIF1 were one-step purified with glutathione and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1C, top panel, Coomassie staining of the eluted proteins indicates that GST-eIF3c-N (lane 6), but not GST alone (lane 4), specifically bound to a nearly stoichiometric amount of r-eIF1, whereas no protein from mock-induced extracts bound to GST-eIF3c-N (lane 5). Under these conditions, GST-eIF5-B6 and GST-eIF2β-N bound recombinant eIF1, albeit weakly as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 1C, bottom panel, lanes 9 and 12; note that 5 times less eluted fraction was analyzed in lanes 5–7 than in lanes 8–13). Therefore, r-eIF1 binds GST-eIF5-B6 and GST-eIF2β-N. The treatment of the GST fusion complexes with RNase A prior to the elution step did not reduce these interactions (Fig. 1C, lanes 7, 10, and 13), ruling out the possibility that r-eIF1 was tethered to the proteins via RNA fortuitously bound to r-eIF1 or the GST fusion protein. As mentioned above, the new interactions of eIF1 with eIF2β and eIF5 are weaker than the previously known interaction between eIF1 and eIF3c (Fig. 1C). However, it is these weaker interactions that contribute to cooperative formation of eIF1·eIF2β·eIF5 subcomplex in the MFC, as shown in Fig. 1, E and F. Consistent with this model, FLAG epitope tagging of eIF1 compromises these interactions, leading to inefficient incorporation of FLAG-eIF1 into the MFC (see Fig. 2C). Both the novel interactions of eIF1 depend on the AA-boxes of eIF5 and K-boxes of eIF2β, because the interaction between GST-eIF5-B6 and 35S-eIF1 was abolished by the AA-box 1 mutation, tif5-12A, or the AA-box 2 mutation, tif5-7A (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–5), and altering all of the lysines in the K-boxes to alanines reduced GST-eIF2β binding to eIF1 by 4-fold (Fig. 1B, lane 5). We also found that these interactions were salt-sensitive, since they were not detected when a buffer containing 150 mm Na+ was used at the washing step (7Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Google Scholar) instead of a buffer containing 75 mm KCl as employed in Fig. 1 (data not shown). We confirmed, however, that 35S-eIF1 interacts with eIF5-B6 and eIF2β-N in the same binding buffer (7Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Google Scholar) with 100 mm KCl; this salt concentration has been used in a variety of translation initiation assays (23Hinnebusch A.G. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 185-243Google Scholar). The salt sensitivity of these interactions explains our previous failure to identify these interactions. To confirm that eIF1 can bind directly to the trimeric eIF2 complex, we affinity-purified FLAG-tagged eIF2 from yeast and allowed it to bind r-eIF1 expressed from bacteria. The Coomassie-stained gel of the purified eIF2 is shown in Fig. 1D, lane 2. The eIF2·r-eIF1 complex was precipitated with anti-FLAG affinity resin and then analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1D, second panel, r-eIF1 bound specifically to FLAG-eIF2 as detected by anti-eIF1 (lanes 4–9). To examine whether this interaction is mediated by eIF3 or eIF5 associated with FLAG-eIF2, we analyzed the complex with antibodies against eIF2α, eIF3g, and eIF5. As shown in Fig. 1D, bottom two panels, we found little eIF3 and eIF5 in the precipitated FLAG-eIF2 fractions (lanes 6 and 9), whereas the amounts of eIF1 and eIF2α in the FLAG-eIF2·r-eIF1 fraction was judged to be nearly stoichiometric (lane 6), when compared with their amounts in yeast WCE (lane 3). These results indicate that eIF1 can bind native eIF2 as well as its β subunit. eIF2β-NTD Interacts Simultaneously with eIF1 and eIF5-CTD—Having observed separate interactions of eIF1 with eIF2β-NTD and eIF5-CTD, we pondered whether these interactions occur simultaneously. If so, the formation of a trimeric eIF1·eIF2·eIF5 complex as a part of MFC would contribute to stable eIF2 TC binding to the 40 S ribosome. Thus, we tested whether the interaction between GST-eIF5-B6 and eIF1 can be enhanced by the addition of eIF2β-NTD by a bridging mechanism. As a control, we used the eIF3c-NTD segment, since it is known to bridge the same interaction between GST-eIF5-CTD and eIF1 (4Asano K. Clayton J. Shalev A. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2534-2546Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1E, bottom panel, the eIF2β-N segment increases 35S-eIF1 binding to GST-eIF5-B6 by forming a bridge, as efficiently as the eIF3c-N segment does (top panel). The addition of equivalent amounts of bovine serum albumin did not increase GST-eIF5-B6/35S-eIF1 interaction (data not shown), indicating that the increased interaction in Fig. 1E is not due to increasing the efficiency of the pull downs by nonspecific mechanisms. Thus, eIF2β-NTD binds simultaneously to eIF1 and eIF5-CTD. Likewise, Fig. 1F shows that the His-eIF5-B6 segment can bridge GST-eIF2β-N and 35S-eIF1, thereby enhancing this interaction (compare lanes 2–4), indicating that eIF5-CTD binds simultaneously to eIF1 and eIF2β-NTD. Together, these results support the idea that a trimeric eIF1·eIF2·eIF5 complex can be formed as a part of MFC for stimulation of TC binding to the ribosome. FLAG Tagging of eIF1 Impairs the Interaction with eIF5-CTD, eIF2β-NTD, and the Native eIF3 Complex in Vitro—To analyze the functional significance of a protein interaction in vivo, it is important to obtain a mutation that specifically reduces it. During the course of our study, we noted that some of the interactions involving eIF1 were compromised by its epitope tagging at either terminus with the bulky highly charged FLAG peptide (DYKDDDDK). As shown in Fig. 2A, middle and bottom panels, C-terminally and N-terminally FLAG-tagged eIF1, designated eIF1-FL and FL-eIF1, respectively, had reduced interactions with GST-eIF2β-N and GST-eIF5-B6 (lanes 3 and 6) but not with GST-eIF3c-N (lane 4). In addition, we found that both forms of FLAG-eIF1 had reduced interactions with the C-terminal HEAT domain of eIF4G2 (lane 5) (24He H. von der Haar T. Singh R.C. Ii M. Li B. McCarthy J.E.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Asano K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5441-5445Google Scholar) as well as with the C-terminal domain of eIF3a (GST-TIF32Δ1 (8Valásek L. Nielsen K.H. Hinnebusch A.G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5886-5898Google Scholar); data not shown). To examine the interaction of FLAG-eIF1 derivatives with native eIF3, we affinity-purified native HA epitope-tagged eIF3, attached it to anti-HA affinity resin, and allowed it to bind recombinant forms of eIF1, FL-eIF1, and eIF1-FL in vitro. As shown in Fig. 2B, lane 2, the purified HA-eIF3 contains stoichiometric amounts of a, b, and g subunits of eIF3, a substoichiometric amount of eIF5, and no detectable eIF1. This eIF3 complex bound untagged eIF1 very efficiently but bound FLAG-eIF1s less efficiently. Thus, FLAG tagging of eIF1 reduces the interaction with e"

The discovery that Fur is a zinc metalloprotein and the use of surrogate metals for Fe2+ for in vitro studies question whether Fur is a direct iron sensor. In the present study, we show that the affinity of Fur from Bradyrhizobium japonicum (BjFur) for its target DNA increases 30-fold in the presence of metal, with a Kd value of about 2 nm. DNase I footprinting experiments showed that BjFur protected its binding site within the irr gene promoter in the presence of Fe2+ but not in the absence of metal, showing that DNA binding is Fe2+-dependent. BjFur did not inhibit in vitro transcription from the irr promoter using purified components in the absence of metal, but BjFur repressed transcription in the presence of Fe2+. Thus, BjFur is an iron-responsive transcriptional repressor in vitro. A regulatory Fe2+-binding site (site 1) and a structural Zn2+-binding site (site 2) inferred from the recent crystal structure of Fur from Pseudomonas aeruginosa are composed of amino acids highly conserved in many Fur proteins, including BjFur. BjFur mutants containing substitutions in site 1 (BjFurS1) or site 2 (BjFurS2) bound DNA with high affinity and repressed transcription in vitro in an Fe2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, only a single dimer of BjFurS2 occupied the irr promoter, whereas the wild type and BjFurS1 displayed one- or two-dimer occupancy. We suggest that the putative functions for metal-binding sites deduced from the structure of P. aeruginosa Fur cannot be extrapolated to bacterial Fur proteins as a whole.

We suggest that the putative functions for metal-binding sites deduced from the structure of P. aeruginosa Fur cannot be extrapolated to bacterial Fur proteins as a whole. Control of iron homeostasis is essential to most living organisms. Iron availability can be limited because it is predominantly in the ferric form in aerobic environments. On the other hand, excessive intracellular iron concentration can be deleterious because it generates reactive oxygen species that damage cellular components (1Braun V. Killmann H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 104-109Google Scholar, 2Touati D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 1-6Google Scholar). In bacteria, studies on the control of iron homeostasis have focused largely on Fur (ferric uptake regulator), a regulatory protein that responds to cellular iron (reviewed in Ref. 3Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6223-6229Google Scholar). Fur represses genes involved in high affinity iron transport under iron-replete conditions. It is also involved in numerous other facets of iron metabolism and in processes not obviously linked to iron (4Hall H.K. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5683-5691Google Scholar, 5Stojiljkovic I. Baumler A.J. Hantke K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 531-545Google Scholar, 6Litwin C.M. Calderwood S.B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 137-149Google Scholar).The working model for Fur function posits that, when bound by ferrous (Fe2+) iron, Fur binds the target operator within the promoter of the regulated gene to repress transcription. However, when iron is limited in the cell, the Fur protein is unbound by iron and no longer binds DNA with high affinity; hence, gene expression is derepressed. It was recently shown that binding of Fur to the promoter element is sufficient to block transcription in vitro, and thus Fur probably does not act to recruit another repressor or exclude an activator protein (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar).Several years ago it was discovered that Escherichia coli Fur is a zinc metalloprotein that binds two Zn2+ atoms per monomer (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar). One of the zinc atoms is very tightly bound and is likely to have a structural function, whereas the second zinc can be easily removed with chelators. In addition, Fur containing one Zn2+ atom is sufficient for DNA binding, and the affinity does not increase when the second Zn2+ site is occupied (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar). These observations question whether Fur is a direct iron sensor. Furthermore, most in vitro studies use a surrogate for Fe2+ such as Mn2+ because ferrous iron readily oxidizes to Fe3+ in air. Thus, the assumption that the surrogate metal is a substitute for Fe2+ is equivocal.Several groups have shown that the structural Zn2+ atom of E. coli Fur is coordinated by Cys-92 and Cys-95 (9Gonzalez de Peredo A. Saint-Pierre C. Adrait A. Jacquamet L. Latour J.M. Michaud-Soret I. Forest E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8582-8589Google Scholar, 10Jacquamet L. Aberdam D. Adrait A. Hazemann J.-L. Latour J.-M. Michaud-Soret I. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2564-2571Google Scholar). However, these cysteines are not conserved in many Fur proteins. Very recently, the Fur protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was crystallized in the presence of Zn2+, revealing two metal-binding sites (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Google Scholar). None of the coordinating amino acids composing these sites are cysteine. One of the Zn2+ atoms binds tightly and may be a structural ligand. The second metal-binding site can be occupied by Fe2+ and is a presumptive regulatory metal-binding site. Interestingly, the eight amino acids identified in the two metal-binding sites are highly conserved, leading Pohl et al. (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Google Scholar) to extrapolate their conclusions about the Fur protein from P. aeruginosa to other Fur proteins. Alteration of residues corresponding to some of these metal-binding residues in Fur proteins produces mutant bacterial strains with altered phenotypes (4Hall H.K. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5683-5691Google Scholar, 12Bsat N. Helmann J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4299-4307Google Scholar, 13Delany I. Spohn G. Pacheco A.B. Ieva R. Alaimo C. Rappuoli R. Scarlato V.

O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar, 15Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Google Scholar, 16Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 669-676Google Scholar). However, BjFur also binds to DNA dissimilar to the Fur box within the promoter of the irr gene, whereas E. coli Fur does not bind that element in vitro (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar). The irr gene from B. japonicum encodes Irr, a protein that mediates iron control of heme biosynthesis (17Hamza I. Chauhan S. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J.

Irr expression is controlled both transcriptionally and post-translationally, the former being regulated by BjFur. The amino acids identified in metal binding in P. aeruginosa Fur are conserved in the B. japonicum protein, whereas the cysteines involved in zinc binding in E. coli Fur are not present. In the present study, we demonstrate that BjFur is an iron-responsive DNA-binding protein in vitro and that iron confers on BjFur the ability to repress transcription. Furthermore, we show that the amino acids in BjFur corresponding to the presumptive metal-binding sites of the P. aeruginosa protein are not required for iron-responsive DNA binding or transcriptional repression.MATERIALS AND METHODSChemicals and Reagents—All chemicals were reagent grade and were purchased from Sigma, Fisher, VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA), or J. T. Baker Inc. Agar, purified noble agar, and yeast extract were purchased from Difco, and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Irvine, CA).Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth—E. coli strain DH5α was used for the propagation of plasmids and was grown at 37 °C on Luria-Bertani media with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmid pSKiron contains the 19-mer Fur box consensus sequence 5′-GATAATGATAATCATTATC-3′ cloned into the ClaI site of pBluescript II SK+ (19Ochsner U.A. Vasil A.I. Vasil M.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 7194-7201Google Scholar). pET14bjFur (Novagen, Madison, WI) contains the B. japonicum fur gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14b. B. japonicum fur was derived from parental strain USDA I110 (15Hamza I. Hassett R. O'Brian M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5843-5846Google Scholar). pET14ecFur contains the E. coli fur gene cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET14b.Overexpression and Purification of Fur—Fur was overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(plysS) cells containing fur in pET14b initially grown on Luria-Bertani media containing chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) and ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Cells were inoculated from an overnight culture grown in Luria-Bertani media containing chloramphenicol and ampicillin into 1 liter of fresh 2× YT medium (16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.0) containing antibiotics, 50 μm FeCl3, and 1 mm ZnCl2. Overexpression was induced in cells at mid-log phase by adding 20 ml of 95% ethanol and a final concentration of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubation followed at 20 °C for 4 h with shaking. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 × g, washed in TNG (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, pH 7.4), and resuspended in 15 ml of phosphate binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25.5 μg of aprotinin per 5 g of cells. Cells were disrupted by passage twice through a French pressure cell at 1200 p.s.i. and clarified by centrifugation at 37,000 × g for 45 min. 1 ml of 50% Ni-NTA slurry (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to 4 ml of clear lysate and rocked for 60 min at 4 °C.The Ni-NTA slurry-protein mixture was poured into a column and washed three times with 25 ml of phosphate wash buffer (20 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0). Purified His-Fur was eluted with phosphate elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0). The His tag was cleaved by adding 3 units of thrombin (Novagen, Madison, WI) per 2 mg of His-Fur and by incubating at room temperature for 2 h. To remove imidazole, Fur was further purified by retention through a 10-kDa nominal molecular size limit Ultrafree column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The His tags were removed by resuspending the retentate in 1.2 ml of 50% Ni-NTA/300 μl of purified Fur and loaded on a column. Purified Fur free of His tags was collected in appropriate column flow-through and wash fractions and diluted to 1 μm in electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay (EMSA) binding buffer (10 mm bis-Tris borate, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5).Construction of Metal-binding Site BjFur Mutants—Nucleotides in the cloned B. japonicum fur corresponding to amino acid residues implicated in structural and metal-sensing metal binding in P. aeruginosa (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Google Scholar) were systematically altered using QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to code for alanine residues to assess the role of these residues in Fur activity. To construct the site 1 mutant, amino acid residues His-97 (288-CAT-292 → 288-GCG-292), Asp-99 (294-GAC-298 → 294-GCG-298), Glu-118 (351-GAG-355 → 351-GCG-355), and His-135 (402-CAC-406 → 402-GCG-406) were altered to code for alanine residues. To construct the site 2 (putative Zn2+-binding) mutant residues His-43 (126-CAT-130 → 126-GCG-130), Glu-91 (270-GAG-274 → 270-GCG-274), His-100 (297-CAC-301 → 297-GCG-301), and Glu-111 (330-GAG-334 → 330-GCG-334) were altered to produce alanine residues. A double mutant was constructed containing alanine substitutions for His-43, His-97, Asp-99, His-100, Glu-111, Glu-118, and His-135. The altered fur genes, respectively named BjFurS1, BjFurS2, and BjFurS1S2 were ligated into pET14b and expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(plysS) cells as described above.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSAs were used to determine Fur binding to DNA. Using a protocol modified from de Lorenzo et al. (20de Lorenzo V. Giovannini F. Herrero M. Neilands J.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 875-884Google Scholar), Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a 20-μl volume of EMSA binding buffer supplemented with 50 ng of herring sperm DNA, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2 and 1 nm radiolabeled DNA probe. Double-stranded DNA probes were produced by boiling and slowly cooling synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) in annealing buffer (150 mm NaCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and filled in with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI). Following incubation, EMSA reactions were analyzed on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in electrophoresis buffer (20 mm bis-Tris borate, pH 7.5) that were prerun for 30 min at 200-V constant voltage. After electrophoresis at 4 °C for 45 to 90 min at 200 V, gels were dried and autoradiographed. The Fur box probe was isolated as an 83-bp fragment from a NotI and XhoI digestion of pSKIron. A BanII and HpaI digest of pSKSBIrr was used to isolate a 63-bp fragment containing the irr promoter. Autoradiograms were developed on BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.), scanned using a GS-700 densitometer (Bio-Rad), and signal intensities were detected and quantified using Quantity One (Bio-Rad). To determine the dissociation binding constant (Kd), binding reactions were titrated with various concentrations of Fur. Bound and unbound DNA were quantified by comparing relative signal intensities. Signal intensities were imported into Excel spreadsheets and analyzed using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Sofware Inc., San Diego, CA).DNase I Footprint Analysis—DNase I footprint analysis examined the DNA region protected by Fur binding. 15 nm Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in a 50-μl volume containing EMSA binding buffer, 125 ng of herring sperm DNA, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 100 μm MnCl2 or 100 μm freshly prepared FeSO4, and 1 nmirr promoter probe end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with Klenow. 50 μl of room temperature solution of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm MgCl2 was added and after 1 min was followed by the addition of 0.45 unit of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) in 18 μl of 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The reaction was incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml yeast RNA), and DNA was extracted with phenol: choloroform (1:1) followed by ethanol precipitation. G + A ladders of the labeled DNA were produced as described (21Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Google Scholar). Digested probe products were separated on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis buffer. Autoradiograms were developed on BioMax film. The DNA probe used for DNase I footprint analysis was 3′-end-labeled; therefore the top of the gel represents the 5′-end.In Vitro Transcription Assays—To directly examine the influence of B. japonicum Fur on transcription from the irr promoter, in vitro transcription assays were performed on irr promoter DNA. irr promoter fragments were generated by PCR amplification of an irr sequence in pSKSBIrr using the primers 5′-TTTGAATTCGTGACCAAAATCGGCTAAG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGCAGGGACGTCGTCGTCGTGAT-3′, producing a 272-bp DNA fragment that terminated 80 base pairs downstream of the irr transcription start site determined previously (16Hamza I. Qi Z. King N.D. O'Brian M.R. Microbiology (Read.). 2000; 146: 669-676Google Scholar). Fur was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in EMSA buffer without glycerol, 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, 20 mm MgCl2, 10mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 4 nmirr promoter template DNA, and either no added metal, 100 μm MnCl2, or 100 μm freshly prepared FeSO4. The final volume was 10 μl. The samples were flushed with N2 to remove air. 0.5 unit of RNA polymerase (Epicenter, Madison, WI) was added, reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, after which 10 μl of a preheated NTP mixture (100 μm metal where appropriate, 250 μm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 20 μm UTP, 8 μm [γ-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol in 10 μl of H2O)) was added, and reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C. Transcription products were run on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA electrophoresis buffer alongside a Low Range RNA ladder (Fermentas Inc., Hanover, MA) labeled with ATP [α-32P]ATP with polynucleotide kinase (Promega, Madison, WI).Atomic Absorption—B. japonicum and E. coli Fur proteins were purified as described above and were analyzed directly or reconstituted using a procedure modified from Althaus et al. (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar). 70–100 μm Fur protein was incubated with a 4-fold excess of ZnCl2 and a 10-fold excess of dithiothreitol in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) for 4 h at 4 °C. Unbound metal was removed by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (Roche Applied Science). Flameless atomic absorption analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer model 1100B spectrophotometer equipped with a model 700 graphite furnace and an AS-70 autosampler. Fur protein concentrations were determined in Bradford assays using bovine serum albumin standards, adjusted for a 120% overestimation as described previously (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar).RESULTSMetal Increases the Affinity of B. japonicum Fur for DNA— Fur proteins mediate iron-dependent control of gene expression in vivo and bind metals in vitro. Thus, we wanted to determine the effects of metal on B. japonicum Fur (BjFur) binding to a cognate Fur-binding site. The irr gene from B. japonicum is transcriptionally regulated by BjFur and binds to an element within the irr promoter containing three imperfect direct repeat hexamers (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar). The binding of recombinant BjFur to DNA corresponding to the BjFur binding site on the irr promoter was measured in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using Mn2+ as a surrogate metal. Titration of DNA with an increasing concentration of BjFur in the presence of Mn2+ revealed two complexes in EMSA, a high mobility complex (HMC) at lower protein concentrations and a low mobility complex (LMC) at higher concentrations (Fig. 1A). Previous work shows that the HMC and the LMC correspond to a Fur dimer and to two dimers or a tetramer, respectively (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar). In the absence of Mn2+, Fur bound DNA much less well than in the presence of metal at each protein concentration tested (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, only the HMC was detected at 50 nm BjFur in the absence of Mn2+, whereas the LMC was predominant in the presence of Mn2+ at that protein concentration.The effects of Mn2+ on the binding affinity of BjFur for the cognate DNA element were estimated from EMSA data by plotting bound DNA as a function of protein concentration (Fig. 1C). The Kd value of BjFur for DNA was 2.2 nm in the presence of Mn2+, which is in good agreement with what we reported previously (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar). In the absence of metal, the binding affinity was nearly 30-fold lower, with a Kd of 60 nm. These observations show that Mn2+ substantially increases the affinity of BjFur for DNA.BjFur Binds DNA in an Iron-responsive Manner in Vitro— We and others routinely use Mn2+ or another divalent metal as a presumed surrogate for Fe2+ for in vitro analysis of Fur (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar, 23Escolar L. Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 537-547Google Scholar). However, the discovery that Fur is a zinc metalloprotein in at least some organisms calls into question the role of these other metals, and one report questions whether a regulatory Fe2+ is required for activity (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar). EMSA analysis using Fe2+ is problematic because the DNA-protein complex must remain intact throughout the electrophoresis where ferrous iron can oxidize to the ferric form. Therefore, we assessed the dependence of Fe2+ on DNA binding activity by DNase I footprinting analysis, maintaining anaerobic conditions in the binding and digestion reactions (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Metal-dependent protection of the irr promoter by wild type and Fur proteins in DNase I footprinting analysis. Protection of DNA from DNase I digestion by bound Fur was carried out as described under “Materials and Methods.” The DNA was radiolabeled at the 3′-end; thus the 5′-end of the non-template strand of DNA (with respect to the irr gene) is at the top of the gel. Bars on the left indicate protection regions consistent with formation of high (HMC) and low mobility (LMC) complexes. 15 nm wild type BjFur, site 1 mutant BjFurS1, site 2 mutant BjFurS2, and site 1 and 2 mutant BjFurS1S2 proteins were used in the absence of metal (–) or presence of 100 μm MnCl2 (Mn) or FeSO4 (Fe). Digestions in the absence of Fur are marked NP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The irr promoter region was slightly protected by BjFur in the absence of metal compared with the control containing no protein (Fig. 2, first panel). However, in the presence of Fe2+, wild type BjFur bound the irr promoter and protected a region that includes the three imperfect direct repeat hexamers described previously (7Friedman Y.E. O'Brian M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38395-38401Google Scholar). The protection was similar to that observed for Mn2+, indicating that Mn2+ was qualitatively similar to Fe2+ with respect to the effect on BjFur. Thus, BjFur is an iron-responsive DNA-binding protein.Effects of Mutations in Putative Metal-binding Sites of Fur on DNA Binding in EMSA—The structure of Fur from P. aeruginosa crystallized in the presence of Zn2+ revealed two metal-binding sites (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Google Scholar). Each metal coordinates with amino acids that are conserved in many Fur homologs, including B. japonicum (Fig. 3), leading Pohl et al. (11Pohl E. Haller J.C. Mijovilovich A. Meyer-Klaucke W. Garman E. Vasil M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 903-915Google Scholar) to extrapolate their findings for P. aeruginosa to Fur proteins from other organisms. Site 1 is proposed to be the regulatory Fe2+-binding site and is composed of amino acids corresponding to His-97, Asp-99, Glu-118, and His-135 in B. japonicum (Fig. 3). The mutant BjFurS1 lacking site 1 was constructed by changing these residues to alanine. Surprisingly, this mutant bound DNA in a metal-responsive manner similar to the wild type EMSA analysis (Fig. 4, also see below). Titration of DNA with BjFurS1 in the presence of Mn2+ showed a concentration-dependent formation of a HMC and an LMC similar to the wild type, and both proteins had similar Kd values of 2.2 and 4.5 nm for the wild type and the mutant, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). These data indicate that conserved amino acids attributed to metal site 1 are not required for metal-dependent DNA binding activity.Fig. 3Alignment of Fur proteins from E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and B. japonicum. The closed circles and open triangles, respectively, refer to residues that comprise the putative regulatory Fe2+-binding site (site 1) and the structural Zn2+-binding site (site 2) derived from crystallographic and spectroscopic analysis of P. aeruginosa Fur and conserved in many Fur proteins, including those from E. coli and B. japonicum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4EMSA analysis of BjFur mutants binding to irr promoter DNA.A, EMSA analysis was carried out essentially as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Either 0, 5, or 50 nm protein was used. The Fur proteins used were wild type BjFur, BjFurS1 altered in site 1 amino acids, BjFurS2 altered in site 2 amino acids, or BjFurS1S2 altered in both sites. B, EMSA gels using protein concentrations from 0 to 100 nm were visualized by autoradiography, quantified, and plotted as bound DNA versus protein concentration for wild type (squares), BjFurS1 (diamonds), BjFurS2 (circles), and BjFurS1S2 (triangles).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Site 2 is proposed to bind a structural zinc ligand and is composed of amino acids corresponding to His-43, Glu-91, His-100, and Glu-111 in B. japonicum Fur (Fig. 3). We constructed a BjFur mutant in which each of these residues was substituted with alanine. This mutant, BjFurS2, bound irr promoter DNA with a Kd value of 1.8 nm, similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 4). Thus, the residues implicated in metal site 2 are not necessary for the DNA binding activity of BjFur. This observation led us to ask whether zinc is associated with purified recombinant BjFur as has been reported for E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Using atomic absorption spectrometry, we found that purified recombinant E. coli Fur contained 0.9 mol of zinc per mol of E. coli Fur in good agreement with a previous report (8Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6555-6569Google Scholar). However, we could only detect zinc in BjFur preparations at less than 0.1 mol/mol of monomer, and thus we cannot conclude that BjFur contains a tightly bound zinc essential for function.Although BjFurS2 bound DNA with high affinity, it formed only a high mobility complex on EMSA (Fig. 4A) even with 50 nm protein, whereas the wild type protein formed a low mobility complex. Thus, one or more of the amino acids mutated in BjFurS2 is necessary for two BjFur dimers to occupy the irr promoter. We have no explanation for this observation, but the metal-responsive, high affinity binding of this mutant is not consistent with a disruption in a portion of the protein necessary to maintain the structural integrity of the monomer.We also constructed BjFurS1S2, a mutant in which amino acids corresponding to both sites 1 and 2 were changed to alanine. This mutant did not bind DNA in EMSA analysis, even up to 100 nm DNA (Fig. 4, A and B). Wild type BjFur binds DNA in the absence of metal but with lower affinity (Fig. 1). Thus, BjFurS1S2 does not behave as an unmetalated Fur protein but rather as an inactive one. Although no structural analysis of BjFurS1S2 was carried out, it is likely that the extensive mutagenesis compromised the structural integrity of the protein.The irr promoter element to which BjFur binds is dissimilar to"

(EC 1.11.1.9) is a selenoenzyme that protects the biomembrane and other cellular components against oxidative damage (1Christophersen B.O. Biochim. Biophys.

Mills discovered its activity in 1957 (4Mills G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 229: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the stoichiometric amount of selenium was found in this enzyme in 1973 (5Rotruck J.T. Pope A.L. Ganther H.E. Swanson A.B. Hafeman D.G. Science. 1973; 179: 588-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar, 6Flohe L. Gunzler W.A. Schock H.H. FEBS Lett. 1973; 32: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). As shown in Reaction 1, ROOH+2GSH→Glutathione peroxidaseROH+H2O+GSSGReaction 1 the enzyme catalyzes the reduction of a variety of hydroperoxides by using glutathione as the reducing substrate (7Cotgreave I.A. Moldeus P. Brattsand R. Hallberg A. Andersson C.M. Engman L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ROOH is a hydroperoxide such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH), tert-butyl hydroperoxide, etc. GSSG is the oxidized form of GSH, which is reverted to GSH by glutathione reductase, and ROH is the corresponding alcohol or H2O when the substrate is H2O2. GPX is distributed extensively in cell, blood, and tissues, and its activity decreases when an organism suffers from diseases such as diabetes (8Davis R.L. Lavine C.L. Arredondo M.A. McMahon P. Tenner Jr., T.E. Int. J. Exp. Diabetes Res. 2002; 3: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), Keshan disease (9Burke M.P. Opeskin K. Med. Sci.

Acta. 1996; 1315: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and other maladies; therefore, GPX is involved in many pathological conditions and is one of the most important antioxidant enzymes in living organisms. However, the therapeutic usage of the native GPX is limited because of its instability, its limited availability, and the fact that is extremely difficult to prepare by using genetic engineering techniques because it contains selenocysteine encoded by the stop codon UGA. Thus, many artificial mimics of GPX have been made, but most of them have low GPX activity because they lack a substrate binding site. Among these mimics, the selenoorganic compound ebselen (2-phenyl-1, 2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one) was first used for hydroperoxide-inactivating therapy. Ebselen has properties such as free radical and singlet oxygen quenching. It can protect against oxidative challenge in vitro in liposomes, microsomes, isolated cells, and organs (12Sies H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated to have a potent inhibitory effect on inflammation in several animal models (13Hoshida S. Kuzuya T. Nishida M. Yamashita N. Hori M. Kamada T. Tada M. Am. J.

Saito I. Shinohara Y. Asano T. Yasuhara H. Stroke. 1998; 29: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). As a result, ebselen is currently approved in Japan to treat stroke patients despite its limitations, such as poor water solubility and low activity (0.99 units/μmol) as compared with native GPX. Most of the existing GPX mimics have low GPX activities because they lack a substrate binding site. To make GPX mimics with higher activity and better specificity, we have synthesized a series of GPX mimics with a GSH binding site since the end of 1980s (17Liu J.Q. Shi C.B. Luo G.M. Liu Z.

They all display rather high activities and good water solubility compared with ebselen. Nevertheless, some of them have large molecular sizes (>31 kDa), which hampered their pharmacological potentials. Here we describe a low molecular weight novel GPX mimic with much greater catalytic activity than ebselen. We identified a series of GSH-binding peptides by affinity selection from phage-displayed random 15-mer peptide libraries against GSH, one of the substrates of GPX. We enable the peptide to possess GPX enzymatic activity by introducing the catalytic group, selenocysteine, into the peptides using chemical mutation. In addition, considering the nature of the double substrate reaction, we altered the peptide sequence to optimize its binding affinity for the second substrate, ROOH or H2O2. The resulting GPX mimic shows superior kinetics and antioxidant ability. Materials—The phage strains K91 and K91Kan bearing random 15-mer peptides libraries were gifts from Professor George P. Smith from the Division of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri. GSH-agarose resin, reduced glutathione, NADPH, and glutathione reductase were products of Sigma. Culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen and Hyclone (Logan, UT), respectively. All chemicals were of analytical or reagent grade. Scanning of a 15-Mer Phage Display Peptide Library and Analysis by Phage Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The phage library of random 15-mer peptides was incubated with GSH-agarose resin overnight at 4 °C. Specifically bound phage was eluted by Buffer A (150 mm sodium chloride and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) and obtained by centrifugation at 7000 × g. The recovered phage was amplified in K91or K91Kan, and the phage titer was expressed in plague-forming units. Three rounds of selection were performed, after which individual plaque was picked up randomly and subjected to analysis by phage ELISA and DNA sequencing following the preparation of single strand DNA. ELISA was performed as follows. GSH was immobilized on 96-well plates and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin. Phage of 5 × 1012 plaque-forming units/ml were added to the plates and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then washed six times with buffer A containing 0.1% Tween 20, and bound phage was detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody. The A405 nm value was measured after 20 min of incubation using a microplate reader. Synthesis and Characterization of the Selenopeptide—The 15-mer peptide was synthesized by the Meilian Corporation (Xian, China). The purity of the peptide was >98%. The selenation of the 15-mer peptide was performed according to Ref. 26Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 5647-5648Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar. Sodium hydroselenide was prepared according to the method described (27Klayman D.L. Griffin T.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 197-199Crossref Scopus (604) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of the 15-mer peptide was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 10 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride solution (20 mg/ml acetonitrile) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The sulfonylated 15-mer peptide was flushed using pure nitrogen for 20 min and then treated with 20 μl of 1 m sodium hydroselenide for 40 h at 37 °C. The crude reaction mixture was first purified by centrifugation, dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) using a dialyzer (molecular mass cutoff, 3 kDa) for 24 h with a change of buffer every 2 h, and finally freeze-dried to obtain the product of the mimic. The binding constant for GSH was assessed by quenching the fluorescence of the mimic or the 15-mer peptide with GSH as described (28Jolley M.E. Glaudemans C.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 33: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Samples were adjusted to an A280 nm of <0.05 in a final volume of 2 ml with buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The measurements were performed in an RF-5301PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimazu) using λex = 295 nm and λem = 345 nm. Samples were quenched with GSH with gradually increased concentrations. The selenium content of the mimic was measured using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (29Bell I.M. Fisher M.L. Wu Z.P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3754-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The mimic was treated with excess sodium borohydride in phosphate-buffered saline buffer under nitrogen gas for 30 min, the solution was treated with 1 m imidazole to quench the excessive reducing agent and adjusted to pH 7 with 1 m HCl, and 100 μl of the mimic was added to 5 ml of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) solution (0.1 mm). The concentration of selenol in the mimic was determined from the absorption of 3-carboxy-4-nitrobenzenethiolate at 410 nm (ϵ = 11,400 m–1 cm–1; pH 7). Determination of GPX-like Activity and Kinetics—The catalytic activity was determined by the method of Wilson et al. (30Wilson S.R. Zucker P.A. Huang R.R.C. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5936-5939Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out at 37 °C in 700 μl of solution containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium azide, 1 mm GSH, 0.25 mm NADPH, 1 unit of glutathione reductase, and 10–50 μm of the mimic. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.5 mm H2O2 or CuOOH. The activity was determined by the decrease of NADPH absorption at 340 nm. Background absorption was run without mimic and was subtracted. The activity unit is defined as the amount of the mimic, which utilizes 1 μmol of NADPH per min. The activity is expressed in units/μmol of enzyme mimic. The assay of kinetics of the mimic was similar to that of native GPX (31Flohe L. Loschen G. Cunzler W.A. Eichele E. Hoppe-Seyler'sZ. Physiol. Chem. 1972; 353: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The initial rates were measured by observing the change of NADPH absorption at 340 nm at several concentrations of one substrate while the concentration of the other substrate was kept constant. All kinetic experiments were performed in 700 μl of the reaction solution containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 1 mm EDTA, 1 unit of glutathione reductase, 0.25 mm NADPH, and the appropriate concentrations of GSH, H2O2, and mimic. The mimic was pre-incubated with GSH, NADPH, and glutathione reductase. The reaction was initiated by the addition of appropriate concentrations of H2O2. The non-catalytic reaction affecting the measurement of the initial rate was taken into account and subtracted to obtain exact kinetic values. Kinetic data were analyzed by double reciprocal plotting. Culture of Epidermal Cells and Evaluation of Antioxidative Effect— Epidermal cells were cultured as described in references (32Sun Y. Mu Y.

Synthesis and Characterization of the Selenopeptide—To find a peptide that can mimic the GPX activity, we first screened a 15-mer phage display peptide library using one of the GPX substrates, GSH. The phages with high affinities for GSH were selected according to the result of ELISA (A405 nm > 1.60). The sequences for the peptides of these phages were determined by DNA sequencing. The amino acid sequences of these peptides are listed in Table I.Table ISequences of the peptides screened out from phage-displayed peptide library against GSHNo.Peptide sequences15P1GPPPRHNVYGRPRAS15P2SLGLRASWGSGSARV15P3SNPGLFVSGYWRLFP15P4ISSASWGVAVSLLPG15P5MSFPHAHLWTSTPGF15P6LVLTFSFSPTRHSVY15P7SRGACTSPAGQLSGM15P8CVGLTSPAGSSLGYN15P9TYCSPSIFKCVALAQ15P10SACSLFNFWLVVVIY15P11SLFQYGLWVATSPLL15P12PRRPYKWMPYPILQY Open table in a new tab Sequence analysis revealed that the 12 peptides were rich in hydrophobic amino acid and had no negatively charged amino acids. No clear conservative motif was identified. Furthermore, alignment of the individual peptide sequence with the sequence of native GPX for GSH binding did not show any homology, although it remains possible that one or more of the peptides might be a structure mimic of a discontinuous or conformational epitope with the binding site for GSH. Among these peptides, 15P1 had the strongest ability to bind GSH and, thus, was chosen for synthesis and chemical modification to imitate GPX. The synthetic route of selenopeptide is shown in Scheme 1. The selenohydryl group was introduced into the peptide by selective sulfonylation of the serine hydroxyl of the 15-mer peptide. The nucleophilic substitution by sodium hydroselenide gave selenopeptide 1, which was oxidized in air to form selenopeptide 2, named 15SeP1. The resulting compound, 15SeP1, contains a diselenium bridge (-Se-Se-) and two fragments of 15-mer peptides. To confirm this result, the selenium content of 15SeP1 was measured by the 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) method and found to be 1.97 ± 0.30 mol of selenium per mole of molecule. This indicates that 1 mol of molecule contains 2 mol of selenium. The introduction of SeH into 15P1 decreased the ability of 15P1 to bind GSH, as the association constant for the GSH of 15P1 was 7.974E+05, 10 times higher than that of 15SeP1 (7.263E+04) (See Table II).Table IIAssociation constants of GPX mimics for GSHGPX mimicsGSH association constantm-115SeP17.263E+0415P17.974E+0515SeP3.151E+0415P3.478E+05Se-scFv2F3 (24Su D.

Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity versus the concentration of substrates gave a family of parallel lines (Fig. 1), a result consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. This result demonstrated that the GPX mimic, 15SeP1, has the same catalytic mechanism as that of native GPX. The apparent kinetic parameters were calculated from the double-reciprocal plots and listed in Table IV.

Upon comparing the apparent second-order rate constants kcat/KmGSH and kcat/KmH2O of native GPX with those of 15SeP1 (Table IV), we found that 2there are no obvious differences in kcat/KmGSH values between GPX and 15SeP1, which indicate that the two have similar affinities to GSH. However, a significant difference exists in kcat/KmH2O2 values between native GPX and 15SeP1, indicating that the native GPX has more specific binding for the second substrate, H2O2, than does 15SeP1). Because the GPX enzyme catalyzes a double substrate reaction, it is more reasonable to consider the binding for both substrates in the peptide GPX mimic. According to the active site structure of the native GPX, we proposed that the GPX mimic should include a hydrophobic environment, which is essential for the GSH and H2O2 (ROOH) binding, and that the GPX activity may therefore be enhanced upon increasing the binding affinity for the substrate, H2O2/ROOH. In doing this, the sequence of first four amino acids from the N terminus of 15P1, Gly, Pro, Pro, and Pro, was changed to the sequence of Trp, Pro, Phe, and Leu. There are several reasons for this alteration, as follows: (i) these amino acids are highly hydrophobic; (ii) they appeared at a relatively high rate of frequency in the active central structure of native GPX (Fig. 2); (iii) the sequence of the four modified amino acids can form a structure that shares the most similarity with the active central structure of native GPX (Fig. 2) through computer modeling with Insight II modeling software (Fig. 3); and (iv) these amino acids appeared at a relatively high rate of frequency in the sequences of 15-mer peptides screened out from the phage library (Table I). The altered peptide sequence, WPFLRHNVYGRPRAS, is named 15P.Fig. 3The structure of 15P by molecular modeling. Insight II protein modeling software (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used for creating the three-dimensional structure of 15P. Amino acid number s1, 2, 3, and 4 were the hydrophobic amino acids Trp, Pro, Phe, Leu, which formed the hydrophobic microenvironment. The number 15 amino acid was Ser, which was later modified to become the catalytic center, selenocysteine. Both the number 5 and the number 13 amino acids were Arg, which can form salt bridge with carboxyl group of GSH. The number 10 amino acid was Gly, which made the peptide easy to fold.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The preparation of the selenopeptide 15SeP was same as that of 15SeP1 in Scheme 1. The GPX catalytic efficiency of 15SeP was measured (Table III). We compared the GPX activities and kinetics of 15SeP with those of 15SeP1 (Tables III and IV). The activity of 15SeP that catalyzed the reduction of H2O2 by GSH (260 units/μmol) is much higher than that of 15SeP1 (190 units/μmol). More significantly, the activity of 15SeP was increased much more compared with that of 15SeP1 when the substrate H2O2 was changed to CuOOH; the activity of 15SeP for the reduction of CuOOH by GSH (1176 units/μmol) is 4.5 times that of 15SeP for the reduction of H2O2 by GSH (260 units/μmol), whereas the activity of 15SeP1 for the reduction of CuOOH by GSH (570 units/μmol) was only three times of that of 15SeP1 for the reduction of H2O2 by GSH (190 units/μmol). The association constant for 15SeP to GSH (3.151E+04) was not greatly lower than that of 15SeP1 (7.263E+04) (Table II). This finding is consistent with the result that the association constant for 15P to GSH, 3.478E+05, was close to that of 15P1, 7.974E+05. There was no obvious difference between 15SeP and 15SeP1 when kcat/KmGSH was compared. These results show that 15SeP and 15SeP1 have similar substrate binding abilities toward GSH. There is a 10-fold difference in the kcat/KmH2O2 between 15SeP and 15SeP1 (Table IV), indicating that 15SeP has more specific binding for H2O2 than does 15SeP1. Thus, the selenopeptide 15SeP had very strong ability to bind not only to the substrate GSH but also to the substrate H2O2. Furthermore, the affinity of 15SeP for H2O2 was the highest among the existing GPX mimics and is close to that of native GPX. These data showed that the 15SeP obtained from the phage display peptide library had very high specificity for binding the first substrate, GSH, and was superior to Se-Fv (22Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z.Q. Luo G.M. Zhao D.Q. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and the imprinting enzyme (23Liu J.Q. Luo G.M. Gao S.J. Zhang K. Chen X.F. Shen J.C. Chem. Commun. 1999; 2: 199-200Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, 15SeP has a stronger activity to bind the hydrophobic hydroperoxide CuOOH. Its kcat/KmC-uOOH (7.55E+09 m–1 min–1) is significantly higher than that of 15SeP1 (4.03E+08 m–1 min–1), indicating that 15SeP had a much stronger hydrophobic microenvironment for catalysis than does 15SeP1, and, therefore, substrates with a strong hydrophobic property were suitable substrates for 15SeP. The results for activity and kinetics measurements are consistent with our earlier hypothesis that 15SeP, with more hydrophobic microenvironment, should be easier for substrate ROOH binding than 15SeP1, which led to higher GPX activity. Antioxidant Ability of the GPX Mimic Selenopeptide—The antioxidant effect of 15SeP is shown in Fig. 4. The culture of epidermal cells was treated with 1 mm H2O2, followed by treatment with or without protective agents. The MDA contents were measured to reflect the lipid peroxidation (32Sun Y. Mu Y. Li W.J. Lv S.W. Jiang Z.H. Zhang K. Zheng K.Y. Lin F. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Liu J.Q. Shen J.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 412: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 35Romero F.J. Bosch-Morell F. Romero M.J. Jareno E.J. Romero B. Marin N. Roma J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 1229-1234PubMed Google Scholar), LDH activity was assayed to assess the cell leakage as a result of the peroxidation (36Lahiri D.K. Farlow M.R. Nurnberger Jr., J.I. Greig N.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 826: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and cell viability was also measured to evaluate the oxidative damage. MDA content, LDH leakage, and the decrease of the cell viability induced by H2O2 were measured and set as the standard for comparison (Fig. 4; *, p > 0.05). 15SeP significantly reduced the level of MDA, lowered the LDH activity, and increased the viability of cells (Fig. 4; *, p > 0.05). The increase of the MDA content and LDH leakage induced by H2O2 were also inhibited by ebselen at the same molar amount of 15SeP, but they were obviously higher than that of 15SeP group (Fig. 4; #, p < 0.05), and the cell viability was lower than that of 15SeP group (Fig. 4; #, p < 0.05). This indicates the antioxidant ability of 15SeP is superior to that of ebselen. At the same time, we also compared the antioxidant ability of 15SeP with that of another GPX mimic, 6-diSeCD. The GPX activity of 15SeP (260 units/μmol) is 19.3-fold higher than 6-diSeCD (13.5 units/μmol; see Table III). We found that the efficacy of 6-diSeCD to antioxidize in reducing MDA content and LDH activity and increasing cell viability was between that of 15SeP and ebselen, indicating that the antioxidant ability of 15SeP is also superior to that of 6-diSeCD. Taken together, the GPX activity is critical for a GPX mimic in clinical application. Although native GPX has high activity, it has many drawbacks for clinical application, such as poor stability, immunogenicity, and bigger molecular mass (∼80 kDa), which limited its cellular accessibility. The activity of 15SeP is 22.2-fold lower than that of native GPX, but the former does not have the drawbacks of the latter. This finding gives 15SeP great pharmaceutical potential. In addition, as is also shown in Fig. 4, 1 μm 15SeP did not affect the viability of epidermal cells, indicating that 15SeP itself has very low toxicity to the cells. More importantly, we found that the 15SeP can penetrate into cell membrane and increase the GPX activity in the cells (Fig. 5). As shown in Fig. 5, the GPX activity in epidermal cells, to which 1 unit/ml 15SeP was administered for 1 h, was only 0.26 units/ml, indicating that only 26% of 15SeP entered into the epidermal cells. The GPX activity in the cells was increased with time, indicating that more and more 15SeP molecules penetrate the cell membrane to enter the cells, and ∼84% of 15SeP penetrated into epidermal cells within 10 h. Compared with the existing mimics, our new GPX mimic has rather high activity and specificity. It displayed strong antioxidant effect, low toxicity, better water solubility, and small size. These advantages indicate that 15SeP could be a more effective antioxidant in clinical application.Fig. 5The GPX activity change in epidermal cells and cell culture medium. Epidermal cells were treated as indicated and divided into two groups, namely the normal cell group and test group to which 1 unit/ml of 15SeP was administrated. GPX activities in epidermal cells and cell culture medium were determined respectively (one time every hour) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. of six separate experiments. The GPX activities in the normal cells were substrated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because of the lack of GSH binding site, early GPX mimics usually have rather low activities. Take, for example, the well known GPX mimic ebselen; its activity is only 0.99 units/μmol. Wilson et al. (30Wilson S.R. Zucker P.A. Huang R.R.C. Spector A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 5936-5939Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar) introduced a quaternary ammonium salt close to the diselenide bridge of a GPX mimic to improve its ability to bind GSH by electrostatic attraction to GPX. As a result, the activity of diphenyl diselenide compound can be increased up to 11 units/μmol. Therefore, the key to imitation GPX is to generate affinity for GSH. Based on this idea, we have developed several selenium-containing catalytic antibodies such as Se-Fv (22Ding L. Liu Z. Zhu Z.Q. Luo G.M. Zhao D.Q. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Se-scFv (20Ren X.J. Gao S.J. You D.L. Huang H.L. Liu Z. Mu Y. Liu J.Q. Zhang Y. Yan G.L. Luo G.M. Yang T.S. Shen J.C. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 369-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They had high catalytic activities, but their molecular sizes were large. To reduce the molecular size of the GPX mimic by taking advantage of the phage display technology, we created a new mimic, 15SeP, with the specific binding to the first substrate, GSH, and also created the favored microenvironment for the second substrate, H2O2, aided by rational design. Data showed that the helpful microenvironment for the second substrate was equally important in order to generate a high activity of mimic. Our results indicate that recognition sites for two substrates should be considered at the same time for imitating the enzyme that catalyzes a double substrate reaction. We are grateful to Dr. Xuexun Fang for the creative critiques and editing help in preparing this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2086427371,"Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are among the largest groups of enzymes found and are usually classified on the basis of sequence comparisons into many families of varying similarity (CAZy systematics). Only two different Rossman-like folds have been detected (GT-A and GT-B) within the small number of established crystal structures. A third uncharacterized fold has been indicated with transmembrane organization (GT-C). We here use a method based on multivariate data analyses (MVDAs) of property patterns in amino acid sequences and can with high accuracy recognize the correct fold in a large data set of GTs. Likewise, a retaining or inverting enzymatic mechanism for attachment of the donor sugar could be properly revealed in the GT-A and GT-B fold group sequences by such analyses. Sequence alignments could be correlated to important variables in MVDA, and the separating amino acid positions could be mapped over the active sites. These seem to be localized to similar positions in space for the α/β/α binding motifs in the GT-B fold group structures. Analogous, active-site sequence positions were found for the GT-A fold group. Multivariate property patterns could also easily group most GTs annotated in the genomes of Escherichia coli and Synechocystis to proper fold or organization group, according to benchmarking comparisons at the MetaServer. We conclude that the sequence property patterns revealed by the multivariate analyses seem more conserved than amino acid types for these GT groups, and these patterns are also conserved in the structures. Such patterns may also potentially define substrate preferences.

Glycosyltransferases (GTs) 1The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; CAZy, carbohydrate active enzymes; SGC, SpsA GnT I core; TM, transmembrane; ORF, open reading frame; ACC, autocross-covariance; PLSDA, partial least squares projections to latent structures discriminant analysis.1The abbreviations used are: GT, glycosyltransferase; CAZy, carbohydrate active enzymes; SGC, SpsA GnT I core; TM, transmembrane; ORF, open reading frame; ACC, autocross-covariance; PLSDA, partial least squares projections to latent structures discriminant analysis. are one of the largest and most diverse enzyme groups in all living cells. This enzyme group performs many critical functions such as the synthesis of glycogen and carbohydrate-polymers, they act on proteins that mediate cell-cell interactions and glycosylate transcription regulators (1Boix E. Swaminathan G.J. Zhang Y. Natesh R. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48608-48614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Hence, the variety of acceptors that GTs act on is highly diverse, with saccharides, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid being the most common. To reflect the structural variation of the acceptors and donators that glycosyltransferases can use, and the fact that the sequence similarity within the glycosyltransferases is low, a large diversity of folds of these enzymes has been expected (2Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Glycosylhydrolases, enzymes performing the reverse reaction, have been found to have many different fold types (2Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), but so far only two different folds have been discovered within the solved crystal structures for the GTs, named GT-A and GT-B, respectively (3Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A third glycosyltransferase group (GT-C) has been discovered by iterative BLAST searches and by structural comparisons (4Liu J. Mushegian A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 1418-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). These proteins are integral membrane proteins with the active site in the long loop, and with the transmembrane helix number varying between 8 and 13. The GT-C family can also be found with Hidden Markov method searches within the GT families. This method has also identified a fourth family, unique for eukaryotes, named GT-D (5Kikuchi N. Kwon Y.D. Gotoh M. Narimatsu H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The GT-A fold consists of two tightly associated β/α/β domains, of varying sizes, with separated nucleotide (SGC) and acceptor binding domains (6Unligil U.M. Rini J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 510-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The majority of the proteins in this fold group have a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain followed by a transmembrane (TM) segment, a stem region to reach out from the membrane, and finally the large globular enzyme part (3Breton C. Imberty A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The GT-B group has two similar, but less tightly associated Rossman-like β/α/β fold domains and are frequently membrane-associated (7Breton C. Mucha J. Jeanneau C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, only a very limited number of proteins from the GT-B group seem to have TM segments. The GT-A group presently consists of nine solved crystal structures from sequence families GT-2, GT-6, GT-7, GT-8, GT-13, and GT-43, and the GT-B group of seven structures from GT-1, GT-4, GT-20, GT-28, GT-35, GT-63, and GT-64, respectively, in the CAZy systematics sequence data base (available at afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html). Reaction mechanisms of both retaining and inverting types are included in both A and B fold groups (denoted clans). Within the GT-A fold family with the retaining mechanism, the stereochemistry of the C1 position of the donor sugar substrate is conserved and well studied (2Bourne Y. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 8Unligil U.M. Zhou S. Yuwaraj S. Sarkar M. Schachter H. Rini J.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5269-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The retaining mechanism is poorly understood and may consist of a few steps involving stable intermediates. Hence, there is no coupling between reaction mechanism and fold. Most comparative studies of glycosyltransferases have been based on amino acid sequence comparisons using BLAST and similar methods, which mainly will account for amino acid similarities and identities at specific positions. In the CAZy data base, glycosyltransferases have been divided into about 70 families based on such sequence similarities (9Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), over a comparatively short stretch of the protein. To be classified within the same family an E value of less then -3 over at least 100 amino acids is needed (9Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The data base consists of both predicted ORFs and fully functionally determined proteins. GTs within the same sequence family can have highly diverse substrate specificities, e.g. like members of family 2, but still share substantial sequence similarities (10Henrissat B. Davies G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The opposite has also been recorded: enzymes having very low sequence similarity can utilize the same substrates (7Breton C. Mucha J. Jeanneau C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and have the same fold (11Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). There is often a low sequence similarity between different families, and the fold within a family is expected to be conserved for its members (9Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 11Davies G. Henrissat B. Structure. 1995; 3: 853-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 12Henrissat B. Davies G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The catalytic mechanisms are also expected to be conserved in each CAZy family (13Gebler J. Gilkes N.R. Claeyssens M. Wilson D.B. Beguin P. Wakarchuk W.W. Kilburn D.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12559-12561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in general very few amino acid positions are conserved among the GTs, and the sequence similarities for the structures within the two established fold groups are surprisingly low. Furthermore, the number of predicted glycosyltransferases (from translated gene sequences) within an organism does not reflect the size of the genome. For example Escherichia coli (K12) with a genome size of 4639 kb has 34 predicted glycosyltransferases according to CAZy, Bacillus subtilis 4215 kb has 28 GTs, Synechocystis 3573 kb has 61 GTs, and finally Mycoplasma pneumoniae of 816 kb has three predicted GTs. To predict the function of new or encoded glycosyltransferases, the ORF of interest needs to have a close sequence similarity with an enzyme of known function. Likewise, predicting the function of new enzyme groups using sequence similarity methods is almost impossible. A new approach is needed. One possible way used here to search for new GTs, would be to look for physico-chemical properties patterns along the whole sequence. Protein sequences behave in manners far from random, and the amino acid sequence is organized to reflect the structure (14Rackovsky S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8580-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hence proteins with the same (or similar) structure or function are expected to have similar property patterns in the sequence, even at low sequence similarities, and over their full lengths or only partially (e.g. for certain domains). This is very evident for proteins with repeated motifs, e.g. TIM barrels (14Rackovsky S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8580-8584Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Wold S. Sjöström M. Acta Chem. Scand. 1998; 52: 517-523Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and must be valid for others as well. Furthermore, for proteins with the same function but different folds, certain local patterns in the sequence determining the function can still be the same. GTs of a given family performing the same reaction would be expected to have similar properties. With the multivariate sequence analysis methods, based on amino acid properties, proteins with no sequence similarity can be grouped together, visualizing conserved property patterns within the proteins. The sequence is translated into values describing different amino acid properties, i.e. hydrophobicity, bulk volume, polarizability, and charge. The periodicity of properties along a sequence is calculated followed by a multivariate analysis (16Wold S. Jonsson M. Sjöström M. Sandberg M. Rännar S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 277: 239-253Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequence length variations are of less importance. This method has been used to predict location of cellular proteins in Synechocystis 2T. Rajalahti, F. Huang, M. Sjöström, Å. Wieslander, and B. Norling, manuscript in preparation.2T. Rajalahti, F. Huang, M. Sjöström, Å. Wieslander, and B. Norling, manuscript in preparation. to characterize E. coli compartment proteins (17Sjöström M. Rännar S. Wieslander Å. Chemometrics Intell. Lab. Syst. 1995; 29: 295-305Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to classify signal peptides (18Edman M. Jarhede T. Sjöström M. Wieslander A. Proteins. 1999; 35: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present study, as a first step, a reference set of glycosyltransferases from families with known structure members was compiled from enzymes classified by CAZy. The multivariate analysis method could conveniently separate the three different fold types from each other and furthermore divide the two different reaction mechanisms within the A and B structural fold groups using sequence information. The ability to predict the fold and the sugar orientation properly was also established. Furthermore, ORFs of unknown function and that share no sequence homology with known glycosyltransferases could potentially be identified with this method to be glycosyltransferases. Data Set—In this study 141 selected glycosyltransferases from 13 different CAZy families (see Supplementary Material) were used as reference sets. The data set mainly includes sequences with known function or with high sequence similarity with proteins with known function, where the probability for the same function is high. The reference sets include both prokaryotic and eukaryotic enzymes, using various substrates and acceptors. Full-length amino acid sequences were used, i.e. no signal peptide or anchor domains found especially in the GT-A group have been removed. The number of amino acids in the protein sequences varies between 229 and 994. This data set is non-redundant and contains no pair of sequences that share more than 55% identity. Multivariate Sequence Analysis—The aim of this study is to search and use periodic physical features in the proteins that separate GTs according to structure and reaction mechanism. Amino acids can be described and characterized in a number of ways. Parameters such as retention times in different chromatographic systems, electric properties, molecular mass, etc. are commonly used, as described by Wold et al. (16Wold S. Jonsson M. Sjöström M. Sandberg M. Rännar S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 277: 239-253Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To decrease the number of parameters that describes each amino acid, and at the same time keep the information in a few variables, so-called z scales were used. These z scales are derived from 29 physical-chemical experimental parameters for the amino acids with principal component analysis (19Hellberg S. Sjöström M. Skagerberg B. Wold S. J. Med. Chem. 1987; 30: 1126-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). They can approximately be translated as z1 for “hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity,” z2 for “bulk of side-chain,” and z3 for “polarizability/charge” (see Table I). To describe the periodicities in a protein, autocross-covariance in the z values, were used (ACC) (16Wold S. Jonsson M. Sjöström M. Sandberg M. Rännar S. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 277: 239-253Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The ACC program multiplies the first z value for the first amino acid with the second, followed with the first and third up to the highest lag. The same procedure was performed with the second and the third z scales and all combinations of them (see Fig. 1). The ACC terms are the average value for every interaction term at different lags, hence z(1)1 × z(1)2, z(1)1 × z(2)2, z(1)1 × z(3)2, etc. For short peptides such as signal peptides, the size of the maximal lag is dependent on the shortest peptide in a set, but for large polypeptides such as glycosyltransferases, the optimal lag seems to be between 15 and 25 amino acids. After optimization, a window size of 19 was chosen in this study, which gives 171 variables (19 × 3 × 3) for each sequence. Autocovariances with lag = 1, 2, 3... L were calculated by Equation 1, ACCj,lag=∑ln−lagzj,i×zj,i+lagn−lag(Eq. 1) Table IDescriptor scales for the coded amino acidsAmino acidz1z2z3Phe (F)−4.921.300.45Trp (W)−4.753.650.85Ile (I)−4.44−1.68−1.03Leu (L)−4.19−1.03−0.98Val (V)−2.69−2.53−1.29Met (M)−2.49−0.27−0.41Tyr (Y)−1.392.320.01Pro (P)−1.220.882.23Ala (A)0.07−1.730.09Cys (C)0.71−0.974.13Thr (T)0.92−2.09−1.40Ser (S)1.96−1.630.57Gln (Q)2.190.53−1.14Gly (G)2.23−5.360.30His (H)2.411.741.11Lys (K)2.841.41−3.14Arg (R)2.882.52−3.44Glu (E)3.080.039−0.07Asn (N)3.221.450.84Asp (D)3.641.132.36 Open table in a new tab where index j is used for the z scales (j = 1, 2, 3), index i is the amino acids position (i = 1, 2,... n), and n is the number of amino acids in the sequence (cf.Fig. 1).

ACCj≠k,lag=∑ln−lagzj,i×zk,i+lagn−lag Partial least squares projections to latent structures discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) finds the relationships between an X matrix and a Y matrix, i.e. it finds the relationship between sequence properties of the X matrix and a Y matrix defining the group membership (20Wold S. Eriksson L. Sjöström M. Schleyer V.R. Encyclopedia of Computational Chemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 2006-2022Google Scholar). In this study the Y matrix was composed of dummy variables, hence a value of 1 was given to members of the same group and 0 for non-members. The method uses a class membership in the Y matrix, that in PLS is composed of features that are responses to the variables in the X matrix, here fold group or reaction mechanism. PLS-DA uses the assumption that sequences belonging to the same class have common features and therefore will behave similarly in the analysis, as visualized in the score plot. This method can also be used to predict relationships for new unclassified sequences. In PLS-DA a multidimensional space is formed where every variable (e.g. z(1)1z(1)2, z(1)1z(2)2, z(1)1z(3)2) represents one dimension and every object (data from one sequence) is a point in this space. For the reference set, this means 141 points in a 171 dimensional space. To get the first PLS component a line that best approximates the data (best separates the objects according to group classification) is fitted to the multidimensional space, and the data points are projected onto this line to get coordinate values or scores. To get the second component, a new line is fitted to the data space that describes the second-most of the variation. Only two components are plotted at one time, hence the first, best separating dimension and the second in this work. The PLS model contains information both regarding the relationship among the objects (scores) and the contribution of the variables to the model (PLS weights). A weight plot shows the contribution of the variables for the separation, hence what periodic features that are responsible for the separation between the fold structures or reaction mechanisms. These features can then be searched for on the sequence level. The objects best separated, hence localized far away from the center of the plot, are the ones best described by the variables with the largest weight. Such variables are therefore most likely to be identified at the sequence level in these proteins. To evaluate the complexity, i.e. the numbers of PLS components to use in the model, cross-validation was preformed, where all objects are withdrawn, here 1/10 at a time, and their y values were predicted from an updated model based on 9/10 of the objects. This procedure was repeated ten times. A Q(cum)2 value was calculated that describes how much of the variance in the Y matrix can be predicted by the model. To obtain a perfect score of 1, all objects should be predicted back to the exact position given by the Y matrix. A Q(cum)2 larger then 0.1 corresponds to a 95% significance of the model (21Eriksson L. Johansson E. Kettaneh-Wold N. Wold S. Multi- and Megavariate Data Analysis Principles and Applications. Umetrics, Umeå2001Google Scholar). Sequence Alignment Methods—Lalign was used to make pair-wise sequence alignments (www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form-.html). To combine the pair-wise alignments ClustalW was used (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). The ACC variables were searched for in the sequences with the use of the established alignments from the above method. The sequences were translated to the z values found to be important followed by sliding along the translated sequences according to the ACC variable, e.g. aligning the first amino acid with the 18th according to variable z(1)1z(1)18 for the GT-A group (see results and Fig. 4 below). The products (according to e.g. z(1)1z(1)18) between the two aligned amino acids at the positions indicated were then calculated, and the values were compared for the aligned positions. Product values with equal signs (cf. z values in Table I), hence positive or negative values, were marked. These positions were indicated on the sequence alignment (cf.Fig. 4 below), and in selected protein structures using Swiss-PdbViewer (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar). The prediction of transmembrane segments was done using TMHMM at www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/(24Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8747) Google Scholar). Fold and Reaction Mechanism Revealed by Multivariate Analysis—Do glycosyltransferases contain sequence property periodicities related to protein architecture and enzyme function? GTs from prokaryotes and eukaryotes using many different substrates were used in the reference sets selected from the CAZy classification and mainly from families where members have at least one established crystal structure. A few related families were also included when needed. Proteins belonging to the same CAZy family are believed to have the same fold. Multivariate data analysis, here PLS-DA, could divide the glycosyltransferase sequences according to the established (or predicted) fold (Fig. 2). In the structure division between GT-A, GT-B, and the third newly discovered GT-C group, with transmembrane topology, a Q(cum)2 value of 0.730 was obtained (Fig. 2A). This is a high Q(cum)2 value (“prediction ability” of the model, maximum is 1.0; cf.“Experimental Procedures”), but the separation between GT-A and GT-B was less pronounced and partially overlapping. Note that the number of transmembrane segments seems to have less impact on the distribution of the GT-C sequences, i.e. no grouping. To further investigate the differences between the different fold groups, GT-A and GT-B were each analyzed separately with GT-C, yielding Q(cum)2 values of 0.868 (Fig. 2B) and 0.91 (data not shown), respectively. A division between the GT-A and GT-B yielded a Q(cum)2 of 0.655 (Fig. 2C). A further separation within the GT-A and GT-B groups was achieved on the basis of a reaction mechanism (Fig. 3, A and B), and Q(cum)2 values of 0.702 and 0.562, respectively, were obtained for the inverting and retaining clans within these 2-fold groups. Hence, multivariate ACC analyses of potential sequence property profiles for glycosyltransferases revealed clear groupings for fold and reaction mechanism by robust PLS models with high cross validation values.Fig. 3Division between the reaction stereochemistry within fold types.

Here only the corresponding weight plot for the division between retaining and inverting GTs for the GT-B group are shown (Fig. 3). Variables that are on the same side as the sequence class of interest in the score plot are positively correlated, and the variables on the diagonal side of the plot are negatively or oppositely correlated. The variable information was used to investigate if properties responsible for the separation of reaction mechanism could be outlined in the sequences. Sequences from proteins with known structure and the same reaction mechanism and fold were aligned to search for the variables in the sequences. The proteins used to represent the retaining enzymes of the GT-A fold group were: α3GalT (PDB, 1FG5) (25Gastinel L.N. Bignon C. Misra A.K. Hindsgaul O. Shaper J.H. Joziasse D.H.

The chosen sequences were aligned by various methods, both multiple (ClustalW) and pairwise (LALIGN) alignments, and for both full-length and partial protein sequences. This was performed to establish if there are any conserved regions between the different GT families achieving the same stereochemistry for the sugar linkage. A stretch of 84 amino acids in the retaining group (cf. above) could successfully be aligned. The members of family 6 and 8 have no significant sequence similarity when comparing the whole proteins. However, no long gap-free sequence alignment between all the different proteins belonging to the inverting group (cf. sequence Table in Supplementary Material) could be found using the above methods. A selection of variables with high weights found to be important for the reaction mechanism separation within fold group GT-A (as illustrated in Fig. 3) were (in rank) z(2)1z(3)13, z(2)1z(2)5, z(1)1z(1)18, z(2)1z(2)10, z(2)1z(1)4, and z(1)1z(1)14. Important variables at shorter distances were size (z(2)) and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity (z(1)) patterns, e.g. positions 1 to 4 and 1 to 5, corresponding to 3 and 4 amino acids apart, such as amino acids on the same side of a helix. Autocorrelation analyses have shown that proteins with several helices have a strong periodicity of hydrophobicity, of ∼3.7 (31Horne D.S. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is close to the 1 to 5 and 1 to 4 positions in this work (cf. above). The longer correlation distances (1 to 13, 1 to 18 above) are longer than the average lengths of alpha helices and beta strands in proteins, but in Rossman-like folds important functional residues are frequently found in the connecting loops (32Brändén C.-I.

https://openalex.org/W2021886371,"Previous results have indicated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus interferon-γ (IFNγ) inhibits nitric-oxide synthase (NOS)-I activity in glial cells. We report here that arachidonic acid (AA) plays a pivotal role in this response, which was consistently reproduced in different glial cell lines and in primary rat astrocytes. This notion was established using pharmacological inhibitors of phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) antisense oligonucleotides, and AA add-back experiments. This approach not only allowed the demonstration that AA promotes inhibition of NOS-I activity but also produced novel experimental evidence that LPS/IFNγ itself is a potential stimulus for NOS-I. Indeed, LPS/IFNγ fails to generate nitric oxide (NO) via NOS-I activation simply because it activates the AA-dependent signal that impedes NOS-I activity. Otherwise, LPS/IFNγ promotes NO formation, sensitive to exogenous AA, in cells in which cPLA2 is pharmacologically inhibited or genetically depleted. Because NO suppresses the NFκB-dependent NOS-II expression, inactivation of NOS-I by the LPS/IFNγ-induced AA pathway provides optimal conditions for NFκB activation and subsequent NOS-II expression. Inhibition of cPLA2 activity, while reducing the availability of AA, consistently inhibited NFκB activation and NOS-II mRNA induction and delayed NO formation. These responses were promptly reestablished by addition of exogenous AA. Finally, we have demonstrated that the LPS/IFNγ-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-I and inhibition of its activity are mediated by endogenous AA."
https://openalex.org/W2063854858,"Four isoforms (α, β, γ, and δ) have been identified for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). It has been reported that STAT3γ, which is derived from STAT3α by limited proteolysis during granulocytic differentiation, is a major STAT3 isoform expressed in human neutrophils. We confirmed that STAT3γ was a major STAT3 isoform detected in human neutrophil lysates prepared with the conventional lysis buffer. The enzymes capable of converting STAT3α to STAT3γ in vitro were localized in neutrophil granule fraction and were released into the medium upon ionomycin stimulation. The enzyme activity was strongly inhibited by phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, CuSO4, and ONO-5046 (a specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase), but not by aprotinin, leupeptin, benzamidine, and EDTA. STAT3γ was effectively generated in vitro from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with human neutrophil elastase or proteinase 3 but not cathepsin G. The converting activity in neutrophil lysates was reduced by immunodepletion of elastase but not proteinase 3. Unexpectedly, STAT3γ was undetected in the lysates of neutrophil-derived cytoplasts, which lack granules, and the cytosol fraction prepared by nitrogen cavitation. The STAT3 isoform detected in these preparations was primarily STAT3α. STAT3γ was also undetected in the lysates of PMSF-pretreated neutrophils and was markedly decreased in the lysates of ionomycin-pretreated neutrophils. These findings indicate that, in contrast to the previous reports, STAT3α, but not STAT3γ, is primarily expressed in human neutrophils, and STAT3γ is rapidly generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with granule-derived serine proteases during preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer.

STAT3β (83 kDa) is an alternatively spliced isoform, in which the 55 C-terminal amino acid residues of STAT3α, spanning the intrinsic transactivation domain, are replaced by seven distinct residues (11Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Google Scholar). STAT3γ (72 kDa) is a C-terminal truncated form of STAT3α, and it has been proposed that STAT3γ is produced by limited proteolysis of STAT3α during granulocytic differentiation (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar). STAT3δ (64 kDa) may be also a truncated isoform expressed in the early stage of granulocytic differentiation (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar). These distinct STAT3 isoforms may be involved in specific biological functions, depending upon the cell types and the differentiation stage of myeloid cells (1Levy D.E. Lee C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1143-1148Google Scholar, 4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 6Yoo J.Y. Huso D.L. Nathans D. Desiderio S.

STAT3γ is a major STAT3 isoform expressed in human neutrophils and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation of neutrophils with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF). Our recent study shows that STAT3 is involved in G-CSF-mediated up-regulation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 2 in human neutrophils, leading to prolongation of neutrophil survival (9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar). STAT3 may be also involved in the GM-CSF-mediated anti-apoptotic effect upon human neutrophils through up-regulation of Mcl-1 (8Epling-Burnette P.K. Zhong B. Bai F. Jiang K. Bailey R.D. Garcia R. Jove R. Djeu J.Y. Loughran Jr., T.P. Wei S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7486-7495Google Scholar). Thus, it seems that STAT3, and possibly the γ isoform (STAT3γ), may play an important role in the regulation of neutrophil survival. However, the enzymes involved in proteolytic conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ remain to be identified. In the present experiments, we sought to identify the enzymes responsible for conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in human neutrophils. The results show that, unexpectedly, STAT3γ is absent in intact human neutrophils, and STAT3α, but not STAT3γ, is primarily expressed in human neutrophils. The results also show that STAT3γ is rapidly generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with granule-derived serine proteases during preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. Materials—Human neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Human neutrophil proteinase 3 was purchased from Elastin Products Co., Inc. (Owensville, MO). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), aprotinin, leupeptin, benzamidine, cytochalasin B, ionomycin, and Ficoll-70 were purchased from Sigma. Conray was purchased from Mallinckrodt (St. Louis, MO), Ficoll was purchased from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Piscataway, NJ), and ONO-5046, a specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase (13Kawabata K. Suzuki M. Sugitani M. Imaki K. Toda M. Miyamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 814-820Google Scholar), was provided by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against STAT3, which recognizes the N-terminal portion of STAT3, and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human neutrophil elastase was purchased from Athens Research Technologies (Athens, GA), goat polyclonal antibody against human proteinase 3 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from DAKO (Glostrup, Denmark), and protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting system were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, England). Preparation of Cells—Human neutrophils and mononuclear cells were prepared from healthy adult donors as described previously (9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar), using dextran sedimentation, centrifugation with Conray-Ficoll, and hypotonic lysis of contaminated erythrocytes. Neutrophil fractions contained >98% neutrophils. Lymphocytes were further purified from mononuclear cells by centrifugal elutriation in a Hitachi SRR6Y elutriation rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) (14Yuo A. Kitagawa S. Motoyoshi K. Azuma E. Saito M. Takaku F. Blood. 1992; 79: 1553-1557Google Scholar). Lymphocyte fractions contained >99% lymphocytes. Cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Preparation of Cytoplasts—Cytoplasts were prepared from 1 × 108 neutrophils as described previously (15Roos D. Voetman A.A. Meerhof L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 368-377Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were centrifuged through a discontinuous Ficoll-70 gradient (12.5, 16, and 25%) prewarmed to 37 °C and containing 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B. Centrifugation was performed for 30 min at 34 °C in a Hitachi CP100α ultracentrifuge with a P28S2 swing rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo) at 81,000 × g. After centrifugation, the top band of cellular material was collected. This band was composed of >99% cytoplasts, as assessed by light microscopy of cytospin preparations stained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Cytoplasts were recognized by their absence of a nucleus. Cytoplasts were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (2 × 108 cytoplasts/ml). Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described previously (9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar). Cells were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml aprotinin (the conventional lysis buffer) and were lysed for 10 min at 4 °C. After rapid centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as the cell lysates. The cell lysates or samples were mixed 4:1 with 5× sample buffer (10% SDS, 50% glycerol, 25% 2-mercaptoethanol, and a trace amount of bromphenol blue dye in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and were boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to 4–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reduced condition. After electrophoresis, proteins were electrophoretically transferred from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol at 2 mA/cm2 for 1 h at room temperature. Residual binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubating the membrane in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with anti-STAT3 antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and the antibody complexes were visualized by the ECL detection system as directed by the manufacturer. In Vitro Conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ—The proteolytic conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in vitro was analyzed in the cell-free system using neutrophil and lymphocyte lysates. Both cell lysates were prepared with the protease inhibitor-free lysis buffer containing 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. The lymphocyte lysates contained abundant STAT3α, which was used as a substrate to determine the activity for conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. Neutrophil and lymphocyte lysates were mixed at 1:50 on the basis of cell number: i.e. 0.5 μl of neutrophil lysates equivalent to 5 × 104 cells and 25 μl of lymphocyte lysates equivalent to 2.5 × 106 cells were mixed with each other. When required, neutrophil lysates were replaced by other samples such as the cytosol fraction and the lysates of cytoplasts and granule fraction. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 15–60 min at 37 °C, and thereafter, the immunoblotting was performed using the anti-STAT3 antibody. Immunodepletion of Elastase and Proteinase 3 from Neutrophil Lysates—Protein G-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-elastase or anti-proteinase 3 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. After washing, the beads were mixed with neutrophil lysates (20 μl) prepared with the protease inhibitor-free lysis buffer, and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, allowing the binding of elastase or proteinase 3 to the antibody-coated beads. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as the sample immunodepleted for elastase or proteinase 3. The depletion of each protease from neutrophil lysates was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-elastase or anti-proteinase 3 antibody. Treatment of Neutrophils with PMSF or Ionomycin—PMSF- or ionomycin-pretreated neutrophils were prepared by treatment of neutrophils with PMSF (1 mm) for 1 h or ionomycin (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. PMSF- or ionomycin-pretreated neutrophils were washed with PBS and lysed with the conventional lysis buffer. The cell-free supernatant from ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils was used as granule enzymes released into the medium upon ionomycin stimulation. Disruption of Neutrophils by Nitrogen Cavitation—Disruption of neutrophils by nitrogen cavitation was performed as described previously (16Kjeldsen L. Sengelov H. Borregaard N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 232: 131-143Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils (1 × 108 cells/ml) were suspended in the disruption buffer containing 10 mm PIPES (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1mm ATP, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride and were pressurized with nitrogen for 5 min at 380 psi (pounds per square inch) in a nitrogen bomb (Parr Instrument, Moline, IL) at 4 °C. After release from the cavitation bomb, the cavitate was collected dropwise into EGTA to a final concentration of 1.5 mm. Disrupted cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 400 × g to obtain the nuclear fraction. The postnuclear supernatant was further centrifuged for 15 min at 18,000 × g to obtain the granule and cytosol fractions. The nuclear and granule fractions were lysed with the protease inhibitor-free lysis buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 18,000 × g to obtain the lysates. By this method, most activity (>95%) of elastase, an enzyme in the primary granule, was detected in the granule fraction when elastase activity was determined using methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide as a substrate (17Nakajima K. Powers J.C. Ashe B.M. Zimmerman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4027-4032Google Scholar). Proteolytic Conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ by Neutrophil Lysates—Neutrophil and lymphocyte lysates were prepared with the conventional lysis buffer containing various protease inhibitors, and STAT3 isoforms were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody, which recognizes the N-terminal portion of STAT3. As shown in Fig. 1A, three bands were detected in neutrophil lysates. Each band may correspond to STAT3α, STAT3β, and STAT3γ on the basis of molecular mass (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 10Benekli M. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2940-2954Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar). In lymphocyte lysates, one band, which corresponds to STAT3α, was detected. If STAT3γ were produced by limited proteolysis of STAT3α in intact neutrophils (12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar), neutrophil lysates would contain proteases capable of converting STAT3α to STAT3γ. To demonstrate this activity, neutrophil and lymphocyte lysates prepared with the protease inhibitor-free lysis buffer were mixed to each other, and the mixtures were incubated for 15–60 min at 37 °C, followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, STAT3α was cleaved within 15 min after incubation of the mixtures. The cleavage of STAT3α was accompanied with the concomitant appearance of lower molecular mass bands of ∼83 and 72 kDa, which apparently correspond to STAT3β and STAT3γ, respectively. Incubation of lymphocyte lysates alone resulted in no cleavage of STAT3α. These findings indicate that neutrophil, but not lymphocyte, lysates contain proteases, which can mediate the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. The converting activity was markedly inhibited by PMSF, but not inhibited by aprotinin, leupeptin, benzamidine, and EDTA (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ may be mediated by certain serine proteases. The Converting Activity Is Localized in the Granule Fraction—Neutrophils were disrupted by nitrogen cavitation, and disrupted samples were separated into the cytosol, nuclear, and granule fractions. Each fraction was analyzed for the activity of conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. Strong converting activity was detected in the granule fraction, which gave the proteolytic profile of STAT3α identical to that obtained with whole neutrophil lysates (Fig. 2A). The nuclear fraction showed a slight converting activity, presumably because of contaminated granules and/or undisrupted neutrophils. Unexpectedly, the converting activity was undetected in the cytosol fraction. These findings indicate that the converting activity is primarily localized in neutrophil granules but not in the cytosol. To obtain additional evidence that the converting enzymes are localized in granules, neutrophils were stimulated with ionomycin to release granule enzymes into the medium, and the converting activity in the medium was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2B, the converting activity was detected in the cell-free supernatant from ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils but not that from unstimulated control cells. These findings also suggest that the converting enzymes are localized in granules and released upon ionomycin stimulation. Conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ by Granule-derived Serine Proteases—The results depicted in Figs. 1 and 2 suggest that certain serine proteases in granules are responsible for the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. The major serine proteases in human neutrophil granules are elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The possible conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ by these proteases was assessed by adding purified human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3 to lymphocyte lysates; the reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by immunoblotting with anti-STAT3 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3A, STAT3α was cleaved by elastase or proteinase 3, and the cleavage of STAT3α was accompanied by the concomitant appearance of lower molecular mass bands of ∼83 and 72 kDa, apparently corresponding to STAT3β and STAT3γ, respectively. Elastase was more potent than proteinase 3 in this effect. On the other hand, STAT3α was rapidly degraded by cathepsin G, leaving no band detectable by anti-STAT3 antibody. These findings suggest that elastase and proteinase 3 could contribute to the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ, with elastase being more potent than proteinase 3. To determine whether elastase participates in the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in the cell-free system composed of neutrophil and lymphocyte lysates, the effects of Cu2+ (a potent inhibitor of elastase; Ref. 18Britz M.L. Lowther D.A. Aust. J. Exp. Biol. Med. Sci. 1981; 59: 63-75Google Scholar) and ONO-5046 (a specific inhibitor of neutrophil elastase; Ref. 13Kawabata K. Suzuki M. Sugitani M. Imaki K. Toda M. Miyamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 814-820Google Scholar) were studied. As shown in Fig. 3B, the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ was completely abolished by Cu2+ and was markedly inhibited by ONO-5046, suggesting that elastase plays a major role in the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in this cell-free system. This notion was also supported by the finding that the converting activity in neutrophil lysates was reduced when elastase, but not proteinase 3, was immunodepleted from neutrophil lysates by using the antibody-coated beads (Fig. 3C). Absence of STAT3γ in the Cytosol Fraction and Cytoplasts— STAT3γ was consistently detected in whole neutrophil lysates prepared with the conventional lysis buffer containing various protease inhibitors (Figs. 1, 2, 3; Refs. 4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar). However, the results depicted in Figs. 1, 2, 3 suggest that granule enzymes participate in the appearance of STAT3γ despite the fact that STAT3 is localized primarily in the cytoplasm of resting cells. These findings raise the possibility that STAT3α might be highly susceptible to the proteolytic cleavage by granule enzymes, and STAT3γ might be generated solely from STAT3α during preparation of neutrophil lysates. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4, STAT3γ was undetected in the cytosol fraction prepared by nitrogen cavitation. The cytosol fraction prepared by this method lacks granules, and most activity (>95%) of elastase, a primary granule enzyme, was detected in the granule fraction (data not shown). The STAT3 isoform detected in the cytosol fraction was primarily STAT3α, with a faint band of STAT3β (Fig. 4). To obtain additional evidence, we prepared neutrophil-derived cytoplasts, which lack a nucleus, granules, and mitochondria (15Roos D. Voetman A.A. Meerhof L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 368-377Google Scholar). STAT3γ was also undetected in cytoplast lysates. The STAT3 isoform detected in cytoplast lysates was primarily STAT3α, with a faint band of STAT3β, a profile identical to that observed in the cytosol fraction (Fig. 4). These findings indicate that STAT3γ is absent in intact human neutrophils. Decreased Level of STAT3γ in PMSF- and Ionomycin-pretreated Neutrophils—The absence of STAT3γ in the cytosol fraction and cytoplast lysates suggests that STAT3γ may be generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis during preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. Because the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ by neutrophil lysates was strongly inhibited by PMSF (Fig. 1B), neutrophils were treated with PMSF (1 mm) for sufficient time (1 h) at 37 °C, and thereafter, neutrophil lysates were prepared with the conventional lysis buffer. As shown in Fig. 4, both STAT3β and STAT3γ almost disappeared, with a concomitant increase of STAT3α by pretreatment of neutrophils with PMSF. In addition, the lysates from ionomycin-pretreated neutrophils, which already released granule enzymes capable of converting STAT3α to STAT3γ (Fig. 2B), showed a remarkable decrease of STAT3γ and an increase of STAT3α (Fig. 4). These findings also support the concept that STAT3γ may be generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with granule-derived serine proteases during preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. It has been reported that STAT3γ is a major STAT3 isoform expressed in human neutrophils and generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis during differentiation into mature neutrophils (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar, 10Benekli M. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2940-2954Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar). In fact, STAT3γ is a major STAT3 isoform phosphorylated in human neutrophils stimulated by G-CSF or GM-CSF, and STAT3 activation has been demonstrated to be involved in G-CSF- or GM-CSF-mediated prolongation of neutrophil survival (9Hasegawa T. Suzuki K. Sakamoto C. Ohta K. Nishiki S. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 2003; 101: 1164-1171Google Scholar, 19Sakamoto C. Suzuki K. Hato F. Akahori M. Hasegawa T. Hino M. Kitagawa S. Int. J. Hematol. 2003; 77: 60-70Google Scholar). The appearance of STAT3γ during granulocytic differentiation also suggests a possible role of STAT3γ in the regulation of granulocytic differentiation (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar). These previous observations strongly indicate that STAT3γ may play an important role in the functional regulation of myeloid cells and prompted us to identify the proteolytic enzymes responsible for conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. The results presented here show that, unexpectedly, STAT3γ is absent in intact human neutrophils, and the major isoform expressed in human neutrophils is STAT3α, suggesting that the STAT3 isoform involved in neutrophil functions is primarily STAT3α and not STAT3γ. In addition, the results show that STAT3α is highly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by neutrophil granule-derived serine proteases, and both STAT3β and STAT3γ are rapidly generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with granule-derived proteases, especially elastase, during the preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. These findings indicate that careful interpretation and analysis should be performed to determine the role and expression profile of STAT3 isoform in myeloid cells. The absence of STAT3γ in intact human neutrophils is supported by the findings that STAT3γ was undetected in cytoplast lysates and the cytosol fraction prepared by nitrogen cavitation. Instead, abundant STAT3α was detected in cytoplast lysates and the cytosol fraction. In addition, the cytosol fraction did not contain the activity for conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in the cell-free system. These findings suggest that STAT3α is highly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by certain neutrophil proteases and is rapidly cleaved to generate STAT3γ during the preparation of neutrophil lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. Consistent with this is the finding that STAT3γ was undetected in the lysates of PMSF-pretreated neutrophils. The high susceptibility of STAT3α to limited proteolysis by neutrophil-derived proteases is also supported by the finding that other proteins such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase are not cleaved under the same conditions (20Suzuki K. Hino M. Hato F. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. Blood. 1999; 93: 341-349Google Scholar, 21Suzuki K. Hasegawa T. Sakamoto C. Zhou Y. Hato F. Hino M. Tatsumi N. Kitagawa S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1185-1192Google Scholar). The activity for conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ in the cell-free system was detected in neutrophil lysates but not in lymphocyte lysates. The profile of cleavage products of STAT3α obtained in the cell-free system was identical to that of STAT3 isoforms detected in whole neutrophil lysates. The fractionation study revealed that the converting activity was detected solely in the granule fraction. The converting activity was also detected in the cell-free supernatant from ionomycin-stimulated neutrophils, with a concomitant decrease in its activity in cells, indicating that the converting enzymes could be released to the extracellular milieu upon ionomycin stimulation. All of these findings indicate that granule enzymes are responsible for the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. Among granule enzymes studied, purified human neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3, but not cathepsin G, were found to cleave STAT3α to generate STAT3γ, when assessed on the basis of molecular mass. Elastase was more potent than proteinase 3 in this effect, and the converting activity in neutrophil lysates was reduced by immunodepletion of elastase but not proteinase 3. These findings and the remarkable inhibition of conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ by Cu2+ and ONO-5046 taken together indicate that elastase may be primarily responsible for the conversion of STAT3α to STAT3γ. The appearance of STAT3γ during granulocytic differentiation (4Hevehan D.L. Miller W.M. Papoutsakis E.T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1627-1637Google Scholar, 12Chakraborty A. Tweardy D.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 675-680Google Scholar) may be explained by the synthesis of primary granule enzymes, including elastase, during granulocytic differentiation, which may generate STAT3γ from STAT3α during the preparation of cell lysates with the conventional lysis buffer. It has been reported that STAT3β is expressed in leukemic blasts from most patients (∼80%) with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and constitutive activation of STAT3β is associated with short disease-free survival (22Xia Z. Salzler R.R. Kunz D.P. Baer M.R. Kazim L. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1747-1753Google Scholar, 23Benekli M. Xia Z. Donohue K.A. Ford L.A. Pixley L.A. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2002; 99: 252-257Google Scholar). In these previous studies, the expression of STAT3β was analyzed using whole-cell lysates, and STAT3β in AML blasts was found to be generated primarily from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with PMSF-sensitive serine proteases but not by alternative mRNA splicing (22Xia Z. Salzler R.R. Kunz D.P. Baer M.R. Kazim L. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1747-1753Google Scholar). These findings raise the possibility that STAT3β detected in AML blasts might be, at least in part, generated from STAT3α by limited proteolysis with granule enzymes during the preparation of cell lysates, as demonstrated in the present experiments with human neutrophils. Further detailed analysis is required to conclude that a large amount of STAT3β is, in fact, expressed in intact leukemic blasts in some cases, although it is possible that the processing of STAT3α may be dysregulated in certain AML cases. In addition, it should be determined whether STAT3β derived from proteolysis of STAT3α exhibits the same function as STAT3β derived from alternative mRNA splicing. In this regard, it is of interest that neutrophil elastase cleaves promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor (PML-RAR)α and is important for the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia in mice, although it is unknown how elastase in primary granules could encounter PML-RARα, which exists in a nucleus (24Lane A.A. Ley T.J. Cell. 2003; 115: 305-318Google Scholar). In any case, the present experiments demonstrate that STAT3α, but not STAT3γ, is primarily expressed in human neutrophils, and STAT3α, but not STAT3γ, may play a role in the regulation of neutrophil functions such as neutrophil survival.

https://openalex.org/W2004084911,"The synaptotagmin-like protein homologue lacking C2 domains-a (Slac2-a)/melanophilin was recently identified as the missing link between the small GTPase Rab27A and the actin-based motor protein myosin Va. Although formation of a tripartite protein complex by three molecules had been shown to be required for proper melanosome distribution in melanocytes (Kuroda, T. S., Ariga, H., and Fukuda, M. (2003) Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 5245-5255), the regulatory mechanisms of the complex (i.e. assembly and disassembly of the complex) had never been elucidated. In this study, we discovered that Slac2-a and a closely related isoform, Slac2-c/MyRIP, contain multiple PEST-like sequences (potential signals for rapid protein degradation) in the myosin Va- and actin-binding domains at the C terminus. We found that the C-terminal domain of Slac2-a is highly sensitive to low concentrations of proteases, such as trypsin and calpain, in vitro, whereas the N-terminal Rab27A-binding domain is highly resistant to these proteases. We further found that endogenous calpains selectively cleave Slac2-a, but not Rab27A or myosin Va, in melanocytes. A mutant Slac2-a lacking one of the PEST-like sequences located at the interface between the myosin Va- and actin-binding domains (DeltaPEST; amino acids 399-405) is more stable than the wild-type protein, both in vitro and in melanocytes. Expression of the mutant Slac2-a-DeltaPEST with an N-terminal green fluorescence protein tag often induced perinuclear aggregation of melanosomes ( approximately 40% of the transfected cells) compared with the wild-type Slac2-a. Our findings suggest that protein degradation of Slac2-a is an essential process for proper melanosome distribution in melanocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2057754020,"Microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) plays a central role in xenobiotic metabolism as well as mediating the sodium-dependent uptake of bile acids into the liver, where these compounds regulate numerous biological processes such as cholesterol metabolism and hepatocyte signaling pathways. Little is known, however, about the factors that control the constitutive and inducible expression of the mEH gene (<i>EPHX1</i>) that is altered during development and in response to numerous xenobiotics. In previous studies we have established that GATA-4 binding to the <i>EPHX1</i> core promoter is critical for <i>EPHX1</i> expression. The –80/+25 bp core promoter also contained a reversed CCAAT box (–5/–1 bp), integrity of which was required for maximal basal <i>EPHX1</i> transcription in HepG2 cells. Transient transfection of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) substantially stimulated <i>EPHX1</i> promoter activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, however, revealed that nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), but not C/EBPα, directly bound to this site although increased expression of NF-Y had no effect on <i>EPHX1</i> promoter activity. These results suggested that C/EBPα activated <i>EPHX1</i> expression through its interaction with NF-Y bound to the CCAAT box. The existence of a C/EBPα[NF-Y] complex was supported by electrophoretic mobility shift assays using antibodies against NF-Y and C/EBPα as well as by the ability of a dominant-negative NF-Y expression vector to inhibit promoter activity. The interaction between these transcription factors was established by co-immunoprecipitation analysis and glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase pull-down assays, whereas the association of the two factors and the interaction of NF-Y with the CCAAT box <i>in vivo</i> was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. C/EBPα-dependent <i>EPHX1</i> activation was also supported by reconstitution studies in HeLa cells that lack this protein. These results establish that <i>EPHX1</i> expression is regulated by C/EBPα interacting with DNA-bound NF-Y."

https://openalex.org/W2048510003,"Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) is a novel glycosaminoglycan hydrolase that releases unsaturated d-glucuronic acid from oligosaccharides produced by polysaccharide lyases. The x-ray crystallographic structure of UGL from Bacillus sp. GL1 was first determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (mir) and refined at 1.8 Å resolution with a final R-factor of 16.8% for 25 to 1.8 Å resolution data. The refined UGL structure consists of 377 amino acid residues and 478 water molecules, four glycine molecules, two dithiothreitol (DTT) molecules, and one 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD) molecule. UGL includes an α6/α6-barrel, whose structure is found in the six-hairpin enzyme superfamily of an α/α-toroidal fold. One side of the UGL α6/α6-barrel structure consists of long loops containing three short β-sheets and contributes to the formation of a deep pocket. One glycine molecule and two DTT molecules surrounded by highly conserved amino acid residues in UGLs were found in the pocket, suggesting that catalytic and substrate-binding sites are located in this pocket. The overall UGL structure, with the exception of some loops, very much resembled that of the Bacillus subtilis hypothetical protein Yter, whose function is unknown and which exhibits little amino acid sequence identity with UGL. In the active pocket, residues possibly involved in substrate recognition and catalysis by UGL are conserved in UGLs and Yter.

Polysaccharides exist ubiquitously in nature as components of the extracellular matrix on the cell surface of many different organisms, ranging from bacteria to mammals (1Scott J.E. J. Anat. 1995; 187: 259-269Google Scholar). These polysaccharides are important to a variety of biological and functional activities, and are divided into three groups: i.e. storage, e.g. starch; structural, e.g. cellulose; and functional, e.g. glycosaminoglycan. Glycosaminoglycans such as hyaluronan, chondroitin, and heparin are linear, negatively charged polysaccharides with a repeating disaccharide unit consisting of a uronic acid residue (glucuronic or iduronic acid) and an amino sugar residue (glucosamine or galactosamine) (2Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Google Scholar). Hyaluronan consists of d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) 1The abbreviations used are: GlcA, d-glucuronic acid; UGL, unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; GlcNAc, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine; ΔGlcA, unsaturated d-glucuronic acid; GalNAc, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine; Glc, d-glucose; Rha, l-rhamnose; Man, d-mannose; mir, multiple isomorphous replacement; r.m.s., root mean square; AGE, N-acyl-d-glucosamine 2-epimerase. and N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc) (Fig. 1a) and plays an important role in cell-to-cell association in mammals and as a capsule in streptococcal bacteria (3Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Google Scholar). This polysaccharide is widely present in such human tissues as the eye, brain, liver, skin, and blood (4Lindahl U. Hook M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 385-417Google Scholar). Chondroitin, also a member of the glycosaminoglycan family, consists of GlcA and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) with a sulfate group(s) at position 4 or 6 or both (5Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Google Scholar) (Fig. 1b). Mammalian chondroitin covalently bound with proteins plays an important role in cellular architecture and permeability (5Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Google Scholar). These glycosaminoglycans in the extracellular matrix may be a target for pathogens that invade host cells, and many pathogens have been reported to show specific interaction with these polysaccharides (6Sawitzky D. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 1996; 184: 155-161Google Scholar). Certain streptococci such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae cause severe infectious disease, e.g. pneumonia, bacteremia, sinusitis, and meningitis, and produce polysaccharide lyases, which function as virulence factors in the degradation of hyaluronan and chondroitin (7Linker A. Meyer K. Weissmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 213: 237-248Google Scholar, 8Boulnois G.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1992; 138: 249-259Google Scholar). Lyases for haluronan and chondroitin recognize GlcA residues in polysaccharides and produce unsaturated disaccharides with a GlcA residue having a C=C double bond at the nonreducing terminus through the β-elimination reaction. Unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase (UGL) catalyzes the hydrolysis of unsaturated disaccharides to an amino sugar and an unsaturated GlcA (ΔGlcA), which is nonenzymatically converted immediately to α-keto acid (Fig. 1) (9Hashimoto W. Kobayashi E. Nankai H. Sato N. Miya T. Kawai S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Google Scholar). The enzyme is thus thought to be another virulent factor responsible for the complete degradation of glycosaminoglycans. Although a gene coding for UGL was first cloned from Bacillus sp. GL1 that degrades bacterial biofilms such as xanthan, which is produced by pathogenic xanthomonads, and gellan, which is produced by pathogenic sphingomonads (Fig. 1, c and d) (10Hashimoto W. Maesaka K. Sato N. Kimura S. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 17-23Google Scholar, 11Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Miki H. Kawai S. Murata K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2520-2526Google Scholar), highly homologous genes are distributed in pathogenic streptococci that produce polysaccharide lyases (12Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Google Scholar). We thus defined UGL as a novel member of hydrolase for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and bacterial biofilms, and the enzyme belongs to a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH-88, in the CAZY data base. 2B. Henrissat, P. Coutinho, and E. Deleury, afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html. Inhibitors of polysaccharide lyases and UGL are expected to become potent pharmaceuticals for treating streptococci infectious disease. Structural analysis of polysaccharide lyases and UGL is indispensable for clarifying molecular mechanisms underlying catalysis and recognition of substrates, and sequential reaction mechanisms involved in polysaccharide depolymerization by bacteria. The crystal structures of polysaccharide lyases such as those for pectate (13Yoder M.D. Keen N.T. Jurnak F. Science. 1993; 260: 1503-1507Google Scholar, 14Akita M. Suzuki A. Kobayashi T. Ito S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 7663-7673Google Scholar) have been determined, and the structural and functional relationship of these lyases have been studied. No three-dimensional structure has been clarified for any UGL, however. This article deals with the crystal structure of UGL, a novel hydrolase for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans and bacterial biofilms, from Bacillus sp. GL1 determined by x-ray crystallography at 1.8 Å resolution and the identification of the active site. The structure provides useful information on the catalytic mechanism and for the molecular design of drugs for the treatment of streptococci, xanthomonad, and sphingomonad infectious diseases. Crystallization and X-ray Diffraction—UGL of Bacillus sp. GL1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and crystallized by sittingdrop vapor diffusion as described elsewhere (21Mori S. Akao S. Miyake O. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 946-949Google Scholar). UGL crystals were soaked in a heavy atom derivative solution containing 1 mm of K2PtCl4, 1 mm of Hg(CH3COO)2, or 0.5 mm of NaAuCl4 for 15–50 min at 20 °C. These heavy atom solutions were prepared in 52% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD), 0.12 m of sodium chloride, 0.1 m of glycine, and 0.1 m of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6). The crystals we used were removed from a droplet on a mounted nylon loop (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA), and placed in a cold nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. X-ray diffraction images of the UGL crystal (Native 1) were collected using a Quantum 4R CCD area detector (ADSC) with synchrotron radiation at a wavelength of 0.72 Å at the BL-38B1 station of SPring-8. Images were processed with DENZO and SCALEPACK software (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar) to a resolution of 1.8 Å (Table I). Diffraction images of another crystal (Native 2) and derivative crystals for phasing were collected with a Bruker Hi-Star multiwire area detector using CuKα radiation generated by a MAC Science M18XHF rotating anode generator, and were processed with SADIE and SAINT software (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany).Table ISynchrotron radiation data collection and refinement statistics for a UGL crystal (Native 1)Crystal systemHexagonalSpace groupP6522Unit cell parameters (Å)a = b = 103.01, c = 223.04Molecules/asym. unit1Data collectionResolution limit (last shell)aData in highest resolution shells are given in parentheses (Å)25.0–1.80 (1.86–1.80)Measured reflections (last shell)300,292 (24083)Unique reflections (last shell)63,892 (6175)Redundancy (last shell)4.7 (3.9)Completeness (I > σI) (last shell) (%)97.6 (96.0)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σ|Ii – 〈I〉 /ΣIi × 100, where Ii is the intensity of individual reflection and 〈I〉 the mean intensity of all reflections9.6 (29.5)RefinementFinal model377 residues, 478 water, 4 glycine, 2 DTT, and 1 MPDResolution limit (last shell) (Å)25.0–1.80 (1.91 -1.80)Used reflections (last shell)63,316 (9024)Completeness (F > 2σ F) (last shell) (%)96.7 (93.9)Average B-factor (Å2)16.3R-factor (last shell) (%)cR-factor = ΣFo – Fc/Σ|Fo| × 100, where Fo is the observed structure factor and Fc the calculated structure factor16.8 (22.4)Rfree (last shell) (%)dRfree was calculated from a randomly chosen 10% of reflections as defined by the CNS18.9 (24.6)R.m.s. deviationsBond (Å)0.005Angle (deg)1.22a Data in highest resolution shells are given in parenthesesb Rmerge = Σ|Ii – 〈I〉 /ΣIi × 100, where Ii is the intensity of individual reflection and 〈I〉 the mean intensity of all reflectionsc R-factor = ΣFo – Fc/Σ|Fo| × 100, where Fo is the observed structure factor and Fc the calculated structure factord Rfree was calculated from a randomly chosen 10% of reflections as defined by the CNS Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The UGL crystal structure was determined by multiple isomorphous replacement (mir).

Major sites of heavy atoms were determined by the interpretation of difference Patterson maps calculated at a resolution of 6.0–3.5 Å. Additional heavy atom sites were determined from difference Fourier maps. Phasing results are listed in Table II. The mean figure of merit was 0.426. The phase was greatly improved and the mean figure of merit increased to 0.754 after solvent flattening (24Wang B.C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar) with a PHASES program. Initial model building was done with Native 2 data sets and the phase at 3.5 Å using the TURBO-FRODO program (AFMB-CNRS, Marseille, France) on a Silicon Graphics Octane computer. Simulated annealing refinement was done with this model and 25–2.5 Å resolution data from Native 1 data sets with CNS ver. 1.1 (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The model was heated to 3,000 K, then slowly cooled to 300 K (time step, 0.5 fs; decrease in temperature, 25 K; number of steps at each temperature, 50), and 200 cycles of Powell minimization were done. Fo - Fc and 2 Fo - Fc maps were used to locate the correct model. Several rounds of positional and B-factor refinement, followed by manual model building, were done to improve the model by increasing data to a resolution of 1.8 Å. Water molecules were incorporated where the difference density exceeded the mean by 3.0 σ or more and the 2 Fo - Fc map showed a density exceeding 1.0 σ. Seven fragments of nonprotein or nonwater density were modeled into four glycine molecules, two dithiothreitol (DTT) molecules, and one MPD molecule from the crystallization medium, and density was excellent for the whole molecule. The final R-factor was 16.8% for 63,316 data points with F > 2.0σ (F) in a resolution of 25.0–1.8 Å (96.7% completeness). The R-free value calculated for randomly separated 10% data was 18.9%. The stereoquality of the model was assessed using the PRO-CHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and WHAT-CHECK (27Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Google Scholar) programs. Structural similarity was searched for in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (28Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) using the DALI program (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar). Coordinates of hypothetical protein Yter (1NC5) were taken from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. UGL and Yter models were superimposed by a fitting program in TURBO-FRODO. Ribbon plots were prepared using the MOLSCRIPT (30Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar), RASTER3D (31Merrit E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

The plasmid pET3a-UGL, which is the expression vector for wild-type UGL (12Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Google Scholar), was used as a template. Primers were as follows: D88N (Asp88 → Asn88), 5′-AGAATCTCGATCATCACAACATCGGCTTCCTATACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGTATAGGAAGCCGATGTTGTGATGATCGAGATTCT-3′; and D149N (Asp149 → Asn149), 5′-GGACGCATCATCATCAACTGCCTGCTGAATCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGATTCAGCAGGCAGTTGATGATGATGCGTCC-3′ (mutations are indicated by bold letters). The E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with plasmids having a mutation, i.e. pET3a-UGL(D88N) and pET3a-UGL(D149N). Mutant enzymes were expressed and purified as for wild-type UGL (12Mori S. Akao S. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 29: 77-84Google Scholar). Structural conformations of purified wild-type and mutant enzymes were evaluated by far-UV CD spectroscopy using a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at 190–260 nm with a demountable quartz cell having a 0.1-mm path length. Enzyme Assay—UGL reactions for the wild-type and mutants were conducted at 30 °C as follows: The reaction mixture consisted of 50 mm of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 20–500 μm of substrate, and enzymes in a 500-μl reaction volume. Enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 235 nm, corresponding to the loss of the C=C double bond of the substrate because the pyranose ring of the released ΔGlcA readily opens so that it is nonenzymatically converted to α-keto acid through the loss of the double bond (Fig. 1d) (7Linker A. Meyer K. Weissmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 213: 237-248Google Scholar, 9Hashimoto W. Kobayashi E. Nankai H. Sato N. Miya T. Kawai S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration was determined by UV spectrophotometry using theoretical molar extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 99,570 (m-1 cm-1). Enzyme purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The gellan lyase product (ΔGlcA-Glc-Rha-Glc) for the UGL substrate was prepared as described elsewhere (10Hashimoto W. Maesaka K. Sato N. Kimura S. Yamamoto K. Kumagai H. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 17-23Google Scholar). Hyaloronate lyase products (ΔGlcA-GlcNAc) and chondroitin lyase products (ΔGlcA-GalNAc) were obtained from Seikagaku Corporation (Tokyo, Japan). kcat and Km parameters were determined by nonlinear fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Crystallization and Structure Determination—UGL of Bacillus sp. GL1 is a monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of about 43 kDa (377 amino acid residues) (9Hashimoto W. Kobayashi E. Nankai H. Sato N. Miya T. Kawai S. Murata K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 368: 367-374Google Scholar). A UGL crystal (0.1 × 0.1 × 0.5 mm) was obtained by sitting-drop vapor diffusion as described elsewhere (21Mori S. Akao S. Miyake O. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 946-949Google Scholar). The space group was determined to be P6522 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 103.01 and c = 223.04 Å, and the solvent content was 69% assuming one molecule per asymmetric unit. Results of native data collection using synchrotron radiation at the BL-38B1 station of SPring-8 are summarized in Table I. The phase of the structure was solved by mir. Table II shows phasing statistics at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The protein model was built after solvent flattening with the PHASES program (23Furey W. Swaminathan S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 590-620Google Scholar) and refined by simulated annealing and the restrained least-squares method using CNS (25Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) (Table I). Quality of Refined Model—The refined model of UGL consists of 377 amino acid residues, and 478 water molecules, four glycine molecules, two DTT molecules, and one MPD molecule. The entire polypeptide chain sequence was well traced, and the electron densities of the main chain and side chain were generally very well defined in the 2 Fo - Fc map, except for N-terminal amino acid residue Met1 and C-terminal amino acid residue Arg377, whose electron density was too low for them to be identified completely. Other ligand molecules were also well fitted. The final overall R-factor for the refined model was 16.8%, with 63,316 unique reflections at a resolution of 25.0–1.8 Å. The final free R-factor was 18.9%. Final root mean square (r.m.s.) deviations from standard geometry were 0.005 Å for bond lengths and 1.22° for bond angles. Based on theoretical curves in the plot calculated according to Luzzati (33Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Google Scholar), the absolute positional error was estimated to be close to 0.17 Å at a resolution of 5.0–1.8 Å. Most (88.3%) nonglycine residues lie within most favored regions, and other residues (11.3%) within additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as defined in PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Ser345 (ϕ = 38°, Ψ = 65°), however, falls in generously allowed regions, exhibiting well defined density in the 2 Fo - Fc map and located in a sharp bend of the loop neighboring a helix. There are no residues in disallowed regions. Overall UGL Structure—The overall structure of UGL is shown as ribbon models (Fig. 2, a and b) and a molecular surface model (Fig. 2c). The enzyme is ∼45 × 45 × 40 Å and consists of an α6/α6-barrel structure with a deep pocket that is likely to be the active site (described below). Fig. 3 shows the UGL structure topology. The structure consists of 12 long α-helices (H1, 3–20; H2, 44–58; H3, 61–79; H4a, 89–94; H4b, 96–104; H5, 107–120; H6, 154–164; H7, 167–183; H8, 220–237; H9, 240–254; H10, 279–294; H11, 301–320; and H12, 351–366), 3 antiparallel β-sheets consisting of 2–3 strands and designated SA to SC (SA1, 24–28; SA2, 34–37; SB1, 124–125; SB2, 130–131; SC1, 145–147; SC2, 194–197; and SC3, 204–208), 2 short 310-helices (121–123 and 148–153) adjoining the long α-helices, and some loops. H4 has one additional residue, Leu95, whose oxygen atom has no hydrogen bond with the nitrogen atom of a paired residue. This α-helix (H4) was thus divided into two segments, H4a and H4b. The α-helix bends at this point, the angle being 30° between H4a and H4b. The α6/α6-barrel structure is formed by six outer helices (H1, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H11) running in roughly the same direction and six inner helices (H2, H4, H6, H8, H10, and H12) oriented in the opposite direction. These helices are connected, in a nearest neighbor and an up and down pattern by short and long loops. Loops between α-helices, such as H1 and H2, are referred to as L-H1:H2. One side of the barrel has short loops (L-H2:H3, L-H4:H5, L-H6:H7, L-H8:H9, 2 residues; and L-H10:H11, 6 residues). The other side, including the pocket, consists of long loops (L-H1:H2, 23 residues; L-H3:H4, 9 residues; L-H5:H6, 33 residues; L-H7:H8, 36 residues; L-H9:H10, 24 residues; and L-H11:H12, 30 residues). These long loops are packed together and form the wall of the deep funnel-shaped pocket roughly 15–20 Å in diameter at the lip and about 15 Å deep (Fig. 2c). This pocket is widely surrounded by aromatic residues.Fig. 3Topology of the fold in UGL. UGL includes an α6/α6-barrel. The 12 α-helices in the α6/α6-barrel are numbered from the N-terminal, H1 to H12, as in Fig. 2. Six boxes (H1, H3, H5, H7, H9, and H11) are outer α-helices facing the solvent. The other six boxes (H2, H4, H6, H8, H10, and H12) are inner α-helices. The 310-helix is also shown as boxes. The three short, antiparallel β-sheets, designated SA to SC, are shown as arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Structural Comparison—UGL consists of an α/α-toroidal fold. This basic fold is common in glycosyl hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, and terpenoid cylases/protein prenyltransferases in the SCOP data base (scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop/data/scop.b.b.bcj.html) (34Murzin A.Z. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Google Scholar). UGL has the α6/α6-barrel found in the six-hairpin enzyme superfamily of the SCOP data base, which includes glucoamylases (35Aleshin E.A. Golubev A. Firsov L.M. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) observed with the DALI (29Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) program, three proteins, i.e. hypothetical protein Yter from B. subtilis, glucoamylase from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (36Aleshin A.E. Feng P.-H. Honzatko R.B. Reilly P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 61-73Google Scholar), and AGE from the porcine kidney (41Itoh T. Mikami B. Maru I. Ohta Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 733-744Google Scholar), in the SCOP data base superfamily exhibited the highest degree of similarity. These proteins exhibited Z-scores of 32.7, 21.1, and 19.4. The r.m.s. distance was 2.80 Å for the superim-positioning of 323 Cα atoms of UGL on those of Yter, 3.50 Å for that of 287 Cα atoms of UGL on those of glucoamylase, and 3.30 Å for that of 278 Cα atoms of UGL on those of AGE, although they exhibit no amino acid sequence similarity and catalyze different types of reactions. UGL is an exo-hydrolase acting on unsaturated oligosaccharides produced by polysaccharide lyases, while Yter is a hypothetical protein of unknown function. The crystal structure of Yter determined by the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics has not, to the best of our knowledge, been published, although its coordinates are available in the RCSB Protein Data Bank. Glucoamylase is a polysaccharide exo-hydrolase found in some prokaryotic and many eukaryotic microorganisms. AGE has the α6/α6-barrel structure we determined, and catalyzes the epimeric reaction for N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and N-acetyl-d-mannosamine (41Itoh T. Mikami B. Maru I. Ohta Y. Hashimoto W. Murata K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 733-744Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the superimpositioning of UGL on Yter; their structures show the best fit overall. The 12 helices of the α6/α6-barrel are very similar for UGL and Yter in position, direction, and angle, but significant differences exist between UGL and Yter in the loop structure. The L-H1:H2 loop of UGL is longer (23 residues) than that of Yter (13 residues). The L-H7:H8 loop of UGL protrudes from the wall to the outside, while that of Yter is directed into the pocket. L-H11:H12 of UGL makes the pocket open wide, while that of Yter makes the pocket closed. Ligands in the Active Site—The UGL structure contains four glycine molecules (Gly401, 402, 403, 404), two DTT molecules (DTT501, 502), and one MPD molecule (MPD601) (Fig. 2). These molecules were present in the crystallization medium (21Mori S. Akao S. Miyake O. Nankai H. Hashimoto W. Mikami B. Murata K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 946-949Google Scholar). Glycine molecules are bound on the surface mainly through ionic interactions. The positive-charged side chains of Arg221, Arg334, and Arg303 face the carboxyl groups of three Gly401, Gly402, and Gly404 molecules, and the negative-charged side chains of Asp149 and Asp60 face amino groups of two Gly401 and Gly403 molecules.

We have now developed an anti-TARP monoclonal antibody named TP1, and show that TARP protein is up-regulated by androgen in both LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cells. We used TP1 to determine the subcellular localization of TARP by Western blotting following subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry.

We also transfected a plasmid encoding TARP fused to green fluorescent protein into LNCaP, MDA-Pca-2b, and PC-3 cells and confirmed its specific mitochondrial localization in living cells. Fractionation of mitochondria shows that TARP is located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Immunohistochemistry using a human prostate cancer sample showed that TP1 reacted in a dot-like cytoplasmic pattern consistent with the presence of TARP in mitochondria. These data demonstrate that TARP is the first prostate-specific protein localizing in mitochondria and indicate that TARP, an androgen-regulated protein, may act on mitochondria to carry out its biological functions.

https://openalex.org/W1996818317,"Ribonucleotide reductases are a family of essential enzymes that catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and provide cells with precursors for DNA synthesis. The different classes of ribonucleotide reductase are distinguished based on quaternary structures and enzyme activation mechanisms, but the components harboring the active site region in each class are evolutionarily related. With a few exceptions, ribonucleotide reductases are allosterically regulated by nucleoside triphosphates (ATP and dNTPs). We have used the surface plasmon resonance technique to study how allosteric effects govern the strength of quaternary interactions in the class Ia ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, which like all class I enzymes has a tetrameric α2 β2 structure. The component α2called R1 harbors the active site and two types of binding sites for allosteric effector nucleotides, whereas the β2 component called R2 harbors the tyrosyl radical necessary for catalysis. Our results show that only the known allosteric effector nucleotides, but not non-interacting nucleotides, promote a specific interaction between R1 and R2. Interestingly, the presence of substrate together with allosteric effector nucleotide strengthens the complex 2–3 times with a similar free energy change as the mutual allosteric effects of substrate and effector nucleotide binding to protein R1 in solution experiments. The dual allosteric effects of dATP as positive allosteric effector at low concentrations and as negative allosteric effector at high concentrations coincided with an almost 100-fold stronger R1-R2 interaction. Based on the experimental setup, we propose that the inhibition of enzyme activity in the E. coli class Ia enzyme occurs in a tight 1:1 complex of R1 and R2. Most intriguingly, we also discovered that thioredoxin, one of the physiological reductants of ribonucleotide reductases, enhances the R1-R2 interaction 4-fold.

The reaction is based on radical chemistry. A sophisticated allosteric regulation manifested by the binding of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and ATP allows the enzyme to coordinate a balanced production of precursors for DNA replication and repair. RNRs can be grouped into three different classes (1Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Google Scholar, 2Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Google Scholar, 3Eklund H.

The focus of this study is the class Ia RNR of Escherichia coli (the subgrouping of class I into Ia and Ib is based interalia on the presence or the absence of one of the two types of allosteric sites). All class I RNRs consist of two non-identical homodimeric components denoted R1 (or α2) and R2 (or β2). The active site region and the allosteric binding sites are located in the R1 component, whereas the radical required for catalysis is harbored by the R2 component. The three-dimensional structures are known for both components of E. coli class Ia RNR, protein R1 of 171 kDa and protein R2 of 87 kDa (3Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P.

Based on this knowledge on the known location of the interaction site between the R1 protein and a peptide mimicking the R2 C terminus and on symmetrical complementarities in the R1 and R2 structures, a quaternary structure for the holoenzyme was suggested (cf. Fig. 1) (5Uhlin U. Eklund H. Nature. 1994; 370: 533-539Google Scholar). The proposed quaternary structure offers a plausible mechanism for how the active site in R1 and the radical site in R2 may interact via long range radical transfer during catalysis (3Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Google Scholar, 10Sjöberg B.-M. Sahlin M. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. Nature Publishing Group, London2001Google Scholar, 11Stubbe J. Nocera D.G. Yee C.S. Chang M.C. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2167-2201Google Scholar). Whereas the active site in R1 is responsible for the actual reduction of the ribonucleoside diphosphate substrates, the allosteric regulatory sites are responsible for determining the substrate specificity and for switching on or off the enzyme activity. The allosteric regulation is controlled by two types of nucleotide binding sites denoted the “specificity” site and the “overall activity” site. Each R1 homodimer harbors two identical specificity sites at the homodimer interface and two identical overall activity sites at the N-terminal domains (12Eriksson M. Uhlin U. Ramaswamy S. Ekberg M. Regnström K. Sjöberg B.-M. Eklund H. Structure. 1997; 5: 1077-1092Google Scholar). The specificity sites can bind dTTP, dGTP, dATP, and ATP, whereas the overall activity sites only bind ATP and dATP. ATP is a positive effector when bound to the specificity site as well as to the overall activity site, whereas dATP has a positive regulatory role only when bound to the specificity site. When dATP is bound to the overall activity site (which has a 10 times lower affinity for dATP compared with the specificity site), it acts as a general negative effector and shuts down catalysis (13Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Google Scholar). When bound at the specificity site, ATP and dATP are preferentially promoting the reduction of CDP and UDP, dTTP promotes the reduction of all four substrates, and dGTP promotes the reduction of ADP and GDP (14Eriksson S. Sjöberg B.-M. Hervé G. Allosteric Enzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 189-215Google Scholar). In vivo, the enzyme may have both types of allosteric sites occupied by nucleotides with the effect that the physiological allosteric regulation of substrate specificity in the presence of ATP (at the overall activity site) is slightly different. ATP and dATP now promote the reduction of CDP and UDP, dTTP promotes the reduction of GDP (and ADP), and dGTP promotes the reduction of ADP (and GDP) (15Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 39-55Google Scholar). The allosteric regulation of most RNRs, including all of the eukaryotic RNRs, follows this general scheme (16Reichard P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 149-155Google Scholar). Several ultracentrifugation studies have demonstrated qualitatively that the allosteric effectors strengthen the E. coli R1-R2 holoenzyme complex (6Sjöberg B.-M. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9736-9743Google Scholar, 13Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 46: 25-38Google Scholar, 17Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4591-4601Google Scholar). The allosteric effects on a phage R1-R2 complex was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of T4-infected bacteria (18Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30999-31005Google Scholar). Climent et al. (7Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Google Scholar, 8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar) used enzyme activity measurements to quantitatively measure the dissociation constant of the E. coli R1-R2 holoenzyme. In the latter method, one component of the complex is treated as a substrate for the other component. It has the advantage that dissociation constants for complexes with one inactive component can be measured, provided that the inactive component is treated as a competitive inhibitor to the corresponding wild type component (8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar). This approach has been used in a number of studies to measure the dissociation constants for complexes involving one wild type and one mutant component (8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar, 19Larsson A. Climent I. Nordlund P. Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 58-63Google Scholar, 20Ekberg M. Sahlin M. Eriksson M.

However, the method is not useful to validate the separate influences of allosteric effectors and substrates on the dissociation constant of the R1-R2 complex. The surface plasmon resonance technique has been used to measure the influence of allosteric effectors on the dissociation constant of the mouse R1-R2 complex (24Rova U. Goodtzova K. Ingemarson R. Behravan G. Gräslund A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4267-4275Google Scholar, 25Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Google Scholar, 26Reichard P. Eliasson R. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33021-33026Google Scholar). The mouse enzyme shows positive cooperativity in the absence of allosteric effectors and stronger interaction without cooperativity in the presence of effector nucleotides. The highest affinity was observed in the presence of ATP or dATP. Combining these results with enzyme activity measurements and with the influence of nucleotide ligands on the molecular mass of the holoenzyme, Kashlan and Cooperman (27Kashlan O.B. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1696-1706Google Scholar) have suggested that the major active form of murine RNR consists of three R1 homodimers and three R2 homodimers. In this study, we have adopted the surface plasmon resonance technique (28Jönsson U. Fagerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I.

Nature. 1993; 361: 186-187Google Scholar) to study the influence of allosteric effectors, substrates, and combinations thereof on the interaction of the E. coli R1 and R2 proteins. This methodology has been used recently to study the strength of complexes formed between wild type E. coli R2 protein and E. coli R1 proteins with mutated overall activity sites (23Larsson Birgander P. Kasrayan A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14496-14501Google Scholar).

E. coli BL21(DE3) (B F– dcm ompT hsdS(rB–, mB–) gal λ(DE3)) obtained from Stratagene was used for overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase proteins. E. coli SK3981 used to produce thioredoxin (30Lunn C.A. Kathju S. Wallace B.J. Kushner S.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10469-10474Google Scholar) and E. coli A237/pPMR14 used to produce thioredoxin reductase (31Russel M. Model P. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 238-242Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. A. Holmgren (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). Design and Construction of Plasmids Encoding Hexahistidine-tagged Genes for E. coli Proteins R1 and R2—Plasmid pTB1 (32Åberg A. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Larsson A. Ormö M. Åhgren A. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12249-12252Google Scholar) containing the nrdA gene coding for protein R1 was used as template for insertion of the hexahistidine tag in R1. The six consecutive histidine codons were inserted in the N-terminal part of the nrdA gene between codons for Asn2 and Gln3. The oligonucleotide used for insertion was 5′-ATG AAT CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAG AAT-3′ where underlining denote the six histidine codons. Plasmid pTB2 (8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar) containing the nrdB gene coding for protein R2 was used as template for insertion of hexahistidine tags in R2. In one construct, the six consecutive histidine codons were inserted in the N-terminal part of the nrdB gene between codons for Ala2 and Tyr3. The oligonucleotide used for insertion was 5′-G GAC ACA CTC ATG GCA CACCACCACCACCACCAC TAT ACC ACC TTT TC-3′. In the other construct, the six consecutive histidine codons were inserted in the middle of the nrdB gene between codons for Asn179 and Gly180 (cf. Fig. 1). The oligonucleotide used for insertion was 5′-CCC ACA CCG TTA CACCACCACCACCACCAC ACG GTA AAA CTG TGA CCG-3′. Insertion of the hexahistidine tags was done according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by Stratagene. After mutagenesis, the complete mutagenized genes were sequenced. In each case, the presence of the six histidine codons was confirmed and no additional mutations were found. Expression and Purification of the Hexahistidine-tagged Proteins— The E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing a mutagenized pTB1 or pTB2 plasmid were grown in five flasks each with 1 liter of LB medium (total 5 liters of medium) with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The cultures were shaken vigorously (250 rpm) at 37 °C. When the cultures had grown in the exponential phase for at least 10 generations and reached an absorbance of A600 = 0.8, the expression of the cloned gene was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After ∼3 h of induction when the cultures reached the stationary phase at A600 = 2.1–2.4, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Cell pellets were frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cells were disintegrated in a X-press and resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Suspensions were spun at 19,000 rpm for 70 min, and supernatants were collected. Nucleic acids in the crude extracts were precipitated by the addition of neutralized streptomycin sulfate to a final concentration of 2%. After centrifugation, the supernatants were loaded at 5 ml/min on Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating nitrilotriacetic acid columns (5-ml bed volume, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm PMSF. Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed away with the equilibration buffer. The His-tagged protein then was eluted using a linear gradient of 20–200 mm imidazole in 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm PMSF. The purified His-tagged proteins were diluted ∼10 times and applied to a DEAE-fast-flow anion-exchange column to eliminate the imidazole and R2 heterodimers. Elutions were performed by a linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, and 10 μm PMSF for R1-His6 and in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, and 10 μm PMSF for R2-His6. Fractions containing His-tagged protein were concentrated under vacuum using collodium bags. The final yield was typically 20–25 mg of pure protein/g wet cells. The samples analyzed by SDS-PAGE were shown to be exceptionally pure (purity ≥ 90%). Determination of Protein Concentrations and Iron Content—Protein concentrations were determined using the absorbance at 280 nm minus the absorbance at 310 nm. The extinction coefficients (ϵ280–301) used were 180,000 m–1 cm–1 for protein R1 and R1-His6 and 120,000 m–1 cm–1 for proteins R2 and R2-His6. The stained SDS-PAGE gels were scanned in a Molecular Dynamics computing laser densitometer to calculate the purity of the protein preparations. Iron contents in R2 and R2-His6 were determined as described by Sahlin et al. (33Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Backes G. Loehr T. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 813-818Google Scholar). Determination of Enzyme Activity—Ribonucleotide reductase activity was determined either by the spectrophotometric assay measuring NADPH oxidation at 340 nm or by the [3H]CDP assay as described in Thelander et al. (34Thelander L. Sjöberg B.-M. Eriksson S. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 227-237Google Scholar). The spectrophotometric assay contained 0.06–0.1 μm R1 or R2 protein and 1 μm of the other component (R2 or R1, respectively) to give at least 10 times molar excess of the “helper” protein. Reaction mixtures contained 0.5 mm CDP, 1.5 mm ATP, 13 μm thioredoxin, 0.5 μm thioredoxin reductase, 0.4 mm NADPH, 11 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, and 33 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, in a final assay volume of 459 μl. A CDP concentration of 2.0 mm in combination with 15 mm Mg(CH3COO)2 was also used in a final assay volume of 486 μl with other inclusions as described above. One series of experiments contained either 100 μm dTTP or 100 μm dCTP as an allosteric effector and as substrate (1 mm CDP, UDP, GDP, or ADP). The [3H]CDP assay contained 0.1–0.03 μm R1 and 1 μm R2. Reaction mixtures contained 1.5 mm ATP, 13 μm thioredoxin, 0.5 μm thioredoxin reductase, 0.4 mm NADPH, 11 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, and 33 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, in a final volume of 50 μl, and the reaction was started by the addition of 0.5 mm [3H]CDP (with varying activity of 18,000–66,000 cpm/nmol). Determination of R1-R2 Complex Formation by Measuring Enzyme Activity—Interaction constants for the wild type or His-tagged R1-R2 complexes were determined by activity measurements using the [3H]CDP assay as described by Climent et al. (8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar). In these experiments, either the R1 or the R2 component is considered as substrate for the other respective component. The concentration of one component was held constant at 0.033 μm, and the concentration of the “substrate” component was varied between 0.033 and 4 μm. Standard reaction mixtures contained 100 μm dTTP, 1 mm [3H]CDP (18,000–66,000 cpm/nmol), 13 μm thioredoxin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 11 mm MgCl2, and 33 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, in a final assay volume of 50 μl. Variations included an exchange of dTTP for 1, 10, or 100 μm dATP, and in some assays, thioredoxin was excluded. For comparison, assays also were performed in conditions similar to those for the Biacore measurements (see below) with reaction mixtures also containing 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% P20 in addition to the ingredients given above. Vmax and KD values were obtained by direct curve fitting to the concentration of the variable component using the KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software) and Equation 1 from Climent et al. (7Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5164-5171Google Scholar). υ=Vmax⋅[KM+R2+R12R1−(KM+R2+R12R1)2−R2R1](Eq. 1) Nucleotide Binding Assay—The binding of dTTP and/or GDP to protein R1 was measured by the ultrafiltration assay (35Ormö M. Sjöberg B.-M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 138-141Google Scholar). The incubation mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm DTT, and different concentrations of substrate (5–500 μm [3H]GDP with or without 100–400 μm unlabeled dTTP) and effector (0.1–36 μm [3H]dTTP with or without 250 μm unlabeled GDP). Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis of R1-R2 Complex Formation— All of the surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using Biacore 1000 or Biacore 3000 equipped with research-grade CM5 sensor chips. The R1-His6 and R2-His6 protein ligands (173 and 88 kDa, respectively, and ≥90% pure based on SDS-PAGE) were immobilized using amine-coupling chemistry (36Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Google Scholar). The running buffer for the coupling step contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% P20. The flow cell surface was activated for 6 min by injection of a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.1 m 3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl-N-ethylcarbodiimide at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For coupling, concentrations of 0.1–0.4 mg/ml His-tagged protein in 50 mm KPO4, pH 5.6, were injected in a 2-min pulse and the surface was then blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0, to remove the loosely associated and non-covalently bound ligand. One flow cell was only activated/deactivated to serve as a reference surface. The coupling resulted in densities of 300–2000 RU of covalently bound protein ligand/flow cell (0.3–2 ng of protein/mm2). Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in running buffer plus 2 mm DTT. To collect kinetic binding data, the protein analyte (R1 or R2, 171 and 87 kDa, respectively, and ≥90% pure based on SDS-PAGE) in running buffer plus 2 mm DTT was injected over the flow cell at concentrations of 0–4 μm (for protein R1, in some cases, up to 10 μm) at a flow rate of 65 μl/min. The complex was allowed to reach equilibrium and associate/dissociate for 90 s followed by a dissociation time of 100–400 s. Prior to another injection of analyte, the surfaces were regenerated with a 30-s injection of 0.5 m KCl in the running buffer. Triplicates of each sample concentration (9–11 different concentrations between 0–4 and 0–10 μm protein) were injected in random order over the coupled surfaces as well as over the reference surface. Effector and/or substrate nucleotides were included in the running buffer as indicated in the different experiments. In one set of experiments, the running buffer included both the protein R1 analyte (0–10 μm) and 13 μm thioredoxin. Data were collected at a rate of 1 and 10 Hz and processed using the Bioeval 3.2 program to obtain RU values of bound R1 protein for each injection. Dissociation constants and R1-R2 stoichiometries were obtained by plotting bound R1 versus the concentration of injected R1 and direct curve fitting using the KaleidaGraph program. Properties of Hexahistidine-tagged Variants of E. coli Proteins R1 and R2—The aim of our binding studies was to investigate the protein-protein interaction in the E. coli class Ia ribonucleotide reductase holoenzyme complex in the presence of effector nucleotides and substrates. Earlier attempts to couple either protein R1 or protein R2 to Biacore membrane chips with a variety of different coupling chemistries were unsuccessful. 2I. Climent and B.-M. Sjöberg, unpublished data. Therefore, we decided to introduce a tag to each protein to facilitate coupling to the membranes. The interaction area between proteins R1 and R2 has not been identified experimentally but is strongly suggested based on symmetries in the separately solved crystal structures for the two components and on a number of biochemical data involving site-directed mutagenesis. Therefore, we sought to introduce the smallest possible tag to avoid disturbing the natural protein-protein interactions within the complex and to use parts of the polypeptide chains not likely to be involved in the holoenzyme interactions. We decided to introduce hexahistidine tags at the N termini of proteins R1 and R2, and in addition, we introduced a hexahistidine sequence into the middle of the R2 polypeptide at a position where the largely α-helical structure of R2 is interrupted by two consecutive β-strands (Fig. 1). This part of the structure forms a tip of the heart-shaped R2 structure and is considered to be opposite to the part of R2 that interacts with protein R1 in the enzymatically active holoenzyme complex (Fig. 1). The N-terminal hexahistidine addition to protein R1 and the internal hexahistidine addition to protein R2 resulted in proteins that behaved similarly to their respective wild type counterparts with regards to solubility and protein stability. However, the N-terminal hexahistidine addition to protein R2 gave a highly insoluble protein that eluded several refolding attempts and therefore could not be used for further studies. The N-terminal part of each R2 polypeptide chain interacts with the other polypeptide chain in the R2 homodimer, which may explain why this construct suffered from solubility and/or folding problems. The internal R2-His6 protein had a KD for interaction with R1 and a holoenzyme kcat that were similar to the KD and kcat of wild type R2 (Table I). The iron content of R2-His6 was lower than the theoretically expected value of 4, but this was also the case for the wild type R2 protein (Table I) and has been consistently found in many earlier studies (37Sjöberg B.-M. Structure Bond. 1997; 88: 139-173Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of R2-His6 and wild type R2 is comparable to the values published earlier (37Sjöberg B.-M. Structure Bond. 1997; 88: 139-173Google Scholar) as are their dissociation constants toward protein R1 as well (8Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Google Scholar). Also, the catalytic efficiency of the N-terminal R1-His6 protein and its dissociation constants toward protein R2 were similar to those of wild type R1 (data not shown).Table ICharacteristics of R2-His6 compared with wild type R2ProteinIron contentKDkcatmol/molμmmin-1R2 wild type2.9 ± 0.20.23 ± 0.04600 ± 35R2-His62.7 ± 0.20.21 ± 0.01549 ± 47 Open table in a new tab R1-R2 Interaction Studies by Surface Plasmon Resonance—We performed amine-based chemical coupling of each hexahistidine-tagged protein to CM5 membranes. Studies of R1-R2 protein interactions have to be performed in buffers where oxidation of protein R1 can be avoided and magnesium ions can be included. Therefore, it is not possible to use nitrilotriacetic acid membranes for coupling. Also, using membranes with hexahistidine-specific antibodies would require that all of the experiments be run anaerobically, which would impose additional complications. In initial studies, it turned out that R1-His6 coupled to the CM5 membrane did not bind any R2 protein and could not be used for protein interaction studies. One possible explanation is that the N-terminal domain of R1, which harbors the allosteric activity site, is involved in the formation of the R1-R2 holoenzyme complex (cf. Fig. 1). Other explanations may be that the R1 interaction surface was not exposed on the membrane or that R1 was inactivated by the coupling conditions. The internal R2-His6 protein was resistant to the coupling conditions (data not shown) and was consequently used for all of the subsequent studies on protein interactions between the ribonucleotide reductase components proteins R1 and R2. Initial Biacore binding experiments showed that there was a high background of unspecific binding of protein R1 to the CM5 membrane (activated and deactivated), even in the absence of coupled R2-His6. Similar problems have been observed previously in Biacore binding studies with the mammalian ribonucleotide reductase components (25Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8603-8609Google Scholar). In these la"
https://openalex.org/W2065569905,"The Pax3 protein has two DNA binding domains, a Paired domain (PD) and a paired-type Homeo domain (HD). Although the PD and HD can bind to cognate DNA sequences when expressed individually, genetic and biochemical data indicate that the two domains are functionally interdependent in intact Pax3. The mechanistic basis of this functional interdependence is unknown and was studied by protease sensitivity. Pax3 was modified by the creation of Factor Xa cleavage sites at discrete locations in the PD, the HD, and in the linker segment joining the PD and the HD (Xa172, Xa189, and Xa216) in individual Pax3 mutants. The effect of Factor Xa insertions on protein stability and on DNA binding by the PD and the HD was measured using specific target site sequences. Independent insertions at position 100 in the linker separating the first from the second helix-turn-helix motif of the PD and at position 216 immediately upstream of the HD were found to be readily accessible to Factor Xa cleavage. The effect of DNA binding by the PD or the HD on accessibility of Factor Xa sites inserted in the same or in the other domain was monitored and quantitated for multiple mutants bearing different numbers of Xa sites at each position. In general, DNA binding reduced accessibility of all sites, suggesting a more compact and less solvent-exposed structure of DNA-bound versus DNA-free Pax3. Results of dose response and time course experiments were consistent and showed that DNA binding by the PD not only caused a local structural change in the PD but also caused a conformational change in the HD (P3OPT binding to Xa216 mutants); similarly, DNA binding by the HD also caused a conformational change in the PD (P2 binding to Xa100 mutants). These results provide a structural basis for the functional interdependence of the two DNA binding domains of Pax3."
https://openalex.org/W2000156332,"CitS of Klebsiella pneumoniae is a secondary transporter that transports citrate in symport with 2 Na+ ions. Reaction of Cys-398 and Cys-414, which are located in a cytoplasmic loop of the protein that is believed to be involved in catalysis, with thiol reagents resulted in significant inhibition of uptake activity. The reactivity of the two residues was determined in single Cys mutants in different catalytic states of the transporter and from both sides of the membrane. The single Cys mutants were shown to have the same transport stoichiometry as wild type CitS, but the C398S mutation was responsible for a 10-fold loss of affinity for Na+. Both cysteine residues were accessible from the periplasmic as well as from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane by the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) suggesting that the residues are part of the translocation site. Binding of citrate to the outward facing binding site of the transporter resulted in partial protection against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, whereas binding to the inward facing binding site resulted in essentially complete protection. A 10-fold higher concentration of citrate was required at the cytoplasmic rather than at the periplasmic side of the membrane to promote protection. Only marginal effects of citrate binding were seen on reactivity with MTSET. Binding of Na+ at the periplasmic side of the transporter protected both Cys-398 and Cys-414 against reaction with the thiol reagents, whereas binding at the cytoplasmic side was less effective and discriminated between Cys-398 and Cys-414. A model is presented in which part of the cytoplasmic loop containing Cys-398 and Cys-414 folds back into the translocation pore as a pore-loop structure. The loop protrudes into the pore beyond the citrate-binding site that is situated at the membranecytoplasm interface. CitS of Klebsiella pneumoniae is a secondary transporter that transports citrate in symport with 2 Na+ ions. Reaction of Cys-398 and Cys-414, which are located in a cytoplasmic loop of the protein that is believed to be involved in catalysis, with thiol reagents resulted in significant inhibition of uptake activity. The reactivity of the two residues was determined in single Cys mutants in different catalytic states of the transporter and from both sides of the membrane. The single Cys mutants were shown to have the same transport stoichiometry as wild type CitS, but the C398S mutation was responsible for a 10-fold loss of affinity for Na+. Both cysteine residues were accessible from the periplasmic as well as from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane by the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) suggesting that the residues are part of the translocation site. Binding of citrate to the outward facing binding site of the transporter resulted in partial protection against inactivation by N-ethylmaleimide, whereas binding to the inward facing binding site resulted in essentially complete protection. A 10-fold higher concentration of citrate was required at the cytoplasmic rather than at the periplasmic side of the membrane to promote protection. Only marginal effects of citrate binding were seen on reactivity with MTSET. Binding of Na+ at the periplasmic side of the transporter protected both Cys-398 and Cys-414 against reaction with the thiol reagents, whereas binding at the cytoplasmic side was less effective and discriminated between Cys-398 and Cys-414.

The loop protrudes into the pore beyond the citrate-binding site that is situated at the membranecytoplasm interface. The secondary citrate transporter CitS of Klebsiella pneumoniae is a member of the bacterial 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter (2HCT) 1The abbreviations used are: 2HCT, 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter; TMS, transmembrane segment; RSO, right side out; ISO, insideout; PMS, phenazine methosulfate; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; AmdiS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide; FM, fluorescein 5-maleimide; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol. family. Members of the 2HCT family transport substrates that contain the 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif, as in citrate, malate, lactate, etc. (1Bandell M. Ansanay V. Rachidi N. Dequin S. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18140-18146Google Scholar). The family contains H+ and Na+ symporters that couple the translocation of the substrate to the co-ion as well as precursor/product exchangers that couple the uptake of the substrate to the excretion of a metabolic end product (2Poolman B. Molenaar D. Smid E.J. Ubbink T. Abee T. Renault P.P. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6030-6037Google Scholar, 3Lolkema J.S. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Konings W.N. Kaback H.R. Lolkema J.S. Handbook of Biophysics. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1996: 229-260Google Scholar). CitS is a Na+ symporter. It obligatorily couples the translocation of the divalent citrate anion (Hcit2–) to the translocation of two sodium ions and one proton (4Lolkema J.S. Enqeuist H. van der Rest M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 469-475Google Scholar, 5Pos K.M. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1018-1026Google Scholar). The CitS protein is an integral membrane protein containing 446 amino acid residues (47.5 kDa). The protein is believed to consist of a bundle of 11 hydrophobic transmembrane segments (TMSs) with the N and C terminus located in the cytoplasm and periplasm, respectively (Fig. 1) (6van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Google Scholar, 7van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29705-29711Google Scholar, 8van Geest M. Nilsson I. Von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Google Scholar, 9van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1466: 328-338Google Scholar). An additional hydrophobic segment, predicted to be transmembrane as well, was shown to reside in the periplasm between TMSs V and VI. The segment, termed Vb, and a stretch of about 40 residues in the C-terminal part of the protein (region Xa) are the two most conserved regions in the 2HCT family. Evidence is accumulating that region Xa is part of the translocation site in the protein. Conserved residue Arg-428 in TMS XI situated close to the membrane/cytoplasm interface is believed to bind one of the carboxylate groups of the substrate (10Bandell M. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13059-13067Google Scholar, 11Krom B.P. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 467-474Google Scholar). Recent crystal structures of the LacY and GlpT proteins, both secondary transporters from the major facilitator super-family, support the alternating access model for the translocation mechanism of secondary transporters (12Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Google Scholar, 13Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.-N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Google Scholar). In this model, the proteins contain single binding sites for substrate and co-ions that alternately are exposed to the two sides of the membrane during the catalytic cycle. Coupling between the co-ion and substrate fluxes is warranted by the condition that only the transporters with the free and with the fully occupied binding sites (“unloaded” and “fully loaded” states, respectively) can reorient the binding sites, whereas the conformational change is blocked when co-ion or substrate is bound. An important consequence of the alternating access model is that residues, which are part of the translocation site and which in topology models of the transporter reside in the membrane, are in contact with the water phase. In a number of recent studies this property was explored to identify (part of) the translocation site by identifying residues in transmembrane segments that were accessible to small water-soluble methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives by using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis (14Pirch T. Landmeier S. Jung H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42942-42949Google Scholar, 15Ding P.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1660: 106-117Google Scholar, 16Zhou Y. Bennett E.R. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13800-13808Google Scholar). A related consequence is that certain of these residues are expected to be accessible from both sides of the membrane when the protein can freely reorient the binding sites. Surprisingly, in a number of cases, this was observed for residues in loop regions, rather than TMSs, which let to the suggestion of pore-loop structures or re-entrant loops in secondary transporters (17Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Google Scholar, 18Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Google Scholar, 19Qiu Z.

Physiol. 2001; 117: 533-546Google Scholar). Pore-loop structures are loop regions that fold back between the TMSs and are commonly observed in channel proteins where they function as selectivity filters (23Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Hirai T. Walz T. Agre P. Heymann J.B. Engel A. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 2000; 407: 599-605Google Scholar, 24Doyle D.A. Cabral J.M. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbi J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar). Well studied examples are the bacterial and neuronal glutamate transporters, GltT and GLT-1, in which pore-loops were shown to play an important role in the translocation event (17Grunewald M. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9684-9689Google Scholar, 18Slotboom D.J. Sobczak I. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14282-14287Google Scholar, 25Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 246: 10775-10781Google Scholar, 26Grunewald M. Menaker D. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26074-26080Google Scholar). Pore-loop structures are not observed in the LacY and GlpT structures, and it is unknown whether or not they represent a different translocation mechanism. The CitS protein contains five cysteine residues, all located in the C-terminal part of the transporter. Cys-398 and Cys-414 are found in region Xa in the cytoplasmic loop between TMS X and TMS XI (Fig. 1). Recently, we showed that alkylation of the two cysteine residues by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) resulted in loss of activity, in line with the importance of region Xa in catalysis (27Sobczak I. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9789-9796Google Scholar). Most importantly, inactivation was also observed with the membrane-impermeable thiol reagent [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) added at the periplasmic side of the membrane revealing an access pathway for the reagent between the periplasm and the residues, possibly by formation of a pore-loop structure by the cytoplasmic loop. The access pathway was blocked in the presence of the co-ion Na+ indicating that the region is sensitive to translocation-linked conformational changes of the transporter. Here we study in detail the accessibility of Cys-398 and Cys-414 in single cysteine mutants of CitS in different catalytic states of the transporter. We probed the two cysteine residues by different sulfhydryl reagents and from both sides of the membrane. The catalytic state of the transporter was modulated through the presence and absence of citrate, Na+, or both. It follows that both positions are accessible from either side of the membrane and that the accessibility is different in the two orientations of the transporter. The results are consistent with a pore-loop structure formed by part of region Xa. Bacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and CitS Constructs—Escherichia coli strains DH5α and ECOMUT2 (28Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Google Scholar) were routinely grown in Luria Bertani broth (LB) medium at 37 °C under continuous shaking at 150 rpm. When appropriate, the antibiotics ampicillin and chloramphenicol were added at a final concentration of 50 and 30 μg/ml, respectively. All genetic manipulations were done in E. coli DH5α whereas the CitS protein was expressed in E. coli ECOMUT2 harboring plasmid pBADCitS and derivatives. Plasmid pBADCitS is based on vector pBAD24 (Invitrogen) and codes for the wild type CitS protein with an N-terminal His tag. Expression of the gene is under control of the arabinose promoter (27Sobczak I. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9789-9796Google Scholar). Expression of CitS was induced by adding 0.1% arabinose when the absorbance of the culture measured at 660 nm (A660) reached a value of 0.6. Cysteine mutants of CitS were constructed by PCR using the Quick-Change™ Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pHisCitS is based on the pBluescript vector (Stratagene) and was used as the template (7van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29705-29711Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced (Baseclear, Leiden, The Netherlands) to confirm the presence of the desired mutations and cloned into the pBAD24 vector as described before (27Sobczak I. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9789-9796Google Scholar). Preparation of Right Side Out and Inside Out Membrane Vesicles— E. coli ECOMUT2-expressing CitS variants were harvested from a 1-liter culture by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Right side out (RSO) membrane vesicles were prepared by the osmotic lysis procedure as described (29Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Google Scholar). Inside out (ISO) membranes were prepared by washing the cells once with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, followed by resuspending in 10 ml of 50 mm KPi buffer, pH 7, containing 2 mm MgSO4 and 10 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease. The suspension was passed once through a French press cell operated at 13,000 pounds/square inch. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in a Beckman SS34 rotor. Membranes were collected by ultracentrifugation for 25 min at 80,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100.4 rotor and washed once with 50 mm KPi, pH 7. RSO and ISO membranes were resuspended in low Na+ 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, rapidly frozen, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Membrane protein concentration was determined by the DC Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Partial Purification of CitS Using Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid Affinity Chromatography—ISO membranes (4 mg/ml) containing His-tagged CitS derivatives were solubilized in 50 mm KPi, pH 8, 400 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100. The solution was left on ice for 30 min. Undissolved material was removed by ultracentrifugation at 80,000 rpm for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (100-μl bed volume per 10 mg of protein), equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate pH 8.0, 600 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous shaking. After incubation, the resin was pelleted down by pulse centrifugation, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was washed with 10 volumes of equilibration buffer containing 300 mm KCl and 40 mm imidazole. The protein was eluted with 1 bed volume of the same washing buffer but containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 150 mm imidazole and stored at –20 °C. Transport Assay in RSO Membranes—Uptake was measured by the rapid filtration method. RSO membranes were energized using the potassium ascorbate/phenazine methosulfate (PMS) electron donor system (30Konings W.N. Barnes Jr., E.N. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5857-5861Google Scholar). Membranes were diluted to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml into 50 mm KPi, pH 6.0, containing 70 mm Na+ unless stated otherwise, in a total volume of 100 μl at 30 °C. Under a constant flow of water-saturated air, and while stirring magnetically, 10 mm potassium ascorbate and 100 μm PMS (final concentration) were added, and the proton motive force was allowed to develop for 2 min. Then, [1,5-14C]citrate (114 mCi/mmol Amersham Biosciences) was added to a final concentration of 4.4 μm. The uptake was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m LiCl, followed by immediate filtration over cellulose nitrate filters (0.45 μm, pore size). The filters were washed once with 2 ml of the 0.1 m LiCl solution and assayed for radioactivity. The background was estimated by adding the radiolabeled substrate to the vesicle suspension after the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold LiCl, immediately followed by filtering. When indicated, experiments were carried out in low Na+ KPi buffer that contains at most 0.005% of Na+, whereas standard KPi buffers may contain up to 0.3%. Treatment of RSO and ISO Membranes with Thiol Reagents—Stock solutions of NEM, MTSET, and AmdiS were prepared freshly in water. RSO membranes at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and ISO membranes at a concentration of 2 mg/ml were treated with the thiol reagents in 50 mm KPi, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. The treatment was stopped by addition of an equal concentration of DTT in case of NEM and AmdiS or reduced glutathione (GSH) in case of MTSET. The effect of Na+ on the treatment was measured by adding mixtures of NaCl and KCl yielding the same concentration of chloride. The effect of citrate on the treatment was measured by adding citrate from a 0.5 m stock solution adjusted to pH 6.0. After the treatment, RSO membranes were diluted twice into 50 mm KPi, pH 5.0. If necessary, NaCl and KCl were added to make the Na+ concentrations 70 mm. The resulting suspension was pH 6 and was immediately used to measure uptake activity. The presence of DTT or GSH did not affect the uptake rate in the control experiments. Following the treatment in the presence of citrate, the membranes were washed twice with 50 mm KPi, pH 6.0, by centrifugation for 20 min in a Beckman Optima™ TLX ultracentrifuge in a TLA100.2 rotor to remove citrate. Membranes were resuspended in 50 mm KPi, pH 6.0, containing 70 mm Na+ and assayed for uptake activity. Control experiment showed that the washing procedure resulted in a loss of 10–15% of the uptake activity. After the treatment of ISO membranes, CitS derivatives were partially purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described above and, subsequently, labeled with 0.1 mm fluorescein 5-maleimide (FM) in elution buffer for 5 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 0.5 mm DTT, and after addition of SDS sample buffer, 25-μl samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Fluorescence of proteins labeled with FM was visualized on a Lumi-Imager F1 imager (Roche Diagnostics) by irradiation with UV light using a 520-nm filter. All samples containing FM were kept out of bright light until the gel was exposed. After exposure, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to compare the protein levels of CitS. Quantification was done using the LumiAnalyst 3.1 software package supplied by Roche Diagnostics. Materials—2-(Trimethylammonium) ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) was purchased from Anatrace Inc. (Ohio). NEM was purchased from Sigma, and AMdiS and FM were purchased from Molecular Probes Europe BV (Leiden, The Netherlands). Low Na+ potassium buffer (KH2PO4) was purchased from Merck. Activity of Single Cysteine Mutants SSSCS and SSSSC— Wild type CitS transports citrate obligatorily coupled to the translocation of two Na+ ions (4Lolkema J.S. Enqeuist H. van der Rest M.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 469-475Google Scholar). The rate of uptake in RSO membranes prepared from E. coli cells expressing CitS and energized by the artificial electron donor system ascorbate/PMS increased sigmoidally with increasing Na+ concentration. Half of the maximal rate was obtained at a Na+ concentration of 3 mm (27Sobczak I. Lolkema J.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9789-9796Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, •). The shape of the curve was not significantly different for a mutant of CitS in which three out of the five endogenous cysteine residues were replaced by serines (mutant SSSCC, ○). In addition, removing Cys-414, located in the C-terminal loop of CitS (see Fig. 1), resulted in a slightly lower affinity for Na+ (mutant SSSCS, ▾) without affecting the shape of the curve (Fig. 2, inset). Half of the maximal rate was obtained at a concentration of 6 mm Na+. The low residual uptake rate observed in the absence of added Na+ (about 2% of the saturated rate; Fig. 2, inset) is due to low Na+ ion contaminations of the buffer system. A more drastic change in affinity was observed when in addition to the three N-terminal cysteine residues, Cys-398 was replaced by serine (mutant SSSSC, Fig. 2, ▿). The apparent affinity for Na+ dropped to 28 mm, and again, the sigmoidal increase of the rate with the Na+ concentration was retained. A similar reduction in affinity for Na+ was observed for the Cys-less mutant (SSSSS, Fig. 2, ▪) suggesting that the C398S mutation in the SSSSC and SSSSS mutants was responsible for the observed effect. The small difference in affinity between the SSSSC and SSSSS mutants is consistent with the observed difference between the SSSCC and SSSCS mutants and suggests that the C414S mutation lowers the affinity for Na+ independently of the effect of the C398S mutation. Finally, in the single cysteine mutants SSSCS and SSSSC, the mechanism of citrate translocation is the same as observed for wild type CitS. Uptake is strictly coupled to the uptake of Na+, and two Na+ are required for one translocation cycle. Accessibility of Cys-398 and Cys-414 in the Unloaded State of the Transporter—Treatment of RSO membrane vesicles containing CitS mutant SSSCS with the membrane-permeable maleimide NEM at a concentration of 2 mm for increasing periods of time resulted in inhibition of the initial rate of citrate uptake down to a residual activity of about 10% (Fig. 3A, •). The half-time of inactivation was 8 min. Treatment of the same membranes with the membrane-impermeable and more bulky maleimide 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AmdiS) did not result in significant inactivation under the same conditions (Fig. 3A, ○). In contrast, the membrane-impermeable but much smaller methanethiosulfonate MTSET was very efficient in inactivating the SSSCS mutant. At the same concentration, the half-time of inactivation was about 10 times shorter for MTSET than observed for NEM (Fig. 3A, ▾). It should be noted that the reagents only had a marginal effect on the uptake activity of RSO membrane vesicles containing the Cys-less CitS mutant SSSSS (Fig. 3C). Qualitatively, the results were the same for the reactivity of Cys-414 in mutant SSSSC (Fig. 3B). Both NEM and MTSET inactivated the transporter, whereas AmdiS did not. Quantitatively, the rates of inactivation were much faster than observed for the SSSCS mutant, with half-times below 20 s at concentrations of the thiol reagents that were lower than used to inactivate SSSCS. Both mutants showed a residual activity between 10 and 20% after reaction with NEM and MTSET. It follows that Cys-398 and Cys-414 are both accessible to NEM and MTSET added at the periplasmic side of the membrane. The different rates of reaction may reflect differences in accessibility, different reactivities of the two thiols, or both. Membrane vesicles with an inverted orientation (inside out, ISO) were used to determine the accessibility of Cys-398 and Cys-414 with thiol reagents NEM, AmdiS, and MTSET from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Mutants SSSCS and SSSSC purified from ISO membranes in detergent solution were visualized by labeling of the single cysteine residues with the fluorescent maleimide FM, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence imaging of the gel (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 1). No fluorescent protein band was observed for the Cys-less CitS (SSSSS; Fig. 4C). Pretreatment of purified SSSCS and SSSSC with NEM (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 3), AmdiS (lanes 5), and MTSET (lanes 7) prevented subsequent labeling with FM, showing that all molecules were accessible to the reagents in the solubilized state. Treatment of ISO membranes containing the SSSCS or SSSSC mutants before purification with 2 mm NEM for 20 min (SSSCS) or 0.5 mm NEM for 5 min (SSSSC) under the same conditions as the RSO membranes above resulted in a >90% decrease of the labeling with FM after purification of the proteins (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2). As expected, membrane-permeable NEM was equally capable of reacting with both cysteine residues in RSO and ISO membranes. Remarkably, treatment of the membranes with 0.25 mm AmdiS for 20 (SSSCS) or 5 min (SSSSC) significantly reduced labeling with FM indicating that, in contrast to RSO membranes, in ISO membranes Cys-398 and Cys-414 are accessible to AmdiS (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 4). Treatment of the ISO membranes containing SSSCS and SSSSC with MTSET at a concentration and for a time that resulted in 90% inhibition in RSO vesicles almost completely blocked further labeling with FM (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 6), showing that MTSET accesses the cysteine residues in both RSO and ISO membranes. In conclusion, in the unloaded state of the transporter, i.e. in the absence of citrate and Na+, both cysteine residues in region Xa of CitS are accessible from the periplasmic as well as the cytoplasmic side of the membrane for membrane-permeable NEM and membrane-impermeable MTSET. Access for the more bulky, impermeable AmdiS is restricted from the periplasmic side but not from the cytoplasmic side. Accessibility of Cys-398 and Cys-414 in the Citrate-bound State of the Transporter—In RSO membranes, containing the SSSCS mutant the presence of citrate resulted in partial protection of CitS against NEM inactivation (Fig. 5A). The membranes were treated with 2 mm of NEM for 20 min, which just about resulted in maximal inactivation in the absence of citrate (see Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, the residual activity increased from 14% in the absence of citrate to 38% at 50 mm citrate. The lack of change in residual activity above citrate concentrations of 10 mm indicated that the thiol did react with NEM in the citrate-bound state but at a slower rate than in the free state. A concentration of citrate below 1 mm was enough to give half of the maximal difference in residual activity. The experiment shows that CitS binds citrate and that Cys-398 is accessible to NEM both in the free and in the citrate-bound state. In ISO membranes, using the same concentration of NEM for the same amount of time, the presence of up to 5 mm citrate had little effect on the labeling by NEM (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 5, and 6). However, at 50 mm citrate significant inhibition of NEM labeling was observed. Quantification of the fluorescence intensity showed that the residual free thiols after NEM treatment at 50 mm citrate amounted up to 80% and that the concentration to obtain half of the maximal protection was between 5 and 50 mm (Fig. 5B), which is at least 10 times higher than observed for the RSO membranes. The latter is explained by a higher reactivity of the thiol or a lower affinity for citrate at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane as compared with the periplasmic side. At any rate, citrate protects Cys-398 more efficiently in the inward facing than in the outward facing binding site. The presence of citrate had small but significant effects on the reaction of Cys-398 with membrane-impermeable MTSET. In RSO membranes, the residual activity after treatment with 2 mm MTSET for 5 min increased from 21 to 36% when 50 mm citrate was present during the treatment (Table I). After the same treatment of ISO membranes in the presence of increasing concentrations of citrate, the percentage of free thiols changed from 13 to 28% (Fig. 6A, lanes 2, 5, and 7; Table I). Apparently, in the citrate-bound state, the accessibility of Cys-398 in the SSSCS mutant for MTSET was only marginally affected in either orientation of the transporter. Similarly, only small effects were observed on the accessibility of Cys-414 in the SSSSC mutant. In RSO membranes, no significant effect on the residual activity in the presence of citrate was observed, both against NEM and against MTSET (Table I), whereas in ISO membranes the protection was minimal (Table I and Fig. 6B, lanes 2, 5, and 6).

https://openalex.org/W1965285551,"Protein kinases phosphorylate the appropriate protein substrate by recognizing residues both proximal and distal to the site of phosphorylation. Although these distal contacts may provide excellent binding affinities (low Km values) through stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex, these contacts could reduce catalytic turnover (decrease kcat) through slow phosphoprotein release. To investigate how protein kinases can overcome this problem and maintain both high substrate affinities and high turnover rates, the phosphorylation of the yeast RNA transport protein Npl3 by its natural protein kinase, Sky1p, was evaluated. Sky1p bound and phosphorylated Npl3 with a Km that was 2 orders of magnitude lower than a short peptide mimic representing the phosphorylation site and only proximal determinants. Surprisingly, this extraordinary difference is not the result of high affinity Npl3 binding. Rather, Npl3 achieves a low Km through a rapid and favorable phosphoryl transfer step. This step serves as a chemical clamp that locks the protein substrate in the active site without unduly stabilizing the product phosphoprotein and slowing its release. The chemical clamping mechanism offers an efficient means whereby a protein kinase can simultaneously achieve both high turnover and good substrate binding properties.

The phosphorylation of hydroxyl-containing amino acids (i.e. serine, threonine, and tyrosine) in eukaryotic proteins controls numerous physiological responses essential for cell function. The enzymes that catalyze this modification, the protein kinases, have been studied for their critical role in complex signaling cascades and for their potential as valuable chemotherapeutic targets in proliferative diseases (1Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5001-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 2Fabbro D. Ruetz S. Buchdunger E. Cowan-Jacob S.W. Fendrich G. Liebetanz J. Mestan J. O'Reilly T. Traxler P.

Although much is known about the protein kinase family on the structural and functional levels (3Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 4Taylor S.S.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2568) Google Scholar), less is known about the interactions of these enzymes with their physiological protein substrates. Protein kinases recognize and phosphorylate short peptide segments (consensus sequences) of 4–10 residues based on the known phosphorylation sequences of their targets (7Kemp B.E. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 8Kemp B.E. Graves D.J. Benjamini E. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Although these short segments (consensus sequences) are minimal substrates, they do not provide all the binding energy offered by the full-length protein substrate. For instance, the catalytic efficiency of phosphorylating the protein substrate MAPKAP2 using p38 MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MANT-ADP, ADP with an N-methylanthraniloyl group attached to the ribose ring.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; MANT-ADP, ADP with an N-methylanthraniloyl group attached to the ribose ring. is ∼2 orders of magnitude higher than that for a 14-residue peptide based on the consensus sequence (10Hawkins J. Zheng S. Frantz B. LoGrasso P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 310-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In another example, Csk phosphorylates the protein substrate Lck >3 orders of magnitude more efficiently than a 9-residue peptide based on the phosphorylation site (11Sondhi D. Xu W. Songyang Z. Eck M.J. Cole P.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Studies of this type support a model in which regions beyond the limited consensus sequence interact with the protein kinase scaffold and govern high efficiency protein phosphorylation. Although an x-ray structure for a protein kinase with a full-length protein substrate bound is currently unavailable, structural and functional studies are now beginning to reveal the nature of the interacting surfaces between the enzyme and substrate. Residues important for recognition on the substrate may, in fact, be very far from the site of phosphorylation. Several transcription factors (e.g. c-Jun, activating transcription factor-2, and myocyte enhancer factor-2A) regulated by MAPK phosphorylation interact with the enzyme using contacts as far as 100 residues away from the site of modification (12Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Kallunki T. Deng T. Hibi M. Karin M. Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Advances toward defining the regions of the kinase that interact with the protein substrates have also been made. Crystal structures of MAPK with docking peptides based on the distal interacting residues in myocyte enhancer factor-2A show that the large lobe of the kinase domain offers residues not in the active site that recognize the substrate (14Chang C.I. Xu B.E. Akella R. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1241-1249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the high affinity interaction between Csk and its substrate Src relies on a specific docking region in helix αD of the kinase domain, a secondary structural element outside the catalytic cleft (15Lee S. Lin X. Nam N.H. Parang K. Sun G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14707-14712Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although these examples highlight discrete surfaces within the kinase domain, other studies reveal that substrate-binding sites can lie on non-catalytic regulatory proteins. Cdk2 recognizes substrates containing an RXL motif that binds not to the kinase domain, but rather to a conserved region in the regulatory cyclin A3, ∼40 Å away from the active site (16Brown N.R. Noble M.E. Endicott J.A. Johnson L.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 17Schulman B.A. Lindstrom D.L. Harlow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10453-10458Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although such studies have begun to unravel some of the mysteries regarding protein kinase substrate recognition, it is not clear how these distal surface patches impact catalysis in the active site. Although the protein kinases have been well studied for the last half-century, only recently have powerful, fast mixing kinetic methods been applied to understand the mechanism of protein phosphorylation (18Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12072-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These methods have uniquely contributed by establishing a general pathway for substrate turnover where release of the product (ADP) limits net phosphorylation under steady-state conditions (3Adams J.A. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2271-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). However, these studies have been performed using short consensus sequence peptides that may not possess the conformational properties and full range of ground state contacts available in the full-length protein substrates. Although pre-steady-state kinetic investigations of protein phosphorylation have been reported in two cases, thus far, key features regarding the interaction of the protein target and enzyme have not been explored (22Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Vu D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Waas W.F. Rainey M.A. Szafranska A.E. Dalby K.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12273-12286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Given the observation that protein substrates tend to have lower Km values than peptide mimics, it is possible that the current mechanism based on short peptides may differ with real physiological substrates. To investigate this possibility, we explored the kinetic mechanism of Sky1p, a yeast SR protein kinase using a physiological substrate, Npl3 (nuclear protein localization-3) (24Siebel C.W. Feng L. Guthrie C. Fu X.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5440-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Npl3 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm in yeast, transporting mRNA for translation (25Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This translocation requires phosphorylation of Npl3 at a single site in the C terminus by Sky1p (22Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Vu D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Gilbert W. Siebel C.W. Guthrie C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 302-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the Km for Npl3 is ∼2 orders of magnitude lower than that for the corresponding consensus sequence peptide, the rate-limiting step for protein phosphorylation is still ADP release. Surprisingly, Sky1p does not exploit added contacts in the enzyme-substrate complex for good affinity binding (Km < Kd), but rather recruits these interactions to support a fast and favorable phosphoryl transfer step. Using this strategy, the phosphoryl transfer step functions as a chemical clamp that provides exquisite selectivity, but avoids the dilemma of over-stabilizing the phosphoproduct and limiting the catalytic cycle through slow phosphoprotein release. Materials—ATP, ADP, Mops, MgCl2, KCl, acetic acid, sucrose, DE52 resin, and liquid scintillant were obtained from Fisher. MANT-ADP was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Poly-prep chromatography columns were obtained from Bio-Rad. The synthetic peptide YRTRDAPRERSPTR was obtained from the Peptide and Oligonucleotide Facility at the University of Southern California. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Expression and Purification of Proteins—Sky1p lacking the N terminus and spacer insert (Sky1pΔNS) and Npl3 were expressed and purified using previously published protocols (22Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Vu D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Plasmid pET15b containing Npl3 with a Ser411 → Thr mutation (Thr-Npl3) was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) RP cells (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 2 liters of LB broth containing 200 μg/ml ampicillin to A600 = 0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 12 h at 22 °C. Cells were resuspended in 100 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and lysed by sonication. The crude lysate was spun at 15,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed with lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole and eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluent was diluted to 100 mm NaCl and loaded onto a Q-Sepharose fast flow column. The column was washed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. The protein was eluted with a 100–500 mm NaCl gradient. The fractions containing Thr-Npl3 were pooled, and the NaCl concentration was increased to 1 m. After concentration in a Centriprep 30 concentrator (Millipore Corp.), the protein was filtered through a 0.22-μm low bind syringe filter and loaded onto a Superdex 200 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Pooled fractions were concentrated and flash-frozen. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (26Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic parameters for Sky1pΔNS were determined using Npl3 and Thr-Npl3 proteins as substrates in the presence of 50 mm Mops (pH 7.0), 4 mm free Mg2+, and 600–1000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP unless stated otherwise. Assays were typically executed by pre-equilibrating the enzyme, MgCl2, and ATP for 2 min and then initiating the reaction by the addition of protein substrate at 23 °C. Generation of the phosphoproduct was measured at various quench times using fixed concentrations of substrate. The reaction mixtures (20 μl) were quenched with 180 μl of 30% acetic acid. A portion of each reaction (180 μl) was then applied to DE52 columns (3 ml of resin) and washed with 5 ml of 30% acetic acid. The collected flow-through fraction containing phosphorylated substrate was then counted on the 32P channel in liquid scintillant. Control experiments were performed to determine the background phosphorylation (i.e. phosphorylation of Npl3 or the peptide substrate in the presence of quench). The specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP was determined by measuring the total counts of the reaction mixture. The time-dependent concentration of phosphorylated Npl3 and peptide substrate was then determined by considering the total counts/min of the flow-through fraction, the specific activity of the reaction mixture, and the background phosphorylation. For steady-state kinetic measurements, product formation is linear with time, and <5% of the substrate was converted to product. Viscosity Studies—The steady-state phosphorylation of the peptide substrate and Npl3 was monitored using the column assay as described above in the absence and presence of 30% sucrose. The relative solvent viscosity (ηrel) of the buffer (50 mm Mops (pH 7)) containing sucrose was measured using an Ostwald viscometer and a previously published protocol (27Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). A ηrel of 2.4 was measured for the buffer containing 30% sucrose at 23 °C. Inhibition Assays—Inhibition studies using Thr-Npl3 were carried out by pre-equilibrating the enzyme, MgCl2, and ATP for 2 min and then initiating the reaction by the addition of Npl3 (4 μm) in the presence of Thr-Npl3 (0–52.5 μm). Inhibition studies using phospho-Npl3 were carried out by generating various amounts of phospho-Npl3 by completely turning over known amounts of Npl3 in the presence of enzyme, MgCl2, and ATP in 50 mm Mops (pH 7.0). The degree of inhibition at various phospho-Npl3 concentrations (0–50 μm) was then measured by the addition of exogenous Npl3. Reactions were processed and analyzed as described above. Rapid Quench Flow Experiments—The phosphorylation of Npl3 and the peptide substrate was monitored using a Model RGF-3 quench flow apparatus (KinTek Corp.) following a previously published procedure (18Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Rapid quench flow experiments were typically executed by loading equal volumes of enzyme, buffer, and MgCl2 into one sample loop and substrate, [γ-32P]ATP (600–1000 cpm/pmol), and MgCl2 in 50 mm Mops (pH 7) into the other. The reactions were quenched using 30% acetic acid, and the phosphoproduct was separated from unreacted [32P]ATP using the column separation assay. Control experiments were performed to determine the background phosphorylation (i.e. phosphorylation of substrate in the presence of quench) using previously published protocols (18Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The time-dependent concentration of phosphoproduct was then determined by considering the total counts/min of the flow-through fraction, the specific activity of the reaction mixture, and the background phosphorylation. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Experiments—All transient state fluorescence studies were performed using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrometer. In the trapping experiments, Sky1pΔNS, MANT-ADP, and MgCl2 in 50 mm Mops (pH 7) were pre-equilibrated in one 2.5-ml syringe and then mixed at a 1:1 ratio with ADP and MgCl2 in 50 mm Mops (pH 7) in a second 2.5-ml syringe. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and emission was measured using a 410-nm cut-on filter fitted between the cell and the photomultiplier tube. For data analysis, an average of five to eight individual traces was recorded, and the data were fit to double exponential functions. Data Analysis—The initial velocity versus substrate concentration data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to obtain kcat and Km values for Npl3 and peptide substrate phosphorylation. The production of phospho-Npl3 in the rapid quench flow experiments was fit to Equation 1,[P]=α×(1−exp(−kbt))+L×t(Eq. 1) where [P] is the concentration of phospho-Npl3, α is the amplitude of the “burst” phase, kb is the burst phase rate constant, L is the linear rate, and t is time. The data generated from the catalytic trapping experiments were fit using the kinetic simulation program KINSIM (28Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—To investigate the kinetic properties of Sky1p, a truncated form of the enzyme lacking the N terminus and an insert sequence (Sky1pΔNS) was expressed. Sky1pΔNS can be expressed in large pure amounts possessing the same activity and the same Km for ATP as the full-length enzyme (22Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Vu D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 29Nolen B. Yun C.Y. Wong C.F. McCammon J.A. Fu X.D. Ghosh G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters for Sky1pΔNS were measured using either Npl3 or a peptide substrate based on the single phosphorylation site in the C terminus of Npl3 (YRTRDAPRERSPTR). Initial velocities were measured using fixed concentrations of [32P]ATP (2 mm) and varying concentrations of Npl3 (1–40 μm) or peptide (0.1–3mm) in the presence of 4 mm free Mg2+. The kcat, Km, and kcat/Km values for Npl3 phosphorylation are 0.6 ± 0.1 s—1, 3.5 ± 0.5 μm, and 0.17 ± 0.04 μm—1 s—1, respectively. The kcat and Km values for peptide phosphorylation are 1.0 ± 0.2 s—1 and 600 ± 100 μm, respectively. Thus, the kcat/Km for Npl3 is ∼100-fold larger than that for the short peptide. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—In a previous study (22Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Vu D. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we showed that the phosphorylation of Npl3 by Sky1pΔNS leads to classic burst kinetics, indicating that the phosphoryl transfer step does not limit substrate turnover. To investigate the role of distal protein segments in controlling the phosphoryl transfer step, we employed rapid quench flow methods to measure the pre-steady-state kinetics of peptide phosphorylation. In this experiment, Sky1pΔNS (15 μm) was pre-equilibrated with [32P]ATP (2 mm) and then rapidly mixed with peptide substrate (3 mm) in the rapid quench flow instrument. As shown in Fig. 1, the production of the phosphopeptide proceeded in a linear manner, with no evidence of a burst phase in the early portion of the reaction. In these experiments, very high enzyme concentrations (15 μm) were used to maximize the chances of detecting a burst phase. No clear evidence for an appreciable lag in the generation of the phosphopeptide was detected in the early portion of the reaction. Accordingly, the data were fit to a linear function to obtain an initial velocity of 15 μm/s (v/[E] = 1 s—1), a value consistent with the steady-state kinetic parameters for this substrate. The concentrations of ATP and peptide were ∼3- and 5-fold above their Km values, so the absence of a burst amplitude was not due to low substrate saturation. In comparison, the phosphorylation of Npl3 (10 μm) by Sky1pΔNS (1 μm) was accompanied by a rapid large burst phase (kb = 33 ± 6 s—1 and α/[E] = 0.75 ± 0.10 μm), followed by a linear steadystate phase (L/[E] = 0.42 ± 0.04 s—1). These findings imply that the rate of phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting for peptide phosphorylation, whereas this step is fast for Npl3. The pre-steady-state kinetic studies suggested that a slow phosphoryl transfer step limits peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 1). To provide further support for this conclusion, the effects of solvent viscosity on the steady-state kinetic parameters for peptide phosphorylation were measured. We have shown previously that kcat for a good substrate displays a large viscosity effect due to rate-limiting bimolecular product release (27Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although product release is governed by a first-order rate constant, it is a diffusive process and thus is sensitive to solvent viscosity (30Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 31Caldwell S.R. Newcomb J.R. Schlecht K.A. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7438-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In comparison, the kcat for a poor substrate is insensitive to solution viscosity changes due to the slow unimolecular phosphoryl transfer step (27Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The initial velocity for the Sky1pΔNS reaction was measured as a function of peptide concentration in the presence and absence of 30% sucrose (Fig. 2). The added viscosogen had no effect on kcat, implying that the rate-limiting step in peptide turnover is a unimolecular step, viz. the phosphoryl transfer step. Furthermore, the absence of a viscosity effect implies that the viscous agent does not alter protein structure. As an additional control, the phosphorylation of Npl3 was also monitored at 0 and 30% sucrose (Fig. 2, inset). The observed decrease in kcat, measured as a ratio of the parameter in the absence and presence of sucrose (kcat(o)/kcat = 2.6), is similar in value to the change in solvent viscosity (ηrel = 2.4). These data imply that Npl3 turnover is limited by a diffusive step. Thus, the viscosity studies indicate that the absence of a burst phase for the peptide is due to rate-limiting phosphoryl transfer. Although a large burst phase and a large viscosity effect on kcat for Npl3 (Figs. 1 and 2) indicate that the phosphoryl transfer step is fast, these results do not provide information as to which product release step (ADP or phospho-Npl3) limits turnover. Although ADP dissociation limits peptide phosphorylation in several protein kinases (19Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Shaffer J. Sun G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11149-11155Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Jan A.Y. Johnson E.F. Diamonti A.J. Carraway I.K. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9786-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the presence of a real physiological protein substrate could change this rate-limiting step. To address this question, a catalytic trapping protocol originally developed in our laboratory for protein kinase A was employed (19Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15733-15738Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 21Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12072-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this method, shown in Scheme 1, Sky1pΔNS is pre-equilibrated with ADP prior to reaction initiation with excess amounts of ATP in the rapid quench flow instrument. In the absence of ADP preequilibration, Npl3 was phosphorylated in a typical biphasic manner consistent with classic burst kinetics (Fig. 3). However, pre-equilibration of Sky1pΔNS with ADP abolished the burst phase without altering the magnitude of the steady-state linear phase. These findings indicate that ATP is an effective catalytic trapping agent. The kinetic transients in Fig. 3 were modeled using a numerical integration program (28Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and the simple kinetic mechanism in Scheme 1. The kinetic trace in the absence of ADP is simulated to obtain a set of rate constants that satisfy the burst kinetics (see legend to Fig. 3). Using this fixed set of rate constants, the trace in the presence of ADP is then modeled to provide a visual fit to the data with only one variable, koff. The simulated data best approximate the experimental data when koff (0.5 s—1) is close in value to kcat (0.6 s—1). Thus, the catalytic trapping studies demonstrated that phospho-Npl3 is released quickly from the active site in the steadystate time frame and that the rate-limiting step in kcat is cleanly ADP release.Fig. 3Catalytic trapping experiment. Sky1pΔNS was mixed with Npl3 and ATP in the absence (•) and presence (○) of pre-equilibrated ADP (400 μm). The final concentrations of Sky1pΔNS, ATP, and Npl3 after mixing were 1.1 μm, 3 mm, and 12 μm, respectively. The data in the absence of ADP were modeled using KINSIM (28Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and the following rate constants in Scheme 1: k1 = 1 μm—1 s—1, k—1 = 5000 s—1, k3 = 120 s—, and k4 = 0.6 s—1. The data in the presence of ADP were modeled using these rate constants and koff = 0.5 s—1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To provide further evidence that ADP release limits the k4 step in Scheme 1, the dissociation rate constant for a fluorescent derivative of ADP, MANT-ADP, was measured using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. We showed previously that MANT-ADP binding can be monitored by direct fluorescence enhancements of the methylanthraniloyl group at 440 nm (35Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Shaffer J. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12813-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fluorescent tag does not appear to alter significantly nucleotide affinity since the Kd for MANT-ADP (13 μm) is close in value to that for ADP (43 μm) (35Aubol B.E. Nolen B. Shaffer J. Ghosh G. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12813-12820Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Given these observations, we measured the dissociation rate constant for MANT-ADP as a surrogate for ADP release using a trapping experiment. Sky1pΔNS was saturated with MANT-ADP in one syringe (400 μm, 30 × Kd) and then mixed with a large excess of ADP in the second syringe (4 mm). The fluorescence data were well fit by a double exponential transient with rate constants of 14 and 0.7 s—1 (Fig. 4). Increasing the concentration of trapping ligand or MANT-ADP by 50% did not alter these rate fits, indicating that the ADP concentration was sufficiently high to ensure that the observed kinetics reflect true dissociation kinetics for MANT-ADP (data not shown). The presence of biphasic kinetics for MANT-ADP dissociation in trapping experiments may be interpreted by a two-step binding mechanism for this ligand as described in Scheme 2. Under conditions in which the two observed kinetic phases are separated by rate as in Fig. 4, the fast phase approximates k—1 (36Torok K. Trentham D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2072793063,"At vertebrate neuromuscular junctions, ATP is known to stabilize acetylcholine in the synaptic vesicles and to be co-released with it. We have shown previously that a nucleotide receptor, P2Y1 receptor, is localized at the nmjs, and we propose that this mediates a trophic role for synaptic ATP there. In cultured myotubes, the activation of P2Y1 receptors modulated agrin-induced acetylcholine receptor (AChR) aggregation in a potentiation manner. This potentiation effect in agrin-induced AChR aggregation was reduced by antagonizing the P2Y1 receptors. The guanosine triphosphatase RhoA was shown to be responsible for this P2Y1-potentiated effect. The localization of RhoA in rat and chicken skeletal muscles was restricted at the neuromuscular junctions. Application of P2Y1 agonists in cultured myotubes induced RhoA activation, which showed an additive effect with agrin-induced RhoA activation. Over-expression of dominant-negative mutant of RhoA in cultured myotubes diminished the agrin-induced AChR aggregation, as well as the potentiation effect of P2Y1-specific agonist. Application of UTP in the cultures also triggered similar responses as did 2-methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate, suggesting the involvement of other subtypes of P2Y receptors. These results demonstrate that RhoA could serve as a downstream mediator of signaling mediated by P2Y1 receptor and agrin, which therefore synergizes the effects of the two neuron-derived trophic factors in modulating the formation and/or maintenance of post-synaptic apparatus at the neuromuscular junctions.

The initial stage of AChR aggregation at nmjs is controlled by agrin synthesized by the pre-synaptic motor neuron (1Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Moscoso L. Rupp F. Scheller R.H. Merlie J.P. Sanes J.R.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1057-1064Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of agrin-induced AChR aggregation, however, is poorly understood. The agrin-induced post-synaptic specialization is mediated by muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) (6DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Park J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 501-512Google Scholar), and indeed, the phenotype of MuSK-deficient mice show similar neuromuscular defects to those in agrin-deficient mice (7Glass D.J. Bowen D.C. Stitt T.N. Radziejewski C. Bruno J. Ryan T.E. Gies D.R. Shah S. Mattsson K. Burden S.J. DiStefano P.S. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 513-523Google Scholar). Another key component involved in the downstream signaling of MuSK is rapsyn, a 43-kDa protein closely associated with the intracellular face of AChR (8Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Google Scholar, 9Watty A. Neubauer G. Dreger M. Zimmer M. Wilm M. Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4585-4590Google Scholar) at the post-synaptic membrane. Rapsyn knock-out mice lack aggregates of AChRs and other post-synaptic proteins (10Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Google Scholar), and myotubes derived from rapsyn-deficient mice also fail to respond to agrin in forming AChR aggregates (8Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Google Scholar). Several downstream effects of agrin and MuSK signaling have been proposed. Agrin has been shown to activate Rho family of guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac, Cdc-42, and RhoA, and these molecules are required for agrin-induced AChR aggregation in myotubes (11Weston C. Yee B. Hod E. Prives J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 205-212Google Scholar, 12Weston C. Gordon C. Teressa G. Hod E. Ren X.D. Prives J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6450-6455Google Scholar). The mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in post-synaptic muscle has been demonstrated to regulate the formation and/or the maintenance of agrin-induced AChR aggregation (13Megeath L.J. Fallon J.R. J.

Neuron. 2002; 35: 489-505Google Scholar) have also been revealed to associate with agrin and MuSK signaling at the nmjs. ATP is an additional potential trophic factor at the nmjs (23Tsim K.W.K. Barnard E.A. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar, 24Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Ling K.K.Y. Jiang J.X.S. Tung E.K.K. Lee H.C. Xie Q.H. Simon J. Barnard E.A. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 603-617Google Scholar). In the synaptic vesicles at vertebrate nmjs (25Silinsky E.M. Redman R.S. J. Physiol. 1996; 492: 815-822Google Scholar), ATP stabilizes acetylcholine (ACh) and is co-released quantally with it in a ratio of about 1 ATP to 5 ACh. The synaptic ATP, mediated by P2Y1 nucleotide receptors, induces and sustains the expression of AChE and AChR in muscles, and P2Y1 receptor is localized at the nmjs (24Tsim K.W.K. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Ling K.K.Y. Jiang J.X.S. Tung E.K.K. Lee H.C. Xie Q.H. Simon J. Barnard E.A. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 603-617Google Scholar, 26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). The P2Y1 receptor-mediated gene activations including AChE and different subunits of AChR are acted upon through the mobilization of intracellular inositol triphosphate and Ca2+, and subsequently, the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (27Choi R.C. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W. Ling K.K. Tung E.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the roles of ATP and its activation of P2Y1 receptors in potentiating the agrin-induced AChR aggregation in cultured myotubes. Several lines of evidence support the notion. There is much evidence that the native P2Y1 receptor in tissues, as well as in muscle, so far examined is linked to the formation of inositol triphosphate and to intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (see references in Refs. 23Tsim K.W.K. Barnard E.A. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar, 26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). ATP potentiates the response to the applied ACh in nerve-muscle co-culture (see references in Ref. 23Tsim K.W.K. Barnard E.A. Neurosignals. 2002; 11: 58-64Google Scholar), which is in line with the activity-dependence of the reshaping of synaptic architecture at the nmjs (4Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Google Scholar). On the other hand, the application of P2Y1 receptor agonists activated the membrane-bound RhoA and stimulated the actin cytoskeleton organization in cultured vascular myocytes (28Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Vaillant N. Gadeau A. Desgranges C. Scalbert E. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Lairand G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1751-H1761Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that the activation of P2Y1 receptors induced the formation of membrane-bound RhoA, which subsequently potentiated the agrin-induced AChR aggregation on post-synaptic muscle fibers. Materials and Purity of Nucleotides—Materials not specified here were obtained as before (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar) or from Sigma. Cell culture medium and serum were obtained from Invitrogen. 2-Methylthioadenosine 5′-diphosphate (2-MeSADP) stock solution (100 mm) was pre-incubated with 20 units/ml of yeast hexokinase (Roche Biochemicals, Lewes, UK) in Buffer A (2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) containing 25 mm glucose at 37 °C for 30 min to remove all contaminating triphosphates, whereas ATP stock solution (100 mm) was pretreated in Buffer A with 20 units/ml of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma) and 10 mm creatine phosphate (Sigma) at room temperature for 90 min to remove all contaminating diphosphates (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). Anti-RhoA antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Rac antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); others not stated were from Sigma; and peroxidase- or fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Cappel (Turnhout, Belgium). Tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (TMR-BuTX) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Animals—Muscles from adult Sprague-Dawley rats and New Hampshire chickens were collected immediately after the animals were killed. Animals were rapidly frozen in isopentane/liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. All procedures conformed to the Guidelines by Animal Research Panel of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Cell Cultures—Eggs of New Hampshire chickens were purchased from a local farm and hatched in the University Animal Care Facility. Primary chick myotubes were prepared from hindlimb muscles dissected from 11-day-old chick embryos and cultured at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere, as described previously (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). Myotubes were treated with a mitotic inhibitor (10 μm cytosine arabinoside) at day 3 after plating and used on day 4. Undifferentiated mouse C2C12 myoblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and were incubated at 37 °Cina water-saturated atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Differentiation of myoblast to myotube was induced by replacing the growth medium with DMEM supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated horse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described previously (29Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle cells in culture release ATP into the medium and also can convert it there to ADP, which, over longer periods, may give some desensitization of P2Y receptors. The cultures were pretreated in all cases with apyrase (2 units/ml; Sigma) for 1 h to eliminate all such free nucleotides, followed by a gentle wash and drug application in apyrase-free medium (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). For longer incubations with an agonist, significant loss thereof due to the ectonucleotidase on muscle cells was prevented (where stated) by maintaining the appropriate enzymatic regeneration system throughout (hexokinase/glucose or creatine phosphokinase/creatine phosphate in Buffer A) as noted above, as well as by three changes of the agonist solution at approximately equal intervals. cDNA Transfections—For the source of agrin, the sub-confluent HEK293 cells were transfected with chicken agrin cDNA encoding a secretory form of agrin (CBA-1; Ref. 30Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Google Scholar) by calcium phosphate. The agrin-conditioned medium was collected with the addition of 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride and 5% glycerol and stored at –80 °C. The unit of agrin was calibrated as reported previously (30Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA encoding chicken P2Y1 receptor (31Webb T.E. Simon J. Krishek B.J. Bateson A.N. Smart T.G. King B.F. Burnstock G. Barnard E.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 219-225Google Scholar) in an expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used where stated. RhoA cDNAs encoding the wild-type RhoA (RhoAWT, GenBank accession no. AY026068) was generated by RT-PCR from rat muscle cells. The dominant-negative RhoA (RhoAN19) was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the RhoAWT, in which amino acid asparagine at position 19 was mutated to threonine (32Feig L.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 25-27Google Scholar). All cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA3, verified therein, and used for transfection. Myoblasts from 11-day-old chick embryos were cultured at 37 °C for 2 days and transiently transfected with the plasmid constructs (2 μg of plasmid per 35-mm plate or 10 μg per 100-mm plate) with the use of calcium phosphate. Myoblasts were then allowed to fuse to myotubes for the treatments stated, with the methods given in Ref. 26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar. In C2C12 myoblasts, the transfection was done by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) (29Siow N.L. Choi R.C.Y. Cheng A.W.M. Jiang J.X.S. Wan D.C.C. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36129-36136Google Scholar). The transfection efficiency in both cases was determined with enzymatic staining from control cells co-transfected with β-galactosidase cDNA in the same vector; it was consistently ∼30%. Immunohistochemical Staining—Myotube cultures were treated with P2Y1 receptor antagonists or together with agrin-conditioned medium for 16 h to study AChR aggregation. Cell-surface AChR was stained by incubating the treated cultures with 10–8m TMR-BuTX in DMEM for 1 h, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS for 10 min, and then dried by increasing amounts of ethanol. The cultures were mounted in Citifluor (Citifluor Ltd., Leicester, UK). The AChR aggregates were counted under a 40× objective on a Zeiss Axiophot equipped with phase-contrast and fluorescence optics as described previously (30Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Google Scholar, 33Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 783-794Google Scholar). The mean number of AChR aggregates per field in a single myotube was determined by counting 20 different myotubes from different fields. In general, two to three myotubes were counted from a single field. Experiments were repeated at least four times, each with triplicate cultures. For the pre-labeling AChR studies, myotube cultures were incubated with 10–6m TMR-BuTX in DMEM prior to the agrin treatment. AChR aggregation was quantified similarly as above (30Tsim K.W.K. Ruegg M.A. Escher G. Kröger S. McMahan U.J. Neuron. 1992; 8: 677-689Google Scholar, 33Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 783-794Google Scholar). Muscle sections were prepared from the pectoral and gastrocnemius muscles of adult chicken and rat, respectively, embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Leica Instruments, Nussloch, Germany), and frozen in an isopentane/liquid nitrogen bath. Twenty μm muscle sections generated on cryostat were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, followed by three 5-min washes in PBS and a blocking step in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min. The slides were incubated with ∼5 μg/ml anti-RhoA antibody in PBS with 5% BSA for 16 h at 4 °C. RhoA mouse monoclonal antibody recognizes epitope corresponding to amino acids 120–150 of RhoA. For double-staining of AChR, 10–8m TMR-BuTX was incubated together with anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h. Sections were washed 3× with PBS for 10 min each and then dehydrated in ice-cold 100% ethanol; the sections were mounted with Citifluor mounting media and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with fluorescent and rhodamine optics, using excitation at 555 or 488 nm and emission at 580 or 515 nm for rhodamine or fluorescein, respectively. RhoA and Rac Activation Assay—For the measurement of membrane-bound (activated form) RhoA protein, the treated myotubes were collected in PBS with 10 mm EDTA and centrifuged at 2,300 × g for 7 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride). The cellular suspension was passed through a G-27 gauge needle ten times for lysis of the cells. The cell extracts were separated by low speed centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was then collected and further centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet representing the membrane fraction was resuspended in 50–100 μl of Buffer B and was then ready for Western blot analysis of RhoA. An affinity precipitation method described in the Rho or Rac activity assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was also used. Cultured chick myotubes were treated with agrin or with indicated drugs for indicated times and rinsed with PBS. The cells were then lysed with Buffer C (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected as cell lysate, and 2 mg of the lysate were incubated with glutathione-agarose bound to 20 μg of Rho-binding domain (RBD) from the effector protein Rhotekin for RhoA, or 10 μg of Rac-binding domain (p21-binding domain) from the effector protein p21-activated kinase (PAK) for Rac (Upstate Biotechnology) for 45 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3× with Buffer C. The bound Rho or Rac proteins were eluted with sample buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel, detected by using an anti-RhoA or anti-Rac antibody in a 1:1000 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody against mouse IgG in a 1:5000 dilution in a Western blot analysis. The Rac antibody recognizes Rac1 and Rac2. The immunocomplexes were visualized by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). The intensity of the bands in the control and agonist-stimulated samples, run on the same gel and under strictly standardized ECL conditions, were compared on an image analyzer, in each case using a calibration plot constructed from a parallel gel with serial dilutions of one of those samples. Other Assays—The concentration of protein was determined by using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Hercules, CA); the concentration of sample protein was compared against the standard curve, which was generated from the relative absorbance (595 nm) of the BSA standard (0.1–0.6 μg/ml) added with dye reagent. Statistical tests were made by the PRIMER version 1 software program (47Glantz S.A. Primer of Biostatistics. McGraw-Hill, New York1988Google Scholar): differences from basal or control values (as shown in the plots in Figs. 1, 2, and 8) were classed as significant, or *, where p < 0.05, and highly significant, or **, where p < 0.001.Fig. 2The ATP-potentiation effect is blocked by P2Y1-specific antagonist. A, chick or C2C12 myotubes were treated with agonist 2-MeSADP (50 μm), antagonist A2P5P (100 μm), and agrin (2 units) for 16 h as described in Fig. 1. B, cultured chick myotubes were transiently transfected with chicken P2Y1 cDNA for 4 days before the treatment of apyrase.

Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar). The application of agrin (2 units) induced an ∼4- to 5-fold increase of AChR aggregates in both types of myotube cultures (Fig. 1, A and B). The size of these aggregates was larger than 10 μm, and the smaller aggregates (<10 μm) were not counted in here. In both types of myotubes, the formation of AChR aggregates, induced by agrin, was potentiated by an ∼50% increase after the application of 50 μm P2Y1 agonists, ATP (a nonspecific agonist), or 2-Me-SADP (a specific agonist), to the cultured myotubes (Fig. 1). This concentration of P2Y agonists has been shown to be the optimized dosage in inducing the downstream signaling cascade, including the accumulation of inositol triphosphate and the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (26Choi R.C.Y.

J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Google Scholar). In addition, the concentration used for P2Y agonists is within the physiological range of ATP at the synaptic cleft. The sizes of the aggregates remained constant throughout the drug treatments in both chick and C2C12 myotubes. The treatment of P2Y1 agonists slightly increased the basal spontaneous AChR aggregates. Adenosine, an agonist for P1 nucleotide receptor, did not show any potentiation effect upon the agrin-induced AChR aggregation (Fig. 1). Therefore, these results suggest that the potentiation effect of synaptic ATP in regulating the formation of agrin-induced AChR aggregates was mediated by P2Y1 receptor. The specificity of the ATP response at the cultured myotubes was further confirmed by using P2Y1-specific antagonist. Application of A2P5P did not alter the formation of agrin-induced AChR aggregates, except for an insignificant reduction of the aggregate observed in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 2A). The potentiation of agrin-induced AChR aggregation, mediated by 2-Me-SADP, was significantly reduced by the application of A2P5P in the cultures. To enhance the signals, cDNA-encoding chicken P2Y1 receptor was over-expressed in cultured myotubes by DNA transfection. The P2Y1 receptor over-expressed myotubes showed a high background of spontaneous AChR aggregates; nevertheless, the response to agrin was retained (Fig. 2B). Suramin, an antagonist for P2Y receptor, completely blocked the agrin-induced AChR aggregation in the receptor over-expressed myotubes, as well as the background aggregates induced by the over-expression of P2Y1 receptor. In parallel, A2P5P abolished the agrin-induced AChR aggregation. We have found previously (26Choi R.C.Y. Man M.L.S. Ling K.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9224-9234Google Scholar, 27Choi R.C. Siow N.L. Cheng A.W. Ling K.K. Tung E.K. Simon J. Barnard E.A. Tsim K.W. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 4445-4456Google Scholar) that activation by adenosine triand diphosphates of the P2Y1 receptors present in cultured chick myotubes leads to an increase in the expression of the AChR gene. The increased AChR number after the activation of P2Y1 receptors could explain the increase of the AChR aggregation as revealed here. To eliminate the contribution of newly synthesized AChR after the challenge of 2-MeSADP, the receptors were pre-labeled by TMR-BuTX before the application of agrin and/or the agonist. An increase of over 2-fold pre-labeled AChR aggregate was induced by agrin (Fig. 3). This 2-fold increase of AChR aggregation was much smaller than that of the induction revealed in the above analysis, when all of the AChRs were labeled after agrin treatment. This discrepancy could be due to the rapid turnover of the AChR, because the newly synthesized receptors were not counted in this prelabel study. The potentiation effect of ATP in agrin-induced AChR aggregation, however, was retained. An increase of over 4-fold AChR aggregation was revealed when 2-MeSADP was applied together with agrin (Fig. 3). This result revealed that the P2Y1-potentiated effect upon AChR aggregation was not due to the increased expression of AChR. Activation of RhoA Is Mediated by ATP and P2Y1 Receptors— Small GTPase is known to play roles in the organization of cytoskeletal elements in cells, as well as in the aggregation of post-synaptic AChRs at vertebrate nmjs. Therefore, the functional role of RhoA was determined here. The localization of RhoA protein in skeletal muscle was determined by using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA. The RhoA immunoreactivity was co-localized with the binding of TMR-BuTX, indicating the restricted localization of RhoA at adult rat nmjs (Fig. 4). That location of RhoA was not only revealed in rat muscle, but it was also co-localized with AChR in adult chicken muscle. A weak staining by anti-RhoA antibody could still be observed in some extra-junctional areas in both species. The activation of RhoA was examined after stimulating the endogenous P2Y1 receptors in cultured myotubes. Active RhoA is known to re-localize from a cytosolic form to a membrane-bound form. Thus, the P2Y1-activated RhoA was determined in the membrane fraction of cultured myotubes. The antibody to RhoA readily detected a band at ∼21 kDa in chick myotubes (Fig. 5A, upper panel). In chick myotubes, ATP and 2-MeSADP induced a transient activation of RhoA; the level of membr"
