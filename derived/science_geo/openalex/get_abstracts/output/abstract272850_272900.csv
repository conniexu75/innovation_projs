New spaceborne methods and associated technologies are being developed to produce data from which geologic information about large areas can be derived much more rapidly than by conventional techniques."

https://openalex.org/W1985858831,"The structure of L(8)S(8) RuBisCo (where L is the large subunit and S is the small subunit) from spinach has been determined to a resolution of 2.8 Ã¥ngstrom by using fourfold averaging of an isomorphous electron density map based on three heavy-atom derivatives. The structure of the S subunit is different from that previously reported for the tobacco S subunit in spite of 75 percent sequence identity. The elements of secondary structure, four antiparallel beta strands and two alpha helices, are the same, but the topology and direction of the polypeptide chain through these elements differ completely. One of these models is clearly wrong. The spinach model has hydrophobic residues in the core between the alpha helices and beta sheet as well as conserved residues in the subunit interactions. The deletion of residues 49 to 62 that is present in the Anabaena sequence removes a loop region in the spinach model. The positions of three mercury atoms in the heavy-atom derivatives agree with the assignment of side chains in the spinach structure."

It is shown here that bees can in fact detect airborne sounds and that they do so by detecting air-particle movements. Most vertebrates, by contrast, detect pressure oscillations. Because all traveling sound waves have both components, either can be used in sound detection. The bees' acoustic sense appears to be sensitive enough to allow bees to detect the air-particle movements that occur within several millimeters of a sound-emitting dancer."

https://openalex.org/W2071313447,"The prehistoric development and spread of domesticated maize varieties in the highlands of Peru, unlike the drier coastal deserts, is little known because ancient maize remains in this area survive mainly as fragments, kernels, and cob parts. An analysis of fragmented charred maize from prehistoric households (A.D.450 to 1500) in the Mantaro Valley reveals a developmental sequence of maize varieties for Highland Peru. The evidence indicates an adoption of large-kernelled maize varieties beginning in the Late Intermediate (A.D. 1000). This is centuries later than a similar change in maize, associated with the Wari expansion, that occurred in coastal areas, and indicates minimal Wari impact in the Mantaro Valley."

With Cellophane bags of suitable surface, the growth of the submerged and surface penicillin producing strains of Penicillium notatum is significantly faster and more abundant; penicillin makes its appearance earlier and reaches higher concentration in larger total volumes than in control cultures without Cellophane. Thus the gain with the method described is both in the rate of production as well as in the total yield of penicillin. The enhancement also occurs under conditions unfavorable for development of penicillin, namely, (a) with degenerated cultures of the mold; and (b) when the surface penicillin producing strain is grown in cultures with an unfavorably small [See Equation In PDF file] ratio (0.0315). There is also noted a markedly stabilizing effect of Cellophane upon the H-ion concentration of abundantly growing cultures during active production of penicillin. The stabilization is of significance, since the sharp rise in pH usually occurring in Penicillium cultures tends to destroy rapidly the penicillin."

https://openalex.org/W2082438445,"The two-neutrino experiment established a relationship between particles, muon and muon neutrino, electron and electron neutrino, which evolved into the standard model of particle physics. The theme of this article is a personal one, which reviews a series of experiments at the Columbia Synchrocyclotron, the Brookhaven Cosmotron, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, the CERN intersecting storage rings, the Fermilab 400-gigavolt proton synchrotron, and the Cornell electron storage rings, all of which were important in the evolution of the standard model. In some cases the fermion particles were discovered (the second neutrino vmicro, b quark); in other cases fields of research were opened (muon spin resonance, neutral kaons and charge-parity violation, dimuons and the Drell-Yan process), which led to further development of the standard model. Finally, the current ignorance about the properties of now three neutrinos is reviewed."
