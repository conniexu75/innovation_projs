https://openalex.org/W2037592076,"Two ice cores, covering 1500 years of climatic information, from the summit (5670 meters) of the tropical Quelccaya ice cap, in the Andes of southern Peru, provide information on general environmental conditions including droughts, volcanic activity, moisture sources, temperature, and glacier net balance. The net balance record reconstructed from these cores reflects major precipitation trends for the southern Andes of Peru. These records indicate extended dry periods between 1720 and 1860, 1250 and 1310, and 570 and 610; wet conditions prevailed between 1500 and 1720. Establishing a tropical precipitation record may help explain climatic fluctuations since the tropical evaporation-precipitation cycle is a principal mechanism driving the atmospheric circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2025688862,"The concentration pattern of rare earth elements on fine airborne particles (less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) is distorted from the crustal abundance pattern in areas influenced by emissions from oil-fired plants and refineries. For example, the ratio of lanthanum to samarium is often greater than 20 compared to a crustal ratio less than 6. The unusual pattern apparently results from the distribution of rare earths in zeolite catalysts used in refining oil. Oil industry emissions perturb the rare earth pattern even at remote locations such as the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. Rare earth ratios are probably better for long-range tracing of oil emissions than vanadium and nickel concentrations because the ratios of rare earths on fine particles are probably not influenced by deposition and other fractionating processes. Emissions from oil-fired plants can be differentiated from those of refineries on an urban scale by the much smaller amounts of vanadium in the latter."
https://openalex.org/W2063232361,A new method for estimating the age of the earth consists of calculating a Pb^207 / Pb^206 age from the observed differences between the isotropic composition of recent lead isolated from the surface of the earth where appreciable concentrations of uranium exist and the isotropic composition of lead isolated from iron meteorites where insignificant concentrations of uranium are found (1-3).
https://openalex.org/W2035312181,"Observations of malic acid fluctuation, leaf anatomy, and stable carbon isotopic composition showed that the epiphytic strangler Clusia rosea, growing on Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands, has crassulacean acid metabolism. This hemiepiphyte may be the only woody dicotyledonous tree species among the many thousands of flowering species in the 30 or more plant families that shows this type of metabolism. The finding has implications with respect to water balance during the process whereby Clusia rosea establishes itself as a tree, since crassulacean acid metabolism is a photosynthetic adaptation to water-stressed environments."

https://openalex.org/W2079620333,"THE subject to which I shall invite your attention this evening is by no means novel, but might better be called perennial or recurrent; for the problem of our earth's age seems to bear repeated solution without loss of vigour or prestige. It has been a marked favourite, moreover, with presidents and vice-presidents, retiring or otherwise, when called upon to address assemblies whose fields of scientific interest are somewhat diverseâ€”for the reason, I imagine, that while the specialist claims the problem as his peculiar theme of study, he feels that other denizens of the planet in question may not lack interest in the early lore of their estate."
