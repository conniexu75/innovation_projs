https://openalex.org/W1979877257,The partial amino-acid sequence of purified human transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) was used to identify a series of cDNA clones encoding the protein. The cDNA sequence indicates that the 112-amino acid monomeric form of the natural TGF-β homodimer is derived proteolytically from a much longer precursor polypeptide which may be secreted. TGF-β messenger RNA is synthesized in various normal and transformed cells.

Key innovations include solid-phase synthesis on silica-based supports and the development of stable deoxynucleoside phosphoramidites as synthons. When incorporated into manual, semiautomatic, or automatic instruments, these new procedures can be used to prepare probes, mixed probes, deoxyoligonucleotides for priming DNA synthesis, analogues of deoxyoligonucleotides, and DNA segments containing more than 100 deoxynucleotides."
https://openalex.org/W1982213879,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a soluble protein that causes damage to tumor cells but has no effect on normal cells. Human TNF was purified to apparent homogeneity as a 17.3-kilodalton protein from HL-60 leukemia cells and showed cytotoxic and cytostatic activities against various human tumor cell lines. The amino acid sequence was determined for the amino terminal end of the purified protein, and oligodeoxyribonucleotide probes were synthesized on the basis of this sequence. Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding human TNF was cloned from induced HL-60 messenger RNA and was confirmed by hybrid-selection assay, direct expression in COS-7 cells, and nucleotide sequence analysis. The human TNF cDNA is 1585 base pairs in length and encodes a protein of 233 amino acids. The mature protein begins at residue 77, leaving a long leader sequence of 76 amino acids. Expression of high levels of human TNF in Escherichia coli was accomplished under control of the bacteriophage lambda PL promoter and gene N ribosome binding site."

https://openalex.org/W1573946811,"Pertussis toxin catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD to the guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins Gi, Go, and transducin. Based on a partial amino acid sequence for a tryptic peptide of ADP-ribosylated transducin, asparagine had been characterized as the site of pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Subsequently, cDNA data for the alpha subunit of transducin indicated that the putative asparagine residue was, in fact, not present in the protein. To determine the amino acid that served as the ADP-ribose acceptor, radiolabel from [adenine-U-14C]NAD was incorporated, in the presence of pertussis toxin, into the alpha subunit of transducin (0.3 mol/mol). An ADP-ribosylated, tryptic peptide was purified and fully sequenced by automated Edman degradation. The amino acid sequence, Glu-Asn 343-Leu-Lys-Asp 346-X-Gly 348-Leu-Phe, corresponds to the cDNA sequence coding the carboxyl-terminal nonapeptide, Glu 342-Phe 350, which includes by cDNA sequence cysteine at position 347. Neither Asn 343 nor Asp 346 appeared to be modified; residue 347 adhered to the sequencing resin. Cysteine, the missing residue, was eluted from the sequencing resin with acetic acid along with 76% of the peptide-associated radioactivity, half of which, presumably ADP-ribosylcysteine, eluted from an anion exchange column between NAD and ADP-ribose; the other half had a retention time corresponding to 5'-AMP. We conclude that Cys 347 and not Asn 343 or Asp 346 is the site of pertusis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation in transducin."
https://openalex.org/W2026401160,"Transforming growth factors (TGFs) are mitogenic polypeptides produced most conspicuously by transformed cells and conferring on normal cells several phenotypic alterations associated with transformation1,2. TGFs comprise two distinct sets of molecules: TGF-αs are structurally similar to epidermal growth factor (EGF), binding to and inducing the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in a manner indistinguishable from that of EGF3. In addition, the 50-amino acid rat TGF-α4 has 33 and 44% homologies with mouse5 and human6 EGFs, respectively, and shares with EGFs a conserved pattern of three disulphide bridges7. Thus, it has been proposed that TGF-αs belong to a family of EGF-like polypeptides7. TGF-βs, on the other hand, display no measurable binding to EGF receptors, but potentiate the growth stimulating activities of TGF-α8. Here we report the isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding rat TGF-α. This cDNA hybridizes to a 4.5-kilobase (kb) messenger RNA that is 30 times larger than necessary to code for a 50-amino acid polypeptide and is present not only in retrovirus-transformed rat cells but also at lower levels in normal rat tissues. The nucleotide sequence of the cDNA predicts that TGF-α is synthesized as a larger product and that the larger form may exist as a transmembrane protein. However, unlike many polypeptide hormones (including EGF9,10), cleavage of the 50-amino acid TGF-α from the larger form does not occur at paired basic residues, but rather between alanine and valine residues, suggesting the role of a novel protease."

https://openalex.org/W2049596148,"A bovine retinal complementary DNA clone encoding the alpha subunit of transducin (T alpha) was isolated with the use of synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides as probes, and the complete nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined. THe predicted protein sequence of 354 amino acids includes the known sequences of four tryptic peptides and sequences adjacent to the residues that undergo adenosine diphosphate ribosylation by cholera toxin and pertussis toxin. On the basis of homologies to other proteins, such as the elongation factors of protein synthesis and the ras oncogene proteins, regions are identified that are predicted to be acylated and involved in guanine nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Amino acid sequence similarity between T alpha and ras is confined to these regions of the molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2007706733,"In an attempt to establish a model of the healthy carrier state in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, transgenic mice expressing HBV genes were produced. Fertilized one-cell eggs were microinjected with subgenomic fragments of HBV DNA containing the coding regions for the HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and pre-S and X antigens. Either the normal (HBV) or metallothionein promoters were used to obtain expression of the HBV genes. There was no evidence of viral replication or tissue pathology. The integrated HBV DNA sequences were inherited in a normal Mendelian fashion. Three of 16 transgenic mice expressed HBV-encoded gene products to which they were immunologically tolerant. Expression was not tissue specific and may be influenced by the genomic integration site and cellular factors. Both HBsAg and pre-S antigen were detectable within the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and renal tubular epithelial cells. High serum concentrations of HBsAg were detectable and the secreted product appeared authentic as judged by mean density, morphology, mean particle diameter, polypeptide composition, and antigenicity. The absence of tissue pathology in these immunologically tolerant animals supports the hypothesis that cellular injury under these conditions is not a direct consequence of expression of the pre-S or HBs regions of the HBV genome."
https://openalex.org/W2065279356,"The environmental contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) may produce its effects by altering gene expression in susceptible cells. In mouse hepatoma cells, TCDD induces the transcription of the cytochrome P1-450 gene, whose product, aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase, contributes both to the detoxification and to the metabolic activation of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A DNA fragment containing sequences flanking the 5' end of the cytochrome P1-450 gene was isolated and analyzed. This DNA fragment contains a cis-acting control element with at least three functional domains: a putative promoter, an inhibitory domain upstream from the promoter that blocks its function, and a TCDD-responsive domain still farther (1265 to 1535 base pairs) upstream of the promoter. These findings, together with results from earlier studies, imply that transcription of the cytochrome P1-450 gene is under both positive and negative control by at least two trans-acting regulatory factors."

https://openalex.org/W1522425622,"We have used affinity chromatography on columns containing immobilized calf thymus RNA polymerase II to isolate three phosphoproteins (RAP72, RAP38, and RAP30) that bind directly to RNA polymerase II. All could be isolated from cell nuclei, and all three could be detected in mouse and human tissue culture cell lines, but only RAP38 and RAP30 have so far been isolated from calf thymus. RAP38 stimulates nonspecific transcription of native DNA templates by RNA polymerase II in the presence of Mn2+; it appears to be similar or identical to SII, a previously identified RNA polymerase II stimulatory factor (Nakanishi, Y., Mitsuhashi, Y., Sekimizu, K., Yokoi, H., Tanaka, Y., Horikoshi, M., and Natori, S. (1981) FEBS Lett. 130, 69-72). Unlike RAP38, RAP72 and RAP30 do not affect nonspecific transcription by RNA polymerase II. However, RAP30 may have a role in regulating some alterations of transcription that accompany cellular differentiation; RAP30 is partially dephosphorylated when murine erythroleukemia cells are induced with dimethyl sulfoxide to undergo terminal erythroid differentiation. We suggest that phosphate groups in RNA polymerase II-binding proteins may regulate transcription by modulating the interaction of RNA polymerase II with other regulatory proteins that possess sequence recognition specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2039431622,"Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained by feedback inhibition of transcription of the gene encoding HMG CoA reductase. To study this mechanism, we joined the 5′ end of the hamster reductase gene to the coding region for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The chimeric gene produced high levels of CAT activity in mouse L cells; sterols suppressed expression by 70% to 90%. Sequences responsible for both promotion and inhibition of transcription were distributed over 500 by extending 300 by upstream of the reductase transcription initiation sites. Any sizable deletion within this region decreased CAT expression in vivo and CAT mRNA transcription in vitro. This region contains five hexanucleotide repeats (CCGCCC or GGGCGG) that occur in promoters of viral and cellular housekeeping genes. Every reductase-CAT plasmid that showed transcriptional activity also showed inhibition by sterols, indicating that the sites for promotion and inhibition of transcription are closely associated."
https://openalex.org/W2070443263,"Sequences upstream from the proto-oncogene fos were shown to be essential for its transcription. Transient expression of the chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) gene linked to upstream sequences of the fos gene including its promoter reveals that sequences located 64 to 404 base pairs 5' to the fos cap site contain a typical transcriptional enhancer. Moreover, these enhancer sequences, which are strikingly conserved between mouse and human fos genes, coincide with a deoxyribonuclease I-hypersensitive site in the chromatin. The expression of the fos-CAT fusion genes was stimulated only two to three times by the fos inducer 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. The fos enhancer does not appear to be tissue-specific."
https://openalex.org/W2044828812,"Two transgenic mice were obtained that contain in their chromosomes the complete hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome except for the core gene. These mice secrete particles of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. In one mouse, HBV DNA sequences that had integrated at two different sites were shown to segregate independently in the first filial generation (F1) and only one of the sequences allowed expression of the surface antigen. Among these animals the males produced five to ten times more HBsAg than the females. A 2.1-kilobase messenger RNA species comigrating with the major surface gene messenger RNA is expressed specifically in the liver in the two original mice. The results suggest that the HBV sequences introduced into the mice are able to confer a tissue-specific expression to the S gene. In addition, the HBV transgenic mice represent a new model for the chronic carrier state of hepatitis B virus infection."

https://openalex.org/W1496876439,"Prostaglandin F synthetase from bovine lung was purified 540-fold to apparent homogeneity, as assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses and ultracentrifugation. The purified enzyme proved to be a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of about 30,500. The enzyme catalyzed not only the reduction of the 11-keto group of prostaglandin D2 but also the reduction of 9,11-endoperoxide of prostaglandin H2 and various carbonyl compounds (e.g. phenanthrenequinone). Experiments using column chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses, immunotitration using antibody against the purified enzyme, and heat treatment indicated that three enzyme activities resided in a single protein. Although phenanthrenequinone and prostaglandin D2 competitively inhibited the prostaglandin D2 and phenanthrenequinone reductase activities, respectively, these two substrates were all but ineffective on the prostaglandin H2 (at the Km value) reductase activity up to 14-fold of those Km values. These results suggest that a single enzyme protein purified from the bovine lung catalyzes the reduction of prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin H2, and various carbonyl compounds and that prostaglandin D2 and prostaglandin H2 are metabolized at two different active sites, yielding prostaglandin F2 alpha as the reaction product."

https://openalex.org/W2061455216,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is caused by a genetic deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). A full-length complementary DNA clone of human PAH was inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and transferred into mouse NIH3T3 cells which do not normally express PAH. The transformed mouse cells expressed PAH messenger RNA, immunoreactive protein, and enzymatic activity that are characteristic of the normal human liver products, demonstrating that a single gene contains all of the necessary genetic information to code for functional PAH. These results support the use of the human PAH probe in prenatal diagnosis and detection of carriers, to provide new opportunities for the biochemical characterization of normal and mutant enzymes, and in the investigation of alternative genetic therapies for PKU."
https://openalex.org/W2081134196,Transforming growth factor-type α accelerated incisor eruption and eyelid opening in the newborn mouse and also retarded the growth rates of hair and body weight when administered in high dosage (0.7 to 4 micrograms per gram of body weight). The results of whole animal studies indicate that transforming growth factor-type α and epidermal growth factor do not differ significantly in these effects and suggest that transforming growth factor-type α may be important in immature animals.

The structures of the native substances and the products obtained after treatment with alpha-galactosidase (BIrab-2 alpha, Birab alpha) and subsequent Smith degradation (BIrab-2 alpha SD) were determined by sugar analysis, methylation analysis, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of the permethylated derivatives.

https://openalex.org/W1547971522,"50 microCi of [3H]prostaglandin D2 tracer (100 Ci/mmol) was infused intravenously into a normal human male volunteer. 75% of the infused radioactivity was excreted into the urine within 5 h. This urine was added to urine obtained from two mastocytosis patients with marked overproduction of prostaglandin D2. Radiolabeled prostaglandin D2 urinary metabolites were chromatographically isolated and purified and subsequently identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 25 metabolites were identified. 23 of these compounds comprising 37% of the recovered radioactivity had prostaglandin F-ring structures, and only two metabolites comprising 2.7% of the recovered radioactivity retained the prostaglandin D-ring structure. The single most abundant metabolite identified was 9,11-dihydroxy-15-oxo-2,3,18,19-tetranorprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid which was isolated in a tricyclic form as a result of formation of a lower side chain hemiketal followed by lactonization of the terminal carboxyl and the hemiketal hydroxyl. Different isomeric forms of several prostaglandin F-ring metabolites were identified. An isomer of prostaglandin F2 alpha was also excreted intact into the urine as a metabolite of prostaglandin D2. 15 PGF-ring compounds were treated with n-butylboronic acid and 13 failed to form a boronate derivative, suggesting that the orientation of the hydroxyl group at C-11 in these 13 metabolites is beta. This study documents that prostaglandin D2 is metabolized to prostaglandin F-ring metabolites in vivo in humans. These results also bring into question the accuracy of quantifying prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolites as a specific index of endogenous prostaglandin F2 alpha biosynthesis, as well as quantifying urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha as an accurate index of renal production of prostaglandin F2 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2139331781,"Polylactosaminoglycans were isolated from human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and their structures were elucidated. The lactosaminoglycan saccharides were isolated by hydrazinolysis and fractionated by QAE-Sephadex. The structures of fractionated oligosaccharides were analyzed by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry and methylation before and after treatment with specific exoglycosidases, such as alpha 2----3 specific neuraminidase. Based on these experiments, the structures of sialyl polylactosaminoglycans of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells were found to contain the following unique structure which is absent in normal mature granulocytes: (formula; see text) In addition to this, chronic myelogenous leukemia polylactosaminoglycans can be distinguished from normal granulocyte polylactosaminoglycans by the following characteristics. Leukemic polylactosaminoglycans are (a) shorter, (b) more highly sialylated and contain fully sialylated, tetrasialosyl polylactosaminoglycans, (c) are less fucosylated at C-3 of N-acetylglucosamine of polylactosaminyl side chains, and (d) contain a significant amount of sialyl Lex, NeuNAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4(Fuc alpha 1----3)GlcNAc beta 1----3, structure.

https://openalex.org/W1524801195,"Transducin, the guanyl nucleotide-binding regulatory protein of retinal rod outer segments that couples the photon receptor, rhodopsin, with the light-activated cGMP phosphodiesterase, can be resolved into two functional components, T alpha and T beta gamma. T alpha (39 kDa), which is [32P]ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin and [32P]NAD in rod outer segments and in purified transducin, was also labeled by the toxin after separation from T beta gamma (36 kDa and approximately 10 kDa); neither component of T beta gamma was a pertussis toxin substrate. Labeling of T alpha was enhanced by T beta gamma and was maximal at approximately 1:1 molar ratio of T alpha : T beta gamma. Limited proteolysis by trypsin of T alpha in the presence of guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) resulted in the sequential appearance of proteins of 38 and 32 kDa. The amino terminus of both 38- and 32-kDa proteins was leucine, whereas that of T alpha could not be identified and was assumed to be blocked. The 32-kDa peptide was not a pertussis toxin substrate. Labeling of the 38-kDa protein was poor and was not enhanced by T beta gamma. Trypsin treatment of [32P]ADP-ribosyl-T alpha produced a labeled 37-38-kDa doublet followed by appearance of radioactivity at the dye front. It appears, therefore, that, although the 38-kDa protein was poor toxin substrate, it contained the ADP-ribosylation site. Without rhodopsin, labeling of T alpha (in the presence of T beta gamma) was unaffected by Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), GTP, GDP, and guanosine 5'-O-(thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S) but was increased by ATP. When photolyzed rhodopsin and T beta gamma were present, Gpp(NH)p and GTP gamma S decreased [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. Thus, pertussis toxin-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation of T alpha was affected by nucleotides, rhodopsin and light in addition to T beta gamma. The amino terminus of T alpha, while it does not contain the pertussis toxin ADP-ribosylation site, appeared critical to its reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2060398967,"The transfer of the human gene for hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) into human bone marrow cells was accomplished by use of a retroviral vector. The cells were infected in vitro with a replication-incompetent murine retroviral vector that carried and expressed a mutant HPRT complementary DNA. The infected cells were superinfected with a helper virus and maintained in long-term culture. The production of progeny HPRT virus by the bone marrow cells was demonstrated with a colony formation assay on cultured HPRT-deficient, ouabain-resistant murine fibroblasts. Hematopoietic progenitor cells able to form colonies of granulocytes or macrophages (or both) in semisolid medium in the presence of colony stimulating factor were present in the nonadherent cell population. Colony forming units cloned in agar and subsequently cultured in liquid medium produced progeny HPRT virus, indicating infection of this class of hematopoietic progenitor cell."

One major product was isolated and identified in the perfusate as a new prostanoid. The structure of this metabolite was further confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and chemical methods to be 9 alpha,11 beta,15-L-trihydroxyprosta-5-cis, 13-trans-dienoic acid, namely (9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2). This new prostanoid was found to be an inhibitor of platelet aggregation and to cause constriction of canine coronary artery strips. These results suggested that on passage through the hepatic circulation exogenous PGD2 is converted to 9 alpha,11 beta-PGF2, the latter having a biological profile which differs from that of PGD2 and PGF2 alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1604063554,"Phosphorylation of chromosomal high mobility group (HMG) protein 14 by casein kinase II has been characterized. Two mol of 32P are incorporated per mol of bovine HMG 14. Kinetic analysis provided evidence for two distinct sites with apparent Km values of 14.5 and 134 microM and respective Vmax values of 0.17 and 0.68 mumol/min/mg casein kinase II. Tryptic peptide mapping identified two phosphorylated products, each with phosphoserine. Amino acid composition and sequence analysis demonstrate that the major high affinity phosphorylation site for casein kinase II is serine 89. This sequence located at the carboxyl-terminal of HMG 14 contains the primary sequence determinants for casein kinase II. On the basis of reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography and amino acid analysis, HMG 14, serine 99 represents the low affinity phosphorylation site."
https://openalex.org/W1576178880,"The phosphorylation of a highly purified aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex from rabbit reticulocytes by the cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinase, casein kinase I, has been examined, and the effects of phosphorylation on the synthetase activities were determined. The synthetase complex, purified as described (Kellermann, O., Tonetti, H., Brevet, A., Mirande, M., Pailliez, J.-P., and Waller, J.-P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11041-11048), contains seven aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and four unidentified proteins and is free of endogenous protein kinase activity. Incubation of the complex with casein kinase I in the presence of ATP results in the phosphorylation of four synthetases, namely, glutamyl-, isoleucyl-, methionyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases. Phosphorylation by casein kinase I alters binding of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex to tRNA-Sepharose. The phosphorylated synthetase complex elutes from tRNA-Sepharose at 190 mM NaCl, while the nonphosphorylated complex elutes at 275 mM NaCl. Phosphorylation by casein kinase I results in a significant inhibition of aminoacylation by the glutamyl-, isoleucyl-, methionyl-, and lysyl-tRNA synthetases; the activities of the nonphosphorylated synthetases remain unchanged. These data indicate that phosphorylation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases in the high molecular weight complex alters the activities of these enzymes. One of the unidentified proteins present in the complex (Mr 37,000) is also highly phosphorylated by casein kinase I. From a comparison of the properties and phosphopeptide pattern of this protein with that of casein kinase I, it appears that the Mr 37,000 protein in the synthetase complex is an inactive form of casein kinase I. This observation provides further evidence for a physiological role for casein kinase I in regulating synthetase activities."

https://openalex.org/W1529898466,"We have compared the rates of alpha- and beta-globin gene transcription with the rates of mature globin mRNA appearance in the cytoplasm during the course of chemically induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells by in vivo pulse-labeling experiments. The absolute rates for both processes were determined by simultaneously measuring incorporation into globin-specific transcripts and into the cellular nucleotide pool. The latter measurements provide a determination of the absolute rate of total RNA synthesis which declines during differentiation. Transcription from the beta major and beta minor globin genes was measured separately by hybridization to cloned DNA sequences from a region of the second intron which is highly divergent in the two genes. The results show that, during dimethyl sulfoxide-stimulated differentiation, transcription of alpha and beta major globin increases 15-25-fold, whereas beta minor globin transcription is not increased. Furthermore, in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, the absolute rates of globin transcription are about equal to the rate of appearance of mature mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm, indicating highly efficient processing of nuclear globin transcripts to mature mRNA before and after differentiation. The results indicate that dimethyl sulfoxide-induced accumulation of globin mRNA during differentiation is controlled almost entirely at the transcriptional level."

https://openalex.org/W1547799855,"The cell-free, nerve growth factor-sensitive incorporation of radioactive phosphate into a 100,000-dalton protein (Nsp100), observed in a previous study (End,D., Tolson, N., Hashimoto, S., and Guroff, G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6549-6555), has been characterized and the system fractionated. It is shown here that the decrease in incorporation due to treatment of the cells with nerve growth factor is transient, even in the continued presence of nerve growth factor. The decrease in radioactive phosphate incorporation is due to an inhibition of phosphorylation, not to a stimulation of a dephosphorylation. Evidence is presented to suggest that no soluble cofactors are needed for the phosphorylation and no soluble second messengers are responsible for the inhibition. It is demonstrated that the phosphorylation requires divalent cations; both Mg2+ and Mn2+ are effective in this regard. ATP is the preferred phosphate donor, the phosphorylation is maximal at pH values between 5 and 6, and Na+, K+, and Zn2+ are rather specific inhibitors. The system has been partially purified and the resolved components have been used to show that the kinase and the substrate are separate molecules, that the kinase, not the substrate, is the heat-labile portion, and that the kinase has a molecular weight of 110,000-130,000. Finally, evidence is presented to indicate that the kinase, not the substrate, is the component responsible for the decrease in phosphorylation seen after treatment of the cells with nerve growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1569749400,"The biosynthesis of the major human red cell sialoglycoprotein, glycophorin A, was studied in the erythroleukemia cell line K562 with emphasis on O-glycosylation. The cells were pulse-chase labeled with [35S] methionine, and either directly immune precipitated with anti-glycophorin A antiserum or detergent-solubilized extracts first passed through columns containing the N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin from Helix pomatia or the glucose/mannose specific lectin from lentil beans. From the sugar-eluted fractions anti-glycophorin A antiserum was used to identify precursor molecules. After 5 min of labeling the first glycophorin A precursors were seen. The largest had an apparent molecular weight of 37,000, and bound to lentil lectin-Sepharose, but not to H. pomatia lectin-Sepharose. The lentil lectin-reactive glycophorin A molecules increased to Mr = 39,000 during chase and obtained sialic acids after 9 min of chase reflecting terminal N- and O-glycosylation. After 5-6 min of labeling two H. pomatia-interacting glycophorin A precursors with apparent molecular weights of 24,000 and 30,000 were obtained. These did not bind to lentil lectin-Sepharose. During chase also these molecules increased in size to Mr = 39,000. The immune precipitation of all antiglycophorin A-reactive precursor molecules was inhibited by purified red cell glycophorin A. The carboxylic ionophore, monensin, caused the accumulation of incompletely O-glycosylated glycophorin A molecules, which bound to H. pomatia lectin-Sepharose. These were degraded by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H reflecting incomplete processing of the N-glycosidic oligosaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1580304066,"We have monitored, during the dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-induced differentiation of MEL cells, the accumulation of mRNAs encoding two enzymes of the heme biosynthetic pathway, namely porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase. Our results demonstrate that the induction of these two enzymes is accounted for by a coordinate increase in their corresponding mRNAs, as estimated by hybridization with specific cloned cDNA probes. These events occur early during the differentiation process and precede the accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs. Blocking the heme biosynthetic pathway with succinylacetone does not appear to modify the Me2SO-mediated increase of porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase mRNAs although succinylacetone has been shown to prevent the induction of immunoreactive porphobilinogen deaminase as well as its enzymatic activity (Beaumont, C., Deybach, J.

Heme depletion resulting from the presence of succinylacetone in the culture medium reduces the extent of the Me2SO-mediated accumulation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs, and this effect is reversed by the addition of 10 microM exogenous hemin. Although the presence of succinylacetone prevents hemoglobinization of MEL cells, it does not prevent MEL cells from losing their proliferative capacity when treated with Me2SO."
https://openalex.org/W2208392588,"Physical and kinetic studies have been used to explore hysteretic effects that are observed in rhodanese catalysis at pH 5 and also at neutral pH when the ionic strength of the medium is high. Experiments that involve observation of changes in intrinsic protein fluorescence of the enzyme and kinetic investigation of its interactions with product thiocyanate anion at pH 5 have implicated enzyme isomerization as the cause of hysteresis. Taken all together, the data indicate that the conformations of enzyme forms in the catalytic cycle are dynamically determined, depending on the relative rates of conformational relaxation and catalysis as influenced by the concentrations of substrates and products."
https://openalex.org/W1485061321,"A new purification scheme for both prolactin and growth hormone from bovine pituitaries has been developed which avoids the use of potentially damaging solution conditions. Both hormones were greater than 95% pure as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and had specific activities similar to or greater than standard samples of the same hormone as judged by several bioassays. Small single crystals of bovine growth hormone were obtained by vapor diffusion techniques. Examination of these crystals by x-ray diffraction, using the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source, showed that they were well ordered, and exhibited diffraction to 2.8-A resolution on still photographs. Precession and oscillation photographs showed that they belonged to the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) (or P2(1)2(1)2) with unit cell dimensions a = 219 A, b = 51.9 A, c = 68.9 A. The density of the crystals was 1.19 +/- 0.02 g/ml from which the presence of eight 45,000-dalton dimers/unit cell was deduced. The protein content of the crystals was shown by isoelectric focusing to be identical to that of purified growth hormone in solution. These crystals appear suitable for use in the x-ray structure determination of bovine growth hormone to at least 3.2-A resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1623738703,"Abstract Cultured Friend cells can be induced by dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and several other agents to mature along the erythroid pathway. Evidence has been presented that an increase in Ca2+ influx is an early and necessary prelude to the commitment to maturation by these cells (Levenson, R., Housman, D., and Cantley, L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 5948-5952). The simplest hypothesis supporting all the available data is that Me2SO and other inducers elevate the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. We have now measured cytosolic Ca2+ using the fluorescent indicator quin-2, and find, contrary to expectation, a small decrease upon treatment of cells with Me2SO. Cytosolic Ca2+ was increased by raising the Ca2+ in the medium, but was not dramatically altered by addition of ouabain or monensin or by incubation in Na+-free medium. Measurement of total cell Ca2+ by a triple-labeling technique using 3H2O and 125I-albumin to determine cell water and extracellular space, respectively, revealed no significant change upon treatment with Me2SO for up to 40 h. A decrease in the initial rate of 45Ca2+ influx was observed in Me2SO-treated cells, when measured at 4 degrees C. These data do not support the hypothesis that an increase in cell Ca2+ is necessary for the induction of Friend cell differentiation or that Na+/Ca2+ exchange is a significant regulator of cytosolic Ca2+ in Friend cells."
https://openalex.org/W1498600287,"A decrease in Na+/K+-pump activity is an early event of Friend murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cell differentiation along the erythroid pathway. This decreased Na+/K+-pump activity has been proposed to be an essential step in differentiation which would cause a rise in intracellular Na+ concentration and then, by means of Na+/Ca2+ exchange, an increase in intracellular Ca2+. An increase in intracellular Ca2+ has been proposed to be essential for induction of differentiation. A critical prediction of this Na+-Ca2+ hypothesis is the rise in intracellular Na+. To test this prediction we have measured intracellular Na+ using a novel triple isotope method involving 3H2O, [14C]sucrose, and 22Na to measure total water, extracellular fluid, and Na+, respectively. 22Na equilibration occurred in less than 10 min. In uninduced cells, intracellular Na+ was 15.2 +/- 2.2 mM (S.D., n = 22); after induction for 14-16 h with dimethyl sulfoxide, intracellular Na+ decreased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to 8.4 +/- 1.4 mM (n = 21). The time course of the decline in intracellular Na+ paralleled that of the decrease in the Na+/K+-pump activity. These results are in direct contradiction to the Na+-Ca2+ hypothesis and suggest that observed changes in Na+/K+-pump activity can be explained solely on the basis of changes in intracellular Na+. The drop in intracellular Na+ is due to a decrease in Na+ influx. We suggest, however, that the decrease in the Na+ influx is not itself an essential event of differentiation, but may be induced by a change in the flux of another ion coupled to Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2036202490,"Mechanisms that affect the transcription of the c-myc oncogene take part in the development of B-cell neoplasias such as Burkitt's lymphoma. Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, which express only the translocated c-myc oncogene, were hybridized with human lymphoblastoid cells, which express the normal c-myc gene; the hybrids were phenotypically lymphoblastoid and expressed both the translocated and the normal c-myc gene. This result contrasts with the findings that the decapitated c-myc gene, translocated to an immunoglobulin switch mu or alpha region, is transcriptionally silent in lymphoblastoid hybrids. Thus, there may be at least two distinct enhancer-like elements capable of deregulating c-myc transcription in lymphomas and leukemias with t(8;14) chromosome translocations. In addition, since the Daudi X lymphoblastoid hybrids express both the translocated and the normal c-myc gene, the c-myc gene product does not autoregulate c-myc transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1503382700,"A protein kinase system with unusual characteristics was noted in extracts of HL-60 cells using endogenous proteins as substrates. This system exhibited a cation preference for manganese at an optimal concentration of 0.5 mM. Moderate activity was detectable with magnesium at an optimal concentration of 5.0 mM, but calcium was inactive. Activity was markedly stimulated by phospholipid, with phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol exhibiting greater activity than phosphatidylserine. In isolated plasma membranes, the major substrate of this system was a 73-kDa protein, while cytoplasmic extracts exhibited larger amounts of a 42-kDa substrate. 73-kDa phosphorylating activity of membranes was comparably active at 0 and 31 degrees C, although in cytosol activity was greater at 31 degrees C. No 73-kDa protein phosphorylation was observed in the presence of Ca2+, Mg2+, and phosphatidylserine. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the 73-kD band revealed phosphothreonine and phosphoserine. The 42-kDa substrate was distinguishable from actin by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, which disclosed that both major substrates were highly basic in the isoelectric focusing dimension. Protamine and histones (H2B greater than H1 greater than H3) exhibited phospholipid-stimulated phosphorylation in the presence of Mn2+, but phosvitin, casein, and vinculin were not substrates. High levels of phosphorylative activity involving the 73-kDa substrate were noted in nuclear extracts. Complex patterns of increase of this activity were noted in both cytosol and nuclear extracts following induction of differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide, retinoic acid, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This study thus demonstrated the presence of a previously undescribed type of protein kinase activity which exhibited alterations during leukemic cellular differentiation."

Molybdenum-iron cluster (a subcomponent of FeMo cofactor) and tetrathiomolybdate inhibited FeMo cofactor activation of inactive nitrogenase component I in extracts of Azotobacter vinelandii and Klebsiella pneumoniae mutant strains defective in the biosynthesis of FeMo cofactor. Addition of tetrathiotungstate, the tungsten analog of tetrathiomolybdate, to the mutant extracts had no significant inhibitory effect on subsequent activation by FeMo cofactor."
https://openalex.org/W1555401613,"During differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells, adult beta-globin gene chromatin acquires site-specific, DNase I hypersensitivity and an increased sensitivity in the globin gene region toward micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion. The relationship of these changes in chromatin structure to globin gene activation and to cellular commitment events has been studied. Imidazole, which blocks globin gene transcription during induction does not affect the terminal differentiation of the cells nor does it prevent the acquisition of DNAse I hypersensitivity. The formation of the inducible DNase I-hypersensitive site near the globin gene accompanies the developmental events which lead to cellular differentiation independent of the transcription process. The increased MNase sensitivity of the adult beta-globin gene region, normally preceded by the acquisition of 5‘ DNase I hypersensitivity, was blocked by the addition of imidazole prior to but not after globin gene activation. The enhanced MNase sensitivity was not abolished by the addition of actinomycin D and, thus, reflects a part of chromatin alterations that define potential for transcription. Therefore, there is a sequential series of chromatin alterations in the globin gene region associated with murine erythroleukemia cell differentiation. The appearance of the inducible 5‘ DNase I-hypersensitive site precedes the onset of globin gene transcription and is strongly correlated with commitment events. The enhanced MNase sensitivity is closely related to globin gene transcription, but it is not a consequence of the transcription process. In addition, the commitment of cells to terminal differentiation is dissociable from the stimulation of globin gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1536779780,"Incorporation of radioactive sulfate into exogenous glycopeptides and glycoproteins from adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phospho[35S]sulfate was studied with the microsomal fraction of the uterine endometrium of rabbits. A high molecular weight (Mr greater than 750,000) glycopeptide fraction from rat adenocarcinoma was found to be active as substrate, while several other glycoproteins were not. The rate of incorporation of sulfate was almost proportional to the concentration of glycopeptide substrate, the quantity of microsomal fraction, and the length of the incubation period. Cellulose acetate membrane electrophoresis demonstrated that radioactivity was incorporated into the glycopeptide fraction. The radioactive glycopeptide was excluded from a Sephadex G-50 column, but the 35S radioactivity and oligosaccharides were found in the retarded fractions after treatment with alkali in the absence of sodium borohydride. These observations indicated the presence of an enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate residue from adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-phosphosulfate into the carbohydrate units attached to the polypeptide via O-glycosidic linkage. The sulfotransferase activity was measured with the microsomal fractions from the animals which had been treated with female sex hormones. As a result, it was found that estrogen enhances the activity and that progesterone suppresses the effect of estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1550809021,"Esterase 1, a well-characterized mouse plasma protein of unknown function, has activity against a wide range of ester substrates including beta-alanine nitrophenyl esters and 17 beta-esters of estradiol. In this article, we report that esterase 1 is also responsible for a majority of the phorbol-12-ester hydrolase activity in mouse plasma. Incubation of homogeneous esterase 1 with 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) at either 4 or 37 degrees C for up to 18 h yielded phorbol 13 alpha-acetate as the only hydrolysis product. Specific polyclonal antibodies to esterase 1 inhibited 95% of PMA hydrolysis by a purified esterase 1 preparation and 65% of PMA hydrolysis by mouse plasma. Perfused mouse liver homogenates contain two distinct phorbol diester hydrolases with apparent molecular masses of 65 kDa and 56 kDa, respectively. The 65-kDa protein appears to be immunologically identical to the plasma enzyme, while the 56-kDa protein, found in liver but not in plasma, is immunologically distinct. Phorbol 12-myristate, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, and PMA were found to be competitive inhibitors of the beta-alanine-nitrophenyl esterase activity of esterase 1 with Ki values of approximately 7 microM. Phorbol 13-acetate and phorbol itself were less effective with Ki values of 37 and 140 microM, respectively. Sodium salts of valeric and myristic acids did not inhibit at 10 microM. The above results indicate that efficient substrate binding requires a phorbol 12-ester. Similar results were obtained with estradiol 17 beta-valerate which is a better substrate for esterase 1 than is PMA. Our results strongly suggest that esterase 1 and a recently described phorbol ester hydrolase isolated from mouse serum (Saito, M., and Egawa, K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 5821-5826) are the same and are immunologically and kinetically distinct from the 56-kDa phorbol 12-ester hydrolase in mouse liver."
https://openalex.org/W1514567900,"Tetracyanonickelate (Ni(CN)4(2-)) was used as a probe for the active site of sulfur-free rhodanese (E) in physical and kinetic studies. Ni(CN)4(2-) quenches the intrinsic fluorescence as well as the fluorescence of enzyme-bound 2-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (2,8-ANS), an inhibitor that is competitive with respect to thiosulfate. A facile binding method based on centrifugation was developed to study Ni(CN)4(2-) binding to E. Binding studies performed using either of the electrophoretic variants A and B, fractionated by DE52 column chromatography, showed one high affinity Ni(CN)4(2-)-binding site in each species and additional weak sites on the more electropositive form A. The high affinity Ni(CN)4(2-) binding was corroborated by ultrafiltration binding (Kd = 3.95 +/- 0.35 microM), titration of intrinsic fluorescence (Kd = 1.8 +/- 0.11 microM), and displacement of enzyme-bound 2,8-ANS (Kd = 1.9 +/- 1.1 microM). A nonlinear least squares analysis of kinetic data collected under conditions used for the binding studies gave a Ni(CN)4(2-) inhibition constant of 21 microM. It is concluded that Ni(CN)4(2-) binds to sulfur-free rhodanese in solution near the active site as has been shown in x-ray crystal studies (Lijk, L. J., Kalk, K. H., Brandenburger, N. P., and Hol, W. G. J. (1983) Biochemistry 22, 2952-2957). In keeping with recent suggestions that the conformational state of the enzyme is dynamically determined, the discrepancy between Ni(CN)4(2-) affinity as determined by physical methods and that by kinetic methods suggests that Ni(CN)4(2-) may be able to distinguish the conformation of the working enzyme from those of the idle forms."
https://openalex.org/W1534331994,"Circular dichroism (CD) spectra and UV absorption spectra of two obligatory intermediates in rhodanese catalysis were compared. A broad CD band between 250 and 287 nm increased in a manner stoichiometrically related to the content of enzyme-bound persulfide. Titration of a sample of sulfur-substituted rhodanese (ES) with either cyanide or sulfite gave a stoichiometry that is consistent with one persulfide/molecule of rhodanese (Mr = 33,000). This result agrees with that determined by x-ray crystallography and a method based on quenching of intrinsic fluorescence. Cyanolysis of the persulfide in ES is accompanied by a decrease of UV absorption in the region between 250 and 300 nm. Cyanide titrations followed by the change in absorbance at 263, 272, and 292 nm gave the expected stoichiometry. The magnitude of the difference between the far UV-CD spectra of E and ES found here is smaller than reported previously. This variability suggests that the differences in the secondary structure of these intermediates may not be obligatorily related to the cyanolysis of the persulfide. This view is compatible with recent evidence which suggested that E and ES may be made different by structural relaxation events that occur outside of the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, the methods developed here will be useful in studies on the stability of the catalytic persulfide that has been suggested to be central in the mechanism of several enzymes important in sulfur metabolism."
