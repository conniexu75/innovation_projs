The study, which includes projections of the burden through the year 2020, uses the disability-adjusted life year as a composite measure of years of life lost due to premature mortality and years lived with disability. Future patterns of death and disability are likely to change dramatically because of aging of the world's population, the epidemic of tobacco-related disease, the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, and the likely reduction in death rates from communicable diseases in children."

The genes encoding this specific class of K+ channels have not been functionally identified. This report shows that a single messenger RNA transcript from the Arabidopsis thaliana KAT1 complementary DNA confers the functional expression of a hyperpolarization-activated K+ channel in Xenopus oocytes. The channels encoded by KAT1 are highly selective for K+ over other monovalent cations, are blocked by tetraethylammonium and barium, and have a single channel conductance of 28 +/- 7 picosiemens with 118 millimolar K+ in the bathing solution. These functional characteristics, typical of inward-rectifying K+ channels in eukaryotic cells, demonstrate that KAT1 encodes an inward-rectifying K+ channel."

https://openalex.org/W2042626002,"SoxR protein is a redox-responsive transcription factor that governs a regulon of oxidative stress and antibiotic resistance genes in Escherichia coli. Purified SoxR contains oxidized [2Fe-2S] clusters and stimulates in vitro transcription of its target gene soxS up to 100-fold. SoxR transcriptional activity, but not DNA binding, is completely dependent on the [2Fe-2S] clusters; apo-SoxR prepared in vitro binds the soxS promoter with unchanged affinity but does not have transcription activity. Thus, modulation of the SoxR [2Fe-2S] clusters was proposed to control the protein's function in transcription. Here, we provide evidence that SoxR with reduced [2Fe-2S] clusters is inactive. Redox titration of purified SoxR revealed a midpoint potential of −285 ± 10 mV (pH 7.6). In vitro transcription assays showed that SoxR was inactivated when the [2Fe-2S] cluster was reduced (−380 mV), and full activity was restored upon reoxidation (+100 mV). The results suggest that one-electron oxidation and reduction of the [2Fe-2S] cluster regulate SoxR transcriptional activity."

The Rad51 protein is thought to be a yeast analogue of the Eschericia coli recA gene product and catalyzes strand exchange between homologous single- and double-stranded DNAs in vitro. RAD54 exhibits homologies to several known ATPases and is a member of the SWI2/MOT1 family. We show here that the Rad54 protein interacts with the Rad51 protein in vivo and in vitro and that the NH2-terminal 115 residues of the Rad54 protein are necessary for this interaction.

INTRODUCTIONThe RAD52 epistasis group includes genes involved in homologous recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations in these genes result in phenotypes that include an inability to repair double-stranded breaks, as well as defects in mitotic and meiotic recombination (1Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L.

The Rad51, Rad55, and Rad57 proteins show considerable homology to the Eschericia coli RecA protein, the paradigmatic prokaryotic strand transferase.

Furthermore, experiments from the Berg (Stanford University School of Medicine) and Symington (Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons) laboratories demonstrated that Rad51 protein binds to the Rad55 protein in vivo, which in turn interacts with Rad57 protein (10Hays S.L.

The discovery of a Rad54-Rad51 protein interaction provides further support for the existence of a “protein machine” for mitotic recombination in yeast and raises the possibility that the Rad54 protein could play a direct role in strand exchange.DISCUSSIONSeveral genetic and biochemical techniques, including the two-hybrid system, protein affinity chromatography, and Far-Western blotting, have been employed to demonstrate a direct interaction between the yeast Rad51 and Rad54 recombination proteins. There is growing evidence that mitotic recombination in yeast is catalyzed by a multiprotein complex containing several RAD gene products, including Rad51, Rad52, Rad55, Rad57, and probably many other factors as well. Given the results reported here, and the fact that the RAD51 and RAD54 genes have been shown to be epistatic (24Rattray A.J. Symington L.S. Genetics. 1995; 139: 45-56Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems very likely that the Rad54 protein is also an integral part of this putative “recombinosome.”The function of the Rad54 protein in recombination is unknown and the protein has yet to be purified and characterized biochemically. It is homologous to a number of ATPases and appears to be a member of a family that includes Swi2/Snf2 (25Peterson C.L. Herskowitz I.

The Swi-Snf complex is thought to remodel chromatin structure and may influence transcription factor binding (32Imbalzano A.N. Kwon H. Green M.R. Kingston R.E.

Nature. 1994; 370: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). MOT1 protein has been shown to be a TATA-binding protein-associated factor that disrupts TATA-binding protein-DNA complexes in an ATP-dependent fashion. This raises the exciting possibility that Rad54 may be involved in allowing the recombination machinery to access the DNA in a histone-occluded substrate. Indeed, Haber and colleagues (34Sugawara N. Ivanov E.L. Fishman-Lobell Ray B.L. Wu X. Haber J.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) have shown that the Rad54 protein is required for an early step in mitotic recombination in vivo when one of the DNA partners is part of a relatively inaccessible chromatin structure (34Sugawara N. Ivanov E.L. Fishman-Lobell Ray B.L. Wu X. Haber J.E. Nature. 1995; 373: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, Rad54 protein is not required when the DNA is carried on a plasmid and is therefore part of a more accessible chromatin structure.Alternatively, it has been suggested that Rad54 protein might be a DNA helicase.

https://openalex.org/W1992763171,"The Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins plays important roles in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization and cell growth. Activation of these GTPases involves the replacement of bound GDP with GTP, a process catalyzed by the Dbl-like guanine-nucleotide exchange factors, all of which seem to share a putative catalytic motif termed the Dbl homology (DH) domain, followed by a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Here we have examined the role of a Dbl-like molecule, the faciogenital dysplasia gene product (FGD1), which when mutated in its Dbl homology domain, cosegregates with the developmental disease Aarskog-Scott syndrome. We report that a polypeptide of FGD1 encompassing the DH and PH domains can bind specifically to the Rho family GTPase Cdc42Hs and stimulates the GDP-GTP exchange of the isoprenylated form of Cdc42Hs. Microinjection of this FGD1 polypeptide into Swiss 3T3 fibroblast cells induces the formation of peripheral actin microspikes, similar to that previously observed when cells were injected with a constitutively active form of Cdc42Hs. This effect of FGD1 on actin organization is readily inhibited by coinjection of a dominant-negative mutant of Cdc42Hs. Examination of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the FGD1 fragment revealed that similar to cells expressing Dbl, two independent elements downstream of Cdc42Hs, the Jun NH2-terminal kinase and the p70 S6 kinase, became activated. Hence, our results indicate that FGD1, through its DH and PH domains, acts as a Cdc42Hs-specific guanine-nucleotide exchange factor and suggest that the Cdc42Hs GTPase may have a role in mammalian development.

The antigen of this monoclonal antibody was formed by peroxidation of phosphatidylcholine (PC), and the antigenic oxidized PC (OxPC) derivatives are thought to form complexes with polypeptides including apolipoproteins. OxLDL was measured by a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibody and anti-human apolipoprotein B antibody, in which antigenic OxPC competed with OxLDL. When antigenic activities of PC analogs were tested by the competition assay, 1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxononanoyl) PC (9-CHO PC) and the hydroperoxide of egg PC potently inhibited the detection of OxLDL. 1-Palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl PC was oxidized with ferrous ion and ascorbic acid, and the antigenic products were purified from the OxPC extracts on high pressure liquid chromatography columns and subsequently analyzed by laser desorption mass spectrometry. Molecular weight determination and retention times of high pressure liquid chromatography suggest that one of these products was 9-CHO PC. Other products are thought to be 8-carbon aldehyde, dihydroxy, and ketohydroxy derivatives of PC.

Lavi S. Berliner J.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 601-607PubMed Google Scholar). However, the active components in OxLDL and the mechanism by which these cellular responses are induced are not yet understood.Upon oxidation of LDL, apolipoprotein B (apoB) is modified by a wide variety of oxidative products of LDL lipids. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal, well known aldehyde-containing products of lipid peroxidation, were detected in OxLDL and atherosclerotic lesions (14Ylä-Herttuala S. Palinski W.

Invest. 1991; 87: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Increased mobility on agarose gel electrophoresis as well as a marked reduction in lysine residues suggested that these peroxidation products modified the lysine residues (17Zhang H. Yang Y. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5535-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Harduin P. Tailleux A. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 919-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aggregation of LDL as well as fragmentation of apoB have been demonstrated (18Harduin P. Tailleux A. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 919-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, little has been clarified on the structure of OxLDL, partly due to the technical difficulties encountered when analyzing heterogeneous complexes of lipids and the huge apoB protein.We have shown in previous studies that apoB is modified by oxidized products of phosphatidylcholine (PC) as demonstrated by an anti-OxLDL monoclonal antibody, FOH1a/DLH3 (19Itabe H. Takeshima E. Iwasaki H. Kimura J. Yoshida Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15274-15279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody was produced by immunizing against homogenates of human atheroma and selecting the hybridomas by reactivity to copper-induced OxLDL. The antibody recognizes oxidized products of PC in OxLDL and does not react to MDA-treated LDL, acetylated LDL, or native LDL. Moreover, immunohistochemical studies showed a colocalization of the antigenic materials of this antibody with macrophage-derived foam cells in human atherosclerotic lesions. In the present study, we isolated and characterized the antigenic OxPC products in order to investigate the molecular basis of oxidative modification of LDL. We found that this antibody reacted to several OxPC products including aldehyde derivatives of PC that modify polypeptides.DISCUSSIONIn our previous study, we obtained a unique anti-OxLDL monoclonal antibody that heavily stained macrophage-derived foam cells in human atherosclerotic lesions (19Itabe H. Takeshima E. Iwasaki H. Kimura J. Yoshida Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15274-15279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is very important to identify which molecules the antibody reacts with, since this would be an important aid to identifying the modified structures of OxLDL and the metabolic fate of OxLDL in foam cells. In the present study, we found that several PC species were reactive to the antibody including those capable of forming complexes with polypeptides.It is very difficult to define the exact structure of the epitope, since not only 9-CHO PC but also egg PCOOH and other several OxPC products reacted with the antibody. Sandwich ELISA detection of the 9-CHO PC-peptide complex and LDL mixed with 9-CHO PC competed with egg PCOOH (data not shown), suggesting that these molecules share the structure required for antigen recognition and that the recognition is not likely to specific for a certain functional group at sn-2 position. The inhibition of OxLDL binding to the antibody by high doses of choline or phosphocholine suggested that the choline head group was required for antigen recognition (20Itabe H. Yamamoto H. Imanaka T. Shimamura K. Uchiyama H. Kimura J. Sanaka T. Hata Y. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smaller analogs with similar structures, lyso-PC, PAF, and 5-COOH PC, moderately bound to the antibody. It is likely that the antibody has some selectivity to certain OxPC products, since the specific activities of the purified peaks IIIa, IIIb, and IV (approximately 20 units/nmol) were significantly higher than that of lyso-PC (approximately 0.5 unit/nmol). Taken together, recognition of OxPC products by this antibody seems to require a lyso-PC backbone, hydrophilic functions on the sn-2 acyl chain, and a short or straight sn-2-chain. The antibody recognizes OxPC-polypeptide complexes as well as the free forms of these OxPC products, probably due to the antibody's rather broad specificity. The PCOOH from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC was a rather poor antigen. A large kink at the double bond in the oleate moiety of the PCOOH might cause a steric interference between the tail of the acyl chain and the antibody.It is well known that cleavage of lipid hydroperoxides leads to aldehyde formation during lipid peroxidation. Therefore, 9-CHO PC and 5-CHO PC were expected to be formed from PC molecules containing linoleic acid and arachidonic acid, respectively. Both of these aldehyde-containing PCs were reactive to the monoclonal antibody (see Fig. 1 and “Results”). In this study we identified 9-CHO PC as one of the antigenic determinants of this antibody. In addition, we identified the formation of another aldehyde derivative, 8-CHO-PC, which is one carbon shorter than 9-CHO PC, from palmitoyl-linoleoyl PC as an antigenic product. During extensive oxidation of methyl linoleate, 8-carbon aldehyde was produced (32Frankel E.N. Neff W.E. Selke E. Lipids. 1981; 16: 279-285Crossref Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Recently Kamido et al. reported the formation of 8-CHO PC and 8-CHO cholesterylester as well as 9-CHO counterparts (33Kamido H. Kuksis A. Marai L. Myher J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1876-1886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The carbon atom at position 8 could be reactive after the carbon 13 is substituted with hydroxy or hydroperoxy group. The reaction mechanism involved in producing an 8-carbon chain derivative, however, is not fully understood.The observed molecular weights of the antigenic products suggest several possible structures. The molecular weight of peak IIa was 790, which is 32 higher than that of the original PC molecule, suggesting that this may be PCOOH or a dihydroxy-PC derivative. The possibility that it is PCOOH is unlikely, since the retention time of peak IIa (30 min) on the reversed phase HPLC was much shorter than that of PCOOH. The PCOOH standards prepared from egg PC and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl PC were 41 and 42 min, respectively. A previous study in which the oxidation products of fatty acids were analyzed extensively reported the production of 9,14-dihydroxydienoyl and 8,13-dihydroxydienoyl derivatives during autoxidation of linoleic acid (34Hamberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 752: 353-356Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Peaks I and IIb, with a molecular weight of 788, 30 higher than the original PC, may be ketohydroxydienoyl PC or a methoxy derivative of PC. However, the methoxy-PC is likely to elute even later than PCOOH on the reverse phase HPLC. Further study is needed to confirm the structures by identifying the functional groups.During oxidative modification of LDL, a variety of modifications are thought to take place such as a decrease in PC content and an increase in lyso-PC content, production of MDA and subsequent modification of the lysine residues of apoB, an increase in negative charge, aggregation and fragmentation of apoB, etc. (16Rosenfeld M.E. Khoo J.C. Miller E. Parthasarathy S. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 17Zhang H. Yang Y. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5535-5542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our present study, we found that radioactive BSA formed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after oxidative treatment of [14C]PC in the presence of BSA and that antigenic OxPC-peptide complexes were separated on an HPLC column. These data confirmed that the modification of proteins with OxPC takes place. It is possible that proteins modified by OxPC species such as 5, 8, or 9-CHO PC might be formed and accumulate in the lesions. It is reported that OxLDL was partially resistant to lysosomal hydrolysis, while acetylated LDL was effectively hydrolyzed (35Lougheed M. Zhang H. Steinbrecher U.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14519-14525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Roma P. Bernini F. Fogliatto R. Bertulli S.M. Nrgra S. Fumagalli R. Catapano A.L. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 819-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of apoB by OxPC may contribute to such changes in OxLDL metabolism. The foam cells in human atherosclerotic lesions were stained immunohistochemically by this monoclonal antibody (18Harduin P. Tailleux A. Lestavel S. Clavey V. Fruchart J.-C. Fievet C. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 919-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the distribution of apoB protein in atherosclerotic lesions is diffuse and not concentrated in foam cells (37Galis Z.S. Ghitescu L.D. Li Z. Alavi M. Moore S. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 624-638PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophage-derived foamy shaped cells in human gastric lipid islands were also positive in immunohistochemical study (38Kaiserling E. Heinle H. Itabe H. Takano T. Remmele W. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 369-374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Metabolic fates of OxPC and OxPC-protein complexes in atherosclerotic lesions are to be the subject of future investigation.Some OxPC products are biologically active; for example 5-CHO PC was isolated from oxidized PC with platelet-activating activity (39Stremler K.E. Stafforini D.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmermen G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 264: 5331-5334Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). PCs containing short chain dicarboxylic acids were isolated as PAF-like materials in bovine brain (40Tokumura A. Asai T. Takauchi K. Kamiyasu K. Ogawa T. Tsukatani H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1011-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) reported that OxLDL inhibited endothelial cell migration and this activity was recovered in the lipid extract of OxLDL. The activity to enhance monocyte binding to endothelial cells of minimally modified LDL was also recovered in a phospholipid fraction (11Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W.

Recently such activity of minimally modified LDL was shown to be diminished by treatment with PAF acetylhydrolase (42Watson A.D. Navab M. Hama S.Y. Prescott S.M. Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. La Du B.N. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Clin.

The active molecules in minimally modified LDL that had been inactivated by paraoxonase, an HDL-associated esterase, appeared to be oxidized products of PC containing multiple oxygen atoms (44Heery J.M. Kozak M. Stafforini D.M. Jones D.A. Zimmermen G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that the antigenic OxPC products, including aldehyde-containing ones, possess some biological functions concerned with pathological aspects of atherosclerosis. With a sensitive method for OxLDL measurement using this monoclonal antibody (20Itabe H. Yamamoto H. Imanaka T. Shimamura K. Uchiyama H. Kimura J. Sanaka T. Hata Y. Takano T. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 45-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have observed increased oxidation levels of plasma LDL in patients of cardiovascular diseases. 3J. Kimura, I. Michishita, K. Shimamura, H. Uchiyama, H. Itabe, and T. Takano, unpublished observation. It is clear that more work is necessary to clarify the exact structure of the antigenic OxPC products and define the epitope of the monoclonal antibody. This antibody that can detect modification of proteins with phosphatidylcholine derivatives, however, would be a useful tool for the further investigation of the involvement of oxidized lipids in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. INTRODUCTIONAtherosclerosis is a complex vascular disorder that can lead to more serious conditions such as myocardial infarction. Many biological factors are involved in the generation and progression of atherosclerosis, but a major factor in the early stages of atherosclerosis is known to be oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein (OxLDL), 1The abbreviations used are: OxLDLoxidized LDLLDLlow density lipoproteinapoBapolipoprotein BBSAbovine serum albuminMDAmalondialdehydePCphosphatidylcholineOxPCoxidized phosphatidylcholine5-CHO PC1-palmitoyl-2-(5-oxovaleroyl) phosphatidylcholine8-CHO PC1-palmitoyl-2-(8-oxooctanoyl) phosphatidylcholine9-CHO PC1-palmitoyl-2-(9-oxononanoyl) phosphatidylcholine5-COOH PC1-palmitoyl-2-glutaroyl phosphatidylcholinePCOOHphosphatidylcholine hydroperoxide(s); PMP70-C; 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein C-terminal synthetic peptideTLCthin layer chromatographyELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyRPreverse phasePBSphosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)PAFplatelet activating factor. which promotes foam cell formation (1Witztum J.L.

The formation of lipid-laden foam cells from macrophages has been demonstrated by incubation of OxLDL with macrophages in vitro (2Pataki M. Lusztig G. Robenek H. Arterioscler.

Although OxLDL provides excess amounts of lipids to macrophages, it may also affect atherogenesis due to induction of various cellular responses (4Palinski W. Rosenfeld M.E. Ylä-Herttuala S.

In Bordetella pertussis, a human respiratory pathogen, the infectious cycle of the organism is controlled by the BvgAS two-component system. BvgS has similarities to sensor and response regulator components and is an autophosphorylating kinase that phosphorylates BvgA. BvgA, a response regulator, is a DNA-binding protein that activates virulence gene transcription. Three phosphorylated BvgS domains, the transmitter, receiver, and C terminus, are essential for signal transduction. We now demonstrate that the BvgS transmitter is sufficient for autophosphorylation but is unable to phosphorylate the C terminus or BvgA. The BvgS receiver regulates several phenotypes: dephosphorylation of both the BvgS transmitter and C terminus as well as transfer of a phosphoryl group from the transmitter to the C terminus. Our results indicate that BvgAS signal transduction initiates with autophosphorylation of the transmitter followed by phosphotransfer to the receiver. The phosphorylated receiver can donate to the C terminus or to water. The phosphorylated C terminus is then able to transfer the phosphoryl group to BvgA.

The phosphorylated receiver can donate to the C terminus or to water. The phosphorylated C terminus is then able to transfer the phosphoryl group to BvgA. Virulence gene activation in Bordetella pertussis is mediated by the BvgAS two-component system (1Weiss A. Hewlett E.L. Myers G.A. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1983; 42: 33-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Weiss A.A. Hewlett E.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 661-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 3Aricò B. Miller J.F. Roy C.

Two-component systems use phosphorylation cascades to effect adaptive responses and typically contain sensor and response regulator components (6Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J. Silhavy T. Two-Component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). The sensor protein, which autophosphorylates at a conserved transmitter domain, is the initial site of signal processing. Phosphotransfer from the sensor protein is catalyzed by a conserved receiver domain in the response regulator. Responses such as transcriptional activation and protein-protein interaction are then mediated by the phosphorylated response regulator. BvgS autophosphorylates with the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP and can phosphorylate BvgA (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated BvgA has an increased affinity for bvg-activated promoters and is competent in an in vitro transcription assay (8Boucher P.E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Boucher P.E. Stibitz S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6486-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Steffen P. Goyard S. Ullmann A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although these properties of BvgS and BvgA fit well with the paradigm of two-component systems, BvgS employs a mechanism of BvgA phosphorylation that differs from the typical transmitter to receiver phosphotransfer reaction. As shown in Fig. 1, BvgS contains three domains that participate in the phosphorylation cascade: the transmitter, receiver, and C terminus (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The C terminus is specifically responsible for BvgA phosphorylation (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Mutational studies of BvgS indicated that His-729 of the transmitter is required for autophosphorylation and that Asp-1023 of the receiver is essential for phosphorylation of the C terminus. His-1172 of the C terminus is necessary for BvgA phosphorylation. These amino acids are all required in vivo for expression of bvg-activated genes (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Beier D. Schwarz B. Fuchs T.M. Gross R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 596-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although Asp-1023 of the BvgS receiver is essential for the phosphorylation cascade and virulence gene activation, the exact role of the receiver had not been determined (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The BvgS receiver could act as an autoinhibitory domain, with phosphorylation relieving inhibition of phosphotransfer from the BvgS transmitter to the C terminus. Mutation of Asp-1023, the proposed site of phosphorylation in the receiver, would therefore lock the receiver in an inhibitory state. Alternatively, the BvgS receiver could have a positive role in the phosphorelay, serving as a phosphorylated intermediate between the transmitter and C terminus. In this report, we demonstrate that the BvgS receiver exerts both positive and negative influences on the BvgAS phosphorelay. The BvgS receiver can directly transfer a phosphoryl group to the C terminus, but the receiver also mediates dephosphorylation of BvgS by removing phosphoryl groups from both the transmitter and C terminus. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) was utilized for protein overexpression. For quantitation of bvg activity, E. coli strain JFMC3 (MC4100 recA λfhaB-lacZYA) was employed (14Miller J.F. Roy C.R. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6345-6348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar); when necessary, medium was supplemented with antibiotics at concentrations of 100 μg/ml for ampicillin. β-galactosidase activities were determined with cells permeabilized with SDS/CHCl3 as described (13Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Except for where noted below, construction of all plasmids has been detailed elsewhere (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). pMU714, which contains bvgS with a precise deletion of the regions encoding the receiver and C terminus (BvgSΔRC), was constructed by deleting a 700-base pair BsrGI fragment from pMU677. pMU677 was created by inserting the oligomers DeRC-1 (5′-CTGTACATCTGAC-3′) and DeRC-2 (5′-GTCAGATGTACAG-3′) into the unique SnaBI site of pMU228. pMU228 is identical to pJM26 (14Miller J.F. Roy C.R. Falkow S. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6345-6348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) except that it contains a BsrGI site at the junction of the BvgS transmitter and receiver. Introduction of the mutations that created this site did not affect BvgS function in vivo (data not shown). The vector for overexpression of BvgSΔRC, pMU540, was created by inserting an NcoI fragment from pMU714 encoding a portion of the BvgS transmitter into pMU100 (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The maltose-binding protein-BvgS receiver (MBP-R) 1The abbreviations used are: MBP-Rmaltose-binding protein-BvgS receiverGSTglutathione S-transferaseATPγSadenosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate). plasmid, pMU542, was created by taking an NcoI (blunted by treatment with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase) and HindIII fragment from pHB50delC (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and inserting it into pMalc (New England Biolabs) that had been cut with HindIII and EcoRI (blunted with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase). maltose-binding protein-BvgS receiver glutathione S-transferase adenosine 5′-O(thiotriphosphate). All protein purification methods were as previously stated for ′BvgS (the cytoplasmic portion of BvgS; see Fig. 1) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions to ′BvgS (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). GST-′BvgS, GST-′BvgSΔRC, GST-′BvgSΔC, and MBP-R were purified from insoluble inclusion bodies, dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 7.2), and renatured in 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 50% glycerol. GST-R (the BvgS receiver) and GST-C (the BvgS C terminus) were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. For purification of phosphorylated proteins from ATP, phosphorylation reactions were performed as below except that GST-′BvgS derivatives were present at 1-3 μM and ATP was at 60 μM. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by the addition of 50 mM EDTA, and 50-100 μl of glutathione-agarose was added. After binding for 10 min on ice, the pelleted agarose was washed six times with 5 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline (10 mM buffered phosphate (pH 7.3), 120 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl). Proteins were eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM glutathione for 10 min on ice. The yield following purification was typically 25%. The MBP-R fusion was purified from ′BvgS and ATP by amylose-agarose affinity chromatography. The purification scheme was identical to glutathione-agarose purification methods except that the wash buffer was 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and the elution buffer was 20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 10 mM maltose. Purification yields of the MBP-R fusion were 10%. Phosphorylation assays were essentially as described before (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Except where otherwise indicated in the figure legends, BvgA and ′BvgS wild-type or mutant derivatives (GST-′BvgS, GST-′BvgSΔRC, and GST-′BvgSΔC) were present at 0.3 μM. GST-R and GST-C were present at 1 μM. The reaction buffer contained 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 30 μM ATP (specific activity, 0.30 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 × sample buffer (0.32 M Tris (pH 6.8), 40% glycerol, 0.1 M EDTA (pH 8.0), 8% SDS, 0.4 M dithiothreitol) and heated to 55°C for 5 min. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to an Immobilon membrane (Millipore Corp.). In the case of samples that were analyzed by thin layer chromatography, reactions were terminated by the addition of 50 mM EDTA. As described by Hess et al. (15Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Matsumara P. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7609-7613Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), thin layer chromatography was utilized for resolving phosphorylated proteins from ATP and inorganic phosphate. Reactions were normalized to standards by cpm and then spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate (Brinkmann) and resolved with 0.8 M LiCl and 0.8 M acetic acid. The polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate was dried and wrapped in polyvinyl chloride before autoradiography. Multiple BvgS domains are involved in the BvgAS phosphorylation cascade (Fig. 1; Refs. 7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar and 11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). While the phenotypes of mutations indicated a requirement for the BvgS receiver in vivo, the contribution of this domain to the phosphorelay was unknown (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 12Beier D. Schwarz B. Fuchs T.M. Gross R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 596-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We speculated that the receiver might mediate dephosphorylation of BvgS, since the receiver had been shown to dephosphorylate the isolated C terminus (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We tested the role of the receiver in dephosphorylation by using ′BvgS and ′BvgS with an asparagine substituted for the conserved aspartic acid in the receiver, Asp-1023 (′BvgS D1023N). The proteins were phosphorylated and purified from ATP, and the stability of the phosphoryl group was measured by incubation in buffer containing Mg2+. Phosphorylated ′BvgS decayed rapidly, with a t1/2 of approximately 30 s (Fig. 2A, open circles). In contrast, ′BvgS D1023N was stably phosphorylated under the same conditions, and the t1/2 of the phosphorylated form was nearly 20 min (Fig. 2A, open squares). Dephosphorylation of ′BvgS was accompanied by generation of inorganic phosphate as measured by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 2B). However, ′BvgS D1023N did not dephosphorylate to a substantial degree, and only very low amounts of inorganic phosphate were generated (Fig. 2C). The conserved aspartic acid in the receiver, Asp-1023, is therefore required for efficient dephosphorylation of ′BvgS. When phosphorylated ′BvgS and ′BvgS D1023N were incubated with excess ATP in pulse-chase reactions, the phosphorylated proteins had similar rates of decay (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of excess ATP, ′BvgS and ′BvgS D1023N have vastly different decay rates (Fig. 2). These results suggested that the presence of excess ATP may influence the rate of dephosphorylation of ′BvgS. We purified phosphorylated ′BvgS and ′BvgS D1023N, added excess ATP, and measured phosphorylation as a function of time following ATP addition. The decay rate of the phosphoryl group on ′BvgS was not measurably affected (Fig. 2A, closed circles). However, ′BvgS D1023N dephosphorylated at a significantly increased rate (~7-fold) in the presence of excess ATP, with a t1/2 of approximately 2.5 min (Fig. 2A, closed squares). Nearly identical results were seen upon the addition of ADP or ATPγS to ′BvgS D1023N (data not shown). If binding of ATP or ADP to ′BvgS D1023N stimulates a phosphatase activity of the transmitter, then generation of inorganic phosphate should accompany dephosphorylation. Alternatively, dephosphorylation of ′BvgS could be due to donation of the phosphoryl group to ADP, forming ATP. Reversibility of transmitter phosphorylation has been demonstrated for the NRII (NtrB) sensor protein (16Weiss V. Magasanik B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8919-8923Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, dephosphorylation of ′BvgS D1023N in the presence of unlabeled ATP, ATPγS, or ADP is coincident with formation of labeled ATP. Negligible amounts of inorganic phosphate were detected. Formation of labeled ATP after incubation of phospho-′BvgS D1023N with ATP and ATPγS is most likely due to the presence of ADP, which is either generated by ′BvgS-mediated hydrolysis of ATP or is present as a contaminant in the ATP or ATPγS preparation. We conclude that hydrolysis of the γ-phosphoryl group of ATP by ′BvgS to form phospho-′BvgS and ADP can be reversed but is detectable only in the absence of the receiver function. The BvgS transmitter and C terminus are both potential targets for dephosphorylation by the receiver. To examine the interaction of the receiver with these domains in more detail, we determined the rates of receiver-mediated dephosphorylation of the isolated transmitter and C terminus. The transmitter and C terminus, purified as fusions to glutathione S-transferase, were relatively stable in the absence of the receiver (t1/2 of 10 and 15 min, respectively; Fig. 4). Both proteins were rapidly dephosphorylated in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the BvgS receiver. However, the C terminus was dephosphorylated at faster rate (t1/2 = 6 s) than the transmitter (t1/2 = 30 s). As measured by affinity chromatography and thin layer chromatography, dephosphorylation of the transmitter and C terminus by the receiver is due to transfer of the phosphoryl group to the receiver. The receiver phosphoryl group then undergoes autohydrolysis, generating inorganic phosphate (data not shown). We had previously determined that phosphorylation of the C terminus occurred by a phosphotransfer reaction, but we could not distinguish whether the transmitter or receiver served as a phosphodonor. To determine which domains of BvgS are required or sufficient for particular steps of the phosphorelay, we precisely deleted specific BvgS domains and assayed the resulting mutant proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, ′BvgS was able to autophosphorylate, transphosphorylate the BvgS C terminus (+GST-C), and phosphorylate BvgA (+BvgA). ′BvgS wild type was also slightly dephosphorylated by the addition of the BvgS receiver in trans (+GST-R), and faint labeling of the receiver was detected. ′BvgS with deletion of the receiver and C terminus (ΔRC) retained autophosphorylation ability (Fig. 5) and was dephosphorylated by the BvgS receiver (+GST-R). However, ′BvgSΔRC was deficient for BvgA phosphorylation and transphosphorylation of the C terminus (Fig. 5, +BvgA and +GST-C). From these results, we conclude that the transmitter is not sufficient for phosphorylation of the BvgS C terminus. The inability of the transmitter to phosphorylate BvgA indicates that the only relevant BvgS domain identified thus far for BvgA phosphorylation is the C terminus (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). An exact deletion of the BvgS C-terminal domain (′BvgSΔC) retained autophosphorylation ability (Fig. 5). While ′BvgSΔC was able to transphosphorylate the C terminus (+GST-C), it was unable to detectably phosphorylate BvgA (+BvgA). The in vitro phenotypes of ′BvgSΔRC and ′BvgSΔC indicate that the transmitter is sufficient for autophosphorylation, while the receiver is required for transphosphorylation of the C terminus. It is interesting to note that ′BvgSΔC and ′BvgS were not efficiently dephosphorylated by the addition of the receiver in trans, whereas ′BvgSΔRC was (Fig. 5, +GST-R lanes). The presence of a receiver in cis appears to decrease the efficiency of receiver-mediated dephosphorylation in trans, and we hypothesize that this is due to either stearic effects or a more efficient interaction of the receiver with the transmitter and C terminus in cis. Coincident with their inability to phosphorylate BvgA, BvgSΔRC and BvgSΔC were unable to activate an fhaB::lacZYA fusion in vivo, while wild type BvgS could direct high levels of expression of this fusion (Table I).Table IIn vivo activities of bvgS and mutant derivativesPlasmid namebvgS alleleβ-GalactosidaseunitspDM20Wild type12,000 ± 1,000pMU714ΔRC9.3 ± 0.3pHB50delCΔC10.1 ± 0.3pBR322Vector10.9 ± 0.7 Open table in a new tab The results of Fig. 5 suggested that the BvgS receiver directly mediated the phosphotransfer reaction to the C terminus. This was seemingly contradicted by the fact that we had not been able to detect significant phosphorylation of the BvgS receiver in vitro (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). During experiments in which we were attempting to reconstruct the phosphorylation cascade, we noticed that we could readily purify phosphorylated receiver by affinity chromatography. When the phosphorylated receiver was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immediately following purification (Fig. 6, lane 1), phosphorylation of the receiver could no longer be detected. This same phenomenon was also observed if the phosphorylated receiver was incubated in buffer containing Mg2+ prior to electrophoresis (lane 2). Despite the apparent lability of the phosphorylated receiver to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we reasoned that transfer of the phosphoryl group from the receiver to the C terminus should be readily detectable, since the phosphorylated C terminus is stable to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). When the C terminus was incubated with the purified phosphorylated BvgS receiver, the C terminus was now phosphorylated (lane 3), demonstrating that the receiver can serve as a phosphodonor for the C terminus. In contrast, when the BvgS transmitter was incubated with the phosphorylated receiver, no transfer to the transmitter was detected (′BvgSΔRC, lane 4), suggesting that the phosphotransfer reaction between the transmitter and the receiver is not readily reversible. The instability of the phosphorylated BvgS receiver to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis distinguishes it from the BvgA receiver and many other receivers. Because the BvgS receiver dephosphorylates in the presence of SDS and urea and in the absence of added Mg2+ (data not shown), it is unlikely that extensive secondary structure is required for this phenotype. We suspected that an amino acid adjacent to the proposed site of phosphorylation in the BvgS receiver may be partially responsible for dephosphorylation during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Interestingly, in a comparison of amino acid similarity among 79 receiver domains (17Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), a negatively charged amino acid is never found adjacent to the aspartic acid corresponding to Asp-1023, and BvgS is the only receiver that contains a cysteine adjacent to the conserved aspartic acid. When the receiver is incubated for extended periods in the presence of 0.1% SDS, buffers with pH values of 8.5 or above result in dephosphorylation to background levels, which indicates that electrophoresis per se is not required for dephosphorylation (data not shown). This sensitivity of the phosphorylated BvgS receiver to pH values above 8.5 corresponds with the pK value of the -SH side group of cysteine of 8.3 (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We propose that the presence of a negatively charged amino acid adjacent to the site of phosphorylation in the BvgS receiver is destabilizing and that the pH value of 9.5 of the Tris/glycine front during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Garfin D.E. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 425-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) is the reason for the apparent instability of the receiver in vitro. Despite the extreme base lability of the BvgS receiver, we have been able to clearly define two roles for this domain: dephosphorylation of ′BvgS and phosphotransfer to the C terminus. The BvgAS phosphorylation cascade can be modeled as a stepwise process involving an initial autophosphorylation event followed by three phosphotransfer reactions (Fig. 7). In our model, signal inputs are relayed through the membrane to the transmitter. The transmitter then autophosphorylates at His-729 with the γ-phosphate of ATP to form phospho-BvgS and ADP. This reaction is reversible in vitro, but whether the reversibility is significant in vivo is not known. His-729 donates the phosphoryl group to Asp-1023 of the receiver. Asp-1023 can then donate the phosphoryl group to water to form inorganic phosphate, or it can transfer to His-1172 of the BvgS C terminus. The C terminus can then transfer back to the BvgS receiver, or it can phosphorylate BvgA (11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated BvgA then binds to specific DNA repeats upstream of bvg-activated promoters and effects gene regulation (8Boucher P.E. Menozzi F.D. Locht C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Boucher P.E. Stibitz S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6486-6491Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Steffen P. Goyard S. Ullmann A.

In all cases, mutations that interrupt the phosphorelay in vitro have a corresponding defect in virulence gene activation in vivo (7Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1163-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 11Uhl M.A. Miller J.F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The BvgS receiver is a pivotal component of the phosphorelay. It appears to act as a biochemical checkpoint, mediating phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the C terminus as well as dephosphorylation of the transmitter. We currently do not know what conditions influence these activities of the receiver or whether auxiliary proteins are involved in regulation of receiver activity such as in chemotaxis in E. coli or sporulation in Bacillus subtilis (21Hess J.F. Oosawa K. Kaplan N. Simon M.I. Cell. 1988; 53: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 22Ohlsen K.L. Grimsley J.K. Hoch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A new type of two-component regulatory system that utilizes a His → Asp → His → Asp phosphorelay is emerging, as first described in the regulation of sporulation initiation in B. subtilis and recently described for osmoregulation in yeast (24Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 25Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). This subclass contains a receiver that acts as a phosphorylated intermediate (the BvgS receiver) as well as a histidine phosphotransfer domain (the BvgS C terminus), which acts as an intermediate between two receiver domains. These features distinguish this class from traditional two-component systems. Some of these phosphorelay components can be linked in a single protein, as in BvgS, or unlinked as in the B. subtilis sporulation cascade (24Burbulys D. Trach K.A. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 545-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Another putative member of this subclass includes the ArcB/ArcA proteins, which repress genes involved in aerobic metabolism (26Iuchi S. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5617-5623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Iuchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23972-23980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ishige K. Nagasawa S. Tokishita S.

There are several other defined sensor proteins besides ArcB and BvgS that have a transmitter/receiver/C terminus architecture; these are expected to follow the same multidomain phosphorylation strategy (see Refs. 28Ishige K.

We have been characterizing the biochemistry of BvgAS signal transduction to gain a better understanding of the biological interactions of Bordetella with its animal hosts. bvg is the key regulatory locus controlling a transition between two distinct phases of Bordetella. Several operons are either activated or repressed by BvgAS in B. pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica (2Weiss A.A. Hewlett E.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1986; 40: 661-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 31Akerley B.J. Miller J.F. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 141-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In B. bronchiseptica, bvg-activated genes are necessary for colonization of the respiratory tract, while at least one class of bvg-repressed genes interferes with infection (32Akerley B.J. Cotter P.A. Miller J.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 611-620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 33Cotter P.A. Miller J.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3381-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). bvg-repressed genes in B. bronchiseptica include the motility operon and genes required for production of a siderophore (34Akerley B.J. Monack D.M. Falkow S. Miller J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 980-990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Giardina P.C. Foster L.A. Musser J.M. Akerley B.J. Miller J.F. Dyer D.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6058-6063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Bvg− phase is advantageous for survival under nutrient-limiting conditions (33Cotter P.A. Miller J.F. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3381-3390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The involvement of the BvgAS signal transduction system in several aspects of the Bordetella life cycle suggests that BvgAS function is highly pleotropic and coupled to other regulatory pathways. The multiple domains required for BvgAS signal transduction may allow for coordination of several intracellular and extracellular inputs into a central phosphorelay.

In contrast to our detailed understanding of the role of protein 4.1 in regulating membrane mechanical properties through modulation of spectrin-actin interaction, very little is known regarding the functional implications of protein 4.1 interaction with band 3. In the present study, we explored the potential role of protein 4.1-band 3 interaction in modulating membrane mechanical properties. Based on recent studies which identified the sequence motif IRRRY in band 3 as the protein 4.1 interacting domain, we studied the functional consequences of specific dissociation of band 3-protein 4.1 interaction by the synthetic peptide IRRRY. We show that protein 4.1 bound to the inside-out vesicles could be dissociated from band 3 but not from glycophorin C by IRRRY. Furthermore, incorporation of IRRRY into resealed ghosts resulted in decreased membrane deformability and increased membrane mechanical stability. The observed alterations in membrane properties appears to result from increased band 3-ankyrin interaction following dissociation of protein 4.1 from band 3. These studies have enabled us to identify an important functional role for band 3-protein 4.1 interaction in modulating erythrocyte membrane properties.

https://openalex.org/W2082783596,"We used specific antibodies recognizing the receptor 1 (IFNAR1) and the recently cloned receptor 2.2 (IFNAR2.2) chains of the human type I interferon receptor complex to demonstrate that the interferon β (IFN-β)-specific receptor-associated phosphoprotein is IFNAR2.2 and not an unknown or additional receptor component. Immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that IFNAR2.2 is present in Daudi cells as a cell surface protein of approximately 90-100 kDa, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated and associated with IFNAR1, upon stimulation of cells with IFN-β. IFNAR2.2 was not detected associated with IFNAR1 in cells stimulated with IFN-α, suggesting differences in receptor interaction between the two type I interferons. Both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.2 undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon induction by either IFN-α or IFN-β. Therefore, it is unclear as to why IFNAR2.2 is not detectable in IFNAR1 immunoprecipitates in IFN-β-treated cells. These data suggest that, although IFN-α and IFN-β may utilize similar receptor chains, they interact with IFNAR1 and IFNAR2.2 in different ways."

It was found that all of the E1 variants had significantly reduced specific activities, as reported elsewhere (Russell, G. C., Machado, R. S., and Guest, J. R. (1992) Biochem. J. 287, 611-619). In addition, extensive kinetic studies were performed in an attempt to determine the effects of the amino acid substitutions on the Hill coefficients with respect to thiamin diphosphate and pyruvate. All but one of the variants were incapable of being saturated with thiamin diphosphate, even at concentrations > 5 mM. Most importantly, the striking activation lag phase lasting for many seconds in the parental complexes containing three and one lipoyl domains per E2 chain was totally eliminated in the variants. Furthermore, activation by the coenzyme was localized to the E1 subunit, because resolved E1 exhibits virtually the same behavior during the activation lag phase as does the complex. In the parental complexes two distinct lag phases could be resolved, the duration of both decreases with increasing ThDP concentration. A mechanism that is consistent with all of the kinetic data on the parental complexes involves rapid equilibration of the first ThDP with the E1 dimer, followed by a slow conformational equilibration, that in turn is followed by slow addition of the second ThDP to form the fully activated dimer. When the diphosphate site is badly impaired, the binding affinity is very much reduced, this perhaps eliminates the slow step leading to the activated dimer form of the E1.

This prediction was borne out by the corresponding three-dimensional structures of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) from yeast (see Dyda et al. (24Dyda F. Furey W. Swaminathan S. Sax M. Farrenkopf B.

In particular, substitutions other than Asp to Gly at position 440 (the Mg(II) binding site) led to inactive protein, as did the N467G substitution in the same region. These amino acids are part of the conserved GDG … N.N motif on all ThDP enzymes studied to date. The sequence alignment of nearly 20 ThDP-dependent enzymes also succeeded in identifying the likely region for ThDP binding in E1 of PDHc isolated from E. coli (23Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Russell et al. (1Russell G.C. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) confirmed the importance of such a ThDP fold in PDHc, by showing that the E1 and PDHc activities of site-directed variants in this putative fold were affected. In this report, we extend the studies of Russell et al. to demonstrate that the corresponding substitutions not only diminish the enzyme activity, but also affect the activation of the enzyme by ThDP·Mg(II). E. coli strain JRG1342 carrying plasmids encoding 3-lip PDHc (pGS523) (wild-type), 1-lip PDHc (pGS501), variant PDH complexes with mutations in E1 (G231A (pGS455), N258Q (pGS597), C259S (pGS457), C259N (pGS596)), and strain JRG2600 carrying a plasmid with mutation in E1, G231S (pGS453), were from the laboratories of J. R. G. Cultures were grown in the LB medium containing glucose (0.2%) and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37°C. Expression of the PDH complexes was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactoside to 60 μM. The conditions for overproduction of the 3-lip PDH complex (wild-type) and several 1-lip derivatives were the same as described by Russell et al. (1Russell G.C. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment after preincubation with lysozyme (0.6 mg/ml final concentration) for 15 min. The PDHc was sedimented by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 3 h) and further purified by chromatography on a Sephacryl S-400 HR column. Fractions containing PDHc were pooled and treated with ammonium sulfate to 70% saturation. The enzyme was dissolved in buffer A (20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM benzamidine·HCl) then dialyzed against the same buffer. The PDH complexes were stored in buffer A at −20°C. E1 was resolved from the PDHc on a Sepharose CL-6B (1.5 × 100 cm) column under alkaline conditions. PDHc was dialyzed against 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 9.0, containing 0.1 mM benzamidine·HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride for 2 h, before applying to a column equilibrated and eluted with the same buffer. Analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the first peak to emerge is E2-E3, followed by E1 containing a trace amount of E3. E1 from the parental 3-lip, 1-lip, and G231A variant PDH complexes was also separated from the other subunits using a thiol-Sepharose 4B affinity column (2.5 × 20 cm) under conditions described for resolution of E1 from PDHc isolated from Azotobacter vinelandii (30deGraaf-Hess A.C. de Kok A. FEBS Lett. 1982; 143: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The overall enzymatic reaction of the PDH complexes was assayed using a Varian DMS 300 spectrophotometer or a Cobas Bio (Roche Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ) automated centrifugal analyzer, monitoring the pyruvate-dependent reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm. The reaction medium contained in 1 ml (DMS 300) or 0.25 ml (Cobas-Bio) test volume: 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM magnesium chloride, 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2.5 mM NAD+, 0.052-0.2 mM coenzyme A, 0.2 mM ThDP, and 2.6 mM DTT at 27°C. The reaction was initiated either by adding enzyme to a mixture of all other components, or by adding CoA. Steady-state velocities were taken from the linear portions of the progress curves after completion of the lag phases (if present). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of NADH produced (μmol)/min/mg of protein. The E1 activities in the complexes or of the resolved E1 component were measured according to McNally, Motter, and Jordan (31McNally A.J. Motter K. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19736-19743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained: 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.7, 5.0 mM pyruvate, 12 mM magnesium chloride, 0.2 mM ThDP, and 1.25 mM each of 4,4′-dithiodipyridine and 4-mercaptopyridine. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and monitored at 380 nm at 27°C using the Cobas Bio centrifugal analyzer. Specific activities were calculated using ϵ380 = 72 200 M−1 cm−1 for the reaction product, N- acetyl-4-thiopyridine (32Annan N. Jordan F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 8895-8901Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The activity of resolved E1 was also measured after reconstitution with excess E2-E3 subcomplex using the NADH assay for PDHc activity. The lag phases (τ) were determined graphically as described by Horn and Bisswanger (33Horn F. Bisswanger H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6912-6919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ThDP concentrations were determined using ϵ273 = 7,500 M−1 cm−1 (34Schellenberger A. Hübner G. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1965; 343: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard. The Michaelis-Menten constant Km, the apparent Km, and Hill coefficient (nH) were obtained by fitting the steady-state rates at different concentrations of ThDP or pyruvate with the Hill equation and the logarithmic form of the Hill equation using the Delta Graph (Pro3) and CA-Cricket Graph computer programs. The steady-state rates were also analyzed using the Eadie-Scatchard and Lineweaver-Burk plots. The kinetic parameters represent the mean of at least three independent experimental data sets. Gel filtration high performance liquid chromatography was performed on a TSK G3000-SW column (7.5 mm × 60 cm) equilibrated with 50 mM potassium Pi (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.1% NaN3. The column was calibrated using molecular weight standards (Pharmacia): ovalbumin (43,000), bovine serum albumin (67,000), aldolase (158,000), and ferritin (440,000). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). (CD) studies were performed on a Jobin Yvon Dichrographe Mark VI spectrophotometer at 25°C. A 1.0 cm path length cell was used for the near-UV (250-350 nm) region. The wavelength increment was set at 0.25 nm, and the integration time was 1.0 s, the scan rate was 15 nm/min and the slit width was 2 nm. For each spectrum five-six scans were averaged, and spectra were corrected by subtraction of the spectrum of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Data manipulation, calculations utilized the Jobin-Yvon Dichrographe Software or the KaleidaGraph computer program. In Table I are presented kinetic parameters for the 3-lip and 1-lip PDH complexes, calculated from fitting the steady-state rates for different concentrations of ThDP using the Hill equation. A more detailed analysis using Eadie-Scatchard and Lineweaver-Burk plots revealed deviations from hyperbolic behavior at concentrations of ThDP< 1 μM. ThDP has been reported to exhibit different allosteric regulatory properties at different pyruvate concentrations (36Bisswanger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus at 0.2 mM pyruvate, no cooperativity was observed over the entire ThDP concentration range tested (data not shown), whereas at 0.08 mM pyruvate, the 3-lip PDHc exhibited positive cooperativity (nH = 1.46) for binding ThDP at ThDP concentrations <1 μM, and no cooperativity (nH = 1.0) at ThDP concentrations > 1 μM, in good agreement with Bisswanger (36Bisswanger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, with 2 mM pyruvate, the binding of ThDP by 3-lip PDHc showed no cooperativity at ThDP concentrations < 1 μM, and weak negative cooperatively (nH = 0.79) at ThDP concentrations > 1 μM (Fig. 1). The increasing cooperativity of 3-lip PDHc observed with decreasing concentrations of both ThDP and pyruvate clearly confirm that 3-lip PDHc is regulated by both the cofactor and the substrate. The regulatory properties of 1-lip PDHc were similar to those of the 3-lip PDHc (data not shown).Table I.Steady-state kinetic parameters for ThDP binding to PDH complexesComplexSubstitutionSpecific activityaActivity of 3-lip, 1-lip, and variant PDH complexes was determined using the NADH assay in the presence of 0.2 mM ThDP.

Open table in a new tab Using PDHc from E. coli with low concentrations of ThDP in the incubation medium and saturating concentrations of pyruvate, Bisswanger (36Bisswanger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that the progress curve for the overall reaction (i.e. formation of NADH) exhibits an activation lag phase of several minutes before the steady-state rate is reached. The duration of the lag phase was found to decrease with increasing concentration of ThDP. In our studies the progress curves for the overall reaction using 3-lip and 1-lip PDH complexes exhibited lag phases in the presence of less than 25 μM ThDP when the reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme (see Fig. 2A for typical results). With increasing ThDP concentration, the lag phase shortened (Fig. 2B). At low ThDP concentrations, the lag phase could be several minutes even at saturating pyruvate concentrations. On the other hand, at high ThDP concentrations the lag phase was not apparent on the seconds scale, even at low pyruvate concentrations. Therefore, the ThDP concentration is the major affector for the lag phase. That true steady state was attained subsequent to the lag phase was also demonstrated as follows (data not shown). A reaction, resulting in a progress curve such as shown in Fig. 2A, was initiated by the addition of 1 μM ThDP. Once the presumed steady state was reached, saturating ThDP was added to the reaction (0.2 mM final concentration), and the steady-state rate was measured again. This rate was identical within experimental error to the steady-state rate observed on initial addition of 0.2 mM ThDP. The attainment of steady-state rates subsequent to the lag phase was demonstrated at 0.08 and 2.0 mM pyruvate concentrations. These experiments also excluded the intervention of product inhibition during the measurements. The activation of the E1 component of the 3-lip and 1-lip PDH complexes by ThDP was investigated using the E1-specific assay in order to eliminate the possibility that E2-E3 catalyzed reactions contribute to the lag phase. For ThDP, the experimental results yielded an apparent Km = 0.19 mM and nH = 1.2 for the 1-lip PDHc, and an apparent Km = 0.17 mM and nH = 1.3 for the 3-lip PDHc (Table I). The apparent Km values obtained for ThDP by assaying the E1-specific model reaction are very high for both complexes compared to those obtained by assaying the overall reaction. The kinetic curves for ThDP exhibit weak positive cooperativity although the activation lag phase was still observed with the E1-specific assay. No cooperativity was observed with ThDP and resolved E1 (nH = 1.0, Km = 0.034 mM; see Table I) according to the E1-specific assay. The regulatory properties could not be investigated at low coenzyme concentration due to the low activities observed with the E1-specific assay at ThDP concentrations < 0.005 mM. Nevertheless, the absence of cooperativity at ThDP concentration > 0.005 mM differs from both the weak negative cooperativity (nH = 0.79) observed with the overall PDHc assay at >1 μM ThDP, and from the weak positive cooperativity (nH = 1.2, 1.3) observed with the E1-specific assay for 1-lip PDHc and 3-lip PDHc. However, there was still a detectable lag phase at low ThDP concentrations, and as observed with the 3-lip PDHc (Fig. 2B), the size of the lag phase declines to a diminishing extent with increasing ThDP until saturated (Fig. 2C). These results provide excellent support for the view that the ThDP-dependent lag phase reflects changes taking place solely in the E1 component. It was also shown that the resolved E1 component and the variant E1-G231A are dimers irrespective of ThDP concentration. The apoE1 applied to the TSK G3000-SW column had the same retention time (34.75 min) as the E1-ThDP.Mg(II) complex, as did the corresponding variant E1-G231A (34.86 min). The apparent molecular masses (229 and 224 kDa) deduced for these proteins (Fig. 3) indicated that they are dimeric, in accord with earlier reports (37Vogel O. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 18: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 38Eley M.H. Namshira G. Hamilton L. Munk P. Reed L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 152: 655-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The data suggest that the activation lag phase induced by ThDP binding does not reflect interactions between the E1 and the E2-E3 subcomplex, or dimerization of two E1 subunits. The influence of association-dissociation of the E1 subunit with the E2-E3 subcomplex on the lag phase was not investigated in our laboratory. However, Bisswanger (36Bisswanger H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 48: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported that a lag phase due to the reassociation of E1 with the E2-E3 subcomplex is independent of the concentration of ThDP. It also appears unlikely that 1-lip, 3-lip, or variant PDH complexes contain a weakly bound E1 component after ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 3-4 h. Russell et al. (1Russell G.C. Machado R.S. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that the polypeptide chain stoichiometry of E1p/E2p/E3 in the sedimented 1-lip PDHc was approximately 0.3:1.0:1.3, with a slight decrease in the number of E3 subunits after purification on fast protein liquid chromatography. For 1-lip and 3-lip PDH complexes a plot of 1/τ versus [ThDP] (where τ is the duration of the lag phase) is linear at ThDP concentrations > 1 μM, but deviates from linearity at concentrations < 1 μM (Fig. 3). The data suggest that interaction of ThDP with the apoenzyme in the ThDP concentration range investigated certainly involves more than a single step to reach a catalytically active species. Two lag phases were observed, both ThDP concentration-dependent. At small ThDP concentrations (<1 μM), the duration of the lag phase was longer than that at ThDP concentrations >1 μM. Based on these data, a minimal mechanism can be proposed for ThDP binding at low ThDP concentrations (Fig. 3, inset): rapid equilibrium binding followed by a slow isomerization. In all of these discussions, a dimeric E1 is assumed.
