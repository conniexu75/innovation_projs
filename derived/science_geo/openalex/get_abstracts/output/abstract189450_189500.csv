https://openalex.org/W2127564412,"The rhizobial infection of legumes has the most stringent demand toward Nod factor structure of all host responses, and therefore a specific Nod factor entry receptor has been proposed. The SYM2 gene identified in certain ecotypes of pea ( Pisum sativum ) is a good candidate for such an entry receptor. We exploited the close phylogenetic relationship of pea and the model legume Medicago truncatula to identify genes specifically involved in rhizobial infection. The SYM2 orthologous region of M. truncatula contains 15 putative receptor-like genes, of which 7 are LysM domain–containing receptor-like kinases (LYKs). Using reverse genetics in M. truncatula , we show that two LYK genes are specifically involved in infection thread formation. This, as well as the properties of the LysM domains, strongly suggests that they are Nod factor entry receptors."

Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is targeted for proteasomal degradation by INrf2. Oxidative stress causes release of Nrf2 from INrf2. Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus, binds to the ARE, and activates gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that protein kinase C (PKC) plays a significant role in the regulation of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression and induction in response to t-butylhydroquinone. Treatment of HepG2 cells with the PKC inhibitors staurosporine and calphostin C repressed ARE-mediated induction of a luciferase reporter as well as that of the endogenous NQO1 gene. Similar experiments with inhibitors of MEK/ERK, p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases failed to repress ARE-mediated gene expression. The PKC inhibitor staurosporine blocked the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, suggesting that Nrf2 might be the target for PKC regulation. A Prosite search revealed the presence of seven putative PKC sites in mouse Nrf2. The PKC site at Ser40 is conserved among species and lies in the Neh2 domain, which interacts with INrf2. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of Ser40 is necessary for Nrf2 release from INrf2, but is not required for Nrf2 stabilization/accumulation in the nucleus and transcriptional activation of ARE-mediated NQO1 gene expression. A peptide that competes with endogenous Nrf2 for INrf2 binding was able to induce ARE activity more effectively than t-butylhydroquinone, and Nrf2 that accumulated in the nucleus as a result was not phosphorylated.

Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, the role of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2) is the most clearly established (reviewed in Refs. 1Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell.

Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper protein that does not homodimerize, but that requires heterodimerization with another leucine zipper protein to be active (reviewed in Refs. 1Dhakshinamoorthy S.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, it is believed that INrf2 retains Nrf2 in the cytoplasm (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). When cells are challenged by chemically induced oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from INrf2. Nrf2 then translocates to the nucleus, resulting in the activation of ARE-mediated gene expression. Recently, reports have shown that the interaction of Nrf2 with INrf2 targets Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Tetsuro I. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Nrf2 accumulates in the nucleus of cells from INrf2-deficient mice, in a manner similar to challenge with chemicals that induce oxidative stress (7McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Hayes J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21569-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (874) Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that several kinases, including JNK1, MAPK, p38, and MEK, are involved in regulating ARE-mediated gene expression (8Yu R. Jiao J.J. Duh J.L. Tan T.-H. Tony Kong A.-N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yu R. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Tony Kong A.-N. J. Biol.

Ryu H. Kim S.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1017-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 13Dieter M.Z. Freshwater S.L. Solis W.A. Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, another report has disputed the involvement of p38 and MEK kinases and instead has indicated that protein kinase C (PKC) is the major kinase involved in antioxidant induction of ARE-mediated gene expression (14Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). In vitro studies from the same group showed preferential phosphorylation of a serine residue in the Neh2 domain of Nrf2 by PKC (15Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42769-42774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has long-term interest in Nrf2 regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression with special emphasis on NQO1 gene expression. Because of the conflicting reports on the kinases involved, we felt further studies were necessary. In addition, there is no information available on the kinase(s) involved in the induction of ARE-mediated human NQO1 gene expression in response to antioxidants. Furthermore, it is unknown if phosphorylation of Nrf2 is required only for its release from INrf2 or is required also for stabilization/accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and transcriptional activation of ARE-mediated gene expression. Construction of Plasmids—The construction of pGL2-NQO1-ARE, pcDNA-Nrf2, and pcDNA-INrf2 was as described previously (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA-Nrf2 was used as the template for all mutations of Nrf2. The seven putative PKC sites in Nrf2 were mutated using the QuikChange® II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, two complementary PAGE-purified primers that contained the desired mutation were produced (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). Fifteen cycles of PCR (94 °C for 1 min, 48 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 8 min) were performed using pcDNA-Nrf2 as the template, the primer pair containing the mutation, and PfuUltra HF DNA polymerase. The parental plasmid was then digested with DpnI, and the remaining nicked, circular, mutated plasmid was transformed into maximum efficiency DH5α chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). The forward primers for each mutation are as follows: Nrf2ΔPKC1, 5′-GTG TTT GAC TTT GCT CAG CGA CAG AAG GAC-3′; Nrf2ΔPKC2, 5′-GTG CCC CTG GAG CTG TCA AAC AGA ACG GCC-3′; Nrf2ΔPKC3, 5′-CCA ATG TGA AAA TGC AGC AAA AAA AGA AGT TCC-3′; Nrf2ΔPKC4, 5′-GTG AAA AGA CAA ACA TGC AGC CCG CTT AGA GGC-3′; Nrf2ΔPKC5, 5′-CCT TGT TCC CAA AGC TAA GAA GCC AGA TAC-3′; and Nrf2ΔPKC6, 5′-CAA GAA GCC AGA TGC TAA GAA AAA CTA GG-3′. The reverse primers are the exact complements of the forward primers. The pcDNA-Neh2 and pcDNA-Neh2ΔS plasmids expressing Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains, respectively, were created by PCR, followed by TA cloning into the pcDNA3.1 vector. pcDNA-Nrf2 was used as the template for Neh2, and pcDNA-Nrf2ΔPKC1 was used as the template for the Neh2ΔS domain. The same primer set was used to PCR both constructs: 5′-CCC TCA GCA TGA TGG ACT TGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC CGG CTG AAT TTG GGG AGG-3′ (reverse). Kinase Inhibitor/Luciferase Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were grown in monolayer cultures by procedures described previously (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The cells were cotransfected with a reporter construct containing the human NQO1 gene ARE driving luciferase expression and a Renilla luciferase reporter as an internal control. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were pretreated with inhibitors to various kinases (PD98059 for MEK/ERK, SB23580 for p38, wortmannin for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, genistein for tyrosine kinase, and calphostin C and staurosporine for PKC) for 2 h. All the inhibitors were purchased from Calbiochem and were the highest purity available. The cells were treated with a combination of kinase inhibitor and 50 μm t-butylhydroquinone (t-BHQ) for 16 h. The cells were harvested, washed, homogenized, and analyzed for luciferase activity. The dual luciferase reporter assay from Promega (Madison, WI) and a Packard Topcount NXT luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used to measure luciferase activity according to the manufacturers' protocols. NQO1 Activity—HepG2 cells were pretreated with calphostin C for 2 h, and then fresh medium was added with Me2SO, with 50 μm t-BHQ, or with 50 μm t-BHQ plus increasing concentrations of calphostin C. Two h after treatment, the cells were harvested; cytosolic extracts were prepared; and NQO1 activity was assayed by a previously described method (16Shaw P.M. Reiss A. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. Schembri J. Jaiswal A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cytosolic extracts from HepG2 cells treated with t-BHQ and with t-BHQ plus calphostin C were also resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted, and the NQO1 protein level was visualized using antibodies to NQO1 and actin. Bacterial Expression and Purification of Nrf2—Wild-type Nrf2 and Nrf2ΔPKC1 through Nrf2ΔPKC6 mutants were subcloned into the pProExHTb vector from Invitrogen. These clones were transformed into subcloning efficiency DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen). The bacteria were grown at 37 °C and induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when they reached A 590 = 0.5. The bacteria were grown for another 2 h at 37 °C and then harvested. His6-tagged Nrf2 was purified on a nickel column (QIAGEN Inc.) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's protocol. Before Nrf2 was eluted, the column was washed with diminishing amounts of urea. Nrf2 was then eluted under native conditions with 500 mm imidazole. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Equal amounts of purified Nrf2 or Nrf2ΔPKC mutants were used as the substrate for purified PKC consisting primarily of the α- and β-isozymes (Promega). The purified proteins were incubated with the PKC enzyme and [γ-32P]ATP in PKC buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.7 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml phosphatidylserine) for 1 h at 30 °C. The proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoprecipitation and Phospho-specific Antibodies—Hepa-1 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes. The cells were treated with Me2SO or 50 μm t-BHQ for 2 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. The cell pellet was suspended in 10 volumes of isotonic buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid) and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer 10 times with a loose pestle. The nuclei were pelleted at 3500 rpm at 4 °C. The cytosolic extract was removed, and the pelleted nuclei were lysed using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid). Both extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. Nrf2 was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts using anti-Nrf2 antibody (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Equal amounts of precipitate were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was performed with antibody specific to Nrf2 or phosphoserine (Sigma), phosphothreonine (Cell Signaling, Salem, MA), or phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling). The Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains were pulled down using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose beads (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Similar assays were also performed with Hepa-1 cells transfected with the pcDNA-Neh2-V5 and pcDNA-Neh2ΔS-V5 plasmids in separate experiments. The cytosolic fractions from the transfected cells were prepared by the procedures described above. Cytosolic proteins (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibodies. Equal amounts of immunoprecipitated proteins from the transfected cells were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted, and probed with anti-V5 and anti-phosphoserine antibodies. Nrf2 Localization and Immunofluorescence—Hepa-1 cells were grown on Lab-Tek II chamber slides. The cells were pretreated with 10 nm staurosporine for 1 h and then treated with 50 μm t-BHQ alone or with 50 μm t-BHQ plus 10 nm staurosporine for 2 h. The cells were fixed using formalin and permeabilized with cold acetone. Immunofluorescence was then performed using anti-Nrf2 antibody H-300 and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (Rockland, Philadelphia, PA). The cells were stained with Hoechst stain to visualize the nuclei. A Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescent microscope fitted with a Photometrics CoolSnap CF camera and the appropriate filters was used to capture the fluorescent images. To determine which kinase pathway(s) is involved in ARE-mediated induction, HepG2 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid driven by the NQO1 gene ARE. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were treated with 50 μm t-BHQ for 16 h, resulting in ∼3.5-fold induction over basal activity. This induction was inhibited by cotreatment with the PKC inhibitor staurosporine (Fig. 1). Similar results were also observed with a second PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (Fig. 1). Inhibitors of MEK/ERK (PD98059), p38 (SB23580), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin), and tyrosine kinases (genistein) failed to block t-BHQ induction of the ARE (Fig. 2). The small amount of inhibition observed with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 inhibitors was not significant (p > 0.1). Interestingly, the inhibitors of MEK/ERK and tyrosine kinases stimulated NQO1 ARE-mediated gene expression.Fig. 2Effect of inhibitors of MEK/ERK, p38, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and tyrosine kinases on t-BHQ induction of ARE-mediated gene expression. HepG2 cells were grown in monolayers and cotransfected with ARE-luciferase and Renilla luciferase reporter plasmids. Thirty-six h after transfection, the cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 2 h and then treated with Me2SO, with t-BHQ, or with t-BHQ plus inhibitors for 16 h. The cells were harvested and lysed, and the lysates were analyzed for luciferase activity. The results are presented as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, with each experiment done in triplicate. DMSO, Me2SO; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calphostin C was also able to inhibit the induction of NQO1 activity in vivo (Fig. 3). Untransfected HepG2 cells were treated with calphostin C or with calphostin C plus t-BHQ. The lysates were then assayed for NQO1 activity, and the amount of NQO1 was determined by Western blot analysis. Both NQO1 activity and the amount of NQO1 protein decreased in a dose-dependent manner in response to treatment with the PKC inhibitor. To determine whether PKC inhibitors affect the localization of Nrf2, immunofluorescence was used to follow the distribution of endogenous Nrf2 before and after treatment. Hepa-1 cells were grown on chamber slides; treated with Me2SO, with t-BHQ, with staurosporine, or with t-BHQ and staurosporine; fixed; and probed with anti-Nrf2 antibody (Fig. 4A). In control cells, Nrf2 was found localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, although the fluorescence was weak. After treatment with t-BHQ, Nrf2 accumulated in the nucleus, resulting in a much stronger signal. The PKC inhibitor staurosporine was able to block the t-BHQ-induced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. These results were also confirmed by Western blot analysis. Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were prepared from treated and untreated Hepa-1 cells. The extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Nrf2 antibody (Fig. 4B). Nrf2 was hardly visible in any of the cytosolic extracts or in the nuclear extracts from control cells or from cells treated with staurosporine plus t-BHQ. However, there was an abundance of Nrf2 in the nucleus of t-BHQ-treated cells. These results coincide with the proposed model that Nrf2 is rapidly degraded in the cytosol as a result of the Nrf2/INrf2 interaction and is stabilized/accumulated in nuclei after chemically induced oxidative stress (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Tetsuro I. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21569-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Next, we studied the ability of PKC to phosphorylate Nrf2 in vitro. Histidine-tagged Nrf2 was overexpressed in a bacterial system and purified using nickel-coated Sepharose beads. This Nrf2 was used as the substrate in an in vitro kinase assay utilizing purified PKC as the enzyme (Fig. 5A). Nrf2 was phosphorylated by PKC in vitro. Staurosporine was able to inhibit the phosphorylation, whereas wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, was not. To determine whether Nrf2 is phosphorylated in vivo, we utilized antibodies specific to phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and phosphotyrosine. Hepa-1 cells were treated with Me2SO or t-BHQ. Nrf2 was immunoprecipitated from the cytosolic and nuclear extracts, and Western analysis was performed (Fig. 5B). This revealed that Nrf2 that accumulated in the nucleus in response to t-BHQ treatment was phosphorylated at a serine residue(s). Phosphorylation of Nrf2 in the untreated nuclear extracts could not be detected. It is possible that it is not phosphorylated or that the amount of protein was not sufficient to detect the phosphorylation. Likewise, we could not detect phosphorylation with anti-phosphothreonine or antiphosphotyrosine antibody. The question arises whether PKC inhibitors can block the phosphorylation. However, there was an insufficient amount of Nrf2 in the staurosporine-treated nuclear extracts to determine phosphorylation. A Prosite search revealed seven putative PKC sites in Nrf2. Of these, four are serine residues. 2D. A. Bloom and A. K. Jaiswal, unpublished data. PKC site 1, Ser40, is located in the N-terminal Neh2 domain of Nrf2, the domain that interacts with INrf2 (2Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This PKC site is conserved across the species (human, rat, mouse, and chicken). 2D. A. Bloom and A. K. Jaiswal, unpublished data. Six Nrf2 mutants were made and are referred to as Nrf2ΔPKC1 through Nrf2ΔPKC6 (Fig. 6A). All seven PKC sites were mutated from serine/threonine to alanine. The two threonines located next to each other at positions 417 and 418 were mutated in the same construct, Nrf2ΔPKC3 (Fig. 6A). Mutating the putative PKC sites individually did not have a significant effect on the activity of any of the mutants (Fig. 6B, data shown only for Nrf2ΔPKC1). However, mutating the PKC site in the Neh2 domain resulted in INrf2 inhibiting Nrf2ΔPKC1 more efficiently than wild-type Nrf2 (Fig. 6C). The inhibition of the other mutants by INrf2 was not affected (data not shown). In vitro kinase results revealed that Nrf2ΔPKC1 was not phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. 6D). To further study the effect of this mutation in vivo, constructs were created that would express the Neh2 domain or the Neh2 domain with the PKC1 serine mutation, Neh2ΔS (Fig. 7A). Both domains were tagged with V5 and His6. HepG2 cells were transfected with increasing amounts of these constructs as well as the ARE-luciferase reporter. As expected, the wild-type Neh2 domain was able to compete with endogenous Nrf2 for INrf2. This resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in ARE-luciferase activity (Fig. 7B). At the highest dose, the Neh2 domain induced ARE activity to the same extent as t-BHQ in cells that were not transfected with the Neh2 domain. However, the Neh2ΔS domain was much more efficient in inducing ARE activity. At the highest dose, it induced ARE activity almost twice as much as t-BHQ alone or the wild-type Neh2 domain. To demonstrate binding of the Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains to INrf2 and that the domains can cause the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, Hepa-1 cells were transfected with an empty vector or with vector encoding the Neh2 or Neh2ΔS domain. The cells were treated with Me2SO or t-BHQ, and cytosolic and nuclear extracts were made. Western analysis revealed that the Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains were able to cause the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (Fig. 7C, upper panel). Treatment with t-BHQ or expression of the Neh2 domain caused nearly an equal amount of Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus. However, expression of the Neh2ΔS domain caused a greater amount of Nrf2 to accumulate in the nucleus, consistent with the ARE activity data. The Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains were equally expressed (Fig. 7C, middle panel). The Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains tagged with histidines were precipitated from the cytosolic extract using nickel-coated Sepharose beads. Western analysis using anti-INrf2 antibody revealed that both the Neh2 and Neh2ΔS domains bound to INrf2 in uninduced cells (Fig. 7D). However, after t-BHQ treatment, the wild-type Neh2 domain no longer associated with INrf2. The interaction of the Neh2ΔS domain with INrf2 was not affected by t-BHQ treatment. Next, Nrf2 was immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts from the previous experiment (Fig. 7E). Western analysis demonstrated that only Nrf2 from cells induced with t-BHQ was phosphorylated at serine residues. Nrf2 that accumulated in the nucleus of cells transfected with either the Neh2 or Neh2ΔS domain was not phosphorylated. It may be noteworthy that each lane contains an equal amount of immunoprecipitated Nrf2 in Fig. 7E. It is this reason that the increase in Nrf2 in the presence of t-BHQ in Fig. 7C is not visible in Fig. 7E. Further studies with Hepa-1 cells transfected with Neh2-V5 and Neh2ΔS-V5 and anti-phosphoserine antibody demonstrated that Neh2-V5 and not Neh2ΔS-V5 was phosphorylated (Fig. 7F). Taken together, these results indicate that the phosphorylation of Nrf2 at Ser40 by PKC is required for Nrf2 to evade INrf2-mediated degradation. Phosphorylation is not required for Nrf2 to accumulate in the nucleus. Furthermore, the unphosphorylated form of Nrf2 is able to activate transcription of the ARE. NQO1 is a phase II detoxifying enzyme that competes with the one-electron reducing enzyme cytochrome P450 reductase and catalyzes two-electron reductive metabolism and detoxification of quinones (1Dhakshinamoorthy S.

NQO1-null mice have been generated, and studies have shown that NQO1 plays an important role in regulating the intracellular redox status of cells and protects against myelogenous hyperplasia and quinone-induced redox cycling, oxidative stress, and cytotoxicity (17Radjendirane V.

Studies have also shown that NQO1 protects the skin against benzo-[a]pyrene- and 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene-induced carcinogenesis (20Long II, D.J. Waikel R.L. Wang X. Perlaky L. Roop D.R.

Antioxidants and oxidative stress induce a battery of more than two dozen defensive genes, including NQO1, by an ARE-dependent mechanism (reviewed in Ref. 1Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This coordinated induction of detoxifying genes is of critical importance for antioxidant action and chemoprevention (reviewed in Ref. 1Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Nrf2 is known to bind to the NQO1 ARE as well as to the AREs of several other detoxifying enzyme genes and to activate their transcription in response to antioxidants and xenobiotics (reviewed in Ref. 1Dhakshinamoorthy S. Long II, D.J. Jaiswal A.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is believed to be retained in the cytoplasm by a cytosolic inhibitor, INrf2 (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). When Nrf2 is no longer associated with INrf2, it is stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus. It forms heterodimers with other leucine zipper proteins, leading to the coordinated activation of NQO1 and other detoxifying enzyme genes, including glutathione S-transferase Ya, γ-glutamylcysteinyl synthetase, and heme oxygenase-1 (22Venugopal R.

However, the role of small Maf proteins is controversial. Other studies have shown that Nrf2-small Maf heterodimers repress ARE-mediated gene expression (23Wild A.C. Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33627-33636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 25Nguyen T. Huang H.C. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15466-15473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). t-BHQ treatment does not affect the levels of Nrf2 mRNA (2Jaiswal A.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suspected that t-BHQ treatment leads to the modification of Nrf2 and that these modifications are critical for ARE-mediated induction of detoxifying enzyme genes. It is interesting that inhibitors of MEK/ERK and tyrosine kinases activate ARE-mediated gene expression. It is possible that phosphorylation of Nrf2 by members of these kinase families facilitates the binding of Nrf2 to INrf2 and therefore degradation of Nrf2. Tyrosine kinases are involved in regulating cell growth, so it would not be surprising if this pathway is linked to defensive measures. Inhibition of cell growth could serve as a warning to the cell that the environmental conditions are unfavorable. The cell would then activate defensive genes, through the ARE, to limit cellular damage. A recent report had demonstrated that Nrf2 is phosphorylated in vitro by PKC and that this affects the interaction of Nrf2 with INrf2 in vitro (14Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, the involvement of PKC had been contradicted by other reports (8Yu R. Jiao J.J. Duh J.L. Tan T.-H. Tony Kong A.-N. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yu R. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Tony Kong A.-N. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We confirm that PKC activity is critical for the induction of ARE-mediated gene expression by t-BHQ. Furthermore, we show for the first time in vivo evidence that phosphorylation of Ser40 is necessary for Nrf2 to dissociate from INrf2. Mutation of this residue in the Neh2 domain resulted in the Neh2ΔS domain/INrf2 interaction being unresponsive to t-BHQ treatment. Importantly, inducing Nrf2 nuclear accumulation by overexpressing the Neh2 domain resulted in an increase in ARE activity similar to that caused by t-BHQ induction. The mutant Neh2ΔS domain induced ARE expression and Nrf2 accumulation much more efficiently than the wild-type Neh2 domain or t-BHQ. These data point to the fact that phosphorylation of Nrf2 is not required for it to activate transcription. We demonstrated this by showing that Nrf2 that accumulated in the nucleus in response to t-BHQ treatment was phosphorylated at a serine residue(s), but that Nrf2 that accumulated in the nucleus as a result of Neh2 overexpression was not. Clearly, it is the association of Nrf2 with INrf2 that is regulated by PKC, not Nrf2 stability or activity. The role of PKC phosphorylation of Nrf2 in ARE-mediated gene expression is shown in Fig. 8. Two alternative hypotheses are depicted. Briefly, in Hypothesis I, Nrf2 is retained in the cytoplasm by INrf2. Antioxidants induce the expression of or activate PKC. PKC then phosphorylates Nrf2 that is bound to INrf2. This phosphorylation leads to the release of Nrf2 from INrf2 and the stabilization/nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Phosphorylated Nrf2 binds to the ARE and activates ARE-mediated gene expression. This hypothesis is based on currently accepted results on Nrf2 interaction with INrf2, antioxidant-induced release of Nrf2 from INrf2, and nuclear localization of Nrf2 (3Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 4Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). However, an alternative hypothesis that can not be ruled out is possible. In Hypothesis II, INrf2 is an inhibitor of unphosphorylated Nrf2. INrf2 binds to unphosphorylated Nrf2 and stimulates its degradation (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Tetsuro I. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21569-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Antioxidants/oxidants/other stresses induce/activate PKC, which phosphorylates free Nrf2. Phosphorylated Nrf2 escapes INrf2-mediated degradation and accumulates in the nucleus, where it activates ARE-mediated gene expression. Hypothesis II is based on several observations. First, INrf2 targets Nrf2 for proteasomal degradation (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Tetsuro I. O'Connor T. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 6Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21569-21600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Second, PKC phosphorylates Nrf2 in the Neh2 domain, which binds to INrf2 (this study and Ref. 4Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2787) Google Scholar). The binding of INrf2 to the Neh2 domain might interfere with the availability of Ser40 for phosphorylation by PKC. Third, Nrf2 does not require phosphorylation to accumulate in the nucleus and to activate ARE-mediated gene expression (this study). Future experiments should select one hypothesis and rule out the other. The data suggest that any mechanism that modifies Nrf2, allowing it to disrupt the Nrf2-INrf2 complex and/or to escape Nrf2 binding to INrf2, will result in the up-regulation of ARE-mediated gene expression. Recently, four sulfhydryl groups in INrf2 that are sensitive to the redox state of the cell were reported (29). Alteration of these sulfhydryl groups leads to the loss of the association of Nrf2 with INrf2, leading to the activation of ARE-mediated gene expression (28Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D. Cole R.N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11908-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). It is possible that this mechanism is redundant to the phosphorylation of Nrf2 by PKC or that the two mechanisms work in concert. It is also possible that these two mechanisms are activated in a stimulus- and/or cell type-specific manner. Likewise, there could be other cell type-specific factors that disrupt the Nrf2-INrf2 complex or modify Nrf2, preventing its interaction with INrf2 in response to various stimuli. We are grateful to Drs. Jefferson Y. Chan and Yuet W. Kan (both from University of California, San Francisco) for providing cDNA encoding Nrf2. We thank Dr. S. Dhakshinamoorthy for helpful suggestions."

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of four to six separate cell preparations.Cell Cycle Analysis—DNA content was determined by flow cytometry of cells labeled with propidium iodine and data analyzed by using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). A double thymidine block was performed by a modification of previously described methods (12Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In brief, 24 h after plating cells, 2 mm thymidine was added to the growth medium. After 20 h, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and released from the first thymidine block for 9 h in growth medium. A second block was initiated by adding 2 mm thymidine, and cells were maintained for 20 h. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and released into growth medium for the indicated times. Mitotic index was determined as described previously (13Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O.

For immunoprecipitation of Cdc2, cells plated in 100-mm dishes were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer supplemented with 0.1 TIU/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of protein from post-nuclear supernatants (10,000 × g for 5 min) were precleared for 1 h with protein-G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and then incubated with anti-Cdc2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h followed by protein-G-Sepharose for 1 h. Cdc2 kinase activity was determined by phosphorylation of histone H1 as a substrate in in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Cdc2 as described previously (14Furnari B. Blasina A. Boddy M.N.

For immunoblotting total Cdc2, PY15-Cdc2, cyclins, and β-actin, equal amounts of protein from post-nuclear supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and bound antibody was detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The protein expression was analyzed by using NIH Image and the abundance of histone H1 phosphorylation was determined by phosphoimager analysis.TaqMan™ Analysis—TaqMan™ analysis was performed in asynchronous cells using TaqMan™ chemistry with the ABI 7700 Prism real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The forward and reverse primers for mouse Wee1 kinase were 5′-TTGCTCTTGCTCTCACAGTCGT-3′ and 5′-TGGGAAAGCACTTGTGGGAT-3′, respectively, and the probe was 5′-FAM/CCTTCCCAGAAATGGAGAGCACTGGC/TAM-3′, corresponding to an amplicon of 118 bp. PCR was conducted in triplicate with 50-μl reaction volumes of 1× PCR buffer A (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 μm each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, 100 nm probe, and 0.025 unit/μl Taq Gold (Applied Biosystems). For each experiment, a large master mix of the above components was made and aliquoted into each optical reaction tube. The primer/probe set (5–10 μl) was then added and PCR conducted using the following cycle parameters: 95 °C 12 min × 1 cycle (95 °C 20 s, 60 °C 1 min) × 40 cycles. Data analysis was carried out using sequence detection software that calculates the threshold cycle (Ct) for each reaction, which is used to quantitate the amount of starting template in the reaction. A difference in Ct values (ΔCt) was calculated for each gene by taking triplicate Ct values from three reactions and subtracting the mean Ct of the triplicates for the control gene, GAPDH, for each cDNA sample at the same concentration. An additional difference in Ct values (ΔΔCt) was calculated for each gene by taking the triplicate ΔCt values for each gene in the mutant LAPN1-E266I cells and subtracting the mean ΔCt of the triplicates for the wild-type LAPN cells. As described previously (15Ginzinger D.G. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar), the relative expression levels were calculated as = 2–ΔΔCt.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONRecent evidence indicates that in addition to its function in ion translocation and pH i homeostasis, NHE1 also acts as a scaffold to assemble signaling complexes (1Putney L.K. Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 527-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 15Ginzinger D.G. Exp. Hematol. 2002; 30: 503-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar) and as a plasma membrane anchor for the actin-based cytoskeleton (7Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J.

To selectively impair only the ion translocation function of NHE1, we engineered an ion translocation-defective NHE1 containing an isoleucine substitution for glutamine 266 (NHE1-E266I). In cells expressing NHE1-E266I, the scaffolding and actin anchoring functions of NHE1 are retained, but ion translocation is absent (7Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 16Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Curr. Opin.

For the current study, the effect of ion translocation by NHE1 on cell proliferation was assessed by using NHE1-null LAP1 fibroblasts (9Franchi A. Perucca-Lostanlen D. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9388-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) selected to stably express either wild-type NHE1 with a C-terminal HA tag (LAPN cells) or HA-tagged NHE1-E266I (LAPE cells). Expression of NHE1 in LAPE cells is slightly greater than that in LAPN cells (Fig. 1A), and the increased gel mobility of NHE1-E266I likely reflects a difference in glycosylation (18Counillon L. Pouyssegur J. Reithmeier R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10463-10469Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). NHE1-null LAP1 cells are derived from parental Ltk– cells expressing endogenous NHE (9Franchi A. Perucca-Lostanlen D. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9388-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and Ltk– cells have a pH-dependent H+ efflux that is not observed in LAP1 cells (Fig. 1B). Stable expression of wild-type NHE1 in LAPN cells, but not NHE1-E266I in LAPE cells, restored this efflux (Fig. 1B). Moreover, in LAP1 and LAPE cells maintained in 10% FCS and the presence of 25 mm NaHCO3 and 5% CO2 to ensure the function of HCO3– -dependent transporters, steady-state pH i (Fig. 1C) and the rate of cell proliferation (Fig. 1D) were significantly lower than that in Ltk– and LAPN cells. These findings are consistent with those of previous reports (3Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Denker S.P. Huang D.C. Orlowski J. Furthmayr H. Barber D.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1425-1436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) that NHE1 activity provides a permissive signal for cell proliferation.An initial analysis of DNA content in asynchronous cells indicated that G2/M progression was delayed in LAPE cells compared with LAPN cells (data not shown). This was further investigated by arresting cells in S phase with a double thymidine block and analyzing DNA content by flow cytometry at the indicated times after release from arrest (Fig. 2A). At the time of release (time 0), 83 ± 6% of LAPN cells and 80 ± 8% of LAPE cells were in S phase (mean ± S.E.; n = 3 cell preparations) (Fig. 2B). At 3 h after release, 55 ± 5% of LAPN cells, but only 18 ± 2% of LAPE cells, had entered G2/M (Fig. 2B). At 6 h after release, 58 ± 5% of LAPN cells and 47 ± 4% of LAPE cells were in G2/M, and 22 ± 3% of LAPN cells and 39 ± 4% of LAPE cells remained in S phase. Hence, in the absence of NHE1 activity there is a delay in S phase and impaired entry into G2/M. In three separate cell preparations, there was no indication that LAPE cells had increased necrosis or apoptosis compared with LAPN cells.Fig. 2NHE1 activity promotes G2/M entry. A, DNA content of LAPN and LAPE cells at the indicated times after release from a double thymidine block was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Data represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate cell preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In LAPN cells, the transition from S phase to G2/M was associated with a significant increase in pH i and NHE1 activity. Cytosolic pH, determined in the presence of NaHCO3, increased steadily after release from a double thymidine block, reaching a maximum of 7.48 ± 0.01 at 3 h (Fig. 3A). At 4 h after release, pH i was rapidly and significantly reduced to 7.26 ± 0.02 (p < 0.01) and remained constant for up to 9 h. Additionally, the increase in pH i in LAPN cells at 3 h was associated with a transient increase in NHE1 activity (Fig. 3B), as determined by the rate of pH i recovery (dpH i /dt) from an NH4Cl-induced acid load in a Hepes buffer. In the absence of NHE1 activity in LAPE cells there was also a time-dependent increase in pH i indicating that H+ extrusion mechanisms, independent of NHE1 activity, were activated. The maximum pH i of 7.27 ± 0.01 in LAPE cells, however, was significantly lower than that in LAPN cells (Fig. 3A). These data indicate that the transition from S phase to G2/M is associated with an increase in NHE1 activity, which promotes a marked and transient increase in pH i. In the absence of NHE1 activity, the pH i increase is attenuated, S phase is delayed, and entry into G2/M is impaired.Fig. 3S phase completion is associated with transient increases in pH i and NHE1 activity.

In asynchronous cells, the mitotic index of LAPE cells was 50% lower than that of LAPN cells (4 versus 8%). In eukaryotic cells, mitotic entry is dependent on increased activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 (19Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2216) Google Scholar). At 3 and 6 h after thymidine release, Cdc2 kinase activity in LAPN cells increased, as determined by phosphorylation of histone H1 in in vitro kinase assays using immunoprecipitated Cdc2 (Fig. 4A, top row). Cdc2 kinase activity also increased in LAPE cells, but at delayed 6- and 9-h time points and maximum activity was reduced by 40% compared with LAPN cells (Fig. 4B). The abundance of Cdc2 in LAPN and LAPE cells, however, was similar at all time points (Fig. 4A, middle row). Cdc2 activity is regulated in part by its association with the M phase cyclin B1, which begins to be synthesized at the end of S phase (20Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In both LAPN and LAPE cells the expression of cyclin B1 increased at 3 and 6 h, however, the abundance of cyclin B1 at all time points was markedly less in LAPE cells (Fig. 4C). In contrast, the abundance of cyclin A (Fig. 4C), cyclin E (Fig. 4C), and cyclin D1 (data not shown) was similar in both cell types at all time points. Cdc2 kinase activity is also regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation on tyrosine 15 (21Krek W. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Atherton-Fessler S. Parker L.L. Geahlen R.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), which is promoted by the Wee1/Mik1 family of kinases (23Lundgren K. Walworth N. Booher R. Dembski M. Kirschner M. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 64: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 24Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody indicated that Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 was sustained longer in LAPE cells compared with LAPN cells (Fig. 4A, bottom row), which is consistent with decreased Cdc2 kinase activity. In cDNA array analyses of mRNA isolated from asynchronous cells, LAPE cells had a 2.3-fold increase in Wee1 kinase expression compared with LAPN cells. 2L. K. Putney and D. L. Barber, manuscript in preparation. This finding was confirmed by TaqMan™ analysis, which revealed that Wee1 mRNA was significantly more abundant in asynchronous LAPE cells than in asynchronous LAPN cells (Fig. 4D; p < 0.05; n = 3 separate cell preparations). Collectively, these data suggest that ion translocation by NHE1 alters the activity and expression of M phase regulators and promotes mitotic entry.Fig. 4NHE1 activity regulates the activity and expression of G2/M regulatory proteins. A, Cdc2 kinase activity at the indicated times after release from a double thymidine block was determined by phosphorylation of histone H1 (top row) in in vitro kinase assays with Cdc2 immune complexes.

In support of pH i regulating the timing of G2/M, increasing pH i in the absence of NHE1 activity was sufficient to rescue the time-dependent entry into G2/M and the activity and expression of M phase regulators. To confirm that impaired G2/M entry and transition were not merely due to the constitutive loss of NHE1 activity in LAPE cells, but could also result from acute inhibition of NHE1, the effects of pH i were determined in LAPN cells treated with the amiloride analog ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA), which selectively inhibits NHE1 activity (25Counillon L. Scholz W. Lang H.J. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1041-1045PubMed Google Scholar). At the time of release from a double thymidine block, LAPN cells were treated with either Me2SO (control) or EIPA (25 μm) and were maintained in the continuous presence of 25 mm NaHCO3 and 5% CO2. At 3 h after release, the pH i of LAPN treated with EIPA was significantly lower than control cells (Fig. 5A; p < 0.01; n = 4) and NHE1 activity was completely inhibited (data not shown). To increase pH i in the absence of NHE1 activity, EIPA-treated LAPN cells were incubated in 50 mm NaHCO3 at 15% CO2 at the time of thymidine release, which resulted in an alkalinization to 7.38 ± 0.03, compared with a pH i of 6.98 ± 0.02 with EIPA alone (Fig. 5A). Moreover, increasing pH i in EIPA-treated cells was associated with an increased number of cells in G2/M at 3 h (Fig. 5A). At 3 h after release, the percentage of cells in G2/M was 56 ± 3 for control LAPN cells, 21 ± 3 for LAPN cells treated with EIPA, and 50 ± 4 for LAPN cells treated with EIPA but maintained in 50 mm NaHCO3 at 15% CO2. There was a similarity in the percentage of cells in G2/M at 3 h in LAPE cells expressing a mutant NHE1 lacking ion translocation (Fig. 2B) and in LAPN cells treated with EIPA (Fig. 5B). Like LAPE cells lacking NHE1 ion translocation, acutely inhibiting NHE1 activity in LAPN cells with EIPA was associated with decreased Cdc2 kinase activity compared with control cells, as indicated by histone H1 phosphorylation by immunoprecipitated Cdc2 (Fig. 5, C and D). Compared with control cells, EIPA treatment also increased Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 and decreased cyclin B1 expression (Fig. 5E), indicating that impaired Cdc2 activity and cyclin B1 expression were not merely a consequence of constitutive loss of NHE1 activity in LAPE cells but also resulted from acute inhibition of NHE1 activity. Moreover, increasing pH i in the absence of NHE1 activity was sufficient to increase Cdc2 activity (Fig. 5, C and D), attenuate Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2 (Fig. 5E), and rescue cyclin B1 expression (Fig. 5E).Fig. 5Increasing pH i in the absence of NHE1 activity regulates G2/M timing and regulatory proteins. A, cytosolic pH in LAPN cells at 3 h after release from a double thymidine block. At the time of thymidine release, LAPN cells were treated with Me2SO and maintained in 25 mm NaHCO3 at 5% CO2 (Control), treated with 25 μm EIPA, and maintained in 25 mm NaHCO3 at 5% CO2 (EIPA) or treated with 25 μm EIPA and maintained in 50 mm NaHCO3 at 15% CO2 (EIPA + CO 2).

NHE1 contains an H+ modifier site, which renders activity of the exchanger exquisitely sensitive to changes in pH i. Hence, the transient increase in NHE1 activity could be a response to increased glycolysis and metabolic acid production during DNA replication in S phase, with the concomitant increase in pH i providing a signal for efficient progression from S phase to G2/M. Whether the kinase activities of Cdc2 and Wee1 are pH-sensitive is undetermined. It also remains to be determined whether a specific G2/M regulatory protein is the primary target of increased pH i , although cyclin B1 is a likely candidate. Cyclin B1 synthesis increases at the end of S phase (20Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and cyclin B1 transcription or mRNA stability could be regulated by pH i. Additionally, cyclin B1 levels are transiently reduced by DNA damage (12Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and decreased pH i could be part of a DNA damage-sensing response. An important future direction will be to determine whether increasing cyclin B1 expression is sufficient to rescue the delayed timing of G2/M transition in the absence of transiently increased NHE1 activity and pH i. Most intriguing is the possibility that transient increases in pH i at the completion of S phase constitute a previously unrecognized component of a checkpoint pathway.

Detection of individual nucleotidases by enzymatic assays in cell lysates is problematic because different nucleotidases are co-expressed in the same tissue or cell type. The problem was earlier addressed by immunotitration (for review, see Ref. 14Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. [B]. 1993; 105: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and more recently by a strategy that exploits differences in optimal conditions for the ubiquitous nucleotidases (17Rampazzo C. Mazzon C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Differential assays can take advantage of inhibitors of individual nucleotidases (8Mazzon C. Rampazzo C. Scaini M.C. Gallinaro L. Karlsson A. Meier C. Balzarini J. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Biochem.

The most active inhibitors described so far are pyrimidine nucleotide and nucleoside analogs inhibiting cN-I at nanomolar or low micromolar concentrations with up to 1000-fold selectivity for cN-I relative to cN-II or eN (18Garvey E.P. Lowen G.T. Almond M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two pyrimidine phosphonates inhibit cdN and mdN (8Mazzon C. Rampazzo C. Scaini M.C. Gallinaro L.

Open table in a new tab Ecto-5′-nucleotidase—eN, also known as CD73, is a glycosylated protein bound to the outer surface of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (1Misumi Y. Ogata S. Ohkubo K. Hirose S. Ikehara Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and co-localizes with detergent-resistant and glycolipid-rich membrane subdomains called lipid rafts. Up to 50% of the enzyme may be associated to intracellular membranes (for review, see Ref. 20Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) and be released during homogenization. Early reports of a soluble low Km nucleotidase (for review, see Ref. 20Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) were because of this phenomenon (21Piec G. Le Hir M. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although eN has broad substrate specificity, AMP is considered to be the major physiological substrate (for review, see Ref. 20Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar) (22Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem.

Independently of the enzymatic function, the protein acts as co-receptor in T cell activation (for review, see Ref. 23Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and as cell adhesion molecule (for review, see Ref. 24Spychala J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). eN is variably expressed in a wide number of cell types under physiological and pathological conditions (for review, see Refs. 20Zimmermann H.

In neuronal cells eN expression is linked to developing or plastic states (for review, see Ref. 24Spychala J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 87: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region of the gene contains a number of tissue-specific elements (25Hansen K.R. Resta R. Webb C.F. Thompson L.F.

Cytosolic 5′-Nucleotidase IA—cN-IA was named AMP-specific 5′-nucleotidase for its high specific activity with AMP at millimolar concentrations. Subsequent detailed kinetic studies revealed high affinities toward deoxypyrimidine monophosphates (18Garvey E.P. Lowen G.T. Almond M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is highly expressed in skeletal and heart muscle where it has a physiological function in the generation of signaling adenosine during ischemia (2Sala-Newby G.B. Skladanowski A.C. Newby A.C. J.

The high affinity for deoxynucleoside monophosphates suggests a role in the regulation of deoxyribonucleotide pools. A homologous sequence related to human autoimmune infertility gene (AIRP) and with highest expression in testis has been cloned and designated cN-IB (4Sala-Newby G.B. Newby A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1521: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cytosolic 5′-Nucleotidase II—cN-II is a 6-hydroxypurine-specific nucleotidase, most active with (d)IMP (for review, see Ref. 14Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. [B]. 1993; 105: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and critically positioned to regulate ATP and GTP pools. This tetrameric protein is stimulated by (d)ATP and GTP and regulated by substrate and phosphate in a complex manner (for review, see Ref. 14Itoh R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions cN-II can catalyze phosphotransfer from a purine nucleotide donor to inosine or guanosine (31Worku Y. Newby A.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This reaction is responsible for the activation of several anti-viral and anti-cancer nucleoside analogs that are not substrates for cellular nucleoside kinases (33Johnson M.A. Fridland A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 291-295PubMed Google Scholar, 34Keller P.M. McKee S.A. Fyfe J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8664-8667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic 5′-Nucleotidase III—cN-III is highly expressed in red blood cells where it participates in the degradation of RNA during erythrocyte maturation (for review, see Ref. 15Rees D.C. Duley J.A. Marinaki A.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). It prefers pyrimidine riboover deoxyribonucleotides with CMP being the best substrate. It is inactive with purine nucleotides. The enzyme has a phosphotransferase activity (35Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) less efficient than cN-II (32Pesi R. Turriani M. Allegrini S. Scolozzi C. Camici M. Ipata P.L. Tozzi M.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 312: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The sequence of cN-III coincides with that of p36, an interferon α-induced protein of unknown function (6Amici A. Emanuelli M. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. Saccucci F. Magni G. Blood. 2000; 96: 1596-1598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon 2 gives rise to two proteins that are 286 and 297 amino acids long (36Marinaki A.M. Escuredo E. Dudley J.A. Simmonds H.A. Amici A. Naponelli V. Magni G. Seip M. Ben-Bassat I. Harley E.H. Lay Thein S. Rees D.C. Blood. 2001; 97: 3327-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), with the shorter form corresponding to cN-III. Cytosolic 5′(3′)-Deoxynucleotidase—cdN is a ubiquitous enzyme, first purified to homogeneity from human placenta (37Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is the major deoxynucleotidase activity in cultured human cells (17Rampazzo C. Mazzon C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 38Gallinaro L. Crovatto K. Rampazzo C. Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Milanesi E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35080-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to cN-III, human cdN is not strictly pyrimidine-specific and works efficiently with dIMP and dGMP. dAMP is a poor substrate and dCMP is inactive (8Mazzon C. Rampazzo C. Scaini M.C. Gallinaro L. Karlsson A. Meier C. Balzarini J. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 37Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme is very active on 2′- and 3′-phosphates (7Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neither the highly purified human placental cdN nor the recombinant mouse and human enzymes showed phosphotransferase activity (7Rampazzo C. Johansson M. Gallinaro L. Ferraro P. Hellman U. Karlsson A. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5409-5415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37Höglund L. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6589-6595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to what was reported for cdN purified from human red blood cells (35Amici A. Emanuelli M. Magni G. Raffaelli N. Ruggieri S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial 5′(3′)-Deoxynucleotidase—mdN is highly homologous to cytosolic cdN (52% amino acid identity). The two enzymes are coded by nuclear genes with identical structure, probably derived by a gene duplication event (9Rampazzo C. Gallinaro L. Milanesi E. Frigimelica E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). With its high preference for dUMP and dTMP, mdN shows remarkably narrow substrate specificity. Similarly to cdN, mdN prefers deoxyover ribonucleotides and accepts 2′- and 3′-nucleoside monophosphates (9Rampazzo C. Gallinaro L. Milanesi E. Frigimelica E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8239-8244Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 38Gallinaro L. Crovatto K. Rampazzo C. Pontarin G. Ferraro P. Milanesi E. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35080-35087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Its enzymatic features suggest that mdN regulates mitochondrial dTTP and prevents accumulation of mutagenic dUTP within mitochondria. By opposing the phosphorylation of nucleosides by kinases, intracellular 5′-nucleotidases participate in substrate cycles that regulate the cellular levels of ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates and thereby all ribo- and deoxyribonucleotide pools (for review, see Ref. 39Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) (40Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Intracellular 5′-nucleotidases have relatively high Km values and operate on substrates generally present at (very) low concentrations. Thus they are exquisitely sensitive to oscillations of substrate concentration. Given their overlapping substrate specificities, it is difficult to tie a given enzyme to the maintenance of a specific nucleotide pool. Important information has been obtained with cell lines engineered to overexpress individual nucleotidases. Involvement of a 5′-nucleotidase in a specific substrate cycle is signaled by the increased excretion of the nucleoside produced by that cycle (40Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In such experiments it is important to analyze the turnover of individual pools during brief time windows. Changes in nucleotide pool sizes only show the final end point of complex metabolic adaptations and may be a consequence of reduced ATP availability (29Gazziola C. Moras M. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Verin R. Rampazzo C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Rampazzo C. Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Gallinaro L. Johansson M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By this strategy cN-IA was shown to operate on AMP (27Sala-Newby G.B. Freeman N.V. Skladanowski A.C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and murine cdN was shown to regulate all pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide pools (40Gazziola C. Ferraro P. Moras M. Reichard P. Bianchi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6185-6190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In human cells dCMP should be dephosphorylated by a different enzyme, as human cdN is inactive on dCMP. A potential candidate is cN-IA that has high affinity for all deoxyribonucleotides (3Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 18Garvey E.P. Lowen G.T. Almond M.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9043-9051Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), although it is still not clear whether the expression of this enzyme outside skeletal and heart muscle is sufficient to perform this function (3Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Strategies such as knockout mice and small interfering RNA may help solve these issues. Indeed, down-regulation of mdN in cultured human cells by small interfering RNA showed that mdN participates in a mitochondrial substrate cycle with the mitochondrial thymidine kinase. 3C. Rampazzo and V. Bianchi, unpublished data. The only known genetic syndrome due to 5′-nucleotidase deficiency is the hereditary hemolytic anemia caused by mutation of cN-III (for review, see Ref. 15Rees D.C. Duley J.A. Marinaki A.M. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 120: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Accumulation of normally undetectable pyrimidine nucleotides in erythrocytes of affected subjects highlights the important role of cN-III during maturation of red blood cells. Anti-viral and anti-blastic nucleoside analogs must be activated by phosphorylation to exert their therapeutic effect. Intracellular 5′-nucleotidases influence the metabolism of the analogs by reversing the activation step and thereby decreasing their pharmacological efficacy. Several of the in vitro models of nucleoside analog resistance were linked to high expression of cN-II and cN-IA (3Hunsucker S.A. Spychala J. Mitchell B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10498-10504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Carson D.A. Carrera C.J. Wasson D.B. Iizasa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1091: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (for review, see Ref. 44Galamarini C.M. Mackey J.R. Dumontet C. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 875-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Consistent with the substrate cycle model, the relative ratio of nucleoside kinase to 5′-nucleotidase may have predictive clinical value with 5′-nucleotidases contributing to drug resistance (45Galmarini C.M. Thomas X. Graham K. Jafaari A.E. Cros E. Jordheim L. Mackey J.R. Dumontet C. Br. J. Haematol. 2003; 122: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Development of compounds that inhibit 5′-nucleotidase activity may reverse drug resistance and increase the efficacy of existing analogs. New nucleoside analogs that are poor substrates for 5′-nucleotidases may lead to more effective therapies. Several anti-viral drugs show striking mitochondrial toxicities that pose a serious limitation on their use (46Lewis W. Dalakas M.C. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). One way to address this problem is to develop compounds that are differentially metabolized by cytosolic and mitochondrial 5′-nucleotidases, thus allowing for cytoplasm-specific accumulation of pharmacologically active metabolites. Recent development of cdN and mdN inhibitors that differentially target these enzymes suggests that such strategy is possible (17Rampazzo C. Mazzon C. Reichard P. Bianchi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence in the human genome of at least seven genes for 5′-nucleotidases suggests that these enzymes perform important metabolic functions. With the enzymes available in recombinant form it will soon be possible to complete their biochemical characterization. Gene regulation remains instead an unchartered field. We do not know how strict is the tissue-specific expression of cN-III, how the variable expression levels of the ubiquitous nucleotidases revealed by multiple-tissue Northern blots are obtained, if expression of individual enzymes can be induced or repressed in specific circumstances, and if patterns of expression are altered in specific tumors."

Here, the potential of various spin (doxyl moiety) and fluorescent (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl (NBD) group) labeled cholesterol analogs as well as of fluorescent cholestatrienol and the naturally occurring dehydroergosterol to mimic the unique properties of native cholesterol in lipid membranes was studied in 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membranes by electron paramagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fluorescence spectroscopy. As cholesterol, all analogs undergo fluctuating motions of large amplitude parallel to the bilayer normal. Native cholesterol keeps a strict orientation in the membrane with the long axis parallel to the bilayer normal. Depending on the chemical modification or the position of the label, cholesterol analogs may adopt an “up-side-down” orientation in the membrane or may even fluctuate between “upright” and up-side-down orientation by rotational motions about the short axis not typical for native cholesterol. Those analogs are not able to induce a comparable condensation of phospholipid membranes as known for native cholesterol revealed by 2H nuclear magnetic resonance. However, cholesterol-induced lipid condensation is one of the key properties of native cholesterol, and, therefore, a well suited parameter to assess the potential of steroid analogs to mimic cholesterol. The study points to extreme caution when studying cholesterol behavior by the respective analogs. Among seven analogs investigated, only a spin-labeled cholesterol with the doxyl group at the end of the acyl chain and the fluorophore cholestatrienol mimic cholesterol satisfactorily. Dehydroergosterol has a similar upright orientation as cholesterol and could be used at low concentration (about 1 mol %), at which its lower potential to enhance lipid packing density does not perturb membrane organization.

Cholesterol constitutes a major component of mammalian cellular membranes. Its correct distribution among intracellular membranes and the plasma membrane is essential for the homeostasis of mammalian cells. Thus, intracellular trafficking plays a major role in the correct disposition of internalized cholesterol and in the regulation of cholesterol efflux (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Maxfield F.R. Wüstner D. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lateral and transbilayer organization of cholesterol in the plasma membrane determines membrane structure and dynamics. However, neither its intracellular pathways of trafficking nor its precise lateral organization, e.g. in cholesterol-enriched microdomains such as rafts (2Simons K. Ikonen E.

DHE is a naturally occurring sterol comprising up to 20% of the total sterol in yeast. Its fluorescent-conjugated triene system leaves the 3-β-hydroxyl group and the alkyl tail of the cholesterol backbone unperturbed. Nevertheless, DHE differs from cholesterol in having three additional double bonds and an extra methyl group, whereas CTL has only two additional double bonds compared with native cholesterol. Indeed, modifications of the cholesterol backbone and/or the presence of a reporter group may cause differences in the physico-chemical properties and thus in the behavior of analogs as compared with natural cholesterol (1Maxfield F.R.

In previous studies some of these cholesterol analogs have also been studied by monolayer and permeability experiments. In these studies, the correlation between sterol structure and the influence of sterols on permeability and ordering effects in lipid membranes was investigated (27Demel R.A. Bruckdorfer K.P. van Deenan L.L.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 255: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 28Rogers J. Lee A.G. Wilton D.C. Biochim. Biophys.

To set a basis for selecting appropriate spin-labeled and fluorescent analogs of cholesterol, we have studied the behavior of a variety of those analogs (Fig. 1) in lipid membranes in comparison to native cholesterol. By using NMR, fluorescence, and EPR spectroscopy we investigated in particular the bilayer orientation and dynamics of analogs and their influence on membrane structure and lateral lipid organization. In particular, sterol-induced phospholipid condensation measured by 2H NMR order parameters provides a common basis for the comparison of these analogs. Based on these data we can provide clear recommendations for the capacity of the various analogs to mimic natural cholesterol. The lipids 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-d31-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC-d31), and 25-{N-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-methyl]amino}-27-norcholesterol (25-NBD-cholesterol) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol (22-NBD-cholesterol) and 1-palmitoyl-2-[6-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino]caproyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C6-NBD-PC) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Ergosta-5,7,9(11), 22-tetraen-3β-ol (DHE), 3-doxyl-17β-hydroxy-5α-cholestane (doxyl-androstane), and 3β-doxyl-5α-cholestane (doxyl-cholestane) were purchased from Sigma. 25-doxyl-cholesterol and cholesta-5,7,9,(11)-trien-3β-ol (CTL) were synthesized as described in Refs. 16Morrot G.

Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1984; 36: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, respectively. Purity of CTL and DHE was checked using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. All cholesterol analogs are shown in Fig. 1. The spin-labeled PC analog 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxylpentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SL-PC) was synthesized as described in Ref. 32Fellmann P.

For NMR measurements, mixtures of phospholipids and cholesterol analogs were prepared in chloroform. After evaporating the chloroform under a stream of nitrogen, the samples were redissolved in cyclohexane and lyophilized. Samples were hydrated to 40 wt % D2O for 1H NMR or deuterium depleted H2O for 2H NMR measurements and equilibrated by freeze-thaw cycles and gentle centrifugation. Samples were transferred into 4-mm high resolution MAS rotors for 1H MAS NMR experiments or filled into 5-mm glass vials for static 2H NMR experiments. For fluorescence or EPR experiments, lipid mixtures containing the respective analog after evaporating the chloroform were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 5.8 mm Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4), and large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by the extrusion method (33Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). 1H MAS NMR spectra were acquired on a DRX600 NMR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Rheinstetten) using a 4-mm high resolution MAS probe at a spinning speed of 10 kHz. Typical π/2 pulse lengths were 8.5 μs. T 1 relaxation times were measured using the inversion recovery pulse sequence with 13 delays between 1 ms and 4 s and a relaxation delay of 4 s. In case of spin-labeled analogs, due to the unpaired electron of the doxyl group a fast paramagnetic relaxation mechanism is introduced and the total relaxation rate R 1 = 1/T 1 is the sum of paramagnetic (R 1,p) and dipolar relaxation rate (R 1,d). After measuring R 1,d from a sample of pure POPC, R 1,p can be easily determined for each molecular segment of POPC from the total relaxation rate R 1. Two-dimensional 1H MAS NOESY experiments of the sterol/POPC sample were carried out at various mixing times. Cross-peak volumes were integrated and NOE build-up curves were fitted to the spin pair model yielding cross-relaxation rates (σij) as described in Ref. 34Macura S. Ernst R.R. Mol. Phys. 1980; 41: 95-117Crossref Scopus (1583) Google Scholar. 2H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX300 NMR spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 46.1 MHz for 2H using a solids probe with a 5-mm solenoid coil. The 2H NMR spectra were accumulated using the quadrupolar echo sequence and a relaxation delay of 500 ms. The two 4.8 μs π/2 pulses were separated by a 100 μs delay. 2H NMR spectra were depaked and order parameters for each methylene group in the chain were determined as described in detail in Ref. 35Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar. All NMR spectra were acquired at a temperature of 30 °C. For the reduction measurements of fluorescent and spin-labeled steroid analogs, LUV (lipid concentration 5 mm) containing NBD-labeled (2.5 μm) or spin-labeled (100 μm) analogues were mixed with dithionite (25 or 50 mm) or ascorbic acid (17 mm), respectively. Subsequently, the time-dependent evolution of signal intensities of fluorescence at 4 °C or of EPR at 30 °C (as taken from the height of the midfield peak) were followed. The signal intensities were related to the respective intensities before adding the reducing substance. Measurements were performed at an Aminco-Bowman Series 2 fluorescence spectrometer (Urbana, IL) and at a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer, respectively. POPC, POPC/DHE, and POPC/CTL samples were checked for lipid oxidation over a time course of 24 h after preparation using MALDITOF mass spectrometry (36Schiller J. Arnhold J. Benard S. Müller M. Reichl S. Arnold K. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 267: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). No significant oxidation products were detected. Transverse Distribution of Cholesterol Analogs in Membranes—To evaluate the potential of various analogs to mimic natural cholesterol first their orientation and transverse distribution along the membrane normal was determined and compared with native cholesterol. It is known that cholesterol molecules assume an upright position in the membrane with the polar OH group facing the aqueous phase (37Forslind E. Kjellander R. J. Theor. Biol. 1975; 51: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Due to the high mobility in the liquid crystalline phase, a distribution of the steroid parallel to the membrane normal has been observed and attributed to out of plane motions for the sterol (38Endress E. Heller H. Casalta H. Brown M.F. Bayerl T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13078-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In the current study, the width of this distribution was determined by 1H MAS NOESY. Intermolecular cross-relaxation rates between cholesterol and phospholipid segments provide a measure for the strength of the interaction between molecular segments (39Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1999; 103: 243-251Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown recently, the effects of spin diffusion do not contribute to the cross-relaxation process in liquid-crystalline membranes (40Huster D. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1992-1993Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A characteristic NMR signal of the cholesterol moiety is the methyl group at carbon position C-18 (see Fig. 1). Quantitative analysis of the cholesterol-lipid cross-peaks, therefore, provides a measure of the interaction strength of the C-18 methyl protons with lipid segments and thus of the transverse distribution profile of the sterol in the membrane leaflet. In Fig. 2A, the cross-relaxation rates of these protons with various phospholipid segments are plotted. There is an interaction of the C-18 methyl group only with the phospholipid chains, indicating a transverse distribution of the molecule. The width of the distribution indicates relatively large fluctuations of cholesterol parallel to the bilayer normal. Such a broad distribution is in good agreement with the amplitude of out of plane motions of cholesterol of ∼10 Å measured by neutron diffraction (38Endress E. Heller H. Casalta H. Brown M.F. Bayerl T.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13078-13086Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For comparison, the distribution of DHE and CTL in POPC bilayers are also shown in Fig. 2, B and C. As for cholesterol, similar patterns of cross-relaxation rates only with the phospholipid chains are observed, suggesting that both DHE and CTL are embedded similarly in the POPC bilayer. Next, we investigated the orientation and distribution of three doxyl-labeled cholesterol analogs in the membrane. Unpaired electrons as present in the nitroxide spin labels introduce a fast paramagnetic relaxation mechanism that dominates all other interactions. As with cross-relaxation rates, the paramagnetic relaxation rates can be interpreted as contact probabilities between the doxyl group and various lipid segments (41Vogel A. Scheidt H.A. Huster D. Biophys. J. 2003; 85: 1691-1701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, D-F, paramagnetic relaxation rates for SL-androstane (D), SL-cholestane (E), and SL-cholesterol (F) are plotted. For all three SL analogs a broad distribution of the doxyl groups around their average position is found reflecting their high mobility in the membrane. Even contacts of the doxyl group with the phospholipid headgroups and the chain termini are observed, indicating also a high degree of molecular disorder in the phospholipid membrane. The distribution of the doxyl group of SL-androstane (Fig. 2D) has a broad maximum in the lower region of the phospholipid chain, whereas the probability of the probe to be in the glycerol/headgroup region is smaller. This suggests that the molecule faces the membrane interior with the doxyl group and the aqueous phase with the OH group, which places the ring system of SL-androstane exactly opposite to natural cholesterol. From the width of the distribution a highly dynamic reorientation can be concluded, which may include even rotations of the molecule within one membrane leaflet (perpendicular to the membrane normal) as suggested in Ref. 16Morrot G. Bureau J.F. Roux M. Maurin L. Favre E. Devaux P.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 897: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar. The doxyl group of SL-cholestane (Fig. 2E) is also broadly distributed with its maximum in the lipid/water interface (upper chain/glycerol/headgroup region) of the membrane. Thus, the orientation of SL-cholestane in the membrane resembles that of native cholesterol, but the width of the distribution suggests a more dynamic reorientation of the analog. For SL-cholesterol (Fig. 2F) a much sharper distribution of the doxyl group is observed with a maximum at the chain termini of the phospholipids. This is very similar to the orientation of the native cholesterol molecule. The probability for an unusual up-side-down orientation is very small. To corroborate these results, we carried out EPR reduction experiments measuring the accessibility of the water soluble ascorbate toward spin-labeled cholesterol analogs. For reference, the ascorbate-mediated reduction of the spin label moiety of the phospholipid analog SL-PC was assessed. The label moiety of this analog linked to the short fatty acid chain is localized at the polar head group region allowing a rapid reduction by ascorbate (42Seigneuret M. Zachowski A. Herrmann A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4271-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found a rapid reduction of SL-PC localized in the external membrane leaflet (Fig. 3A). Because ascorbate does not partition into the hydrophobic phase, and the transbilayer movement of SL-PC is very slow (43Buton N. Hervé P. Kubelt J. Tannert A. Burger K.N.J. Fellmann P. Müller P. Herrmann A. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13106-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), analogs in the inner leaflet are shielded from reduction, therefore, only 50% of the label is reduced. Consistently, the rapid reduction of their EPR signal intensity of SL-androstane and SL-cholestane after addition of ascorbate underlines the preferential orientation of the label moiety in the lipid/water interface observed by NMR. The complete loss of signal intensity observed can be explained either by a preferential localization of the analogs in the outer membrane leaflet or by their rapid transbilayer movement. However, there is no reason to assume that the analogs are enriched in the outer leaflet. Numerous studies have given indications for a rapid translocation of cholesterol across membranes on the time scale of seconds or minutes even at 4 °C (15Müller P. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1418-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 44Lange Y. Dolde J. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

In contrast to cholestane and androstane, we observed only a slight reduction of signal intensity of SL-cholesterol, which provides independent evidence for a localization of its doxyl group in the membrane interior and its cholesterol like orientation. Using a similar approach, i.e. by measuring the kinetics of dithionite-mediated quenching of NBD fluorescence at 30 °C, we determined the orientation of the NBD moiety of 22-NBD-cholesterol and 25-NBD-cholesterol in POPC-LUV (Fig. 3B). For reference, we also measured the reduction of C6-NBD-PC fluorescence by dithionite. As it was previously shown the short fatty acid residue of the analog bearing the NBD group loops back to the membrane surface (47Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 48Huster D. Müller P. Arnold K. Herrmann A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 822-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thereby the NBD group is exposed to the lipid/water interface and thus easily accessible to dithionite as demonstrated by the rapid reduction of C6-NBD-PC in the external membrane leaflet (Fig. 3B, line b). Because of the slow transbilayer movement of C6-NBD-PC and the negligible permeation of dithionite across the membrane, analogs in the inner leaflet are efficiently shielded from reduction. For 22-NBD-cholesterol we observed a rapid and complete decline of fluorescence intensity upon addition of dithionite (Fig. 3B, line d) even at 4 °C (Fig. 3B, line c). This indicates that (i) the NBD moiety is preferentially localized in the polar interface and (ii) the analog has a high transbilayer mobility. A similar rapid reduction by dithionite was observed for 25-NBD-cholesterol (data not shown). These results show that the orientation and the motion parallel to the membrane normal vary significantly between cholesterol analogs. Out of the seven analogs investigated, four molecules (SL-cholestane, SL-cholesterol, CTL, and DHE) are embedded into membranes with a similar orientation as natural cholesterol. SL-androstane and the NBD-labeled cholesterol analogs exhibit an up-side-down orientation in the membrane and, therefore, are not well suited as analogs for cholesterol. Lipid Condensation in POPC/Cholesterol Analog Membranes—To further explore the potential of fluorescent or spin-labeled cholesterol analogs to mimic native cholesterol we studied packing properties of phospholipid/cholesterol analog mixtures. It is well known that cholesterol condenses lipid bilayers by reducing the area per phospholipid molecule in the membrane and increasing chain order parameters (35Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17299-17308Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 49Oldfield E. Meadows M. Rice D. Jacobs R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2727-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 50Ipsen J.H. Mouritsen O.G. Bloom M. Biophys. J. 1990; 57: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This effect has been attributed to favorable van der Waals interactions between the steroid ring system and saturated phospholipid acyl chains (51Davies M.A. Schuster H.F. Brauner J.W. Mendelsohn R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4368-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because lipid condensation is a very unique property of cholesterol and strongly attenuated for other sterols (52Krajewski-Bertrand M.-A. Milon A. Hartmann M.-A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1992; 63: 235-241Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is a valuable parameter to assess whether or not an analog has the same properties as native cholesterol. Individual order parameters along the lipid chains can be calculated from the quadrupolar splittings of 2H NMR spectra of chain perdeuterated lipid molecules. In Fig. 4, order parameters for the palmitoyl chain in POPC in the absence and in the presence of 10 and 20 mol % cholesterol are plotted (black symbols). It is evident that the lipid chain order increases with increasing cholesterol concentration. In general, POPC chain order parameters in the presence of 20 mol % of the respective spin-labeled (Fig. 4A) and fluorescent cholesterol analogs (Fig. 4B) indicate a lower lipid condensation than for native cholesterol. Only for SL-cholesterol and CTL, lipid condensation is rather similar to that of cholesterol. At 20 mol %, DHE induces a lipid chain ordering comparable with less than 10 mol % cholesterol, whereas other analogs show an effect on the order of or less than that of 5 mol % cholesterol. The same conclusion on the lipid condensing effect can be derived from plotting the data as the average order parameter of POPC bilayers (Fig. 5). The parameter correlates linearly with the concentration of cholesterol in the studied range from 0 to 20 mol %. For all analogs, the a"
https://openalex.org/W2138831030,"Recent studies indicate novel roles for the ubiquitous ion pump, Na,K-ATPase, in addition to its function as a key regulator of intracellular sodium and potassium concentration. We have previously demonstrated that ouabain, the endogenous ligand of Na,K-ATPase, can trigger intracellular Ca2+ oscillations, a versatile intracellular signal controlling a diverse range of cellular processes. Here we report that Na,K-ATPase and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) form a cell signaling microdomain that, in the presence of ouabain, generates slow Ca2+ oscillations in renal cells. Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, we detected a close spatial proximity between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R. Ouabain significantly enhanced FRET between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R. The FRET effect and ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations were not observed following disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Partial truncation of the NH2 terminus of Na,K-ATPase catalytic α1-subunit abolished Ca2+ oscillations and downstream activation of NF-κB. Ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations occurred in cells expressing an InsP3 sponge and were hence independent of InsP3 generation. Thus, we present a novel principle for a cell signaling microdomain where an ion pump serves as a receptor.

Here we report that Na,K-ATPase and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) form a cell signaling microdomain that, in the presence of ouabain, generates slow Ca2+ oscillations in renal cells. Using fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements, we detected a close spatial proximity between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R. Ouabain significantly enhanced FRET between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R. The FRET effect and ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations were not observed following disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Partial truncation of the NH2 terminus of Na,K-ATPase catalytic α1-subunit abolished Ca2+ oscillations and downstream activation of NF-κB. Ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations occurred in cells expressing an InsP3 sponge and were hence independent of InsP3 generation. Thus, we present a novel principle for a cell signaling microdomain where an ion pump serves as a receptor. Na,K-ATPase is an integral membrane protein expressed in all eukaryotic cells, where it functions as a key regulator of intracellular Na+ and K+ concentrations (1.Skou J.C. Esmann M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 249-261PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, point to an additional role for Na,K-ATPase as a signal transducer (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc.

Importantly, Na,K-ATPase has an endogenous ligand, ouabain, a steroid hormone that dose-dependently inhibits the activity of Na,K-ATPase. The biological role of ouabain is, despite extensive research, not well understood. Ouabain belongs to the family of cardiac glycosides, which have been used for centuries in the treatment of heart disease. Recently, several investigators have noted that cardiac glycosides may act as anticancer agents (6.Haux J. Med. Hypotheses. 1999; 53: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7.Repke K.R. Schon R. Megges R. Weiland J. Nissen E. Matthes E. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1995; 10: 177-187PubMed Google Scholar). We have described a new cell signaling pathway triggered by ouabain (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).

Our results from that study indicated that Ca2+ oscillations occurred as an interplay between different Ca2+ transporters and that Ca2+ release via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) was involved in this event. Na,K-ATPase does not possess the characteristics of a G-protein-coupled receptor. Given the generality of Na,K-ATPase expression and its significant role in cell homeostasis, it is important to identify the molecular mechanisms by which Na,K-ATPase can act as a signal transducer. Here we show that the generation of Ca2+ oscillations by ouabain is dependent on the physical association of Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R in a signaling microdomain. renal proximal tubule inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor fluorescent resonance energy transfer phospholipase C endoplasmic reticulum sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase cyclopiazonic acid 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate cytochalasin D aquaporin-4 glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP. renal proximal tubule inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor fluorescent resonance energy transfer phospholipase C endoplasmic reticulum sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase cyclopiazonic acid 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate cytochalasin D aquaporin-4 glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP. Expression Plasmids—A cDNA fragment encoding wild type rat Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit (NKAα1) was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was digested by ApaI/XbaI restriction enzymes and cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) to obtain pGFP-NKAα1. A mutant NKAα1 with truncation of the first 32 amino acids (NKAα1.M32) was generated using PCR. The region of truncation of the NH2 terminus was decided on the basis of structure/function analysis reported elsewhere (8.Daly S.E. Lane L.K. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23683-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The sense primer sequence was 5′-AAAGGGCCCATGGAAGTGTCTATGGACGAC-3′, corresponding to nucleotide positions 349–366 of NKAα1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_012504) with an additional ApaI site and ATG codon on the 5′-end of the primer. The antisense primer was 5′-CTTGCCGTGGAGGAGGATAGAACT-3′, corresponding to nucleotide positions 1792–1815 of NKAα1. The PCR product and pGFP-NKAα1 were hydrolyzed by ApaI/AflII restriction enzymes and ligated for cloning pGFP-NKAα1.M32. A fusion protein with NH2-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) and 95 amino acids of NKAα1 (GST-NKAα1.N95) was constructed using Gateway Technology (Invitrogen). Briefly, a cDNA fragment encoding 95 amino acids of the Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit NH2 terminus was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems). The PCR product was cloned in pENTR/D-TOPO vector using pENTR Directional TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pDEST-15 using Gateway System (Invitrogen) to obtain pGST-NKAα1.N95. The nucleotide sequences of all constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing (KISEQ, Core Facilities of Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden) and subsequent bioinformatics analysis using Lasergene software (DNASTAR). For FRET control experiments, the cytosolic NH2 terminus of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) was tagged with GFP to obtain pGFP-AQP4 (9.Zelenina M. Zelenin S. Bondar A.A. Brismar H. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F309-F318Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). InsP3R type 1 ligand binding protein (226–604 amino acids) with point mutation (R441Q) encoding InsP3 sponge was cloned into a pEF-BOS-MCS vector (pEF-GSTm49-IRES-GFP) (10.Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). pEGFP-actin was from Clontech. Cell Culture and Transfections—Three types of renal cells were used: primary cultures of rat RPT cells prepared as described (11.Uhlen P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Soderblom T. Backhed F. Celsi G. Brismar H. Normark S. Aperia A. Richter-Dahlfors A. Nature. 2000; 405: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), COS-7 cells, a cell line derived from fetal monkey kidney, and LLC-PK1 cells, a cell line derived from pig kidney. GFP-NKAα1 was stably expressed in COS-7 cells (12.Belusa R. Wang Z.M. Matsubara T. Sahlgren B. Dulubova I. Nairn A.C. Ruoslahti E. Greengard P. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20179-20184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). pGFP-NKAα1, pGFP-NKAα1.M32, pEF-GSTm49-IRES-GFP, or pEGFP-actin was transiently transfected into RPT cells on culture day 2 using CLONfectin (Clontech). pGFP-AQP4 was transiently transfected into COS-7 cells on culture day 2 using CLONfectin (Clontech). Reagents—Reagents were used at the following concentrations: 20 μm cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), 5 μm cytochalasin D (CytD), 100 pm-250 μm ouabain, 5 μm 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), 0.5 μm bradykinin, and 5 μm U73122. All reagents were from Sigma. Intracellular Calcium and Sodium Measurements—Intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ measurements were performed using Fura-2/AM and SBFI/AM (Molecular Probes), respectively, as described previously (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11.Uhlen P. Laestadius A. Jahnukainen T. Soderblom T. Backhed F.

After baseline recording, cells were treated, and ratio images were recorded every 30 s for 45–90 min. In each dish, 20–30 individual cells from a single cluster of cells were analyzed. Results presented are representative single cell traces obtained from a minimum of 12 experiments. Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—For co-immunolocalization and FRET studies, COS-7 cells stably expressing GFP-NKAα1 were fixed with acetone for 3 min at room temperature and then incubated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum and 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h. InsP3Rs were probed with monoclonal mouse anti-rat InsP3R type 2 (KM1083) or type 3 (KM1082) antibodies (1 μg/ml) (13.Sugiyama T. Furuya A. Monkawa T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Satoh S. Ohmori K. Miyawaki A. Hanai N. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C. Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody served as secondary antibody (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were scanned with a Leica TCS SP inverted confocal scanning laser microscope. NF-κB activation was measured in RPT cells by immunocytochemical staining as described previously (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). RPT cells transiently transfected with pGFP-NKAα1.M32 were treated with 250 μm ouabain for 30 min and then fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde (10 min). Following blocking as described above, cells were incubated with NF-κB p65 antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h and then with Alexa 546 fluorescent secondary antibody (1:500, Molecular Probes) for 30 min. Slides were scanned using a Leica TCS SP inverted confocal scanning laser microscope, and images of cells expressing the construct were identified by GFP signal; NF-κB immunostaining of cells was captured for the same field of view. NF-κB activation in individual cells was semiquantitatively estimated by measuring the ratio between the mean NF-κB immunosignal in a given comparable area in the nucleus and cytoplasm in cells expressing GFP-NKAα1.M32 or those adjacent cells not expressing the construct using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). FRET—Fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were performed on a Leica TCS SP inverted confocal scanning laser microscope using a ×40/1.4 NA objective. A detailed description of the FRET technique can be found elsewhere (14.Kenworthy A.K. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar, 15.Wouters F.S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The Förster constant, R0, for the donor-acceptor pair, GFP and Cy3, used in this study was 6 nm (16.Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). FRET occurs when the fluorophores are separated by distances 0.5 R0 < r < 2 R0. Thus, it is possible to distinguish proteins that are spatially co-localized within a 12-nm radius. To determine FRET, we quantified the quenching of donor fluorescence by performing acceptor photobleaching (14.Kenworthy A.K. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 289-296Google Scholar). COS-7 cells stably expressing GFP-NKAα1 and stained with Cy3-labeled secondary goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) to detect mouse monoclonal antibody to InsP3R2 (KM1083) and InsP3R3 (KM1082) were excited with 488 and 543 nm and collected separately. The acceptor, Cy3, was then irreversibly photobleached in a selected adequate region by continuous excitation with 543 and 633 nm lasers for 30–90 s. Thereafter, the residual Cy3 and GFP image was obtained, and identical regions, at the plasma membrane on individual cells, were outlined in the photobleached area and processed using ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). Ratios between GFP intensities of the plasma membrane region, after and before photobleaching, were calculated to quantify FRET. The FRET values presented are corrected for erroneous intensity changes in a selected region outside the bleached area. In a typical experiment, 10–15 cells were measured for each sample. Immunoprecipitation Studies—Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCL (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) and left for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were sonicated (3 × 2 s at setting 2 using a Branson Sonifier 250, Branson Ultrasonics) and centrifuged at 9,000 × g at 4 °C to obtain a crude cell extract. 500 μg of supernatant protein/reaction were precleared with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h to reduce background that may be caused by non-specific adsorption of cellular debris. After a low speed centrifugation, the resultant supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with a mouse monoclonal anti-Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit antibody (1:250; Upstate Biotechnology), a mouse monoclonal anti-InsP3R2 antibody (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or a mouse monoclonal antibody anti-InsP3R3 antibody (1:50; BD Biosciences). Immunocomplexes were incubated with protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, washed, and incubated with 2× Laemmli buffer, and supernatants were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis using 6% acrylamide gels. Membranes were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal anti-InsP3R3 antibody (1 μg/ml; KM1082) and then for 1 h using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) prior to detection using ECL plus (Amersham Biosciences). The resultant protein bands were scanned digitally and densitometrically analyzed by Bio-Rad QuantitativeOne software. GST Pull-down Assay—GST-NKAα1.N95 was produced in the BL21 strain of Escherichia coli and purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). Non-recombinant GST was used as a control. Detergent-extracted RPT cell lysate (prepared as described above for the co-immunoprecipitation protocol) was added to the beads in a 5:1 ratio (v/v) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. Beads were washed and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer prior to SDS gel electrophoresis (6% gel) and immunoblotting for InsP3R3. Data Presentation and Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of a minimum of 10 experiments, unless indicated otherwise. Student's t test was used, and significance was accepted at p < 0.05. In accordance with previous observations (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), ouabain (250 μm) induced highly regular intracellular Ca2+ oscillations with a periodicity in the minute range in RPT cells (Fig. 1a). Typical Ca2+ oscillations were detected about 5–15 min after ouabain exposure in approximately one-third of the cells and were generally initiated in one cell at the periphery of a cell cluster. Quantitatively and qualitatively, COS-7 cells treated with ouabain showed a similar Ca2+ oscillatory response (Fig. 1b). Spontaneous oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ were never observed in untreated cells. Na,K-ATPase activity is dose-dependently inhibited by ouabain, and 250 μm ouabain causes ∼50% inhibition of rat Na,K-ATPase activity (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Ouabain, 250 μm, exceeds circulating levels in rat, estimated to be in the pm-nm range (17.Hamlyn J.M. Blaustein M.P. Bova S. DuCharme D.W. Harris D.W. Mandel F. Mathews W.R. Ludens J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6259-6263Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). When cells were exposed to physiological ouabain doses (100 pm), Ca2+ oscillations were observed (Fig. 1c) in ∼1% of cells. For subsequent experiments designed to explore the mechanism by which Na,K-ATPase triggers Ca2+ oscillations, we used 250 μm ouabain. To elucidate the source of the Ca2+ oscillatory response, intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores were depleted by preincubation with a sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor, CPA (Fig. 1d). Ouabain did not induce Ca2+ oscillations in CPA-pretreated cells. Regulated Ca2+ release from intracellular ER Ca2+ stores occurs mainly via InsP3Rs or via ryanodine receptors. InsP3Rs are abundantly expressed in RPT cells, whereas ryanodine receptors do not have any functional importance for ouabain-triggered Ca2+ oscillations in these cells (2.Aizman O. Uhlen P. Lal M. Brismar H. Aperia A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13420-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The membrane-permeable substance, 2-APB, was initially introduced as a specific inhibitor of InsP3Rs (18.Bootman M.D. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Roderick H.L. Berridge M.J. Peppiatt C.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1145-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The IC50 for inhibition of InsP3R-evoked Ca2+ release was reported to be 1–20 μm. Since then, 2-APB has, in addition to its inhibitory effect on InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, been shown to block store-operated calcium-mediated cytosolic Ca2+ influx (19.Peppiatt C.M. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Seo J.T. Roderick H.L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Store-operated calcium is generally fully inhibited by 50–100 μm 2-APB. Exposure of cells to concentrations of 2-APB higher than 100 μm may also cause a pronounced increase of basal cytosolic Ca2+, consistent with inhibition of the SERCA pump (19.Peppiatt C.M. Collins T.J. Mackenzie L. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Seo J.T. Roderick H.L. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Since available data suggest that low concentrations (up to 20 μm) of 2-APB will preferentially inhibit InsP3Rs, we tested the effect of 5 μm 2-APB. Using this concentration, we found that ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations were abolished in the majority of cells treated with 2-APB (5 μm) (Fig. 1e). Collectively, the inhibitory effects of CPA and 2-APB demonstrate that release of Ca2+ via InsP3Ris an essential contributor to the Ca2+ oscillations triggered by the ouabain/Na,K-ATPase complex. Activation of InsP3Rs is critically dependent on activation of phospholipase C (PLC), phosphatidylinositol lipid hydrolysis, and liberation of InsP3. Notably, however, recent studies indicate that InsP3R function is also modulated by interaction with accessory proteins (20.Tang T.S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 21.Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.O. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 173-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To examine the role of InsP3 for the ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations, RPT cells were transfected with a construct encoding a hyper-affinity InsP3 absorbent, an InsP3 sponge. The InsP3 sponge, having more than 1000-fold higher affinity for InsP3 than InsP3R, traps InsP3 and abrogates InsP3-induced Ca2+ release (10.Uchiyama T. Yoshikawa F. Hishida A. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8106-8113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The construct also encoded GFP to facilitate identification of transfected cells. Ouabain triggered low frequency Ca2+ oscillations in one-third of the cells expressing the InsP3 sponge (Fig. 1f). The amplitude of the oscillatory response was attenuated in some, but not all, of the cells expressing the InsP3 sponge. To confirm the efficiency of the InsP3 sponge in quenching InsP3-mediated Ca2+ signaling in RPT cells, we treated cells with bradykinin, a well known activator of PLC and InsP3 production (23.Felder C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Bradykinin induced single Ca2+ transients in virtually all non-transfected cells but was without effect in all cells expressing the InsP3 sponge (Fig. 1g). Cells expressing only GFP exhibited regular ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations (data not shown). It was further found that preincubation of RPT cells with a PLC inhibitor, U73122, abolished bradykinin-induced Ca2+ transients (data not shown) but did not influence ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations (Fig. 1h). These findings indicate that ouabain-induced Ca2+ oscillations do not require increased InsP3 levels to activate InsP3R in this model. Immunocytochemical studies, performed on COS-7 cells, revealed partial co-localization of Na,K-ATPase with InsP3R types 1, 2, and 3 (InsP3R1, InsP3R2, and InsP3R3), respectively. Only InsP3R2 (Fig. 2a) and InsP3R3 (Fig. 2b) were studied in subsequent experiments since these isoforms were more abundantly expressed than InsP3R1. To investigate the spatial relationship between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R on a nanometer scale, FRET measurements were performed. In this protocol, we used COS-7 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged Na,K-ATPase α1-subunit. These cells express approximately the same level of Na,K-ATPase as wild type COS-7 cells (12.Belusa R. Wang Z.M. Matsubara T. Sahlgren B. Dulubova I. Nairn A.C. Ruoslahti E. Greengard P. Aperia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20179-20184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GFP, which was fused to the cytosolic NH2 terminus of Na,K-ATPase, served as FRET donor (GFP-NKAα1). The primary antibodies against InsP3R2 or InsP3R3 were probed with a Cy3-conjugated IgG secondary antibody, which served as the FRET acceptor (InsP3R-Cy3). The epitopes recognized by the InsP3R2 and InsP3R3 antibodies are located in the cytoplasmic COOH terminus of the respective InsP3Rs (13.Sugiyama T. Furuya A. Monkawa T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Satoh S. Ohmori K. Miyawaki A. Hanai N. Mikoshiba K. Hasegawa M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The GFP-NKAα1 fluorescence intensity was, following acceptor photobleaching, enhanced 12.5 ± 0.9% for InsP3R2 and 15.5 ± 2.0% for InsP3R3 (Fig. 3, a and b). These results imply that the donor and acceptor complexes, GFP-NKAα1 and anti-InsP3R-anti-mouse IgG-Cy3, were separated less than 12 nm, i.e. the maximal distance for FRET detection between GFP and Cy3 (16.Ng T. Squire A. Hansra G. Bornancin F. Prevostel C. Hanby A. Harris W. Barnes D. Schmidt S. Mellor H. Bastiaens P.I. Parker P.J. Science. 1999; 283: 2085-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Ouabain treatment significantly increased FRET (from 15.5 ± 2.0% to 25.0 ± 1.6%) between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R (Fig. 3, a and b).Fig. 3Studies of Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R signaling microdomain.a and b, FRET measurements between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R3. a, GFP-NKAα1 images of COS-7 cells with and without ouabain treatment before and after acceptor photobleaching (bleached area indicated by square). b, quantitative changes in emission intensities after bleaching as compared with before bleaching, mean ± S.E., *, p < 0.05.

For these negative control experiments, GFP-AQP4 was expressed in COS-7 cells. FRET analysis was performed using GFP-AQP4 (donor) and the same Cy3-labeled secondary antibody to detect the InsP3R3 antibody (InsP3R3-Cy3, acceptor). No change in donor emission ratio before and after acceptor photobleaching was found for this molecular pair (data not shown). This result indicates that FRET between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R3 is not likely a result of non-specific effects of the fixation protocol on plasma membrane and ER membrane integrity and strengthens the conclusion that the physical association between Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R3 is specific. Co-immunoprecipitation studies added further support to the concept that Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R are linked together in a microdomain. As shown in Fig. 3c, InsP3R3 co-immunoprecipitated with Na,K-ATPase in COS-7 cells. The amount of InsP3R3 that co-immunoprecipitated with Na,K-ATPase represented only a fraction (<50%) of the total InsP3R3 present in the initial cell lysate. Non-immune IgG did not co-immunoprecipitate a detectable amount of InsP3R3 (data not shown). Incubation of COS-7 cells with ouabain significantly increased the amount of InsP3R3 associated with immunoprecipitated Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 3, c and d). The propensity of InsP3R3 to co-immunoprecipitate with Na,K-ATPase was also demonstrated in RPT and LLC-PK1 cells (Fig. 3e). InsP3R isoforms form heterotetrametric channels (24.Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Sugiyama T. Yoneshima H. Yamamoto-Hino M. Furuichi T. Saruta T. Hasegawa M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14700-14704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and as expected, InsP3R2 co-immunoprecipitated with InsP3R3 in all cell types (Fig. 3e). Both Na,K-ATPase and InsP3R bind to cytoskeleton proteins that are anchored by the actin network (25.Bourguignon L.Y. Jin H. Iida N. Brandt N.R. Zhang S.H. J. Biol.

To examine whether the signaling function of the Na,K-ATPase/InsP3R complex depends on an intact cytoskeleton, RPT cells were pretreated with CytD to depolymerize the"

Thus, it is essential to maintain neural precursor cells until late stages of neural development for generation of a wide variety of cell types. Here, we found that the Hes-related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes Hesr1/Hey1 and Hesr2/Hey2 are expressed in the ventricular zone, which contains neural precursor cells. Misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 by electroporation in mouse brain at embryonic day 13.5 transiently maintains neural precursor cells and thereby increases late-born neurons, which are located in the superficial layers. In contrast, misexpression of the genes at later stages inhibits neurogenesis and promotes generation of astroglial cells. In transient transfection assay with cultured cells, both Hesr1 and Hesr2 inhibit transcription induced by the neuronal bHLH genes Mash1 and Math3. These results indicate that Hesr1 and Hesr2 negatively regulate neuronal bHLH genes, promote maintenance of neural precursor cells, and increase late-born cell types in the developing brain.

These results indicate that Hesr1 and Hesr2 negatively regulate neuronal bHLH genes, promote maintenance of neural precursor cells, and increase late-born cell types in the developing brain. Neural development involves the following three sequential processes: expansion of neural precursor cells, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis (1Schuurmans C. Guillemot F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Panchision D.M. McKay R.D.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 478-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In mice, neural precursor cells proliferate without giving rise to neurons until mid-gestation. Then, neurogenesis starts and continues until around birth. Differentiating neurons migrate out of the ventricular zone into the outer regions, forming the cortical plate. During this process, newly born neurons migrate through the layers of older neurons to form more superficial layers, thereby making the inside-out pattern. Gliogenesis starts before birth, but the majority of glial cells such as astrocytes are generated after neurogenesis. It has been shown that these developmental processes are regulated by multiple basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; E (e.g. E13.5), embryonic day; P (e.g. P1), postnatal day; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; MAP2, microtubule-associated protein-2. genes (3Kageyama R.

In contrast, neuronal bHLH genes such as Mash1, Math3, and Neurogenin encode transcriptional activators and promote neurogenesis (17Guillemot F. Lo L.-C. Johnson J.E. Auerbach A. Anderson D.J.

Cell. 2002; 109: 61-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Inactivation of neuronal bHLH genes impairs neurogenesis, and the cells that are inhibited from neuronal differentiation remain as neural precursor cells initially but, at later stages, prematurely differentiate into astrocytes (20Tomita K. Moriyoshi K. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5460-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 21Nieto M. Schuurmans C. Britz O. Guillemot F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these phenotypes of neuronal bHLH gene deficiency are similar to those of misexpression of Hes1 and Hes5, which also initially maintain neural precursor cells but later promote gliogenesis (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Because Hes1 and Hes5 can functionally antagonize neuronal bHLH genes (7Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 8Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that misexpression of Hes1 or Hes5 leads to the situations similar to neuronal bHLH gene deficiency. Thus, antagonistic regulation between multiple bHLH genes is important for timing the processes of precursor expansion, neurogenesis, and gliogenesis. Despite these extensive studies, mutational analyses of the bHLH genes explain only a portion of the neural development, suggesting that other uncharacterized bHLH genes also should be involved in such processes. For example, although the lack of Hes1 and Hes5 impairs maintenance of neural precursor cells, these cells still proliferate at a slower rate without losing the multipotentiality to differentiate into neurons and glial cells (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 28Ohtsuka T. Ishibashi M. Gradwohl G. Nakanishi S. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that other genes should be involved in maintenance of this cell type. Recent studies demonstrated that Hes-related bHLH genes, termed Hesr genes (also referred to as Hey/HRT/CHF/HERP/gridlock), are expressed in the developing brain and retina (29Kokubo H. Lun Y. Johnson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 30Leimeister C. Externbrink A. Klamt B. Gessler M. Mech.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6071-6079Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the retina, Hesr2 promotes Müller glial development (35Satow T. Bae S.-K. Inoue T. Inoue C. Miyoshi G. Tomita K. Bessho Y. Hashimoto N. Kageyama R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), like Hes1 and Hes5, suggesting that Hesr and Hes genes share some functions in neural development. In agreement with this notion, recent studies revealed that Hesr and Hes proteins exert synergistic effects by forming heterodimers (36Iso T. Sartorelli V. Poizat C. Iezzi S. Wu H.-Y. Chung G. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6080-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we found that Hesr1 and Hesr2 are expressed in the developing brain and that misexpression of the Hesr genes transiently increases neural precursor cells and thereby promotes generation of late-born cell types. Both Hesr1 and Hesr2 efficiently inhibit the neuronal bHLH genes Mash1 and Math3, like Hes1 and Hes5. These results indicate that Hesr genes are negative regulators of neuronal bHLH genes and promote maintenance of neural precursor cells. Northern Blot Analysis—HincII fragment of Hesr1 cDNA and BsrGI/SacII fragment of Hesr2 cDNA isolated from mouse retina were used as probes (35Satow T. Bae S.-K. Inoue T. Inoue C. Miyoshi G. Tomita K. Bessho Y. Hashimoto N. Kageyama R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA (2 μg) from mouse brains was electrophoresed on a formaldehyde/1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Membranes were hybridized at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA and washed at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. In Situ Hybridization—Digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes corresponding to EcoRI-SalI and EcoRI-HindIII fragments of Hesr1 and Hesr2 cDNAs, respectively (35Satow T. Bae S.-K. Inoue T. Inoue C. Miyoshi G. Tomita K. Bessho Y. Hashimoto N. Kageyama R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were synthesized in vitro. In situ hybridization was carried out, as described previously (8Akazawa C. Sasai Y. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21879-21885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 16-μm-thick cryosections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, acetylated for 10 min, and then washed three times with PBS for 5 min each. Sections were hybridized at 65 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution containing 200 ng/ml digoxigenin-labeled probes. After hybridization, sections were washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, treated for 1 h in 0.5% blocking solution (Roche Applied Science), and incubated at 4 °C overnight in blocking solution containing anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments (diluted 1:1000, Roche Applied Science). For color reaction, sections were incubated in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.5), 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm levamisole containing 0.84 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.66 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Labeled preparations were imaged using a Carl Zeiss Axiophoto microscope equipped with an AxioCam color CCD camera. In Utero Electroporation—Mouse Hesr1 and Hesr2 cDNAs were inserted into the EcoRI site of pCLIG, which directs expression of test genes as well as of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) through the internal ribosomal entry site from the upstream long terminal repeat promoter with cytomegalovirus enhancer (15Hojo M. Ohtsuka T. Hashimoto N. Gradwohl G. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2515-2522PubMed Google Scholar). For the introduction of DNA, pregnant mice were deeply anesthetized, and a ventral midline incision was made to perform in utero manipulation as described previously (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The expression vector (5 μg) in solution containing 0.05% trypan blue as a tracer was injected through the uterine wall with a glass micropipette into the telencephalic vesicles of each embryo. 1 μg of pCL-EGFP was also co-injected with the expression vectors in many cases because EGFP+ cells can be more easily identified. After injection, electroporation (five 50-ms square pulses of 50 V with 950-ms intervals) was carried out as described previously (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Then the abdominal wall of the pregnant mouse was sutured, and embryos were allowed to develop in utero. The brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C, treated in 25% sucrose in PBS overnight, and embedded in OCT compound. 16-μm-thick cryosections were cut and examined immunohistochemically. In the electroporated region, nearly 100% of the cells initially seem to be transfected. Immunochemistry—Fixed cryosections were washed three times with PBS, preincubated in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then incubated with antibodies. The primary antibodies used are as follows: rabbit anti-GFP (diluted 1:1000, Molecular Probes), mouse anti-MAP2 (1:500, Sigma), mouse anti-NeuN (1:500, Chemicon), mouse anti-GFAP (1:400, Sigma), and mouse anti-nestin (1:500, Pharmingen). To detect these antibodies, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200, Vector), biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Vector), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:200, Vector), fluorescein isothiocyanate-avidin D (1:1000, Vector), Fluorolink Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1:400, Amersham Biosciences), and Fluorolink Cy3-labeled streptavidin (1:1000, Amersham Biosciences) were used. TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed as follows. Fixed cryosections were incubated in TdT buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mm sodium cacodylate, 1 mm cobalt chloride) with biotin-16-dUTP (12.5 μg/ml, Enzo) and TdT (100 units/ml, TaKaRa) at 37 °C for 1 h and detected with Fluorolink Cy3-labeled streptavidin. Fluorescently labeled preparations were imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. For quantitative analyses, labeled cells were counted in the area of 460 × 500 μm2 (Fig. 2) and 460 × 1000 μm2 (Fig. 5). Three independent experiments were performed. On average, 197.2 GFP+ cells were counted for Fig. 2 and 209.4 GFP+ cells for Fig. 5.Fig. 5Misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E15.5 increases astrocytes at P5.

Tomita K. Inoue T. Kageyama R. Development. 2001; 128: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The brain was incubated with 0.05% trypsin and 20 μg/ml DNase I in Hanks' balanced salt solution lacking Ca2+/Mg2+ for 15 min at 37 °C, and 2.5 volumes of the culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum was added. The cells were pelleted, resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing DNase I, triturated, and plated on polyethyleneimine-coated (Sigma) and fibronectin-coated (Invitrogen) 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc). After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and subjected to immunochemical analysis. Luciferase Assay—The reporter plasmid contained the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the β-actin promoter with seven repeats of the E-boxes (AGGCAGGTGGC) (24Bae S.-K. Bessho Y. Hojo M. Kageyama R. Development. 2000; 127: 2933-2943PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length cDNA fragments of Hesr1 and Hesr2 were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector, pCI Vector (Promega). Expression plasmids for Mash1, Math3, and E47 were described previously (7Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter (0.1 μg) and the eukaryotic expression plasmids (0.3–0.4 μg) were transfected with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) into C3H10T1/2 cells, which were plated in 6-multiwell plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. 2 ng of the plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the SV40 promoter, pRL-SV40 vector (Promega), was also transfected as an internal standard to normalize the transfection efficiency. After 24 h, the cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured using a Lumat LB9507 (Berthold). Expression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 in the Brain—Hesr gene expression in the brain was first determined by Northern blot analysis. During the period from embryonic day 15 (E15) to adult, both Hesr1 and Hesr2 are expressed (Fig. 1A), whereas Hesr3 expression is almost undetectable (data not shown). Hesr1 and Hesr2 expression was further examined by in situ hybridization. At E12, both Hesr1 and Hesr2 are expressed in the ventricular zone of the developing brain (Fig. 1, B and C). Hesr1 expression is observed throughout the brain (Fig. 1B), whereas Hesr2 expression is restricted to the mediodorsal region of the brain (Fig. 1C, arrowheads). At E15, Hesr1 and Hesr2 are expressed at a high level in the ventricular zone and at a low level in the cortical plate (Fig. 1, D–G). At this stage, Hesr2 expression is also observed in the ventral region, in addition to the mediodorsal region, of the brain (Fig. 1F). Hesr1 and Hesr2 expression is also observed in the ventricular zone of the ventral spinal cord (Fig. 1, H and I). In contrast, the sense probes did not detect any specific signals (Fig. 1, J and K). These results indicate that Hesr1 and Hesr2 are expressed mainly by undifferentiated cells in the developing brain. Misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E13.5 Maintains Neural Precursor Cells at E16.5—To analyze the functions of Hesr1 and Hesr2 in neural development, we misexpressed the genes in the developing mouse brain by using the expression vector pCLIG, which also directs EGFP expression as a marker. The expression vector DNA was injected into the telencephalic vesicles of E13.5 mouse embryos in utero, and electroporation was performed. By this method, the vector DNA was transiently introduced into the ventricular cells on the plus side. Embryos were then allowed to develop in utero. Three days later (E16.5), brains were isolated from the treated embryos, and the fates of the transfected cells (EGFP+) were examined histologically. When electroporation of pCLIG was performed at E13.5, the majority of the EGFP+ cells migrated out of the ventricular zone and were located in the intermediate zone and the cortical plate at E16.5 (Fig. 2, A and D). In addition, those in the cortical plate expressed the neuronal marker MAP2 (Fig. 2, A, B, and C, inset), indicating that many of the pCLIG-transfected cells differentiated into neurons during the period of E13.5–E16.5. In contrast, when electroporation of pCLIG-Hesr1 or pCLIG-Hesr2 was performed at E13.5, the majority of EGFP+ cells remained in the ventricular zone at E16.5 (Fig. 2, H, K, O, and R). Furthermore, these cells were negative for MAP2 expression (Fig. 2 H–J and O–Q) but expressed nestin, a marker of neural precursor cells (Fig. 2, K–M and R–T, insets in M and T). Quantification of each cell type in sections demonstrated that whereas nearly 50% of the pCLIG-transfected cells became MAP2+ neurons, only 10% of the pCLIG-Hesr1- or pCLIG-Hesr2-transfected cells did (Fig. 2V). These results indicate that Hesr1 and Hesr2 inhibit neurogenesis and maintain neural precursor cells during E13.5–E16.5. We also performed TUNEL assay to examine whether cell death is induced by Hesr genes. However, we did not see any significant difference in the TUNEL+ cell numbers (Fig. 2, G, N, and U). Thus, block of neurogenesis by Hesr genes is not due to neuronal death. Misexpression of Hesr2 at E13.5 Expands the Ventricular Zone—Because Hesr genes maintain neural precursor cells in the embryonal brain, we next examined whether the ventricular zone is affected by misexpression. pCLIG-Hesr2 was introduced by electroporation into the lateral wall of the telencephalon at E13.5, and the ventricular zone was examined at E15.5 by the specific markers, Hes5 and Notch2. At E15.5, the endogenous Hesr2 expression was present in the mediodorsal region of the telencephalon (Fig. 3A, arrowheads), whereas the electroporation-mediated ectopic Hesr2 expression was observed at the lateral region (Fig. 3A, arrow, and B). In this region, both Hes5 and Notch2 expression was expanded outwardly (Fig. 3, C–F, arrows), compared with the control brain (Fig. 3, G and H). These results indicate that misexpression of Hesr2 expands the ventricular zone by maintaining excessive neural precursor cells. Misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E13.5 Generates Late-born Neurons at P1—We next examined the later effects of misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2. The expression vectors were electroporated at E13.5, and the fates of the EGFP+ cells were examined at postnatal day 1 (P1). When Myc-tagged Hesr genes were misexpressed under this condition, Myc expression was already lost at P1 (data not shown), whereas EGFP expression was detectable, probably because EGFP is more stable than Hesr proteins (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Thus, this experiment allowed us to follow the fates of the transfected cells after Hesr expression was down-regulated. When pCLIG was electroporated, the majority of the transfected cells were found in the cortical plate and expressed the late neuronal marker NeuN in addition to MAP2 at P1 (Fig. 4, A–D). When pCLIG-Hesr1 or pCLIG-Hesr2 was introduced by electroporation, many of the transfected cells were found in both the cortical plate and the ventricular/subventricular zone at P1 (Fig. 4, E, H, I, and L). The cells found in the cortical plate expressed MAP2, whereas those in the ventricular/subventricular zone did not (Fig. 4, H and L). These results indicate that some of the transfected cells, which remained as precursors at E16.5 by misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2, differentiated into neurons at P1. However, these transfected cells were located in more superficial layers than those transfected with pCLIG (Fig. 4, A, E, and I), suggesting that misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 delays the birth dates of neurons. Agreeing with this notion, many of the transfected cells still did not express NeuN (Fig. 4, G and K), in contrast to the pCLIG-transfected cells, which mostly expressed NeuN (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E13.5 increases late-born neurons at P1. Misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E15.5 Increases Astrocytes at P5—The observed effects of Hesr1 and Hesr2, maintenance of neural precursor cells and increase of late-born neurons, are very similar to those of Hes1 and Hes5 (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Previous studies demonstrated that when misexpressed at later stages, Hes1 and Hes5 promote gliogenesis in the brain (13Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We therefore misexpressed Hesr1 and Hesr2 at E15.5 and examined the cell fates at P5. When pCLIG was introduced by electroporation, many of the EGFP+ cells migrated into the cortical plate and differentiated into NeuN+ neurons (Fig. 5A, inset). In contrast, when pCLIG-Hesr1 or pCLIG-Hesr2 was introduced by electroporation, many of the EGFP+ cells remained in the ventricular/subventricular zone and differentiated into GFAP+ astrocytes (Fig. 5, E and H, insets). Quantification of each cell type in sections demonstrates that whereas 80% of the pCLIG-transfected cells became neurons, the majority of pCLIGHesr1- or pCLIG-Hesr2-transfected cells became astrocytes (Fig. 5J). Again, there is no significant difference in the TUNEL+ cell numbers between these samples, indicating that cell death does not account for the effects by Hesr1 and Hesr2 (Fig. 5, C, F, and I). These results indicate that misexpression of Hesr1 or Hesr2 at E15.5 inhibits neurogenesis and promotes gliogenesis. To quantify the effects of Hesr1 and Hesr2 misexpression with an alternative method, we next performed electroporation at E15.5 and dissociated the brains at P5. Those dissociated cells were attached to the plates and stained with anti-MAP2 and anti-GFAP antibodies. Under this condition, EGFP+-MAP2+ neurons (Fig. 6, A–L, arrowheads) and EGFP+-GFAP+ astrocytes (Fig. 6, M–X, arrowheads) can be clearly quantified. When pCLIG was electroporated at E15.5, more than 60% of the EGFP+ cells differentiated into MAP2+ neurons, whereas only 30% became GFAP+ astrocytes at P5 (Fig. 7). In contrast, when pCLIG-Hesr1 or pCLIG-Hesr2 was electroporated at E15.5, about 60% of the EGFP+ cells differentiated into GFAP+ astrocytes (Fig. 7). Although the exact ratios of neurons and astrocytes determined by this dissociation method are somewhat different from those determined by counting in sections (Fig. 5J), both methods clearly showed the decrease of neurons and increase of astrocytes by Hesr genes. We also performed TUNEL assay to examine whether cell death is induced by misexpression of Hesr1 and Hesr2. However, we did not detect any clear induction or block of cell death (dat"

When examined at the single-molecule level, the speeds of digestion were nearly constant at 4 nanometers per second (12 nucleotides per second), interspersed with pauses of variable duration. Long pauses, occurring at stereotypical locations, were strand-specific and sequence-dependent. Pause duration and probability varied widely. The strongest pause, GGCGAT TCT, was identified by gel electrophoresis. Correlating single-molecule dwell positions with sequence independently identified the motif GGCGA. This sequence is found in the left lambda cohesive end, where exonuclease inhibition may contribute to the reduced recombination efficiency at that end."
https://openalex.org/W1970402342,"The scavenger receptor CD36 binds a diverse array of ligands, including thrombospondin-1, oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL), fatty acids, anionic phospholipids, and apoptotic cells. CD36 has been reported to be present in lipid rafts/caveolae, but little is known about the membrane trafficking of this protein at baseline or following ligand binding. Here, we determined that expression of CD36 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and endogenous expression of CD36 in C32 cells led to a homogeneous distribution of the protein on the plasma membrane, as judged by confocal fluorescence microscopy. This homogeneous pattern was observed both by anti-CD36 antibody staining and by live cell imaging of CHO cells expressing a chimeric CD36-green fluorescent protein construct. In contrast, caveolin-1 displayed its usual punctate surface distribution. Correspondingly, dual labeling of CD36 and caveolin-1 showed essentially no overlap, neither by immunofluorescence light microscopy nor by immunogold electron microscopy. Furthermore, isolation of lipid rafts by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of cold Triton X-100 cell lysates yielded both CD36 and caveolin-1, but immunoprecipitates of caveolin-1 did not contain CD36. Binding of Ox-LDL led to internalization of CD36 and OxLDL into endosomal structures that did not contain caveolin-1 or transferrin but that co-internalized the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored protein decay accelerating factor, a lipid raft protein. Furthermore, expression of CD36 in the caveolin-1-negative KB cell line is sufficient for OxLDL-induced internalization of CD36, indicating that caveolin-1 is not required for this endocytic process. Taken together, these data demonstrate that at steady state, CD36 is localized in lipid rafts but not in caveolae, and that binding of OxLDL to CD36 leads to endocytosis through a lipid raft pathway that is distinct from the clathrin-mediated or caveolin internalization pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2135955015,"We previously demonstrated that a 31-bp nucleotide sequence located upstream of the rice Wx gene played an important role in its expression. We further showed that this cis-acting regulator interacts with nuclear proteins extracted from developing rice endosperm. We used the 31-bp sequence as bait in a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate several cDNA clones from a rice cDNA expression library. One of these cDNAs encodes a MYC protein, designated OsBP-5, which is 335 amino acids long and contains a putative basic helix-loop-helix-ZIP DNA-binding domain. This domain exhibits 50% amino acid sequence identity with the R/B proteins that regulate the expression of genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and Southwestern gel blots indicate that this protein binds specifically to the CAACGTG motif within the 31-bp sequence. However, by itself, the OsBP-5 protein is unable to trans-activate a lacZ reporter gene controlled by the 31-bp sequence when tested in a yeast expression system. Interestingly, OsBP-5 can trans-activate this reporter gene when another protein, OsEBP-89, a member of the EREBP family of transcription factors, is present. Furthermore, in vitro pull-down experiments show that a protein isolated from developing rice endosperm interacts with the OsBP-5 protein, and Western blots confirm that the interacting protein is OsEBP-89. The formation of a supershift band in EMSAs also indicates that two proteins interact with each other. Interference of OsBP-5 gene expression by double-stranded RNA reduces the amylose content in mature seed of transgenic rice plants but has no visible effect on their phenotype. These results suggest that the OsBP-5 and OsEBP-89 proteins act synergistically, perhaps as a heterodimer, to regulate the transcription of the rice Wx gene.

Appropriately regulated gene expression is a fundamental aspect of most biological phenomena, including development, differentiation, and an organisms ability to respond to environmental signals, and some of the most important regulatory mechanisms act at the level of transcription. Indeed, a large number of proteins have been shown to function as trans-acting activators of transcription. These transcription factors bind specifically to cis-acting sequences of the genes that they regulate, and in many cases these DNA-protein interactions are required for the genes to be transcribed. In some instances, DNA-binding proteins have been shown to stimulate RNA polymerase II-catalyzed transcription in vitro. In other cases, heterodimers or larger complexes formed by two or more different proteins must bind to cis-acting elements before a gene can be transcribed. In fact, heterodimers are known to play important roles in regulating the temporal and spatial expression of many genes and in controlling the development of tissues and organs of both animals and plants (1Singh K.B.

The DEFICIENS (DEF) and GLOBOSA (GLO) proteins of Antirrhinum are transcription factors that contain a MADS-box, a DNA-binding domain, and a K-box. The results of detailed functional analyses of the floral homeotic gene DEF demonstrated that combinatorial regulatory interactions occur between the DEF and GLO proteins (2Zachgo S. Silva E.A. Motte P. Trobner W. Saedler H. Schwarz-Sommer Z. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 2861-2875PubMed Google Scholar). In rice, the OsMADS4 protein, a member of the phosphatidylinositol family, is involved in controlling the development of the second and third flower whorls. Another rice protein, OsMADS16, contains a phosphatidylinositol-derived motif and belongs to the AP3 family. The results of studies on the interactions between Os-MADS4 and OsMADS16 and flower development in rice indicate that OsMADS4 and OsMADS16 form heterodimers that play important roles in specifying sepal and petal identities (3Moon Y.H. Jang J.Y. Kang H.G. An G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In barley, HvGAMYB is a MYB transcription factor synthesized in barley aleurone cells in response to gibberelin during germination. HvGAMYB has been shown to interact with PB-binding factor BPBF to control the expression of the Hor2 gene during endosperm development (4Diaz I. Vicente-Carbajosa J. Abraham Z. Martinez M.

Anthocyanins are a class of secondary metabolites that are widespread in the plant kingdom, and protein heterodimers play an important role in regulating the transcription of genes encoding enzymes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. The transcription of these structural genes is coordinately regulated by at least two classes of regulatory genes. One class, the R/B gene family, encodes proteins with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviation used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assaysdsRNAidouble-stranded RNA interferenceNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosideADHalcohol dehydrogenase.1The abbreviation used are: bHLHbasic helix-loop-helixEMSAelectrophoresis mobility shift assaysdsRNAidouble-stranded RNA interferenceNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidPVDFpolyvinylidene difluorideX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosideADHalcohol dehydrogenase. region, a domain present in MYC proteins. The other class is the C1/pl gene family. C1/pl genes encode proteins that have homology to the DNA-binding domains of MYB proteins. The members of these two sets of transcription factors exhibit tissue-specific patterns of synthesis. The observed spatial and temporal distribution of anthocyanins in maize tissues is caused by the differential expression of the regulatory genes. Interestingly, activation of the genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes requires both an R/B protein and a C1/pl protein. Neither protein can induce the transcription of these genes by itself (5Goff S.A. Cone K.C. Chandler V.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 864-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have demonstrated that the combination of R and C1 is responsible for pigmentation in kernels, whereas the combination of B and pl is responsible for pigmentation in the tissues of mature plants (6Mol J. Jenkins G. Schafer E. Weiss D. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1996; 15: 525-557Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The importance of this type of combinatorial control has also been documented in studies carried out with transgenic tobacco and Arabidopsis plants (7Lloyd A.M. Walbolt V. Davis R.W.

Starch is the major constituent and energy reserve in many important foods, including the seeds of cereal grains and the potato tuber. Starch consists of two types of polysaccharides: amylose and amylopectin. Amylose makes up ∼0–30% of the starch in the cereal grains. The amylose content varies widely in different plant species and even in different cultivars of same species. Studies on starch mutants of maize, rice, and barley have shown that the enzyme granule-bound starch synthase, encoded by the waxy (Wx) gene, catalyzes the synthesis of amylose. In these studies, Wx transcripts could be detected only in the endosperm, pollen, and embryo sac, indicating that the expression of the Wx gene is probably regulated at the level of transcription. We previously cloned and sequenced the Wx gene of rice (8Wang Z.Y. Wu Z.L. Ying Y.Y. Zheng F.Q. Guo X.L. Zhang W.G. Hong M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Wang Z.Y. Zheng F.Q. Gao J.P. Wang X.Q. Wu M. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Sci. China Ser. B Chem. Life Sci. Earth Sci. 1994; 37: 437-447Google Scholar) and demonstrated that the sequences within the first intron of the gene enhance its expression (10Li Y.Z. Ma H.M. Zhang J.L. Wang Z.Y. Hong M.M. Plant Sci. 1995; 108: 181-190Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additional studies revealed that post-transcriptional events play important roles in regulating the concentrations of Wx protein and the amylose in rice seeds (11Wang Z.Y. Zheng F.Q. Shen G.Z. Gao J.P. Snustad D.P. Li M.G. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Plant J. 1995; 7: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that a sequence (–860 to –640) upstream (5′) from the rice Wx gene is a positive regulator of its expression (12Yao C.P. Wang Z.Y. Cai X.L. Zhang D. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1996; 22 (in Chinese): 431-436Google Scholar). The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that a 31-bp nucleotide sequence (–840 to –810) located within the –860 to –640 region is the binding site for nuclear proteins isolated from developing rice seeds (13Chen L. Wang Z.Y. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1997; 23 (in Chinese): 313-318Google Scholar). Furthermore, experiments performed on transgenic rice plants containing a GUS reporter gene controlled by the Wx promoter with the 31-bp sequence present synthesized 2–3 times the amount of GUS as plants carrying the reporter gene and a Wx promoter with the 31-bp sequence deleted (14Ge H.F. Wang Z.Y. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 2000; 26 (in Chinese): 159-163Google Scholar). These results all indicate that the 31-bp sequence plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of the rice Wx gene. More recently, we have used a yeast one-hybrid system to identify cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate Wx gene expression. We constructed a one-hybrid system in which rice cDNAs were fused to the GAL4 activating domain (in plasmid pPC86), and the 31-bp Wx promoter sequence was inserted upstream of the lacZ reporter gene (in plasmid p178). After several rounds of selection, three cDNAs (C5, C89, C73) were isolated from a rice cDNA expression library (15Chen L. Wang Z.Y. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1999; 25 (in Chinese): 110-114Google Scholar). In this paper, we present results showing that cDNA C5 encodes a MYC protein (OsBP-5) that interacts with an EREBP protein (OsEBP-89) to regulate Wx transcription. The heterodimers formed by these two proteins efficiently up-regulated the expression of a lacZ reporter gene in yeast cells transformed with plasmid p178–6×31, which carries a lacZ reporter gene controlled by a mini-promoter and six tandem copies of the Wx 31-bp promoter sequence. In addition, we used double-stranded RNA interference (dsRNAi) to decrease OsBP-5 gene expression and observed a correlation between the decreased levels of OsBP-5 mRNA and amylose content in seeds of the transgenic plants carrying the dsRNAi construct. RNA Gel-blot Analyses—Total RNAs were isolated, and Northern blots were performed as described previously (16Zheng F.Q. Wang Z.Y. Gao J.P. Plant Physiol. Commun. 1993; 29 (in Chinese): 438-440Google Scholar). RNA samples (100 μg each) from endosperms, roots and leaves of Oryza sativa (japonica ZhongHua 11 cultivar) were separated on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde (final concentration: 2.2 m), transferred to nylon membranes (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60Google Scholar), and hybridized to 32P-labeled cDNA C5. The cDNA was labeled by using [32P]dATP as a substrate and a random primer DNA labeling kit (TaKaRa). Protein Synthesis in Escherichia coli—A 1430-bp SalI-NotI restriction fragment containing the C5 cDNA was inserted into vector pET28C(+) (Novagen) in-frame to construct plasmid pET5, and pET5 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3). The resulting His-tagged fusion protein (P5H) was extracted and purified by using a Ni-NTA resin and the protocol provided by the supplier (Qiagen). Southwestern Blots—Southwestern blots were performed as described by Schmitz et al. (18Schmitz M.L. Maier U.G. Brown J.W.S. Feix G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1467-1472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total proteins (100 μg samples) from E. coli strains BL21/pET28C (+) and BL21/pET5, along with purified protein P5H (1 μg), were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto PVDF (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. The proteins on the membranes were then incubated in renaturation buffer (50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-Cl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The 31-bp Wx promoter sequence (32P-labeled) was used as the radioactive probe, and unlabeled 31-bp sequence was used as a specific competitor in these assays and in the EMSA experiments described below. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Competition Experiments—Both strands of the 31-bp nucleotide sequence (GCAACGTGCCAACGTACGCACGCTAACGTGA) were synthesized, annealed, and inserted into vector pUC18. A plasmid (designated pUC31bp) that contained two tandem copies of the 31-bp nucleotide sequence was used in EMSAs. The DNA fragment containing the 31-bp sequence was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and labeled by using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to catalyze nick-translation in the presence of [32P]dATP. Both strands of the 31-bp sequence (L strand, GCAACGTGCCAACGTA and R strand, CGCACGCTAACGTGA) and two mutant sequences of the left strand (LM1, GTAACATGCCAACGTA and LM2, GCAACGTGCTAACATA) were synthesized, annealed, and labeled by using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [32P]ATP. EMSAs were performed as follows: 10 fmol of labeled probe was mixed with 0.2 μg of Ni-NTA-purified fusion protein, 4 μg of calf thymus DNA, with or without competitor DNA, in a DNA-binding buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. After incubating the DNA-binding mixtures at 25 °C for 20 min, they were subjected to electrophoresis on 4% acrylamide gels containing TBE (22.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 0.25 mm EDTA). The gels were subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray film. trans-Activation Assays—A yeast one-hybrid system was constructed from the DupLEX-A two-hybrid system (Origene). Recombinant plasmids used in the trans-activation experiments were constructed by inserting cDNAs C5 and C89LH (a full-length cDNA produced from the transcript of the OsEBP-89 gene) into plasmid pEG202 (HIS3, 2 μm, Apr, ADH constitutive promoter, LexA DNA-binding domain, and SV40 nuclear localization signal). The resulting plasmids or plasmid pEG202 were individually introduced into cells of yeast strain EGY48 (MATα trp1his3ura3leu2::6lexAop-LEU2) harboring the reporter plasmid pSH18–34 (URA3, 2 μm, Apr, LexAops-lacZ). The resulting yeast transformants were grown on SD medium (35Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 14Google Scholar) in the presence of tryptophan and leucine, but no histidine or uracil, for 2–3 days at 30 °C. The SD medium was then overlaid with a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated on X-gal plates for 12–24 h at 30 °C. In Vitro Pull-down Assays—Nuclear proteins were isolated from developing endosperm cells by the protocol of Takaiwa (19Takaiwa F. Oono K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1990; 224: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the P5H fusion protein was synthesized in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells. Total proteins isolated from E. coli BL21/pET5 cells were dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole) and passed though two Ni-NTA-resin columns. One column was washed three times with buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole), and the resin-bound proteins were removed with an elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole). The nuclear proteins isolated from endosperm cells and p5H fusion protein were then passed through a second Ni-NTA-resin column, washed, and eluted as described above. As a control assay, the same nuclear extracts from developing endosperm cells were added to the third column, washed, and eluted as described above. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transfered to PVDF membranes. Western blots were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60Google Scholar) by using a 1:100 dilution of the anti-OsEBP-89 rabbit antisera and a 1:3000 dilution of an alkaline phosphatase conjugate of the secondary antibody (Sigma anti-rabbit IgG). Detection was performed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium (Sigma) as substrate. The protein gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described by Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60Google Scholar). Yeast Two-hybrid System I—A DupLEX-A yeast two-hybrid system (Origene) was used in the initial experiments. The C5 cDNA was inserted into the BamHI and NotI sites of plasmid pEG202 to produce bait plasmid pEGC5, and cDNAs C89LH, C73, myb12, myb13, myb14, and REB were each inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of plasmid pJG4–5 (TRP1, 2 μm, Apr, inducible Gal1 promoter, B42 activation domain) to produce prey plasmids pJGC89LH, pJGC73, pJGmyb12, pJGmyb13, pJGmyb14, and pJGREB, respectively. Each of these prey plasmids was transformed into yeast cells harboring both the bait plasmid pEGC5 and the reporter plasmid pSH18–34. The resulting yeast transformants were grown on SD medium containing leucine, but lacking histidine, uracil, and tryptophan, for 2–3 days at 30 °C. The SD medium was then overlaid with a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated on X-gal plates for 12–24 h at 30 °C. Yeast Two-hybrid System II—A DNA fragment containing six copies of the 31-bp Wx promoter sequence was excised from plasmid pUC-6×31 by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII and inserted into yeast plasmid p178 (URA3, 2 μm, Apr, mini-promoter-lacZ) to form reporter plasmid p178–6×31. The expression of the lacZ reporter gene in plasmid p178–6×31 should, therefore, be driven by the tandemly repeated 31-bp cis-element. The C5 cDNA was then inserted into plasmid pPC86Gal4AD– (TRP1, 2 μm, Apr, ADC1 promoter, Gal4 activation domain deleted) to form plasmid pC5Gal4AD–, and cDNA C89SX (containing the coding sequence for amino acids 1–278 of protein OsEBP-89) was inserted into plasmid pEG202 to form the derivative pEG89SX. The reporter plasmid p178–6×31 was co-transformed into yeast cells with either pC5Gal4AD–, pEG89SX, or both co-transformants were grown on SD medium containing histidine and leucine, tryptophan, and leucine, or just leucine, for 2–3 days at 30 °C. The resulting colonies were then overlaid with nitrocellulose membranes and incubated on X-gal plates for 12 to 24 h at 30 °C. Quantitative Assays of β-Galactosidase Activity—Mid-to-late exponential-phase yeast cells were collected, resuspended in buffer Z (0.06 mol/liter Na2HPO4·7H2O, 0.4 mol/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 0.01 mol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.05 mol/liter β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described by Miller (20Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) using o-nitrophenyl-β-galactophyranoside as the substrate. Activity units were calculated as 1000 × A420/(A600 × assay time in minutes × assay volume in milliliters). Transformation of Rice—Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of rice was performed as previously described (21Hiei Y. Ohta S. Komari T. Kumashiro T. Plant J. 1994; 6: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar, 22Liu Q.Q. Zhang J.L. Wang Z.Y. Hong M.M. Gu M.H. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1998; 24 (in Chinese): 259-275Google Scholar). Construction of Chimeric Genes for Use in Double-stranded RNA Interference Experiments—A schematic diagram of the RNAi construct is shown in Fig. 10A. Plasmid p13UGN was constructed by inserting a 2.0-kb sequence containing the promoter of Ubi gene, a 1.84-b GUS coding region, and a 0.26-b Nos terminator into the HindIII and BamHI sites, the BamHI and SacI sites, and the SacI and EcoRI sites, respectively, of plasmid pCAMBIA1300. A 450-p gene-specific segment of the OsBP-5 cDNA (+81 to +612) was inserted into the SacI site of p13UGN in the sense orientaion and the same fragment was inserted into BamHI and SalI sites in the antisense orientation to produce plasmid p13dsC5. Determination of the Amylose Content of Rice Seeds—The amylose content of mature seeds was measured by the colorimetric method performed using iodine-potassium iodide as described previously (23Juliano B.O. Cereal Sci. Today. 1971; 16: 334-338Google Scholar). The OsBP-5 Gene of Rice Encodes a New MYC Protein Containing a bHLH DNA-binding Domain—Our previous data demonstrated that a 31-bp nucleotide sequence in the up-stream region of the rice Wx gene interacted with nuclear proteins extracted from developing rice endosperm (13Chen L. Wang Z.Y. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1997; 23 (in Chinese): 313-318Google Scholar). Three cDNA clones (pC5, pC73, pC89) were isolated from a rice cDNA expression library by using the 31-bp nucleotide sequence as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screening protocol (15Chen L. Wang Z.Y. Zhang J.L. Hong M.M. Acta Phytophysiol. Sin. 1999; 25 (in Chinese): 110-114Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the results of studies on the structure and function of one of these cDNAs (C5) and the protein that it encodes. The C5 cDNA contains 1430 bp and encodes a protein 335 amino acids long. The predicted product of this gene contains a typical bHLH-ZIP domain, which exhibits about 50% amino acid sequence identity and 70% similarity with the R/B proteins of maize. The R/B proteins are MYC-like transcription factors that control anthocyanin accumulation in maize. Outside of the bHLH-ZIP domain, the C5 protein bears little similarity to any known protein, including the R/B proteins. Thus, C5 appears to be a new MYC-like protein. The sequence of the C5 cDNA has been deposited in the GenBank™/EBI Data Base (accession number AJ487830). The results of Northern blot hybridization experiments demonstrated that the transcript of the OsBP-5 gene is ∼1.4 kb in length and is synthesized in several tissues including endosperm, leaves, and roots of rice plants (Fig. 1). The OsBP-5 Protein Binds Specifically to the CAACGTG Box in the 31-bp Sequence of the Wx Promoter—To confirm that the protein encoded by cDNA C5 can interact with the 31-bp nucleotide sequence, the cDNA was expressed in E. coli to produce a fusion protein (designated P5H) containing six histidine residues at its N terminus. The P5H protein was purified by affinity chromatography and used in Southwestern blot experiments. The E. coli proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, renatured, and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Fig. 2A). A 32P-labeled 31-bp oligonucleotide (equivalent to the 31-bp sequence in the Wx promoter) was incubated with the bound P5H protein on the membrane. The DNA-protein band present at the P5H position on the gel indicates that P5H does indeed bind to the 31-bp element (Fig. 2B). When unlabeled 31-bp sequence was added to the binding solution as a specific competitor, the resulting DNA-protein band was much lighter (Fig. 2C). The ability of protein P5H to bind in a sequence-specific manner to the 31-bp sequence was further confirmed by EMSA experiments. In these assays, a strong band shift was produced after incubation of 10 fmol of 32P-labeled probe with 0.2 μg of protein P5H under binding conditions (Fig. 3, lane 2). The band shift gradually disappeared in the presence of increasing amounts of specific competitor-unlabeled 31-bp probe (Fig. 3, lanes 3, 5, and 7). However, a strong band shift was still observed when plasmid pUC18 DNA was added to the binding reactions as a nonspecific competitor (Fig. 3, lanes 4, 6, and 8). MYC-like proteins are known to bind to E-box sequences (CACGTG) in DNA. However, studies on the binding of Myc-Mad complexes to random oligonucleotides in vitro revealed that these proteins also bind to a number of other non-canonical sequences with lower affinity (24Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). One of these non-canonical sequences is CAACGTG. We noticed that both the CAACGTG sequence and the CAACGTG-like sequence CAACGTA are located near the left (5′) end of 31-bp sequence. To determine whether the CAACGTG sequence is a binding site of protein P5H, two fragments (L and R) derived from the left and right halves, respectively, of the 31-bp sequence were synthesized and 32P-labeled separately. Subsequently, variant L fragments (LM1 fragment = TAACATG and LM2 fragment = TAACATA) (Fig. 4) were also synthesized and used as probes in EMSA assays. The results of these experiments showed that protein P5H did bind to fragments L and LM2 but not to fragments R and LM1 (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the CAACGTG sequence, and not CAACGTA, is the DNA binding site recognized by protein P5H. Analysis of the trans-Activation Ability of Protein OsBP-5—We tested whether protein OsBP-5 has trans-activation ability in a yeast one-hybrid system derived from the DupLEX-A yeast two-hybrid system. Fig. 5A shows the structures of the effector and reporter constructs used in the trans-activation assays. Plasmids pEGC89LH and pEG202 were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Plasmids pEGC5, pEGC89LH, and pEG202 were introduced separately into yeast cells harboring reporter plasmid pSH18–34. All of the transformants grew on SD plates containing leucine and tryptophan, but lacking histidine and uracil (data not shown), indicating that the transformations were successful. When these transformants were transferred to plates containing the same media plus X-gal, only the cells containing both plasmids pEGC89LH and pSH18–34 turned blue. Cells co-transformed with plasmids pEGC5 and pSH18–34 remained white, just like the negative controls (Fig. 5B). Thus, protein OsBP-5 does not seem to have trans-activation ability, unless the OsBP5-LexA fusion protein was, for some reason, not synthesized in the transformed yeast cells. However, please note that the results presented in the next section indicate that the fusion protein is synthesized in yeast cells. An EREBP Protein Interacts with Protein OsBP-5—Many MYC-like proteins do not have the ability, by themseleves, to activate target gene expression in either plants or animals. The regulation of target gene expression often requires a combinatorial interaction between a MYC-like protein and another transcription factor. To determine whether other rice proteins might interact with OsBP-5, the DupLEX-A yeast two-hybrid s"

Many GPCRs undergo agonist-mediated internalization through arrestin-dependent mechanisms, wherein arrestin serves as an adapter between the receptor and endocytic proteins. To understand the role of arrestins in N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) trafficking, we stably expressed the FPR in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (MEF) that lacked endogenous arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 (arrestin-deficient). We compared FPR internalization and recycling kinetics in these cells to congenic wild type MEF cell lines. Internalization of the FPR was not altered in the absence of arrestins. Since the FPR remains associated with arrestins following internalization, we investigated whether the rate of FPR recycling was altered in arrestin-deficient cells. While the FPR was able to recycle in the wild type cells, receptor recycling was largely absent in the arrestin double knockout cells. Reconstitution of the arrestin-deficient line with either arrestin 2 or arrestin 3 restored receptor recycling. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies demonsrated that in arrestin-deficient cells the FPR may become trapped in the perinuclear recycling compartment. These observations indicate that, although the FPR can internalize in the absence of arrestins, recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface is prevented. Our results suggest a novel role for arrestins in the post-endocytic trafficking of GPCRs.

Agonist binding to the receptor triggers exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα-subunit of the G protein and consequently the dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ-dimer. Both subunits can regulate the activity of multiple effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. Within seconds of receptor activation, the receptor becomes phosphorylated by GPCR kinases, which increases the affinity of the receptor for cytosolic proteins called arrestins (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar).Arrestin binding to GPCRs prevents receptors from further association with G proteins thereby playing an important role in GPCR desensitization. In addition, arrestin binding can subsequently target receptors to coated pits via associations with clathrin, the clathrin adaptor AP-2, and the intracellular transport ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (2Krupnick J.G.

Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 73-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Previous work by our laboratory has demonstrated that while arrestins colocalize with the FPR during receptor internalization, a role for arrestins in the trafficking of the FPR has remained elusive (12Bennett T.A.

Overexpression studies in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells employed the clathrin-binding domain of arrestin (arrestin319–418). This arrestin fragment, however, displayed no effect on the internalization of the FPR in HEK293 cells (14Gilbert T.L. Bennett T.A. Maestas D.C. Cimino D.F. Prossnitz E.R. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 40: 3467-3475Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). While it is thought that normal arrestin functions are blocked by expression of this domain, since HEK cells express endogenous arrestin, it remains unclear whether the FPR is capable of internalization via an arrestin-dependent pathway that is not blocked by the arrestin319–418 peptide. Additional studies using FPR mutants containing only distinct subsets of the potential phosphorylation sites within the carboxyl terminus of the FPR, which do not form stable associations with arrestin, are still capable of ligand-induced internalization (13Bennett T.A.

However, although no binding of arrestins to these mutant receptors was observed either in vitro or in vivo, it is unclear whether these mutants could form a low affinity transient association sufficient to permit internalization.Two arrestins are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells, arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 (17McDonald P.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Differential roles and cellular distributions have been observed for arrestin 2 and arrestin 3, demonstrating these two proteins exhibit distinct properties (18Scott M.G. Le Rouzic E. Perianin A.

To define the physiological roles of arrestins 2 and 3 in the trafficking of the FPR, we have used cell lines generated from arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Previous studies using such cell lines have demonstrated that the β2-adrenergic receptor exhibits an absolute requirement for arrestin in internalization, whereas internalization of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor is reduced by ∼75% in the absence of arrestins (20Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar). Studies of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1 or thrombin receptor) demonstrated that internalization of this receptor was not dependent on the presence of arrestin (21Paing M.M. Stutts A.B.

Using these MEF cell lines that lack arrestins, we have analyzed the contribution of arrestins to both the internalization and recycling of the FPR.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—fMLF (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) and N-fNleLFNleYK (6pep) were purchased from Sigma. fNleLFNleYK-fluorescein (6pep-FITC) was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. fNleLFNleYK-Alexa546 and 633 (6pep-Alexa546 and 633) were synthesized as described previously (22Key T.A.

Plasmid cDNA encoding the FLAG-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor and arrestin 2 (generously provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic), the wild type FPR, or the ΔST mutant FPR was subcloned into the pLHCX retroviral vector (Clontech) and the resulting virus transduced into MEF cells and selected as described previously (24Pear W.S.

Surviving cells were pooled and FPR expression was confirmed by measuring the binding of 10 nm fNleLFNleYK-fluorescein by flow cytometry.Internalization and Recycling Assays—Cells were harvested, rinsed in serum-free DMEM, and allowed to equilibrate to 37 °C for 10 min. Receptor internalization was initiated by the addition of unlabeled 1 μm fMLF. At the indicated time points (or for 60 min for the recycling assays), cells were transferred to ice cold DMEM and the unbound ligand was removed by four washes in ice-cold serum-free DMEM. For recycling assays, cells were resuspended in prewarmed (37 °C) DMEM and allowed to incubate for the indicated time periods. The receptors on the surface of the cells were labeled with 6pep-FITC. In the recycling assays, when cells had been transfected with arrestin 2-GFP or arrestin 3-GFP (kindly provided by Dr. Jeffrey Benovic), 6pep-Alexa633 was used to detect recycled cell surface receptors. The receptors were quantified by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).

Cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) onto glass slides. Fluorescence images were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe FPR Undergoes Arrestin-independent Internalization—To examine the role of arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 in the regulation of FPR trafficking, we stably expressed the wild type FPR and a ΔST FPR mutant in five independently isolated MEF cell lines. These consisted of two wild type lines (WT1 and WT2), and MEF cell lines in which arrestin 2 (Arr2–/–), arrestin 3 (Arr3–/–), or both arrestin 2/arrestin 3 (Arr2–/–/3–/–) were homozygously deleted (20Kohout T.A.

The ΔST FPR mutant lacks all of the potential serine or threonine phosphorylation sites found in the carboxyl terminus and has been shown to mediate ligand-induced calcium fluxes but not to undergo ligand-induced internalization or desensitization (11Prossnitz E.R.

To determine whether internalization of the wild type FPR was regulated by arrestins, we assessed the ability of the WT FPR to undergo ligand-induced internalization in each of the five MEF cells lines. The wild type receptors were rapidly internalized in both wild type MEF cell lines (WT1 and WT2) with t1/2 values of ∼7 min and a total of 60–70% of the cell surface receptor being internalized (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, the ΔST FPR mutant demonstrated very little reduction in cell surface expression over the 30-min stimulation period. Similar rates and extents of FPR internalization were also observed in both the Arr 2–/– and Arr 3–/– single knock-out MEF cell lines, indicating that neither arrestin 2 nor arrestin 3 was individually required for FPR internalization (Table I). We next examined the rate of FPR internalization in the arrestin double knock-out cell line. In these cells, the WT FPR internalized to the same extent as the WT cell lines (Fig. 1B). As expected, the ΔST mutant failed to internalize.Table IInternalization of the FPR and β2AR in MEF cell linesCell linet½Extent of receptor internalizationmin%Wild type I FPR (WT1 FPR)7.4 ± 1.768 ± 8Wild type 2 FPR (WT2 FPR)7.1 ± 2.058 ± 8Arr2-/- FPR7.9 ± 1.657 ± 6Arr3-/- FPR5.9 ± 2.257 ± 13Arr2-/-3-/- FPR5.1 ± 0.749 ± 3Wild type 1 β2AR5.1 ± 2.728 ± 10Wild type 2 β2AR9.6 ± 4.635 ± 14Arr2-/-3-/- β2ARNDaND, not determinable.0 ± 6a ND, not determinable.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar), we examined internalization of a GPCR which internalizes solely by an arrestin-dependent pathway. In the presence of isoproterenol stimulation, the transfected β2-adrenergic receptor was internalized in the wild type cell lines but not in the double knock-out cell line (Fig. 1C and Table I). These results confirmed that in the absence of arrestins, the FPR is capable of ligand-induced internalization.The FPR Fails to Recycle following Internalization in Arrestin-deficient Cells—Although arrestins were not required for trafficking of the FPR during receptor internalization, arrestins have been shown to regulate the recycling of GPCRs (29Anborgh P.H.

Studies comparing the ability of different GPCRs to recycle have suggested that those GPCRs (such as the β2-adrenergic receptor) that rapidly dissociate from arrestin and are not observed to be associated with arrestin in endosomes recycle rapidly. On the contrary, GPCRs (such as the V2 vasopressin receptor) that are seen to remain stably associated with arrestin in endosomes recycle slowly if at all. These observations led us to examine the ability of the FPR to recycle in the absence of arrestin. As arrestin remains associated with the FPR on endosomes, we hypothesized that in the absence of arrestin, the FPR might recycle more rapidly. In the wild type MEF cell lines, the FPR recycled rapidly with t ½ values of ∼5 min, while 50–60% of the internalized FPR recycled by 20 min (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the arrestin double knock-out MEF cell line failed to promote recycling of the FPR.Fig. 2Arrestin-deficient MEF cells fail to recycle the FPR following internalization. A, wild type and arrestin 2–/–/3–/– MEF cells transfected with the FPR were incubated in the presence of 1 μm fMLF for 60 min at 37 °C. Uninternalized ligand was removed by washing on ice. Internalized receptor was subsequently allowed to recycle at 37 °C for the indicated time periods. Recycled receptor was labeled with 6pep-FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry (n = 3). B, reconstitution of arr2–/–/3–/–FPR MEF cells with arrestin restores recycling. Cells were transiently transfected with arrestin 2-GFP, arrestin 3-GFP, or GFP vector alone and assayed for recycling as above but using 6pep-Alexa633 to quantitate recycled receptors. Gates were set to analyze GFP-expressing cells only (n ≥ 5).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reconstitution with Arrestin Restores Recycling of the FPR— Since the cell lines used in this study were spontaneously immortalized and individual isolates of MEF cells have been shown to exhibit significant variability in the extent of GPCR internalization (20Kohout T.A. Lin F.-T. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 98: 1601-1606Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether there were any differences in the rates or extents of recycling mediated by either arrestin 2 or 3. To this end, we transiently transfected the Arr2–/–/3–/– MEF cell lines stably expressing the FPR with either arrestin 2-GFP or arrestin 3-GFP fusion proteins or GFP alone as a control. Both arrestin 2 and arrestin 3 were capable of rescuing the recycling of the FPR to similar extents (Fig. 2B). These results confirm that the FPR internalized in the absence of arrestin is incapable of recycling.The FPR Accumulates in Perinuclear Recycling Endosomes in the Absence of Arrestins—To determine whether the distribution of the internalized FPR in the cell is altered in the absence of arrestins, we examined the localization of the FPR, formyl peptide ligand, arrestin 2, and Rab11, a marker of the perinuclear recycling endosome compartment (32Rosenfeld J.L. Knoll B.J. Moore R.H. Recept. Channels. 2002; 8: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In unstimulated wild type MEF cells, the FPR was localized to the plasma membrane, arrestin was found throughout the cytosol in a somewhat punctate pattern, and Rab11 existed predominantly in the perinuclear recycling endosome compartment as well as in distinct vesicles (Fig. 3). Upon stimulation of the FPR, the receptor and arrestin colocalized extensively in intracellular vesicles throughout the cytosol. A fraction of these vesicles colocalized with the Rab11 marker, both in the cytosol as well as in the perinuclear recycling compartment. A similar pattern was observed for arrestin double knockout cells transfected with arrestin 2. However, in arrestin-deficient double knockout cells, the FPR and its fluorescent ligand were highly concentrated in the perinuclear recycling compartment with little ligand/receptor being present in vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. The distribution of Rab11 in the arrestin double knockout cells appeared similar to that in the wild type cells. Finally, to determine whether arrestins may serve a similar function in leukocytes, the principle site of FPR expression, we examined the distribution of the FPR, arrestins, and Rab11 in U937 myeloid cells. As in wild type MEF cells, the FPR and arrestin colocalized extensively yet only a fraction of the receptor/arrestin complex was found associated with the perinuclear recycling compartment.Fig. 3Arrestin-deficient MEF cells accumulate the FPR in perinuclear recycling endosomes. Parental wild type (WT) and arrestin double knock-out MEF cells (KO) were transiently transfected with FPR-mRFP1 and Rab11-GFP (rows 1, 2, and 4) or FPR-mRFP1, arrestin 2, and Rab11-GFP (row 3). FPR-expressing U937 cells were transfected with Rab11-GFP (row 5). Cells were incubated with 10 nm fMLF (rows 2 and 3) or 10 nm fluorecent formyl peptide (rows 4 and 5) for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-arrestin 2 antibodies followed by Cy5-conjugated secondary antibodies. In all situations where parallel experiments were carried out with fluorescent ligand and FPR-mRFP1, extensive colocalization between the receptor and ligand was observed. Data are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Conclusions—Arrestins are thought to regulate the internalization and desensitization of many GPCRs. While arrestins have been observed to cluster with the FPR in response to ligand binding and receptor activation, a role for arrestin in the regulation of the FPR has remained unclear. We found that although FPR internalization was not dependent on the presence of either arrestin 2 or arrestin 3, similar to previous results with PAR1 (21Paing M.M. Stutts A.B. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Trejo J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1292-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), FPR recycling to the plasma membrane was inhibited in the absence of arrestins.How arrestins are involved in regulating the recycling of the FPR is not yet known. Recycling of GPCRs is thought to occur following endosome acidification, arrestin dissociation, and receptor dephosphorylation as the receptor traffics through multiple vesicular compartments in the cytosol. Since arrestins serve as adaptors for many proteins, it is intriguing to speculate that arrestins may specifically regulate the post-endocytic intracellular trafficking of GPCRs or possibly even regulate the binding/activity of phosphatases. Thus, FPR internalized in the absence of arrestin binding may traffic improperly within the cell resulting in intracellular retention and commensurate recycling defects. In wild type cells, therefore, one role for arrestin may be the proper targeting of the wild type receptor to or from a recycling compartment. Our results suggest that in the absence of arrestins, the FPR becomes concentrated in perinuclear recycling endosomes, indicating that arrestin may have a role in the progression of the FPR through this compartment. The precise mechanisms involved in this trafficking defect, however, remain to be determined. It is interesting to note that the V2 vasopressin receptor that does not recycle upon endocytosis also accumulates in the perinuclear recycling compartment, though in this case with arrestin colocalizing with the receptor (30Innamorati G. Le Gouill C. Balamotis M. Birnbaumer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13096-13103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the associations of arrestins with GPCRs are complex and that as more GPCRs are characterized, novel modes of regulation by arrestins are likely to be described. The FPR is only the second GPCR that has been found to internalize in the absence of arrestins 2 and 3, but the first receptor demonstrated not to recycle in the absence of arrestins. We propose that the FPR may define a third class of GPCRs, which can be internalized in the absence of arrestins but requires arrestins for proper trafficking and/or recycling.

Agonist binding to the receptor triggers exchange of GDP for GTP on the Gα-subunit of the G protein and consequently the dissociation of the α subunit from the βγ-dimer. Both subunits can regulate the activity of multiple effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C. Within seconds of receptor activation, the receptor becomes phosphorylated by GPCR kinases, which increases the affinity of the receptor for cytosolic proteins called arrestins (1Lefkowitz R.J. J.

This pathway induces a cell cycle arrest that persists until the damage is repaired. Consequently, the failure to arrest in response to DNA damage is associated with genomic instability. In budding yeast, activation of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway leads to a mitotic cell cycle arrest. Following the detection of DNA damage, the checkpoint signal is transduced via the Mec1 kinase, which in turn activates two kinases, Rad53 and Chk1 that act in parallel pathways to bring about the cell cycle arrest. The downstream target of Rad53 is unknown. The target of Chk1 is Pds1, an inhibitor of anaphase initiation whose degradation is a prerequisite for mitotic progression. Pds1 degradation is dependent on its ubiquitination by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome ubiquitin ligase, acting in conjunction with the Cdc20 protein (APC/CCdc20). Previous studies showed that the Rad53 and Chk1 pathways independently lead to Pds1 stabilization but the mechanism for this was unknown. In the present study we show that both the Chk1 and the Rad53 pathways inhibit the APC/CCdc20-dependent ubiquitination of Pds1 but they affect different steps of the process: the Rad53 pathway inhibits the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction whereas Chk1-dependent phosphorylation of Pds1 inhibits the ubiquitination reaction itself. Finally, we show that once the DNA damage is repaired, Pds1 dephosphorylation is involved in the recovery from the checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest.

Finally, we show that once the DNA damage is repaired, Pds1 dephosphorylation is involved in the recovery from the checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest. The ability to sense and properly respond to the presence of DNA damage is crucial for cell viability, and DNA strand breaks that persist through mitosis can lead to the loss or gain of large chromosome fragments, resulting in aneuploidy. Cells have the ability to detect DNA damage and respond by activating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism known as the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (1Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in ensuring cellular integrity, defects in several checkpoint proteins enhance sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and cause genomic instability (2Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The checkpoint response leads to the transcriptional activation of numerous DNA repair genes; concomitantly, it induces a cell cycle arrest that provides the cell with a window of time during which DNA repair can take place. In higher eukaryotes, the DNA damage checkpoint pathway may induce apoptosis (3Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E277-E286Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Importantly, if cells are not led down the apoptotic route, the cell cycle will resume once the damage is repaired.In most metazoans, one of the main arrest points of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway is in G2, when entry into mitosis is prevented via the inactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 (4Walworth N.C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, however, the DNA damage checkpoint pathway does not control cell cycle progression by inactivating the Cdk1 equivalent, Cdc28 (5Amon A. Surana U. Muroff I. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 355: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Instead, this checkpoint pathway induces a mitotic arrest by inhibiting the metaphase to anaphase transition. This is accomplished, at least in part, by preventing the degradation of the mitotic regulator Pds1, as cells lacking Pds1 are unable to maintain a mitotic cell cycle arrest in the presence of DNA damage (6Yamamoto A.

Pds1 inhibits anaphase initiation by repressing the anaphase activator Esp1, a protease that dissolves sister chromatid cohesion (11Uhlmann F. Wernic D. Poupart M.A. Koonin E.V. Nasmyth K.

Cdc20 is active early in mitosis and is involved in the ubiquitination of several cell cycle regulators, including Pds1 and the cyclins Clb5 and Clb2 (19Visintin R. Prinz S. Amon A.

Chk1 and Rad53 are on two parallel branches of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, and in budding yeast both are required for a complete metaphase cell cycle arrest (Fig. 1) (8Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3173-3185Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The downstream target of Rad53 that is needed for the mitotic arrest is unknown. The target of Chk1 is Pds1, which is directly phosphorylated by Chk1 (9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Wang H. Liu D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is essential for Pds1 stabilization in the presence of DNA damage (10Wang H. Liu D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but it is currently not known how this stabilization is achieved.An important, yet poorly understood, aspect of the DNA damage checkpoint arrest is the recovery process. This is especially important for a unicellular organism such as budding yeast, where an arrest in response to a sublethal DNA damage dose without the possibility of recovery would be pointless. Only a few proteins involved in this recovery process have been identified thus far (Ref. 23Vaze M.B. Pellicioli A. Lee S.E. Ira G. Liberi G. Arbel-Eden A. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Mol.

We provide evidence that Pds1 ubiquitination is subjected to at least two inhibitory signals, one that is Rad53-dependent and the other that is Chk1-dependent. Our results also provide an insight into the mechanism by which cells recover from the DNA damage-induced checkpoint arrest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—All the strains used in this work are W303 derivatives (MAT a bar1 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3 ade2): OCF1522 (PDS1-HA::URA3) (7Cohen-Fix O.

For the methionine promoter shut-off experiments methionine was used at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml.Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—Yeast cell lysates were prepared by breaking cells with glass beads in buffer A (0.05 m Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors mix from Roche Applied Science). The extract (2 mg of protein) was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with 40 μl of anti-HA antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed extensively in buffer A. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 50 μl of 1× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gel) and analyzed by Western blot analysis. Quantification of the amount of immunoprecipitation was done by densitometry scanning of the results from several independent experiments.Protein Techniques—The preparation of protein extracts and the purification of bacterially expressed Pds1 were as described (25Agarwal R. Cohen-Fix O. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Separation of phosphorylated Pds1 on low cross-linking gels was as described (7Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar).Kinase Assays—Wild-type cells carrying Chk1-HA (pQL10) were grown to log phase at 30 °C in media containing raffinose, after which Chk1 expression was induced from a galactose-inducible promoter for 2 h. Protein extracts were prepared and Chk1-HA was immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies as described above. For radioactive kinase assays, 2.5 μg of purified recombinant Pds1 was mixed with 29 μl of immunoprecipitated Chk1, 1 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml creatine kinase, 35 mm phosphocreatine, 1.3 μCi/μl of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 mm MgCl2 in buffer B (0.05 m Tris-HCl at pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1.25 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) in a total volume of 40 μl. As a control, purified recombinant Pds1 was incubated in the same buffer with the anti-HA immunoprecipitates from a stain that lacked the expression of Chk1-HA. The Chk1 bound or the control beads were removed by centrifugation and radiolabeled Pds1 was used in vitro ubiquitination reactions. The Pds1 protein treated with the control IP was not radiolabeled and used as the control in the ubiquitination assays.In Vitro Ubiquitination Reaction—APC was purified from mitotic Xenopus egg extracts with the anti-Cdc27 (APC3) beads. The anti-Cdc27 beads were incubated with 10 volumes of mitotic Xenopus egg extracts for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times with XB (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm sucrose) containing 500 mm KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and twice with XB. The mitotic APC beads were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with purified recombinant human Cdc20 or Cdh1 proteins expressed in Sf9 insect cells. After incubation, the APC beads were washed twice with XB, and assayed for ubiquitination activity toward either unphosphorylated Pds1 or 32P-labeled Pds1 protein phosphorylated by Chk1. Each ubiquitination assay was performed in a volume of 6 μl at room temperature. The reaction mixture contained 1 mm ATP (Sigma), 150 μm of bovine ubiquitin (Sigma), 5 μm of human E1, 2 μm of UbcH10, 3 μl of the APC beads, and 1 μl of unlabeled Pds1 treated with the control IP or 1 μl of 32P-labeled Pds1 modified by the Chk1 IP (see above). Both preparations of Pds1 had undergone the same treatment prior to the ubiquitination reactions. Samples were taken at the indicated time points, quenched with SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. For the ubiquitination assays of the unlabeled Pds1 protein, the reaction mixtures were immunoblotted with the anti-Pds1 antibody. The intensities of the Pds1-ubiquitin conjugates were quantified with a densitometer. For the assays with the 32P-labeled Pds1 protein, the reactions were analyzed and quantified with a Fuji phosphorimager. In both cases, the intensities of Pds1-ubiquitin conjugates were normalized against their molecular weights. The APC activity was determined as the total normalized intensity of the Pds1-ubiquitin conjugates.RESULTSThe Presence of DNA Damage Blocks the Pds1-Cdc20 Interaction in a Rad53-dependent, Chk1-independent Manner—In budding yeast, the presence of DNA damage activates the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, which stabilizes Pds1, thereby blocking mitotic progression. At least part of this stabilization can be attributed to the phosphorylation of Pds1 by Chk1 (9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Wang H. Liu D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We thus set out to determine how Chk1 phosphorylation inhibits the degradation of Pds1. The electrophoretic mobility of Pds1 extracted from cells that have experienced DNA damage showed that under these conditions Pds1 was phosphorylated, and it did not accumulate as polyubiquitinated forms (7Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This indicated that the stabilization of Pds1 was not due to the inhibition of degradation per se but due to a block at, or prior to, ubiquitination. We have previously shown that Pds1 ubiquitination by its ubiquitin ligase, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) acting in conjunction with Cdc20, depended on the direct interaction between Pds1 and Cdc20 (18Hilioti Z. Chung Y.S. Mochizuki Y. Hardy C.F. Cohen-Fix O. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1347-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To test if the presence of DNA damage stabilizes Pds1 by affecting the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction, we examined whether Pds1 and Cdc20 can be co-immunoprecipitated from protein extracts prepared from DNA damaged cells. DNA damage was induced by exposing cells to γ radiation that created DNA double-strand breaks. In budding yeast the repair of these lesions largely depends on recombinational repair, and thus irradiation of haploid cells in G1, lacking both homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids, generates irreparable DNA damage (26Resnick M.A. Basic Life Sci. 1975; 5B: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar, 27Haber J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Once these cells are released from the G1 arrest, this persistent DNA damage leads to a DNA damage checkpoint-dependent metaphase arrest. Since the non-irradiated control cells would not arrest in metaphase, the strains used in this experiment carried a cdc16 mutant gene that at the non-permissive temperature causes a metaphase arrest due to the inactivation of the Cdc16 subunit of the APC/C. Moreover, because the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction results in the rapid degradation of Pds1, the cdc16 mutation enabled us to capture this transient interaction (18Hilioti Z. Chung Y.S. Mochizuki Y. Hardy C.F. Cohen-Fix O. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1347-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar).To examine whether DNA damage affected the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction we constructed cdc16 mutant strains expressing Myc-tagged Cdc20 and either HA-tagged Pds1 or untagged Pds1 that served as a control. Cells were arrested in G1 with α-mating pheromone, irradiated, and then released form the G1 arrest by removing the pheromone and shifting the cells to 37 °C, the non-permissive temperature for cdc16 mutant strains. Once cells reached the metaphase arrest, the ability of Pds1-HA to interact with Cdc20-Myc was examined by coimmunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2A). As shown previously, in non-irradiated cells, Cdc20-Myc co-immunoprecipitated with Pds1-HA (Fig. 2A, lane 5) but not with an untagged Pds1 control (Fig. 2A, lane 7). In contrast, the presence of DNA damage markedly reduced the interaction between Cdc20-Myc and Pds1-HA (Fig. 2A, lane 6 and Fig. 2E). Given that the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction is essential for the ubiquitination of Pds1 (18Hilioti Z. Chung Y.S. Mochizuki Y. Hardy C.F. Cohen-Fix O. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1347-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), inhibiting this interaction would lead to Pds1 stabilization.Fig. 2The presence of DNA damage inhibits the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction in vivo. A, cdc16 mutant strains expressing Cdc20-Myc and HA-tagged Pds1 (ZH2601-1D) or untagged Pds1 (ZH2601-3C) were grown at 23 °C, arrested in G1 with α-factor and either irradiated (γ radiation, 8 krad) or left untreated. Cells were then released from the G1 arrest at 37 °C to inactivate the cdc16 gene product. Cell extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. Pds1-HA and Cdc20-Myc were detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. Lanes 1-4, total extracts; lanes 5-8, the products of the immunoprecipitation reactions. B-D, same immunoprecipitation procedure as described in A, except that mec1, chk1, or rad53 mutant strains, respectively, were used. E, quantification of the relative Cdc20 levels that co-immunoprecipitated with Pds1 in the absence and presence of DNA damage. The relative levels of precipitating Cdc20-Myc were quantified by densitometry scan of several independent experiments for each strain, calculating the relative amounts of Cdc20-Myc the coimmunoprecipitated with Pds1-HA. These values were normalized to the total amount of Cdc20-Myc present in the starting extracts (left panels), and the results are shown as the percent of co-immunoprecipitating Cdc20-Myc in the presence of DNA damage out of the amount of Cdc20 that co-precipitated with Pds1-HA in the same strain but in the absence of DNA damage (e.g. a 25% value indicates that the amount of Cdc20-Myc that co-immunoprecipitated with Pds1-HA in the presence of DNA damage is 4-fold lower than the amount of Cdc20-Myc that co-immunoprecipitated with Pds1-HA in the same strain, but in the absence of DNA damage).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To confirm that the DNA damage-dependent inhibition of the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction was mediated by the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiment using cells that were defective in the checkpoint response due to a mec1 mutation. In this strain, in the presence of DNA damage Pds1 is neither phosphorylated nor stabilized (7Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In mec1 mutant cells the presence of DNA damage did not block the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 2E). The difference in the fraction of Cdc20 that co-immunoprecipitated with Pds1-HA in irradiated wild-type versus irradiated mec1 strains (21.8 ± 8.8% and 80.5 ± 12% of the amount that co-precipitated in non-irradiated cells, respectively) was statistically significant, as determined by unpaired Student's t test (p = 0.0307) (Fig. 2E). Thus we conclude that the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction is subjected to regulation by the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.Since Pds1 undergoes Chk1-dependent phosphorylation, we next examined whether the inability of Pds1 and Cdc20 to interact in the presence of DNA damage was due to Pds1 phosphorylation by Chk1. To address this question, the immunoprecipitation experiments were done with extracts from irradiated and non-irradiated cells lacking Chk1 function. As seen in Figs. 2C (lanes 5 and 6) and 2E, the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction was still blocked in a chk1Δ mutant. The difference in the amounts of Cdc20 co-precipitating with Pds1-HA in DNA damaged wild-type versus chk1Δ cells (21.8 ± 8.8% and 6.5 ± 8.6% of the amount that co-precipitated in non-irradiated cells, respectively) was insignificant (p = 0.2207). This suggested that a DNA damage checkpoint function other than Chk1-mediated phosphorylation is regulating the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction.Given that Rad53 is also responsible for the stabilization of Pds1, we examined the Cdc20-Pds1 interaction in cells defective for Rad53 checkpoint function. In this strain Pds1 is still phosphorylated by Chk1 in response to DNA damage (7Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14361-14366Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 9Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the in the absence of Rad53 checkpoint function, the presence of DNA damage no longer abolished the Cdc20-Pds1 interaction (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6, and Fig. 2E). We find that the difference in the amounts of Cdc20 co-precipitating with Pds1-HA in DNA damaged wild-type versus rad53 mutant cells (84 ± 12.7% of the amount that co-precipitated in nonirradiated rad53 mutant cells) was significant (p = 0.0295), whereas the amounts of Cdc20 associated with Pds1 in DNA-damaged mec1 and rad53 mutant strains were not significantly different (p = 0.8036). Thus, it is the Rad53 branch of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway that stabilizes Pds1 by inhibiting its interaction with Cdc20.Chk1 Phosphorylation Is Sufficient to Inhibit the Ubiquitination of Pds1 by APC/CCdc20—Our results suggest that multiple inputs regulate the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction: Rad53 controls the Pds1-Cdc20 interaction whereas Chk1 phosphorylation must affect the stability of Pds1 through a different mechanism. To examine the effect of Chk1 phosphorylation per se, we tested whether Pds1 phosphorylated by Chk1 can undergo APC/CCdc20-dependent ubiquitination. We imagine that in vivo, one of two possible scenarios may take place. 1) Phosphorylated Pds1 may be a poor substrate for APC/CCdc20. 2) Phosphorylated Pds1 is a fine APC/CCdc20 substrate but in vivo phosphorylated Pds1 associates with another protein(s) that either blocks its accessibility to APC/CCdc20 or stimulates a deubiquitination reaction. The difference between the two scenarios is that in the former phosphorylation is sufficient to stabilize Pds1 whereas in the latter phosphorylation is not sufficient, and stabilization is achieved through the interaction of phosphorylated Pds1 with another protein(s). To test whether Chk1 phosphorylation is sufficient to block Pds1 ubiquitination we utilized an in vitro APC/C ubiquitination system that included purified Xenopus APC/C (28King R.W. Peters J.-M. Tugendreich S. Rolfe M. Hieter P. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1995; 81: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) with either recombinant Cdc20 or recombinant Cdh1. As substrate we used recombinant Pds1, with and without Chk1 phosphorylation. Although in vivo Pds1 is only subjected to ubiquitination by APC/CCdc20, in the in vitro reaction recombinant Pds1 was ubiquitinated by either APC/CCdc20 or APC/CCdh1 (Fig. 3A), probably because under these conditions Cdh1 is not subjected to the same inhibitory phosphorylation that it experiences in vivo (see below). To test whether Chk1 phosphorylation was sufficient to block the ubiquitination of Pds1, Pds1 was phosphorylated in vitro by immuno-purified Chk1 and subjected to ubiquitination by either APC/CCdc20 or APC/CCdh1. To follow the fate of the Pds1 that underwent phosphorylation by Chk1, the phosphorylation reaction included [32P]ATP, thus allowing us to specifically detect phosphorylated Pds1 by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3, panels B-D, phosphorylation of Pds1 by Chk1 substantially reduced the ubiquitination of Pds1 by APC/CCdc20. The difference in ubiquitination of Pds1 with and without Chk1 phosphorylation was statistically significant, as determined by the unpaired t test (p = 0.0018 for the 30 min time point and p = 0.0149 for the 60 min time point). In contrast, Chk1-phosphorylated Pds1 was ubiquitinated by APC/CCdh1 as efficiently as unphosphorylated Pds1 (Fig. 3, panels B-D, the d"
https://openalex.org/W2025257231,"The putative virulence factors of Vibrio vulnificus include an elastase, the gene product of vvpE. We previously demonstrated that vvpE expression is differentially directed by two different promoters in a growth phase-dependent manner. The activity of the stationaryphase promoter (promoter S (PS)) is dependent on RpoS and is also under the positive control of cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP). In this study, primer extension analyses revealed that SmcR, the Vibrio harveyi LuxR homolog, is also involved in the regulation of vvpE transcription by activating PS. Although the influence of CRP on PS is mediated by SmcR, the level of PS activity observed when CRP and SmcR function together was found to be greater than the sum of the PS activities achieved by each activator alone. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the cellular levels of RpoS, CRP, and SmcR were not significantly affected by one other, indicating that CRP and SmcR function cooperatively to activate PS rather than sequentially in a regulatory cascade. The binding sites for CRP and SmcR were mapped based on a deletion analysis of the vvpE promoter region and confirmed by in vitro DNase I protection assays. The binding sites for CRP and SmcR were juxtapositioned and centered 220 and 198 bp upstream of the transcription start site of PS, respectively. Accordingly, these results reveal that CRP and SmcR function synergistically to coactivate the expression of vvpE by the RpoS-dependent promoter (PS) and that the activators exert their effect by directly binding to the promoter in the stationary phase.

The pathogenic marine bacterium Vibrio vulnificus is the causative agent of food-borne diseases, including life-threatening septicemia and possibly gastroenteritis, in individuals with underlying predisposed conditions such as liver damage, excess levels of iron, and immunocompromised conditions. Wound infections also result from exposure to seawater or from the handling of shellfish contaminated with V. vulnificus. The mortality from septicemia is very high (>50%), and death can occur within 1–2 days after the first signs of illness. Several potential virulence factors, including an endotoxin, polysaccharide capsule, iron-sequestering systems, cytolytic hemolysin, elastase, phospholipase A2, and other exotoxins, have been identified in V. vulnificus (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Linkous D.A. Oliver J.D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 174: 207-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Strom M.S. Paranjpye R.N. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The elastase activity is from a neutral metalloprotease and represents the major proteolytic activity of V. vulnificus (3Kothary M.H. Kreger A.S. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 1783-1791PubMed Google Scholar, 4Oliver J.D. Wear J.E. Thomas M.B. Warner M. Linder K. Diagn. Microbiol. Infect. Dis. 1986; 5: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Our previous study revealed the existence of at least two proteases that are produced by V. vulnificus (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, vvpE was designed to differentiate the elastase gene from other genes encoding other potential proteases of V. vulnificus (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As such, a gene encoding the V. vulnificus elastase was recently cloned and sequenced by us (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and by others (6Cheng J.C. Shao C.P. Hor L.I. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 183: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The deduced gene product was predicted to be a 609-amino acid polypeptide, and the mature elastase is a 45-kDa protein consisting of 413 amino acids generated by the deletion of the N-terminal 196 amino acids. Using the mature protease purified from recombinant Escherichia coli, two functional domains, a 35-kDa N-terminal domain required for catalytic activity and 10-kDa domain required for attachment to substrate, were identified (7Miyoshi S. Wakae H. Tomochika K. Shinoda S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7606-7609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristics of elastase as a potential virulence factor have primarily been studied using the purified protein in animal models (reviewed in Ref. 8Miyoshi S. Shinoda S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The injection of purified elastase can reproduce many aspects of the diseases caused by V. vulnificus, including dermonecrosis, tissue destruction, edema, and ulceration. These diverse activities are believed to be caused by the proteolytic degradation or inactivation of biologically important host proteins and immune system components such as collagen, fibrin, and complement. Conversely, increased vascular permeability is stimulated by the direct activation of the Hageman factor and prekallikrein by elastase, leading to the production of bradykinin. In addition, the activity of elastase toward host iron-binding proteins is involved in the utilization of heme and iron. Compared with the substantial number of reports on the characterization of purified elastase, there have been only a few studies on the regulatory mechanism used by the bacterium to modulate the expression of the vvpE gene (9Jeong H.S.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we showed that transcription of the vvpE gene of V. vulnificus is initiated by two different types of promoter, promoter L (PL) 1The abbreviations used are: PL, promoter L; PS, promoter S; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; RNAP, RNA polymerase; α-CTD, α-subunit C-terminal domain; IHF, integration host factor.1The abbreviations used are: PL, promoter L; PS, promoter S; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; RNAP, RNA polymerase; α-CTD, α-subunit C-terminal domain; IHF, integration host factor. and promoter S (PS), in a growth phase-dependent manner (9Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13875-13880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The basal level expression of vvpE is directed by PL, independent of RpoS and cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), and remains low throughout the log and stationary growth phases. In addition to this basal level, more vvpE expression is induced by PS in the stationary phase, which is under the positive control of both CRP and RpoS. This differential utilization of two promoters can permit precise levels of elastase in response to modifications of the environment and growth stage. Meanwhile, it has been reported that SmcR, the Vibrio harveyi LuxR homolog, is also involved in the positive control of vvpE expression (10Shao C.P. Hor L.I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, until now, no molecular analysis of the role of CRP and SmcR in vvpE expression has been reported. Neither the promoter(s) of the vvpE gene activated by SmcR nor the sequences upstream of vvpE required for activation by CRP and SmcR have been previously identified. Furthermore, the question of whether the activators directly or indirectly affect vvpE expression has not yet been addressed. Accordingly, in an effort to elucidate the regulatory mechanism of vvpE expression at a molecular level, this study examined the influence of the mutation of smcR on the activity of vvpE promoters. The relationship between RpoS, CRP, and SmcR was also examined by determining the cellular level of the proteins in an rpoS, crp, and smcR background. As a result, it was demonstrated that CRP and SmcR coactivate PS of vvpE in a synergistic and seemingly growth phase-dependent manner. Finally, the binding of CRP and SmcR directly to the upstream portion of vvpE was demonstrated, and the binding sites for CRP and SmcR were determined. Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Media—The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I. The E. coli strains used for plasmid DNA replication or conjugational transfer of plasmids were grown in LB broth with or without 1.5% (w/v) agar. Unless noted otherwise, the V. vulnificus strains were grown in LB medium supplemented with 2.0% (w/v) NaCl (LBS).

Open table in a new tab Measurement of Cell Growth and Elastase Activities—Cultures of the V. vulnificus strains were grown at 30 °C under aeration, and growth was monitored by measuring the A 600 of the cultures. Cultures incubated for 12–16 h (A 600 = 2.0) were harvested, and the elastase activities in the stationary phase were determined according to previously described procedures (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The means ± S.E. were calculated from at least three independent experiments. General Genetic Methods—Isolation of the plasmid DNA and genomic DNA and transformations were carried out according to the procedures described by Sambrook and Russell (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The restriction and DNA-modifying enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) were used as recommended by the manufacturer. The DNA fragments were purified from agarose gels using a Geneclean II kit (Bio 101, Inc., Vista, CA). The primary DNA cloning and manipulation were conducted in E. coli DH5α, and restriction mapping was used to confirm that the transformants contained the appropriate plasmids. PCR amplification of the DNA was performed using a GeneAmp PCR 2400 system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and standard protocols. Generation of smcR::nptI Mutants—A 1.2-kb DNA fragment from V. vulnificus (ATCC29307) that carried the entire smcR coding region was cloned into pHS103 2S. H. Choi, manuscript in preparation. (Table I). To inactivate smcR in vitro, a 1.2-kb nptI DNA conferring resistance to kanamycin (12Oka A. Sugisaki H. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) was inserted into a unique ClaI site present within the coding region of smcR. The 2.4-kb smcR::nptI cartridge was then liberated from the resulting construct (pHS1031) and ligated with SmaI-digested pCVD442 (13Donnenberg M.S. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 4310-4317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form pHS1032 (Table I). To generate the smcR::nptI mutant by homologous recombination, E. coli SM10 λpir, tra (containing pHS1032) (14Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) was used as a conjugal donor to V. vulnificus ATCC29307 (see Fig. 1A). For construction of the smcR rpoS or smcR crp double mutant, isogenic mutants of ATCC29307, which lack either rpoS (KP101) 3K.-H. Lee, manuscript in preparation. or crp (DI0201), 2S. H. Choi, manuscript in preparation. were used as the recipients. The conjugation and isolation of the transconjugants were conducted using previously described methods (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H.

Overexpression and Purification of V. vulnificus SmcR, CRP, and RpoS—The coding region of smcR was amplified using the chromosomal DNA of V. vulnificus ATCC29307 as the template and oligonucleotide primers His-SmcR001 and His-SmcR002 (see Table II). The 0.6-kb PCR product was subcloned into a His6 tagging expression vector, pRSET C (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid, pHS104, encoded SmcR with a His6 tag at the amino terminus. The His-tagged SmcR protein was then expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), and the protein was purified by affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's procedure (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). In a similar way, the expression and purification of His-tagged CRP and His-tagged RpoS were carried out using pHK0201 and pKP001,3 carrying the V. vulnificus crp and rpoS genes, respectively, as described (16Choi H.K.

Open table in a new tab Western Blot Analysis of V. vulnificus SmcR, CRP, and RpoS Proteins—The purified His-tagged proteins were used to raise primary antibodies against SmcR, CRP, and RpoS of V. vulnificus. Polyclonal antibodies specific to each protein were made by immunizing Sprague-Dawley rats on three occasions at 3-week intervals with 200 μg of the protein for each immunization. Western immunoblotting was performed according to the procedure described previously by Jeong et al. (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cellular proteins of the wild type and its isogenic mutants grown to the log and stationary phases were resolved by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with a 1:5000 dilution of the rat polyclonal antibodies. The bound antibodies were detected using goat anti-rat IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and visualized by incubation with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (Sigma) (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transcript Analysis—Total cellular RNA was isolated from the V. vulnificus strains at different growth phases using a TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. For the primer extension experiments, an end-labeled 24-base primer (VVPE9905) complementary to a coding region of vvpE was added to the RNA and then extended with SuperScript II RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described previously (9Jeong H.S.

The cDNA products were then purified and resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders generated with the same primer used for the primer extension. The nucleotide sequence for the plasmid DNA of pKC980 (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect.

For Northern slot blot analysis, a series of reactions was performed according to standard procedures (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) with 20 μg of total RNA. A 1.2-kb HindIII-HindIII DNA probe representing the internal sequences of vvpE was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Prime-a-gene labeling system (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for hybridization as described previously (9Jeong H.S.

The primer extension products and Northern hybridization blots were visualized using a phosphorimage analyzer (Model BAS1500, Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Construction of a Set of vvpE-luxAB Transcriptional Fusions—A set of vvpE-luxAB transcriptional fusion reporters was created by subcloning a series of DNA fragments that overlapped the vvpE promoter region into pHK0011 (see Fig. 6A) that was carrying promoterless luxAB luciferase genes (9Jeong H.S.

The subcloned fragments were amplified by PCR using pKC980 (5Jeong K.C. Jeong H.S. Rhee J.H. Lee S.E. Chung S.S. Starks A.M. Escudero G.M. Gulig P.A. Choi S.H. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 5096-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) as the template. Primer VVPE006 (see Table II) included an XbaI restriction site followed by bases corresponding to the 5′-end of the vvpE coding region. VVPE006 was used in conjunction with one of the following primers to amplify the DNA upstream of vvpE: VVPE001 (for pHS201), VVPE002 (for pHS202), VVPE003 (for pHS203), VVPE004 (for pHS204), or VVPE005 (for pHS205) (see Table II). A KpnI restriction site was added to these primers to facilitate the cloning of the PCR products. The DNA fragments were digested with XbaI and KpnI and inserted into pHK0011 that had been digested with the same enzymes, thereby creating five vvpE-luxAB reporter constructs, as confirmed by DNA sequencing. The vvpE-luxAB reporters were then transferred into ATCC29307 and the isogenic mutants by conjugation. The cellular luminescence of the cultures was measured with a luminometer (Lumat Model 9501, Berthold, Wildbad, Germany) and expressed in arbitrary relative light units as described previously (9Jeong H.S.

Gel Mobility Shift Assay and DNase I Footprinting—The gel shift assays were performed according to standard procedures (11Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The 200-bp upstream region of vvpE, extending from residues –300 to –101 with respect to the +1 transcription start site, was amplified by PCR using 32P-labeled VVPE021 and unlabeled VVPE022 as the primers. The binding of CRP to the labeled DNA and electrophoretic analysis of the CRP·DNA complexes have already been described (16Choi H.K. Park N.Y. Kim D.I. Chung H.J. Ryu S. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47292-47299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein-DNA binding reactions with SmcR were the same as those with CRP, except that cAMP was omitted from the reaction buffer. For competition analyses, the same but unlabeled 200-bp DNA fragment was used as a competitor DNA. For the DNase I protection assays, a 270-bp fragment of the vvpE promoter region was generated by PCR amplification using a combination of 32P-labeled and unlabeled primers VVPE023 and VVPE024. The binding of CRP to the labeled DNA and DNase I digestion of the CRP·DNA complexes was carried out following the procedures described previously by Choi et al. (16Choi H.K. Park N.Y. Kim D.I. Chung H.J. Ryu S. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47292-47299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After precipitation with ethanol, the digested DNA products were resolved on a sequencing gel alongside sequencing ladders of pKC980 generated using either VVPE023 (for the coding strand) or VVPE024 (for the noncoding strand) as the primer. Similar experimental conditions were used with SmcR, except that cAMP was omitted from the reaction buffer for the SmcR·DNA complex formation. The gels were visualized as described for the primer extension analyses. Construction and Confirmation of V. vulnificus smcR, smcR crp, and smcR rpoS Mutants—Previously, it has been suggested that SmcR positively regulates vvpE gene expression in V. vulnificus (10Shao C.P. Hor L.I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1369-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, to further examine the regulation of vvpE by SmcR, V. vulnificus smcR mutants were constructed by allelic exchange (Fig. 1A). A double crossover in which each wild-type smcR gene was replaced with an smcR::nptI allele was confirmed by PCR as shown in Fig. 1B. The PCR analysis of the genomic DNA from ATCC29307, KP101, and DI0201 using primers SmcR001 and SmcR002 (Table II) produced a 0.6-kb fragment (Fig. 1B); meanwhile, the genomic DNA from the smcR::nptI mutants resulted in an amplified DNA fragment ∼1.8 kb in length. The 1.8-kb fragment was in agreement with the projected size of a DNA fragment containing the wild-type smcR (0.6 kb) and nptI (1.2 kb) genes. The mutants chosen for further analysis were named HS03 for the smcR mutant, HS04 for the smcR rpoS double mutant, and DI0202 for the smcR crp double mutant (Fig. 1B and Table I). To determine the stability of the insertional mutation, the mutant strains were grown overnight without kanamycin selection. The inserted nptI DNA was stably maintained as determined by the sustained kanamycin resistance (all of >500 colonies tested) and generation of the appropriately sized DNA fragment by PCR (data not shown). Effect of smcR Mutation on Production of Elastase—When the smcR mutant HS03 was compared with its parental wild type during stationary growth, it produced much less elastase, and the level of elastase activity was almost 10-fold less than in the wild type (Fig. 2). The vvpE transcript was not apparent in the smcR mutant, indicating that the effect of SmcR on the expression of elastase is at the level of transcription. We examined whether the reintroduction of recombinant smcR could complement the decrease in elastase activity in HS03. For this purpose, plasmid pHS105 was constructed by subcloning the smcR coding region, which was amplified by PCR using primers SmcR003 and SmcR004 (Table II), into pRK415 under the control of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter (18Keen N.T. Tamaki S. Kobayashi D. Trollinger D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 70: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). When smcR was induced by IPTG, the elastase activity and vvpE transcript of HS03 (pHS105) in the stationary phase were restored to levels comparable to those in the wild type (Fig. 2). Therefore, the decreased elastase activity of HS03 apparently resulted from the inactivation of functional smcR rather than any polar effects on genes downstream of smcR. The elastase activity in the smcR rpoS double mutant HS04 was present at ∼2 units (Fig. 2), which was much lower than that reached by the wild type, yet indistinguishable from that in the rpoS single mutant KP101 (Fig. 2). The expression of vvpE remained low unless the functional gene product of rpoS was provided and was completely unaffected by the additional inactivation of smcR. Furthermore, it was noted that the repressed level of elastase in HS04 was not restored at all by the reintroduction of either SmcR (pHS105) or RpoS (pHS0001) (Fig. 2), indicating that SmcR is capable of activating the expression of vvpE only when RpoS is present and that SmcR exerts its effects on vvpE expression through a promoter whose activity depends on RpoS. Effect of SmcR on vvpE Expression Is Mediated through the RpoS-dependent Promoter—A previous study suggested that the expression of vvpE is directed by two different types of promoters, PL and PS, in a growth phase-dependent manner (9Jeong H.S. Jeong K.C. Choi H.K. Park K.J. Lee K.-H. Rhee J.H. Choi S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13"
https://openalex.org/W2159118517,"CDX2 is a caudal-related homeobox transcription factor whose expression in the adult is normally restricted to intestinal epithelium. Mice heterozygous for germ line Cdx2 inactivation develop intestinal polyps, and the lesions lack Cdx2 expression. Prior studies indicate some human colon carcinomas also lack CDX2 expression. To address the role of CDX2 defects in colon cancer development, we analyzed CDX2 expression in 45 primary colorectal carcinomas. Four carcinomas lacked CDX2 expression, and three others showed aberrant cytoplasmic localization of CDX2, although no significant CDX2 gene defects were seen in the seven tumors. Marked reductions in CDX2 transcript and protein levels were seen in five of 13 colorectal cell lines, and nuclear run-off data indicated reduced transcription was a major factor in CDX2 silencing. Treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine and/or the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A did not restore CDX2 expression in CDX2-negative lines. However, consistent with a role for dominant repression mechanisms in CDX2 silencing, all somatic cell hybrids resulting from pairwise fusions between colon cancer lines with intact CDX2 expression and lines lacking CDX2 had reduced CDX2 transcripts and protein. A roughly 9.5-kb 5′-flanking region from the human CDX2 gene contained key cis elements for regulating transcription in colon cancer cells. Restoration of CDX2 expression suppressed proliferation and soft agar growth in the CDX2-negative HT-29 colon cancer cell line. Our findings suggest CDX2 inactivation in colon cancer results from defects in trans-acting pathways regulating CDX2 transcription, and CDX2 silencing contributes to the altered phenotype of some colorectal cancers.

Our findings suggest CDX2 inactivation in colon cancer results from defects in trans-acting pathways regulating CDX2 transcription, and CDX2 silencing contributes to the altered phenotype of some colorectal cancers. Considerable progress has been made in defining some of the critical mutations and gene expression changes in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), p53, and K-RAS genes appear to play prominent roles in the process, and defects in other oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes contribute in a more variable fashion to colorectal cancer development and progression (1Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill Companies Inc., New York2002: 583-612Google Scholar). Besides the well established role of mutational mechanisms in tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer, a growing body of evidence indicates that epigenetic mechanisms may play a prominent role in tumor suppressor gene inactivation in cancer in general and colorectal cancer specifically (2Jones P.A. Baylin S.B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 415-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These epigenetic mechanisms include hypermethylation at CpG dinucleotide sites in or nearby key cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements as well as post-translational modifications (e.g. acetylation and methylation) of histones and perhaps other transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins. The discovery of specific germ line (constitutional) mutations that predispose to tumor development in man and/or the mouse offers the possibility of highlighting and clarifying genes and mechanisms involved in sporadic tumor development. Of some interest for the colorectal cancer field has been the observation that the majority of mice heterozygous for germ line inactivation of the Cdx2 gene (Cdx2+/–) develop from one to 10 polyps in their proximal colon and distal small intestine within the first 3 months of life (3Chawengsaksophak K. James R. Hammond V.E. Kontgen F. Beck F. Nature. 1997; 386: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 4Tamai Y. Nakajima R. Ishikawa T. Takaku K. Seldin M.F. Taketo M.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2965-2970PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a possible tumor suppressor function for Cdx2, the epithelial cells in the polyps lose CDX2 protein expression. However, the mechanisms accounting for somatic inactivation of the remaining Cdx2 allele in the tumors arising in the Cdx2+/– mice remain obscure. Intriguingly the polyps in Cdx2+/– mice contain areas of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, similar to that seen in the forestomach and esophagus, as well as areas of epithelium resembling that seen in normal gastric mucosa (5Beck F. Chawengsaksophak K. Waring P. Playford R.J. Furness J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7318-7323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it would appear the CDX2 protein functions as a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in intestinal epithelial cells. The CDX2 protein is a homeobox transcription factor, and it derives its name from the Drosophila homeotic gene caudal (Cad). Cad plays an important role in segmentation and the formation of posterior structures in Drosophila such as the posterior midgut and hindgut (6Macdonald P.M. Struhl G. Nature. 1986; 324: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 7Mlodzik M. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1987; 48: 465-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A number of Cad-related genes have been identified in mammals, including at least two homologues in man termed CDX1 and CDX2. While CDX2 is rather broadly expressed in embryogenesis, in adult tissues of mouse and man, CDX2 expression appears to be essentially restricted to epithelial cells in the small intestine and colon (8James R.

Like CDX2, CDX1 expression is restricted to the intestinal epithelium in the adult (12Silberg D.G. Furth E.E. Taylor J.K. Schuck T. Chiou T. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 478-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although there are similarities, the pattern of CDX1 expression in embryos differs from that of CDX2 (11Silberg D.G. Swain G.P. Suh E.R. Traber P.G. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), and Cdx1–/– mice have a phenotype distinct from that of Cdx2–/– mice (3Chawengsaksophak K.

Moreover, unlike Cdx2+/– mice, Cdx1+/– mice have not been reported to manifest a predisposition to intestinal tumors. Loss of CDX1 and/or CDX2 gene and/or protein expression has been reported in a subset of primary colorectal cancers and cancer cell lines (10Ee H.C. Erler T. Bhathal P.S. Young G.P. James R.J. Am. J.

Our recent studies indicate CDX2 expression may be most commonly lost in poorly differentiated colorectal carcinomas that show minimal gland-forming ability (16Hinoi T. Tani M. Lucas P.C. Caca K.

In some prior studies, mutations in the CDX2 gene have not been found to account for loss of CDX2 expression (17Wicking C. Simms L.A. Evans T. Walsh M. Chawengsaksophak K. Beck F. Chenevix-Trench G.

In an effort to obtain further insights into the means by which the CDX2 protein plays a role in colorectal cancer, we have pursued studies to identify mechanisms responsible for CDX2 gene inactivation in colon cancer. Here we report on evidence that loss of CDX2 expression in primary colon carcinomas and colorectal cancer-derived cell lines may result from defects in trans-acting pathways regulating CDX2 transcription. We also provide evidence of a significant role for CDX2 inactivation in the tumorigenic phenotype of some colorectal cancers. Plasmids—To generate pBluescript II-KS (pBS) 1The abbreviations used are: pBS, pBluescript II-KS; 5-azaC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RIPA, radioimmunoprecipitation assay; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; PAC, P1-derived artificial chromosome; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; LI, liver-intestine; CDX2P, CDX2 promoter./CDX2 (2–164), a cDNA encoding CDX2 amino acids 2–164 with a BamHI site at the 5′-end and EcoRI site at the 3′-end was synthesized by PCR with forward primer 5′-CGGGATCCTACGTGAGCTACCTCCTGGACA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TGAATTCTAGTTCCGCCGCTGGCCGCCG-3′ using hexamer-primed cDNA from normal human colon tissue as template and then subcloned into pBS vector. A fragment of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA was generated by PCR with forward primer 5′-AAGGCTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTCCCGTCTAGCTCAGGGATGACCTTGCCC-3′ using hexamer-primed cDNA from Caco2 cells as template. The GAPDH PCR product was subcloned into pBS vector to generate pBS/GAPDH. A bacteriophage P1-derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) vector containing large human genomic DNA fragments (Genome System Inc., St. Louis, MO) was screened by PCR using primers derived from the CDX2 coding region (5′-AGAGCAAAGGAGAGGAAAATCAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCTCATGGCTCAGCCTGGAAT-3′ (reverse)), and a PAC clone containing a DNA insert of about 120 kb harboring the full-length CDX2 coding region and 5′- and 3′-flanking regions was identified. A 9.4-kb fragment with XhoI sites containing sequence from the 5′-flanking region of CDX2 was cloned and inserted into the pGL3 basic vector (pGL3) to generate pGL3/CDX2P9.5. The sequence of all inserts generated by PCR were verified by automated sequencing of the plasmid constructs. Tumor Specimens and Immunohistochemistry—Forty-five formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded primary colorectal carcinoma specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody against CDX2 essentially as described previously (16Hinoi T. Tani M. Lucas P.C. Caca K. Dunn R.L. Macri E. Loda M. Appelman H.D. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2239-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, after formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were deparaffinized and hydrated, antigen enhancement was performed by boiling slides in a microwave oven for 10 min in citrate buffer (Antigen Retrieval Citra Solution, Biogenex Laboratories, Inc., San Ramon, CA). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by 6% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. After washes with phosphate-buffered saline and incubation with blocking serum for 10 min, slides were incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C. Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody to CDX2 was used at 1:100 dilution. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, slides were incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min (Vectastain Elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase method using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as a chromogenic substrate (DAB substrate kit for peroxidase, Vector Laboratories, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. Sections were lightly counter-stained with hematoxylin and then evaluated by light microscopy. Genomic DNA from the neoplastic elements of the four carcinomas lacking CDX2 expression and the three with cytoplasmic CDX2 staining was obtained by microdissection of the elements and subsequent isolation of DNA as described previously (16Hinoi T. Tani M. Lucas P.C. Caca K. Dunn R.L. Macri E. Loda M. Appelman H.D. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 2239-2248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, five consecutive 5-μm formalin-fixed tissue sections were cut from each paraffin block, mounted on glass slides, and then weakly stained with hematoxylin. Neoplastic regions were carefully microdissected with 22-gauge needles under a microscope using adjacent hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections as dissection guides, and genomic DNA was then extracted from the dissected tissue. CDX2 Mutational Analysis—The sequences of exon-intron boundaries of CDX2 were confirmed by sequencing of the CDX2-containing PAC. Eight pairs of primers were used to amplify CDX2 genomic DNA for the mutational analysis. Five pairs were used to amply exon 1 sequences (1a–1e), one pair was used for exon 2, and two pairs were used for exon 3 (3a and 3b). The length of PCR products and the sequence of the primers used were as follows: exon 1a (200 bp, forward, 5′-CCCCCGGCAGCCTCCAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTGGTAACCGCCGTAGTCC-3′), exon 1b (168 bp, forward, 5′-TGGCGCCGCAGAACTTCGTCAGC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCGCGTAGCCATTCCAGTCCTC-3′), exon 1c (168 bp, forward, 5′-ATCCTGGCCGGCAGCGTATG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGTGGTGGTGCGGATGGTA-3′), exon 1d (172 bp, forward, 5′-GGCCGCAGCCATGGGCTAC-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGAGACAGCTGCTCGGCG-3′), exon 1e (174 bp, forward, 5′-TGCTGCAAACGCTCAACCCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCTTCCCAAGCACCCTCCGA-3′), exon 2 (235 bp, forward, 5′-CTGGGTTAGGGAGGTTTGTCATTA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GTCCCCACCTGCCTCTCA-3′), exon 3a (209 bp, forward, 5′-TTTCCCTCACATCTTCACCACCAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGGGCTCTGGGACACTTCTCA-3′), and exon 3b (199 bp, forward, 5′-CCCCAGCCTCAGCCAGGTCCTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGTCCACGCTCCTCATGGCTCAGC-3′). Cell Culture—All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) with the exception of the following: HT-29/PGS-CDX2 and HT-29/PGS-neo cell lines, which were generated previously (21Hinoi T. Lucas P.C. Kuick R. Hanash S. Cho K.R. Fearon E.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1565-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All cell lines, except RKO, MCF-7, and BT-549, were propagated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. RKO was grown in McCoy's5A medium, and MCF-7 was grown in minimum essential medium α (Invitrogen), both with 10% fetal bovine serum. BT-549 was grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.23 units/ml insulin from bovine pancreas (Sigma). HT-29/PGS-CDX2 and HT-29/PGS-neo were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml and maintained in 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Cell lines were maintained in appropriate medium and were treated with 1 or 2 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-azaC) (Sigma) for 5 days to induce DNA demethylation before harvest. Cell lines were also treated with 0.5 μm trichostatin A (TSA) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) for 24 h to inhibit histone deacetylases. Wortmannin and insulin from porcine pancreas were purchased from Sigma. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h prior to insulin stimulation and/or wortmannin treatment. For continuous inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, medium from wortmannin-treated cells and control cells (Me2SO-treated) was replaced every 2–6 h because of the instability of wortmannin in aqueous medium (22Kimura K. Hattori S. Kabuyama Y. Shizawa Y. Takayanagi J. Nakamura S. Toki S. Matsuda Y. Onodera K. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18961-18967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells with TriZol (Invitrogen). For each sample, 10 μg of total RNA was separated on 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Zeta-Probe GT membranes (Bio-Rad) by capillary action. Fragments for detecting CDX2 and GAPDH transcripts on Northern blots were generated by digesting pBS/CDX2 (2–164) with EcoRI and BamHI and pBS/GAPDH with EcoRI. The fragments were gel-purified and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with the Rediprime II random priming labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). After prehybridization, membranes were hybridized in a Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Signals were detected by exposure to BioMax-MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. Western Blot Analysis—Whole-cell extracts were prepared with RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing protease inhibitors (Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablet, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce), and RIPA lysates containing 50 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis in 8 –10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After semidry transfer of the proteins to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P transfer membrane, Millipore, Bedford, MA), blots were incubated with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and 10% nonfat dry milk to block nonspecific antibody binding. Affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibody against CDX2 was used at 1:1,000 dilutions. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Akt and phospho-Akt (Ser-473) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) were used at 1:1,000 dilution. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against MLH-1 (clone G168-728, BD Pharmingen) and β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma) were used at 1:250 and 1:5,000 dilutions, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Pierce) were used as secondary antibodies at 1:20,000 dilutions. Blots were subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate, Pierce) and exposed to X-Omat film (Kodak). Nuclear Run-off Assay—Nuclei were obtained, and nuclear run-off assays were performed by a modification of procedures described previously (23Greenberg M.E. Bender T.P. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.10.1-4.10.11Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 107 cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped and lysed in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) using a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle) until nuclei appeared free of membrane components by phase-contrast microscopy. Nuclei were harvested, resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 40% (v/v) glycerol), and stored at –80 °C. Two hundred microliters of 2× reaction buffer with nucleotide (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 1 mm CTP, and 1 mm GTP) and 10 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) were added to 200 μl of nuclear suspension. The nuclear run-off transcription was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min with shaking. The reaction was then terminated by adding 0.6 ml of HSB buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2) containing 40 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) at 30 °C for 5 min. Ten microliters of 20 mg/ml proteinase K and 200 μl of SDS/Tris buffer (0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 125 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 5% SDS) were added and incubated at 42 °C for 30 min. After the mixture was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), 3 ml of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, 60 mm sodium pyrophosphate mixture, 2 ml of sterilized water, and 10 μl of 10 mg/ml Escherichia coli tRNA carrier were added, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice. Then the trichloroacetic acid precipitate was filtered onto a 0.45-μm Millipore HA filter (Millipore), and the filter was washed three times with 10 ml of 5% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate mixture. The filter was transferred to a siliconized glass scintillation vial and incubated with 1.5 ml of DNase I buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2) containing 25 μg/ml RNase-free DNase I at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 45 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0 and 68 μl of 20% SDS, and RNA was eluted by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. After collecting the supernatant, a second elution of the RNA was performed by incubating the filter further with 1.5 ml of elution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 10 min. The eluted RNA fractions were combined, and 4.5 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K was added followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. Following extraction of the mixture with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), 0.75 ml of 1 m NaOH was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min on ice. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1.5 ml of 1 m HEPES. Then RNA was precipitated by adding 0.53 ml of 3 m sodium acetate, pH 5.2 and 14.5 ml of 100% ethanol and incubating for 30 min on dry ice. Precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min and resuspended in 2 ml of TES solution (10 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.2% SDS) containing 0.3 m NaCl. The 32P-labeled RNA solution was hybridized to DNA immobilized on strips of nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). Five micrograms of linearized and denatured DNA plasmids such as pBS vector without insert as a negative control, pBS vector containing human GAPDH cDNA as a positive control to normalize the hybridization signals, and pBS vector containing human CDX2 cDNA (codon 2–164) were spotted on the filter using a DNA slot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 36 h, and the filter was washed in 2× SSC (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 65 °C for 1 h twice, incubated with 2× SSC containing 10 μg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min, and then washed again in 2× SSC at 37 °C for 1 h. The filter was dried and exposed to BioMax-MS film for 5–7 days. The results were also quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Somatic Cell Fusion—Somatic cell hybrid lines generated by fusion between colorectal cancer lines with intact CDX2 transcription (CDX2+) and colorectal cancer lines lacking CDX2 transcription (CDX2–) were performed essentially as described previously (24Hajra K.M. Ji X. Fearon E.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7274-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, the G418-resistant DLD-1 line was generated by transfection of cells with G418 resistance vector pcDNA3/neo (Invitrogen) and selection in medium with 0.5 mg/ml G418. The hygromycin-resistant HT-29 and WiDr lines were obtained by transfection with the hygromycin resistance vector pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen) and selection in medium containing 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of cells (4 × 106cells) from each of two parental lines (i.e. DLD-1 resistant to G418 and either hygromycin-resistant HT-29 or hygromycin-resistant WiDr cells) were mixed, washed once with serum-free medium, and exposed, by stirring for 1 min, to a 1:1 solution of polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Applied Science) and serum-free medium, pH 7.8. One milliliter of serum-free medium prewarmed to 37 °C was added to the cell suspension over another minute. Then 8 ml of serum-free medium was added over the next 2 min with stirring. Finally 30 ml of serum-free medium was added, and the cell suspension was centrifuged and resuspended in growth medium with serum. Cells were seeded and grown for 24 h before adding selection medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 and 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin. Multiple independent clones resistant to both G418 and hygromycin were isolated and expanded into hybrid lines from the fusions: DLD-1 and HT-29, yielding DLD-HT lines, and DLD-1 and WiDr, yielding DLD-Wi lines. Analysis of Polymorphic Loci in Hybrid Lines—Genomic DNA was amplified with primers from the Genome Database: 5′-GTTGAGGCAAGAGAATCACT-3′ (D13S629 forward), 5′-GCACATTTACACCAGGGTG-3′ (D13S629 reverse), 5′-ACCTGTTGTATGGCAGCAGT-3′ (D13S-1493 forward), and 5′-GGTTGACTCTTTCCCCAACT-3′ (D13S1493 reverse). PCR was performed in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, a 100 nm concentration of forward and reverse primers, a 200 μm concentration of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate, 1.5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). DNA fragments for each polymorphic locus were amplified for 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s followed by a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were diluted 10-fold in denaturing buffer (95% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and denatured at 90 °C for 3 min. Two microliters of denatured sample were electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 6 m urea, 30% formamide, and 1× Tris borate/EDTA electrophoresis buffer, and the polymorphic bands were visualized by autoradiography. Reporter Gene Assays—At 48 h prior to transfection, cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes. The transfections were performed with 4 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science)/μg of transfected DNA when the cells were at 50–80% confluency. To determine the transcriptional activity of the 5′-flanking region of the CDX2 gene, 0.5 μg of each CDX2 reporter gene construct and 0.5 μg of control plasmid pCH110 were used per 35-mm dish. At 40 h after transfection, the cells were collected and resuspended in reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) and a luminometer (model TD-20E, Turner Corp., Mountain View, CA). β-Galactosidase activities were determined by standard methods as a control for transfection efficiency. Cell Proliferation Analysis—HT-29/PGS-CDX2 cells and HT-29/PGS-neo cells were plated in 35-mm dishes at 2 × 104 cells/dish. After 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 days, the cell number was determined using a hemocytometer. Two independent sets of experiments were carried out, each one performed with triplicate measurements of cell number at each of the respective days. Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay—The ability of parental and transfected HT-29 cells to form macroscopically visible colonies in soft agar was determined essentially as described previously (25Freshney R.I. Culture of Animal Cells: A Manual of Basic Technique. 3rd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1994: 166-169Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-ml underlayers of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.6% Noble agar (Difco, Detroit, MI) were prepared in a 35-mm dish. Three different cell dilutions with the concentration of 10 ×, 3 ×, and 1 × 103 cells/ml were prepared in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 0.3% Noble agar, and 1 ml of each dilution was pipetted on the underl"
https://openalex.org/W1998120891,"The cytokine transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) plays an important role in preventing tumor formation by blocking cell cycle progression. Accordingly, many cancers demonstrate mutations in TGF-β signaling components or enhanced expression of inhibitors of the TGF-β pathway such as Smad7. In this report we show that the oncoprotein HER2/Neu is able to collaborate with the ETS transcription factor ER81 to activate Smad7 transcription in breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancer cell lines. ER81 binds to two ETS sites within the Smad7 promoter, and mutation of one of these ETS sites greatly decreases Smad7 induction by HER2/Neu and ER81. Furthermore, we show that Smad7 activation involves the processing of signals from HER2/Neu to ER81 via the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Thus, we have uncovered a novel mechanism by which oncogenic HER2/Neu, in collaboration with ER81, can induce carcinogenesis through Smad7 up-regulation. Moreover, we show that TAK1, a TGF-β-activated protein kinase, stimulates ER81 via the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and thereby induces the Smad7 promoter. This suggests that attenuation of TGF-β signaling by activating Smad7 transcription may proceed not only through TGF-β receptor-regulated Smad proteins but also through an independent pathway involving ER81 and TAK1.

One of the most widely studied roles of TGF-β is its function as a tumor suppressor, specifically its ability to block cell cycle progression through the G1/S transition. This is accomplished by facilitating p15 INK4B and p21 WAF1/CIP1 transcription, which in turn inhibits retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (1Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y.

Nature. 1994; 371: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1885) Google Scholar). TGF-β is also believed to down-regulate proto-oncogenes such as myc, a promoter of cell cycling (3Pietenpol J.A. Holt J.T.

Thus, TGF-β growth surveillance is an important obstacle many cells must overcome to evolve into a malignancy and achieve unrestricted growth. TGF-β signaling is propagated through the TGF-β receptor, a heterodimer consisting of transmembrane receptor serine/threonine kinases (6Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3982) Google Scholar). When bound to ligand, the type II TGF-β receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor within the heteromeric complex, which in turn phosphorylates receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), a family of transcription factors that are then free to associate with the common mediator Smad4 and translocate to the cell nucleus. There, R-Smad·Smad4 complexes can bind to specific DNA consensus sequences called Smad binding elements and thereby effect changes in gene transcription (7Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P.

Over 15% of colon carcinomas display mutations in the type II TGF-β receptor. The incidence of type II receptor mutations climbs to 90% if only those colon cancers with microsatellite instability are examined (13Parsons R. Myeroff L.L. Liu B. Willson J.K. Markowitz S.D. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5548-5550PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, 25% of ovarian cancers have a mutation in the type II receptor and 33% in the type I receptor (14Lynch M.A. Nakashima R. Song H. DeGroff V.L. Wang D. Enomoto T. Weghorst C.M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4227-4232PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mutations in type I TGF-β receptor are less frequent in cancers of the lung, breast, and colon (15Kim S.J. Im Y.H. Markowitz S.D. Bang Y.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 16Chen T. Triplett J. Dehner B. Hurst B. Colligan B. Pemberton J. Graff J.R. Carter J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4679-4682PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations have also been observed within the Smad family. About 50% of pancreatic and 15% of colorectal cancers have a mutation in Smad4 (6Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3982) Google Scholar, 17Massague J. Blain S.W. Lo R.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 295-309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar), whereas Smad2 mutations are seen in less than 5% of lung and colon cancers (18Riggins G.J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Thiagalingam S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2578-2580PubMed Google Scholar). Smad7 has been shown to inhibit TGF-β signaling (19Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B.

Cell. 1997; 89: 1165-1173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar), and, accordingly, Smad7 expression inhibits downstream effectors of TGF-β, such as p21 WAF1/CIP1 , in a dose-dependent manner (22Pardali K. Kurisaki A. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Kardassis D. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29244-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Whereas Smad7 possesses the domain responsible for binding to the type I TGF-β receptor, it lacks both the DNA binding domain and the serine motif present in R-Smads that becomes phosphorylated by the TGF-β receptor (23Zimmerman C.M. Padgett R.W. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 249: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In this way Smad7 acts as a competitive antagonist at the type I receptor, preventing R-Smad signaling. Smad7 has also been shown to play a key role in TGF-β receptor degradation by interacting with Smurf1 and Smurf2, two E3 ubiquitin ligases with whom Smad7 translocates from the nucleus to the type I receptor at the cell membrane upon TGF-β stimulation (24Kavsak P.

Research into the mechanisms governing Smad7 transcription has revealed a negative feedback loop, because the Smad7 promoter harbors a Smad binding element that facilitates activation by R-Smad·Smad4 complexes (27Nagarajan R.P. Zhang J. Li W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33412-33418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 28von Gersdorff G. Susztak K. Rezvani F. Bitzer M. Liang D. Bottinger E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11320-11326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because Smad7 can inhibit the anti-proliferative TGF-β signaling, Smad7 overexpression may be an additional mechanism by which cells progress on their path to a transformed phenotype. Consistently, overexpression of Smad7 has been noted in pancreatic and colon cancers (29Kleeff J. Ishiwata T. Maruyama H. Friess H. Truong P. Buchler M.W. Falb D. Korc M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Boulay J.L. Mild G. Reuter J. Lagrange M. Terracciano L. Lowy A. Laffer U. Orth B. Metzger U. Stamm B. Martinoli S. Herrmann R. Rochlitz C. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001; 31: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A possible regulator of Smad7 transcription is AP-1 (31Uchida K. Suzuki H. Ohashi T. Nitta K. Yumura W. Nihei H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), a complex that consists of Fos and Jun proteins and appears to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (32Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar). Interestingly, TGF-β can transiently up-regulate mRNA levels of c-Jun (33Kim S.J. Angel P. Lafyatis R. Hattori K. Kim K.Y. Sporn M.B. Karin M. Roberts A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, different promoters of TGF-β-responsive genes contain AP-1 binding sites, and their mutation impairs the ability of TGF-β to activate these promoters (8Yingling J.M. Datto M.B. Wong C. Frederick J.P. Liberati N.T. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Frederick J.P. Datto M.B. Liberati N.T. Li J.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1821-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), which may be due to the fact that AP-1 components interact with R-Smad·Smad4 complexes (34Liberati N.T. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Shen X. Wong C. Rougier-Chapman E.M. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4844-4849Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that TGF-β-activated Smad proteins may synergize with the AP-1 complex for activating TGF-β-responsive genes, including Smad7 (12Brodin G. Ahgren A. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. Heuchel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29023-29030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). R-Smad and Smad4 proteins are the primary mediators of the TGF-β pathway. However, other signaling pathways may be involved in TGF-β responses. TAK1 is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase family whose protein kinase activity is stimulated in response to TGF-β and may therefore activate TGF-β-responsive genes independently of Smad proteins (36Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 37Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 38Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Importantly, TAK1 stimulation leads to the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and inhibition of cell proliferation (39Terada Y. Nakashima O. Inoshita S. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1378-1390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, TAK1 may be responsible, in part, for the anti-proliferative effects of TGF-β. Another important activator of MAPK pathways is HER2/Neu, a transmembrane receptor kinase overexpressed in 20–30% of breast and ovarian cancers and 10–15% of endometrial cancers (40Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 41Hetzel D.J. Wilson T.O. Keeney G.L. Roche P.C. Cha S.S. Podratz K.C. Gynecol. Oncol. 1992; 47: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Clinically, HER2/Neu overexpression in tumors is associated with high grade, advanced stage, and poor prognosis. One downstream target of HER2/Neu is the ETS transcription factor ER81 (42Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 43Goel A. Janknecht R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6243-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which has a highly conserved ETS DNA binding domain (44Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, ER81 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells (45de Launoit Y. Chotteau-Lelievre A. Beaudoin C. Coutte L. Netzer S. Brenner C. Huvent I. Baert J.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 480: 107-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may collaborate with HER2/Neu in breast cancer formation. Here, we show that HER2/Neu and ER81 synergistically activate the human Smad7 promoter. Thus, we have identified how the oncoprotein HER2/Neu can antagonize the action of the tumor suppressor TGF-β through Smad7 up-regulation. This may further our understanding of carcinogenesis and explain one way in which HER2/Neu and/or ER81 overexpression favors cancer formation. Moreover, ER81 and TAK1 are shown to be part of an alternative negative feedback loop of the TGF-β pathway involving Smad7 up-regulation. Luciferase Promoter Constructs—A segment of the human Smad7 promoter (–3100 to +1502) was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene within the pGL2-Basic plasmid (Promega). Truncations of this luciferase promoter construct were generated using restriction endonucleases. Furthermore, two putative ETS consensus sequences (+50 to +53 and +55 to +58) within the 7xp promoter construct were mutated from GGAA to CCAA or from ATCC to ATGG, respectively, utilizing PCR. Similarly, two potential AP-1 binding sites (+180 to +183 and +188 to +191) were mutated from TGAG to TTAG. The integrity of all these mutant constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfections—RK13 cells were grown in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). OVCAR3, MCF7, HEC-1A, and 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were transiently transfected in 60-mm culture dishes using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method. The following amounts of DNA were utilized for reporter gene assays: 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid; 0.5 μg of ER81 (or 0.1 μg in case of OVCAR3 cells), ER81–6xA or ER81-(333–477) (42Bosc D.G.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); 3 μg (RK13 and OVCAR3 cells), 1 μg (HEC-1A cells), or 0.5 μg (MCF7 cells) of HER2/Neu-V664E (47Ben-Levy R. Paterson H.F.

Biol. 1996; 3: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar); 0.1 μg of MEK6-DD (50Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); 50 ng of p38–2 (50Stein B. Yang M.X. Young D.B. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Murray B.W. Barbosa M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19509-19517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); 1 μg of HA-TAK1 or HA-TAK1-K63W (37Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Inhibitors were added at 24 and 12 h prior to harvest in final concentrations of 5 μm (AG825 or SB202190), 10 μm (U0126), 20 μm (SP600125), or 30 μm (LY294002). Extracts were then prepared and assayed for luciferase activity as described previously (51Bredemeier-Ernst I. Nordheim A. Janknecht R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mean and standard deviation values were derived from three experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Respective sense and antisense oligonucleotides (2 μg of each) were mixed in a 100-μl total volume containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl, heated to 100 °C, and allowed to cool over the course of several hours. These hybridized primers were labeled by filling in overhanging ends with Klenow enzyme in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The sequences of the utilized oligonucleotides were as follows: ETS1-sense: CACTGCGCAGTGGAACCAGCCGAGC; ETS1-antisense: CTCTGCTCGGCTGGTTCCACTGCGCAGTG; ETS2/3-sense: GCTGCTCGGCGCACGGAAGATCCTGTCCCCG; ETS2/3-antisense: GCTCGGGGACAGGATCTTCCGTGCGCCGAGC; ETSm2/3-sense: GCTGCTCGGCGCACCCAAGATCCTGTCCCCG; ETSm2/3-antisense: GCTCGGGGACAGGATCTTGGGTGCGCCGAGC; ETS2/m3-sense: GCTGCTCGGCGCACGGAAGATGGTGTCCCCG; ETS2/m3-antisense: GCTCGGGGACACCATCTTCCGTGCGCCGAGC; ETSm2/m3-sense: GCTGCTCGGCGCACCCAAGATGGTGTCCCCG; ETSm2/m3-antisense: GCTCGGGGACACCATCTTGGGTGCGCCGAGC; modE74-sense: GCTGCTCGGCGCATACCGGAAGTTGTCCCCG; modE74-antisense: GCTCGGGGACAACTTCCGGTATGCGCCGAGC. Protein lysates were obtained from 293T cells transiently transfected with 1 μg of ER81 and/or 1 μg of HER2/Neu-V664E. 36 h after transfection cells were suspended in 600 μl of 40 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, and centrifuged (960 × g, 2 min, 23 °C). Cell pellets were then resuspended on ice in 100 μl of 10 mm Tris, 30 mm Na4P2O7 (pH 7.1), 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation for 1 h on ice, the debris was removed by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. Bacterially expressed ER81 (249–477) was generated and purified using the “IMPACT-CN System” (New England Biolabs) as described before (42Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled probes plus 0.25 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (sonicated to an average length of ∼500 bp) were suspended in 10 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 25 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. Samples were incubated on ice with 1 μg of protein lysate or 0.1 μg of recombinant ER81 (249–477) in the presence or absence of anti-ER81 antibody (anti-ETV1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The mixture was then separated by non-denaturing 4.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE is 89 mm, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C, after which the gel was dried and autoradiography performed. HER2/Neu and ER81 Synergistically Activate the Smad7 Promoter—To investigate whether HER2/Neu activates the human Smad7 promoter in conjunction with its downstream effector, the ETS transcription factor ER81 (42Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we cloned nucleotides –3100 to +1502 of the human Smad7 promoter upstream of the luciferase gene into the pGL2-Basic vector and used the resultant reporter plasmid to transiently transfect RK13 cells. Although additional transfection with HER2/Neu alone or ER81 alone resulted in only 2-fold activation of this reporter construct, there was a 10-fold induction of promoter activity in the presence of both HER2/Neu and ER81 (Fig. 1, A and B, see “7c”). To determine the minimal promoter region responsible for HER2/Neu- and ER81-mediated activation, truncated promoter constructs were generated (Fig. 1A). Five progressive 5′ and 3′ truncations of the full promoter construct had little effect on the activation of the Smad7 promoter (compare “7b,” “7a,” “7h,” “7p” and “7xp” to “7c,” Fig. 1B). However, although the Smad7 promoter region –180 to +336 displayed a similar behavior as the –3100 to +1502 region, further deletion of the 3′-end to +21 resulted in a dramatic loss in baseline and inducible promoter activity (see “7xs,” Fig. 1B); in fact, the very low activity of the 7xs construct was comparable to that seen with the empty pGL2-Basic vector. Thus, the Smad7 promoter region –180 to +336 appears to be responsible for the stimulation by HER2/Neu and ER81. Although we have shown that HER2/Neu and ER81 synergistically activate the Smad7 promoter, we wondered whether the small activation observed with HER2/Neu alone in RK13 cells could be accounted for by endogenous ER81 or related proteins. To this end we carried out transient transfections in the presence and absence of a dominant negative ER81 molecule consisting of the C-terminal fragment of ER81 (amino acids 333–477) that contains the ER81 DNA binding domain but is unable to activate transcription (46Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The presence of this dominant negative ER81 protein led to a dramatic reduction in the ability of HER2/Neu to activate the Smad7 promoter in the absence of ectopically expressed ER81 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the synergism in Smad7 stimulation observed upon co-expression of HER2/Neu and full-length ER81 was completely abrogated by ER81-(333–477). This implicates that transfected ER81 is necessary for efficient HER2/Neu-mediated activation of Smad7 reporter transcription. We also tested whether HER2/Neu and ER81 synergized in the activation of the Smad7 promoter in various cell lines other than RK13. Indeed, under all conditions tested, HER2/Neu and ER81 together activated Smad7 transcription more efficiently than when overexpressed alone in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 (Fig. 1D), the human endometrial cancer cell line HEC-1A (Fig. 1E), and in the human ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3 (see Fig. 4A). Thus, HER2/Neu and ER81 are able to jointly stimulate the Smad7 promoter in a wide variety of cell lines. Binding of ER81 to the Smad7 Promoter—Next we attempted to demonstrate binding of the ETS transcription factor ER81 to the Smad7 promoter. Within the Smad7 promoter region (–180 to +336) identified to confer inducibility by HER2/Neu and ER81, we noted only six ETS core sites of the sequence GGAA/T that are required for ETS proteins to bind to DNA (44Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, three of these are located in a very GC-rich region 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site and are therefore unlikely to be functional ER81 binding sites. Thus, we focused on the three other putative ETS core sites (see Fig. 1A), namely from –131 to –128 (ETS1 site), +50 to +53 (ETS2 site), and +55 to +58 (ETS3 site), none of which were part of a sequence perfectly matching the established ER81 consensus DNA binding site (52Brown T.A.

Radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to these three potential ETS sites within the Smad7 promoter were synthesized. Because of the proximity of ETS sites 2 and 3, only one common probe was used to investigate these two sites (ETS2/3) that are in opposite direction to each other (+50 GGAAGATCC +58, ETS core sites are underlined). In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, purified ER81 (249–477) protein, which contains the ETS DNA binding domain, failed to interact with the ETS1 site (Fig. 2A). However, ER81 readily associated with the ETS2/3 probe containing the closely juxtaposed ETS2 and ETS3 sites, and an anti-ER81 antibody elicited a respective supershift formation. Interestingly, much more DNA binding was observable in the presence of the anti-ER81 antibody that probably stabilizes DNA binding by relieving an intramolecular repression (42Bosc D.G. Goueli B.S. Janknecht R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6215-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 53Bosc D.G. Janknecht R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 86: 174-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, when the ETS2 site was mutated, ER81 binding was no longer observable (see ETSm2/3 in Fig. 2A). Similarly, binding of ER81 was dramatically reduced upon mutation of the ETS3 site (see ETS2/m3), and mutation of both ETS sites (see ETSm2/m3) resulted in no binding of ER81. These results suggest that ER81 binds to both ETS sites 2 and 3, albeit with a higher affinity to the ETS2 site as residual supershifted complexes were observable with the ETS2/m3 but not ETSm2/3 oligonucleotide (Fig. 2A). Consistently, a 50-fold excess of cold ETSm2/3 oligonucleotide was inefficient to compete with 32P-labeled ETS2/3 oligonucleotide for ER81 binding, whereas cold ETS2/m3 oligonucleotide was nearly as efficient as cold ETS2/3 oligonucleotide in these competition experiments (Fig. 2B). Next we set out to demonstrate binding of full-length ER81 to the ETS2/3 probe using the lysates of transfected 293T cells. We conducted respective electrophoretic mobility shift assays in the presence of the anti-ER81 antibody that stabilizes DNA binding. However, even in the presence of the anti-ER81 antibody, we were not able to demonstrate binding of full-length ER81 isolated from cells transfected with ER81 alone (Fig. 2C). Rather, binding was only evident with lysates from 293T cells transfected with both ER81 and HER2/Neu, and this binding could be abrogated in competition experiments with cold ETS2/3 oligonucleotide, but not ETSm2/m3. Similarly, E74, a known binding site for ETS proteins, including ER81 (46Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was able to efficiently compete for binding, whereas a mutated E74 site was not. In particular, note that one DNA·protein complex (marked “ETS?”) was also competed by unlabeled ETS2/3 and E74 oligonucleotides, suggesting that this complex may represent DNA binding of an endogenous ETS protein other than ER81. Altogether, we conclude that ER81 can bind to the Smad7 promoter upon stimulation by HER2/Neu. We wondered if ER81 binds to the juxtaposed ETS2 and ETS3 sites at the same time. To test this hypothesis we synthesized a double-stranded probe equal in length to the ETS2/3 probe, but replaced its two ETS sites with a single one, the E74 site (modE74 oligonucleotide). Because ER81 is known to associate with E74 as a monomer (46Janknecht R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), we compared the migration of protein·DNA complexes seen with the modE74 and ETS2/3 probes (Fig. 2D). We found that the complex formed between ER81 and ETS2/3 migrated slower than the ER81·modE74 complex, indicative of binding of two ER81 molecules to one ETS2/3 oligonucleotide. Furthermore, because we did not detect a 1:1 complex of the ET"

Laminin-5 has the ability to induce either stable cell adhesion or migration depending on specific processing of different parts of the molecule. One event results in the cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal globular domains 4 and 5 (LG4/5) of the α3 chain. In this study, we recombinantly expressed the human α3LG4/5 fragment in mammalian cells, and we show that this fragment induces adhesion of normal human keratinocytes and fibrosarcoma-derived HT1080 cells in a heparan- and chondroitin sulfate-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation experiments with Na235SO4-labeled keratinocyte and HT1080 cell lysates as well as immunoblotting experiments revealed that the major proteoglycan receptor for the α3LG4/5 fragment is syndecan-1. Syndecan-4 from keratinocytes also bound to α3LG4/5. Furthermore we could show for the first time that unprocessed laminin-5 specifically binds syndecan-1, while processed laminin-5 does not. These results demonstrate that the LG4/5 modules within unprocessed laminin-5 permit its cell binding activity through heparan and chondroitin sulfate chains of syndecan-1 and reinforce previous data suggesting specific properties for the precursor molecule.

At present, 15 heterotrimers termed LN-1 to LN-15 have been described with different subunit composition selected from five individual α chains (α1–α5), three β chains (β1–β3), and three γ chains (γ1–γ3) (1Colognato H.

All LN α chains comprise a large globular domain in their carboxyl-terminal region (G domain), which consists of five homologous globular subdomains of about 200 amino acids each (LG1–LG5). LN-5, with chain composition α3β3γ2, is a component of basement membranes underlying specialized epithelia with secretory or protective function (3Nishiyama T. Amano S. Tsunenaga M. Kadoya K.

In vivo, epidermal injury activates the transcription and deposition of LN-5 into the provisional matrix by the leading keratinocytes in the process of epidermal outgrowth and migration at the wound edge (24Kainulainen T.

These data indicate that the presence of the LG4/5 domain in the α3 chain of LN-5 may influence cell behavior.Several studies conducted with native and recombinantly expressed LG subdomains from various laminin isoforms have highlighted a potential cellular function of the LG4/5 domain. Purification of the cleaved LG4/5 domain from conditioned HaCat cells or normal human keratinocyte (NHK) media has permitted identification of the cleavage site in the spacer region between the G3 and G4 domains (7Tsubota Y.

Heparin binding properties of this fragment, combined with its cellular interaction activities, have allowed identification of a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG)-type cellular receptor. A recent study shows that syndecan-2- and -4-overexpressing 293T cells interact with recombinant α3LG4 (28Utani A. Nomizu M. Matsuura H. Kato K. Kobayashi T. Takeda U. Aota S. Nielsen P.K. Shinkai H.

To address these questions, we recombinantly expressed the human α3LG4/5 fragment, and we show that syndecan-1 from NHKs and other cells is the major receptor for this fragment. Syndecan-4 also bound to a much lesser extent. We purified unprocessed LN-5 and show for the first time that it binds syndecan-1, while the processed form does not.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Antibodies—Cell cultures of NHKs were established from foreskin as described previously (12Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and subcultured in KBM-2 medium (Clonetics, Biowhittaker, Vallensbaek Strand, Denmark). Cells were harvested for subculturing or for subsequent experiments using 0.05% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS). NHKs were used between passages 1 and 3. Fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080), skin epithelioid cells (A431), mammary epithelial cells (HBL100), and melanoma cells (A375) were provided by Prof. Aumailley (Center for Biochemistry, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. The HaCat human keratinocyte cell line, provided by Dr. Damour (Banque de Tissus et Cellules, Lyon, France), was grown in 50% Ham's F-12 and 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. Parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, called CHO-K1, and mutant CHO-677, CHO-745, and CHO-618 cell lines, developed by Esko et al. (31Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), were obtained from the European Collection of Cultured Cells. The cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal calf serum.The preparation and characterization of LN-5 antibodies, the monoclonal antibody (mAb) BM165 (anti-α3 chain), polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) 4101 (anti-α3, -β3, and -γ2 chains), mAb 6F12 (anti-β3 chain), and pAb against the native LG4/5 fragment (nLG4/5) have been described elsewhere (12Rousselle P.

Rabbit pAb H-174 against syndecan-1, pAb M-140 against syndecan-2, pAb M-300 against syndecan-3, pAb H-140 against syndecan-4, and mAb 5G9 against syndecan-4 were purchased from Tébu (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Le Perray en Yvelines, France). mAb MI15 against human syndecan-1 was from Dako (DakoCytomation, Trappes, France).Production of the Recombinant α3LG4/5 Fragment in Mammalian Cells—A DNA fragment encoding the human laminin α3LG4/5 domain (nucleotides 4057–5142) was generated by PCR. cDNA was obtained by reverse transcribing total RNA of SCC25 epithelial cells using the primer 5′-GCATTGGGTAATCAGTGCTTTTGAAGG. Two oligonucleotides flanking the desired sequence were designed. One, corresponding to the 5′-end of the domain, carried an SpeI site (underlined) (5′-CCTTACTAGTTTGCTCACCACTTCCCAAG), and the second, corresponding to the 3′-end of the domain, introduced a NotI site and a stop codon (5′-CCAAGCCTATTTCACAGCAAGGCGGCCGCTATG). The resulting PCR product of 1083 base pairs was restriction-digested with SpeI and NotI and was inserted in-frame with the BM-40 signal peptide in the mammalian expression vector pCEP-Pu (32Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All inserts and borders were fully sequenced. Recombinant plasmid was introduced by electroporation into the human embryonic kidney cell line 293-EBNA (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and grown to confluence. Secretion of the recombinant LG4/5 fragment (rLG4/5) into the medium was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of conditioned medium samples from transfected and wild type cells.Purification of the Recombinant α3LG4/5 Fragment in Mammalian Cells—To produce the recombinant protein, 293-EBNA cells were cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the conditioned medium was collected every 48 h. The medium was kept at –80 °C and proteolytic degradation was inhibited by the addition of 50 μm N-ethylmaleimide and 50 μm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride until use. For purification of rLG4/5, conditioned medium was applied to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences), and elution was achieved with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.1 to 1.2 m. Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE where it was estimated to be greater than 90%. Protein concentration was determined by microprotein assay using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) (Pierce).Purification of the Native α3LG4/5 Fragment as Well as the Processed and Unprocessed Native LN-5—The native LG4/5 was purified from conditioned NHK medium as described previously (27Décline F. Okamoto O. Mallein-Gerin F. Helbert B. Bernaud J. Rigal D. Rousselle P. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2003; 54: 64-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Processed LN-5 was purified from the culture medium of human SCC25 cells as described previously (15Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and unprocessed LN-5 was purified according to the protocol described by Amano et al. (9Amano S. Scott I.C. Takahara K. Koch M. Champliaud M.F. Gerecke D.R. Keene D.R. Hudson D.L. Nishiyama T. Lee S. Greenspan D.S. Burgeson R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22728-22735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of conditioned medium from NHKs cultured in KBM-2 medium with 0.015 mm CaCl2 (Clonetics) was precleared with gelatin-Sepharose and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column. The bound materials were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient from 0.15 to 0.75 m. Fractions eluting around 0.5 m were precipitated using trichloroacetic acid and further analyzed for their unprocessed LN-5 by transfer to nitrocellulose followed by immunodetection with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or by Coomassie staining of the gel (Biosafe, Bio-Rad).Flow Cytometry—Monolayer cells were harvested following exposure to PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in PBS containing 2% BSA, and centrifuged. Cells (3 × 105/sample) were suspended in staining solution (PBS, 1% BSA) containing saturating amounts of mAbs. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, cells were washed and suspended in staining solution containing fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-mouse IgG (Silenus, Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) or fluorescein isothiocyanategoat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France) depending on the primary antibody. After further incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, cells were washed, fixed, and analyzed with a flow cytometer (FACScan, BD Biosciences). A 2 μg/ml propidium iodide solution was added to one sample to determine the population of dead cells. Controls were carried out using isotype-matched antibodies or by omission of primary antibody.Cell Adhesion and Inhibition Assays—Multiwell tissue culture plates (Costar, Dutscher, Brumath, France) were coated with the indicated concentrations of processed LN-5 or LG4/5 substrates by overnight adsorption at 4 °C. Cells were detached by incubation with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and rinsed in the corresponding serum-free medium prior to the experiment. After saturation of the wells with 1% BSA, the plates were used immediately for cell adhesion assays (at the indicated number of cells per well) in serum-free medium as detailed previously (15Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The extent of adhesion was determined after fixation of adherent cells with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet and absorbance measurements at 570 nm using an MR5000 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. A blank value corresponding to BSA-coated wells (<5% of maximal cell adhesion) was subtracted. Adherent cells were photographed using a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a camera (Olympus Corp., Lake Success, NY). For cell adhesion inhibition experiments with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the coated wells were preincubated with heparin, heparan sulfate (HS) from bovine intestinal mucosa, chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4S) from bovine trachea, or chondroitin 6-sulfate (C6S) from shark cartilage (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and adhesion was measured in the presence of the inhibitors. In all experiments, each assay point was derived from triplicate measurements.Treatment of Cells with Enzymes Prior to Cell Adhesion and Interaction Studies—HT1080 cells and NHKs were treated with 25 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 and 1 h, respectively. All the following processes contained the same concentrations of cycloheximide. After detachment with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, the cells were washed four times in serum-free medium and then suspended in the same medium, and the calcium concentrations were adjusted to 2 mm followed by treatment with 8 milliunits/ml heparitinase I and/or 50 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC (Seikagaku America, Goger, Paris, France) for 1 h at 25 °C. For control experiments, cells were incubated in parallel with the corresponding buffers only. In cell adhesion experiments, the cells then were inoculated into the 96-well plates in the presence (or absence for the controls) of the same enzymes. For interaction studies on nitrocellulose, cells were homogenized with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) (as below) in ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and immediately incubated with membranes containing LG4/5.Immunoprecipitation—NHKs and HT1080 cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml sodium [35S]sulfate (Na235 SO4) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 16 h. After labeling, the cell layers were washed with PBS and extracted with RIPA buffer on ice for 10 min. All the following procedures were performed at 4 °C. Extracts were incubated for 2 h with Gamma Bind-G Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) previously incubated overnight with anti-syndecan-1 pAb (H-174), anti-syndecan-4 mAb (5G9), or anti-nLG4/5 pAb-rLG4/5 complex. The latter complex was obtained by incubating rLG4/5 with the beads carrying anti-nLG4/5 pAb for 2 h. In some experiments heparin was added during incubation. Beads carrying the immune complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer, and finally the complexes were separated by heating at 95 °C in denaturing sample buffer followed by separation using a 3–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel under reducing conditions. The gel was subjected to autoradiography followed by image analysis with a Storm gel and blot imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). For reimmunoprecipitation experiments, immune complexes formed on the beads carrying the anti-nLG4/5 pAb-rLG4/5 complex were eluted by heating at 95 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl containing 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4. The salt concentration of the eluate was brought to 0.25 m by dilution followed by reimmunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with beads carrying pAb H-174 and mAb 5G9 or beads carrying IgG from a preimmune rabbit. After incubation, the beads were washed with PBSTween (0.05%) and processed as above. In the experiments conducted with processed and unprocessed LN-5, the procedure was identical except that the mAb 6F12 against the laminin β3 chain was used to bind both forms of LN-5 to the Gamma Bind-G Sepharose beads.For detection of syndecans by immunoblot, rLG4/5 and processed or unprocessed LN-5 were covalently bound to beads to avoid constraints produced by immunoglobulin detection. The ligands were conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 mg of protein/ml of resin as described by the manufacturer. Beads were incubated with cell extracts and washed as described above. Beads were finally transferred in digestion buffer (20 mm sodium acetate containing 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.0) and incubated with 8 milliunits/ml heparitinase I and 50 milliunits/ml chondroitinase ABC for 2 h at 25 °C. The samples were then prepared and subjected to electrophoretic migration in a 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose followed by immunodetection with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus.Interaction of Syndecan-1 with Immobilized Proteins—BSA or rLG4/5 (1 μg) were blotted on a nitrocellulose filter previously soaked in distilled water and, after blotting, saturated overnight with BSA (5 mg/ml). Membranes were rinsed in PBS and then incubated for 2 h at +4 °C in the various cell lysates. After repeated washes of the membranes with RIPA buffer and one wash with PBS, syndecan-1 was immunodetected with pAb H-174 as described below.Biotinylation Procedure and Heparan Sulfate Immobilization—HS (from intestinal mucosa, Celsus) was biotinylated at the reducing end as described previously (33Sadir R. Baleux F. Grosdidier A. Imberty A. Lortat-Jacob H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8288-8296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly HS resuspended in PBS at 1 mm was incubated for 24 h at room temperature with 10 mm biotin-long chain-hydrazine (Pierce). The mixture was then extensively dialyzed against water to remove unreacted biotin and freeze-dried. Two flow cells of an F1 sensor chip (Biacore) were activated with 50 μl of a mixture of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 0.05 m N-hydroxysuccinimide before injection of 50 μl of streptavidin (0.2 mg/ml in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4). Remaining activated groups were blocked with 50 ml of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Typically this procedure allowed the coupling of ∼2500–3000 resonance units (RU) of streptavidin. Biotinylated HS, 50 μg/ml in HBS-P buffer (10 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005% P20, pH 7.4), was then injected on one of the two streptavidin-activated surfaces (the other one being a negative control) to yield an immobilization level of 30–40 RU. Both flow cells were then conditioned with several injections of 2 m NaCl. For binding and competitive analyses, rLG4/5, preincubated or not with GAGs, was injected over the HS surface at a flow rate of 80 μl/min after which the complexes formed were washed with HBS-P buffer. The sensor chip surface was regenerated twice with a 1-min pulse of 0.05% SDS followed by a 2-min pulse of 2 m NaCl in HBS-P buffer.Analytical Methods—The following procedures were performed as previously described: SDS-PAGE followed by the electrophoretic transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose with immunoblot analysis (15Rousselle P. Aumailley M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Silver staining was carried out with the Silver Stain Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad).RESULTSProduction and Purification of Recombinant α3LG4/5 Fragment—rLG4/5 was purified from the culture medium of 293-EBNA cells by affinity chromatography using a 1-ml HiTrap heparin column. Coomassie Blue staining of the fractions eluting at around 0.8 m NaCl revealed a band of about 40 kDa (Fig. 1, A and B), which corresponded to the predicted size of rLG4/5. Immunoblot analysis of these fractions, using pAb against nLG4/5 (27Décline F. Okamoto O. Mallein-Gerin F. Helbert B. Bernaud J. Rigal D. Rousselle P. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2003; 54: 64-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), revealed the peptide as the rLG4/5 domain (Fig. 1C). As previously described for the native fragment, rLG4/5 bound to the heparin affinity column required a NaCl concentration of 0.8 m to be eluted, demonstrating that a high affinity for binding to heparin is characteristic of this fragment. Comparison of native and recombinant LG4/5 by silver staining and immunoblot analysis revealed an identical electrophoretic pattern for both fragments (Fig. 1D).Cell Binding Activity of the Recombinant α3LG4/5 Fragment—We tested the ability of rLG4/5 to induce adhesion of normal cells and different cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2A, rLG4/5 promoted adhesion of several cell lines including HT1080, HBL100, and A431 cells in a dose-dependent manner, while it induced only weak adhesion of A375 cells. Maximum adhesion for all three cell types was obtained at concentrations of 10 μg/ml. The strong binding capacity of rLG4/5 to heparin suggested that adhesion might be mediated by cell surface HSPGs. This was verified by adding soluble heparin, which strongly inhibited cell adhesion to rLG4/5 (Fig. 2B). Inhibition was dose-dependent with half-maximal inh"

It is a cell cycle specific inhibitor at the G2/M transition. CDTB, one of the subunits of the CDT holotoxin, is implicated in a genotoxic role after entering the target cells, whereby chromosomal damage induces checkpoint phosphorylation cascades. CDTB microinjected into the cytoplasm was shown to localize in the nucleus and induce chromatin collapse. To investigate the molecular mechanism involved in nuclear transport of CDTB, we used transient expression and microinjection of a CDTB-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein. After microinjection, His-tagged CDTB-GFP entered the nucleus in 3–4 h. Leptomycin B did not increase the speed of entry of the fusion protein, suggesting that the relatively slow entry of the fusion protein is not due to the CRM1-dependent nuclear export of the protein. Nuclear localization of the CDTBGFP was temperature-dependent. An in vitro transport assay demonstrated that the nuclear localization of CDTB is mediated by active transport. An assay using transient expression of a series of truncated CDTB-GFP fusion proteins revealed that residues 48–124 constitute the minimum region involved in nuclear transport of CDTB. A domain swapping experiment of the region involved in nuclear transport of CDTB with an SV40 T nuclear localization signal indicated that CDTB is composed of two domains, an N-terminal domain for nuclear transport and a C-terminal active domain. Our results strongly suggest that nuclear localization of CDTB is required for the holotoxin to induce cytodistension and cell cycle block.

It has been identified in several pathogenic bacteria including Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Haemophilus ducreyi, Helicobacter hepaticus, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The cells intoxicated with CDT show a cytopathic effect and distension in cell size, and eventually they die, which has been shown to be a common consequence of CDT treated cells (1.Peres S.Y.

The CDT-induced G2 arrest has been ascribed to the inactivation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex, which is a key molecule for the progression of the cell cycle. In normal cells, dephosphorylation of the Thr-14 and Tyr-15 in Cdc2 triggers G2/M transition in the cell cycle. CDT-treated cells were found to maintain Cdc2 with these residues phosphorylated in the Cdc2-cyclin B complex (8.Comayras C. Tasca C. Peres S.Y. Ducommun B. Oswald E. De Rycke J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5088-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is because of the recruitment of Cdc25C, a Cdc2-specific phosphatase, from the nucleus to cytoplasm, which prevents dephosphorylation of the Cdc2-cyclin B complex in the nucleus (8.Comayras C. Tasca C. Peres S.Y. Ducommun B. Oswald E. De Rycke J. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5088-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.De Rycke J. Sert V. Comayras C. Tasca C. Eur. J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6296-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cdc25C is regulated by Checkpoint kinase 1 or 2, which are controlled by ATM or ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related) (13.Shiloh Y. Cur. Opinion Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Recently, two research groups indicated independently that CDT has structural homology to human DNase I and suggested that CDTB is an active component of the CDT complex acting as a DNase. In support of this, E. coli CDTB has been demonstrated to possess nicking activity toward purified plasmid in vitro (14.Elwell C.A. Dreyfus L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 952-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). These findings have raised the possibility that CDTB directly damages chromosomal DNA, which results in the onset of phosphorylation of the checkpoint control cascade described above. Lara-Tajero and Galan (15.Lara-Tejero H. Galan J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) demonstrated that transiently expressed or microinjected Campylobacter jejuni CDTB in the cultured cell cytoplasm accumulates in the nucleus, consistent with a possible nuclear function of CDTB.

In eukaryotic cells, a number of cellular proteins that function in the nucleus are imported or exported through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which forms a tunnel through the nuclear envelope (16.Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Dev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 17.Weis K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 18.Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although molecules smaller than 40–60 kDa pass by diffusion through the NPC, most of the macromolecules are generally carried by energy-dependent active transport. Such nuclear imported proteins have common features. For example they possess a conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS), which allows their rapid import via complex formation with carrier protein families in the cells. The classical monopartite or bipartite NLSs are characterized as lysine- or arginine-rich sequences, which bind to the carrier protein, importin-α. There are some variations of NLS that do not possess conserved basic amino acid residues, such as NLS in M9 (19.Pollard V.W. Michael W.M. Nakielny S. Siomi M.C. Wang F. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1996; 86: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) or the RPA protein (replication protein A) (20.Jullien D. Gorlich D. Laemmli U.K. Adachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4348-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). They are called atypical NLS, and the number of reports on atypical NLS are increasing (21.Worniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchinson J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 22.Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Herein, we demonstrate that the A. actinomycetemcomitans CDTB component is transferred to the nucleus by active transport. Furthermore, we have defined a unique and functional domain in the N-terminal segment of CDTB component that mediates nuclear import. We also demonstrated that nuclear entry of CDTB is required for the holotoxin to show cytodistension and cell cycle block. These studies strongly indicate that CDTB is a nuclear targeting genotoxin using the eukaryotic active transport system. Cell Culture and Plasmids—HeLa cells (ATCC CCL2) and other mammalian cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui) supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Plasmids and bacteria used in this study are listed in Table I. All E. coli were laboratory strains and grown aerobically in Luria Bertani (LB) medium or on LB agar plates. A. actinomycetemcomitans was grown in Trypticase Soy Broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 1% (w/v) yeast extract in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Ampicillin (50 μg/ml) or kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was added when necessary.Table IStrains, plasmids, and primers used in this study* Position corresponds to the DNA sequence published in GeneBank accession No. AB 011450 Open table in a new tab * Position corresponds to the DNA sequence published in GeneBank accession No. AB 011450 Manipulation of DNA and Plasmid Construction—The DNA region of A. actinomycetemcomitans cdtB gene, corresponding to the signal peptide-cleaved mature form of CDTB (23–283 aa), was isolated from A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 genomic DNA by PCR amplification, using specific primers containing restriction enzyme sites, for subcloning into vectors. Primers used in this study are listed in Table I. The PCR-amplified cdtB gene was once cloned into pGEM-T Easy PCR cloning vector (Promega) and was subcloned into the pET28a (Novagen), the histidine-tagged expression vector, or pFlag max (Kodak), the FLAG-tagged expression vector. Various cdtB deletion mutants were generated by PCR using primers listed in Table I. The deletion mutants were also cloned into the pGEM-T Easy and subcloned into the pEGFP-C1, green fluorescence protein fusion vector (Clontech). Preparation of CDTB Subunit—CDTB was highly expressed in recombinant E. coli carrying pET-cdtB in the presence of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at the point of OD660 = 0.5–0.7. After induction for 3 h at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifuge at 5000 × g for 5 min. Harvested bacterial cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) twice. Cells resuspended in PBS with 1% Triton X-100 were broken by an ultrasonic disrupter (TOMY) and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove unbroken cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g to remove the membrane fraction. The resulting supernatant was incubated with nickel-chelated agarose (Ni-NTA, Qiagen). Ni-NTA metal affinity purification was carried out according to the instruction manual from Qiagen. The Ni-NTA-purified CDT was further purified using high pressure liquid chromatography (Tosoh, Tokyo) equipped with a solvent delivery pump CCPM and UV8011 absorbance detector. A UnoS cation exchange chromatography column (Bio-Rad) was used for purification of CDTB protein. To obtain a better purification of CDTB protein, TSK gel G3000 PW (Tosoh) was used for gel permeation chromatography. Plasmid Transfection—Plasmids were delivered into HeLa and other mammalian cells by calcium phosphate methods. Cells were prepared at 1 × 105/ml in 5 ml on 60-mm tissue culture dish (Corning). Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was mixed with 500 μl of H2O and 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then 500 μl of 2× Hepes buffer (2.8 mm Na2HPO4, 280 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.1) was added to the DNA solution and kept at room temperature for 10 min. All of the solution was overlaid onto the cultured cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 12 h in a 5% CO2 incubator, cells were washed twice with PBS. 1.5 ml of glycerol-Hepes buffer (10% glycerol, 1× Hepes buffer) was added at room temperature for 30 s. Cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with 10% calf serum in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Microinjection—Microinjection was performed using the Eppendorf Injectman NI2. Purified proteins were adjusted to the concentration of 1 μg/μl and injected into the cytosol of cultured cells at a pressure of 50–120 hpa for a duration of 0.2 s. The cells injected with CDTB fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) were observed directly by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM 401). Cells without fluorophor were stained by immunohistochemistry. Briefly cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were again washed three times with PBS and added with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (blocking buffer) at room temperature for 10 min. The primary antibody in blocking buffer was overlaid on cells and kept at room temperature for 40 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS, and the secondary antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine in blocking buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After being washed with PBS three times, the cells were incubated with propidium iodide (PI) in PBS (5 μg/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. After being washed again with PBS three times, the cells were observed by confocal microscopy. Cytosol Preparation—Cytosol was prepared by the method described by Miyamoto et al. (23.Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were harvested by scraping in PBS and pelleted by centrifuge at 5000 × g for 5 min. Cells were washed in 5 ml of washing buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol), by centrifuge at 5000 × g for 5 min. Cells were then resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 10 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm cytochalasin B, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), kept on ice for 10 min, and homogenized for 5–10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. Lysed cells were centrifuged at 1,500 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the resultant supernatant was used as cytosol. In Vitro Transport Assay—An in vitro transport assay was carried out by the method described by Nagoshi and Yoneda (24.Nagoshi E. Yoneda Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2779-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HeLa cells (5 × 105/ml) grown overnight were washed twice with transport buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.5 mm EGTA), and digitonin was added at a concentration of 40 μg/ml. Cells were permeabilized by being kept on ice for 5 min and washed with transport buffer containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Permeabilized cells were overlaid with 1 μg/μl extracted cytosol, 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm phosphocreatine, 2 units/ml creatine kinase, 0.05 mm GTP, and the protein of interest. The in vitro transport assay was carried out by incubating cells at 30 °C for an appropriate time. Cells were washed twice with TB containing 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in TB for 10 min. Other Procedures—The cell cycle was analyzed by FACScan (FACS-Calibur, BD Biosciences) after staining cells with PI as described (2.Sugai M. Kawamoto T. Peres S.Y. Ueno Y. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara F. Suginaka H. Oswald E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5008-5019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude CDT holotoxin was prepared from the periplasmic space in E. coli possessing pTK3022 (2.Sugai M. Kawamoto T. Peres S.Y. Ueno Y. Komatsuzawa H. Fujiwara F. Suginaka H. Oswald E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 5008-5019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Routine DNA and protein manipulations were performed by standard procedures. All restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from Roche Applied Science or New England Biolabs (Beverley, MA). Other materials and chemicals used were from commercial sources. SV40 T NLS was expressed in recombinant E. coli carrying pGEX-SV40nls-gfp and purified using a glutathione-Sepharose column. CDTB Microinjected into Cytosol Translocates to the Nucleus—To know the final destination of the functional CDTB subunit, we first attempted to microinject the His-CDTB protein into the cytoplasm of cultured cells and trace its moiety. Microinjection of His-CDTB and subsequent immunostaining of the cells with anti-CDTB serum showed the nuclear localization of His-CDTB and confirmed the observation made on Campylobacter CDT (15.Lara-Tejero H. Galan J.E. Science. 2000; 290: 354-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Time course measurement of His-CDTB localization after microinjection revealed that His-CDTB entered into the nucleus 30 min after microinjection and remained in situ as late as 4 h (Fig. 1B). We simultaneously stained the cells with PI to observe the chromatin. PI staining showed chromatin disintegration at 4 h, but not at 1 h, suggesting that microinjected CDTB acts as a DNase or indirectly induces DNA injury. To exclude the possibility that His6 worked as a nuclear localization signal, we constructed the plasmid pFlag-cdtB to produce the FLAG-tagged CDTB and purified it by anti-FLAG antibody affinity chromatography. Microinjected FLAG-tagged CDTB also localized in the nucleus of HeLa cells by the detection of immunostaining using anti-CDTB serum (not shown). These results clearly indicated that A. actinomycetemcomitans CDTB, by itself, has an ability to localize in the nucleus. Nuclear Localization of CDTB Is Mediated by Active Transport—To exclude a possibility that CDTB is transported through the NPC by diffusion because of its relatively small molecular mass (28 kDa), we tried to use a fusion protein. We constructed a plasmid, pET-cdtB-gfp, that produces His-tagged CDTB-green fluorescence protein fusion (His-CDTB-GFP), which has a predicted molecular mass of 65.6 kDa. His-CDTBGFP can be monitored directly by confocal microscope without fixation or antibody reaction. After purification by affinity chromatography, His-CDTB-GFP was microinjected into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP, which is imported into the nucleus by a classical monopartite NLS (PPKKKRKVEDP), was used as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1B, microinjected GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP was imported into the nucleus in 30 min. Microinjected His-CDTB-GFP was also transported into the nucleus with relatively slow rate. After microinjection, His-CDTB-GFP was detected in the nucleus from as early as 2 h and apparently as late as 3 h, whereas GFP alone did not accumulate in the nucleus even after 4 h. It should be noted that even after 4 h the microinjected cells exhibited a fairly weak cytoplasmic staining besides the strong nuclear staining. These phenomena of His-CDTBGFP localization could be due to nuclear export of the protein. To address this possibility, cells were treated with an inhibitor of the CRM1-exportin pathway, leptomycin B (25.Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujisawa D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar), and the subcellular localization of microinjected His-CDTB-GFP was assessed. Leptomycin B was added to the cells prior to micro-injection and localization of His-CDTB-GFP was monitored up to 4 h. As shown in Fig. 1C, there was no difference in the import rate and the staining of the nucleus and cytoplasm irrespective of the presence or absence of leptomycin B. These data suggest that these phenomena do not result from CRM1-dependent nuclear export of His-CDTB-GFP. We next assessed the temperature dependence of His-CDTB-GFP nuclear transport. Incubation of cells on ice suddenly after microinjection prevented the transport of GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP into the nucleus as expected (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the nuclear transport of His-CDTB-GFP was prevented when the microinjected cells were placed on ice (Fig. 1B). The temperature dependence of His-CDTB-GFP nuclear localization prompted us to investigate the energy requirement for the nuclear import. We used the in vitro transport assay to identify the molecules necessary for CDTB-nuclear import. Digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells were overlaid with a solution containing His-CDTB-GFP, HeLa cell cytosol, energy regeneration components (ATP, GTP, phosphocreatine, and creatine kinase), and incubated at 30 °C for 4 h. As a control, GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP was used. The nuclear import of GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP has been shown previously to be energy-dependent, and we were able confirm these results (Fig. 2). Similarly, His-CDTB-GFP was able to enter into the nucleus in the presence of the cytosol extract and energy resources. The temperature dependence of the nuclear transport of His-CDTB-GFP was again confirmed using the in vitro transport system. In the absence of GTP/ATP, His-CDTB-GFP failed to enter into the nucleus. Treatment with apyrase, one of the ATP hydrolases, also abolished the entry of both His-CDTB-GFP and GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP into the nucleus. Wheat germ agglutinin is a lectin that presumably inhibits nuclear protein transport by interacting with the nuclear pore complex protein with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine moieties (26.Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 27.Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Ditworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1988; 52: 655-664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). When the permeabilized HeLa cells were preincubated with wheat germ agglutinin, nuclear entry of both His-CDTBGFP and GST-SV40 T NLS-GFP was inhibited. These results strongly suggested that nuclear import of CDTB required energy and that the His-CDTB-GFP passes through the nuclear pore complex just like other mammalian nuclear proteins. N-terminal Stretch of CDTB (48–124 aa) Is Responsible for Nuclear Localization—Because the amino acid sequence of CDTB does not contain a typical nuclear localization signal, it was of interest whether CDTB possesses functional region(s) involved in nuclear transport in the molecule. A preliminary trial to purify a series of truncated CDTB proteins using an E. coli-vector system was unsuccessful because of the instability of the recombinant products. Therefore, we switched to using direct expression of the truncated CDTB-GFP fusion protein in COS7 cells, and expression of truncated CDTB was verified by immunoblot analysis of the transfected cells (Fig. 3B). The cdtB gene was cloned in-frame into pEGFP-C1 and transiently transfected into COS7 cells to generate GFP fused to a mature form of CDTB (CDTB-GFP). As shown in Fig. 3C, GFP-CDTB was detected in the nucleus 4 h after plasmid transfection. In order to know the region involved in nuclear transport of CDTB, we first divided CDTB into two parts, the N-terminal (23–200 aa) and C-terminal (167–283 aa) domains, and constructed plasmids to express each fragment as GFP-fused protein in the cells. After plasmid transfection, localization of the GFP-fused protein was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3C, nuclear localization was observed in the cells expressing the N-terminal portion of CDTB fused to GFP but not in the cells expressing the C-terminal half fused to GFP. Therefore, we created a series of deletion constructs of the N-terminal portion of CDTB and searched for the region with which the fusion protein clearly localized into the nucleus. In some cases, the intensity of fluorescence appeared equal in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Finally, a region corresponding to 48–124 aa was found to be the minimum region responsible for nuclear localization of the CDTB molecule. Further deletion of either the N-terminal or C-terminal ends of this segment resulted in loss of function of the apparent nuclear localization. Similar results were obtained when HeLa cells were used to transiently express truncated CDTB-GFP fusion protein (not shown). We also tried to express GFP fused to CDTB 48–124 aa (GFP-CDTB-(48–124)) in other cell lines such as Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) and mouse keratinocyte (Pam). The accumulation of GFP-CDTB-(48–124) was also observed in the nucleus of these cells (not shown).Fig. 3Identification of region involved in nuclear transport of CDTB.

Secondary metabolites of fungal origin are invariably selected for their cytotoxic effects on unicellular competitors and, as part of chemical defense mechanisms (1Demain A.L. Appl. Microbiol.

Gliotoxin acts as a redox active toxin and in cell-free experiments has been shown to form mixed disulfides with accessible thiol residues on proteins or induce further oxidative modification. Thus, gliotoxin induces internal disulfide formation in proximal cysteine residues in creatine kinase (10Hurne A.M. Chai C.L. Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25202-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and forms stable mixed disulfides with cysteine residues on alcohol dehydrogenase (11Waring P. Sjaarda A. Lin Q.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The easily reduced disulfide bridge across the diketopiperazine ring defines the class and is essential for almost all biological activity of the toxins and has lent support to the idea that it is the disulfide form (I) that is the active moiety. Nevertheless, evidence has been presented that the dithiol form may undergo intracellular redox cycling, which may contribute to toxicity (12Munday R. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1982; 41: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 13Eichner R.D. Waring P. Geue A.M. Braithwaite A.W. Mullbacher A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3772-3777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gliotoxin has long been known to display a so called “mass effect” or an increased efficacy of cell killing as cell density decreases (14Jordan T.W. Pedersen J.S. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 85: 33-46PubMed Google Scholar, 15Eichner R.D. Al Salami M. Wood P.R. Mullbacher A. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 1986; 8: 789-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we show that only the natural (oxidized) form of gliotoxin is reversibly concentrated in a murine cell line. Uptake and cell killing is dependent on intracellular glutathione levels. Active concentration in cells is dependent on an external oxidizing environment and the normal intracellular reducing milieu maintained by glutathione. A simple model of toxin entry followed by rapid reduction to the cell-impermeant dithiol form explains active uptake and allows for minimal production of the toxin while enabling maximal concentration in a putative competitor organism that would be expected to be initially present at low cell density. Decreased intracellular glutathione following induction of apoptosis by gliotoxin results in release of active toxin, which is then made available for further cell killing. Chemicals—35S-Labeled gliotoxin was prepared and purified as described (16Waring P. Newcombe N. Edel M. Lin Q.H. Jiang H. Sjaarda A. Piva T. Mullbacher A. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Gliotoxin was prepared as a stock solution in absolute ethanol at 1 mg/ml. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Uptake of Labeled Gliotoxin—P388D1 cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cells were treated at various times and cell densities with gliotoxin of known specific activity. Cells were pelleted and washed once, the cell pellet was lysed in 5% SDS, and radioactivity was counted using a Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Counts/min was converted to mass of toxin using a standard curve, which was generated weekly. Initial rates of uptake were determined following a 20-s treatment with labeled toxin and rapid (5–10-s) pelleting of cells in a microcentrifuge without washing. In these experiments, extracellular gliotoxin could be allowed for, given the known concentration in extracellular fluid and the estimated volume of cell pellet (cells plus excess extracellular fluid amounted to less than 20 μl). This amounted to less than 2% of total cell-associated toxin. Volume of P388D1 Cells—Volume was determined by measurement of cell diameter on 15 cells chosen at random using a Bio-Rad Radiant 2000 confocal microscope. Under these conditions and using Z series, the cells were shown to be almost completely spherical. Intracellular concentrations of toxin were calculated on the basis of uniform distribution in cells. HPLC Analysis—HPLC was carried out using Beckman System Gold equipment. Cell pellets were lysed using cold 5% trichloroacetic acid degassed to inhibit subsequent oxidation of reduced toxin. Toxin was separated on a Phenomenex Hypersil C18 reverse phase column, eluted with a gradient of 5–40% aqueous acetonitrile, and detected by UV at 270 nm. In some cases, radiolabeled toxin from cells was analyzed by HPLC, and fractions were collected. These experiments showed that radiolabel was associated only with either reduced or oxidized toxin and that no other radiolabeled metabolites were present. In particular, we could detect no additional peaks that might correspond to the mono mixed disulfide between toxin and glutathione either inside the cell or in extracellular medium within the first 30 min of treatment. Flow Cytometric Analysis—Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was carried out on a BD LSR Benchtop Flow Cytometer with cells at 0.5–1 × 106/ml. Apoptosis quantification using propidium iodide (17Waring P. Khan T. Sjaarda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17929-17936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and monochlorobimane staining (18Rice G.C. Bump E.A. Shrieve D.C. Lee W. Kovacs M. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 6105-6110PubMed Google Scholar) were determined according to published procedures. Reduction of Gliotoxin by Glutathione—The rate of reduction of gliotoxin by glutathione was performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped flow reaction analyzer at 25 °C, monitoring an absorbance increase of reduced toxin at 250 nm. HPLC analysis showed that the only product of this reaction was the reduced toxin. Synthesis of the Simple Diprolyl ETP Toxin (IV)—This compound was synthesized according to the procedure in the literature (19Ohler E. Poisel H. Tataruch F. Schmidt U. Chem. Ber. 1972; 105: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Antiproliferative Effects—The effects of gliotoxin and analogues on cell growth were measured using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (20Hansen M.B. Nielson S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3353) Google Scholar). Toxin was diluted 2-fold down rows in 96-well plates, and cells at varying initial densities were added at time zero. Final cell numbers were assessed at 3–4 days as described. Cellular Glutathione—Intracellular glutathione and oxidized glutathione were determined using the OxisResearch GSH/GSSG-412™ assay kit, which uses the modified Tietze method to assess both the reduced and oxidized forms of glutathione. Active Uptake of Gliotoxin Requires the Bridged Disulfide Bond—We have previously reported that gliotoxin actively accumulates in a variety of cell types including human and murine cell lines as well as murine lymphocytes and that up to 40% of the total mass of toxin added to a cell suspension becomes cell-associated within 5–10 min (16Waring P. Newcombe N. Edel M. Lin Q.H. Jiang H. Sjaarda A. Piva T. Mullbacher A. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These experiments were carried out with cell densities of 1 × 106/ml. Because active uptake and extrusion of toxins from cells has important implications for both efficacy of action and development of resistance to chemotherapeutic agents (21Ines Borges-Walmsley M. Walmsley A.R. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 9: 71-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we decided to study the mechanism of this active uptake using the P388D1 murine tumor cell line. Treatment of P388D1 cells at 1 × 106/ml with gliotoxin resulted in a 300-fold accumulation of toxin (Fig. 2A), with maximal levels by 15–20 min. Almost 50% of the maximally accumulated toxin is present within 2 min. Table I shows typical experimentally determined intracellular concentrations for differing applied toxin concentrations. The table also shows predicted intracellular concentrations based on the proposed uptake mechanism (see below). Key to understanding the uptake mechanism was the observation that the biologically inactive bismethylthioether (22Mullbacher A. Waring P. Tiwari-Palni U. Eichner R.D. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (III) is not significantly concentrated in cells. In addition, extracellular agents known to reduce gliotoxin to the dithiol form also abrogate uptake (Fig. 2, B and C), indicating that the disulfide bridge is required for active accumulation of the toxin. We initially explored known possible mechanisms that may facilitate active uptake of small molecules. Initial rates of uptake showed saturation kinetics and were independent of Na+ (Fig. 2D) and unaffected by inhibitors of glucose transport or of amino acid uptake such as BCH (data not shown). Initial rates also showed a pH maximum at 7.0 with a fall in V0 at higher pH (data not shown). These data indicate that neither a sodium gradient (sugars) nor a proton gradient (peptides) (23Gould G.W. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 24Brodin B. Nielsen C.U. Steffansen B. Frokjaer S. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 90: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were required for active accumulation in cells.Table IIntracellular Gliotoxin Concentration in P388 Cells[GT]Applied[GT]i[GT]Calcμm0.125 ± 345.20.3115 ± 101351.0277 ± 304523.01020 ± 901360 Open table in a new tab Active Uptake of Gliotoxin Is Glutathione-dependent—We then sought alternative mechanisms that might account for active accumulation of only the oxidized form of the toxin. Uptake of gliotoxin was abrogated when cells were depleted of glutathione by diethyl maleimide or diamide. Inhibition of uptake parallels loss in cellular glutathione (Fig. 3, A and B). The effect of diamide is reversible, and the ability to concentrate gliotoxin in cells is restored when they are washed free of diamide and placed back into fresh medium (Fig. 3C). This is also true of the initial rate of uptake (Fig. 3D). This reversibility of uptake is due to rapid reduction of oxidized glutathione by glutathione reductase once the oxidative stress induced by diamide is removed. 1,3-Bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, an inhibitor of GSH reductase, inhibits recovery of GSH (Fig. 3E). The observed increase in glutathione over controls following diamide treatment and washing (mechanism unknown) is consistent with increased uptake as in Fig. 3C. The above data clearly demonstrate a requirement for intracellular glutathione in the accumulation of gliotoxin in P388 cells. In order to show that uptake was necessary for apoptotic cell killing, we transiently depleted cells of glutathione using diamide and treated them for a short period with unlabeled gliotoxin. Treated and control cells were then washed and placed back into fresh media and harvested 24 h later. Apoptotic cell death induced by gliotoxin was also dependent on intracellular glutathione and was abrogated by diamide (Fig. 3F). Transient depletion of glutathione by diamide had no long term effect on cell viability. It was possible that the driving force for toxin entry was provided by the large concentration gradient of glutathione across the cell membrane in the opposite direction. This would result in exchange of toxin molecules for glutathione as occurs in the OATP1 type exchanger. We eliminated this possibility by first showing that initial uptakes were unaffected by rifampicin, a known inhibitor of OATP1, and that there was no detectable glutathione effluxing from cells over the first 20 min of uptake of gliotoxin. Intracellular Gliotoxin Is Rapidly Reduced to the Dithiol Form—We then examined the intracellular nature of the accumulated toxin using HPLC. Intracellular gliotoxin was present predominantly in the reduced form (structure II; Fig. 1). By 2 min, the shortest sampling time possible for HPLC analysis, or at the time of maximum gliotoxin load, most of the toxin was reduced (Fig. 4, A–C). Reduced gliotoxin was unambiguously confirmed by retention times and the demonstration that, as expected, reduced gliotoxin from cell lysates subsequently oxidized back to I (Fig. 4D). Given that the small amount of oxidized toxin seen in Fig. 4C, for example, could arise from rapid autoxidation of a small amount of reduced toxin once cells are lysed, it is clear that almost all of the toxin in the cell is in the reduced form. Accumulation of toxin as the reduced form in the cell suggests a mechanism of rapid metabolic conversion of the toxin driving accumulation down a concentration gradient until equilibrium is reached. This would require both rapid conversion to reduced toxin and an equilibrium position favoring the reduced form. We have previously reported the equilibrium constant between gliotoxin and glutathione as 1200 m–1 (25Bernardo P.H. Chai C.L. Deeble G.J. Liu X.M. Waring P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 483-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This strongly favors the reduced form (II) in the presence of excess glutathione. Initial uptake of toxin is relatively fast, and, if our initial proposal is correct, would require rapid reduction of toxin by glutathione once it entered the cell. Initial experiments using conventional spectroscopy showed that the rate of reduction of gliotoxin by glutathione was very rapid, and stopped flow techniques were required to show that the apparent first order rate constant at 25 °C and pH 7.0 for formation of reduced gliotoxin from 50 μm gliotoxin was 37.4 s–1 in the presence of 5 mm glutathione. The latter is typical of intracellular glutathione levels. This corresponds to a half-life of 18.5 ms, more than rapid enough to account for the initial rates of uptake of gliotoxin if reduction is driving accumulation. Table II shows second order rate constants for reduction of gliotoxin at differing pH values. The apparent rates were first order in GSH and gliotoxin, and the second order rate constants increase ∼10-fold for each rise in pH, indicating that reduction occurs via attack of the thiolate of glutathione on the disulfide of the toxin as expected by analogy with similar mechanisms for reduction of somatostatin by glutathione (26Rabenstein D.L. Weaver K. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 61: 7391-7397Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Importantly, the presence of a mixed disulfide intermediate between toxin and glutathione could not be detected using HPLC or mass spectrometry as mentioned earlier for toxin-treated cells. Only the dithiol form (II) is detectable in the presence of glutathione, indicating that any putative mixed disulfide intermediate rapidly reacts with a second molecule of GSH to produce II and GSSG (26Rabenstein D.L. Weaver K. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 61: 7391-7397Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Table IISecond order rate constants for reduction of gliotoxin by glutathionepH 8.0pH 7.0pH 6.072.3 ± 0.97.67 ± 0.040.74 ± 0.02(1.92)(18)(187) Open table in a new tab A Simple Model for Uptake of Gliotoxin—These results led us to propose a simple redox mechanism that accounts for accumulation of the toxin in cells involving entry of the toxin into the cell followed by rapid reduction to the cell-impermeant reduced form of the toxin. Data from Table I were generated using 1 × 106 cells/ml. We determined that P388D1 cells have an average volume of 1.3 × 10–9 ml. For 106 cells, this corresponds to a total volume of 1.3 μl (i.e. a little more than 1000-fold greater than the extracellular volume in a typical experiment). In developing our model, we assume a total combined cellular volume (VC) of 0.001 liter in 1 liter of extracellular fluid (VE), corresponding very approximately to the ratio between the total volume of 106 cells in 1 ml of medium (i.e. we assume that the total volume of the cells can be assumed equivalent to a single volume VC. At equilibrium, we denote extracellular gliotoxin GTE, oxidized toxin entering the cell GTO, and reduced toxin in the cell GTR, as shown in Scheme 1. The initial concentration of toxin added to the cells we denote GTApplied. The following argument is independent of the route of entry of toxin. Initially for simplicity, we assume that 1 mol of gliotoxin is added to VE (i.e. GTApplied = 1 m), and at equilibrium m mol of toxin have entered VC. The following relationships hold: (i) at equilibrium the external toxin concentration is (1 – m)M, since VE = 1 liter; (ii) the total intracellular toxin concentration will be m/VCm (i.e. the concentration assessed using radiolabeled toxin, which cannot discriminate reduced from oxidized form of toxin); (iii) ([GTR] × [GSSG])/([GTO] × [GSH]2) = 1200 m–1 by definition; (iv) m/VC = [GTO] + [GTR] by definition. We assume (v) the concentration of glutathione does not drop significantly over the time required for toxin accumulation (supported by experimental data; see below); (vi) intracellular reduced gliotoxin, GTR, does not significantly efflux from cells (the reduced form remains in the cell for at least 20 min; Fig. 2A); and (vii) GTO is in equilibrium with GTE, and rapid efflux of oxidized gliotoxin following diamide treatment supports this. From (iii) above [GTR]/[GTO] = 1200 × ([GSH]2/[GSSG]) = P, a constant (given point V above). Thus, [GTR] = P × [GTO], and thus m/VC = [GTO] + P × [GTO]. However, [GTO] = [GTE] = (1 – m)/V0 or (1 – m), since V0 = 1 liter. Thus, m/VC = (1 – m) + P × (1 – m), which can be solved for m, giving the equation, m = (VC × (1 + P))/(1 + VC + P × VC) or m/VC = (1 + P)/(1 + VC + P × VC) for 1 mol of toxin added (i.e. 1 m initial concentration). The following can then generally be easily shown,m/VC(or[GT]i)=([GTApplied]×(1+P))/(1+VC+P×VC)(Eq. 1) where [GTApplied] represents any initial concentration of toxin applied to the cell suspension in appropriate units, and P = Keq × ([GSH]2/[GSSG]), where Keq is the equilibrium constant between gliotoxin/GSH and reduced gliotoxin/GSSG, and VC is the total volume of cells in unit volume of extracellular fluid. This describes the equilibrium concentration of toxin in the cell. Thus, m/VC, which we denote [GT]i or the total intracellular concentration of toxin (reduced plus oxidized form), can be expressed in terms of the applied concentration, the number of cells (equivalent to VC), the equilibrium constant for reduction of the toxin by glutathione (Keq), and the [GSH]2/[GSSG] ratio. Experimental Justification of the Model—In P388 cells, we determined [GSH] to be 4.67 ± 0.67 mm, assuming uniform distribution, and the value of [GSH]/[GSSG] was 198 ± 76. We also note that GSH and GSSG levels in cells treated with up to 10 μm gliotoxin were also determined in this way. Gliotoxin had no effect on either GSH or GSSG levels up to 30 min after treatment with toxin. Using VC = 0.0013 (based on 106 cells/ml), Table I shows that calculated intracellular gliotoxin is in remarkable agreement with the experimentally determined values when equilibrium is reached, consistent with the proposed model. The model overestimates [GT]i probably because of wash out when measuring toxin loads and lack of homogeneity in cellular GSH. Equation 1 also predicts that there is a linear relationship between applied toxin and [GT]i and furthermore that the slope of the line should increase with decreasing cell density. This is confirmed in Fig. 5A. For a given applied concentration, toxin load will increase as cell numbers (VC) decrease, approaching a maximal value determined by (P + 1). The most dramatic consequences of this model, however, follow from the prediction that, for a given applied extracellular concentration of toxin, intracellular toxin loads should increase and approach a constant maximum value when cell density approaches a very small number. This is shown in Fig. 5B, where the intracellular gliotoxin clearly approaches a value between 1500 and 2000 μm as cell density decreases when cells are treated with 1 μm gliotoxin. Approach to constant intracellular load as VC approaches zero is consistent with the predictions of Equation 1, which predicts a limiting value of about 1200 μm for Fig. 5B. Efficacy of Cell Killing by Gliotoxin is Cell Density-dependent—Gliotoxin is a potent antiproliferative agent, and nanomolar EC50 values have been reported (27Ernst-Russell M. Chai C.L.L. Hurne A.M. Waring P. Hockless D.C.R. Elix J.A. Aust. J. Chem. 1999; 52: 279-283Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because of the results shown in Fig. 5B, we measured the effectiveness of gliotoxin as an antiproliferative agent against P388D1 cells at various cell densities. The EC50 values thus determined show a rapid convergence to a limiting value of under 3 nm as shown in Fig. 5C. It is axiomatic that for a toxic molecule of given structure and for a given cell type under defined conditions, there will be a unique average intracellular concentration that will determine its efficacy as determined by EC50 values. Equation 1 can be simply reformulated as follows.[GTApplied]=[GT]i×(1+VC+P×VC)/(1+P)(Eq. 1) Thus, the magnitude of [GT]Applied, which determines the experimental EC50 value, required to establish some constant intracellular concentration ([GT]i) will approach a minimal value determined by P as the cell numbers approach zero. This is exactly the behavior shown in Fig. 5C, where the EC50 value approaches 2–3 nm as cell density approaches zero. Similar behavior is shown by other members of the ETP family (data not shown). This model thus provides a simple explanation for the “mass effect” of ETP toxins, where efficacy of biological effect is dependent on cell density. Gliotoxin-induced Glutathione Loss Results in Efflux of Oxidized Toxin—Gliotoxin induces apoptotic death that is associated with a concomitant drop in intracellular glutathione (28Beaver J.P. Waring P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 68: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar). Efflux of glutathione has also been shown to occur in apoptotic cell death triggered by other stimuli (29van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Nobel C.S. Schlegel J. Cotgreave I.A. Orrenius S. Slater F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15420-15427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In our proposed model, we assume that GSH levels remain constant over the period during which we measure uptake of toxin (i.e. 10–15 min). This can occur by rapid regeneration of GSH from GSSG by glutathione reductase and is supported by data in Fig. 3E.In fact, GSH levels do not drop in gliotoxin-treated cells for at least 60 min after treatment (Fig. 5D), justifying our assumption in the development of our simple model. This also shows that exposure of cells to gliotoxin does not simply result in GSH loss by simple chemical depletion. We then examined the fate of the accumulated gliotoxin after induction of apoptotic cell death. Cells treated with gliotoxin, washed, and placed back into fresh medium release gliotoxin as the oxidized form as shown in Fig. 4G. Table III shows the kinetics of released gliotoxin from otherwise unperturbed cells and shows that diamide-treated cells release gliotoxin much more rapidly after preloading with the toxin. This confirms that the dithiol form does not easily pass through the cell membrane, whereas the oxidized (normal) form can. It also provides evidence that gliotoxin is not held in the cell by covalent interaction with proteins via disulfide bonds. The latter would be released by reducing conditions rather than oxidative ones. In our model, efflux would be hastened by attempts to re-establish equilibria with extracellular toxin if cells were washed and placed into fresh medium. We therefore examined efflux of toxin from unwashed, unperturbed cells (i.e. in the presence of equilibrium oxidized toxin). This showed a correlation between apoptosis, loss in glutathione levels, and net loss of toxin from cells. In other words, triggering of apoptosis, which results in GSH loss, also results in loss of oxidized toxin from the cell, because the equilibrium in Scheme 1 is now disturbed. As expected, the toxin that is released remains biologically active (Fig. 5, E and F). In Fig. 5E, the fraction of toxin cell associated following treatment is just less than 50% as assessed by counts in the supernatant (and consistent with Table I). This increases to 100% release by 18 h. Thus, most of the toxin taken into the cell is released and can be “recycled” following induction of apoptotic cell death.Table IIIEfflux of gliotoxin from P388D1 cellsTimeGliotoxinminμm300.57 ± 0.15aCells were treated with 10 μm toxin for 10 min, washed, and placed into fresh medium.

Open table in a new tab Uptake and Cytotoxicity Is Abrogated in a Simple Analog with Reduced Reduction Potential—Our model suggests that reduction potential is a strong determinant of uptake of gliotoxin and thus of biological activity. A corollary of this is that an ETP toxin with lower reduction potential would be both less active and concentrate in cells less efficiently than the natural product. In our screening of synthetic ETP toxins, we found that the synthetic diprolyl ETP toxin (IV) had dramatically reduced biological activity compared with the natural product. Compound IV has an EC50 value of 0.94 ± 0.15 μm compared with a value for gliotoxin of 0.058 ± 0.01 μm for inhibition of proliferation of P388D1 cells under identical conditions. This represents less than 6% activity of the natural product. Uptake of IV also occurs with concomitant reduction to the dithiol form (Fig. 4, E and F), although its concentration in cells was only 2% of that of the natural product at the same concentration. We determined the equilibrium constant for reduction of IV with glutathione as 6.8 ± 0.5 m–1. This makes the value of P some 175-fold less than that for gliotoxin, consistent with both the reduced toxicity and reduced intracellular levels of compound IV. The reason for the greatly reduced reduction potential of this synthetic ETP toxin is unknown but may be related to favorable release of strain when in the disulfide form. We are currently examining structural requirements that determine reduction potential in ETP toxins. Much effort is expended on studies of structure-activity relationships in attempts to delineate the pharmacophore in a biologically active molecule. This includes attempts to correlate reduction potentials in redox-active toxins such as quinones to biological activity (30Paz M.M. Das A. Palom Y. He Q.-Y. Tomasz M. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 2834-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This type of study often focuses on the intracellular site of action of the toxin rather than considering secondary effects such as the effective intracellular concentration of the toxin, which must contribute to the efficacy of the toxin. In this work, we show that the unique structural features of gliotoxin confer the ability of reversible accumulation in cells by a redox mechanism resulting in very high intracellular concentrations and thus high efficacy in cell killing. Furthermore, examination of an analogue with greatly diminished biological activity confirmed that the redox potential of the toxin determines its intracellular concentration and hence its efficacy. Although the precise mechanism of induction of apoptotic cell death by ETP toxins is unknown, putative targets include thiol-dependent enzymes such as creatine kinase (10Hurne A.M. Chai C.L. Waring P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25202-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the transcription factor NF-κB (9Pahl H.L. Krauss B. Schulze-Osthoff K. Decker T.

In all instances, the efficacy of the toxin will depend on the effective intracellular concentration of the molecule. This work still leaves open the possibility that either the reduced or oxidized forms are responsible for toxicity once in the cell, since there will be a small but finite quantity of oxidized form available for interaction with proteins. The presence of the reduced toxin in significant amounts will then act as a pool for more of the oxidized form once the equilibrium established by GSH is disturbed. The model does provide an explanation for the observation that activity is only associated with the oxidized form when presented outside of the cell. Design of analogs of gliotoxin with varying reduction potentials to achieve differential intracellular concentrations is under way. It may also be possible to conjugate a second molecule to the ETP skeleton to affect active transport of a second toxin into a cell. This will occur in a glutathione-dependent manner. Understanding the generality of this process may aid in overcoming the problem of drug-resistant cells associated with increased production of glutathione (34Perek N. Denoyer D. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Selection of gliotoxin by a fungi as part of a chemical defense mechanism against unicellular competitors has obvious advantages. Glutathione has been detected in many healthy single cell organisms (35Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 52: 711-760Crossref Scopus (6000) Google Scholar). Thus, uptake of gliotoxin into cells is facilitated by subversion of a normally protective mechanism to affect intracellular concentrations that are orders of magnitude greater than the extracellular concentration of toxin. Accumulation requires a normal, external oxidative milieu and a strongly reducing intracellular environment. Importantly, no mixed disulfide with glutathione is detectable that would represent a possible detoxification step; instead, the membrane-impermeant dithiol is the only product reversibly formed. This process has a direct parallel in the uptake and subsequent release of Fe(II) from extracellular siderophore bound Fe(III) after transport of the latter into bacterial cells (36Neilands J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26723-26726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). We believe this is the first example of a naturally occurring toxic secondary metabolite that has exploited the difference in redox state outside and inside the cell to affect reversible intracellular accumulation. The reductant does not have to be limited to glutathione and could include other small molecules such as lipoic acid or coenzyme A. The latter is present in many Gram-positive bacteria that are generally low in glutathione (37Fahey R.C. Brown W.C. Adams W.B. Worsham M.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unicellular competitors would be expected to be initially present at low numbers, and here we show that these conditions would favor maximum accumulation of toxin in healthy cells. Furthermore, data in Fig. 5A show that greater incremental increases in intracellular toxin will occur for a given incremental change in applied toxin as the cell density approaches zero, again maximizing efficient use of the secreted toxin. ETP toxins are unique in that the presence of the internal disulfide bond allows reduction to be easily reversed under appropriate conditions, reforming the oxidized (natural) form of the toxin, which then effluxes from the cell. This suggests an elegant mechanism involving rapid uptake and killing of cells followed by recycling toxin from apoptotic cells to enter and kill bystander cells, maximizing the efficiency of this naturally occurring cytotoxic agent. Release of toxin from cells triggered to undergo apoptosis could minimize further covalent interaction with protein that would be wasteful and unproductive. Although our model, which describes the equilibrium levels of toxin in the cell, is independent of the route of entry through the plasma membrane, saturation kinetics suggests specific facilitated transport of the oxidized form rather than diffusion. Lack of diffusion of high concentrations of reduced toxin from the cell also supports this. We are currently investigating a possible transport mechanism involved in carrying the toxin across the plasma membrane of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. We are grateful for excellent technical assistance from Geoff Osborne and Sabine Gruninger for help with flow cytometry and Cathy Gillespie for help with confocal microscopy."

The transcription factor NF-κB acts as a central regulator of inflammatory, immune, and stress responses by controlling gene expression of cytokines, chemokines, immunoreceptors, antigen-presenting proteins, growth factors, transcription factors, cell adhesion molecules, stress response proteins, and apoptotic regulators (1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 2Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Members of Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family include Dorsal, Relish, and Dif in Drosophila and p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p50/p105, and p52/p100 in vertebrates. All of these proteins have a highly conserved DNA-binding and dimerization domain called the Rel homology domain. The vertebrate Rel family proteins can form homodimers or heterodimers that bind to 10-basepair κB sites in the promoters of NF-κB target genes (1Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3464) Google Scholar, 3Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

The most common and important NF-κB transactivating species is the p50/p65 heterodimer. The p65 subunit, which contains a transactivation domain in the C terminus of the Rel homology domain, is responsible for the ability of NF-κB to stimulate transcription. By contrast, p50 subunit, which lacks a transactivation domain, functions mainly in NF-κB DNA binding (5Ballard D.W. Dixon E.P. Peffer N.J. Bogerd H. Doerre S. Stein B. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Another important dimeric species, the p50/p50 homodimer, serves mainly as a negative regulator of NF-κB activity through competing with p50/p65 for NF-κB response elements on DNA and through its association with co-repressor histone deacetylase (10Zhong H.

The x-ray crystal structures of p50/p65 heterodimer and p50/p50 and p65/p65 homodimer binding to DNA have revealed a conformation often referred to as a “butterfly” (12Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q.

The DNA recognition loop (L1) in the N-terminal half of NF-κB Rel homology domain mediates base-specific DNA contacts, whereas the C-terminal half is responsible for dimerization and nonspecific DNA contacts (17Chen F.E.

In most cell types, p50/p65 heterodimers exist in the cytoplasm as an inactive form associated with the inhibitor protein, IκB.

Phosphorylated IκB-α is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (27Alkalay I. Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Orian A. Ciechanover A. Ben-Neriah Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), enabling NF-κB to rapidly enter the nucleus where it binds to κB sites of target promoters and activates gene transcription. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that NF-κB nuclear localization is regulated by reversible acetylation of its p65 subunit. Acetylation of p65 by CBP/p300 prevents binding to nuclear IκB-α, whereas deacetylation of p65 by HDAC promotes efficient binding to nuclear IκB-α and allows an IκB-α-dependent nuclear export of the NF-κB complex (29Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). At the gene promoter level, the ability of NF-κB to bind DNA and to activate gene transcription is controlled by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of the p65 subunit regulates the transcriptional activity of NF-κB. Specifically, when serine 276 (Ser276) in the Rel homology domain is phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit, p65 is able to associate with coactivator CBP/p300, whereas unphosphorylated p65 associates with corepressor histone deacetylase (10Zhong H.

In addition, Ser529 and Ser536 in the p65 transactivation domain are phosphorylated by casein kinase II and IKKα, respectively, which increase NF-κB transactivation potential (30Zhong H. SuYang H.

On the other hand, phosphorylation of the p50 subunit regulates the DNA binding of NF-κB. The NF-κB p50 subunit is known to be phosphorylated on serine residues, and much less significantly on threonine residues, but not on tyrosine residues (35Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li C.C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated the biological significance of p50 phosphorylation on NF-κB DNA binding. In tumorigenic adenovirus type 12 transformed cells, NF-κB is translocated into the nucleus but fails to bind to DNA, mainly because of the hypophosphorylated state of the p50 subunit (37Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon cytokine treatment (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β) of Ad12-transformed cells, p50 becomes phosphorylated, allowing NF-κB to bind to DNA (38Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3212-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that p50 phosphorylation induced by phorbol ester increases the binding affinity and stability of NF-κB DNA complex (39Li C.C. Dai R.M. Chen E. Longo D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30089-30092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to regulation of transcriptional activation by p65 phosphorylation, regulation of DNA binding by p50 phosphorylation represents another important regulatory mechanism for NF-κB. This regulation is extended to p50/p50 homodimers, which occupy the same binding sites as NF-κB (p50/p65) and, in general, serve to repress transcription from NF-κB inducible promoters. However, the p50 phosphoresidues critical for its DNA binding are yet to be identified. In this study, we reveal for the first time that phosphorylation of a single residue of p50 (Ser337) is essential for DNA binding by the p50 subunit. Our results provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms that regulate nuclear NF-κB activity. Cell Lines—Monolayer cultures of COS-7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Whole Cell Extract Preparation—Cells from a 10-cm dish were washed twice with 5 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off with a rubber policeman in 0.9 ml of cold 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and pelleted by microcentrifuge at 6000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of cold 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and lysed by “freeze-thawing” four times with dry ice-ethanol and 37 °C water. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction (whole cell extract) was stored as aliquots at -80 °C. Plasmids—pGEX-mp50 plasmid was constructed by subcloning cDNA sequence encoding residues 1-363 of mouse p50 protein into pGEX4T-2, which was used as the template for further mutagenesis to produce bacterial mutant p50 proteins. pCMV-hp50 (40Smirnov D.A. Hou S. Liu X. Claudio E. Siebenlist U.K. Ricciardi R.P. Virology. 2001; 284: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) contains a cDNA sequence encoding residues 1-399 of human p50 flanked by T7 and Sp6 promoters and was employed as the template for mutagenesis for mutant p50 plasmids used in COS-7 cell transfection. Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with either a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions or by a PCR method. Briefly, to mutate p50 sequences in pCMV-hp50 by PCR, two complementary oligonucleotides harboring the desired mutations were used in combination with T7 and Sp6 primers to amplify separately two DNA fragments of p50 with annealing ends containing the mutations in the first PCR round. The two annealed DNA fragments were then used as the template together with T7 and Sp6 primers to amplify the full-length p50 sequence with the desired mutations. The products from the second PCR round were subcloned into pCMV plasmids. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—A double-stranded oligonucleotide probe (5′-tcgAGGGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCTg-3′) of the MHC class I R1 enhancer site, which contains a recognition sequence for NF-κB, was labeled using [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Klenow enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA band-shifts were analyzed as described previously (38Hou S. Guan H. Ricciardi R.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3212-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Kralli A. Ge R. Graeven U.

Cell Transfection—Transfection of COS-7 cells was performed with GeneJammer Transfection Reagent (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immune Assays—Immune assays were performed as described previously (37Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2169-2179Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-p50 antibody 1157 and anti-p65 antibody 1226 for immunoprecipitation (37Kushner D.B. Ricciardi R.P. Mol. Cell.

Goat anti-human p50 antibody C-19, raised against a peptide mapping to the C terminus of human NF-κB p50, was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The phospho-(Ser/Thr) PKA substrate antibody, purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, is a rabbit polyclonal antibody that detects proteins containing phospho-Ser/Thr with Arg at the -3 position. Western blots with the PKA substrate antibody were performed following the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—Coupled in vitro transcription-translation was performed using a TnT kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assay with bacterial p50 proteins was performed as described previously, with modifications (43Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial p50 proteins (4 μg) were incubated with 5 units of purified PKA catalytic protein (Sigma) at 30 °C for 1 h in 1× kinase buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP at 167 μCi/ml (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μm ATP). GST-p50 fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose beads, washed extensively with NTNZ (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% NP-40, 10 μm ZnCl2), and resolved on a SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Alternatively, the in vitro kinase assay was performed without [γ-32P]ATP, and the p50 proteins were tested for their DNA binding ability in EMSA with 32P-labeled R1 oligonucleotides. Ser65, Ser337, and Ser342 of p50 Are Critical for DNA Binding—Members of the Rel protein family are known to be phosphorylated. For example, in response to stimuli, the Drosophila NF-κB homologue, Dorsal, is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm on serine residues Ser70, Ser79, Ser103, Ser213, Ser312, and Ser317 (44Drier E.A. Huang L.H. Steward R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 556-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45Whalen A.M. Steward R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Both NF-κB p50 and p65 subunits were also shown to be phosphorylated on serine residues (36Li C.C. Korner M. Ferris D.K. Chen E. Dai R.M. Longo D.L. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Specifically, p65 transactivation activities are regulated by phosphorylation on Ser276, Ser529, and Ser536 (10Zhong H. May M.J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the phosphoresidues on p50 have yet to be identified. To determine the potential phosphoresidues that are critical for p50 DNA binding in vivo, we tested the DNA binding abilities of wild type and point mutant p50 proteins in a mammalian cellular environment. All 16 of the serine residues in the human p50 protein Rel homology domain were substituted with alanine. Wild type and mutant p50 plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells, which have very low background expression of NF-κB proteins. After 48 h, whole cell extracts of COS-7 cells were prepared, and the overexpressed exogenous p50 proteins were examined for their abilities to bind to an R1 DNA oligonucleotide. As shown in Fig. 1A, untransfected COS-7 cells exhibited negligible NF-κB DNA binding (lane 1), as expected. Of all the mutant p50 proteins, only three, S65A, S337A, and S342A, displayed dramatically reduced DNA binding abilities as compared with the wild type p50 (compare lanes 4, 17, and 18 with lane 2). All of the other serine to alanine mutations had no significant effect on DNA binding. In addition, we also selected the most highly conserved threonine residues in p50 based on the homology among p50, p65, and Dorsal proteins and replaced them with alanine to test their effects on p50 DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 1, p50 mutants T158A, T228A, T263A, and T341A were still capable of binding to DNA (compare lanes 19-22 with lane 2). Western blotting with anti-p50 antibody was performed to confirm the presence of equal amounts of exogenous p50 proteins (Fig. 1B). It was confirmed in vitro that residues Ser65, Ser337, and Ser342 are critical for p50 DNA binding. Bacterially produced wild type and mutant p50 proteins were kinased by wheat germ extract. Whereas the DNA binding activities of wild type and several other p50 mutant proteins were strongly increased when kinased, the DNA binding activities of the p50 mutants S65A, S337A, and S342A were unaffected (data not shown). Dimerization of p50 Is Not Affected by Mutating Ser65, Ser337, or Ser342—The x-ray crystal structures of the p50/p50 homodimer and p50/p65 heterodimer binding to DNA have been solved (12Chen F.E. Huang D.B. Chen Y.Q. Ghosh G. Nature. 1998; 391: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 13Chen Y.Q. Sengchanthalangsy L.L. Hackett A. Ghosh G.

Rey F.A. Sodeoka M. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Based on the structural information, Ser65 resides in the DNA recognition loop of p50 but does not directly contact DNA (Fig. 2). Ser337 and Ser342 are located on the outside surface of the C-terminal domain of p50 and are distal from both the DNA binding interface and the p50 dimerization interface (Fig. 2). Although we have demonstrated a requirement of these three serine residues for efficient DNA binding, it was important to ascertain that mutation of these residues does not simply interfere with the ability of p50 to dimerize, which is required for DNA binding. The p50 mutants S65A, S337A, and S342A were coexpressed, respectively, with p65 and labeled with 35S by in vitro transcription and translation followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-p65 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 3, wild type and all three mutant p50 proteins (S65A, S337A, and S342A) could be coimmunoprecipitated with p65, with the same apparent efficiency (lanes 5-8). The equal expression of wild type and mutant p50 proteins was confirmed by expressing p50 alone followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-p50 antibody (Fig. 3, lanes 1-4). These results clearly demonstrate that the inability of these three mutant p50 proteins to bind DNA is not merely because of a failure to dimerize. Ser337 of p50 Is a Phosphoresidue Critical for DNA Binding—We next wished to inquire whether phosphorylation of residues 65, 337, and 342 are important for p50 DNA binding. First, Ser65, Ser337, and Ser342 were mutated to aspartic acid (Asp), which contains a negative charge and can sometimes mimic phosphorylated serines. As shown in Fig. 4A, the p50 mutant proteins S65D, S337D, and S342D failed to bind DNA (lanes 3-5). We then investigated whether replacing these residues with threonine, a phospho-accepting amino acid that can generally substitute for serine, could restore the DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 4A, p50 mutant proteins S65T and S337T could bind to DNA as capably as wild type p50 (compare lanes 6 and 7 with lane 2), suggesting that the potential phosphorylation of Ser65 and Ser337 is essential for efficient DNA binding. Interestingly, threonine could not replace serine at residue 342, as the DNA binding ability of mutant p50 S342T was seriously impaired (Fig. 4A, lane 8). This suggested either that Ser342 is not phosphorylated or that a serine at residue 342 is specifically required for the phosphorylation at this position. Western blotting confirmed the expression of mutant exogenous p50 proteins (Fig. 4B). Even though the above results identified three important serine residues (Ser65, Ser337, and Ser342), we consider that Ser337 is most likely a phosphoresidue that is critical for DNA binding. The sequence surrounding Ser337, LRRKSDLE, is a consensus substrate site for many kinases, including PKA, and Ser337 can be substituted with threonine, a potential alternate phospho-accepting species. Moreover, the position of Ser337 is fully exposed, providing easy access for a kinase. On the other hand, Ser65 and Ser342 are not part of any known kinase consensus sequences. Further, Ser65 is mostly likely to be sensitive to mutation because of its position on the DNA recognition loop of p50 (Fig. 2). The ability of threonine to substitute for Ser65 may simply be because this conservative mutation is not disruptive to the structure of the p50 DNA recognition loop (see “Discussion”). Thus, although we cannot definitively rule out the possibility that Ser65 and Ser342 are phosphoresidues important for DNA binding, we focused on Ser337 to further investigate the effect of its potential phosphorylation on DNA binding. We examined whether Ser337 is indeed phosphorylated in vivo. The immediate sequence surrounding Ser337 in both mouse and human p50 is RRKSDLE, which can be detected by a PKA substrate antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated serine or threonine residues in the sequence Arg-Xaa-pSer/Thr (RX(pS/T)). To test the phosphorylation state of Ser337 in a cellular environment, p50 proteins were immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts of HeLa cells with anti-p50 antibody and analyzed by Western blotting with either the PKA substrate antibody (anti-RX(pS/T)) or anti-p50 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, Western blotting with the PKA substrate antibody revealed a 50-kDa protein (lane 1). The identity of this protein as authentic p50 was confirmed by anti-p50 Western blotting (lane 2). This finding provides evidence that p50 Ser337 can be phosphorylated in vivo. To confirm the ability of PKA to specifically phosphorylate residue Ser337 of p50, the purified PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma) was incubated with bacterially purified wild type or mutant p50 249-363 polypeptides in an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAc) could phosphorylate wild type p50 but not GST control protein (compare lanes 1 and 2). As expected, PKAc failed to phosphorylate both p50 S337A mutant and S337A/S342A double mutant, which lack the PKA site (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 5). Notably, the mutation of Ser342 to alanine alone was unable to disrupt phosphorylation on Ser337 by PKA (Fig. 6A, lane 4). These results prove definitively that Ser337 of p50 is a PKA kinase site and can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro. We next tested whether phosphorylation of Ser337 is critical for DNA binding. We incubated both wild type and mutant S337A full-length p50 proteins with PKA catalytic subunit in the in vitro kinase assay and examined how the phosphorylation of residue Ser337 affects p50 DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 6B, phosphorylation of Ser337 by PKA dramatically increased the ability of wild type p50 to bind DNA (compare lane 2 with lane 1). By contrast, p50 mutant S337A, which is unable to be phosphorylated by PKA, failed to bind DNA following PKA treatment (compare lane 4 with lane 3). In this study, we have identified three serine residues, Ser65, Ser337, and Ser342, that are critical for p50 DNA binding. A disruption of p50 dimerization ability is not the cause of the loss of DNA binding that results from individually mutating each of these serine residues. In particular, we have proved both in vitro and in vivo that p50 DNA binding is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 337. Our studies highlight how the function of NF-κB can be distinctively regulated by the specific phosphorylation of each of its subunits. Whereas phosphorylation of Ser337 on p50 regulates DNA binding by the p50 subunit, phosphorylation of Ser276, Ser529, and Ser536 on p65 regulates NF-κB transactivation (30Zhong H. SuYang H.

Recently, Ser276 of p65 was shown to be phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit present in the cytosolic NF-κB-IκB-PKAc complex upon degradation of IκB. The phosphorylation of Ser276 of p65 induces a conformational change that enhances the binding of CBP/p300 by weakening the interaction between the Rel homology domain and the C-terminal transactivation domain (10Zhong H. May M.J. Jimi E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 625-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 30Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ser337 in the Rel homology domain of p50 is the residue directly corresponding to Ser276 of p65, the only regulatory phosphoresidue in the Rel homology domain of p65. Specifically, the sequence surrounding p50 Ser337 (LRRKSDLE), which is the only serine residue of p50 fitting a consensus substrate site for PKA, is highly similar to that of p65 Ser276 (LRRPSDRE). Intriguingly, our preliminary findings also suggest that Ser337 of p50 and Ser276 of p65 may play similar and critical roles in DNA binding of the respective subunits, which raises the question of whether these two residues are co-regulated by a common enzyme. Although we have shown that Ser337 is a target for phosphorylation by PKA in vitro, making it highly probable that p50 is regulated by PKA, it should be noted that the sequence surrounding Ser337 also fits the profile of several other kinases such as CaMII, casein kinase II, and protein kinase G. Nonetheless, the conformational change induced by the phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 could be different from that induced by phosphorylation of p65 Ser276 because p50 lacks a transactivation domain. The crystal structures of DNA-bound NF-κB show that Ser337 is proximal to the hinge region linking the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of p50 (46Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Serine 337 resides on the outer surface of p50, making it easily accessible by kinases. Phosphorylation at this position is critical, as substitution of Ser337 with threonine fully retains p50 DNA binding, whereas merely substituting a negative charge at this position with aspartic acid disables p50 DNA binding. We speculate that phosphorylation of Ser337 enables DNA binding of p50 by inducing a conformational change in the hinge region of p50. Although it is evident that phosphorylation of Ser337 of p50 is critical for DNA binding, it is unclear why Ser65 and Ser342, the other two residues identified in this study, are important for DNA binding. Notably, neither of these two residues has a consensus site for a known kinase. In the case of Ser65, the crystal structures of the NF-κB DNA complex reveal that this residue is located on the DNA recognition loop of p50, which projects into the major groove of the DNA (Fig. 2). Although Ser65 itself does not make specific contacts with DNA, it is required to maintain the secondary structure of the DNA recognition loop by forming potentially crucial van der Waals contacts with residues Gly67 and Phe55 using the hydroxyl side chain. These contacts presumably become disrupted by the substitution of Ser65 with alanine, causing destabilization of the loop structure and loss of p50 DNA binding. By contrast, mutation of Ser65 to threonine preserves the van der Waals contacts with residues Gly67 and Phe55, thus maintaining the DNA recognition loop and the DNA binding ability of p50. The reason that mutation of Ser65 to aspartic acid failed to bind DNA is likely because it creates an additional hydrogen bond with Arg58, the residue that forms a specific DNA contact with a guanine. Taken together, our mutational results correlate perfectly with the predictions based on structural information, suggesting that Ser65 is sensitive to mutation because of its importance in maintaining the p50 DNA recognition loop rather than being potentially regulated by phosphorylation. In the case of Ser342, it is unclear why this residue is important for p50 DNA binding. Phosphorylation may not be involved, as substitution with threonine failed to retain p50 DNA binding, although it is known that some kinases, notably IKKs, strongly prefer serine over threonine (46Li J. Peet G.W. Pullen S.S. Schembri-King J. Warren T.C. Marcu K.B. Kehry M.R. Barton R. Jakes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30736-30741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition, despite their proximity, Ser342 is not involved in phosphorylation of Ser337, as phosphorylation of Ser337 by PKA was not disrupted by mutation of Ser342. In summary, it is intriguing to consider that Ser65 and Ser342 are important for DNA binding for reasons other than phosphorylation and that DNA binding of p50 is regulated solely by phosphorylation of Ser337. Future studies will identify the actual cellular p50 Ser337 kinase and the mechanism by which this phosphorylation affects NF-κB DNA binding. Control of DNA binding by phosphorylation of p50 Ser337 represents a novel mechanism, which adds to the complexity of NF-κB regulation that includes nuclear translocation and transactivation of p65. This finding has major biological implications, as p50 functions in the DNA binding of both the transactivator NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer and transrepressor p50/p50 homodimer and, therefore, has the potential to both positively and negatively modulate the transcription of NF-κB-controlled genes. It will be important to determine how the discovery of this new NF-κB mechanism contributes to understanding the development, physiology, and pathology of certain diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2117939120,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands are synthesized as type I membrane protein precursors exposed at the cell surface. Shedding of the ectodomain of these proteins is the way cells regulate the equilibrium between cell-associated and diffusible forms of these growth factors. Whereas the regulated shedding of transforming growth factor-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin precursors have been clearly established, regulation of full-length pro-EGF shedding has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, using both wild-type and M2 mutant CHO-K1 as well as HeLa cell lines transiently transfected with epitope-tagged rat pro-EGF expression plasmid, we demonstrate that these cells synthesize EGF as a high molecular weight membrane-associated precursor glycoprotein expressed at the cell surface. All cell lines are able to release the entire ectodomain of pro-EGF in the extracellular medium following juxtamembrane cleavage of the precursor once it is present at the cell surface. More significantly we clearly established that CHO-M2 and HeLa cells only constitutively release low levels of pro-EGF. This shedding is a regulated phenomenon in wild-type CHO cells where it can be induced by different agents such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), pervanadate, and serum but not by calcium ionophores. Using specific inhibitors as well as protein kinase C (PKC) depletion, PMA stimulation was shown to be completely dependent on PKC activation whereas pervanadate and serum stimulation were not. Regulated ectodomain shedding involves the activity of a zinc metalloprotease as determined by inhibition with phenantrolin and TAPI-2 and by the results obtained with the CHO-M2 shedding defective mutant cell line. Comparison of the ability of CHO and HeLa cell lines to shed pro-EGF and pro-TNF-α upon stimulation greatly suggests that TACE (ADAM 17) may not be the ectoprotease involved in the secretion of pro-EGF ectodomain and that this protease, which remains to be identified, shows a restricted cellular expression pattern. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands are synthesized as type I membrane protein precursors exposed at the cell surface. Shedding of the ectodomain of these proteins is the way cells regulate the equilibrium between cell-associated and diffusible forms of these growth factors. Whereas the regulated shedding of transforming growth factor-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin precursors have been clearly established, regulation of full-length pro-EGF shedding has not been clearly demonstrated. Here, using both wild-type and M2 mutant CHO-K1 as well as HeLa cell lines transiently transfected with epitope-tagged rat pro-EGF expression plasmid, we demonstrate that these cells synthesize EGF as a high molecular weight membrane-associated precursor glycoprotein expressed at the cell surface.

This growth factor is now known to be part of a family of growth factors that includes transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) (2Derynck R. Adv.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These growth factors share the ability to bind the same receptor, i.e. the EGF receptor (EGFR) and activate its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that induces cellular differentiation and mitogenic effects (7Carpenter G.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 453-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Most growth factors are produced as soluble inactive precursors that are activated by proteolysis in vesicular compartments of the secretory pathway before being released in the extracellular medium. Both cDNA and protein structure analysis clearly indicate that EGFR ligands are also derived from precursor molecules (9Massagué J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 515-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). However, they are not synthesized as soluble but as nondiffusible, glycosylated membrane-associated precursors exposed at the cell surface. In the case of EGF, the cDNA analysis from human, mouse, and rat species predicted very large precursor molecules (respectively 1207, 1217, and 1133 amino acids) (10Scott J. Urdea M.

These precursor molecules are predicted to be type I membrane proteins. In the case of rat pro-EGF, the 1035 N-terminal amino acids constitute the extracellular domain that includes the EGF sequence in the juxtamembrane region and eight additional “EGF-like” modules, a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal intracellular part of 76 amino acids (13Saggi S.S.J. Safirstein R. Price P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The biological importance of EGFR ligands underscores the interest in the study of the enzymatic processing leading to growth factor bioavailability (14Fisher D.A. Salido A.C. Barajas L. Annu. Rev.

However, the cellular events leading from the high molecular weight precursor molecule to secretion of lower molecular weight soluble EGF into the external fluid are currently not clearly identified. Recent evidence suggests that proteolytic cleavage of cell surface proteins, i.e. ectodomain shedding, is an important mechanism whereby cells regulate the repertoire of proteins expressed on their surface, shifting molecular species from their membrane-bound forms to soluble ones with the potential modification of their biological properties (9Massagué J.

With the important exception of the β-secretase activity (an aspartylprotease) that sheds the prodomain of the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) from the cell surface, cell surface proteolysis appears to be mediated by members of the metzincin superfamily of zinc-dependent proteases that include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ADAMs (for A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase) (24Peschon J.J.

Unfortunately, the information concerning pro-EGF maturation and secretion does appear much more controversial. In rodents submaxillary glands, the precursor molecule is not detectable and only the mature and diffusible 6 kDa form of EGF accumulates in the secretory granules of the regulated exocrine secretory pathway (12Rall L.B.

Cell Sci. 1985; 3: 19-28Crossref Google Scholar). In this case, the release of EGF in the biological fluid (saliva) involves exocytosis, i.e. fusion of the secretory granule membrane with the apical cellular membrane. This phenomenon is highly regulated and may be achieved at least through the activation of adrenergic receptors (34Byyny R.L. Orth D.N. Cohen S. Doyne E.S.

The presence of EGF-containing peptides of varying molecular masses (from 6 to 160 kDa) in urine (37Lakshmanan J. Salido E.C. Lam R. Barajas L. Fisher D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 1990; 259: 1056-1061PubMed Google Scholar) of different species indicates that EGF can be released (shed) from its membrane-anchored precursor. This occurs through proteolytic cleavage in the juxtamembrane region. The full-length precursor was the major substrate for shedding, leading to the initial release of the entire ectodomain. In order to lead to the ultimate, mature 6-kDa form of the molecule, the ectodomain needs to be further maturated in the extracellular medium. It has already been shown that, in vitro, mature EGF could be released from its precursor through the action of different type of proteases; acidic protease such as pepsin (36Breyer J.A. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16565-16570Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) or serine-proteases such as trypsin (22Schaudies R.P. Grimes J. Wray H.G. Koldovsky O. Am. J.

Based on its sensitivity to a set of inhibitors, it was shown to belong to the serine-protease family. This experimental evidence is in conflict with results obtained in two independent studies performed with cultured cells. In these cells transfected either with a full-length (48Dempsey P.J. Meise K.S. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Coffey R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or truncated (49Dong J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) human pro-EGF cDNA, EGF release was sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors (batimastat and BB-2116) and cation chelators (EDTA and EGTA) and insensitive to non-metalloprotease inhibitors (48Dempsey P.J. Meise K.S. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Coffey R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Another important feature concerning EGFR ligand shedding is its potential regulation. It is now clearly established that secretion of TGF-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin are regulated phenomena that can be triggered by PMA (through PKC activation), calcium ionophore (calcium influx), serum or pervanadate (tyrosine phosphatase inhibition) (9Massagué J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning EGF, its regulated shedding from cell surface is not so clearly established. Dempsey et al. (48Dempsey P.J. Meise K.S. Yoshitake Y. Nishikawa K. Coffey R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) working with MDCK cells transfected with the full-length human pro-EGF cDNA failed to stimulate EGF secretion with serum or PMA whereas Dong and Wiley (49Dong J. Wiley H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 557-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) working with mammary cells (HB2) transfected with a prodomain-truncated human pro-EGF cDNA also failed to stimulate secretion with PMA but observed a stimulation of EGF release with both calcium ionophore and a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor. From these studies, it appears that important discrepancies exist in the conclusions that can be drawn from the studies on pro-EGF shedding compared with other EGFR ligands. In order to provide insights into pro-EGF shedding properties, we decided to study pro-EGF secretion in CHO-K1 (both wild type and M2 mutant) and HeLa cell lines transiently transfected with a full-length rat pro-EGF cDNA. The CHO-K1 cellular model has been used previously to establish the mechanism of regulation of the secretion of other EGFR ligands (TGF-α, HB-EGF), and HeLa cells have also been used to study the shedding of various proteins including HB-EGF (54Davis-Fleische K.M. Brigstock D.R. Besner G.E. Growth Factors. 2001; 19: 127-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 55Nishi E. Prat A. Hospita l V. Elenius K. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have been able to demonstrate that once pro-EGF is exposed at the cell surface, it can be shed to release its entire ectodomain in the extracellular medium. In CHO-K1, this ectodomain shedding can be stimulated by PMA, serum, or pervanadate. PMA acts through a PKC-dependent pathway whereas serum and pervanadate act through PKC-independent pathway(s). The use of specific protease inhibitors as well as of the CHO-M2 mutant cell line that displays impaired constitutive and regulated pro-EGF ectodomain shedding demonstrated that shedding was achieved through the activation of a zinc-dependent metalloprotease activity. More important is the fact that, whereas the zinc-dependent metalloprotease ADAM 17 (TACE) has an important role in the regulation of EGFR ligands shedding such as TGF-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin (24Peschon J.J.

Kidney RNAs were first subjected to reverse transcription using random priming and Expand™ Reverse Transcriptase as described by the manufacturer's protocol. PCR amplification of the cDNA was performed according to rat pro-EGF cDNA sequence as published by Saggi et al. (Ref. 13Saggi S.S.J. Safirstein R. Price P.M.

Hallmarks of ASIC1α are gating by external protons and rapid desensitization. In sensory neurons ASIC1 may constitute a nociceptor for pain induced by local acidification, whereas in central neurons it may modulate synaptic activity. To gain insight into the functional roles of ASIC1, we cloned and examined the properties of the evolutionarily distant species toadfish (Opsanus tau), ∼420-million year divergent from mammals.

The regions of highest conservation are the second transmembrane domain and the ectodomain, whereas the amino and carboxyl termini and first transmembrane domain are poorly conserved. At the functional level, fish ASIC1 is gated by external protons with a half-maximal activation at pH o 5.6 and a half-maximal inactivation at pH o 7.30. The fish differs from the rat channel on having a 25-fold faster rate of desensitization. Functional studies of chimeras made from rat and fish ASIC1 indicate that the extracellular domain specifically, a cluster of three residues, confers the faster desensitization rate to the fish ASIC1.

The ASIC1α protein (or BNaC2a) is the most abundant of all mammalian proton-gated ion channels and the one that is expressed in most neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (1Alvarez de la Rosa D.

Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The mammalian ASIC1, ASIC2, and ASIC3 are all activated by protons but the degree and rate of desensitization markedly differ in each type of channel. For instance, rat ASIC1 and ASIC3 exhibit rapid and complete desensitization at pH o 5.0, whereas ASIC2 has a slow and incomplete desensitization, leaving a substantial component of persistent current in the continual presence of protons (29Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of the functional differences in the currents generated by the ASICs can be attributed to differences in desensitization rate, suggesting that this property may be important in conferring specificity to the response of the various ASICs in different regions of the nervous system. Numerous functions have been proposed for ASIC1 including a role in sensory transduction, specifically in nociception (pain induced by ischemia and inflammation) (7Benson C.J. Sutherland S.P. Ann. N.

For many of these functions, in particular nociception, proton sensitivity plays a fundamental role in the physiology of these channels. In order to gain more insight in the structure-function of these channels, we cloned and examined the functional properties of ASIC1 from an evolutionarily distant species, the fish Opsanus tau. Comparison of the properties of the fish and mammalian ASIC1 revealed significant differences, primarily Ca2+ dependence for activation and faster desensitization rate of the fish ASIC1. To identify the structural determinants of the desensitization process, we constructed a series of chimeras with the cDNAs of fish and rat and expressed them in Xenopus laevis oocytes for functional analysis with the two-electrode voltage clamp and patch clamp techniques. Cloning of Fish ASIC1 cDNA—Poly(A)+ was extracted from brain and spinal cord of toadfish using oligo(dT)-cellulose and proteinase K (Roche Applied Science) as described (8Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1994; 367: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1739) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using oligo(dT) primers and SuperDNA reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). We designed degenerated primers from highly conserved sequences among all the mammalian ASIC proteins. We selected the protein sequence NCNCRMVHMPG to make the sense primer: AA(C/T)TG(C/T)AG(A/G)ATGGTICA(C/T)ATGCCIGG. The antisense primer was designed from the protein sequence GDIGGQMG: CCCAT(C/T)TGICCICCIAT(A/G)TCICC, where I indicates inosine. The position of the primers is indicated in Fig. 1. PCR was performed on first strand cDNA with Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science) with the following parameters: denaturing for 20 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 55 °C, and extension for 30 s at 72 °C, repeated for 30 cycles. The PCR product was sequenced and used to design specific primers for 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends performed with 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA end system kits (Roche Applied Science) according to the protocols provided by the supplier. Once the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences were obtained, we designed a new set of oligonucleotides to amplify the whole DNA coding sequence using high fidelity Taq plus Tgo polymerases (Roche Applied Science). To the antisense 3′ primer was added the sequence of the HA epitope, such that translation of the final cDNA produced a protein with the HA epitope in the carboxyl terminus. The PCR product was subcloned in pCR.2 vector (Invitrogen). Several clones were sequenced with an automatic DNA sequencer at the Keck Facility at Yale University. Construction of Rat and Fish ASIC Chimeras and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Fish and rat ASIC1 chimeras were made by PCR using hybrid primers and a combination of Taq and Tgo DNA polymerases (Roche Applied Science) as described (14Fyfe G.F. Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36415-36421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Constructs were subcloned in pCDNA-3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutageneses of cDNAs were performed with the QuickExchange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). All constructs underwent DNA sequencing at the Keck Facility of Yale University prior to further use. Synthesis of cRNA and Injection of X. laevis Oocytes—cRNAs were synthesized with T7 RNA polymerase from linearized plasmids containing the entire coding sequence of the genes using mMESSAGEmMA-CHINE (Ambion). Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 2 ng of cRNA from rASIC1, fASIC1 or each of the chimeras. Oocytes were incubated in frog Ringer: 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 for 2–3 days at 19 °C before making recordings. Prior to patching, oocytes were placed in an hyperosmotic solution: 220 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 220 mm aspartic acid, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH) to remove the vitelline membrane with fine forceps. Single-channel Recordings—Unitary currents were recorded using the outside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique. Channels were activated by rapidly moving squared glass tubes (inner diameter 0.7 mm) delivering solutions of desired pH o values in front of the tip of the patch pipette. The delivery device achieves complete solution changes within 20 ms (SF-77B; Perfusion Fast-Step, Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (LG16; Dagan Corp.) using a micropipette puller (PP-83, Narishige; Scientific Instrument Laboratory) and fire-polished to a final tip diameter of 1 μm. When pipettes were filled with solutions, the resistance was 5–10 megaohms. Single channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch-200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) using a DigiData 1200 series interface and pClamp 8.3 software, both from Axon Instruments. Data were recorded at 10 kHz, filtered at 5 kHz, and stored on a computer hard disc for analysis. For display, data were filtered with a digital Gaussian filter to 0.5 kHz. Pipette solution (intracellular) was as follows: 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm HEPES, adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH. Solution in the recording microchamber (extracellular) was as follows: 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm MES-Tris, adjusted to pH 7.4. The tip of the patch pipette was perfused with solutions of composition identical to the extracellular bath but buffered at pH 6.0, 5.0, 4.0 or as indicated in the experiment. To examine the effects of Ca2+, this ion was added only to the external solution in concentrations indicated in the particular experiments. Whole-cell Recordings of Oocytes with a Two-microelectrode Voltage Clamp (TEVC)—Current and voltage electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass and filled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of electrodes was kept in the range of 0.5–1 megaohms. Currents were recorded with an Oocyte clamp, OC-725B (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and digitized with a sampling rate of 100 Hz (PowerLab/200, ADInstruments Pty Ltd.), and the data were stored in the hard disk of a PC. The oocyte chamber (volume of 200 μl), modified for rapid exchange of solutions, was perfused at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min. The chamber was equipped with a temperature sensor to report the temperature of the solutions in the chamber. To examine the apparent Ca2+ affinity, the external solution contained the following: 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, buffered at pH o 7.6 (precondition) or 5.0 (activation) and various concentrations of Ca2+ as indicated in the experiments. Experiments were carried out at room temperature unless indicated. Data Analysis and Statistics—Peak current values from whole-cell currents were used to calculate the half-maximal activation and inhibition for H+, Na+, Ca2+, and amiloride according to the equation: I = 1/1 + (KD /[T]) n , where [T] represents the external concentration of H+ or Ca2+, KD is the apparent half-maximal activation for the corresponding ion, and n is the Hill coefficient. Data points are the mean ± S.D. of at least four independent experiments; n is given in the figure legend for each experiment. Desensitization rates were calculated by fitting the sum of unitary currents of 10–25 patches to a single exponential: M 0 + M 1·e–λt, where M 1 represents the component of the current that inactivates with the rate constant λ (s–1), and M 0 is a constant that accounts for the offset of the current. Cloning of ASIC1 cDNAs from Toadfish—To clone the fish ASIC1, we identified highly conserved sequences among all of the mammalian ASIC proteins cloned to date. We designed two degenerated primers corresponding to the amino acid sequences NCNCRMVHMPG (sense) and GDIGGQMG (reverse) that are highly conserved. These primers were used to amplify a 360-base pair fragment from single strand cDNA synthesized from poly(A)+ extracted from adult toadfish brain and spinal cord. The DNA sequence of the PCR product indicated that it corresponded to the fish ASIC1 gene. The complete coding sequence of the cDNA was then obtained using 5′ and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 1 shows an alignment of rat (26Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar) and fish ASIC proteins. The two proteins exhibit 76% amino acid identity. The domains of highest homology are M2 (90.6%) and the ectodomain (82.4%), whereas the cytoplasmic amino terminus (53.3%), carboxyl terminus (58.2%), and M1 (59.4%) are more divergent. Functional Expression of Fish ASIC1 in Xenopus Oocytes— Fish ASIC1 cRNA was injected in Xenopus oocytes, and proton-activated currents were measured 2 days after injection with the two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Fig. 2A shows representative whole-cell inward currents elicited by a change in pH o from 7.4 to 5.0. The current has a rapid onset of activation and desensitizes rapidly in the presence of protons. After electrophysiological measurements, the same oocytes were homogenized and treated for Western blotting. The fASIC1 protein was revealed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody. A protein of 65 kDa was identified in injected oocytes but not in controls (Fig. 2B). Unitary Currents of Fish ASIC—We then examined the properties of unitary currents of fish ASIC1 expressed in X. oocytes with the patch-clamp technique in the outside-out configuration. Channels were activated by a rapid change of external pH o from 7.4 to 5.0. Fig. 3A shows representative examples of fASIC1 recorded in symmetrical 150 mm Na+. For comparison, Fig. 3B shows traces from rASIC1 obtained under identical experimental conditions. The spikes in the initial part of the records represent noise introduced by the perfusion system when the solutions are changed. After a brief delay, fASIC1 channels open almost synchronously, followed by rapid and progressive closure in the continual presence of external protons. The records reveal uniform amplitude of the fish unitary currents in contrast to the rASIC1, which exhibits subconductance states in addition to the fully open channel. Subconductances are prominent at the end of the bursts of activity in the middle and lower traces from Fig. 3B (21Price M.P. McIIwrath S.L. Xie J. Cheng C. Qiao J. Tarr D.E. Sluka K.A. Brennan T.J. Lewin G.R. Welsh M.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1071-1083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). There are also significant differences in channel kinetics. Whereas the open state of fASIC1 is rarely interrupted by closures, rASIC1 exhibits complex kinetics with multiple brief openings and closures throughout the burst of activity that confer a flickering appearance to the traces. Another significant difference between these channels is the shorter duration of the bursts of activity of the fish than the rat channels. Notice the 20-fold difference in the time scales in Fig. 4, A and B. This finding indicates that the desensitization rate of fish is faster than rASIC1. Desensitization rate constants were determined from the sum of 12 independent patch clamp records from fASIC1 or rASIC1. The continuous lines in Fig. 4 represent the fit of the data with a single exponential. The calculated desensitization rate constants were 56 and 2.0 s–1 for the fish and rat, respectively. Properties of fASIC1: Apparent Affinity for Proton Activation and Desensitization, Single Channel Conductance, Ion Selectivity, Amiloride Block, and Temperature Sensitivity—To determine the affinity of fASIC1 for external protons, we calculated the apparent half-maximal activation from peak whole-cell currents elicited by progressively lowering the pH o using TEVC. The protocol consisted of 30-s perfusion with preconditioning pH o of 7.4 before the external solution was changed to each of the test solutions. Peak currents were normalized to the maximal value obtained with a pH o of 4.0. The line in Fig. 5A represents the fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with calculated half-maximal proton activation pHA50 of 5.6 ± 0.4. The effect of preconditioning pH o was assessed by measuring peak currents induced by changes in solutions from a series of preconditioning pH o values to a solution of pH o of 5.5 (Fig. 5B). The dependence of desensitization on proton concentration, pHD50, was calculated to be 7.36. The steep slope of the curve indicates that desensitization takes place by a cooperative process. The conductance of fASIC1 unitary currents were determined from I-V curves recorded in the presence of 150 mm Na+ or 150 mm Li+ and with 1 mm Ca2+ only in the external solutions. Fig. 5C shows linear I-V relations as predicted by the voltage-independent behavior of the ASIC family of ion channels. Currents were of larger magnitude in the presence of Na+ than in Li+. The cord conductance, calculated in the voltage range of –20 to –120 mV, was 29 and 20 picosiemens for Na+ in Li+, respectively. In the presence of K+, the unitary currents were much smaller than in Na+, and when Ca2+ was the only external cation, the amplitudes were too small to be discernible as individual transitions (not shown). A characteristic of the ENaC/DEG channels is the block by amiloride or its analogues. The half-maximal concentration for inhibition of fASIC1 was calculated by measuring peak currents induced by a change in pH o from 7.4 to 5.5 in the presence of increasing concentrations of external amiloride. The calculated KD was 9.6 μm, and the Hill coefficient was 0.9 (Fig. 5D). The apparent affinity for external Na+ was estimated by measuring peak currents induced by pH o 5.0 in the presence of increasing concentrations of external Na+ from 30 to 300 mm. The osmolarity of the solutions was kept constant, 600 mOsm, by the addition of mannitol. The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation with a KD value of 118 mm (Fig. 5E). A previous report indicated that low temperature slows the rate of desensitization of the mammalian ASIC1 (2Alvarez de La Rosa D.A. Krueger S.R. Kolar A. Shao D. Fitzsimonds R.M. Canessa C.M. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this property could modulate the activity of the ASICs in peripheral terminals where the temperature is a few degrees lower than in the central nervous system. In contrast to mammals, the body temperature of fishes is lower, and it fluctuates over a much larger range than in mammals, making possible modulation of the activity of fASIC1 not only in the periphery but also in the central nervous system. We therefore investigated whether the activity of fASIC1 is sensitive to changes in temperature. Fig. 5F shows traces of whole-cell currents activated by pH o 5.0 at 22 or 6 °C, which is the normal range of temperatures experienced by most marine fishes. Peak currents and the rate of desensitization did not differ significantly at 22 or 6 °C. External Ca2 + Is Required for Proton Activation of fASIC1— External Ca2+ has been implicated in the modulation of the rat ASIC1 (10Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 19Kellenberger S. Schild L.

Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of external Ca2+ on the activity of fASIC1 by first measuring whole cell currents with 1 mm external Ca2+ or nominal free Ca2+ (no EDTA added). Fig. 6A shows records of fASIC1 whole-cell currents activated by a change in pH o from 7.4 to 5.0 with 1 mm or without Ca2+. The concentration of external Ca2+ and the pH o are indicated above the current traces. In the initial part of the experiment, the oocyte was perfused with 1 mm Ca2+ in the preconditioning (pH o 7.4) and activating (pH o 5.0) solutions. A robust response was elicited, which was considered to be the maximal response. The second trial shows a similar experiment but without Ca2+ in the solutions. Here, pH o 5.0 failed to activate fASIC1. When the preconditioning solution had 1 mm Ca2+ and the activating solution had 0 mm Ca2+, a current of ∼80% of the maximal response was elicited. Finally, if the preconditioning solution did not contain Ca2+ and the activating solution had 1 mm Ca2+, the current was ∼20% of the maximal response. The results were reproduced independently of the sequence on which the four different pairs of solutions were applied. These experiments indicate that Ca2+ must be bound to the channel prior to the arrival of protons in order to achieve maximal activation. The apparent affinity for external Ca2+ was estimated by measuring whole-cell currents elicited by pH o 5.0 solutions with increasing concentrations of Ca2+. For each tested Ca2+ concentration, the preconditioning and the activating solutions contained the same amount of Ca2+. Fig. 6B shows a plot of normalized peak currents, with the line representing the fit of the data with half-maximal activation constant of 3 mm and Hill coefficient of 1.9. We also observed that when the concentration of Ca2+ was increased above 1 mm, the activity of fASIC1 decreased progressively, but it was not completely abolished even when external Ca2+ concentration was raised to 60 mm. To investigate the nature of Ca2+-induced inhibition, we examined the effects of increasing Ca2+ concentrations on the unitary currents. Outside-out patches were perfused with pH o 5.0 solutions containing 150 mm Na+ and increasing concentrations of Ca2+. Representative examples in Fig. 6C show a progressive decrease in the amplitude of the unitary currents. A plot of the magnitude of normalized unitary currents to 0 mm external Ca2+ is shown in Fig. 6D, where the line represents the fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation with values for KD of 16 mm and n of 1.3. Determinants of the Kinetics of Desensitization of ASIC1— One of the main functional differences between fish and rat ASIC1 is the rate of desensitization. Since these two channels exhibit a high degree of amino acid conservation, we thought that it would be possible to identify the sequences conferring this property by swapping domains between the fish and rat ASIC1. First we examined the contribution of the five defined structural domains of ASIC1: amino terminus and carboxyl terminus, M1 and M2, and the ectodomain. Fig. 7 shows a schematic representation of the first set of chimeras, where shown in white are sequences from fish ASIC1, in black are sequences from rat ASIC1, and in gray are sequences from rASIC2. The numbers under the chimeras indicate the amino acids in the protein sequence corresponding to the rat or fish ASIC. The cRNA of each chimera was injected in oocytes, and whole-cell and unitary currents were examined. The seven chimeras were functional when expressed in oocytes. The rate of desensitization (λD s–1) was measured from currents elicited by pH o 5.0 and 1 mm Ca2+. CH1 and CH2 were designed to test the contribution of the transmembrane domains. These chimeras desensitized at the rates corresponding to fish and rat ASIC1, indicating that the transmembrane domains do not influence the λD. CH3 and CH4 were designed to test the contribution of the amino and carboxyl termini. These chimeras exhibited desensitization rates of the fish and rat ASIC1, respectively, indicating that the intracellular domains of the channel do not contribute significantly to desensitization. Finally, swapping only the extracellular domains, CH5 and CH6, reproduced the desensitization rates of fish and rat ASIC1, respectively. We confirmed the importance of the extracellular domain by making CH7, which contains M1, M2, and amino and carboxyl termini from the rapid desensitizing fish ASIC1 (λD 56 s–1) and the ectodomain from rASIC2, which desensitizes very slowly and incompletely (λD <0.02 s–1) (20Mamet J. Baron A. Lazdunski M. Voilley N. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10662-10670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CH7 exhibited a slow and incomplete desensitization rate, indistinguishable from wild-type rASIC2, confirming the crucial role of the ectodomain in determining λD. Fig. 7B shows representative examples of patch recordings of the three chimeras, where the whole ectodomain has been exchanged. To define further the regions in the extracellular domain important for desensitization, we made additional chimeras, swapping shorter segments of the ectodomain, CH8 to CH15 (Fig. 8). CH8, which contained the carboxyl terminal half of the ectodomain from rats, exhibited a fast λD of 24 s–1, whereas CH9, which contained the amino terminal half of the ectodomain from rats, exhibited a much slower λD of 5.0 s–1. This result indicates that the first half of the ectodomain of fish confers the faster λD. CH10 (λD of 20 s–1) and CH11 (λD of 4.4 s–1) maintained the same properties as the previous two chimeras; therefore, the segment comprised between amino acids 76 and 130 is important to determine the λD. Additional chimeras, CH12 to CH15, confirmed this observation. Fig. 8B shows representative examples of the most informative chimeras. A sequence comparison of the segment comprised by amino acids 76–130 from rat and fish is shown in Fig. 9A. Boxes surround nonconserved residues. We exchanged the nonconserved residues in the rat ASIC1 to generate rASIC-PLM and rASIC-HLVE mutants. The rASIC1-PLM channel exhibited a desensitization rate of 23.1 s–1, much faster than the wild type rASIC1, whereas the mutant rASIC-HLVE had a desensitization rate no different from wild type. Conversely, substitution of the corresponding residues from rat into fASIC1, fASIC1-SQL, resulted in a significant reduction of λd (4.6 s–1). Thus, substitution of three residues in the extracellular domain of the rat channel for the corresponding ones in fish is sufficient to induce a fast desensitization. However, single amino acid mutations produce only small changes in λD, indicating that the desensitization rate depends on the synergistic effect of the three residues. Structural and Functional Comparison of Fish and Rat ASIC1—Comparison of the sequences of fish and rat ASIC1 reveals 76% overall identity at the amino acid level. Most of the differences are confined to M1 and the cytoplasmic domains, whereas M2 and the ectodomain are highly conserved (27Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lingueglia E. De Weille J.R. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We found that the pore properties of the channels from the two species are identical: ion selectivity (Na+ > Li+ > K+ [tmt] Ca2+), single channel conductance (29 and 30 picosiemens for fish and rat), and amiloride block (Ki of 9.4 and 10 μm for fish and rat) (29Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These functional results together with the highly conserved sequence of M2 support the view that M2 forms the ion pathway (17Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gatschi I. Scheeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kellenberger S. Auberson M. Gatschi I. Scheeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Although the region preceding M1 has also been implicated in ion permeation (11Coscoy S. De Weille J.R. Lingueglia E. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10129-10132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we found little correlation of the poorly conserved amino termini with the pore properties. The other region that exhibits a high degree of identity is the extracellular domain (82.4%). Sequence conservation of extracellular domains is not a characteristic of all members of the ENaC/DEG family. For instance, the subunits of ENaC from rat and frog share only ∼42% identity, although the functional properties of ENaC from these two species are indistinguishable (22Puoti A. May A. Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Schild L. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C188-C197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the high degree of conservation of the ectodomain suggests that it is particularly important in the ASIC family. Indeed, this domain has been implicated in the gating mechanism by binding external protons and Ca2+ (13De Weille J. Bassilana F. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Immke D.C. McCleskey E.W. Neuron. 2003; 37: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 29Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our results show that fASIC1 is activated by protons with an apparent pH50 of 5.6, similar to the mammalian ASIC1 (29Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but in contrast to the rASIC1, the fish channel requires more external Ca2+ for activation (KD of 3 mm). Another important difference between the fish and mammalian channels is the desensitization rate. Desensitization is a process that occurs in most ligand-gated channels. The rate and extent of desensitization are important properties that shape the amplitude, duration, and frequency of the channel response. A 25-fold faster desensitization rate implies that for the same drop in pH o , the amount of charge entering into fish neurons is significantly smaller than in mammalian neurons. The consequences of this effect on the physiology of ASIC1 in the nervous system are not apparent with our current state of understanding of these channels. However, in the last few years, it has been shown that a host of different substances and conditions modulate the rate and extent of desensitization of the mammalian ASICs: external protons (29Zhang P. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 553-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), Ca2+ (13De Weille J. Bassilana F.

Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6459-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, nothing is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the desensitization of ASIC1 or the structural domains that participate in the process. To gain insight into these questions, we took advantage of the differences in desensitization rates between fish and mammalian ASIC1 to identify structural determinants that influence λD. Our results derived from functional analysis of many chimeras indicate that the extracellular domain determines the rate of desensitization of ASIC1. Further dissection of this domain led us to identify a short sequence constituted by three residues (Ser83-Gln84-Leu85 in rat and Pro83-Leu84-Met85 in fish) that is responsible for most of the difference in λD observed in rat and fish ASIC1. The full effect of the three residues was not reproduced by single mutations in any of the three positions, but together they had a synergistic effect. The effect was specific, because swapping of other amino acids in the same region, the quadruple mutations, QMAD131 for HLVE131, or the single mutation, Glu96 → Ser did not alter desensitization (not shown). We did not substitute all of the different amino acids in the segment comprised by residues 76–130, because the effect of the triple mutant R-PLM increased the λD from 2.2 to 20 s–1 to the same degree as the swapping of the whole segment (CH10 and CH13 λD of 20 and 17.1 s–1, respectively). Most importantly, other properties of the channels were not affected, such as the pH50 of activation or rate of recovery from desensitization (data not shown). The mechanism underlying the changes in λD cannot be determined by our data; however, we can speculate that these amino acids may mediate a conformational change that determines the transition from the open to the desensitized state (hinge hypothesis). Alternatively, in the open state, these residues may come in contact with another region of the protein such that the interaction stabilizes the open state and slows the desensitization rate. On the contrary, if the interaction destabilizes the open state, the desensitization rate becomes faster (interface hypothesis). Although the triad of amino acids we have identified is important, there are additional residues in the ectodomain that influence the rate of desensitization, because substitution of these residues did not completely restore the λD to the value of the wild-type channels. An additional important conclusion from these experiments is that activation and desensitization are independent processes, because variations in λD did not change the apparent pH50 of activation in wild type fish and rat ASIC1 or in the chimeras. In summary, functional analysis of two evolutionarily distant ASIC1 proteins has provided the first evidence that the ectodomain, in particular a short sequence of three residues, determines the desensitization process of ASIC1."

This novel antiangiogenic molecule is more effective in vivo than parent anginex. In a mouse xenograft model for ovarian carcinoma, 6DBF7 is observed to reduce tumor growth by up to 80%.

Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation, is key to normal organ development as well as to various pathological disorders like cancer, arthritis, diabetic retinopathy, and restenosis (1Griffioen A.W. van der Schaft D.W.

The use of agents that can inhibit angiogenesis, particularly in anti-tumor research (e.g. Refs. 2O'Reilly M.S. Boehm T. Shing Y. Fukai N. Vasios G. Lane W.S. Flynn E. Birkhead J.R. Olsen B.R.

Nature. 1997; 390: 404-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), has indicated that antiangiogenic therapy can be a promising therapeutic modality in the future. To date, the search for angiogenesis inhibitors has been focused on controlling two of the processes that promote angiogenesis: endothelial cell (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; DBF, dibenzofuran; HUVEC, human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; BCE, bovine capillary endothelial cell; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. growth and EC adhesion (4Molema G.

Targeting ECs as an anti-tumor treatment is attractive primarily because ECs are more accessible than are other cells to pharmacologic agents delivered via the blood, and ECs are genetically stable and are not easily mutated into drug-resistant variants. Most antiangiogenic agents have been discovered by identifying endogenous molecules (primarily proteins) that inhibit EC growth. This traditional approach has produced a number of antiangiogenics, such as platelet factor-4 (6Gupta S.K. Singh J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1121-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), thrombospondin (7Tolsma S.S. Volpert O.V. Good D.J. Frazier W.A. Polverini P.J. Bouck N. J.

Haseman J.R. Mayo K.H. Griffioen A.W. Blood. 2000; 96: 176-181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous angiostatic compounds have been identified, many of which are currently in various phases of clinical cancer trials (cancertrials.nci.nih.gov). Although a number of compounds have shown promise in the clinic, no major break-throughs have been reported using antiangiogenic agents as stand-alone therapies. This underscores the need for more and better angiostatic compounds for use as stand-alone therapies or in combination with conventional therapies. Moreover, some angiogenesis inhibitors have been shown to be ineffective or to cause diverse and multiple unwanted biological side effects (12Chen H. Herndon M.E. Lawler J. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 597-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This latter phenomenon was, to some extent, expected as many of these endogenous angiostatic proteins are pleiotropic; i.e. they are involved in several biological processes. Often these functions are found to arise from separate sites on the molecule and thus can be separated using smaller segments or domains of a given protein (13Dings, R. P. M., Nesmelova, I., Griffioen, A. W., and Mayo, K. H. (2003) Angiogenesis, in pressGoogle Scholar). This relates to the search for new antiangiogenic agents, which is aimed at improving specificity, reducing the therapeutic dosage, and minimizing molecular size with a small molecule antiangiogenic agent or antiangiogenic protein mimetic. This is one of the main goals among structural biologists and pharmaceutical chemists working to produce novel antiangiogenic agents. For the design of small molecule mimetics of antiangiogenic proteins, the identification of specific, functionally key amino acid residues and their spatial relationships is crucial. Nevertheless, structure-activity relationships for antiangiogenic proteins are sorely needed, and even the analysis of high-resolution molecular structures of a number of antiangiogenic proteins, e.g. endostatin (14Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), platelet factor-4 (15Mayo K.H. Roongta V. Ilyina E. Milius R. Barker S. Quinlan C. La Rosa G.

Science. 1997; 276: 1861-1864Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has yet to provide this information. Recently, we reported the design of the anginex peptide, a cytokine-like β-sheet-forming peptide 33-mer (17Mayo K.H. van der Schaft D.W. Griffioen A.W.

Anginex is more effective at inhibiting EC growth than platelet factor-4 and several other well known angiogenesis inhibitors such as angiostatin, endostatin, AGM-1470, and thrombospondin-1 (1Griffioen A.W. van der Schaft D.W.

This peptide 33-mer acts by specifically blocking adhesion and migration of angiogenically activated ECs, leading to apoptosis and ultimately to inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and inhibition of human tumor growth by up to ∼80% in various models (18Dings R.P.

Here we report for the first time the design of a partial peptide mimetic of anginex that was based on the identification of functionally key residues and the conformation responsible for the antiangiogenic activity of anginex. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized using a Milligen/Biosearch 9600 peptide solid-phase synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry. Lyophilized crude peptides were purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column with an elution gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The purity and composition of the peptides were verified by HPLC (Beckman Model 6300) analysis of amino acid composition of hydrolysates prepared by treating the peptides under argon in 6 n HCl for 24 h at 110 °C. The amino acid sequences of peptides were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. Synthesis of DBF Analogs—Unexceptional phases of solid-phase peptide synthesis were carried out on an ABI 431 peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using Fmoc methodology and (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole as coupling reagents. Fmoc-DBF-CO2H was prepared by slight modification of the reported method (22Bekele H. Nesloney C.L. McWilliams K.W. Zacharias N.M. Chitnumsub P. Kelly J.W. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 2259-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this nine-step synthesis, the intermediates and final product were characterized by TLC and 1H NMR with GC-low resolution mass spectrometry, 13C NMR, melting point, and IR being used as appropriate. Coupling of Fmoc-DBF-CO2H to Ile20 as well as of Leu11 to the peptide-DBF-NH2 was performed on the synthesizer. Coupling of Fmoc-Lys10-CO2H to the peptide-DBF-Leu11-NH2 sequence was difficult and required manual solid-phase peptide synthesis using the more reactive HATU reagent (N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-ylmethylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide with a molecular weight of 380) (23Carpino L.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 4397-4398Crossref Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The remaining couplings required for production of 2DBF7 through 11DBF7 were carried out using (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate/N-hydroxybenzotriazole conditions on the peptide synthesizer. After the final Fmoc deprotection, each of the DBF peptides was released from the resin with simultaneous removal of all acidolyzable trityl and tert-butyl side-chain-protecting groups using Reagent K (24King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). A Rink amide or similar resin was used to provide the primary amide form of the C-terminal Asp24 unit. Lyophilized crude peptides were purified by HPLC as described above. Purity and composition of the peptides were verified by analytical HPLC matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard G2025A system and sinapinic acid as matrix and by analysis of amino acid composition of hydrolysates (6 n HCl at 110 °C for 24 h under argon). NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR measurements, freeze-dried DBF analogs were dissolved in water:Me2SO:dodecylphosphocholine mixture. Peptide concentration was 3 mm. pH was adjusted to pH 5.7 by adding μl quantities of NaOD or HCl to the peptide sample. NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian UNITY Plus-600 NMR spectrometer at 25 °C. Two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy with DIPSI (decoupling in the presence of scalar interactions) (25Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar) spinlock (mixing time, 80 ms) was used to identify spin systems. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments (26Wider G. Macura S. Anil-Kumar E rnst R.R. Wüthrich K. J. Magn.

Spectra were collected as 256–512 t1 experiments, each with 2,048 complex data points over a spectral width of 6 kHz in both dimensions with the carrier placed on the water resonance. 16 scans were time-averaged per t1 experiment. Data were processed directly on the spectrometer using VNMR (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) or NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Structural Modeling—Analysis of NOE growth curves indicated that backbone-to-backbone interproton NOEs were normally maximum at about 200 ms. Interproton distance constraints were derived from NOEs assigned in 1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectra acquired with mixing times of 100 ms. NOEs were classified as strong, medium, weak, or very weak corresponding to upper bound distance constraints of 2.3, 2.8, 3.5, and 4.5 Å, respectively. The lower bound restraint between nonbonded protons was set to 1.8 Å. Pseudo-atom corrections were added to the upper bound distance constraints where appropriate, and an 0.5-Å correction was added to the upper bound for NOEs involving methyl protons. Hydrogen bond constraints were identified from the pattern of sequential and interstrand NOEs involving NH and CαH protons together with evidence of slow amide proton-solvent exchange. Each hydrogen bond identified was defined using two distance constraints: r NH-O = 1.8–2.5 Å and r N-O = 1.8–2.5 Å. Derived internuclear distance constraints were used in calculating structures for 6DBF7 by using X-PLOR software (30Brunger A.T. X-plor Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The molecule was created, and a template coordinate set was generated by using the Template software routine. The ab initio simulated annealing protocol was then used. The simulated annealing procedure ran high temperature dynamics (3,000 K for 120 ps) and then cooled down to 100 K in 50-K steps with 1.5 ps molecular dynamics at each step. Powell minimization was performed at 100 K for 1,000 steps. Structure refinement was done based on simulated annealing starting at 1,000 K and ending at 100 K. Final structures were subjected to the X-PLOR Accept software routine with the violation threshold for NOEs of 0.5 Å and dihedral angles of 5°. Angles, bond lengths, or impropers were not allowed to deviate from ideal geometry more than 5°, 0.05 Å, and 5°, respectively. Structures were superimposed using the BIOSYM INSIGHT viewer (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) and were analyzed using X-PLOR analysis routines. Cells, Cultures, and Reagents—Human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells (HUVECs) were harvested from normal human umbilical cords by perfusion with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA. Harvested HUVECs were cultured in gelatin-coated tissue culture flasks and subcultured 1:3 once a week in culture medium (RPMI 1640 with 20% human serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). Bovine capillary endothelial (BCE) cells were kindly provided by Dr. M. Furie (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) and were cultured in fibronectin-coated tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and antibiotics. Proliferation Measurement—EC proliferation was measured using a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. Proliferation of bFGF-stimulated (10 ng/ml) HUVEC cultures was measured by quantification of [3H]thymidine incorporation. Proliferation is expressed as mean counts/min of quadruplicate cultures in three independent experiments (± S.E.). ECs were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in flat-bottomed tissue culture plates and grown for 3 days in culture medium in the absence or presence of regulators. During the last 6 h of the assay, the culture was pulsed with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine/well. HUVECs were harvested from normal human umbilical cords by perfusion with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA. Harvested HUVECs were cultured in gelatin-coated tissue culture flasks and subcultured 1:3 once a week in culture medium (RPMI 1640 with 20% human serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—Sprouting and tube formation of BCEs were studied using Cytodex-3 beads overgrown with BCEs in a three-dimensional collagen gel (Vitrogen-100, Collagen Corp., Fremont, CA) as described by van der Schaft et al. (31van der Schaft D.W. Wagstaff J. Mayo K.H. Griffioen A.W. Ann. Med. 2002; 34: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Following gelation, culture medium containing 20 ng/ml bFGF, with or without anginex or DBF analogs, was applied on top of the gel. After 24 h of cell culture at 37 °C, photographs were made as shown in Fig. 3. The amount of sprouting in each well (i.e. the total length of the sprouts) was quantified by the computer program NIH Image. To quantify differences in sprouting and tube formation, statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Tumor Model Studies in Athymic (Nude) Mice—In all studies, female athymic nude mice (nu/nu, 5–6 weeks old) were used. These mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute and allowed to acclimatize to local conditions for at least 1 week. Animals were given water and standard chow ad libitum and were kept on a 12-h light/dark cycle. All experiments were approved by the University of Minnesota Research Animal Resources ethical committee. Mice were randomized and split into three groups: 1) human serum albumin (10 mg/kg/day), 2) anginex (10 mg/kg/day), and 3) DBF analog (10 mg/kg/day). Compounds were diluted in 100 mm SDS and administered using osmotic mini-pumps (Durect, Cupertino, CA). Exponentially grown MA148 human ovarian carcinoma cells, kindly provided by Prof. Ramakrishnan (18Dings R.P. Yokoyama Y. Ramakrishnan S. Griffioen A.W. Mayo K.H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 382-385PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen). This medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro, Mediatech, Washington, DC) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. 100 μl of this tumor cell suspension (2 × 107 cells/ml) was then injected subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse. Pumps were implanted into the left flanks of the mice for subcutaneous administration of this compound over a 28-day treatment span. Two variants of this model were used: prevention and intervention. For the prevention variant, treatment was initiated at the time of inoculation with MA148 cells. For the intervention variant, tumors were allowed to grow to an average size of 50 mm3 (usually day 7 post-inoculation) before treatment was initiated. With either variant, the animals were randomized prior to the initiation of treatment. Treatment was administered via osmotic mini-pumps (Durect, Cupertino, CA), which were implanted subcutaneously in the left flanks of the mice. Concentrated solutions of anginex or DBF analogs were formulated such that the 28-day treatment period would be covered by implantation of a single pump. In each study, control groups of animals were administered either PBS or PBS containing human serum albumin. Tumor growth curves were found to be virtually identical in either of these control cases. Tumor volume was determined by measuring the diameters of tumors using calipers (Scienceware, Pequannock, NJ) using the equation for the volume of a spheroid: (a 2 × b × π)/6, where “a” is the width and “b” the length of the tumor. Measurements were performed two or three times per week. At the conclusion of an experiment, tumor weights were also taken following excision of the tumors from euthanized animals. Tumor weights correlated well with tumor volumes calculated in this way. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was used to assess microvessel density and the extent of total cell apoptosis. Tumor tissue was embedded in tissue-freezing medium (Miles, Inc., Elkart, IN) and shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections of tissue (10-μm thickness) were prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. For this, tissue sections were brought to room temperature, air-dried overnight, and then fixed in acetone for 10 min. Slides were allowed to air-dry for at least 30 min and were washed three times for 5 min each in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Samples were then blocked with PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 3% human serum albumin for at least 30 min at room temperature in a humidified box. Samples were subsequently incubated with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibody to CD31 (PECAM-1) in a 1:50 dilution (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to stain for microvessel density. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, slides were washed with PBS and immediately imaged using an Olympus BX-60 fluorescence microscope at 200× magnification. To assess the extent of total cell apoptosis, tissue sections were stained by using the TUNEL (terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-nick-end labeling) assay, which was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein; TUNEL, Roche Applied Science). Digital images were stored and processed using Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, Inc., Mountain View, CA). Quantification of microvessel density, the rate of proliferation, and total cell apoptosis were determined as described earlier (32Wild R. Ramakrishnan S. Sedgewick J. Griffioen A.W. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 59: 368-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Toxicity Assays—As an indirect measurement of general toxicity, body weights of mice were monitored twice weekly, using a digital balance (Ohaus; Florham, NJ). To determine hematocrit and creatinine levels, blood samples were extracted by tail vein bleedings 1 day after terminating treatment, and blood was collected in heparinized micro-hematocrit capillary tubes (Fisher). For hematocrit levels, samples were spun down for 10 min in a micro-hematocrit centrifuge (Clay-Adams), and the amount of hematocrit was determined using an international microcapillary reader (IEC; Needham, MA). To obtain creatinine levels, a kit was purchased from Sigma and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Design of a Partial Peptide Mimetic—For input into designing the mimetic, we first performed structure-activity studies on anginex. Working with this relatively small peptide 33-mer allowed for a thorough assessment of functionally key residues by using alanine scanning and walk-through variants. The relative anti-proliferative effect of alanine-substituted analogs of anginex against ECs is plotted in Fig. 1A. Residues that demonstrate the most significant drop in the ability of anginex to inhibit EC proliferation are hydrophobic residues within the first two β-strands: Ile3, Leu5, Val7, Leu11, and Ile20. Conformationally, these functionally key hydrophobic residues all lie on the same face of the amphipathic anti-parallel β-sheet (17Mayo K.H. van der Schaft D.W. Griffioen A.W. Angiogenesis. 2001; 4: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Dings R.P. Arroyo M.M. Lockwood N.A. Van Eijk L.I. Haseman J.R. Griffioen A.W. Mayo K.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 23: 281-288Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also shown in Fig. 1A are anti-proliferation activities of eight walk-through dodecapeptides that successively sample segments of the anginex sequence, shifting three residues in each peptide. Only three walk-through peptides (IC50 values listed at the right) demonstrate any significant anti-proliferative activity relative to parent anginex. As with results from alanine scanning, these peptides also encompass β-strands 1 and 2. Based on these results, we concluded that antiangiogenic activity is localized within β-strands 1 and 2 and that residues in turns 1 and 2 and β-strand 3 are functionally dispensable. For orientation, the β-strand alignment for anginex is depicted in Fig. 1B; portions of the molecule containing the key sequences are boxed. Using this information, we designed the DBF-series of partial peptide mimetics in which β-strand 3 and turn 2 of anginex were omitted and a DBF β-turn mimetic (33Diaz H. Tsang K.Y. Choo D. Espina J.R. Kelly J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 3790-3791Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Tsang K.Y. Diaz H. Graciani N. Kelly J.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 3988-4005Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar) was used in place of residues Phe12 to Lys19. The DBF β-turn mimetic was used to maintain the bioactive β-sheet conformation of anginex (21Dings R.P. Arroyo M.M. Lockwood N.A. Van Eijk L.I. Haseman J.R. Griffioen A.W. Mayo K.H. Biochem. J. 2003; 23: 281-288Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The parent DBF-based compound depicted in Fig. 1C is called 11DBF7, where numbers at the left and right of DBF refer to the number of amino acid residues in the N- and C-terminal strands, respectively, from anginex. To identify the shortest sequences required for bioactivity, a series of N- and C-terminal deletion variants of 11DBF7 was made as listed in Table I.Table IN- and C-terminal deletion variants of 11DBF7 and angiostatic potentialAmino acid sequenceEC proliferation (IC50)SproutingaSignificant inhibition (p < 0.03; Mann-Whitney U test)μM%AnginexParent peptide 33mer38 ± 5bRelative to control culture with medium aloneDBF analogs11DBF7ANIKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND1223 ± 10bRelative to control culture with medium alone10DBF7NIKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND1257 ± 17bRelative to control culture with medium alone9DBF7IKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND2076 ± 406DBF7SVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND1560 ± 12bRelative to control culture with medium alone4DBF7QMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND2599 ± 53DBF7MKL- [DBF] -IIVKLND≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay84 ± 301DBF7L- [DBF] -IIVKLND≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay11DBF6ANIKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLN22115 ± 7.411DBF4ANIKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVK35115 ± 16.311DBF1ANIKLSVQMKL- [DBF] -I23114 ± 13.66DBF6SVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVKLN4296.8 ± 2.76DBF4SVQMKL- [DBF] -IIVK≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay80.4 ± 0.36DBF3SVQMKL- [DBF] -IIV≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay80.0 ± 17.46DBF2SVQMKL- [DBF] -II≫cThe compound had no effect on the assay118 ± 15.86DBF1SVQMKL- [DBF] -I76111 ± 13.6a Significant inhibition (p < 0.03; Mann-Whitney U test)b Relative to control culture with medium alonec The compound had no effect on the assay Open table in a new tab β-Sheet Structure Is Preserved in DBF Analogs—We used NMR spectroscopy to investigate whether β-sheet conformation was preserved in DBF analogs. Analogs 11DBF7 and 6DBF7 (that has more equivalent β-strand lengths) were the focus of this structural study. Because of their limited water solubility and the desire to mimic a membrane-like environment, these compounds were investigated in dodecylphosphocholine micelles. At the millimolar concentrations required for NMR work, 11DBF7 gave overlapping resonances that made spectral analysis ambiguous, whereas 6DBF7 gave excellent NMR spectra that allowed complete structural analysis. NOEs and coupling constants diagnostic of anti-parallel β-sheet conformation were readily identified and used in computational modeling. The superimposed 28 lowest energy structures (Fig. 2A) have a backbone root mean square deviation value (N- and C-terminal residues excluded) of 0.11 Å.

https://openalex.org/W1964262370,"The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) of the LDL receptor (LDLR) promoter mediates oncostatin M (OM)-induced transcription of the LDLR gene through a cholesterol-independent pathway. Our prior studies have detected specific associations of the zinc finger transcription factor Egr1 with the SIRE sequence in OM-stimulated HepG2 cells. Because the SIRE motif is composed of a c/EBP binding site and a cAMP response element, both of which are quite divergent from the classical GC-rich Egr1 recognition sequences, we hypothesized that Egr1 may regulate LDLR transcription through interacting with members of the c/EBP and CREB families. Here, we show that treating HepG2 cells with OM specifically leads to prominent increases of the levels of c/EBPβ and Egr1 bound to the LDLR promoter in vivo. In vitro, the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence is weak, but is strikingly enhanced in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract. Mammalian two-hybrid assays demonstrate that the N-terminal transactivation domain of Egr1 specifically interacts with c/EBPβ but not with c/EBPα or CREB. The OM treatment further enhances this interaction, resulting in a large increase in the Egr1 transactivating activity. The direct protein to protein contact between Egr1 and c/EBPβ is also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, we show that a mutation of the phosphorylation motif of c/EBPβ diminished the OM-stimulated interaction of Egr1 and c/EBPβ. Taken together, we provide strong evidence that Egr1 regulates LDLR transcription via a novel mechanism of protein-protein interaction with c/EBPβ.

The sterol-regulatory element (SRE-1) plays a key role in the cholesterol-mediated negative feedback regulation of the LDLR transcription by interacting with the SRE-1-binding proteins (SREBPs), whose nuclear translocation is controlled by intracellular cholesterol levels (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2960) Google Scholar). The sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) has been recently identified and shown to mediate the stimulatory effects of cytokine oncostatin M (OM), cAMP, and c/EBPβ on LDLR transcription in HepG2 cells in a cholesterol-independent fashion (2Liu J. Ahlborn T.E. Briggs M.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The SIRE motif (TGCTGTAAATGACGTGG) is located at the promoter region of –17 to –1, downstream of the SRE-1 and Sp1 binding sites. It is composed of a c/EBP binding site (–17 to –9) and a CRE site (–8 to –1). Mutations within the SIRE sequence do not affect the cholesterol-mediated suppression and only slightly lower basal promoter activity to levels 60–80% of the wild-type sequence. However, alterations of nucleotides (even a single base) within the SIRE motif can totally prevent the OM-induced increase in the LDLR promoter activity. In vitro DNA binding assays (EMSA) have detected the binding of several basic leucine zipper DNA-binding proteins including c/EBPβ, CREB, ATF1, ATF2, ATF3, and c-Jun to the SIRE sequence (2Liu J. Ahlborn T.E. Briggs M.R. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5214-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These DNA-protein complexes can be detected in unstimulated as well as OM-stimulated nuclear extracts of HepG2 cells. However, stimulation of HepG2 cells with OM induces the formation of a new DNA protein complex, previously referred as the C2 complex. By conducting EMSA, followed by UV-cross-linking and Western blot analysis, we have demonstrated that the unknown DNA-binding protein present in the OM-induced C2 complex is Egr1 (3Zhang F. Ahlborn T.E. Li C. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1477-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay we further showed the specific association of Egr1 with the LDLR promoter in intact HepG2 cells after OM stimulation. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of Egr1 is rapidly induced by OM and its expression precedes the up-regulation of LDLR transcription by OM in HepG2 cells. Additional evidence to link Egr1 with the OM-induced LDLR transcription is the dependence of Egr1 induction and LDLR induction on the activation of the MEK/ERK signaling cascade by OM (3Zhang F. Ahlborn T.E. Li C. Kraemer F.B. Liu J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1477-1485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 4Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Treatment of HepG2 cells with MEK1 inhibitor U0126 not only eliminated Egr1 expression but also abolished the OM activity on LDLR transcription. The functional role of Egr1 in LDLR transcription was assessed by cotransfection of an Egr1 expression vector with an LDLR promoter reporter construct. We showed that overexpression of Egr1 alone does not lead to a significant increase of the LDLR transcription. However, the LDLR promoter activity is markedly up-regulated by coexpression of Egr1 with c/EBPβ in HepG2 cells. These results suggest a cofactor dependence of Egr1 in the regulation of LDLR transcription. Egr1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that binds to a GC-rich motif (GCGT/GGGGCG) through its zinc finger domains (5Christy B. Lau L. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 797-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 6Nathans D. Christy B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Identical or highly similar sites have been shown to be functional regulatory elements in the promoters of Egr1 regulated genes. Intriguingly, the LDLR promoter does not contain a consensus or a homologous Egr1 binding site (EBS). To our knowledge, the SIRE element in the human LDLR promoter is the only recognition sequence of Egr1 that has a GC content less than 50%. This raises an important question: does Egr1 bind to the SIRE DNA directly by itself? If not, what are the cofactors of Egr1 in the recognition of the SIRE motif? In this study, we provide strong evidence from several lines of investigation to demonstrate that c/EBPβ is the partner of Egr1. Egr1 transactivating activity is greatly enhanced by its interaction with c/EBPβ but not with other members of the c/EBP family or the CREB family. Our studies suggest that upon OM stimulation, Egr1 and c/EBPβ constitute an activation complex at the SIRE site that leads to the transcriptional activation of the LDLR gene. Cells and Reagents—The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO). The human embryonal kidney (HEK)-derived cell line HEK293 was obtained from ATCC and was cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies specific to the following proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology: c/EBPβ (sc-150), c/EBPα (sc-15384), c/EBPδ (sc-636), CREB (sc-186), ATF-3 (sc-188), His6 tag (sc-803), and Egr1 (sc-110). The monoclonal antibody (catalog no. 2321) that recognizes the phospho-Thr-Pro motif of ERK substrates was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The constructs of GAL4-Egr1 fusion protein, an Egr1 reporter plasmid pEBS4Luc, and pCITEzif, used in reactions of the in vitro translation of Egr1, have been previously described (7Thiel G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pEF-NFIL6 and plasmid pCMV-NFIL6-T235A were gifts from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan). The plasmids pCIATF2 and pCIATF3 were gifts from Dr. Shigetaka Kitajima at Tokyo Medical & Dental University, Tokyo, Japan. The plasmids RSV-CREB and pCMV-c/EBPα (LB1321) were kindly provided by Dr. Linda M. Boxer at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. The plasmid MSV/EBPδ encoding the mouse c/EBPδ was generously provided by Dr. Steven McKnight at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The plasmid pFR-Luc was obtained from Stratagene. The plasmids of pAD-SV40T and pBD-p53 were obtained from Clontech. Plasmid Constructions—For construction of the vp16AD and the full-length or truncated c/EBPβ fusion proteins, different coding regions of c/EBPβ were amplified by PCR using pEF-NFIL6 as the template and appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers flanked with BamH1 sites. The primer sequences for cloning and other assays are listed in Table I. The GC-rich PCR system (Roche Applied Science) was used to amplify c/EBPβ. The PCR reactions of 35 cycles were carried out at 95 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR fragments were directly cloned into pCR2.1-Topo vector. The insert was isolated with BamH1 digestion and cloned into pVP16 vector (Clontech) at the BamH1 site. The clones encoding the vp16AD-c/EBPβ fusion proteins with the right insert orientation and in the correct reading frame were verified by sequencing. For the construction of a His-tagged c/EBPβ, the coding region (amino acids 24–345) was PCR-amplified and cloned directly into the pcDNA4/HisMax-TOPO vector. The resulting plasmid pcDNA4/His-c/EBPβ-P1 expresses c/EBPβ with its N terminus tagged with six histidine residues. The expression of His-c/EBPβ in HepG2 cells is confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-His monoclonal antibody. The plasmid His-c/EBPβ-T235A was obtained by performing site-directed mutagenesis with pcDNA4/His-c/EBPβ-P1 as the template DNA. The expression vector pCMV-FLAG-Egr1-DN, encoding the dominant-negative mutant of Egr-1, was constructed by inserting a RsaI/BglII fragment of the murine Egr-1 cDNA (nucleotides 2640–3382, GenBank™ accession no. M22326) into plasmid p3XFLAG-CMV-NLS. The protein expressed from this vector contains a triple FLAG sequence MDYKDHDGDYKDHDLDYKDDDDK on the N terminus, followed by a nuclear localization sequence derived from the SV40 large T antigen (sequence LPPKKKRKV), and amino acids 322–533 of Egr-1.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used in cloning, EMSA, and ChIP assayPrimers for vp 16-c/EBPβc/EBPβ-P1 (aa 25-345)Sense strandAAGGATCCGAAGTGGCCAACTTCTaThe BamH1 site is underlined.Antisense strandAAGGATCCCTAGCAGTGGCCGGAc/EBPβ-P2 (aa 25-145)Sense strandAAGGATCCGAAGTGGCCAACTTCTAntisense strandAAGGATCCTTACAGGCGCCCCAGGCTc/EBPβ-P3 (aa 25-245)Sense strandAAGGATCCGAAGTGGCCAACTTCTAntisense strandAAGGATCCTTACGGGGGGGCCTTGGc/EBPβ-P4 (aa 246-345)Sense strandAAGGATCCACCGCCTGCTACGCGGGGGCAntisense strandAAGGATCCCTAGCAGTGGCCGGAPrimers for His-c/EBPβc/EBPβ-P1 (aa 24-345)Sense strandATGGAAGTGGCCAACTTCTACTACGAntisense strandAAGGATCCCTAGCAGTGGCCGGAEMSA oligonucleotidesNucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)SIRECATTGAAATGCTGTAAATGACGTGGGCCCCEgrl consensusGGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGALDLR ChIP primersSense strandCGATGTCACATCGGCCGTTCGAntisense strandCACGACCTGCTGTGTCCTAGCTGGAAa The BamH1 site is underlined. Open table in a new tab In Vitro Translation and Co-immunoprecipitation—Egr1 and c/EBPβ were in vitro translated using the TnT T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate systems (Promega, L4610) with pCITEzif as the template for Egr1 and pcDNA4/His-c/EBPβ-P1 as the template for His-c/EBPβ following the manufacturer's protocol. The plasmids were individually added to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing T7 polymerase and [35S]methionine in a reaction volume of 50 μl at 30 °C for 90 min. The translation products were verified by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For co-immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of translation mixture of 35S-labeled Egr1 was incubated with 10 μl of translation mixture of 35S-labeled His-c/BPβ or with 35S-labeled His-LacZ and diluted to 500 μl with co-immunoprecipitaion buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v). The samples were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with continuous rocking. 25 μlof protein A-agarose beads (50% slurry, Upstate) and 2 μg of His polyclonal antibody were then added and incubated at 4 °C for overnight with continuous rocking. Samples were washed three times with TBS-Tween 0.05% and centrifuged. The pellets were suspended in 20 μl of SDS-loading buffer, heated at 80 °C for 5 min, and centrifuged briefly. The supernatants were loaded onto a 4∼20% PAGE gold precast minigel. After electrophoresis and fluorography, gels were dried and visualized on a phosphorimager. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Egr1 by Activated ERK1/ERK2—The highly purified and already activated ERK1/ERK2 was purchased from Stratagene. An aliquot of Egr1 in vitro translation product was mixed on ice with 4 μlof10× kinase reaction buffer, 1 μl of the activated ERK, and 2 μlof[γ-32P]ATP in a reaction volume of 40 μl. The kinase reaction was executed by incubation of the mixture at 30 °C for 90 min. The standard ERK substrate PHAS-I was used in a separate reaction as a positive control. The phosphorylated products were examined by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. After detection of phosphorylated Egr1, the phosphorylation reaction was repeated using unlabeled ATP. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Oligonucleotide probes were annealed and end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Each binding reaction was composed of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 mm MgCl2,2mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly (dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and an aliquot of Egr1 in vitro translation product without or with 6 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract in a final volume of 40 μl. The samples were incubated with 0.4–0.5 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide probe (40–80 × 103 cpm) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and run in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris base, 400 mm glycine, 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) at 30 mA for 2.5–3 h at 4 °C. Gels were dried and visualized on a phosphorimager. For supershift assays, antibody was incubated with samples for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—HepG2 cells were untreated or treated with OM (50 ng/ml) for 1 h and thereafter were cross-linked with 0.37% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min. Total cell lysate was isolated, and the genomic DNA was sheared to sizes of between 200 and 600 bp by sonication. ChIP assays with rabbit antibodies to c/EBPβ, Egr1, CREB, ATF3, and with normal rabbit IgG as a negative control were performed according to the protocol of Upstate Biotechnology using aliquots of lysate obtained from 5 × 106 cells. The immunocomplex was heated at 65 °C for 4 h to revert the cross-linking between DNA and proteins. DNA was purified by repeated phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified DNA (designated as bound) was dissolved in 20 μl of Tris buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.5). The DNA isolated using the same procedure with omission of the immunoprecipitation step was designated as the input DNA and was diluted 100× prior to PCR. The bound and the input DNA were analyzed by PCR (31 cycles) with primers that amplify a 180-bp fragment of the human LDLR proximal promoter region from –124 to +54, relative to the major transcription start site. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 5 min. The 180-bp PCR product was visualized on a 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The intensity of the PCR products was scanned with a BioRad Fluro-S MultiImager System and quantified by the Quantity One Program. Different amounts of template DNA were tested in the PCR reaction to ensure a linear range of DNA amplification. Transient Transcription and Dual Luciferase Reporter Assays— HepG2 cells were seeded in 48-well plates at 9 × 104 per well in 10% fetal bovine serum the day before transfection. A total of 100 ng of DNA per well was transfected into cells using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, 1814443). The DNA ratios of the analyzing firefly luciferase reporter to expression vector and to Renilla luciferase reporter, pRL-SV40 were 65:25:10. For analysis of the LDLR promoter, transfected cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS)-containing cholesterol (10 μg/ml cholesterol + 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol). For analysis of pFR-Luc activity, transfected cells were incubated in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. 20 h after transfection, OM at the concentration of 50 ng/ml was added, and cells were lysed 4 h later to analyze luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase assay system obtained from Promega. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis of Phosphorylated c/EBPβ—HepG2 cells seeded in 100-mm culture dishes were incubated in 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight. OM was added to cells for 1 h, and cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) in the presence of protease inhibitors. 1 ml of cell lysate containing 500 μg of protein was precleared with isotype-matching IgG for 1 h and then incubated with 2 μg of rabbit anti-c/EBPβ antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. Protein A/G-Sepharose (30 μl/sample) was then added to the lysate, and the mixture was further incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washes, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with SDS sample buffer by boiling, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody that recognizes the phospho-Thr-Pro motif. For detection of phosphorylated His-c/EBPβ or His-c/EBPβ-T235A, HEK293 cells were untransfected or transfected with pcDNA4/His-c/EBPβ-P1 and pcDNA4/His-c/EBPβ-T235A plasmids. Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized, reseeded into two dishes, and cultured overnight in medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. Transfected cells were stimulated with OM for 1 h and harvested for immunoprecipitation with anti-His antibody. The immunoprecipitation complexes were analyzed by Western blotting with the monoclonal antibody that recognizes the phospho-Thr-Pro motif. For other Western blot analyses, cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes and were lysed in 100 μl of whole cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, 1836153). 50 μg of protein from whole cell lysate per sample were used for Western blotting. A Strong Interaction of Egr1 with SIRE DNA Requires Cooperation from other SIRE-binding Proteins—In order to determine whether Egr1 can bind to the SIRE motif by itself or it requires cooperation from other SIRE-binding proteins, we first produced Egr1 protein by using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system. The plasmid pCITEzif encoding Egr1 (8Thiel G. Schoch S. Petersohn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a control plasmid expressing LacZ was added to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate containing T7 polymerase and [35S]methionine. After reactions, translation products were examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1A, a major band with the molecular mass of 82 kDa, corresponding to the reported molecular mass of Egr1 protein on SDS-PAGE (80–82 kDa) was detected in the reaction mixture containing the Egr1 plasmid (lane 1) and was not present in the sample without Egr1 DNA (lane 3). Some proteins with lower molecular mass in the reaction mixture of Egr1 were also shown, which might represent degraded translation products. It has been previously reported that Egr1 contains a single ERK phosphorylation motif (PHSP, amino acids 24–27) residing in the N-terminal transactivation domain (AD) (9Kaufmann K. Bach K. Thiel G. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether ERK-induced phosphorylation of Egr1 affects the binding of Egr1 to the SIRE motif. To produce the phosphorylated Egr1, the highly purified and already activated ERK1/ERK2 was incubated with an aliquot of Egr1 in vitro translation product in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the kinase reaction was executed by incubation of the reaction mixture at 30 °C for 90 min. The standard ERK substrate PHAS-I was used in a separate reaction as a positive control. The phosphorylated products were then examined by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Fig. 1B shows that a 32P-labeled protein migrated as 82 kDa was only detected in the reaction containing the translation product of Egr1 (lane 3). After validation of these methods, we reproduced Egr1 as well as ERK-phosphorylated Egr1 protein using unlabeled methionine and ATP for the subsequent DNA binding assays. To be able to compare the binding affinity of Egr1 to the SIRE sequence with its binding to the classic EBS, a 32P-labeled SIRE probe and a 32P-labeled Egr1 probe were incubated with equal amounts of the Egr1 translation product in the absence or presence of untreated HepG2 nuclear extract, which does not contain a detectable level of the Egr1 protein. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, reaction mixtures were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and results were visualized by a BioRad PhosphorImager. Fig. 1C shows that the binding of Egr1 to the labeled Egr1 probe was very strong and was not affected by the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract (compare lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, the binding of Egr1 to the labeled SIRE probe was weak by itself, however, a strong binding with an increase of 8-fold was detected in the presence of HepG2 nuclear extract (compare lanes 5 and 6). The Egr1-SIRE complex could be totally supershifted by anti-Egr1 antibodies (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 2 and 4), whereas no supershifted band was detected in the reaction only containing the nuclear extract of untreated HepG2 (Fig. 1D, lane 3). The EMSA also revealed that phosphorylation of Egr1 by ERK has no effects on the interaction of Egr1 with Egr1 probe (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4) or the SIRE probe (Fig. 1C, lanes 7 and 8). To further examine the effects of phosphorylation on the DNA binding activities of Egr1, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-Egr1 or pCMV-Egr1-T26A. Two days after transfection, nuclear extracts were prepared from the transfected cells and the EMSA was performed with the nuclear extracts that express the wild-type Egr1 or the phosphorylation-deficient Egr1. The results showed that mutation of T26A on Egr1 did not diminish its DNA binding activity to EBS or SIRE (data not shown). Altogether, these experiments convincingly demonstrate that the binding of Egr1 with SIRE DNA is not affected by ERK-directed phosphorylation but it is strongly enhanced by other SIRE-binding proteins, possibly through protein to protein interaction. Egr1 Interacts Specifically with c/EBPβ—To obtain insights into which SIRE-binding protein may interact with Egr1 at the SIRE motif, initially we examined the in vivo binding of c/EBPβ, CREB, ATF3, as well as Egr1 to the LDLR promoter in control and OM 1 h-stimulated HepG2 cells by ChIP assays. Fig. 2 shows that levels of CREB (lane 2) and ATF3 (lane 4) bound to the SIRE sequence were slightly higher than the IgG control (lane 5) and were not changed by OM stimulation. However, in addition to the increased binding of Egr1 (lane 3), the amount of c/EBPβ (lane 1) bound to the LDLR promoter containing the SIRE site was also markedly increased in OM-stimulated cells. These results indicate that while CREB and ATFs have the ability to bind SIRE DNA in vitro, Egr1 and c/EBPβ are associated with the LDLR promoter in living cells after OM stimulation, and are thus likely to be the true activators that mediate OM-induced LDLR transcription through the SIRE site. To determine whether c/EBPβ functions as a Egr1 coactivator, we performed mammalian two-hybrid assays by using a series of constructs of GAL4-Egr1 fusion proteins (Fig. 3A) and the luciferase reporter pFR-Luc that contains 5 GAL4 binding sites. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc along with GAL4-Egr1 fusion constructs in the absence or presence of expression vectors for c/EBPβ (pEF-NFIL-6) or CREB (RSV-CREB). The plasmid pRL-SV40 expressing the Renilla luciferase was also included as a control vector to normalize the variation of transfection efficiency. 20-h post-transfection, OM was added to cells for 4 h prior to cell lysis. Fig. 3B shows that the transactivating activities of the GAL4 fusion proteins containing the partial AD of Egr1 (pm-Egr1–1) and the whole AD of Egr1 (pm-Egr1–2) were greatly increased by coexpression of c/EBPβ but not by coexpression of CREB, and OM stimulation further increased the stimulatory effect of c/EBPβ. The activity of the fusion protein pm-Egr1–3 that contains the AD and the repression domain (RD) of Egr1 (7Thiel G. Kaufmann K. Magin A. Lietz M. Bach K. Cramer M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 10Gashler A. Swaminathan S. Sukhatme V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4556-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) was not increased by c/EBPβ, suggesting that the presence of the repression domain may interfere with the accessibility of c/EBPβ to the Egr1 AD. To further evaluate the specificity of the Egr1-c/EBPβ interaction, we included the constructs of pBP-p53 and pAD-SV40T in the mammalian two-hybrid assays. As shown in Fig. 3C, the activity of GAL4-Egr1–2 is increased by pEF-NFIL-6 but was not increased by pAD-SV40T that expresses the vp16 AD and SV40 T antigen fusion protein. On the other hand, the activity of GAL4 and p53 fusion protein pBD-p53 was only increased by pAD-SV40T and was not increased by pEF-NFIL6. Importantly, OM has no stimulatory effect for the interaction of p53 and SV40 T antigen. These results confirm the specific interaction between Egr1 and c/EBPβ and further indicate a stimulatory role of OM in this interaction. So far our data have shown that a strong binding of Egr1 to the SIRE DNA requires the presence of other SIRE-binding proteins and that c/EBPβ increases the transactivating activity of Egr1 containing only the N-terminal transcriptional activation domain. These results together suggest that Egr1 may be invol"
https://openalex.org/W1999554820,"Although retinoic acid (RA) has been shown to be critical for lung development, little is known about when RA is required and the role of individual RA receptors (RAR) in this process. Previously reported data from an RA responsive element RARE-lacZ reporter mouse show that when epithelial tubules are branching and differentiating RA signaling becomes markedly down-regulated in the epithelium. It is unclear why this down-regulation occurs and what role it might play in the developing lung. Here we analyze the effects of preventing potential progenitors of the distal lung from turning off RA signaling by locally expressing constitutively activated RARα or RARβ chimeric receptors (RARVP16) in branching airways of transgenic mice. Continued RA activation resulted in lung immaturity in both cases, but the phenotypes were remarkably different. RARαVP16 lungs did not expand to form saccules or morphologically identifiable type I cells. High levels of surfactant protein C (Sp-C), thyroid transcription factor-1 (Ttf1), and Gata6, but not Sp-A or Sp-B in the epithelium at birth suggested that in these lungs differentiation was arrested at an early stage. These alterations were not observed in RARβVP16 lungs, which showed relatively less severe changes. Our data suggest a model in which activation of RAR signaling at the onset of lung development establishes an initial program that assigns distal cell fate to the prospective lung epithelium. Down-regulation of RA signaling, however, is required to allow completion of later steps of this differentiation program that ultimately form mature type I and II cells.

Retinoids play an important role in development and homeostasis of a variety of organs, including the lung (1Wilson J.G. Roth C.B. Warkany J. Am. J.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). In the lung these receptors are expressed from the earliest developmental stages throughout embryonic and postnatal life. While RARβ and RARγ transcripts are regionally and dynamically distributed in the developing lung, expression of RARα and all RXRs is ubiquitous and does not change in time or space. At the onset of lung development (E9.5) these receptors are present in the foregut endoderm in largely overlapping domains. During branching and until birth, however, epithelial expression of RARβ in the lung is excluded from the distal buds and is maintained in proximal and medium size airways. The distal epithelium expresses RARγ in addition to the ubiquitously expressed RARα (5Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Malpel S.M. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mollard R. Viville S.

The role of these receptors in organogenesis has been studied by genetic inactivation of RAR/RXRs individually or in combination in mice. Dramatic abnormalities reported in RARα/RARβ double knockout mice, which include unilateral agenesis and contralateral lung hypoplasia, strongly support a role for these receptors in lung morphogenesis (3Mendelsohn C. Lohnes D. Decimo D. Lufkin T. LeMeur M. Chambon P. Mark M. Development. 1994; 120: 2749-2771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is still unclear which function individual RARs might have, since single knockout mice show few or no lung abnormalities, presumably due to functional redundancy (4Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2575) Google Scholar). As suggested by in vitro studies, this redundancy does not necessarily demonstrate that one RAR can substitute for another under normal wild-type conditions (9Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Another issue that remains unclear relates to when lung epithelial cells require retinoids to grow and differentiate. The presence of high levels of the RA synthesizing enzyme retinaldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (Raldh2) and RARElacZ reporter gene expression in the E9.5 lung suggests that RA is required at the onset of lung development (6Malpel S.M. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Severe disruption of RA signaling in mice lacking Raldh2 or in vitamin A-deficient rats results in early embryonic lethality or in lung agenesis, conditions that do not allow the evaluation of retinoid-dependent events in the lung at later stages (10Niederreither K. Subbarayan V. Dolle P. Chambon P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 2Dickman E.D. Thaller C. Smith S.M. Development. 1997; 124: 3111-3121PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies in lung cell and organ cultures implicate RA in branching morphogenesis and lung epithelial differentiation (11Schuger L. Varani J. Mitra Jr., R. Gilbride K. Dev. Biol. 1993; 159: 462-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 12Cardoso W.V. Williams M.C. Mitsialis S.A. Joyce-Brady M. Rishi A.K. Brody J.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 12: 464-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 13Metzler M.D. Snyder J.M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1990-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of endogenous retinoids in these events in vivo has been challenged by the observation that RA signaling is markedly down-regulated in epithelial tubules when branching and differentiation are taking place in the embryo (6Malpel S.M. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we investigated the role of this down-regulation and how growth and differentiation of the distal lung epithelium are influenced by RA signaling in vivo. To address these issues we tested the effect of maintaining RA signaling activated solely in the lung epithelium and in an isotype-specific fashion throughout embryonic lung development. We generated transgenic mice expressing ligand-independent, constitutively active RARs under the control of the lung epithelial-specific surfactant protein C (Sp-C) promoter (14Wert S. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). We used chimeric receptors in which the C terminus of RARα or β is fused to the acidic activation domain (AAD) of the herpes simplex viral protein VP16. Analyses of the transactivation properties of these receptors show that, when co-transfected with a reporter gene containing an RA responsive element, the RARVP16 differentially activates gene expression in P19 and CV1 cells. The chimeras rely on endogenous retinoid receptors for heterodimerization and promoter recognition and appear to mimic many of the functions of the endogenous receptors (15Colbert M.C. Hall D.G. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A. Lorenz J.N. Kirby M.L. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Robbins J. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report important functional differences between RARα and β not revealed by former genetic approaches. αVP16 lungs did not expand to form saccules or morphologically identifiable type I cells; distal identity was maintained, but differentiation was arrested at a stage reminiscent of that of an early pseudoglandular lung. These alterations were not observed in βVP16 lungs, which underwent later stages of differentiation and showed relatively less severe changes. Our data support the idea that distal lung differentiation cannot occur in the presence of activated RA signaling. They also indicate that putative precursors of the distal lung in branching tubules selectively respond to RARα activation by maintaining a distal developmental program characteristic of early stages. We propose a model in which RA signaling, via RARα, primes early lung bud cells to become distal, being subsequently down-regulated to allow further steps of the distal differentiation program. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The chimeric receptors used in our study have been previously described and tested in cell lines by Underhill et al. (16Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar). They consisted of the C terminus of the human RARα or the mouse RARβ2 genes fused to the acidic activation domain of the herpes simplex virus protein VP16. RARαVP16 (1282 bp) and RARβVP16 (1516 bp) constructs were cloned into the HindIII-SpeI sites of a pGL3 vector (Promega) containing a 3.7-kb fragment of the human surfactant protein C (Sp-C) promoter. This promoter has been shown to direct transgene expression specifically to the lung distal epithelium, with increasing activity toward birth (14Wert S. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev.

The resulting Sp-C-RARVP16 constructs (Fig. 1A) were digested with AatII and NotI, purified and injected in FVB mouse fertilized eggs, and subsequently transplanted into pseudopregnant mothers. A diagram summarizing the expression pattern of endogenous and transgenic RARs is presented in Fig. 1B. Transgenic mice were identified by Southern blot analysis of tail genomic DNA (10 ug) using a 300-bp BglII-BamHI VP16 fragment as a probe (16Underhill T.M. Cash D.E. Linney E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 274-285PubMed Google Scholar). A calibration curve with serial dilutions of the digested plasmid was run in parallel using 10 μg of wild-type genomic DNA as a carrier to estimate number of copies of transgene inserted per genome. To check whether RA signaling was activated by transgene expression in RARVP16 expressing lungs, we crossed Sp-C-RARβ-VP16 mice with a well characterized reporter mouse in which lacZ is under the control of a RA response element (RARE)-hsp68 promoter (17Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). β-galactosidase staining of Sp-C-RARβ/RARE-lacZ lungs was performed at E18.5 as described in Malpel et al. (6Malpel S.M. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Morphology/Transgene Expression—For all procedures lungs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C and processed for paraffin sections (5 μm). Histological analysis was performed in hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-stained sections. Sites of transgene expression were determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry using RAR isotype-specific reagents and anti VP16 antibody (see below). In Situ Hybridization—We performed isotopic in situ hybridization in lung sections, as previously described (18Cardoso W.V. Mitsialis S.A. Brody J.S. Williams M.C. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using 35S-labeled riboprobes synthesized from cDNA clones of Shh, Ptc, Bmp4 (gifts from Dr. Andrew P. McMahon, Harvard Biolabs), Ttf1 (gift from Dr. Parviz Minoo, University of Southern California), RARα and β (gifts from Dr. Cathy Mendelsohn, Columbia University), Fgf10 (gift from Dr. Nobuyuki Itoh, Kyoto University), Gata6 (gift from Dr. Michael Parmacek, University of Pennsylvania), Sp-A, Sp-B, and Sp-C (12Cardoso W.V.

Williams M.C. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, sections were deparaffinized and re-hydrated. Pre-hybridization included treatment of sections with 4% paraformaldehyde, digestion with proteinase K (20 μg/ml), and acetylation with 0.25% acetic anhydride/1.4% triethanolamine. Sections were hybridized overnight at 50 °C and subsequently washed with 5× SSC-50% formamide, dehydrated with graded alcohols/0.3 m ammonium acetate, and dried at room temperature for autoradiography. Sections were dipped in photographic emulsion (Kodak, NTB-2), incubated at 4 °C for 1–3 weeks, and developed in Kodak D-19 developer. Antibodies/Immunohistochemistry—Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and washed in PBS. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol. Sections were preincubated with the appropriate preimmune serum (rabbit or goat), and then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The antibodies used in this investigation were: Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp, goat, polyclonal anti-rabbit, gift from Drs. Singh and Katyal, University of Pittsburgh), T1α (mAB 8.1.1, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, University of Iowa), VP16 (rabbit, polyclonal anti-mouse, Clontech), RARα and β (rabbit, polyclonal anti-mouse, gifts from Dr. Pierre Chambon). Immunostaining was performed using the anti-rabbit and anti-goat IgG Vectastain and the DAB staining kits from Vector Laboratories, according to the manufacturers' protocol. For counterstaining, methyl green was used. Assessment of Cell Proliferation/Death—Changes in cell proliferation were assessed by PCNA staining (cell proliferation kit, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Cell death was investigated by TUNEL assays (Apoptag kit, Intergen). Immunostaining was performed as above or according to manufacturer's specifications. Morphometric Analyses—We performed a computer-assisted morphometric analysis of T1α-stained sections to estimate the area occupied by labeled (distal epithelium) versus unlabeled (mesenchyme) cells in control and βVP16 transgenic lungs. T1α specifically labels type I cells, which encompass the vast majority of the epithelial surface of the distal lung (19Williams M.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Digital images from 10 random peripheral fields were acquired at 40× magnification and analyzed using OpenLab software (Improvision, Inc.) with the density slice module and advanced measurement settings. Optical densities correspondent to epithelium (T1α positive) or mesenchyme (non-positive tissue) were estimated. Results were normalized as percent of total tissue to correct for differences in inflation of the lungs. In addition, we used TUNEL- or PCNA-stained sections to estimate the number of cells undergoing apoptosis or proliferation in wild-type, α, and β VP16 mice. For this we counted labeled and unlabeled nuclei in epithelium and mesenchyme in 6–8 random peripheral fields at 40× magnification (∼250 cells per field). Results were expressed as percent of total cells. Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) Staining—We used the PAS-staining kit (Sigma) to detect glycogen in lung sections. Briefly, after being depar-affinized and rehydrated, sections were preincubated with either buffer (PBS) solution or diastase solution, for 10 min. After washing with PBS both groups were treated with 0.5% periodic acid solution for 5 min and then with Schiff's reagent for 1 min. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Specificity of staining for glycogen was confirmed by loss of PAS signals when sections were pretreated with diastase. Sp-C-RARVP16 Regulation by RA—We performed a preliminary study in the mouse lung epithelial cell MLE 15 cells to check whether the 3.7kb Sp-C promoter fragment was itself regulated by RA. MLE 15 are immortalized type II epithelial cells originated from lung tumors of transgenic mice expressing the SV40 large T antigen under the control of the same 3.7-kb Sp-C promoter used here (20Ikeda K. Clark J.C. Bachurski C.J. Wikenheiser K.A. Cuppoletti J. Mohanti S. Morris R.E. Whitsett J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L309-L317PubMed Google Scholar). We treated MLE15 cells with RA (10–9-10–5m) for 24 h and assessed expression of SV40 large T antigen by semiquantititative PCR. Fig. 1C shows that levels of SV40T were not significantly changed by RA at any of the concentrations tested. Thus, RA signaling induced by the Sp-C-RARVP16 constructs is not expected to interfere with its own transcription. RAR α and β Activation Differentially Affects Survival—To investigate viability at birth and to obtain F0 founders, pregnancies were allowed to reach term and pups were observed during their initial 24 h of life. While 2 of 4 pups identified as βVP16 transgenics survived and reached adulthood, no αVP16 newborn from three independent injections lived for more than 10 min. At least 4 αVP16 pups died at birth; 3 were found partially cannibalized by the mother. An additional injection of the αVP16 construct was performed and embryos were dissected at E18.5; one was identified as transgenic. In all transgenics lung morphology was grossly preserved; proximal and distal lung formed and the number of lobes was normal. Collapse or uneven inflation was common in both α and β transgenes at birth. Transgenic lungs were not markedly different in size from wild type, although αVP16 mice were slightly smaller than the other groups at E18.5 and at birth, as illustrated in Fig. 1, D and E. βVP16 mice that reached adulthood were apparently normal and fertile; however, one of the lines developed lung tumors within the first year of age. In the present study we analyzed the lung phenotype of transient transgenics αVP16 or βVP16 that died at birth. RARβVP16 Activates RARE-lacZ Reporter Gene—Because some βVP16 pups survived and their lungs appeared grossly normal, we tested whether the βVP16 construct efficiently activated RA signaling in the lung. We crossed mice from a surviving line (RARβVP16, copy number = 5) into a background of a RARE-lacZ transgenic reporter mouse previously shown to express lacZ at sites where RARs are activated (17Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado D. Giguere V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Xgal staining of Sp-C-RARβVP16/RARE-lacZ lungs at E18.5 confirmed lacZ expression in the distal lung epithelium (Fig. 1G) where we expected to find RARβVP16 transcripts. This pattern of staining and the absence of lacZ signals in lungs of wild-type littermates (Fig. 1F) indicated that RA signaling, normally inactive at this stage (6Malpel S.M. Mendelsohn C. Cardoso W.V. Development. 2000; 127: 3057-3067Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was activated by the βVP16 transgene in the distal lung. Expression of Endogenous RARs and RARVP16 Transgenes in the Lung—To determine sites of transgene expression we first performed immunohistochemistry of lung sections using a polyclonal antibody raised against the VP16 epitope. Fig. 2 (A–C) shows specific VP16 staining in distal lung epithelium of both transgenes, not observed in wild type. We then assessed RAR expression by in situ hybridization using isotype-specific RAR probes that recognized both endogenous and chimeric receptors. At birth wild-type lungs express ubiquitous endogenous RARα and no RARβ signals in the distal epithelium (Fig 2, D and G and Ref. 5Dolle P. Ruberte E. Leroy P. Morriss-Kay G. Chambon P. Development. 1990; 110: 1133-1151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). αVP16 transgene expression was readily identified by the strong distal signals, in sharp contrast to the low levels of endogenous RARα (Fig. 2E). This is also illustrated in βVP16 lungs, where high levels of RARβ expression in type II cells and epithelial cells occupying the most distal portions of terminal bronchioles (Fig. 2I, red arrowhead) contrast with the low endogenous signals in proximal airways (Fig. 2G, yellow arrowhead). Although transgenic mice had different gene copy numbers (αVP16 n = 1, βVP16 n = 20), the chimeric receptors appeared to be expressed in the distal lung epithelium at equivalent high levels in a per cell basis. No significant difference in the intensity of RAR signals in the distal epithelium was observed by in situ hybridization (Fig. 2, E and I) or immunostaining (Fig. 2J) when sections of αVP16 and βVP16 lungs were processed in parallel. Because of the consistent lethal phenotype at birth, we could not generate a line of αVP16 mice in RARElacZ background as we did with βVP16 mice. However, the presence of endogenous RARβ ectopically induced in distal epithelial tubules of αVP16 lungs indicated that RA signaling was efficiently activated (Fig. 2H, red arrowhead). Together the data suggest that the difference in the severity of the α or βVP16 phenotypes is likely related to the type of RAR being activated rather than to a difference in levels of RAR expression of each transgenic construct. Constitutively Activated RARα, but Not β Disrupts Type I Cell Development and Sacculation—At birth the distal lung of a wild type mouse consists of saccular structures lined by flat type I cells, and by cuboidal surfactant-producing type II cells (Fig. 3A). Expression of αVP16 transgene dramatically altered the architecture of the distal lung (Fig 3B). Formation of typical saccules was impaired and instead, tubule-like structures lined by a low columnar epithelium that lacked flat type I-like cells were present. Consistent with disruption of type I cell development was the nearly absent expression of the marker T1α in these tubules (Fig. 3E). Mature type I cells characteristically express T1α, aquaporin 5, caveolin 1, and ICAM 1 (19Williams M.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 669-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Genetic studies, however, show that among these markers only T1α loss affects type I cell formation when its expression is disrupted in mice (21Ramirez M.I. Millien G. Hinds A. Cao Y. Seldin D.C. Williams M.C. Dev. Biol. 2003; 256: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Overall, αVP16 expressing structures resemble immature epithelial tubules normally seen in the lung at the early pseudoglandular stage (∼E10-11). The phenotype was consistently seen in αVP16 lungs at E18.5 and at birth. By contrast, none of these changes were observed in βVP16 lungs, which showed saccular structures with morphologic features compatible with typical type I and II epithelial cells using T1α staining (Fig. 3, C and F). Expression of α or βVP16 transgenes did not disrupt proximal epithelial differentiation as seen by the proper expression of Clara cell secretory protein (Ccsp) and location of ciliated cells (Fig. 3, G–I). Moreover, blood vessel formation was not grossly disrupted in any of these mice as indicated by morphology, PECAM staining of endothelial cells, or epithelial expression of the angiogenic factor VEGF (data not shown). Activation of RARα but Not β Prevents Expression of Sp-B and Sp-A—To investigate the differentiation status of the RARVP16 epithelia we assessed expression of early (Sp-C) and late (Sp-B, Sp-A) markers of lung type II cells (22Mendelson C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 875-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). During normal development Sp-C expression has been reported in the lung by in situ hybridization at E10–10.5, but signals can be detected by PCR in the foregut endoderm as early as E9–9.5 (Refs. 14Wert S. Glasser S.W. Korfhagen T.R. Whitsett J.A. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 426-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar and 23Perl A. Wert S. Nagy A. Lobe C. Whitsett J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10482-10487Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). 2M. Ramirez, personal communication.Fig. 4A illustrates the restricted expression of Sp-C to type II cells in wild-type neonatal lungs. Strong Sp-C signals were found in the majority of the cells lining distal epithelial tubules of αVP16 lungs (Fig. 4B). These tubules, however, showed virtually no expression of Sp-B and Sp-A, markers that, unlike Sp-C, normally appear in the distal epithelium only by E14 and E16, respectively (Fig. 4, D, E, G, and H; Ref. 22Mendelson C.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 875-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These and the results from the former section indicate that αVP16 epithelial cells are distal in fate, but are likely immature. Moreover, they suggest that both programs of type I and type II cell differentiation, characteristic of later stages of development, are disrupted by constitutive activation of RARα. By contrast strong Sp-C, Sp-B, and Sp-A signals were detected in the epithelium of βVP16 mice, as seen in wild type (Fig. 4, C, F, and I). Lung Cell Proliferation and Cell Death Are Altered by Constitutively Activated RARs—PCNA immunostaining of wild-type newborn lungs showed few scattered labeled cells in the distal lung, confirming previous reports that distal cell proliferation is minimal at birth (Fig. 5A and Ref. 8Hind M. Corcoran J. Maden M. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 282: L468-L476Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By contrast αVP16 lungs showed a dramatic increase in number of PCNA-labeled nuclei (Fig. 5, B and D). Labeling was predominantly epithelial (∼ 80% of total labeled cells) but was also present in the mesenchyme (20%). Since the αVP16 lungs are not bigger than wild type lungs, we reasoned that the increase in proliferation should be accompanied by transgene-induced increase in cell death. Thus, we estimated the number of apoptotic nuclei in these lungs by TUNEL assay. In wild-type TUNEL-labeled nuclei were infrequent; most of the cells counted in the distal fields (∼90%) were unlabeled (Fig. 5, E and H). In αVP16 lungs, however, TUNEL-positive cells averaged 40% of total cells; 70% of the labeled cells were epithelial (Fig. 5, F and H). The increased cell proliferation and cell death in the peripheral lung suggest that rapid turnover was taking place at sites of αVP16 transgene expression. The changes described above were also found, but to a lesser extent, in βVP16 lungs (Fig. 5, C and G). It is likely, however, that cell proliferation and cell death are stimulated at comparable levels by both α and β transgenes. Differences in PCNA labeling depicted in Fig. 5D possibly reflect the fact that αVP16-expressing cells, unlike the βVP16, do not undergo type I cell differentiation, and thus continue to proliferate. Ttf1 and Fgf10 Are Up-regulated in αVP16 Lungs—To gain insights into how the RARVP16 phenotypes originated, we investigated expression of thyroid transcription factor-1 (Ttf1 or Nkx 2.1), and fibroblast growth factor Fgf10, known regulators of early distal lung development. No distal lung structures form in mutant mice lacking these genes (24Bellusci S. Grindley J. Emoto H. Itoh N. Hogan B.L. Development. 1997; 124: 4867-4878Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Park W.Y.

A plethora of in vitro data currently suggests that the second coding exon of Tat is largely devoid of function. However, whether the second exon of Tat contributes functionally to viral pathogenesis in vivo remains unknown.

Relevant to this concept, the selection of viral mutations associated with loss of CTL response has been found in HIV-1 as well as simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infections (10McMichael A.J. Rowland-Jones S.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 11Evans D.T. O'Connor D.H. Jing P. Dzuris J.L. Sidney J. da Silva J. Allen T.M. Horton H. Venham J.E.

Nature. 2000; 407: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Hence, in HIV-infected patients, CTL escape mutations in nef, env, and gag have been detailed (10McMichael A.J. Rowland-Jones S.L. Nature. 2001; 410: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Indeed, escape from immunodominant CTL response is associated with progression to AIDS (13Goulder P.J. Phillips R.E. Colbert R.A. McAdam S. Ogg G. Nowak M.A. Giangrande P. Luzzi G. Morgan B. Edwards A. McMichael A.J. Rowland-Jones S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). Current thinking suggests that vaccines, which induce CTL responses to HIV, although incapable of preventing infection, could provide partial or complete protection from AIDS progression. The efficacy of such CTL-inducing vaccines is, however, limited by the propensity to select for escape mutations (14Mortara L. Letourneur F. Gras-Masse H. Venet A. Guillet J.G. Bourgault-Villada I. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extreme mutability of HIV as evidenced by its rapid development of resistance to reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors is well documented (reviewed in Refs. 15Mayers D. AIDS. 1996; 10: S9-S13PubMed Google Scholar and 16Boucher C. AIDS. 1996; 10: S15-SS9PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, elucidation of immunologically important epitope(s) constrained against mutation by functional or structural value to viral survival would represent an important advance for vaccine development. Currently, no description of such a candidate exists. Several HIV open reading frames such as env and protease are highly susceptible to second site compensatory mutations that rescue functions lost through original mutations (17Stern T.L. Reitz Jr., M.S. Robert-Guroff M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1860-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Moore J.P. Willey R.L. Lewis G.K. Robinson J. Sodroski J. J.

AIDS. 1999; 13: 2349-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Functional constraints, which serve to limit mutation, would appear to be poorly operative for these viral proteins. On the other hand, more compact HIV open reading frames necessary for viral viability may be less tolerant of mutations. The HIV/SIV Tat protein is a small regulatory polypeptide whose function is essential for virus replication (reviewed in Ref. 20Jeang K.T. Gatignol A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994; 188: 123-144PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that CTL response against Tat may be more efficacious in controlling infection than comparable responses to viral structural proteins (21Stittelaar K.J. Gruters R.A. Schutten M. van Baalen C.A. van Amerongen G. Cranage M. Liljestrom P. Sutter G. Osterhaus A.D. Vaccine. 2002; 20: 2921-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, the importance of such a finding is tempered by an observation that a CTL epitope in the first coding exon of SIV Tat quickly mutates upon acute immune selection (12Allen T.M. O'Connor D.H. Jing P. Dzuris J.L. Mothe B.R. Vogel T.U. Dunphy E. Liebl M.E. Emerson C. Wilson N. Kunstman K.J. Wang X. Allison D.B. Hughes A.L. Desrosiers R.C. Altman J.D. Wolinsky S.M. Sette A. Watkins D.I. Nature. 2000; 407: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Recently, Walker and colleagues (22Addo M.M. Altfeld M. Rosenberg E.S. Eldridge R.L. Philips M.N. Habeeb K. Khatri A. Brander C. Robbins G.K. Mazzara G.P. Goulder P.J. Walker B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) have defined for HIV-1 an optimal epitope in the first coding exon of Tat and have suggested that CTL could be disease-effective if targeted to a region of Tat functionally constrained against immune-induced mutations. Here, we report that the second coding exon of Tat contains a function important for in vivo SIV replication in macaques and that CTL response against this region of Tat durably controls SIV replication. We provide evidence that CTL escape mutation in the second coding exon of Tat occurs with a prohibitive loss of replicative fitness. Our results lead us to propose the second coding exon of Tat as an example of a functionally constrained epitope to which effective in vivo CTL response could control viral infection because CTL escape mutations in this epitope result in viruses that replicate poorly in vivo.

The SphI-MunI segment of pNdBpuRQ, was isolated, the MunI site was blunted with Klenow polymerase, and the segment was cloned into the SphI-SmaI sites of pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) to form the shuttle vector, pSP72SIV. The three point mutations, as described under “Results,” were then introduced by PCR cloning, and the segment containing the mutations was cloned back into pNdBpuRQ to make pSIVtat1ex. For purposes of this study, SIV generated from the pNdBpuRQ clones is SIVmac239. Viral Stocks—The viral stocks were prepared by lipofection of the plasmid DNAs into 293T cells (AIDS Reagent Program, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The cells were then cultured for 3 days. The supernatant was harvested, clarified, and aliquoted. Stock aliquots only underwent one freeze-thaw cycle. The TCID50 of each stock was determined on CEM-X-174 cells (AIDS Repository) and calculated using the methods of Reed and Muench (23Reed L.J. Muench H.A. Am. J. Hyg. 1983; 27: 493-497Google Scholar). Rev Assay—Using LipofectAMINE (as above), 293T cells were transfected with 4 μg of pDM128-CAT (Rev-dependent CAT expression vector) (24Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and with 2 μg of pSIVtat1ex, pSIVtat2ex, pUC, or pRSV-Rev (Rev expression vector) in 6-well plates. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection and analyzed for CAT content by CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Virus Infection—Each stock was diluted in serum-free RPMI medium to a concentration of 100 infectious units/ml on the day of infection. Each animal then received 1 ml of the appropriate stock through intravenous injection. Branched DNA—Branched bDNA assays were performed at Bayer Corp. (Emeryville, CA) as described previously (25Dailey P.J. Zamround M. Kelso R. Kolberg J. Urea M. J. Med. Primatol. 1995; 24: 209Google Scholar). Plasma from heparinized blood was separated and stored at -70 °C until it was assayed. The lower limit of detection was 1500 SIVmac viral genome copies/ml. The assay has a specificity of 96% (26Booth, J., Dailey, P. J., Wingfield, C., Sawyer, L., and Sheridan, P. (1998) in 16th Annual Symposium on Nonhuman Primate Models for AIDS, Atlanta, Georgia, October 7–10, Yerkes Primate Center, Emory UniversityGoogle Scholar). PCR Cloning—After virus from plasma was pelleted, RNA was extracted with standard techniques. Reverse transcription was performed with primer, Out2 (see below), and enzyme, M-MuLV (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Nested PCR was performed on the reverse-transcribed DNA with an outer primer pair (Out1, 5′-TGGAGGTTCTGGAAGAACTG-3′, and Out2, 5′-CTCCAAGCTGGTACACCATA-3′) and an inner primer pair (In1, 5′-GGAGGTTCTGGAAGAACTGA-3′, and In2, 5′-GGATGGCGATAAGCAGCTGAT-3′) from the tat region of SIVmac. PCR products were cloned using the Original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. CD4+ Cell Staining and Quantification—T-cell numbers were evaluated by flow cytometry using fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies with the following specificities: CD3-fluorescein (clone SP34; Pharmingen), CD4-phycoerythrin (clone Leu3a; Immunocytometry Systems), and CD8-Per-CP (clone Leu2a; BD Biosciences). The relative numbers of CD3+CD4+ cells, CD3+CD8+ cells, and fluorescent beads, as determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), were used to calculate the numbers of these cells per μl of blood according to the formula provided by the manufacturer's instructions. γ-Interferon ELISPOT and Intracellular Cytokine Staining—Macaque PBMCs, purified by standard Ficoll separation and frozen in Me2SO-freezing media, were thawed and examined for γ-interferon production after stimulation with SIV peptides. Nitrocellulose, microtiter plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were incubated with an anti-γ-interferon antibody (B27; Pharmingen) at 2 μg/ml overnight at 4 °C. After the wells were washed and blocked, PBMCs (1–4 × 105) were added to each well in 100 μl of RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum. Peptide pools (2–3 peptides/pool) were added in 100 μl of RPMI/10% fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 2–4 μg/ml. The cells and peptides were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 36 h. After washing, a second anti-γ-interferon antibody (Clone 7-86-1; Diapharma, West Chester, OH) at 1 μg/ml in 100 μl was added, and the wells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed again. Avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was added in 100 μl, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Wells were washed six times, and the spots were developed with undiluted 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (ResGen, Huntsville, AL) for ∼10 min at room temperature. After the wells were rinsed with H2O, the spots on the membrane of each well were counted under a stereomicroscope. All cell-peptide pool samples were run in duplicate. The Tat (15-mer) peptides were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. The number of spot-forming cells/106 PBMCs was calculated by subtracting the background (the number of spots in the control wells) and adjusting for cell number per well and then normalized by a factor of 6 to control for the freeze-thaw effect. In control studies, the freeze-thaw cycle reduced ELISPOT spot-forming cells by an average of 6-fold. All reported data were at least twice the level of the negative control. For intracellular cytokine staining, fresh PBMCs were separated from the whole blood of animal L840 drawn 3.5 years after infection. The final nine,15-mer peptides (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program catalog numbers 5429–5437) of Tat were used to individually stimulate CD8+ T-cells. The peptides overlap by 11 amino acids and have at least 1 amino acid in the second exon of Tat. Staphylococcal enterotoxin B was used a positive control for activation. Cell staining, flow cytometric analysis, and data processing were done strictly according to the BD Biosciences protocol for rhesus blood. Antibodies used for the cell staining were a-CD3 fluorescein isothiocyanate (clone SP34, Pharmingen), α-CD8 PerCP (clone SK-1, Immunocytometry Systems), a-CD69 PE (clone L78, Immunocytometry Systems), and a-TNFα APC (clone 6401.1111, Immunocytometry Systems). For each peptide or staphylococcal enterotoxin B stimulation, the percentage of TNFα producing CD8- and CD69-positive lymphocytes was calculated by computer analysis. The results were analyzed using the BD Bioscience method. The Second Coding Exon of Tat Is Important for SIV Replication in Macaque—Previously, we and others have shown that the second coding exon of Tat is important for in vitro HIV-1 replication in human PBMCs (27Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate this requirement in vivo, we constructed two otherwise isogenic forms of SIVmac239 differing only in their second coding exon of Tat. SIVtat1ex, which encodes only the first coding exon of tat, was constructed from SIVmac239 by mutating codons 96 and 97 of Tat from GCA-TCA to TGA-TAA (bases 6843–6847 in SIVmm239 GenBank™ M33262; underlined nucleotides were changed as indicated), which generated two consecutive stop codons at the end of the first coding exon of Tat (Fig. 1A). We confirmed by direct sequencing that pSIVtat1ex encodes only a 95-amino-acid truncated 1st-exon Tat. Because the rev reading frame (1+ relative to tat) overlaps tat in this region of the genome, we checked that our nucleotide changes were conservative for Rev function. Direct measurements using a Rev-dependent CAT reporter plasmid (24Hope T.J. McDonald D. Huang X.J. Low J. Parslow T.G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5360-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) verified that Rev function was unchanged between SIVtat1ex and SIVmac239 (Fig. 1B). We next generated viral stocks by transfecting SIVmac239 and SIVtat1ex in parallel into 293T cells. Three days after transfection, the tissue culture media were clarified and aliquoted as viral stocks. The p27 values of the viral stocks were 1.4 ng/ml for pSIVmac239 and 2.7 ng/ml for SIVtat1ex. TCID50 values, as determined on CEM-X-174 cells, were 3083 and 4050 infectious units/ml for SIVmac239 and SIVtat1ex, respectively. We infected intravenously six adult macaques with 100 TCID50 of either SIVmac239 (two animals, M154 and N361) or SIVtat1ex (four animals, L840, L855, L882, and N200). Blood samples were collected serially for viral load and CD4 measurements. The viral load in all six animals peaked between days 14 and 17 (Fig. 2, A and B) after infection. The observed viral peaks were roughly equivalent (∼108 copies/ml) in the two groups and comparable with values documented previously in the majority of our animals infected with SIVmac (28Smith S.M. Holland B. Russo C. Dailey P.J. Marx P.A. Connor R.I. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1999; 15: 1691-1701Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the post-acute period (> 6 weeks), the two SIVmac239-infected animals had high set point plasma viral load (>107 copies/ml). By comparison, the four SIVtat1ex-infected animals controlled viremia relatively better. Two (N200 and L882) had viral loads consistently near 106 copies/ml, whereas the other two (L840, L855) had viral load values that became virtually undetectable by days 60–160 after infection. A More Severe Disease Course Is Seen in SIVmac239-infected than SIVtat1ex-infected Macaques—Other than their tat gene, SIVmac239 and SIVtat1ex are isogenic. Hence, a comparison of the disease courses engendered by the two viruses should reveal the contribution (if any) of the second Tat exon to in vivo pathogenesis. We, thus, examined the CD4+ cell profile and the clinical outcomes in our six infected macaques. In the two SIVmac239 animals (M154 and N361) CD4+ T-cell counts, after infection, declined rapidly and progressively, reaching a nadir of ∼100 cells/μl (Fig. 2C). Both macaques developed pneumonia, anorexia, and weight loss at 4 and 7 months after infection, respectively, and had to be euthanized. By comparison, although CD4+ T-cell counts also fell initially, the four SIVtat1ex animals did much better. Two SIVtat1ex animals (N200 and L882) stabilized their CD4+ T-cell counts to between 250 and 500 cells/μl; the other two SIVtat1ex animals (L840 and L855), after an initial decline, raised their CD4 counts to approximately ≥1000 cells/μlbythe fourth week of infection (Fig. 2D). The clinical courses were also significantly better in the SIVtat1ex group. Although L882 did have weight loss, thrombocytopenia, and anemia after 9 months and was euthanized at the 10th month after infection secondary to severe respiratory distress, the other three SIVtat1ex macaques did well. N200 had stable CD4+ T-cell count of ∼500 cells/μl and remained healthy for more than 2 years after infection. L840 and L855 had long term control of viremia and stable CD4 counts for more than 1 year; both remained clinically well more than 3 years after infection. Thus, all four SIVtat1ex animals did better than their SIV-mac239 counterparts, and three of the four SIVtat1ex macaques survived well beyond the demise of both SIVmac239 animals. Rapid Change of 1-Exon Tat to 2-Exon Tat Prognosticates a Poor Clinical Outcome—413 days into our study, we observed a sudden rise in viral load in animal L855 (Fig. 3A), which was accompanied by a precipitous drop in CD4 cell count (Fig. 3B). This contrasted with a largely unchanged viral load and stable CD4 cell count in the companion L840 animal. We were puzzled by the sudden divergence in the presentations of L882 and L855 and sought to understand whether the virus in one of these two animals might have changed to the more pathogenic two exon Tat-encoding SIVmac239. To address the question of virus reversion from SIVtat1ex to SIVmac239, we carefully examined plasma viral RNAs collected serially from all four SIVtat1ex animals, N200, L855, L882, and L840 (Table I). tat sequence in the viral RNAs was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR, cloned into plasmid vectors, and sequenced. Proviral DNA was sequenced only a single time (i.e. the final L840 time point; Table I) when viral RNA inexplicably could not be amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR. For each time point, the status of the tat stop codons was determined from several independent clones. (Note: the denominator in Table I indicates the number of clones sequenced; the numerator represents the number of clones with the indicated sequence at codons 96 and 97. SIVtat1ex commenced with the TGA TAA sequence at positions 96 and 97).Table ITat codons 96 and 97 in SIVtat1ex infected animal over timeDayN200L855L882L84035TGA TAA 11/1142TGA TAA 6/6TGA TAA 4/7 TGA TAG 3/7TGA TAA 19/24 TCA TAA 5/24TGA TAG 3/5 TGA TAA 2/556TGA TAA 7/7TCA TCA 8/8127TGA TAG 7/7TGA TAG 5/5TCA TCA 4/5 TCA TTA 1/5TGA TAG 6/11 TCA AA 5/11156TGA TAG 5/5TCA TCA 7/12 TGA TAG 4/12 TCA TAA 1/12184TGA TAG 5/5TCA TGA 7/15 TGA TAG 8/15TCA TAA 10/14 TGA TAA 2/14 TGA TCA 1/14 TCA TCA 1/14212TCA TCA 4/4268TGA TAG 4/4TCA TCA 7/8 TCA TCG 1/8TCA TCA 7/8 TCA TAA 1/8352TGA TAG 10/10413TGA TAG 10/10TCA CGA 8/12 TCA CAA 1/12 TGA TAG 3/12TCA TCA 7/10 TGA TCA 1/10 TGA TAG 1/10485TGA TAG 5/5TGA TAG 4/5 TCA TCA 1/1609TCA CGA 8/10 TCA CCA 1/10 TGA TAG 1/10667TGA TAG 10/10773TGA TAG 1/1955TGA TCA 5/6 TGA TAA 1/6TCA CCA 12/121386TGA TAG 7/10TCA TCA 3/10 Open table in a new tab In all SIVtat1ex animals, stop codons at positions 96 and 97 were maintained through the first 4 weeks of infection. Interestingly, as early as day 56, one SIVtat1ex animal, L882, had reverted both stop codons, opening them in eight of eight sequenced clones. This stop-codon-opening was bona fide reversion and not sample contamination since the reverted amino acids at 96 and 97, Ser-Ser, were different from the wild-type amino acids, Ala-Ser. Indeed, this rapid change from SIVtat1ex to SIVmac239 in L882 apparently explains its SIVmac239-like (i.e. M154- and N361-like) demise at the 10th month after infection. Hence, a revised interpretation of the comparative courses in the six animals is that three out of three original/rapidly reverted SIVmac239 animals (i.e. M154, N361, L882) uniformly succumbed to disease/death by the 10th month of infection, whereas three out of three SIVtat1ex animals (i.e. N200, L855, L840) remained clinically well more than 2 years after infection. Other than L882, the three remaining SIVtat1ex animals, N200, L855, L840, maintained firmly both Tat stop codons through the first year of infection. Nevertheless, a detailed perusal of their sequence results was informative. For example, the opening of the stop codons in L855 (i.e. 9 out of 12 clones opened) by day 413 temporally correlated with its rise in viral load and concomitant decline in CD4+ cell count (Fig. 3; Table I). When considered with the outcomes observed for M154 and N361 (SIVmac239 animals) and L882 (a rapid revertant to SIVmac239), the L855 finding supports that a change from one-exon Tat- to two-exon Tat-encoded virus is likely causative in vivo of increased viral load and decreased CD4 cell counts. A second set of instructive findings was seen in the SIVtat1ex animal L840. Early after infection, L840 had low viral loads and high CD4+ cell counts (Fig. 3). Interestingly, when sequence data were examined, by day 268 after infection, L840 presented evidence for attempted reversions to SIV-mac239, opening both stop codons in seven out of eight sequenced clones (Table I). Curiously, unlike L882, the in vivo attempt of L840 to mutate from SIVtat1ex to SIVmac239 failed to succeed durably. Indeed, when day 485 viral RNAs were sequenced, L840 again showed an in vivo dominant SIVtat1ex virus (i.e. four out of five clones had the TGA-TAG sequence; Table I). We note that unlike the finding for L885, where mutation of SIVtat1ex virus to SIVmac239 occurred in the face of rising viral load and falling CD4 counts, the re-emergence of SIVtat1ex virus in L840 occurred in a setting of low viral load and high CD4+ cell counts (Fig. 3). One interpretation is that the L840 immune system succeeded (where L855 failed) in selecting against the more potently replicating SIVmac239 virus, permitting the re-emergence of the less potent, but immune unselected, SIVtat1ex virus. Indeed, to date, after more than 1500 cumulative days of infection, L840 remains clinically healthy with a normal CD4+ T-cell count and a low viral load (∼2000 copies/ml). Taken together, our collective data are fully compatible with the notion that SIV that expresses the 2-exon form of Tat is better than its 1-exon counterpart in in vivo replication/pathogenesis. Cellular Immune Response Directed to the Second Coding Exon of Tat Is Found in L840 —The different outcomes in L882, L855, and L840 to nascent reversions of SIVtat1ex to SIV-mac239 prompted us to consider whether differential immune responses (i.e. CTL) to the second coding exon of Tat might explain the varying courses. We assessed CTL activity using a γ-interferon ELISPOT assay (29Amara R.R. Villinger F. Altman J.D. Lydy S.L. O'Neil S.P. Staprans S.I. Montefiori D.C. Xu Y. Herndon J.G. Wyatt L. Candido M.A. Kozyr N.L. Earl P.L. Smith J.M. Ma H.L. Grimm B.D. Hulsey M.L. Miller J. McClure H.M. McNicholl J.M. Moss B. Robinson H.L. Science. 2001; 292: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). In this assay, PBMCs, which had been cryopreserved, were stimulated with two pools of peptides from the second coding exon of Tat. The number of cells, which were stimulated by peptides to produce γ-interferon, was counted based on in situ immunological detection of spots of cells affixed to membrane. We were limited in this analysis by the fact that we did not successfully anticipate the serial cryopreservation of PBMC samples from all animals. Hence, a complete comparison of CTL responses could not be performed. Nevertheless, in limited side-by-side comparisons of successfully preserved PBMCs from M154, N361, L855, L882, L840, and N200 at ∼6 months after infection, we found that L882 had the worst, whereas L840 had the best, cellular responses to two different pools of Tat second coding exon peptides (Fig. 4A). The results are compatible with the idea that an effective CTL directed to the second coding exon of Tat in L840 selected against the nascent transition (day 268; Table I) of SIVtat1ex to the better replicating SIVmac239, permitting the re-emergence by day 485 (Table I) of SIVtat1ex (which is not selected against by CTLs specific for the second coding exon of Tat). The less robust CTL responses in L882 and L855 were apparently insufficient to control SIVmac239, hence allowing for nascent forms of the better replicating SIVmac239 to quickly dominate in vivo. The cellular response of L840 to the second exon of SIV-mac239 Tat was further independently verified using intracellular cytokine staining. Intracellular cytokine staining was performed after stimulation of L840 PBMCs with peptides from the second exon of Tat. The cells were stained with an anti-TNFα antibody and then analyzed by flow cytomtery (Fig. 4B). The results suggest that L840 has CTL activity against two epitopes in"

In this study, we analyzed the roles for STAT3 in the growth and differentiation of myoblasts in terms of cell cycle regulation and interaction with MyoD using C2C12 cells. Here we found that STAT3 inhibited myogenic differentiation induced by low serum or MyoD as efficiently as the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. As for this mechanism, we found that STAT3 not only promoted cell cycle progression through the induction of c-myc but also inhibited MyoD activities through direct interaction. STAT3 inhibited not only DNA binding activities of MyoD but also its transcriptional activities. However, the inhibited transcriptional activities were restored by the supplement of p300/CBP and PCAF, suggesting that STAT3 might deprive MyoD of these transcriptional cofactors. In addition, we found that MyoD inhibited DNA binding activities of STAT3, thereby inhibiting STAT3-dependent cell growth and survival of Ba/F3 cells. These results suggest that the development of muscle cells is regulated by the coordination of cytokine signals and intrinsic transcription factors.

These results suggest that the development of muscle cells is regulated by the coordination of cytokine signals and intrinsic transcription factors. Skeletal muscle develops from pluripotent mesodermal stem cells through a multistep process including the commitment to myogenic precursors and the subsequent proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. In the differentiation step, myoblasts exit from cell cycle, begin to express muscle-specific genes, and fuse with adjacent myoblasts to form multinucleated, differentiated myotubes (1Rawls A. Olson E.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, the maintenance and rapid regeneration after injury in adult muscle are solely dependent on a unique group of cells called satellite cells (or adult myoblasts) that are located under the basal lamina of the muscle fiber and kept quiescent in uninjured muscle. In these systems, the commitment, migration, growth, and differentiation of myoblasts are regulated by variety of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IL, interleukin; OSM, oncostatin M; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; WT, wild type; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CBP, CREB binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; G-CSFR, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor; FL, full length; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DM, differentiation medium; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; BR, basic region; H-L-H, helix-loophelix; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ED, estradiol.1The abbreviations used are: IGF, insulin-like growth factor; LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IL, interleukin; OSM, oncostatin M; MEF, myocyte enhancer factor; MRF, myogenic regulatory factor; WT, wild type; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CBP, CREB binding protein; PCAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; G-CSFR, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor; FL, full length; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; DM, differentiation medium; 4-HT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; BR, basic region; H-L-H, helix-loophelix; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ED, estradiol.-I, IGF-II, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-α (3Husmann I. Soulet L. Gautron J. Martelly I. Barritault D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Among these factors, IGF-I is considered to be especially important for muscle development, because mice that lacked the IGF-I receptor exhibited marked muscle hypoplasia and died soon after birth because of their inability to breathe (4Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar). In mice lacking the HGF receptor c-met, the limb bud and diaphragm were not colonized by myogenic precursor cells, and as a consequence, skeletal muscles of the limb and diaphragm were not formed (5Bladt F. Riethmacher D. Isenmann S. Aguzzi A. Birchmeier C. Nature. 1995; 376: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are transcription factors that transduce pivotal biological effects of various cytokines and hormones (6Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). Among seven STAT family members (STAT1–4, 5A, 5B, and 6), STAT3 is activated by several cytokines, such as the IL (interleukin)-6 family of cytokines (LIF, ciliary neurotrophic factor, oncostatin M (OSM), IL-11, and cardiotrophin-1), IGF-I, HGF, epidermal growth factor, PDGF, and bFGF, and plays central roles in the regulation of growth, differentiation, and survival in various types of cells (7Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). For example, STAT3 promotes cell growth through the transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 in fibroblasts (8Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C.

In contrast, STAT3 also mediates cytokine-induced terminal differentiation in other cell types, e.g. IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation (13Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M.

Therefore, functional roles for STAT3 in cell growth and differentiation are supposed to be entirely divergent according to the cellular background and/or type of cytokine. Although STAT3 is activated by various growth factors that regulate the growth and differentiation of myoblasts (18Megeney L.A. Perry R.L. LeCouter J.E. Rudnicki M.A. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Simon A.R. Takahashi S. Severgnini M. Fanburg B.L. Cochran B.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15099-15105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), its role in myogenesis still remains largely unknown. The intrinsic muscle-specific transcriptional factors, such as the MyoD family and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) family proteins, also play crucial roles in skeletal muscle development in coordination with exogenous growth factors (21Olson E.N. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix (H-L-H) transcription factors, also referred to as myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs), includes MyoD, myogenin, Myf5, and MRF4 (for reviews, see Refs. 2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar and 22Wei Q. Paterson B.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Myf5 and MyoD impose a myogenic fate on pluripotent precursor cells and induce differentiation at an earlier step, whereas myogenin and MRF4 act at a later step. These factors form heterodimers with ubiquitously expressed E-protein family members (E12/47, E2-2, E2-5, and HEB), bind to a consensus DNA sequence called an E-box, and regulate the expression of several muscle-specific genes and cell cycle regulatory genes. MyoD induces the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 and Rb, which are considered to be responsible for MyoD-induced cell cycle exit (a prerequisite condition for the initiation of myogenic differentiation) (23Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach G.J. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 24Martelli F. Cenciarelli C. Santarelli C. Polikar B. Felsani A. Caruso M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3579-3590PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that MyoD would cause cell cycle arrest through its transcriptional activities. However, it was also reported that MyoD induces cell cycle arrest independently of its DNA binding activities, because MyoD carrying the mutation in the basic (DNA-binding) region inhibited cell growth as efficiently as wild-type (WT) MyoD (25Crescenzi M. Fleming T.P. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8442-8446Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 26Sorrentino V. Pepperkok R. Davis R.L. Ansorge W. Philipson L. Nature. 1990; 345: 813-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). With regard to this mechanism, MyoD was shown to directly interact with Rb and to inhibit its phosphorylation induced by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), thereby inducing cell cycle arrest (2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 22Wei Q. Paterson B.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, MyoD directly binds to MEF2 (MEF2A, C, or D) and enhances MEF2-dependent transcription (i.e. the transcription dependent on the DNA binding of MEF2) through its own transcriptional activities, and vice versa, which results in the cooperative enhancement of MEF2- and MyoD-dependent myogenic differentiation (27Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Cell. 1995; 83: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Moreover, MyoD activities are positively or negatively regulated by the direct interactions with p300/CBP, PCAF, CDK4, MEK1, and Twist (2Sabourin L.A. Rudnicki M.A. Clin. Genet. 2000; 57: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 22Wei Q. Paterson B.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Perry R.L. Parker M.H. Rudnicki. M.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 291-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate that MyoD would regulate myogenic differentiation through its transcriptional activities and protein-protein interactions. In this study, we analyzed the roles for STAT3 in the growth and differentiation of myoblasts and examined its interaction with MyoD using C2C12 (C2) cells. Here we found that STAT3 inhibits myogenic differentiation induced by low serum or MyoD as efficiently as the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. As for this mechanism, we found that STAT3 not only induces the expression of c-myc but also reciprocally antagonizes MyoD through the direct interaction. These results suggest that STAT3 would regulate the development of skeletal muscle in combination with other signaling pathways such as Ras/MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through cell cycle regulation and modification of MyoD activities.

Ba/F3, an IL-3-dependent cell line engineering G-CSFR/gp130, Ba/F3/GR/gp130 was cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml of gp130L. Flow Cytometry—Surface expression of gp130 and G-CSFR/gp130 was examined by an indirect method using FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA). DNA content of cultured cells was quantitated by propidium iodide staining. Cell cycle analysis was performed with the Modfit LT2.0 program (Becton Dickinson). Northern Blot Analysis—The methods for the isolation of total cellular RNA and Northern blot were described previously (35Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis and Immunoblotting—293T cells were transfected with various expression vectors by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. After 36 h, total cellular lysates were isolated and subjected to immunoprecipitation, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting as described previously (30Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y.

The transfected clones were selected by culture with G418 (1 mg/ml) and/or puromycin (1 μg/ml) according to the transfected plasmid used. Luciferase Assays—Luciferase assays were performed with a Dual-Luciferase System (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (36Matsumura I. Kitamura T. Wakao H. Tanaka H. Hashimoto K. Albanese C.

In short, C2 or C3 cells (2× 105 cells seeded in a 60-mm dish) were transfected with the indicated effector genes along with 2 μg of a reporter gene for STAT3 (4× APRE-Luc) (13Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y.

After 12 h, the cells were washed, serum-deprived for 24 h, and subjected to cell lysis. After the measurement of firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, the relative firefly luciferase activities were calculated by normalizing transfection efficiency according to the Renilla luciferase activities. The experiments were performed in triplicate, and similar results were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The isolation of nuclear extracts and EMSA were performed as described previously (35Matsumura I. Ishikawa J. Nakajima K. Oritani K. Tomiyama Y. Miyagawa J. Kato T. Miyazaki H. Matsuzawa Y. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The sequences of the probes were as follows: IR, 5′-GCGTGATTTCCCCGAAATGATGAGGCA-3′ for STAT3 (13Nakajima K. Yamanaka Y. Nakae K. Kojima H. Ichiba M. Kiuchi N. Kitaoka T. Fukada T. Hibi M. Hirano T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3651-3658Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar); and E-box, 5′-CCCCCAACAGCTGTTGCCTGA-3′ for MyoD. The recognition sequences are underlined. GST Pull-down Assays—The production and purification of GST-STAT3 fusion proteins were performed as reported previously (30Tanaka H. Matsumura I. Ezoe S. Satoh Y. Sakamaki T. Albanese C. Machii T. Pestell R.G. Kanakura Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled MyoD was prepared by a TNT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). In each binding reaction, 20 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with 50 μg of TNT reaction solution at 4 °C for 1 h. The binding complexes were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to autoradiography. GAL4 Transactivation Assays—To construct GAL4-MyoD fusion constructs, various PCR fragments of MyoD were subcloned into the pBIND vector that contains the DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1 to 147) of GAL4 (Promega). The expression vector for GAL4-MyoD was transfected into C2 cells together with pG5-Luc, a luciferase reporter gene containing five copies of the GAL4-binding sequence (Promega), with or without the effector gene as indicated. Luciferase assays were performed as described above. Effects of gp130L on the Growth and Differentiation of C2 and C3 Cells—C2 cells usually maintained in the growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum are known to undergo differentiation under culture with low (0.1%) serum (differentiation medium, DM). Also, MyoD/ER (a chimera consisting of full-length MyoD and the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor) was reported to induce differentiation in response to ED in C3 (29Cenciarelli C. De Santa F. Puri P.L. Mattei E. Ricci L. Bucci F. Felsani A. Caruso M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5203-5217Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 38Hollenberg S.M. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8028-8032Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To examine the roles for STAT3, which can be activated by LIF, IL-6, IGF-I, HGF, PDGF, or bFGF, in myogenic differentiation under these culture systems, we introduced MyoD/ER and G-CSFR/gp130 (a chimeric receptor composed of the extracellular domain of G-CSFR and the cytoplasmic domain of gp130) that can activate STAT3 into C2 and C3; these clones were designated as C2/gp130/MyoD/ER and C3/gp130/MyoD/ER, respectively. We did not detect the expression of endogenous G-CSFR on C2/gp130/MyoD/ER (data not shown) and found that G-CSFR/gp130 was expressed at a similar level to endogenous gp130 with flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 1A). Also, the equivalent level of G-CSFR/gp130 expression was detectable on C3/gp130/MyoD/ER (data not shown). When C2/gp130/MyoD/ER cells (in an ∼40% confluent state) were cultured with DM or treated with ED without gp130L (in this report, we denote G-CSF as gp130 ligand (gp130L) when it acts on G-CSFR/gp130), the mRNA expression of myogenin and myosin light chain 3 was induced during culture with DM or by ED treatment. Although G-CSF by itself did not show any effects on parental C2 cells although used at a high concentration (300 ng/ml)(data not shown), it inhibited DM- or MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation through the activation of the chimeric receptor G-CSFR/gp130 in C2/gp130/MyoD/ER cells (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that natural ligands for gp130, i.e. LIF and IL-6, could inhibit both DM- and MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation in C2/gp130/MyoD/ER cells (Fig. 1B). gp130L also significantly suppressed the ED-induced expression of myogenin in C3/gp130/MyoD/ER cells, indicating that gp130-mediated signals would inhibit both DM- and MyoD-induced myogenic differentiation in C2 and C3 cells. Next, we analyzed cell cycle profiles in these clones before and after 72-h cultures (Fig. 1C). When C2/gp130/MyoD/ER cells were cultured with DM or treated with ED for 72 h in the absence of gp130L, the proportion of proliferating cells in S-G2/M phase decreased severely in both cultures (the proportion of S-G2/M phase: 48% growth medium versus 5% DM, 12% ED). However, gp130L and LIF restored their growth significantly (gp130L, 21% DM, 28% ED; LIF, 13% DM, 20% ED). gp130L, at least in part, canceled the ED-induced growth suppression in C3/gp130/MyoD/ER cells (the change in the proportion of S-G2/M phase: from 11% to 22%) (Fig. 1C). Effects of STAT3 and Raf/MAPK on the Growth and Differentiation of C2 Cells—To clarify the mechanism by which gp130L inhibited DM- and ED-induced differentiation and restored growth in C2 cells, we explored the roles for its downstream signaling molecules. Because gp130L is known to activate STAT3 and Ras/MAPK in other cell types (9Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 31Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), we examined whether these molecules are activated by gp130L in C2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the immunoblot analyses showed that gp130L induced the phosphorylation (i.e. activation) of STAT3 and MAPK in C2/gp130/MyoD/ER cells. To determine the roles for STAT3 and Ras/MAPK in the growth and differentiation of C2 cells, we further expressed 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT)-inducible forms of STAT3 and Raf (STAT3/ERT and Raf/ERT) in C2/gp130/MyoD/ER; these clones were designated as C2/MyoD/ER/STAT3/ERT and C2/MyoD/ER/Raf/ERT, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2B, both DM and ED induced the expression of myogenin in C2/MyoD/ER/STAT3/ERT cells under culture without 4-HT, whereas the expression of myogenin was reduced to an undetectable level by the 4-HT treatment (Fig. 2B). In addition, DNA content analysis showed that the 4-HT treatment significantly restored both DM- and ED-induced growth suppression in this clone (changes in the proportion of S-G2/M phase: DM, from 6% to 14%; ED, from 12% to 18%) (Fig. 2C, left panel). 4-HT-activated c-Raf also reduced the ED-induced expression of myogenin in C2/MyoD/ER/Raf/ERT cells (data not shown), which was accompanied by an increase of the proliferating cells (changes in the proportion of S+G2/M phase: DM, from 5% to 16%; ED from 12% to 19%) (Fig. 2C, right panel). Similar data were obtained from at least five clones each expressing STAT3/ERT or Raf/ERT (data not shown). c-Myc Can Inhibit DM-induced but not MyoD-induced Differentiation in C2 Cells—Because both STAT3 and Ras/MAPK are known to mediate cell growth through the induction of c-myc (9Kiuchi N. Nakajima K. Ichiba M. Fukada T. Narimatsu M. Mizuno K. Hibi M. Hirano T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 39Kerkhoff E. Houben R. Loffler S. Troppmair J. Lee J.E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we examined the effects of STAT3 and c-Raf on the expression of c-myc mRNA in C2 by Northern blot analysis. In the absence of 4-HT, the expression of c-myc declined under culture with DM or ED in C2/MyoD/ER/STAT3/ERT and C2/MyoD/ER/Raf/ERT cells, whereas the 4-HT treatment retained its expression in both clones for up to 72 h (Fig. 2D). This result raised the possibility that both STAT3 and c-Raf might promote cell growth and inhibit DM- and ED-induced differentiation through c-myc. To test this possibility, we stably expressed a 4-HT-inducible form of c-Myc, Myc/ERT, in C2/gp130/MyoD/ER. When these clones were cultured with 4-HT, c-Myc inhibited the DM-induced but not ED-induced expression of myogenin (a representative result is shown in Fig. 2E). These results implied that cell cycle progression driven by c-Myc is sufficient to overcome DM-induced differentiation but not MyoD-induced differentiation in C2 cells. In addition, it was speculated that both STAT3 and c-Raf would inhibit MyoD-induced differentiation independently of c-myc induction. As a matter of fact, with regard to c"

Intrabodies have been used to specifically target intracellular proteins, manipulate biological processes, and contribute to the understanding of their functions as well as for the generation of phenotypic knockouts in vivo by surface depletion of extracellular or transmembrane proteins. In order to study the biological consequences of knocking down two receptor-tyrosine kinases, we developed a novel intrabody-based strategy. Here we describe the design, engineering, and characterization of a bispecific, tetravalent endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted intradiabody for simultaneous surface depletion of two endothelial transmembrane receptors, Tie-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGF-R2). Comparison of the ER-targeted intradiabody with the corresponding conventional ER-targeted single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) intrabodies demonstrated that the intradiabody is significantly more efficient with respect to efficiency and duration of surface depletion of Tie-2 and VEGF-R2. In vitro endothelial cell tube formation assays suggest that the bispecific intradiabody exhibits strong antiangiogenic activity, whereas the effect of the monospecific scFv intrabodies was weaker. These findings suggest that simultaneous interference with the VEGF and the Tie-2 receptor pathways results in at least additive antiangiogenic effects, which may have implications for future drug developments.

The potential of single-chain antibody fragments (scFv) 1The abbreviations used are: scFvsingle-chain antibody fragmentERendoplasmatic reticulumHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsAng-1 or -2angiopoietin-1 or -2VHheavy chain variable domainVLlight chain variable domainVEGFvascular endothelial growth factorELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayPBSphosphate-buffered salineHAhemagglutininMOImultiplicity of infectionFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingGFPgreen fluorescent protein. for intracellular applications, termed “intrabodies,” has been exploited in a number of laboratories (1Marasco W.A.

Bispecific and tetravalent antibody fragments could improve and expand the inhibitory potential of intrabodies by exhibiting increased apparent affinity for their antigen and by being more efficient at inhibiting protein function or intracellular trafficking (9Fitzgerald K. Hooliger P. Winter G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1221-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Intrabodies present a potent alternative to methods of gene inactivation that target at the level of DNA or mRNA, such as antisense (10Wagner R.W. Flanagan W.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1997; 3: 31-38Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), zinc finger proteins (11Beerli R.R. Barbas III, C.F. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), targeted gene disruption, or the relatively new RNA interference (12Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (3543) Google Scholar). Operating at the posttranslational level, intrabodies can be directed to relevant subcellular compartments and precise epitopes on target proteins (2Beerli R.R. Wels W. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23931-23936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Marasco W.A. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14Bai J. Sui J. Zhu R.Y.

Numerous studies have reported the development of engineering antibodies that are both multispecific and multivalent (15Todorovska A. Roovers R.C. Dolezal O. Kortt A.A. Hoogenboom H.R. Hudson P. J. Immunol. Methods. 2001; 248: 47-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Hudson P. Souriau C. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Applying this knowledge, the goal of our study was to develop an ER-targeted intrabody format for the simultaneous down-regulation of two independent cell surface receptors, in order to investigate the biological consequences of knocking down two receptor-tyrosine kinases. To accomplish this, an ER-targeted tetravalent antibody construct, with dual specificity, was generated. Using a recombinant adenovirus as gene delivery system, we could show that this intrabody construct, termed here an “intradiabody,” was expressed in the ER and able to trap both targeted proteins in the same compartment. The intradiabody targets the endothelial transmembrane receptors Tie-2 and VEGF-R2, which are essential for angiogenesis. The interplay of VEGF, VEGF-R2, Tie-2, and Ang-1 and -2 has been suggested as a key modulator in the onset of tumor angiogenesis (17Holash J. Maisonpierre P.C. Compton D. Boland P. Alexander C.R. Zagzag D. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Science. 1999; 284: 1994-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (1915) Google Scholar). According to this model, Tie-2 is constitutively engaged with Ang-1 in quiescent blood vessels. The Tie-2/Ang-1 complex stabilizes quiescent blood vessels by promoting their interaction with surrounding perivascular cells, smooth muscle cells, and the extracellular matrix. The constitutive Tie-2/ Ang-1 complex is antagonized by Ang-2, which is up-regulated in endothelial cells that are proximal to the tumor. By competing with Ang-1 for Tie-2 binding, Ang-2 destabilizes the interaction of endothelial cells and their microenvironment. This is thought to sensitize the endothelial cells to VEGF signaling. Thus, Ang-2 produced by endothelial cells promotes tumor angiogenesis in concert with VEGF produced by the tumor. Comparison of the effect of the intradiabody (targeting Tie-2 and VEGF-R2) with the corresponding conventional scFv intrabodies (targeting Tie-2 or VEGF-R2 alone) revealed a remarkable superiority of the intradiabody, as represented by a complete and extended surface depletion of both Tie-2 and VEGF-R2. This finding can be attributed to the extended half-life of our intradiabody, as determined by pulse-chase studies. In addition, we show that the intradiabody strongly inhibits endothelial tube formation beyond that seen with inhibitors of either receptor-tyrosine kinase alone, thus confirming its antiangiogenic properties. Our results confirm that the inhibition of the VEGF receptor pathway cannot be compensated by the Tie-2 pathway, nor vice versa (18Siemeister G. Schirner M. Weindel K. Reusch P. Menrad A. Marme D. Martiny-Baron G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3185-3191PubMed Google Scholar), but also demonstrates that targeting both pathways simultaneously results in additive antiangiogenic effects in vitro. Combining the specific and high affinity binding properties of our intradiabody with its ability to be stably expressed in the ER, we identified a very effective intrabody format for the simultaneous functional knockout of two cell surface receptors. single-chain antibody fragment endoplasmatic reticulum human umbilical vein endothelial cells angiopoietin-1 or -2 heavy chain variable domain light chain variable domain vascular endothelial growth factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin multiplicity of infection fluorescence-activated cell sorting green fluorescent protein. Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in EGM medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 2% bovine brain extract (BioWhittaker). 293 cells (human embryonic kidney) (ATCC) cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% antibiotics. Library Generation and Selection—The generation and selection of rabbit/human chimeric Fab libraries, as well as the characterization of positive Fabs, were done essentially as described (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar, 20Popkov M. Mage R.G. Alexander C.B. Thundivalappil S. Barbas III, C.F. Rader C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In brief, rabbit Vκ-, Vλ-, and VH-encoding sequences were amplified from first strand cDNA and fused to human Cκ- and CH1-encoding sequences, respectively, followed by assembly of chimeric rabbit/human light chain- and Fd fragment-encoding sequences and by asymmetric SfiI cloning into phagemid vector pComb3X. Libraries were panned against VEGF-R2/VEGF complex immobilized on Costar 3690 96-well ELISA plates (Corning, Acton, PA). Four rounds of panning (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar, 21Rader C. Ritter G. Nathan S. Elia M. Gout I. Jungbluth A.A.

To eliminate the selection of clones that bind to the human IgG1 Fc part of the recombinant human VEGF-R2/Fc fusion protein, 2.5 mg/ml human IgG (Pierce) was added to the phage preparations during selection. After the final round of panning, 10 isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced clones from each library were analyzed for binding to 100 ng of immobilized VEGF-R2, human IgG, and bovine serum albumin by ELISA using a rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for detection. Positive clones were analyzed by DNA fingerprinting and sequencing as described before (20Popkov M. Mage R.G. Alexander C.B. Thundivalappil S. Barbas III, C.F. Rader C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Soluble Fab were expressed from gene III fragment-depleted phagemid vector pComb3X and purified using goat anti-human F(ab′)2N-hydroxysuccinimide resin columns as described (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar). Library generation and selection for Tie-2 clones is described elsewhere (20Popkov M. Mage R.G. Alexander C.B. Thundivalappil S. Barbas III, C.F. Rader C. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For a control construct, designated T2V2, one clone was selected from each generated library (VEGF-R2 and Tie-2) prior to selection. ELISA was done the same way as for detection of binders after panning, determining no binding to VEGF-R2 or Tie-2. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Surface plasmon resonance for the determination of association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants for the interaction of chimeric rabbit/human Fab with Tie-2 was performed on a Biacore instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). A CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) was activated for immobilization with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to the methods outlined by the supplier. Recombinant human VEGF-R2/Fc fusion protein was coupled at a low density (500–1000 resonance units) to the surface by injection of 10–20 μl of a 10 ng/μl sample in 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.5). Subsequently, the sensor chip was deactivated with 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.5). Binding of chimeric rabbit/human Fab to immobilized human VEGF-R2 was studied by injection of Fab at five different concentrations ranging from 50 to 150 nm. PBS was used as the running buffer. The sensor chip was regenerated with 20 mm HCl and remained active for at least 20 measurements. The kon and koff values were calculated using Biacore AB evaluation software. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd was calculated from koff/kon. Conversion of a VEGF-R2 and a Tie-2-specific Fab into a Single-chain Antibody Fragment (scFv)—Specific oligonucleotide primers (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar, 22Rader C. Popkov M. Neves J.A. Barbas III, C.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 2000-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were used to amplify VH and VL gene segments from purified phagemid DNA of Fab VC06 and Fab 1S05. VL of VC06 and 1S05 were amplified with extompseq (5′-GCG GAG GAG CTT GCT AGC TGC GAG AAG ACA GCT ATC GCG ATT GCA TGT) and RJλO-BL. VH of VC06 and 1S05 were amplified with RSCVH4 or RSCVH3, respectively, and HSCG1234-B. Overlap extension PCR was done using primers ext and RSC-B. The resulting overlap-PCR product encodes an scFv in which the C-terminal VL region is linked to the N-terminal VH region through a peptide linker (SSGGGGSGGGGGGSSRSS). Control construct JC7U (against integrin αvβ3) was constructed as described (22Rader C. Popkov M. Neves J.A. Barbas III, C.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 2000-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The scFv encoding sequences were cloned into phagemid vector pComb3X using asymmetric SfiI sites and binding activity of the expressed scFv was confirmed by ELISA. Cloning of Diabodies and Corresponding scFv—The scFv 1S05 and VC06 genes were linked through the second and third heavy chain constant domains of human IgG1 to generate a bispecific diabody. ScFv 1S05 was PCR-amplified using extompseq and Tie-2-B (5′-GCC AGA CCC ACC GCC TCT AGA TGA GGA GAC GGT GAC CAG GGT G-3′). CH2-CH3 was amplified using CH2-F (5′-TCT AGA GGC GGT GGG TCT GGC GGG GGC TCG-3′) and CH3-B (5′-CGA CTG AGT CAG CAC GAG CTC GGC CGC CTG TGC CGA GCC ACC CCC AGA ACC-3′). ScFv VC06 was amplified using VEGF-R2-F (5′-TCT CCG GGT GGC GCG CCT GGT GGC GGT TCT GGC GGT GGT TCT GGG GGT GGC TCG GCA CAG GCG GCC GAG CTC GTG CTG ACT CAG TCG CCC TC-3′) and dpseq (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar). ScFv 1S05 and CH2-CH3 were combined by overlap extension PCR using primer ext (22Rader C. Popkov M. Neves J.A. Barbas III, C.F. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 2000-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and CH3-B. ScFv VC06 was SacI/SpeI-cloned into phagemid vector pComb3X. Finally, both constructs were combined by SacI cloning and confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The T2 scFv was amplified using primers extompseq and T2-B (5′-GCC AGA CCC ACC GCC TCT AGA TGA GGA GAC GGT GAC CAG-3′), CH2-CH3 was amplified with primers CH2/T2-F (5′-TCT AGA GGC GGT GGG TCT GGC GGG GGC TCG-3′) and CH3/V2-B (5′-AGT CTG GGT CAT CAC GAG CTC GGC CGC CTG TGC CGA GCC ACC CCC AGA ACC-3′), and the scFv for V2 was amplified using dpseq and primer V2-F (5′-TCT GGG GGT GGC TCG GCA CAG GCG GCC GAG CTC GTG ATG ACC CAG ACT-3′). scFv T2 and CH2-CH3 were combined by overlap extension PCR using ext and CH3/V2-B. ScFv V2 was SacI/SpeI cloned into phagemid vector pComb3X. Both constructs were then combined in the same manner as the Tie-2/VEGF-R2 intrabody. Assembly of Intrabody Constructs in pAdTrackCMV and Generation of Adenoviral Plasmids by Homologous Recombination—Intrabody coding regions were initially assembled in pBabePuro essentially as described (23Steinberger P. Andris-Widhopf J. Buehler B. Torbett B.E. Barbas III, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 97: 805-810Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In these constructs, the scFv coding regions are flanked by a human κ light chain leader sequence at the 5′-end and a sequence encoding the HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) and the ER retention signal (KDEL) at the 3′-end. The intrabody coding regions were then excised by digestion with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pAdTrackCMV (24He T. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar) digested with BglII and SalI. This adapter fragment contains also compatible SfiI sites, which were used for cloning the different intrabodies (intradiabody against Tie-2/VEGF-R2, control intradiabody T2V2, scFv intrabody against Tie-2, and scFv intrabody against VEGF-R2) into the adenovirus vector. The generation of recombinant adenoviruses was done essentially as described (24He T. Zhou S. Da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). High titer viral stocks were produced and purified by CsCl banding. All virus preparations were GFP-corrected (25Hitt D.C. Booth J.L. Dandpani V. Pennington L.R. Gimble J.M. Metcalf J. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 14: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Infection of HUVEC with Intrabodies Using Recombinant Adenoviruses—1.5 × 106 HUVEC were infected with 10 MOI (∼80% of the cells were infected) of adenovirus encoding Tie-2/VEGF-R2-specific intradiabody, Tie-2-specific intrabody, VEGF-R2-specific intrabody, control intrabody, or no insert (mock). Tie-2 and VEGF-R2 expression of HUVEC cells was monitored for 15 days by flow cytometry. Flow Cytometry—HUVEC were washed once with Hepes-buffered saline solution, trypsinized, washed once with PBS, and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in FACS buffer (1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.03% (w/v) NaN3, 25 mm Hepes in PBS, pH 7.4). 105 cells were stained with biotinylated Tie-2 or VEFG-R2 polyclonal antibodies (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (1:200) in FACS buffer, followed by streptavidin-APC (1:100). Incubation times were 30 min at room temperature. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSort instrument from Becton-Dickinson measuring at FL4. For control purposes, cells were also stained with LM609 (αvβ3) and P1F6 (αvβ5) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and detected with biotinylated donkey anti-mouse antibody followed by streptavidin-APC. The formula for calculations of surface inhibition, after subtracting the background of normal goat IgG-stained cells was as follows: VEGF-R2GFP or Tie-2GFP minus VEGF-R2intrabody or Tie-2intrabody, divided by VEGF-R2GFP or Tie-2GFP. Immunocytochemical Analysis of Antigen/Intrabody Colocalization— For analysis of Tie-2, VEGF-R2, and intrabodies on GFP-positive HUVEC, cells were seeded on collagen-coated Lab-Tek coverglasses and infected with 50 MOI of adenovirus encoding intradiabody or control intrabody (JC7U). Forty-eight hours postinfection, HUVEC were washed with copious amounts of PBS, followed by incubation in a humidifying chamber at room temperature for 1 h with a primary antibody mixture of rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (5 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science) and biotinylated goat anti-human Tie-2 or anti-human VEGF-R2 polyclonal antibodies (R&D Systems). The cells were then stained for 1 h at room temperature with the mixture of Cy5-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG polyclonal antibodies and streptavidin/rhodamine red-X (both from Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) diluted to 1:100 in FACS buffer, 0.1% saponin. Finally, the cells were covered with SlowFade Antifade reagent. Three-color (GFP, rhodamine red-X, and Cy5) three-dimensional data sets were collected with a DeltaVision system (Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA); this consisted of an Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope, a motorized high precision xyz stage, a 100-watt mercury lamp, and a KAF1400 chip-based cooled chargecoupled device camera. Exposure times were 0.2–0.5 s (2-binning), and images were obtained with a ×60 oil objective. Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated by capturing 150-nm serial sections along the z axis. Images were deconvolved (based on the Agard-Sadat inverse matrix algorithm) and analyzed with softWorX version 2.5. Pulse-chase for Determination of Half-life—HUVEC cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells in T175 flasks and infected 24 h later with recombinant adenoviruses using an MOI of 10. After infection for 24 h, cells were washed with Hepes-buffered saline solution and trypsinized. Cells were starved for 2 h in 10 ml of serum-free, methionine-free, cysteine-free minimal essential medium at 37 °C and swirled periodically. Samples were then labeled with Tran35S-label medium (50 μCi/ml; ICN, Aurora, OH) for 2 h at 37 °C and subsequently chased with EGM medium, containing a 40-fold excess of methionine and 20-fold excess of cysteine for various time points (0, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48 h). At each time point, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and lysed (Promega lysis buffer, containing complete protease inhibitor mixture). Supernatants were collected and stored at –80 °C. Samples were precipitated using protein G and monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Covance) for scFv or protein G alone for the diabody. Immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with TBS, boiled in 1.5× SDS loading buffer, and separated by a 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. The gels were stained, dried, and exposed to autoradiography as well as quantitatively analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Endothelial Cell Tube Formation Assay—6 × 104 HUVEC cells were infected with recombinant adenovirus using an MOI of 20 in an Eppendorf tube for 45 min and were then transferred to 6-well plates. Three days after infection, cells were washed with Hepes-buffered saline solution, trypsinized, and counted. 2 × 104 cells/well (volume 50 μl) in complete EGM medium were seeded in triplicates for each virus in a 96-well plate coated with Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (BD Bioscience, Bedford, MA) and incubated for 15.5 h. Cells were then stained and fixed with the Diff-Quik® staining set (DADE BEHRING Inc., Newark, DE). For this, cells were fixed with Diff-Quik Fixative, followed by Diff-Quik Solution I and II, each with 100 μl for 2–3 min. Cells were then washed four times with distilled H2O, and pictures were taken under an inverted light microscope at ×2 magnification. The number of tube branches for each virus was counted in triplicates to calculate the average ± S.D. Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVEC cells were seeded (5 × 104) in 96-well plates in complete EGM medium and infected with different recombinant adenoviral constructs with an MOI of 10 and 50. Three days later, the cells were trypsinized, stained with trypan blue, and counted in triplicate by a hemacytometer. Cell proliferation was also measured by adding [3H]thymidine (ICN Radiochemicals) in a concentration of 0.5 μCi/well (1 Ci = 37 GBq) during the last 24 h of incubation. The cells were frozen at –80 °C overnight and subsequently processed on a multichannel automated cell harvester (Cambridge Technology, Cambridge, MA) and counted in a liquid scintillation β-counter (Beckman Coulter). The background was defined by uninfected cells. The inhibition was calculated according to the following formula: (background – infected cell count)/background × 100%. Selection of Rabbit Fabs Binding to VEGF-R2—Using phage display, several New Zealand White rabbit Fabs against VEGF-R2 were selected by panning (19Barbas III, C.F. Burton D.R. Scott J.K. Silverman G.J. Phage Display: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 9.1-9.113Google Scholar) chimeric rabbit/human antibody libraries (20Popkov M. Mage R.G.

For further analysis, chimeric rabbit/human Fab VC06 was selected and produced as soluble Fab in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography using goat anti-human F(ab′)2N-hydroxysuccinimide resin columns. Fab VC06 demonstrated a strong binding to human VEGF-R2 in ELISA and to HUVEC in flow cytometry (not shown). Thus, the VEGF-R2 epitope recognized by VC06 is displayed by native VEGF-R2 expressed on the cell surface and is an accessible target for antiangiogenic therapy. Surface plasmon resonance studies of VC06 revealed that it possessed a monovalent dissociation constant of ∼1 nm to human VEGF-R2, whereas Fab 1S05, which we described earlier (20Popkov M. Mage R.G. Alexander C.B. Thundivalappil S. Barbas III, C.F. Rader C. J. Mol.

Preserved binding to their respective antigens was confirmed for both scFv VC06 (VEGF-R2) and scFv 1S05 (Tie-2) by ELISA (not shown). Next, scFv 1S05 and scFv VC06 were linked through the second and third heavy chain constant domains of human IgG1, resulting in a scFv-CH2-CH3-scFv expression cassette. As a key feature, the scFv-CH2-CH3-scFv expression cassette provides for the production of a bifunctional tetravalent antibody construct from a single polypeptide. Through the homophilic interaction of CH3, two scFv-CH2-CH3-scFv molecules associate to form a 150-kDa dimer, which displays both the N-terminal and C-terminal scFv module bivalently as the intradiabody (Fig. 1).

We demonstrated that a treponemal membrane lipid inhibited PAMPs-induced immune responses. The chemical structure of the lipid was elucidated as a phosphatidylglycerol (PG) derivative, which is scarce in most mammalian tissues, but relatively abundant in treponemal membrane lipids. Natural and synthetic PG counterparts as well as related natural anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin, also demonstrated an inhibitory effect. Further, we noted that PG inhibited PAMPs-induced immune responses by blocking the binding of PAMPs with LBP and CD14. In addition, PG decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in serum of LPS-injected mice and depressed abscess formation in mice infected with treponemes. These results suggest that treponemal phospholipid interfere the function of LBP/CD14 and act as a modulator of innate immune responses.

The chemical structure of the lipid was elucidated as a phosphatidylglycerol (PG) derivative, which is scarce in most mammalian tissues, but relatively abundant in treponemal membrane lipids. Natural and synthetic PG counterparts as well as related natural anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and cardiolipin, also demonstrated an inhibitory effect. Further, we noted that PG inhibited PAMPs-induced immune responses by blocking the binding of PAMPs with LBP and CD14. In addition, PG decreased proinflammatory cytokine production in serum of LPS-injected mice and depressed abscess formation in mice infected with treponemes. These results suggest that treponemal phospholipid interfere the function of LBP/CD14 and act as a modulator of innate immune responses. The innate immune system plays essential roles in host defense against exposure to microorganisms.

Toll-like receptor (TLR), which is a type I transmembrane protein, has been implicated as the major receptor for PAMPs (1Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 14: 103-110Crossref Scopus (596) Google Scholar). To date, ten members of the TLR family have been described and some of their ligands identified. Among them, TLR4, in combination with its adapter molecule MD-2, has been shown to be the signaling receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is distributed on the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (2Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B.

Further, TLR9 has been reported to be involved in immune response to unmethylated CpG DNA (5Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5426) Google Scholar) and TLR3 has been identified as the receptor for double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (6Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4986) Google Scholar). TLRs recognize PAMPs through an extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain and activate signal transduction cascades via the cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1 receptor domain (7Medzhitov R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 1: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (3304) Google Scholar). The cascade involving cytoplasmic proteins, MyD88, IRAK, and TRAF6, activates NF-κB and leads to an expression of inflammatory mediator genes. In addition to TLRs, LPS-binding protein (LBP) and CD14 have been implicated in the recognition of some PAMPs. CD14 is found on the surface of innate immune cells as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein and in plasma in a soluble form (8Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar). It binds to some PAMPs, such as LPS (8Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar) and PGN (9Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). Further, LBP, which is an acute-phase protein found in plasma (11Tobias P.S. Soldau K. Ulevitch R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 777-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), increases the binding of soluble CD14 to LPS (8Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 249: 1431-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (3430) Google Scholar) and PGN (9Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Treponemes are anaerobic bacteria with a typical helical shape that have been associated with the induction of chronic human diseases, such as syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum (12Singh A.E. Romanowski B. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 12: 187-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and periodontal diseases caused by Treponema denticola (13Sela M.N. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 2001; 12: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Such chronic diseases are characterized by an inflammatory reaction induced by pathogens followed by extensive tissue loss. While treponemes lack LPS (14Fraser C.M. Norris S.J. Weinstock G.M White O. Sutton G.G. Dodson R. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Clayton R. Ketchum K.A. Sodergren E. Hardham J.M. McLeod M.P. Salzberg S.

Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar), their cell surface components have been shown to induce the synthesis of inflammatory mediators by host cells. The lipoproteins of treponemes have been shown to be potent virulent factors; i.e. the lipoproteins of T. pallidum (15Radolf J.D. Chamberlain N.R. Clausell A. Norgard M.V. Infect Immun. 1988; 56: 490-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) induce NF-κB translocation in monocytes (16Norgard M.V. Arndt L.L. Akins D.R. Curetty L.L. Harrich D.A. Radolf J.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3845-3852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and those of T. denticola (17Sela M.N. Bolotin A. Naor R. Weinberg A. Rosen G. J. Periodontal Res. 1997; 32: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) activate macrophages (18Rosen G. Sela M.N. Naor R. Halabi A. Barak V. Shapira L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1180-1186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we described the immunostimulating activity of the outer membrane extract (OME) from several treponemes (19Asai Y. Jinno T. Ogawa T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, glycolipids extracted from T. denticola, Treponema maltophilum, and Treponema brennaborense (20Schultz C.P. Wolf V. Lange R. Mertens E. Wecke J. Naumann D. Zähringer U. J. Biol.

Cell activation induced by these treponemal components also depends on CD14, as well as TLR2 or TLR4 (21Schröder N.W. Opitz B. Lamping N. Michelsen K.S. Zähringer U. Göbel U.B. Schumann R.R. J.

Although the immunostimulating activities of treponemal components are considerably weaker than those of LPS, the former have been suggested to induce inflammatory responses in infected lesions, which are followed by damage to host tissues. Such host responses may lead to the clearance of pathogens from the infected lesion and recovery from diseases. However, in chronic infection, persistent organisms remains in the infected tissues, thus, the organisms involved likely have mechanisms for evading host defenses. The structural features of the outer membrane of treponemes are considered to be involved with evasion from the immune system. For example, the outer membrane of T. pallidum is populated by a remarkably low concentration of transmembrane proteins (26Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. Schulz W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Norris S.J. Cox D.L. Weinstock G.M. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 37-62PubMed Google Scholar), which limits its antigenicity and may lead to inertness against the immune system. Treponemes are also known to be rich in lipids, as they comprise ∼20% of the dry cell weight (28Johnson R.C Livermore B.P. Jenkin H.M. Eggebraten L. Infect. Immun. 1970; 2: 606-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, the antibody against cardiolipin (CL), a major lipid of T. pallidum (29Belisle J.T. Brandt M.H. Radolf J.D. Norgard M.V. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), has been detected in the sera of patients with syphilis and used for diagnosis (30Harris E.N. Gharavi A.E. Wasley G.D. Hughes G.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1988; 157: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that lipid components are released from organisms and play some kind of role in the host. Herein, we describe an inhibitory role for a treponemal membrane phospholipid against PAMPs-induced innate immune response. Reagents—Phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol from egg yolk (EYPG), phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (EYPC), and bovine heart (BHPC), phosphatidylethanolamine from egg yolk (EYPE), cardiolipin from bovine heart (BHCL), phosphatidic acid from egg yolk (EYPA), phosphatidylinositol from bovine liver (BLPI), phosphatidylserine from bovine brain (BBPS), 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), 1,2-dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (DPPG), Escherichia coli O55:B5 LPS, and dsRNA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Staphylococcus aureus PGN was prepared as previously described (31Ogawa T. Kotani S. Fukuda K. Tsukamoto Y. Mori M. Kusumoto S. Shiba T. Infect. Immun. 1982; 38: 817-824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as was CpG DNA (5Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5426) Google Scholar). OME from Treponema medium (TmOME) was prepared as previously described (19Asai Y. Jinno T. Ogawa T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant human (rh) TNF-α was obtained from Dainippon Pharmaceutical (Osaka, Japan). RhCD14 and rhLBP were purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN) and soluble-type human CD14 (sCD14) was kindly provided from Dr. Y. Kuroki, Department of Biochemistry, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine (32Sano H. Chiba H. Iwaki D. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22442-22451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Anti-LBP polyclonal antibody was obtained from HyCult biotechnology (Uden, Netherlands) and anti-CD14 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Genzyme Techne (Minneapolis, MN). Preparation of Treponemal Lipids—T. medium ATCC 700293 and T. denticola ATCC 35405 were grown anaerobically in trypticase-yeast extract-gelatin-volatile fatty acids-rabbit serum broth as described previously (19Asai Y. Jinno T. Ogawa T. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 717-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Bacterial total lipids were extracted using the chloroformmethanol method of Bligh and Dyer (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43406) Google Scholar), and designated TmTL for T. medium and TdTL for T. denticola. To separate the lipid components, TmTL and TdTL were each subjected to silica gel column chromatography using solvent system A, followed by preparative silica gel TLC using solvent systems B and C, as follows: A, chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4); B, chloroform/methanol/ammonia solution (65:25:5); C, chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (5:2:1:1:0.5). Spots on the TLC were visualized using anisaldehyde sulfuric acid reagent. Analytical Procedures—Proton and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Unity Inova spectrometer (Varian) at 500 and 126 MHz, respectively, and obtained at 297 K. The chemical shifts are expressed in δ-values with chloroform (δ 7.25 and 77.0) as the internal standard for 1H and 13C spectra, respectively. MALDI-TOF-MS was measured using a QSTAR Pulsar i (Applied Biosystems) instrument equipped with an oMALDI ion source. Samples were combined with 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix and placed on a sample plate. Spectra were obtained in positive ion mode. Cells—Ba/F3 cells stably expressing murine TLR4/MD-2 and p55Igκ-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter construct (Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells), were kindly provided by Dr. K. Miyake, Division of Infectious Genetics, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, and maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, IL-3, and 50 μm of 2-mercaptoethanol (34Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A mouse macrophage cell line, J774 (Dainippon Pharmaceutical), and murine fibroblast cell line, Balb-3T3 (Health Science Research Bank, Osaka, Japan), were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml of gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml of amphotericin B. Eight-week-old female C3H/HeN mice and BALB/c mice were obtained from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The animals received humane care in accordance with our institutional guidelines and the legal requirements of Japan. Alveolar macrophages were obtained from mice using a modified technique of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as described previously, with a slight modification (35Salez L. Balloy V. van Rooijen N. Lebastard M. Touqui L. McCormack F.X. Chignard M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6376-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Elicited peritoneal macrophages were obtained from mice 3 days after intraperitoneal inoculation of 1.0 ml of 3% sterile Brewer's thioglycolate broth (BD Biosciences). BAL cells and peritoneal exudate cells were centrifuged and suspended in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μg/ml of gentamicin, and 50 ng/ml of amphotericin B at 1 × 106 cells/ml. These cells were then distributed to each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed plate (Falcon) at 2 × 105 cells/200 μl, after which they were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Each well was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline to remove non-adherent cells, and those attached to the culture plate served as alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Luciferase Assays—Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells were inoculated onto 96-well flat-bottomed plates at 1 × 105 cells in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 supplemented with or without 5% fetal bovine serum, and stimulated with the indicated doses of LPS together with or without the test specimens. In some experiments, Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells were stimulated with test specimens in the presence or absence of 500 ng/ml of CD14 and 50 ng/ml of LBP. After 4 h at 37 °C, 100 μl of Bright-Glo™ luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to each well, and luminescence was quantified with a luminometer (Promega). Results are shown as relative luciferase activity, which was the ratio of stimulated activity to non-stimulated activity, in each cell line. mRNA Expression—J774 cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml of LPS with or without 1 μg/ml of POPG in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for 4 h at 37 °C. Total RNA was extracted by a single-step extraction method with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed with extracted total RNA using an RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan), with sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers specific for TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, or β-actin (36Ehlers S. Mielke M.E. Blankenstein T. Hahn H. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3016-3022PubMed Google Scholar, 37Montgomery R.A. Dallman M.J. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 554-560PubMed Google Scholar). For a negative control, a non-RT sample was amplified by PCR reaction. PCR products were detected by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Western Blotting—J774 cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml of LPS in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml of POPG in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected and p38 mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA). Cytokine Assays—Cells were stimulated with the indicated doses of the test specimens together with or without 10 μg/ml of POPG in culture medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °C. After incubation, culture supernatants were collected and used for the cytokine assay. In some experiments, C3H/HeN mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg of LPS with or without 1 mg of POPG in 1 ml of saline. Serum specimens were then obtained 1.5–3 h after injection. The test specimens were analyzed using an ELISA kit for secreted TNF-α, IL-6 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), IL-1β (Endogen, Woburn, MA), and KC (Genzyme Techne), and results determined using a standard curve prepared for each assay. Activation of Limulus Clotting Factor C—LPS was incubated with or without the indicated dose of POPG for 30 min at 37 °C. LPS-induced activation of Limulus clotting factor C was measured using an Endospecy™ Test (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding of LPS to LBP and CD14 —Biotinylated LPS was prepared as previously described (38Luk J.M. Kumar A. Tsang R. Staunton D. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Binding of biotinylated LPS to rhLBP that was captured by anti-LBP adsorbed onto ELISA plates was measured as previously described, with a slight modification (39Scott M.G. Vreugdenhil A.C. Buurman W.A. Hancock R.E. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 549-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The binding was performed for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. Binding of biotinylated LPS to rhCD14 adsorbed onto the ELISA plates was detected as previously described (40Cunningham M.D. Seachord C. Ratcliffe K. Bainbridge B. Aruffo A. Darveau R.P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 3601-3608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50 ng/ml rhLBP. Binding of biotinylated LPS to sCD14 that was captured by anti-CD14 adsorbed onto ELISA plates was measured as follows. Anti-CD14 (50 μl, 10 μg/ml) was placed onto an ELISA plate, incubated at 4 °C for 12 h, and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 1 h. Biotinylated LPS (1 μg/ml) and sCD14 (5 μg/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 13 h with or without the indicated doses of the phospholipid. After washing the plate with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, the mixture was placed and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h to capture sCD14. Bound biotinylated LPS was detected using streptavidin-peroxidase and TMB substrate (KPL, Guildford, UK). Murine Abscess Model—Abscess formation assay was performed as described previously (41Kesavalu L. Walker S.G. Holt S.C. Crawley R.R. Ebersole J.L. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5096-5102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with living T. medium cells (109 cells) with or without 1 mg of POPG in 0.5 ml of saline on the posterior dorsolatal surface. After challenge, lesion size (length and width) was measured daily for 9 days with a caliper gauge, and the area was expressed in square millimeters. Treponemal Phospholipid Inhibits LPS-induced Immune Responses—T. medium is a medium-sized oral spirochete found in the subgingival plaque of patients with adult periodontitis (42Umemoto T. Nakazawa F. Hoshino E. Okada K. Fukunaga M. Namikawa I. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be associated with chronic periodontal diseases (43Paster B.J. Boches S.K. Galvin J.L. Ericson R.E.

Microbiol. 2002; 40: 3334-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We investigated the immunobiological activity of its lipid components. Total membrane lipids (TmTL) were extracted from T. medium using the Bligh-Dyer method (33Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Biophysiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43406) Google Scholar), which yielded ca. 25% from dried cells. TmTL possessed no immunostimulating activity with mammalian immune cells, whereas they were found to have an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced innate immune responses. This inhibitory effect was examined using Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells (34Akashi S. Shimazu R. Ogata H. Nagai Y. Takeda K. Kimoto M. Miyake K. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3471-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), in which TmTL inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 1a). Since TmTL was shown to contain several components (Fig. 2), the lipids were subjected to column chromatography to yield five fractions, Fr. a–e. Among them, Fr. d, which was comprised of ∼15% TmTL, was found to possess a strong dose-dependent inhibitory effect with an IC50 of 0.12 μg/ml at an LPS concentration of 10 ng/ml (Fig. 1, a and b). Since Fr. d did not decrease TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells (Fig. 1c), cell viability was not responsible for the effect. Fr. e showed a weak inhibitory effect (IC50 = ∼100 μg/ml), while the others had none (Fig. 1a).Fig. 2Two-dimensional TLC profile of TmTL. The TLC profile was developed using a chloroform/methanol/ammonia solution (65:25:5) for the first dimension followed by chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (5:2:1:1:0.5) for the second dimension. The spots were visualized using anisaldehyde-sulfuric acid reagent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PG Is Responsible for Inhibitory Effect—Earlier studies of treponemal membrane lipid (45Matthews H.M.

In the positive ion mode MALDI-TOF mass spectra of Fr. d, ions at m/z 687.5, 701.5, 715.5, and 755.5 were mainly observed. These ions represented a PG type structure; however, it substituted a vinyl ether group for an acyl group: e.g. m/z 701.5 was a sodium ion adduct of PG consisting of 15:0 fatty acid and 14:0 vinyl ether, and m/z 755.5 was that of 18:1 fatty acid and 14:0 vinyl ether. The fragmentation patterns of the precursor ions at m/z 701.5 proved the structure (Fig. 3a). The position of the vinyl ether substitution was determined to be the 1-position of glycerol by NMR spectra (Fig. 3b). Thus, Fr. d was designated as TmPG. A similar PG fraction (TdPG, ∼2.6% from dried cells) was obtained from a closely related bacterium, T. denticola, and it also inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells (Fig. 1a). Structural Requirement of Phospholipid for Inhibitory Effect—To investigate the structure-activity relationship, we examined the inhibitory effects of various phospholipids on LPS-induced NF-κB activation in Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells (Fig. 4a). EYPG, a PG that contains diacylglycerol instead of 1-vinyl-2-acylglycerol in TmPG, showed an inhibitory effect. The effect of EYPG was dose-dependent and the IC50 was 0.47 μg/ml (Fig. 4b), which was comparable to that of TmPG. EYPC and EYPE, which are also the diacyl type but have a different head group, each had no inhibitory effect at the highest concentration tested (100 μg/ml). BHPC, which includes 1-vinyl-2-acylglycerol similar to TmPG, showed a weak inhibitory effect (IC50 = ∼50 μg/ml). In the negatively charged phospholipids, EYPA possessed no inhibitory effect. In contrast, BHCL, BLPI, and BBPS showed inhibitory effects (IC50 = 0.03, 0.25, 0.35 μg/ml, respectively) similar to PG. To determine the effect of fatty acids moiety, the inhibitory effects of synthetic specimens were also examined (Fig. 4, a and c). POPG and DOPG, which contain unsaturated fatty acids, inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activation (IC50 = 0.31, 0.36 μg/ml, respectively), whereas DPPG, which includes only saturated fatty acids, showed no effect. PG Inhibits PAMPs-induced Cell Stimulation—To elucidate the details of the effect of PG on the innate immune system, we performed experiments with POPG as a synthetic model compound of PG. POPG inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 production by J774 cells (Fig. 5a), and was also effective with peritoneal macrophages, alveolar macrophages, and Balb-3T3 cells (Fig. 5, b–d). POPG also diminished the LPS-induced mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in J774 (Fig. 6a). Since cytokine production and mRNA expression are associated with the activation of NF-κB, the results with J774 cells and Ba/mTLR4/mMD-2 cells coincided. POPG blocked the LPS-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in J774 cells (Fig. 6b), which is upstream of the signaling cascade of NF-κB activation. The NF-κB cascade is activated by various PAMPs through TLRs. To determine the upstream of the signaling cascades, ligand specificity was investigated in regards to the inhibitory effect of cytokine production by J774 cells (Figs. 5 and 6c). IL-6 production mediated by PGN as well as by LPS was inhibited by POPG, and the production of TmOME, a mixture of treponemal surface components, was also inhibited, whereas IL-6 production by dsRNA and CpG DNA was not.

Administration of a specific synthetic liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, T0901317, in mice resulted in an increase of not only HDL cholesterol but also HDL particle size (Cao, G., Beyer, T. P., Yang, X. P., Schmidt, R. J., Zhang, Y., Bensch, W. R., Kauffman, R. F., Gao, H., Ryan, T. P., Liang, Y., Eacho, P. I., and Jiang, X. C. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 39561–39565). We have investigated the roles that apoE and CETP may play in this process. We treated apoE-deficient, cholesterol ester transport protein (CETP) transgenic, and wild type mice with various doses of the LXR agonist and monitored their HDL levels. Fast protein liquid chromatography and apolipoprotein analysis revealed that in apoE knockout mouse plasma, there was neither induction of larger HDL formation nor increase of HDL cholesterol, suggesting that apoE is essential for the LXR agonist effects on HDL metabolism. In CETP transgenic mice, CETP expression completely abolished LXR agonist-mediated HDL enlargement and greatly attenuated HDL cholesterol levels. Analysis of HDL particles by electron microscope and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis revealed similar findings. In apoE-deficient mice, LXR agonist also produced a significant increase in very low density lipoprotein/low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B content.

Mikhailidis D.P. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2002; 18: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The biogenesis of HDL is thought to originate from the secretion of its major apolipoprotein component, apoAI, from the liver and the small intestine. ApoAI enters the circulation and interacts with and removes excessive free cholesterol from peripheral tissues, forming disc-like nascent HDL particles. ApoAI-dependent phospholipid and cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues requires the protein ABCA1, an ATP binding cassette transporter (2.Attie A.D. Kastelein J.P. Hayden M.R. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1717-1726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The maturation of HDL depends on both lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) activities. The former esterifies free cholesterol to form spherical HDL (3.Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the latter transfers phospholipid from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins into the nascent HDL particles (4.Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes transfer of cholesteryl ester from mature HDL into apoB-containing lipoproteins for catabolism through liver low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) (5.Tall A.R. Jiang X. Luo Y. Silver D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HDL cholesterol can also be delivered to the liver via scavenger receptor BI, the HDL receptor, through the process of selective cholesterol uptake (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the regulation of ABCA1, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, PLTP, CETP, and scavenger receptor BI would have an important impact on HDL metabolism, including particle catabolic rate, lipid composition, and particle size. high density lipoprotein ATP binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol ester transport protein CETP transgenic apolipoprotein E apolipoprotein AI liver X receptor phospholipid transfer protein low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein receptor fast protein liquid chromatography. high density lipoprotein ATP binding cassette transporter A1 cholesterol ester transport protein CETP transgenic apolipoprotein E apolipoprotein AI liver X receptor phospholipid transfer protein low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein receptor fast protein liquid chromatography.

Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11934-11943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CETP may be another factor that can influence the formation of large HDL particles. In patients with complete CETP deficiency, HDL is increased in size and enriched in apoE and cholesteryl esters (30.Yamashita S. Sprecher D.L. Sakai N. Matsuzawa Y. Tarui S. Hui D.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 688-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Conversely, in CETP transgenic rats, conversion of large HDL to small HDL particles was observed (31.Zak Z. Lagrost L.

In order to investigate the contribution of apoE and CETP in the LXR-mediated formation of enlarged HDL particles, we treated CETP transgenic (CETP-Tg), apoE-deficient (apoE–/–), and wild type mice with various doses of LXR agonist, T0901317. We show that in these mice, the enlargement of HDL particle size after administrating the LXR agonist requires apoE and is completely abolished by CETP expression. Animals—Seven-week-old male mice were purchased and acclimated for 1 week prior to the start of the study. C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Human CETP-Tg and apoE-deficient (apoE–/–) mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Mice were provided Purina 5001 food ad libitum, and the compound was dosed once daily via oral gavage for 7 days. Animals were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation in the morning, 2 h after the eighth dose; blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture; and tissues were collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Lipoprotein Analysis by FPLC—Lipoprotein analysis was performed as described (13.Cao G. Beyer T.P. Yang X.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Liang Y. Eacho P.I. Jiang X.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39561-39565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma samples from animals were prepared and pooled. 50 μl of pooled sample was applied to Superose 6 size exclusion columns and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cholesterol content of different fractions was measured by commercial kit. Lipoprotein Analysis by Nondenaturing Gel Electrophoresis—Five microliters of mouse plasma was loaded on a 4–20% nondenaturing gel (Bio-Rad), which was prerun with TBE buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 4 °C, 50 V, for 1 h. The electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C and 50 V for 12 h. The gel then was stained with 1% of Oil Red O (in isopropyl alcohol) at 58 °C for 6 h. Analysis of Isolated HDL Particles by Native Gel Electrophoresis— Lipoproteins were purified by sequential ultracentrifugation using a TL 100.4 rotor with a tabletop TL 100 centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). HDL was purified between the densities of 1.063 and 1.210 g/ml in all animals. HDL particles were separated by gradient gel electrophoresis (4–20%; Bio-Rad) under nonreducing and nondenaturing conditions. The electrophoresis was carried out for 3 h, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with a solution of methanol/acetic acid/water (30:58:12, v/v/v). Western Blot Analysis—Plasma samples were separated by FPLC size exclusion columns and different fractions were pooled (fractions 20–23, 24–27, 28–31, 32–36, and 37–41) for apolipoprotein analysis. Designated FPLC fraction samples were separated on Tris/glycine gels (Novex) under denaturing conditions. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and then blotted with antibodies to apolipoprotein AI or E (Biodesign) or apolipoprotein B48/100 (U. S. Biological). Blots were developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and documented using X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Isolated HDL fractions were analyzed on a gradient gel (4–20%; Bio-Rad) under reducing and denaturing conditions, followed by a similar procedure as described above. SDS-PAGE Apolipoprotein Analysis—Plasma HDL (density = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) and LDL (density = 1.006–1.063 g/ml) were separated by preparative ultracentrifugation. SDS-PAGE was performed on 3–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and the aplipoproteins were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described (4.Jiang X.C. Bruce C. Mar J. Lin M. Ji Y. Francone O.L. Tall A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Negative stain electron microscopy was done using a JEM-100C electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Cranford, NJ). Lipoprotein samples in 125 mm ammonium acetate, 2.6 mm ammonium carbonate, and 0.26 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) were mixed with an equal volume of 2% sodium phosphotungstate (pH 7.4) on a carbon/Formvar-coated copper grid (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). After 30 s, the excess liquid was blotted, the rest was allowed to dry, and the grid was examined within 1 h. mRNA Analysis—Total RNAs were prepared from frozen tissue samples with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Mouse ABCA1 and PLTP mRNA were measured by an RNase protection assay. A primer set was used to amplify a fragment of about 200 base pairs from mouse macrophage RAW cells for ABCA1 probe. The resulting 200-bp fragment was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced. The resulting construct was linearized, and RNA probe was synthesized using the Promega T7/SP6 transcription kit. Specific activity was >108 dpm/μg. After column purification, the probe was used for RPA analysis by using a kit from Ambion. The probe for PLTP mRNA measurement was described previously (13.Cao G. Beyer T.P. Yang X.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Liang Y. Eacho P.I. Jiang X.C. J. Biol.

Previously, it was observed that treatment of C57BL/6 mice with a specific LXR agonist, T0901317, resulted in an increase of both HDL cholesterol and particle size (13.Cao G. Beyer T.P. Yang X.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Liang Y. Eacho P.I. Jiang X.C. J. Biol.

To investigate the effect of apoE on the formation of enlarged HDL particles, as well as on HDL cholesterol levels, we treated apoE–/– mice with T0901317 at 10 and 50 mg/kg for 7 days. Wild type C57BL/6 mice were treated in a similar scheme for comparison. As reported previously (13.Cao G. Beyer T.P. Yang X.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P.

The HDL fraction included a primary peak (fractions 32–41) as well as a second peak (fractions 28–31), which was largely absent in vehicle-treated C57BL/6 mice. This latter peak overlapped with that of the LDL fraction, based on its size and the presence of apolipoproteins B-48 and B-100 (Fig. 2A). The apoE content of these FPLC elutes was markedly increased by treatment of 50 mg/kg T0901317 (the overall plasma apoE content was increased about 80% as judged by the quantitative Western blots), whereas the apoB level was not significantly changed (Fig. 2A), which confirmed our previous findings (13.Cao G. Beyer T.P. Yang X.P. Schmidt R.J. Zhang Y. Bensch W.R. Kauffman R.F. Gao H. Ryan T.P. Liang Y. Eacho P.I. Jiang X.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39561-39565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The apoAI content of both HDL peaks was increased by T0901317.Fig. 2Apolipoprotein analysis of FPLC fractions by Western blots. The fractions eluted from FPLC size exclusion columns were pooled (18–22, 23–28, 29–33, 34–39, and 40–44), and 10-μl samples were applied to Tris/glycine gels under denaturing conditions. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and then blotted with antibodies to apolipoprotein AI or E (Biodesign) or apolipoprotein B48/100 (U. S. Biological). Blots were developed with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and documented using X-Omat film (Kodak). Samples were from wild type (A), apoE–/– (B), and CETP transgenic mice (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In apoE–/– mice, VLDL/LDL represent major lipoprotein components and HDL represents a minor fraction of the FPLC profile. There was no apparent increase in HDL size or HDL cholesterol after the LXR agonist treatment (Fig. 1B). To further analyze the data, we expanded the FPLC plot that covered fractions 30–42 (Fig. 1B′). No HDL cholesterol increase was observed (fractions 36–42), and some elevation of cholesterol upon LXR agonist treatment (fractions 30–35) was closely associated with a large amount of apoB48 representing remnant lipoprotein particles. In VLDL/LDL fractions 24–27 and 28–31 of the apoE–/– mice, there was a dose-related increase in the cholesterol content (Fig. 1B) and an increase of apoB48 (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, apoAI was present in these fractions, as was observed previously in apoE–/– mice (32.Plump A.S. Breslow J.L. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 495-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and was slightly increased by treatment with T0901317 (Fig. 2B). ApoAI level was not changed in fractions 32–36 and appeared to be slightly decreased in fractions 37–41 in response to LXR agonist treatment. Thus, administration of the LXR agonist to apoE–/– mice did not appear to cause HDL particle enlargement or an increase in HDL cholesterol levels. Instead, cholesterol in remnant particles was increased. To investigate the role of CETP in the LXR agonist-mediated changes in HDL cholesterol metabolism, we utilized a transgenic model in which the human CETP transgene was expressed under the control of the human apoAI promoter (33.Grass D.S. Saini U. Felkner R.H. Wallace R.E. Lago W.J. Young S.G. Swanson M.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1082-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LXRs are not known to regulate apoAI (15.Schultz J.R. Tu H. Luk A. Repa J.J. Medina J.C. Li L. Schwendner S. Wang S. Thoolen M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Lustig K.D. Shan B. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2831-2838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), and we found that treatment of these mice with T0901317 did not result in a change in plasma CETP activity (data not shown). Treatment of these mice with T0901317 did not lead to the formation of enlarged HDL particles (Fig. 1C), as was observed in C57BL/6 mice. A small increase in HDL cholesterol was only observed at the higher dose of the compound used. No significant increase of apoAI or apoE in the HDL fraction was observed (Fig. 2C). Thus, CETP expression greatly attenuated the LXR agonist-induced HDL cholesterol increase and abolished the increase in HDL particle size. To further confirm the HDL cholesterol and particle size changes in these different animal models after oral administration of the LXR agonist, we utilized nondenaturing gel electrophoresis to evaluate HDL particles. Mouse plasma samples were applied to the nondenaturing gels (4–20% gradient), which were then stained with Oil Red O after running. HDL particles were readily separated and stained on the gel, whereas VLDL/LDL particles could not get into the gel because of the size. In C57BL/6 mice, T0901317 treatment increased the intensity of Oil Red O staining of HDL in a dose-dependent manner, reflecting an increase in HDL lipid (Fig. 3A). A dose-dependent HDL particle size enlargement was also evident (Fig. 3A). In apoE–/– mice, there was reduced HDL lipid content but no change in particle size after LXR agonist treatment (Fig. 3B). In CETP transgenic mice, LXR agonist administration did not change HDL particle size, and the increase of HDL lipid contents was attenuated (Fig. 3C). Thus, the analysis of HDL cholesterol and particle size with nondenaturing gels confirmed the findings of our FPLC analysis. In order to unequivocally prove the results described above, we physically separated HDL particles from LDL particles by ultracentrifugation. The isolated HDL fractions were subjected to electron microscopic study (Fig. 4A). The HDL particle size from wild type animals was in the range of 10–12 nm in diameter. T0901317 treatment resulted in an obvious enlargement of HDL particles. The size of largest HDL particle reached about 20 nm in diameter. On the contrary, T0901317 treatment in either apoE-deficient mice or CETP transgenic mice did not induce any significant change in HDL particle size (Fig. 4A). The isolated HDL fractions were then analyzed by native gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4B). Consistent with electron microscopic data, T0901317 treatment of wild type mice resulted in slower migration of HDL particles in the native gel under nondenaturing conditions, suggesting the increase in HDL particle size. Treatment of apoE-deficient mice or CETP transgenic mice, however, did not result in any observable changes in the mobility of HDL particles. The presence of apoAI and apoE in these HDL particles isolated from ultracentrifugation was further proved with Western blot analysis (Fig. 4C). Increases in both apoAI and apoE content in these HDL particles after T0901317 treatment of wild type mice was evident, whereas no change was observed in either apoE-deficient mice or CETP transgenic mice. We further performed SDS-PAGE apolipoprotein analysis on isolated LDL and HDL from wild type mouse plasma with or without LXR agonist treatment. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the isolated LDL contained significant amounts of apoB48 and apoB100. The isolated HDL particles had no detectable apoB, whereas the LXR agonist treatment greatly increased apoE and apoAI levels. Since HDL particles from LXR agonist-treated animal plasma contained normal HDL and enlarged HDL, the results indicated that the later did not contain any appreciable amount of apoB.Fig. 5SDS-PAGE analysis of apolipoproteins from ultracentrifugally isolated mouse plasma with or without LXR agonist treatment. Plasma HDL (density = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) and LDL (density = 1.006–1.063 g/ml) were separated by preparative ultracentrifugation as described. SDS-PAGE was performed on 3–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel, and the apolipoproteins were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the molecular mechanisms of the above-mentioned observations, we analyzed mRNA regulation of two important LXR target genes, ABCA1 and PLTP, in the liver. Treatment of C57BL/6 mice at 50 mg/kg resulted in a 2.7-fold induction of ABCA1 and a 5.3-fold increase of PLTP. In apoE–/– mice, both ABCA1 and PLTP up-regulation was readily detectable (2.4- and 3.7-fold, respectively). In CETP transgenic mice, ABCA1 and PLTP were also up-regulated by LXR agonist (2.3- and 2.5-fold, respectively) (Fig"

A detailed understanding of the hydrolysis of RNA by this and related enzymes will require the integration of structural and molecular data with quantitative measurements of RNA hydrolysis. Therefore, an assay for RNaseE that can be set up to have relatively high throughput while being sensitive and quantitative will be advantageous. Here we describe such an assay, which is based on the automated high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of fluorescently labeled RNA samples. We have used this assay to optimize reaction conditions, to determine for the first time the catalytic parameters for a polypeptide of RNaseE, and to investigate the RNaseE-catalyzed reaction through the modification of functional groups within an RNA substrate. We find that catalysis is dependent on both protonated and unprotonated functional groups and that the recognition of a guanosine sequence determinant that is upstream of the scissile bond appears to consist of interactions with the exocyclic 2-amino group, the 7N of the nucleobase and the imino proton or 6-keto group. Additionally, we find that a ribose-like sugar conformation is preferred in the 5′-nucleotide of the scissile phosphodiester bond and that a 2′-hydroxyl group proton is not essential. Steric bulk at the 2′ position in the 5′-nucleotide appears to be inhibitory to the reaction.

The 3′-exonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase, the RhlB helicase, and the glycolytic enzyme enolase are the other major components of this macromolecular complex (22Carpousis A.J. Van Houwe G.

A. 1996; 93: 3865-3869Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In general, it appears that endonucleolytic hydrolysis by RNaseE initiates the decay of transcripts in E. coli (for reviews, see Refs. 4Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 5Grunberg-Manago M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 193-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 6Regnier P. Arraiano C.M. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown in vitro that RNaseE preferentially cleaves RNAs that have a 5′-monophosphate group (24Mackie G.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 720-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). As primary transcripts in E. coli have a triphosphate group at their 5′ end and the RNaseE-catalyzed hydrolysis generates downstream intermediates that have a 5′-monophosphate group (9Ghora B.K. Apirion D. Cell. 1978; 15: 1055-1066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), the ability of RNaseE to assess the phosphorylation status of 5′ ends may ensure that after this enzyme has made the first cut in a primary transcript, it will tend to cut any sites downstream before starting on another intact transcript. The N-terminal half of RNaseE is sufficient to discriminate substrates that have a monophosphate group at the 5′ end (25Tock M.R. Walsh A.P. Carroll G. McDowall K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8726-8732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Jiang X. Diwa A. Belasco J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2468-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). There is evidence for “5′ end dependence” in vivo and it has been suggested that this facet of RNaseE-catalyzed cleavage may contribute to the finding that RNA decay occurs in general without the production of significant levels of intermediates in E. coli (27Mackie G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25069-25072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Polypeptides that have sequences similar to E. coli RNaseE have been predicted from approximately half of the eubacterial genomes that have been sequenced and in the plastids of plants (for review, see Ref. 28Condon C. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5339-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In all of the cases that we know of, the sequence similarity covers at least part of the N-terminal half of E. coli RNaseE. Only some members of the RNaseE family are elaborated with N- and C-terminal extensions, and these vary greatly in length and have little sequence conservation (28Condon C. Putzer H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5339-5346Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In the case of E. coli, it is known that the C-terminal domain is required for the normal rapid decay of mRNA in vivo (12Lopez P.J. Marchand I. Joyce S.A. Dreyfus M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 188-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 13Ow M.C. Liu Q. Kushner S.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 854-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Leroy A. Vanzo N.F. Sousa S. Dreyfus M. Carpousis A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and it has been suggested that extensions serve to adapt the activity of the catalytic domains of RNaseE-related enzymes to mediate patterns of RNA processing and decay that are appropriate for the corresponding bacteria or plastid (14Leroy A. Vanzo N.F. Sousa S. Dreyfus M. Carpousis A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1231-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide substrates synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry are being used increasingly to study hydrolysis of RNA by RNaseE in vitro. In the first study of this enzyme that used oligonucleotide substrates, it was found that a decaribonucleotide (ACAGU↓AUUUG) corresponding in sequence to the single-stranded region at the 5′ end of RNAI, the antisense regulator of ColE1-type plasmid replication, is cut at least as efficiently as the corresponding full-length transcript by RNaseE (29McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It was subsequently found for the 9 S precursor of 5 S rRNA that the “a” site (ACAGA↓AUUUG) but not the “b” site (AUCAA↓AUAAA) is cut efficiently (17Kaberdin V.R. Walsh A.P. Jakobsen T. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The b site, in contrast to the other two, lacks a G nucleotide upstream within 1–2 nucleotides of the phosphodiester bond, which within the context of 9 S RNA is hydrolyzed. Moreover, the swapping of a G for the A at position 4 in the b site oligonucleotide was sufficient to confer efficient hydrolysis, whereas the swapping of a U for the G at position 4 in the a site blocked hydrolysis of the oligonucleotide substrate (17Kaberdin V.R. Walsh A.P. Jakobsen T. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The alignment of known RNaseE sites (e.g. Ref. 30Ehretsmann C.P. Carpousis A.J. Krisch H.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) has revealed that many have a G nucleotide that is 5′ and is in close proximity to the susceptible bond. In light of the swapping experiments described above, this suggests that such positioned G nucleotides are of general importance as determinants of RNA hydrolysis in E. coli. The mechanism by which the b site within the context of a 9 S transcript is cleaved by RNaseE despite the absence of an upstream G remains to be determined. It is possible that the recruitment of RNaseE is regulated by some secondary structural element(s) (17Kaberdin V.R. Walsh A.P. Jakobsen T. McDowall K.J. von Gabain A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as suggested relatively early in the study of RNaseE (1Ehretsmann C.P. Carpousis A.J. Krisch H.M. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3186-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Ehretsmann C.P. Carpousis A.J. Krisch H.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) or the distance between susceptible sequences and a monophosphate at the 5′ end (25Tock M.R. Walsh A.P. Carroll G. McDowall K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8726-8732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). From the above, it can be seen that an understanding of the recognition and hydrolysis of RNA by RNaseE will require a systematic analysis of the contribution of RNA sequence and structure, including the phosphorylation status at the 5′ end, the multiple domains within the C-terminal half of RNaseE, and the effects of other degradosome component. With this in mind, we have developed an assay system described here that can have relatively high throughput while being sensitive and quantitative. We also describe the optimization of reaction conditions for the N-terminal catalytic half of RNaseE and the determination of Michaelis-Menten parameters for this enzyme. In addition, we have identified functional groups in the G determinant that are required for efficient hydrolysis and the importance of substrates being ribose. This work establishes a foundation for investigating the recognition and hydrolysis of RNA by the RNaseE family of enzymes. Synthesis of Oligonucleotide Substrates—The oligoribonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table I. They were synthesized using ABI reagents on an ABI 391 DNA synthesizer with a standard 1-μmol DNA assembly cycle with the exception that the coupling time was extended to 15 min with a 1-s acetonitrile delivery at 7.5 min. The standard phosphoramidites were purchased from ChemGenes, Inc. The exocyclic amino groups of adenine and cytosine were benzoylprotected, whereas guanine was isobutyryl-protected. Inosine-TOM-CE (5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-triisopropylsilyloxymethyl inosine-3′-O-phosphoramidite), 2-aminopurine TOM CE (N-acetyl-5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-2′-O-triisopropylsilyloxymethyl-2-aminopurine-β-d-riboside-3′-O-phosphoramidite), and 2′-deoxy-5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-2′-fluorouridine-3′-O-phosphoramidite were purchased from Glen Research. 7-Deaza-5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-2′-tert-butyldimethylsilylguanosine-3′-O-phosphoramidite and 2′-amino-2′-deoxy-5′-O-dimethoxytrityl-2′-tert-butyldimethylsilyluridine-3′-O-phosphoramidite were purchased from ChemGenes, Inc. Unless specified otherwise, the oligoribonucleotides were phosphorylated at the 5′ end using 2-[2-(4,4′-dimethoxytrityloxy)ethylsulfonyl]ethyl-(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite (Chemical Phosphorylation Reagent) supplied by Glen Research. The oligonucleotides were deprotected with methanolic ammonia (30 °C, 30 h) followed by triethylamine trihydrogen fluoride/Me2SO treatment (1:1, 20 °C, 16 h). Deprotected oligonucleotides were added to a DNAPac PA-100 (4 × 250 mm) anion-exchange column (Dionex) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl, 20% (v/v) acetonitrile and were eluted with a gradient of 10–70% 1 m NaCl containing 20% (v/v) acetonitrile over 20 min. The peak fractions were further purified using a Jupiter C18 reverse-phase (5 μm, 300 Å, 4 × 250 mm) column (Phenomenex) equilibrated with 100 mm NH4OAc and eluted with a gradient of 0–35% 100 mm NH4OAc/acetonitrile (1:1) using a DX500 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Dionex). Q-Tof (quadrupole time-of-flight) mass spectrometry analysis in conjunction with maximum entropy analysis of the m/z spectrum revealed that the molecular mass of each of the oligoribonucleotides was within 0.7 Da of those calculated.Table IThe effects of nucleotide modifications on hydrolysis by RNaseESubstrate (modification)Reaction rate constantkcat/KM, m-1s-1BR101.50 × 107BR133.49 × 107BR10 G4(A)1.25 × 106BR10 G4(inosine)3.18 × 106BR10 G4(2-amino purine)1.46 × 106BR10 G4(7-deaza G)2.51 × 106BR10 U5(dU)ND*BR10 U5(2′-OMe U)ND**BR10 U5(2′-NH2 U)2.97 × 105BR10 U5(2′-F U)5.71 × 106 Open table in a new tab Production and Purification of the N-terminal Half of RNaseE—This was done using the pET expression and purification system (31Studier F.W.

A DNA fragment encoding the first 529 amino acid residues of RNaseE with a decahistidine tag at the C terminus was generated using a pair of primers with the following sequences: 5′-CATGCCATGGAAAGAATGTTAATCAACG-3′ (start codon is in italics, and NcoI site is underlined) and 5′-CGGGATCC TTAATGATGATGATGATG-ATGATGATGATGATGCAGCGCAGGTTGTTCCG-3′ (anti-stop codon is in boldface, and BamHI site is underlined). The PCR product was cut with NcoI and BamHI and inserted between the corresponding sites in the expression vector pET16b (Novagen). The resulting construct, called pRne529c, was then sequenced from both strands. BL21(DE3) cells containing this plasmid were grown at 37 °C in 750 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. When the optical density of the culture at 600 nm was 0.5–0.6, cells were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm and harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) after an additional 2 h of incubation. The cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, and 400 μl of a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). The cells were lysed by mechanical disruption with a French pressure cell press (SLM Instruments, Inc.) at 25,000 p.s.i., and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C) following by filtration through a 0.45-μm Filtopur S™ filter (Sarstedt). The soluble extract was applied to a 5-ml nickel-chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) that had been charged with Ni2+ and equilibrated with lysis buffer as per the vendor's instructions. The column was washed with five volumes of lysis buffer, and then the tagged protein was eluted with an 80-ml gradient of imidazole (0–1000 mm) in lysis buffer. The elution of protein peaked at 400 mm imidazole. The protein in the peak was concentrated using MacroSep ultrafiltration device with a 10-kDa cut-off membrane as described by the vendor (Flowgen). The concentrate was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (1.6 × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, and 0.5 m NaCl and protein eluted with the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the first of two peaks that eluted after the void volume were pooled, and the protein was concentrated as described above. The protein in the first peak corresponds to a multimeric predominantly tetrameric form of RNaseE. 2Callaghan, A. J., Grossmann, J. G., Redko, Y., Ilag, L. L., Moncrieffe, M. C., Symmons, M. F., Robinson, C. V., McDowall, K. J., and Luisi, B. F. (2003) Biochemistry, in press. The final protein concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance of samples at 280 nm. The extinction coefficient used for NTH-RNaseE tagged at the C terminus was 26,920 m–1 cm–1 as calculated using the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server tool (ca.expasy.org/). The purity of the preparation was greater than 95% as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis. 2Callaghan, A. J., Grossmann, J. G., Redko, Y., Ilag, L. L., Moncrieffe, M. C., Symmons, M. F., Robinson, C. V., McDowall, K. J., and Luisi, B. F. (2003) Biochemistry, in press. The Dependence of the Hydrolysis of RNA by RNaseE on pH—The effects of pH on RNaseE hydrolysis was studied using a substrate concentration of 6 μm and an enzyme concentration of 1 nm. Under these conditions, the initial reaction rate approaches its maximum. The reactions contained 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm of a buffering agent. The following pH values were analyzed: 5.5, 6.0, 6.5 (MES-HCl), 7.0, 7.3, 7.6, 8.0 (Tris-HCl), 8.5, 9.0, 9.5 (Bis-Tris-propane-HCl), 10.0, and 10.5 (CAPS-HCl). The reactions were initiated by the addition of an enzyme that had been diluted in the reaction buffer. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C, and aliquots were taken at appropriate time points. Samples were quenched by mixing aliquots with an equal volume of 20 mm EDTA and analyzed by ion-pair reverse phase chromatography using a Dionex high pressure liquid chromatography system with an in-line fluorescence detector (Model RF-2000) and automated sample injector (Model ASI-100). Chromatograms were analyzed with the use of Chromeleon SP1 software, version 6.4. A Transgenomic DNA Sep® cartridge was equilibrated with 70:30 mixture of 2.5 mm tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% (v/v) acetonitrile (buffer A) and 2.5 mm tetrabutyl ammonium bromide, 1 mm EDTA, and 70% (v/v) acetonitrile (buffer B). RNA oligonucleotides were eluted with a gradient of 30–60% buffer B over 10 min. The system was calibrated using a 5-mer, p-BR5-Fl, which corresponded to the 3′ product of RNaseE hydrolysis but was synthesized chemically. Initial rates of reaction at the various substrate concentrations were determined by plotting the amount of product against time. Data from triplicate experiments were averaged and fitted to a double ionization equation (35Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: a Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman, New York1999Google Scholar) using KaleidaGraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) as shown in Equation 1, kobs=[H+]KE1k0KE1KE2+[H+]KE1+[H+]2(Eq. 1) where K E1 and K E2 are acid dissociation constants of the free enzyme, k obs is the rate constant at a given pH, and k 0 is the maximal rate constant of the catalytically competent form of the enzyme. The Optimization of Magnesium and Salt Concentrations—To establish the optimum level of MgCl2, the concentration was varied from 0 to 150 mm. The reaction buffer for this experiment also contained 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane-HCl, pH 8.3, and 100 mm NaCl. The level of salt was optimized next using concentrations from 0 to 500 mm. This was done using reaction buffer that contained 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane-HCl, pH 8.3, and 15 mm MgCl2. Determination of Michaelis-Menten Parameters—RNaseE substrate p-BR10-Fl was incubated with 1 nm of the N-terminal half of RNaseE in 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane-HCl, pH 8.3, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The substrate concentrations varied from 100 nm to 6 μm. Kinetic parameters were calculated by non-linear regression fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation as shown in Equation 2, 3All of the curve fitting was carried out using KaleidaGraph software, version 3.52 (Synergy Software).υ[E]=kcat[S]KM+[S](Eq. 2) where v is the initial rate, [S] is the substrate concentration, and [E] is the total enzyme concentration. Assay of RNaseE under Pseudo-first Order Conditions—The reaction conditions and assay procedures were as described above. The final substrate and enzyme concentrations were 10 and 100 nm, respectively. The experiments were done at least three times, and average data were plotted and fitted to the pseudo-first order equation as shown in Equation 3, P=S01-expkcatKM[E]t(Eq. 3) where P is percentage of the product, S 0 is the initial percentage of substrate (100%), and [E] is the total enzyme concentration. The Assay of RNaseE by High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Fluorescein-labeled RNA—As an alternative to incorporating 32P at the 5′ end of oligoribonucleotides postsynthesis, we added fluorescein (Fl) to their 3′ end during chemical synthesis (for details of the RNAs used in this study, see Fig. 1). When required, a monophosphate (p) was added chemically to the 5′ end during synthesis to avoid the significant variation in efficiency that can occur when T4 polynucleotide kinase is used. In contrast to 32P-labeled substrates, we find that those with fluorescein can be kept for many months without detectable loss of label. Using a fluorescence imaging system, we have been able to detect bands in polyacrylamide gels that correspond to <10 femtomoles of fluorescein-labeled RNA. 4J. A. Stead and K. J. McDowall, unpublished data. This is comparable to the sensitivity of detecting 32P-labeled RNA by phosphorimaging (36Walsh A.P. Tock M.R. Mallen M.H. Kaberdin V.R. von Gabain A. McDowall K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1864-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have now automated the resolution and detection of RNA in reaction mixtures using ion-pair reverse phase chromatography coupled with an in-line fluorescence detector (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 2, panel A, a 5-nucleotide 3′-(Fl)-labeled fragment produced by hydrolysis of p-BR10-Fl, a 10-nucleotide substrate corresponding in sequence to the RNaseE site at the 5′ end of RNAI from pBR322 (29McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), can be separated readily. Moreover, this system can separate oligonucleotide substrates that differ only in the presence or absence of a monophosphate at the 5′ end (data not shown). Quantitation was calibrated using p-BR5-Fl, a synthetic mimic of the 5-nucleotide hydrolysis product. The fluorescence response was linear over our working range of 40 fmol–10 pmol (Fig. 2, panel B). Furthermore, the amount of fluorescence from p-BR5-Fl was the same as that from equal amounts of p-BR10-Fl or a derivative p-BR13-Fl, which has three extra Gs at the very 5′ end (data not shown). Optimization of Conditions for RNaseE Hydrolysis of Oligonucleotide Substrates—The reaction conditions for the NTH of RNaseE were optimized using a stepwise approach. First, the pH of the buffer was optimized and then the magnesium concentration and finally the concentration of NaCl (Fig. 3). The 3′-fluorescein-labeled substrate for all of these experiments was p-BR13-Fl. Preliminary experiments that used published conditions (29McDowall K.J. Kaberdin V.R. Wu S.W. Cohen S.N. Lin-Chao S. Nature. 1995; 374: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) to compare the hydrolysis of BR13 (radiolabeled at 5′ end) with and without fluorescein at the 3′ end found that the rates of the reactions were comparable, suggesting that this label at the 3′ end does not have a significant effect on hydrolysis by the NTH of RNaseE (data not shown). The plot of the reaction rate against pH was bell-shaped (panel A), indicating that catalysis requires both unprotonated and protonated functional groups. By fitting the pH rate profile to a double ionization equation (see Equation 1) using non-linear regression analysis, the values of pKa of these groups were estimated to be 8.16 and 8.62. The optimum pH was found to be 8.3. The optimum concentration of Mg2+ in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl was found to be between 15 and 25 mm (panel B). Although the highest “average” rate value was obtained for 20 mm Mg2+, there is no statistically significant difference in the values between 15 and 25 mm Mg2+ as indicated by the overlap in the error bars. The effect of salt on the rate of RNA hydrolysis by RNaseE was also investigated in a buffer containing 15 mm Mg2+, and the optimum concentration was found to be between 100 and 200 mm (panel C). Monovalent ions such as Na+ tend to affect the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions by serving as bulk electrolytes that interact with charged surface residues rather than serving specific structural or catalytic roles, whereas divalent ions can serve both types of role. The role of Mg2+ divalent metals ions in the reaction catalyzed by RNaseE is being investigated further and will be reported elsewhere. Measurement of Michaelis-Menten Parameters—We next determined the Michaelis-Menten parameters for hydrolysis of p-BR13-Fl by the NTH of RNaseE in 25 mm Bis-Tris-propane-HCl, pH 8.3, containing 15 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm NaCl (Fig. 4, panel A).

Their linkage and relationship, however, remain unclear. Here we found that 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) could induce cell apoptosis via induction of TR3 and E2F1 expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Addition of antisense E2F1 could partially rescue the TR3-mediated cell apoptosis, and transfection of the TR3 dominant-negative plasmid could block the TR3-induced E2F1 expression. These data suggest that TPA is able to induce LNCaP cell apoptosis via induction of TR3 resulting in the induction of E2F1. Promoter reporter assays show that TR3 can induce E2F1 expression via binding to the TR3 response element (TR3RE) in the E2F1 promoter –316 to –324 bp region. TR3 can bind specifically to this TR3RE with a Kd of 6.29 nm, and mutations of this E2F1-TR3RE can partially block the TR3-mediated E2F1 expression. Taken together, these data suggest that TPA is able to induce cell apoptosis via a TPA → TR3 → E2F1 → apoptosis pathway in LNCaP cells. Further studies of how to modulate this pathway may allow us to better understand how to control the prostate cancer growth.

Kokontis J. Liao S.S. Chang Y. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), is the human homologue of mouse Nur-77 (2Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl.

Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). TR3 is also involved in the regulation of apoptosis in various cell types (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Liu Z.G.

Res. 1994; 6: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar). TR3 is rapidly induced during apoptosis of immature thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas and has been shown to be crucial in the T-cell receptor-mediated apoptosis in these cells (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). TR3 has been shown to activate transcription through TR3 (NGFIB)-binding response element (TR3RE or NBRE) that was initially identified by genetic selection in yeast (12Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The TR3RE contains the hexanucleotide AGGTCA, which is typically recognized by nuclear receptors of retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor superfamily (13Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar), and it includes two A residues preceding this hexanucleotide. Recognition of these two residues was shown to depend on TR3 sequences that lie outside the zinc finger domain (14Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). TR3 usually binds to TR3RE as a monomer (12Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 14Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and was also reported to activate pro-opiomelanocortin gene through another TR3 (Nur-77) response element, NurRE, as a homodimer (15Philips A. Lesage S. Gingras R. Maira M.H. Gauthier Y. Hugo P. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5946-5951Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TR3 was also shown to form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor and to confer 9-cis-retinoic acid-dependent transcription to a reporter containing direct repeat (DR) 5 regulator element and TR3RE sequence (16Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The E2F family of transcription factors regulates expression of diverse mammalian genes for normal proliferation (17Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1981) Google Scholar). Normal control of E2F activity is lost in many tumors, suggesting the central role of E2F in cell cycle control (18Hall M. Peters G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the well established proliferative effect of E2F, one member of the family, E2F1, has been shown to mediate cell apoptosis (19Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). This property of E2F1 is unique because other family members of E2F are not believed to directly induce apoptosis (20DeGregori J. Leone G. Miron A. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7245-7250Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). In the retinoblastoma protein-null mice, the apoptosis associated with loss of retinoblastoma protein function was shown to be efficiently rescued by deletion of E2F1, strongly supporting a role for E2F1 in apoptosis (21Tsai K.Y. Hu Y. Macleod K.F. Crowley D. Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 293-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). E2F1 was later found to induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines, and this is separable from the effects of this protein on cell cycle progression (22Phillips A.C. Bates S. Ryan K.M. Helin K. Vousden K.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mice lacking E2F1 develop a broad unusual spectrum of tumors (23Yamasaki L. Jacks T. Bronson R. Goillot E. Harlow E. Dyson N.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The proliferation of prostate cells and prostate cancer largely depends on the presence of androgen (24Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Cooke P.S. Mee S. Bigsby R.M. Higgins S.J. Sugimura Y. Endocr. Rev. 1987; 8: 338-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The androgen effect is usually mediated by androgen receptors (25Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Science. 1988; 240: 324-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Deprivation of androgens leads to increased cell death or apoptosis (26Isaacs J.T. Lundmo P.I. Berges R. Martikainen P. Kyprianou N. English H.F. J. Androl. 1992; 13: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar, 27Buttyan R. Zakeri Z. Lockshin R. Wolgemuth D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In the castrated rat prostate, many genes including c-myc, c-fos, c-jun, HSP70, and TGF-β have been reported to be up-regulated (27Buttyan R. Zakeri Z. Lockshin R. Wolgemuth D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 2: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the molecules and mechanisms that mediate apoptosis in the prostate. Although androgen deprivation has been a standard means of hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer patients, the molecular mechanism of androgen deprivation-induced prostatic apoptosis remains largely unknown. Both TR3 and E2F1 mediate cancer cell apoptosis (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A.

Res. 1994; 6: 203-210PubMed Google Scholar); however, the linkage between them is unclear. We have reported previously that both the addition of androgen and the removal of androgen by castration induce expression of TR3 in the prostate and that antisense TR3 can increase LNCaP cell viability (10Uemura H. Chang C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that TR3 regulates the apoptosis by directly binding and up-regulating E2F1 in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. Plasmids—TR3 expression plasmid pSG5-TR3 was constructed in our laboratory and reported previously (28Mu X.M. Young W.J. Liu Y.X. Uemura H. Chang C. Endocrine. 1998; 9: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Doxycycline inducible pBIG expression vector pBIG2i was described previously (29Strathdee C.A. McLeod M.R. Hall J.R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 229: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The pBIG-E2F1 antisense plasmid was constructed by inserting an E2F1 antisense fragment in the BamHI site of the pBIG2i vector. Dominant-negative TR3 (DN-TR3) expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Winoto. Constructs of pE2F1a, pE2F1c, and pE2F1d were kindly provided by Dr. Stephan Safe. pE2F1b and pE2F1a with TR3RE mutation (pE2F1b) were made by PCR. Cell Culture and Transfections—Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 5% fetal calf serum. Human prostate cancer LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing the above concentrations of penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were transfected by using Superfect™ according to the manufacturer's procedures (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Cell Viability—Cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and then the medium was changed after 24 h and was supplemented with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) at varying concentrations. After TPA treatment, the cells were washed with PBS, trypsinized, collected, and resuspended in fresh medium, and viable cells were counted using 0.4% trypan blue staining. Northern and Western Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and Northern blot was performed as described previously (30Mu X. Liu Y. Collins L.L. Kim E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23877-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). E2F1 antibody (KH95) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (30Mu X. Liu Y. Collins L.L. Kim E. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23877-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—In vitro translation products were prepared using the TnT-coupled reticulocytes lysate system (Promega). EMSA was performed as described previously (28Mu X.M. Young W.J. Liu Y.X. Uemura H. Chang C. Endocrine. 1998; 9: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The E2F1-TR3RE sequence and its complement were 32P-labeled and used for the probe. Oligonucleotides (sense strand) used for EMSA are E2F1-TR3RE, 5′-TATAGAAAGGTCAGTGGG-3′, and mutant E2F1-TR3RE, 5′-TATAGAAAGCTCCGTGGG-3′. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—LNCaP cells were treated with 300 μm etoposide for 2 h or with 5 mm TPA for 4–12 h. Total RNAs were extracted, and cDNA syntheses were performed using Superscript™ II RNase H– reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time quantitative RT-PCRs were performed using an iCycler real-time PCR amplifier (Bio-Rad). Each PCR reaction contained 1 μl of cDNA, 50 μm primers, and 12.5 μl of IQTM SYBER green supermix reagent (Bio-Rad), and each reaction was triplicated. The primers for TR3 are 5′-GACGGCTACACAGGAGAG-3′ and 5′-AACTTGAAGGAGGCAGAGG-3′. Primers for E2F1 are 5′-AAGTCCAAGAACCACATC-3′ and 5′-CCATAACCATCTGCTCTG-3′. Primers for E2F3 are 5′-TTCAACCAACTCAGGACATAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGAGGCTCAGGAGATAGTC-3′. The results were normalized with β-actin. Establishment of Stable Clones Expressing Antisense E2F1 and E2F1 Promoter Luciferase—For stable clones expressing antisense E2F1, LNCaP cells were plated on 100-cm dishes and were transiently transfected with either 10 μg of pBIG-antisense E2F1 plasmid or pBIG2i vector. Clones resistant to hygromycin B (75 μg/ml) were isolated, expanded, and assayed for E2F1 expression after induction of doxycycline. For stable clones expressing E2F1 promoter luciferase, LNCaP cells were plated on 100-cm dishes and were transfected with a mixture (1:1 molar ratio) of E2F1–728 promoter reporter vector (pE2F1a) and pcDNA plasmid (Invitrogen) carrying a neomycin resistance gene (a total of 10 μg of DNA). Geneticin-resistant (300 μg/ml) clones were isolated, expanded, and assayed for luciferase activity. Induction of TR3 and E2F1 Gene Expression and Cell Death by TPA in Prostate Cancer LNCaP Cells—Prostate cancer PC-3 cell growth is androgen-independent, and LNCaP cell growth is androgen-sensitive. We studied the effect of TPA on these two prostate cancer cell lines and studied molecules that mediate the TPA effect. We first found that TPA could strongly induce cell death in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A, lane 4 versus lane 3) but not in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2 versus lane 1). These contrasting effects of TPA raised our interest to further examine cell death-related gene expression in these two cell lines. To our surprise, we found that both TR3 and transcription factor E2F1 were greatly induced in LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1B). As a control, epithelial growth factor (EGF) has only a marginal effect on the induction of E2F1. These results are consistent with TPA differentially induced cell death in these two prostate cell lines. The EGF has been known to induce TR3 expression, yet fails to induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells (31Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Combined with previous findings showing that both TR3 and E2F1 could mediate the apoptosis process in several cells and tissues (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A.

Dominant-negative of TR3 Can Abolish E2F1 Induction—We have reported previously that antisense TR3 could increase prostate cancer cell viability in the presence of the apoptosis inducer etoposide (10Uemura H. Chang C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 2329-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other reports also showed that the inhibition of TR3 activity by expression of a DN-TR3 or its antisense RNA may result in the inhibition of apoptosis (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M.

Mercola D. Zhang X.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4719-4731Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the effect of DN-TR3 on E2F1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1C, TPA, which induces apoptosis in LNCaP cells, showed significant induction of E2F1 expression (Fig. 1C, lane 3 versus lane 1). Cotransfection of a plasmid-encoding DN-TR3 abolished this TPA-induced E2F1 expression (Fig. 1C, lane 6 versus lane 3). As controls, Fig. 1C also showed that EGF had only a marginal effect on E2F1 expression (lane 2 versus lane 1), and 17β-estradiol (E2) showed strong induction of E2F1 expression (lane 4 versus lane 1). We also used quantitative real-time RT-PCR to examine the effect of etoposide, another LNCaP cell apoptosis inducer, on the expression of E2F1 and E2F3 expression after TPA treatment. As shown in Fig. 1D, etoposide could also induce TR3 (lane 2 versus lane 1) and E2F1 expression (lane 4 versus lane 3), and the transfection of plasmid-encoding DN-TR3 partially abolished this etoposide-induced E2F1 expression (lane 5 versus lane 4). In contrast, the E2F3 mRNA level is not significantly changed after TPA treatment (Fig. 1E, lane 2 versus lane 1) Together, results from Fig. 1, C, D, and E, suggest that TR3 may mediate TPA-induced cell apoptosis via E2F1 expression in LNCaP cells. Expression of E2F1 Antisense Can Reduce TPA-induced Cell Death in LNCaP Cells—To further confirm that TPA-induced cell death is mediated by E2F1, we established a LNCaP cell line stably transfected with pBIG-E2F1 antisense expression plasmid under the control of doxycycline (pBIG-E2F1 antisense-LNCaP) and stably transfected LNCaP cells with pBIG vector (pBIG-LNCaP) as a control. As shown in Fig. 2A, E2F1 expression was effectively inhibited by induction of E2F1 antisense expression using doxycycline in pBIG-E2F1 antisense-LNCaP (lane 4 versus lane 3) compared with pBIG-LNCaP (lane 2 versus lane 1). Induction of E2F1 antisense expression can partially rescue TPA-induced cell death (Fig. 2B, lane 4 versus lane 3), compared with no obvious effect on the TPA-induced cell death in pBIG-LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B, lane 2 versus lane 1) suggesting that E2F1 could mediate TPA-induced cell death in LNCaP cells. TR3 Specifically Binds with High Affinity to TR3 Response Element in the Promoter of E2F1—Previous studies have identified multiple SP-1 and E2F binding sites in the E2F1 gene promoter (33Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 34van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18367-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We analyzed the E2F1 promoter sequence and found a typical TR3RE in the –316 to –324 region. An EMSA shows that TR3 specifically binds to E2F1-TR3RE (Fig. 3A, lane 4, arrow), and binding can be competed out by a 10- and 100-fold excess of cold E2F1-TR3RE (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6) but not by 10- and 100-fold mutated cold E2F1-TR3RE (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). The TR3RE-TR3 complex can be supershifted by the anti-TR3 antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 9, arrowhead) but not by the anti-TR2 antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 10). Two nucleotide mutations in the TR3RE of the E2F1 gene promoter abolish the binding of TR3 to the E2F1-TR3RE (Fig. 3A, lane 11). We further determined the binding affinity of TR3 with E2F1-TR3RE using a Scatchard plot by EMSA. The typical EMSA pattern of the protein-DNA complex formed between an increasing amount of E2F1-TR3RE probe (0.0039–2 ng) and a fixed amount of TR3 is shown in Fig. 3B. The radioactivity of the specific complex (bound) and unbound (free) probe was quantified for the subsequent Scatchard plot analysis. The results are consistent with a single binding population for the specific DNA-protein complex with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 6.29 nm and B max of 0.25 nm (Fig. 3C). TR3 and TPA Up-regulates E2F1 Promoter Activity—Transient transfection in PC-3 and LNCaP cells of pE2F1a, a construct containing the –728/+77 region of E2F1 gene promoter linked to a luciferase (Luc) reporter gene, and TR3 expression plasmid pSG5-TR3 was then used to study potential roles of TR3 in regulating E2F1 promoter activity. As shown in Fig. 4, TR3 could up-regulate E2F1 gene expression in PC-3 (A) and LNCaP (B) cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1). As a control, both androgen receptor and progesterone receptor (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 6–8 versus lane 5) show little effect on the E2F1 promoter activity. We also transfected pE2F1a into LNCaP cells and treated the cells with 5 mm TPA. As shown in Fig. 4C, lane 2 versus lane 1, TPA could strongly induce E2F1 promoter activity. Furthermore, we established LNCaP cells stably transfected with pE2F1a-Luc (E2F1a-Luc-LNCaP). As shown in Fig. 4D, lane 2 versus lane 1, 5 mm TPA could strongly induce the Luc activity in E2F1a-Luc-LNCaP cells. Transfection of TR3 expression plasmid showed dose-dependent induction of Luc activity (Fig. 4E, lanes 2–4 versus lane 1) in E2F1a-Luc-LNCaP cells. As a control, the progesterone receptor (Fig. 4E, lanes 6–8 versus lane 5) shows little change in the Luc activity in E2F1a-Luc-LNCaP cells. Mutation and Deletion of E2F1-TR3RE in the Human E2F1 Promoter Abolish the Up-regulation of E2F1 by TR3—To determine whether the up-regulation of E2F1 gene promoter activity by TR3 is through E2F1-TR3RE, we created pE2F1b by mutation of two nucleotides in the TR3RE of pE2F1a. These two nucleotide mutations resulted in the inability of TR3 to bind to E2F1-TR3RE in the EMSA assay (Fig. 3, lane 11). As shown in Fig. 5, the transient transfection in LNCaP (B) and PC-3 (C) cells of pE2F1b and pSG5-TR3 showed that the mutation of TR3RE partially abolished the up-regulation of E2F1 by TR3 (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 6–8 versus lanes 2–4). We also used pE2F1c and pE2F1d, two E2F1 promoter reporter genes with the deletion of TR3RE, to determine that the up-regulation of E2F1 gene promoter activity by TR3 is through TR3RE. As shown in Fig. 5, transient transfection in LNCaP (B) and PC-3 (C) cells of pE2F1c and pE2F1d showed that these two E2F1 gene promoters with deletion of TR3RE do not respond to TR3 (Fig. 5, B and C, lanes 10–12 versus lane 9 and lanes 14–16 versus lane 13). Furthermore, the induction of E2F1 promoter activity by TPA was greatly reduced by the replacement of wild type E2F1 promoter reporter pE2F1a with TR3RE mutated reporter pE2F1b (Fig. 5D, lane 2 versus lane 4). Altogether, the data from Fig. 5 suggested that the up-regulation of E2F1 promoter activity by TR3 was through E2F1-TR3RE. E2F1 gene expression is tightly regulated during the cell cycle. A slight overexpression of E2F1 could interfere with the cell cycle and induce extensive apoptosis. It has been known that E2F1 may go through both p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways to induce cell apoptosis. The p53-dependent pathway may involve the E2F1-mediated human tumor suppressor protein p14ARF, which neutralizes HDM2 (the human homologue of MDM2) and thereby stabilizes p53 protein (35Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-29891Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The p53-independent pathway involves induction of p73 by E2F1 (36Irwin M. Marin M.C. Phillips A.C. Seelan R.S. Smith D.I. Liu W. Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Jacks T. Vousden K.H. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Nature. 2000; 407: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). However, the factors that cause overexpression of E2F1 are largely unknown. TR3 is not expressed constitutively and is rapidly expressed only under certain kinds of stimulation. The central role of TR3 on T-cell receptor-mediated apoptosis in normal thymic-negative selection has been well established (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 6Liu Z.G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E2F1 has also been reported to mediate the apoptosis induced by T-cell receptor activation. E2F1-deficient mice have a thymocyte apoptosis defect (37Field S.J. Tsai F.Y. Kuo F. Zubiaga A.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Livingston D.M. Orkin S.H. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 549-561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of the cooperative effect between TR3 and E2F1. Multiple SP1 sites, CCAAT motifs, and E2F1 binding sites have been identified in human E2F1 promoter (33Johnson D.G. Ohtani K. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 34van Ginkel P.R. Hsiao K.M. Schjerven H. Farnham P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18367-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Wang et al. (32Wang W. Dong L. Saville B. Safe S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1373-1387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that E2 could activate E2F1 gene expression through estrogen receptor but failed to identify estrogen receptor response element in the promoter. We also observed strong activation of the E2F1 promoter by the estrogen receptor and E2F1 (data not shown). The identification of TR3RE in the E2F1 promoter could represent a new regulatory mechanism of E2F1 expression. We also analyzed the promoter sequences of other E2Fs, and we failed to find any TR3 sites in the promoter regions of other E2Fs, suggesting that TR3-modulated E2F1 may be selective among E2Fs. Under normal conditions, E2F1 may mainly involve cell cycle regulation in cooperation with retinoblastoma protein and dimerization partner proteins. In some adverse conditions, TR3 is greatly and rapidly induced. TR3 could bind to E2F1-TR3RE in E2F1 promoter and enhance E2F1 expression. The overexpression of E2F1 could induce apoptosis through certain pathways. Thus, TR3-E2F1 constitutes a protective mechanism to push abnormal prostate cells into apoptosis and to prevent these cells from becoming cancer cells. As LNCaP cells are androgen-sensitive and less malignant, perhaps this TR3-E2F1 mechanism exists in LNCaP cells. PC-3 cells are androgen-independent and more malignant than LNCaP cells. Because TR3 cannot be induced in PC-3 cells, the TR3-E2F1 pathway does not exist in PC-3 cells. This could explain why TPA induces strong cell death in LNCaP cells but not in PC-3 cells. In this study we used TPA as a potent apoptosis inducer in LNCaP cells. The other apoptosis inducers, such as calcium ionophore A23187, MM11453, or MM11364, which induce apoptosis in prostate cancer LNCaP cells, can also induce TR3 expression (31Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D. Lin B. Chen G. Lu J. Lin F. Xie Z. Fontana J.A. Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) suggesting the important role of TR3 in the apoptosis of LNCaP cells. It is possible that TPA-induced apoptosis is mediated by multiple pathways. This could explain why we only observed partial rescue of TPA-induced cell death by antisense E2F1 expression. Most previous studies came to the conclusion that DNA binding and transactivation are required for the apoptotic effects of TR3 (5Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 8Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 12Wilson T.E.

Reed J.C. Zhang X. Science. 2000; 289: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar) recently reported that TR3 might induce apoptosis through translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria resulting in cytochrome c release and that transactivation of TR3 is not required for apoptosis. Katagiri et al. (38Katagiri Y. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) also reported that nerve growth factor induced TR3 translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. It is likely that TR3 mediates apoptosis through both transactivation-dependent and -independent pathways. In summary, we found that TR3 mediated apoptosis through directly binding to E2F1-TR3RE and that it up-regulated E2F1 expression in human prostate LNCaP cells. Further studies of the TR3-E2F1-apoptosis pathway would assist us in learning how to control prostate cancer growth and progression."

The neuroendocrine hypothalamus mediates homeostasis by regulating peptidergic hormone secretion of the pituitary. Discrete hypothalamic secretory neurons mediate this function.

OT and VP neurons project to the posterior pituitary, where they release hormones directly into the bloodstream, whereas the CRH, TRH, and somatostatin neurons project to the median eminence, which in turn carries their secreted hormones to the anterior pituitary to modulate pituitary secretion (1Kandel E.R. Shwartz J.H. Jessell T.M. Principle of Neuroscience. 3rd ed. Appleton & Lange, East Norwalk, CT1991Google Scholar). Despite extensive studies of the physiological functions of these hormones, the molecular pathways directing their expression in specific cell lineages are less well known. Analyses of Sim1 and Arnt2 mutant mice have demonstrated that these transcription factors are essential for the terminal differentiation of the aforementioned neurons (2Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T.

These genes belong to the family of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)/PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) domain-containing proteins, many of which are important regulators of development and physiology (14Crews S.T. Fan C.-M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). DNA binding assays in vitro have demonstrated that SIM1 and ARNT2 form heterodimers and bind the core sequence TACGTC, named central nervous system midline enhancer (CME) (3Michaud J.L. DeRossi C. May N.R. Holdener B.C. Fan C.-M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 12Hirose K. Morita M. Ema M. Mimura J. Hamada H. Fujii H. Saijo Y. Gotoh O. Sogawa K.

Stahl S. Crews S. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 171-189PubMed Google Scholar). The CME was originally identified in the enhancer regions of sim/tango downstream genes (13Sonnenfeld M. Ward M. Nystrom G. Mosher J. Stahl S. Crews S. Development. 1997; 124: 4571-4582PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wharton Jr., K.A. Franks R.G. Kasai Y. Crews S.T.

When linked to a minimal adenovirus major late promoter-driven reporter gene, CME can also mediate SIM1/ARNT2-dependent transcriptional activation of the reporter in cultured mammalian cells, albeit weakly (17Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Deletion analyses of SIM1 and ARNT2 demonstrate that their basic domains are required for CME recognition, their bHLH/PAS domains for heterodimerization, and their C termini for transcriptional regulation (9Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 12Hirose K.

However, when the SIM1 C terminus is fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and tested in a different cell line using a Gal4-thymidine kinase promoter-driven reporter, it acts as a repressor (9Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These results suggest that SIM1 can act as a repressor or an activator depending on the context of the reporter assay. Brn2, a POU domain-encoding gene, is a downstream target of SIM1/ARNT2 in vivo (2Michaud J.L. Rosenquist T. May N.R. Fan C.-M.

Furthermore, Brn2 mutant mice have a selective defect in CRH-, VP-, and OT-expressing neurons (19Burbach J.P. Luckman S.M. Murphy D. Gainer H. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1197-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 20Nakai S. Kawano H. Yudate T. Nishi M. Kuno J. Nagata A. Jishage K. Hamada H. Fujii H. Kawamura K. Shiba K. Noda T.

BRN2 has also been shown to bind to the CRH promoter and to activate its transcription (22Li P. He X. Gerrero M.R. Mok M. Aggarwal A. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2483-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 23Ramkumar T. Adler S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The genes employed by SIM1/ARNT2 to specify the other neuroendocrine hormone gene expression in distinctive cell types remain unexplored. To study the molecular pathways by which Sim1 and Arnt2 control the development of the hypothalamic secretory neurons and mediate energy homeostasis, we combined an inducible gene expression system with microarray analysis to screen for their downstream targets. Below, we describe the genes identified by this screen and the resulting implications for the Sim1/Arnt2-operated molecular pathway. Plasmids—The SIM1 N-terminal bHLH/PAS domain (1044 bp from ATG to an internal EcoRV, referred to as SIMN) was fused in-frame with Gal4 or VP16 activation domains. These fusion forms of Sim1 and full-length Sim1 cDNAs were cloned into a pIRES vector (Clontech) with the Arnt2 cDNA inserted 3′ to the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) to make Sim1-IRES-Arnt2, SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2, and SimN-Gal4-IRES-Arnt2 cassettes. These cassettes were cloned into the pTRE2hyg vector (Clontech). In addition, Sim1, Arnt2, and SimN-VP16 were individually cloned into pTRE2hyg to make pTRE-Sim1, pTREArnt2, and pTRE-Sim-VP16, respectively. pTet-On and pTet-tTS (Clontech) were used for expression of the tetracycline-regulated activator rtTA and repressor tTS, respectively, to render doxycycline (Dox)-dependent regulation of pTRE-driven expression of cloned cDNAs. The CME-driven luciferase reporters pML/6C-WT and pML/6C-AM were gifts from Dr. J. Pelletier (17Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 50 ng of pSV-βgal (Invitrogen) was included in all transfections, and the β-galactosidase activity was measured (LacZ assay kit, Promega) for normalization. Cell Culture—The Neuro-2a cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium (Vitacell, American Type Culture Collection) and 10% bovine serum. FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) was used for DNA transfection. For transient transfections, each plasmid was used at 250 ng in a final 1 μg of total DNA for each well of a 6-well dish (Falcon). The plasmids used for each transfection are indicated in the figures. For a stable cell line, Neuro-2a cells were transfected with 10 μg of pTet-On and selected with 200 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) to obtain individual clones. Selected colonies were propagated and transfected with pTREhyg-Luc (Clontech) to test their Dox (1.5 μg/ml; Clontech) responsiveness by assaying inducible luciferase activity. The clone with the lowest background was transfected with 2 μg of pTRE-SN-VP16 and 10 μg of pTet-tTS and selected with 150 μg/ml hygromycin (Roche Applied Science) to obtain secondary clones. Individual clones were then tested for their Dox-regulated SIMN-VP16/ARNT2 activity by assaying for pML/6C-WT reporter activity under mock and Dox treatment conditions. Clone 37 was chosen for microarray study. Luciferase activities were measured by luciferin (Sigma) light emission using Monolight 2010 (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). Microarray Hybridization and Data Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by the QIAGEN RNeasy method. Microarray hybridization using the MG-U74v2 A gene chip was performed using a service provided by Neurologic Functional Genomics. Triplicate hybridizations with independently synthesized probes were conducted using the same batch of RNA isolated from the untreated and Dox-treated clone 37 cell lines and the parental cell line. Hybridization signals were normalized by Affymetrix Suite software. The data sets were filtered by absent and present calls using the Affymetrix Datamining tool, i.e. genes that displayed inconsistent signals within the same oligonucleotide probe set are excluded. Based on the general background of the data, genes displayed signals <30 arbitrary units under both mock and Dox treatment conditions (after normalization) were excluded for further analyses. These remaining genes were subjected to Student's t test, with p ≤ 0.05 considered significant. We arbitrarily chose a 1.7-fold increase as a cutoff threshold for selecting genes for further investigation based on Northern confirmation rate of genes displaying various fold inductions. Northern and Western Analyses—10 μg of total RNA was resolved on 1% agarose gels and transferred to GeneScreen membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for Northern hybridization. For the melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) and Tbr1 genes, fragments were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from newborn mouse brain. The primers used were 5′-ggcaacctgcactctc-3′ and 5′-catgcccaagttcatgc-3′ for the MC3R gene and 5′-gacaacctggagagaag-3′ and 5′-aactggttttgtgcc-3′ for Tbr1. For other genes, IMAGE clones were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and ResGen: Tlx2 (clone 935644), Jak2 (clone 1391934), Mtpn (clone 5579590), thyroid hormone receptor β2 (TRβ2; clone 1600024), Chrne (clone 5127017), Grin1 (clone UI-M-API-agn-g-11-0-UI), Naca (clone 2136152), and interleukin-6 receptor α (IL-6Rα; clone 1463277). Each clone was sequenced to confirm authenticity. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe is a PCR fragment obtained from Clontech. The DNA fragment of each gene was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming (Stratagene) and used for hybridization according to the protocol provided by PerkinElmer Life Sciences for using the GeneScreen membrane. Cell lysates were resolved on a 4∼15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad); transferred to a Hybond membrane (Amersham Biosciences); and probed with antibodies against the VP16 activation domain (Clontech), ARNT2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and γ-tubulin (Sigma). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) coupled with the chemiluminescence reaction (Amersham Biosciences) were used to visualize these proteins. In Situ Hybridization (ISH)—The brains of CD1 mice at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5; vaginal plug date is designated as embryonic day 0.5) were snap-frozen in OCT compound and cryosectioned at 20-μm thickness. In Fig. 6, Sim1 heterozygotes in a BL6 backcrossed background were mated to obtain E18.5 brains from Sim1 mutant and wild-type siblings for ISH. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense probes of the genes specified in the figures were synthesized using SP6, T7, or T3 polymerase and used at ∼1 μg/ml for hybridization of the brain sections according to Schaeren-Wuemers and Gerfin-Moser (24Schaeren-Wuemers N. Gerfin-Moser A. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Inducible Expression of SIM1 and ARNT2 in the Neuro-2a Cell Line—Overexpression of transcription factors should lead to changes in the expression levels of their downstream target genes. To achieve controlled SIM1/ARNT2 overexpression, we chose to use the Tet-On inducible system (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In this system, pTet-On and pTet-tTS (Fig. 1A) are used to confer tetracycline-dependent regulation of pTRE (tetracycline-responsive element)-driven genes, in this case, Sim1 and Arnt2 (Fig. 1A; diagrammed in Fig. 3A).Fig. 3Microarray analysis of SIMN-VP16/ARNT2-up-regulated genes in clone 37 cells. A, experimental schemes of microarray screen for SimN-VP16/Arnt2 downstream targets using clone 37 cells. In the absence of Dox (Dox-; mock-induced), the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer tTS bound to the tetracycline-responsive element (TRE) and repressed the transcription of SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2. In the presence of Dox (black dot, Dox+; Dox-induced), tTS dissociated from the tetracycline-responsive element, whereas the tetracycline-controlled transactivator rtTA bound to the tetracycline-responsive element and activated the transcription of SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2. Total RNA from each condition was isolated, labeled, and hybridized to microarrays, and the data were compared for differentially expressed genes under the two conditions. B, scatter plot of the entire set of gene expression data from the microarray. Each dot represents one gene. The normalized average signal intensity under the mock and Dox treatment conditions are shown on the x and y axes in arbitrary fluorescence values. Gray lines indicate the 1.7-, 2-, 10-, and 20-fold differential expression thresholds. The locations of three genes are marked: Arnt2, Jak2, and TRβ2. Up-regulation of Arnt2 is an indicator that the Dox-treated sample did contain induced SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2 transcripts. C, table illustrating the distribution of the 268 up-regulated genes into seven categories. The transcription regulators represent genes that are known to participate in regulating transcription directly. The signaling component category includes secreted peptide factors, membrane receptors, and signaling effectors. Metabolic enzymes include enzymes in known metabolic pathways. Channels and transporters include neurotransmitter receptors or transporters for small molecules. The cell adhesion and migration category includes adhesion molecules, extracellular matrix proteins, and guidance molecules for cell migration and axonal projection. The miscellaneous group includes genes with documented functions not overlapping with the above categories, e.g. immunity-related proteins. The uncharacterized genes are expressed sequence tags in the data base whose functions have not been investigated. The functional categories and the number of genes within each category are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reasoned to implement this system in a neuronal cell line, as we are interested in the function of Sim1/Arnt2 in the hypothalamus. Because the SIM1 C terminus has been reported to repress or activate transcription in different contexts (9Ema M. Morita M. Ikawa S. Tanaka M. Matsuda Y. Gotoh O. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Hamada H. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5865-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), we surveyed the activity of SIM1/ARNT2 in various neuronal cell lines using the CME-driven luciferase reporter (pML/6C-WT) assay devised by Moffett and Pelletier (17Moffett P. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SIM1 and ARNT2 together activated this reporter expression in NB41A3, N1E-115, and Neuro-2a cells in a CME-dependent manner (data not shown). The Neuro-2a cells were chosen for further study due to their homogeneous morphology and high transfection efficiency. Under the various Dox treatment conditions tested, we observed an optimal ∼4-fold activation of the pML/6C-WT reporter by SIM1 and ARNT2 in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 1B), regardless of whether they were expressed from a single plasmid linked by the IRES or from separate plasmids (data not shown). Concerned that their activity might be too low to activate endogenous genes for our assay, we constructed a potent SIM1 fusion activator. Sim1 hybrid constructs with the SIM1 C terminus replaced by the Gal4 and VP16 (SIMN-VP16) activation domains were cloned into the pTRE2hyg vectors pTRE-SNGal4 and pTRE-SN-VP16, respectively (Fig. 1A). Arnt2 was placed downstream of the IRES located 3′ to these Sim1 variants for coexpression (Fig. 1A). Plasmids carrying these Sim1 variants as well as Arnt2 were transfected into Neuro-2a cells to compare their Dox-regulated proficiency in activating the pML/6C-WT reporter. Upon Dox treatment, pTRE-SN-VP16 conferred a 27-fold activation of the reporter compared with the 12- and 4-fold reporter activation rendered by pTRE-SN-Gal4 and pTRE-SF, respectively (Fig. 1B). SIMN-VP16 appears to function with similar specificity as SIM1, as it also required ARNT2 and wild-type CME sites for reporter gene activation (Fig. 1C). pTRE-SN-VP16 was therefore used to establish a stable Neuro-2a clonal cell line for Dox-inducible expression of SIMNVP16 and ARNT2 (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). One clone (clone 37) with this characteristic was obtained. As shown in Fig. 2A, this clone expressed readily detectable levels of the SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2 transcript of the predicted size of 4.2 kb upon Dox treatment. The SIMN-VP16 and ARNT2 proteins were also detected (Fig. 2B). No SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2 transcripts or SIMN-VP16 and ARNT2 proteins were found under the mock-induced conditions (Fig. 2, A and B). For the temporally regulated transcription activity of SIMN-VP16/ARNT2 in the clone 37 cells, we determined the time course of pML/6C-WT reporter activity upon Dox treatment. After 8, 16, and 24 h of Dox treatment, the achieved induction of the reporter was ∼6-, 160-, and 530-fold, respectively (Fig. 2C). Therefore, SIMN-VP16/ARNT2 transcription activity can be induced to high levels between 16 and 24 h of Dox treatment in the clone 37 cells. Genes Regulated by SIMN-VP16/ARNT2 in the Microarray Analysis—We prepared total RNA from mock- and Dox-treated clone 37 cells in parallel. Northern analysis was used to determine induction of the SimN-VP16-IRES-Arnt2 transcript prior to subjecting the RNA to microarray analysis. Fig. 3A outlines the experimental flowchart. The Affymetrix mouse chip MGU74v2 A (containing 12,000 probe sets) was used. Independent probe syntheses from the same batch of RNA and hybridizations were performed in triplicate. The data sets were normalized, analyzed, and presented as a scatter correlation plot in Fig. 3B (see “Experimental Procedures” for a detailed description). The presence of the Arnt2 gene on this chip serves as an internal control of Dox induction. A total of 268 genes displaying >1.7-fold (arbitrarily chosen) increased expression were considered significantly up-regulated by t test, with p ≤ 0.05. These 268 genes can be divided into several functional categories as summarized in Fig. 3C and described in the legend thereof. The identity of each gene and its fold induction are listed in Table I. Importantly, no significant gene expression changes were found in the parental cell lines treated with Dox versus the mock-treated clone 37 cell line, indicating that the up-regulated genes in the Dox-treated clone 37 sample are regulated by SIMN-VP16/ARNT2.Table IUp-regulated genes from microarray analysisGenBank™/EBI accession no.Gene name and descriptionChangefoldTranscription regulatorsU89489LIM domain binding 2 (Ldb2)1.74AW125812SRY box-containing gene 10 (Sox10)1.78Y08361Reversion-induced LIM gene (Ril)1.81M58566Zinc finger protein 36, C3H type-like 1 (Zfp36l1)1.81AF087035Musculin (Msc)1.81AB025922GLI-Krüppel family member GLI1 (Gli1)1.82U36576Nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 2 (Nfatc2)1.82AI931748CCR4-NOT transcription complex, subunit 7 (Cnot7)1.83AV214633POU domain, class 5, transcription factor 1 (Pou5f1)1.85D13664Osteoblast-specific factor 2 (Osf2)1.88AA864065Core-binding factor-β (Cbfb)1.93D49658LIM homeobox protein 8 (Lhx8)1.93AV369921Early growth response 1 (Egr1)2.01U61110Eyes absent 1 homolog (Drosophila) (Eya1)2.02M75953T-cell leukemia homeobox 2 (Tlx2)2.11L38622Transcription regulator, SIN3 yeast homolog B (Sin3b)2.12AJ223069Transcription factor 3 (Tcf3)2.12AF007110Transformed mouse 3T3 cell double minute 4 (Mdm4)2.14AV320880Nuclear receptor subfamily 5, A1 (Nr5a1)2.15Z35294Mature T-cell proliferation 1 (MTCP-1)2.18AF040242Nuclear antigen Sp1002.19U90538Forkhead box B1 (Foxh1)2.3Z36885Member of ETS oncogene family (ELK4)2.36U36799Retinoblastoma-like 2 (Rbl2)2.4AI956211Nascent polypeptide-associated complex α-polypeptide (Naca)2.43L09600Nuclear factor, erythroid-derived 2 (Nfe2)2.48AI843911Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (Gilz)2.51AV377670GATA-binding protein 2 (Gata2)2.56U91840Factor in the germline α (Figla)2.58X13945Lung carcinoma myc-related oncogene 12.71AB008192MAD homolog 3, Drosophila (Smad3, Dr...)2.73AW210248General transcription factor III A (Gtf3α)2.77U15548Thyroid hormone receptor β2 (Trebeta-2)2."
https://openalex.org/W2075518479,"A human fibroblast cell line with conditional p53 expression displayed a p53-dependent increase in both the protein and mRNA levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). The combination of p53 induction and IR cooperated to activate a transiently expressed human PCNA promoter-reporter gene via a p53-responsive element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies specific for p53 or p300/CREB-binding protein revealed specific p53-dependent enrichment of PCNA promoter sequences in immunoprecipitates of sheared chromatin prepared from irradiated cells. Maximal and specific association of acetylated histone H4 with the PCNA promoter also depended on p53 induction and exposure to IR. These data demonstrate p53 binding to a target site in the PCNA promoter, recruitment of p300/CREB-binding protein, and localized acetylation of histone H4 in an IR-dependent manner. These molecular events are likely to play a role in mediating activation of PCNA gene expression by p53 during the cellular response to DNA damage. The analyses indicate that the combination of p53 induction and IR activate the PCNA gene via mechanisms similar to that of p21/wild-type p53-activated factor but to a lesser extent.

Activation of p53 target genes leads to either growth arrest and subsequent DNA repair or apoptosis depending on a number of variables including the extent of DNA damage (4Prives C. Hall P.A. J.

To date, the best characterized p53 transcriptional co-activator is p300/CBP, which possesses intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity and interacts with other proteins possessing histone acetyltransferase activity (8Chan H.M.

In cells exposed to genotoxic stress, p53 expression can be correlated both directly (35Hall P.A. McKee P.H. Menage H.D. Dover R. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 203-207PubMed Google Scholar, 36Xu J.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4657-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar) with levels of PCNA. These seemingly conflicting results are supported by findings with transient expression assays, in which co-expression of p53 produces a variable response from a reporter construct fused downstream of the human PCNA promoter (see “Discussion”). Since assays of p53 function in transiently transfected cells may not correlate with p53-mediated regulation of a gene in native chromatin (40Cook J.L. Zhang Z. Alam J. Re R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), more direct experiments are required to demonstrate regulation of the PCNA gene by p53. We showed previously that exposure of a rat fibroblast cell line to ionizing radiation (IR) increased endogenous PCNA mRNA levels and altered p53 binding to human PCNA promoter sequences in vitro (36Xu J. Morris G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Moreover, induction of a transiently expressed human PCNA promoter-reporter construct by IR required an intact p53-binding site (36Xu J. Morris G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To address mechanisms of PCNA promoter regulation in native chromatin by p53 and/or IR, we describe here results obtained with a human fibroblast cell line, TR9-7 cells, in which expression of wild-type p53 could be induced by withdrawal of tetracycline (41Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). This experimental model was used to establish regulation of the PCNA gene by p53 in vivo and, in conjunction with chromatin immunoprecipitation and real time PCR, to quantify association of p53, p300/CBP, and acetylated histones with the PCNA promoter. By these parameters, p53-mediated activation of the PCNA gene is enhanced in irradiated cells and qualitatively similar to that of the p21/WAF1 gene, an established transcriptional target of p53. Plasmids—The PCNA-CAT reporter constructs contained human PCNA promoter sequences –249 to +62 or –213 to +62 relative to the transcriptional initiation site (+1) fused upstream of the reporter sequences in pBACAT as previously described (42Morris G.F. Bischoff J.R. Mathews M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Plasmid pC53-SN3 expresses human wild type p53 from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (43Diller L. Kassel J. Nelson C.E. Gryka M.A. Litwak G. Gebhardt M. Bressac B. Ozturk M. Baker S.J. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). pON260 expresses β-galactosidase from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter (44Spaete R.R. Mocarski E.S. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 135-143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Irradiation of Cells—TR9-7 cells (41Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) are a human fibroblast cell line that expresses human wild type p53 from a tetracycline-repressible promoter in a p53 null background. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) with 10% FBS (v/v), 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, 600 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen), and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma) in a humidified incubator with 10% CO2. Lower concentrations of tetracycline in the medium (from 1 μg/ml to 0 μg/ml, final concentration) were used to induce p53 expression when needed. Cells were exposed to IR at the indicated doses at a rate of 1.25 Grays/min from a cesium-137 source in a Gammacell 40 low dose rate research irradiator (MDS Nordian, Inc., Kanata, Canada). Antibodies—A sheep polyclonal antibody to p53 (Ab-7) and rabbit polyclonal antibody to p21/WAF1 (Ab-5) were purchased from Oncogene Research (Boston, MA). A mouse monoclonal antibody to PCNA (19F4) was provided by E. M. Tan (Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, San Diego, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibodies to p53 (PAb1801 and PAb421) and a goat polyclonal to actin (I-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody to an N-terminal epitope of p300 (N-15) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to acetylated histone H4 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Charlottesville, VA). Control mouse IgG and normal rabbit serum were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Transient Transfection Assays—The PCNA-CAT reporters were transfected into TR9-7 cells by the calcium phosphate method as previously described (36Xu J. Morris G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each transfection mixture contained 5 μg of the reporter plasmid. After transfection, the TR9-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 18 h before transfer to fresh medium with different tetracycline concentrations (1, 0.1, and 0 μg/ml). Immediately after changing the medium, the transfected cells were mock-exposed or exposed to the indicated doses of IR. In all transfection experiments, the cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection, and CAT activity was determined as previously described (33Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pON-260 (1 μg) was co-transfected as an internal control to monitor transfection efficiency. Assays of β-galactosidase activity were performed as described previously (45Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent TR9-7 cells were kept in medium containing 0.5% FBS for 48 h before they were put into serum-rich medium (10% FBS) with different tetracycline concentrations (1, 0.1, and 0 μg/ml) to induce p53 expression or not. Immediately after changing the medium, the cells were either exposed to 20-gray ionizing radiation or mock-irradiated as depicted in Fig. 1A. The cells were harvested at 0, 8, 24, and 32 h postirradiation, and samples for immunoblotting were prepared by resuspension of the cell pellets in 150 μl of Laemmli buffer followed by boiling for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein from each sample (46Goldring J.P. Ravaioli L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 242: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) were fractionated in a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were blocked in Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots for p53, PCNA, and p21/WAF1 were performed as previously described with the antibodies Ab-7, 19F4, and Ab-5, respectively (36Xu J. Morris G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analysis—TR9-7 cells underwent the treatments depicted in Fig. 1A. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx, Houston, TX) following the instructions provided. Northern blots were performed essentially the same as described previously (36Xu J. Morris G.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Each RNA sample of 20 μg was separated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, which was then blotted to an Immobilon-Ny+ membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The RNA blot was probed by hybridization with gel-purified fragments of 1.3-kb human PCNA cDNA, 1.0-kb human p21/WAF1 cDNA, and 1.0-kb mouse 36B4 cDNA, radiolabeled by random priming as described previously (47Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out at 68 °C overnight for all three labeled probes in hybridization buffer (5× SSPE: 0.75 m NaCl, 50 mm NaH2PO4, and 6 mm EDTA; 2% SDS; 5× Denhardt's solution; 100 μg/ml single-stranded DNA). Washing conditions were twice for 15 min at room temperature with 2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, followed by once at 68 °C for 20 min and then two washes in 0.2× SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 68 °C for 20 min each. After washing, the blot was wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to Biomax x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at –70 °C. The intensity of each mRNA signal was quantified by phosphor imager analyses (Fuji Photo Film Co., Kanagawa, Japan). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays and Real Time PCR Analyses—TR9-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% FBS and 1 μg/ml tetracycline for 48 h before changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS with or without tetracycline. Immediately after changing the medium, the cells were exposed to 20-gray IR. Sixteen hours after the various treatments (Fig. 1A), the cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and processed for chromatin immunoprecipitation as described elsewhere (48Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies specific to p53, PAb1801, and PAb421 (1 μg); a polyclonal antibody to p300 (1 μg); or 5 μl of polyclonal rabbit serum to acetylated histone H4 were used for each ChIP assay, respectively. Equal amounts of mouse IgG or normal rabbit serum were used as controls. Recovery of p53 in the ChIP assays was monitored by immmunoblotting the immunoprecipitated chromatin (see above) and probing the blot with a sheep polyclonal antibody to p53. The amount of DNA in each chromatin immunoprecipitate was quantified by real time PCR on a Bio-Rad iCycler using Sybr Green PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the primers for the PCNA+1 amplicon (Fig. 4A) are as follows: upper primer, acacgattggcccta aagtcttccc; lower primer, gaccactctgctacgcctgcaaccg. The sequences of the primers for the PCNA-p53 amplicon (Fig. 4A) are as follows: upper primer, ccaccataaagctggggcttgacga; lower primer, gcgaggcccgccccctagagcatac. The sequences of the primer for the p21+1 amplicon (Fig. 4A) are as follows: upper primer, ttgtatatcagggccgcgct; lower primer, cgaatccgcgcccagctc. The sequences of the primer for the p21-p53 amplicon (Fig. 4A) are as follows: upper primer, tccacctttcaccattcccctaccc; lower primer, cagcccaaggacaaaatagccacca. Reaction volumes were 50 μl with primer concentrations at 15 μm. Three-step PCR was performed for each amplicon with annealing temperatures as follows: 58 °C for PCNA-p53, PCNA+1, and p21-53 amplicons; 60 °C for p21+1 amplicon. Temperatures for denaturing and extension were 94 °C and 72 °C, respectively. Each step lasted 30 s. A standard curve was established for each amplicon by inputting 4- or 6-fold serial dilutions of genomic DNA recovered from sheared chromatin with a starting input of 840 ng of DNA. The threshold cycle of each experimental sample was converted to the amount of immunoprecipitated DNA by comparison with the standard curve. The portion of DNA immunoprecipitated from each sample was determined after quantifying the corresponding input by real time PCR. The values from the group of serum-starved cells without p53 induced or exposure to IR, designated as 0 h, were set arbitrarily to 1. A -fold change of each ChIP assay was obtained by comparing the remaining groups to that of 0 h. Acid Extraction of Histone and Immunoblot for Acetylated Histone H4 —TR9-7 cells were cultured and treated as described for ChIP assays. To establish a positive control for histone H4 acetylation, asynchronous TR9-7 cells were treated with 5 mm sodium butyrate for 24 h. Cells were scraped from the culture dishes and collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 5 packed cell volumes of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Sulfuric acid was added to a final concentration of 0.2 m. The suspension was then incubated on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh dialysis tube and dialyzed against 200 ml of 0.1 m acetic acid, twice for 1.5 h each. The supernatant was then dialyzed three more times against 200 ml of H2O for 1 h, 3 h, and overnight, respectively. The extracted histone was quantified and immunoblotted with an acetylated histone H4-specific antibody following the instructions of the provider (Upstate Biotechnologies). Cooperative Induction of PCNA Expression by p53 and Ionizing Radiation—TR9-7 cells, which express wild-type p53 from a tetracycline-repressible promoter (41Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar), were used as an experimental model to provide a means of independently modulating p53 expression level and activating post-translational modifications of p53 by IR. The independent and cooperative roles of p53 induction and irradiation upon regulation of two important cell cycle regulatory proteins, p21/WAF1 and PCNA, were examined in these cells. The TR9-7 cells were incubated in low serum (0.5%) and 1 μg/ml tetracycline (no p53 induction) for 48 h (Fig. 1A). Then the cells were changed into fresh medium with serum (10%) containing 0, 0.1, or 1 μg/ml tetracycline to induce different levels of p53 expression. Immunoblotting assays postinduction revealed a 4–7-fold increase in p53 levels by 8 h in cells grown in the absence of tetracycline that was maintained through the 32-h time point (Fig. 1B). Immediately after changing the media, some cells were exposed to 20 grays of γ-radiation. The effects of p53 expression and/or IR upon cellular levels of p21/WAF1 and PCNA were determined by immunoblotting total cell extracts from the untreated cells (0 h) and at 8, 24, and 32 h after the various treatments. In unirradiated cells without p53 induction, p21/WAF1 levels changed very little (Fig. 1C). Full p53 induction in unirradiated TR9-7 cells caused a gradual increase in levels of p21/WAF1, reaching a maximum at 24 h. Although exposure of the cells to IR alone produced an increase in p21/WAF1 levels (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 8), the combination of IR and p53 induction produced a larger increase (lane 10 versus lane 8). These data confirm p53-mediated regulation of a target gene in TR9-7 cells as shown previously (41Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and indicate that IR and p53 cooperate to elevate cellular p21/WAF1 levels. The effects of IR and p53 upon PCNA levels can be compared with the data for p21/WAF1 described above. In the absence of p53 induction, the levels of PCNA in unirradiated TR9-7 cells appeared higher at 24 h (Fig. 1C, lane 5), which probably reflects serum-stimulated entry into S phase. At the 24- and 32-h time points with p53 induced minus IR, PCNA levels in the serum-stimulated cells (lanes 7 and 10, respectively) appeared similar to that of serum-starved cells (lane 1). Independent of p53 induction, exposure to IR did not prevent the serum-induced increase in PCNA levels (lanes 5 and 8). In contrast to the effects of p53 induction in unirradiated cells, the combination of IR and p53 induction elevated PCNA levels at the 24- and 32-h time points (lanes 7 and 10). The augmented PCNA expression coincided with the increase in p21/WAF1 levels in the same cells. The increase of both p21/WAF1 and PCNA protein levels by p53 induction and IR is consistent with their physiological roles in the cellular response to DNA damage, participation in cell cycle arrest, and DNA repair. p53-associated elevation of PCNA protein levels at 24 and 32 h required exposure to IR and appeared to be limited relative to that of p21/WAF1. A Northern blot was performed to determine the p21/WAF1 and PCNA mRNA levels in TR9-7 cells subjected to the above experimental protocol (see Fig. 1A). Exposure to IR or p53 induction elevated p21/WAF1 mRNA levels at 16 h over that of the serum-starved control cells ∼2- and 6-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). Similar to the immunoblotting results, the combination of p53 induction and exposure to IR produced a maximal increase in p21/WAF1 mRNA levels, more than 14-fold. The addition of serum alone did not affect p21/WAF1 mRNA levels. Some similarities and differences in the regulation of p21/WAF1 and PCNA mRNA levels were observed. Consistent with a serum response (26Almendral J.M. Huebsch D. Blundell P.A. Macdonald-Bravo H. Bravo R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the addition of serum alone elevated PCNA mRNA levels 2-fold over that of the serum-starved cells (Fig. 2). In the serum-stimulated cells, IR exposure or p53 induction elevated PCNA mRNA levels about 3- and 5-fold, respectively. Similar to p21/WAF1, the combination of p53 induction and IR maximally elevated PCNA mRNA levels, ∼8-fold. With the exception of p53 induction alone, which did not increase PCNA protein levels but did increase PCNA mRNA levels, the Northern and immunoblotting assays revealed concordant regulation of the mRNAs and their respective proteins for p21/WAF1 and PCNA. Post-transcriptional regulation of PCNA expression, which may account for the disparity in PCNA mRNA and protein levels, has been previously reported (27Tommasi S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27829-27838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34Chang C.D. Ottavio L. Travali S. Lipson K.E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3289-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the combination of p53 and IR induces maximal expression of both the p21/WAF1 and the PCNA genes in serum-stimulated cells. The amplitude of induction of PCNA mRNA by the combination of p53 and IR is smaller relative to that of p21/WAF1 mRNA. Cooperative Activation of the PCNA Promoter by p53 and Ionizing Radiation—We performed transient transfection assays with PCNA-CAT reporter constructs to investigate whether or not the cooperative roles of p53 and IR in induction of PCNA expression could be manifest at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3). Neither p53 expression nor IR independently had a major effect (less than 50% change) on expression from PCNA-CAT. Consistent with PCNA protein and mRNA expression, the combination of p53 induction and IR produced a 3-fold increase in PCNA promoter-directed CAT expression by the construct with an intact p53-binding site (–249 PCNA-CAT). The construct lacking the p53-binding site (–213 PCNA-CAT) failed to respond to the combination of p53 induction and irradiation. These observations show that the cooperative effects of p53 and IR on inductio"

In vitro, CNP specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis of 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2′-nucleotides, but the physiologically relevant in vivo substrate remains obscure. Here, we report the medium resolution NMR structure of the catalytic domain of rat CNP with phosphate bound and describe its binding to CNP inhibitors. The structure has a bilobal arrangement of two modules, each consisting of a four-stranded β-sheet and two α-helices. The β-sheets form a large cavity containing a number of positively charged and aromatic residues. The structure is similar to those of the cyclic phosphodiesterase from Arabidopsis thaliana and the 2′-5′ RNA ligase from Thermus thermophilus, placing CNP in the superfamily of 2H phosphodiesterases that contain two tetrapeptide HX(T/S)X motifs. NMR titrations of the CNP catalytic domain with inhibitors and kinetic studies of site-directed mutants reveal a protein conformational change that occurs upon binding. 2′,3′-Cyclic-nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is an enzyme abundantly present in the central nervous system of mammals and some vertebrates.

This derives from the continuing failure to identify a physiological substrate for this enzyme. CNP has an apparent specificity for nucleoside 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, which it cleaves to 2′-nucleotide end products, none of which (with the exception of NADP/NADPH) are found in metabolite pools. The last 4 decades of research have failed to attribute a function to this protein, although many possibilities have been considered (extensively reviewed in Refs. 1Sprinkle T.J. Crit. Rev.

CNP and RICH share catalytic features with three other groups of enzymes: fungal/plant RNA ligases involved in tRNA splicing (7Tyc K. Kellenberger C. Filipowicz W. J. Biol.

Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have been determined. Members of this enzyme superfamily occur across a vast range of organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals. It has been suggested (16Nasr F. Filipowicz W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1676-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that all four classes of enzymes originated from a common ancestor because they all have two similarly spaced histidine-containing tetrapeptides; their catalytic domains have a similar size of ∼200 residues with similar pattern of predicted secondary structural elements; and they all catalyze hydrolysis of either 2′,3′-cyclic phosphates to 2′-phosphates or 1″,2″-cyclic phosphate to 1″-phosphate. Recently, new members of this superfamily have been identified (17Mazumder R. Iyer L.M. Vasudevan S. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Investigations of CNP have provided a variety of observations concerning the relationship of CNP to the cytoskeleton and its localization to discrete regions of oligodendrocytes and paranodal compartments of the myelin sheath, adjacent to the axon (18Braun P.E.

CNP comprises ∼4% of the central nervous system total myelin protein and is most abundant in oligodendrocytes. Recently, it has been reported that CNP binds to tubulin and that it may play a role in anchoring microtubules to the plasma membrane as well as in regulating tubulin polymerization (26Bifulco M. Laezza C. Stingo S. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1807-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A second isoform (CNP2) has also been identified, which contains a unique 20-amino acid N-terminal domain that targets the protein to mitochondria (27McFerran B. Burgoyne R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar). Also, recent studies on CNP-null mutant mice revealed that the absence of CNP causes axonal swelling and neuronal degeneration (28Lappe-Siefke C. Goebbels S. Gravel M. Nicksch E. Lee J. Braun P.E. Griffiths I.R. Nave K.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). These observations underline the importance of this enzyme in brain and point to a multifaceted role for CNP in myelinogenesis and the maintenance of the myelin-axonal interface. Here, we describe the structure of the brain CNP catalytic domain as determined by NMR and show that it is highly similar to the plant CPDase and the archaebacterial RNA ligase despite low overall similarity in amino acid sequence. This work brings us a step closer to understanding the function of CNP and its evolutionarily conserved enzymatic activity. Protein Expression and Purification—The catalytic fragment of CNP (CNP-CF, residues 164-378) was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen, Madison, WI) and expressed in the Escherichia coli expression host BL21(DE3) (Stratagene) as a His-tagged fusion protein. The protein was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography on a Ni2+-loaded chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Isotopically labeled CNP-CF was prepared from cells grown on minimal M9 medium containing [15N]ammonium chloride and/or [13C]glucose (Cambridge Isotopes Laboratory, Andover, MA). For the backbone assignments, partially deuterated triple-labeled (2H, 15N, 13C) CNP-CF was produced by expressing the protein in 90% D2O- and 10% H2O-containing minimal M9 medium. The N-terminal His tag was cleaved from CNP-CF by overnight dialysis with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) at 1 unit/mg of fusion protein at room temperature. Benzamidine-Sepharose and Ni2+-loaded chelating Sepharose were used to remove thrombin and the His tag peptide from CNP-CF. The resulting 219-amino acid protein contained four extraneous residues from the His tag. The sequence composition of purified CNP-CF was confirmed by mass spectrometry. CNP catalytic fragment mutants were created by overlap extension PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) (29Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar). The mismatched oligonucleotide sequences used to generate the mutants were as follows (only the sense oligonucleotides are listed): T232A (ACA to GCA), 5′-GTG CTG CAC TGT GCA ACC AAA TTC TGT-3′; D237V (GAC to GTC), ACC AAA TTC TGT GTC TAC GGG AAG GCC-3′; G276A (GGG to GCA), 5′-CCC AAG ACA GCT GCA GCC CAG GTG GTG-3′; A308G (GCT to GGA), 5′-CCA GGG AGC CGA GGA CAT GTC ACC CTA-3′; T311A (ACC to GCG), 5′-AGC CGA GCT CAC GTC GCG CTA GGC-3′; Q322A (CAG to GCC), 5′-GTG CAG CCA GTG GCC ACA GGC CTT GAC-3′; G324A (GGC to GCG), 5′-CCA GTG CAG ACA GCG CTT GAC CTC TTA-3′; L327A (CTC to GCG), 5′-ACA GGC CTT GAC GCG TTA GAG ATT TTA-3′; and Y376A (TAC to GCT), 5′-TTC ACG GGG GCT TAT GGG TGA GGA TCC ATT AT-3. The boldface underlined sequences correspond to the mutated codons. The authenticity of the substitutions and the absence of any undesired mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. The CNP-CF histidine mutants (H230L and H309L) were generated as previously described (6Lee J. Gravel M. Gao E. O'Neill R.C. Braun P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14804-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy—NMR resonance assignments of the catalytic fragment of CNP were determined previously (30Kozlov G. Lee J. Gravel M. Ekiel I. Braun P.E. Gehring K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). All NMR experiments were recorded at 310 K. NMR samples were 1-2 mm protein in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium azide at pH 6.0. Attempts to use Pf1 phage or compressed polyacrylamide to obtain residual dipolar coupling constraints were not successful. Nuclear Overhauser effect correlation spectroscopy (NOESY) constraints for the structure determination were obtained from 15N-edited NOESY (mixing time of 100 ms) and 13C-edited NOESY (mixing time of 100 ms) three-dimensional experiments using the Varian Inova 800-MHz spectrometer at the Canadian National High Field NMR Centre (NANUC). NMR spectra were processed with GIFA (31Pons J.L. Malliavin T.E. Delsuc M.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 8: 445-452Google Scholar) and XWINNMR Version 2.5 (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed with XEASY (32Bartels C. Xia T.-H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—For the structure determination, a set of 1925 nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were collected from 15N- and 13C-edited NOESY spectra of CNP-CF (amino acids 164-378) acquired at 800 MHz. Automated NOE assignments were made using ARIA (33Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using standard protocols in CNS Version 1.1 (34Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The starting structure for ARIA was generated using MODELLER according to the CPDase fold and was in agreement with a set of manually assigned NOEs. PROCHECK NMR was used to check the protein stereochemical geometry (35Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). The coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 1N4T), and the NMR assignments have been deposited in the BioMagResBank Database (accession number 5202). CNP-CF Titrations with Inhibitors—2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, 5′-AMP, NAD, and pyrophosphate (Na2H2P2O7) were purchased from Sigma and used without any additional purification. An RNA oligoadenylate hexanucleotide (A6) was chemically synthesized and purified by University Core DNA & Protein Services (University of Calgary, Calgary, Canada). The purity and composition of the oligonucleotide was verified by one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Titrations were monitored by 15N-1H heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) following addition of inhibitors to 15N-labeled CNP-CF (amino acids 164-378) on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz spectrometer. The sample contained 50 mm MES, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm sodium azide at pH 6.0 and ∼0.4-0.5 mm CNP-CF at 310 K. Inhibitor concentrations varied from 0.1-0.2 to 7-60 mm depending on the affinity and solubility of the inhibitor. The A6 hexanucleotide concentration varied from 0.06 to 0.9 mm. HSQC spectra were assigned by monitoring chemical shift changes upon addition of the substrate because the binding takes place in fast exchange. The pH of the NMR samples was verified during the titrations and adjusted as needed. Chemical shift changes for individual residues were fitted to a one-site binding equation using the computer program GraFit (Version 3.0, Leatherbarrow) to determine the K d of binding. CNP-CF Inhibition Assays—CNP-CF activity assays were performed using the spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay described previously (36Sogin D.C. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1333-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). CNP-CF activity was determined by monitoring the formation of NADPH at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm-1 cm-1) using a Cary UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). The assay was initiated by adding 25 ng of CNP-CF to 1 ml of assay buffer containing 50 mm MES (pH 6.0), 30 mm MgCl2, 2′,3′-cyclic NADP (Sigma), 5 mm d-glucose 6-phosphate, and 5 μg d-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Roche Diagnostics). The concentration of cyclic NADP was varied from 0.05 to 2.0 mm. The initial velocity values were obtained from the Cary WinUV enzyme kinetics application and were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation. To test the inhibition of CNP-CF by AMP analogs, 1.5, 0.75, and 0.5 mm 5′-AMP, 2′-AMP, and 3′-AMP, respectively, were included in the 1 ml of assay buffer. CNP-CF activity data in the presence and absence of inhibitors were replicated at least twice for each inhibitor. CNP Belongs to the Superfamily of 2H Phosphodiesterases—We determined the structure of the catalytic fragment of rat brain CNP (CNP-CF), the first of a vertebrate-specific 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (Fig. 1). The previously reported resonance assignments (30Kozlov G. Lee J. Gravel M. Ekiel I. Braun P.E. Gehring K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 99-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) were used to assign NOEs from 15N- and 13C-edited three-dimensional NOESY experiments. The 20 lowest energy structures of 60 calculated were chosen to represent the final ensemble. The structural statistics are shown in Table I. On average, 10.9 constraints per residue were used to calculate the CNP-CF structure. This is below the typical number of 15-20 constraints per residue in high resolution NMR structures and results from the number of unresolved overlapping NOEs and a lower sensitivity of NOESY experiments because of the relatively large protein molecular mass (24.3 kDa). The tendency of CNP-CF to aggregate also limited the protein concentration in NMR samples.Table IStructural statistics for the CNP catalytic fragmentRestraints for structure calculationsTotal restraints used2338Total NOE restraints1925Intraresidual763Sequential (|i-j| = 1)523Medium range (1 <|i-j| < 5)264Long range (|i-j| ≥ 5)375Hydrogen bond restraints87Dihedral angle restraints326r.m.s.aRoot mean square. deviations from experimental restraintsDistance deviations (Å)0.021 ± 0.0007Dihedral deviations1.055 ± 0.0566°Deviations from idealized geometryBonds (Å)0.0022 ± 0.0001Angles0.4107 ± 0.0062°Impropers0.3929 ± 0.0105°r.m.s. deviations of 20 structures from mean coordinates (Å)Backbone (residues 165-195 and 228-378)0.55 ± 0.15Heavy atoms (residues 165-195 and 228-378)1.28 ± 0.15Backbone (residues 165-378)1.09 ± 0.31Heavy atoms (residues 165-378)1.59 ± 0.30Ramachandran plot statistics for residues 169-372 (%)Residues in most favored regions75.8Residues in additional allowed regions23.9Residues in generously allowed regions0.3a Root mean square. Open table in a new tab The structure shows a bilobal arrangement of two modules, each consisting of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and two antiparallel α-helices located on the outer part of the modules (Fig. 1b). The first lobe consists of strands β1, β2, β6, and β7 and helices α2 and α3, whereas the second one consists of strands β3, β4, β5, and β8 and helices α1 and α4. The internal face of the modules forms a large cavity. Intense peaks in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of CNP-CF indicate a flexible backbone for residues from Gly208 to Lys214. Coupled with low NOE density for this region, this loop between helix α1 and strand β2 appears to be mobile. The structure has a striking similarity to CPDase from A. thaliana (12Hofmann A. Zdanov A. Genschik P. Ruvinov S. Filipowicz W. Wlodawer A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6207-6217Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and to 2′-5′ RNA ligase from T. thermophilus (15Kato M. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Yamaguchi H. Murayama K. Sakai H. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Topologically, CNP-CF differs only in an extra C-terminal strand β8 that extends the antiparallel β-sheet containing strand β3 (Fig. 1c). One possible role of this β-strand is to place the N and C termini on the opposite sides of the CNP domain and to position the CNP C-terminal isoprenylation site at the membrane. The structural similarity of CNP-CF provides direct evidence that CNP belongs to the superfamily of phosphodiesterases containing dual catalytic tetrapeptide HX(T/S)X motifs. CNP-CF has a more open cavity than CPDase. This difference suggests that a larger natural ligand could exist for CNP. Sequence comparison (Fig. 2) provides possible explanations for the more closed CPDase structure. The turns between strands β3-β4 and β6-β7 in CPDase make hydrophobic contacts with each other via side chains of Phe84 and Leu168 and limit the size of the catalytic cavity. The β3-β4 turn in CPDase is very hydrophobic, with a triplet of phenylalanine residues, Phe82, Phe83, and Phe84, whereas both turns in CNP-CF are hydrophilic and positively charged, suggesting that they are solvent-exposed and may be involved in interactions with a negatively charged ligand. Interestingly, the 2′-5′ RNA ligase has hydrophilic turns and an open conformation similar to that of CNP. This conformation likely allows RNA to access the catalytic site (15Kato M. Shirouzu M. Terada T. Yamaguchi H. Murayama K. Sakai H. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Binding of CNP Inhibitors—To obtain more information about the active site of CNP, we titrated 15N-labeled CNP-CF with several compounds previously shown to inhibit CNP activity (reviewed in Ref. 1Sprinkle T.J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 4: 235-301PubMed Google Scholar). These included orthophosphate, pyrophosphate, 2′-AMP, 3′-AMP, 5′-AMP, β-NAD, and NADP. The titrations were monitored by 1H-15N correlation spectroscopy, and shifts of amide signals as a function of ligand addition were recorded. These shifts act as a fingerprint and identify amino acid residues affected by binding (Fig. 3a). Titration of the catalytic fragment of CNP with orthophosphate resulted in chemical shift changes, indicating that it binds to CNP and was present in the structure determined by NMR. The biggest 1H and 15N amide chemical shift changes were observed for Thr232 (0.56), Thr311 (0.53), Gly324 (0.24), Val228 (0.21), Ala308 (0.17), His230 (0.16), Gly305 (0.15), and Thr323 (0.15). Thr232, Thr311, and His230 are part of the tetrapeptide motifs, which are important for the catalytic activity. This shows that the phosphate group binds in the active site. The catalytic threonines, Thr232 and Thr323, likely coordinate the phosphate moiety through hydrogen bonds. The chemical shift changes correlate with the regions of highest sequence conservation in the catalytic domains of CNP from different species (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, CNP-inhibitor interactions were pH-dependent. The chemical shift changes upon phosphate binding were much smaller at pH 6.5 (and above) than at pH 6.0 (data not shown). The likely reason for this is deprotonation of the catalytic histidines or the phosphoryl group. This would change the electrostatic charges and interfere with hydrogen bonding to the phosphate ion. In support of this, the CNP enzymatic activity was optimal at pH 5.5-6.5 and decreased at higher pH (data not shown). Whether this reflects protonation of active-site histidine(s) or the substrate phosphoryl group remains to be determined. The binding of AMPs resulted in a pattern of chemical shift changes very similar to that observed upon binding of phosphate (Fig. 3a). The relatively larger shifts observed for AMPs reflect the stronger binding to CNP-CF. The AMP titrations also allowed us to identify additional residues affected by binding. Located in the loop between strand β2 and helix α2, Cys236 and Asp237 showed minor chemical shift changes. These residues are relatively close to the tetrapeptide motifs and could participate in substrate recognition by interacting with the mobile loop Gly208-Lys214. Speculatively, Asp237 could interact with either Lys212 or Lys214 to close the mobile loop upon substrate binding. However, this loop is poorly conserved among mammalian CNPs (Fig. 4b) and shows relatively small changes upon inhibitor binding (Fig. 3a), suggesting that either the loop does not function as a flap or that it needs the proper substrate for specific loop-ligand interactions. The titration experiments also allowed us to compare binding affinities of CNP inhibitors. In the weak binding (fast exchange) regime, the signals in HSQC spectra gradually move from the unbound position to the fully bound position depending on the amount of inhibitor added. These changes can be fitted using the binding equation to estimate the dissociation constant (K d). The dissociation constants obtained from NMR titrations are shown in Table II. The results show that 3′-AMP has the highest affinity for the CNP catalytic domain, followed by 2′-AMP and 5′-AMP. This might reflect differences in the pK a of the phosphoryl group in the different AMPs or may be an inherent property of the CNP catalytic site. Studies at a second pH are needed to resolve the issue. Comparison of NAD and NADP shows that a terminal phosphate significantly improves binding affinity.Table IIAffinity constants for CNP-CF interactions with inhibitors as determined by NMR titration (Kd) and enzyme assays (Ki)InhibitorKdKimMmMK2HPO412.90±1.85 (Thr232)11.54±1.95 (Gly324)Na2H2P2O715.38±2.77 (Thr232)2′-AMP1.49±0.14 (Thr232)0.417±0.0121.64±0.17 (Thr311)1.61±0.16 (Gly324)3′-AMP0.57±0.04 (Thr232)0.239±0.0135′-AMP1.68±0.04 (Thr232)1.10±0.14NADP5.38±0.55 (Thr232)NAD21.19±0.72 (Thr232)A60.80 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Properties of Active-site Mutants—To define the enzymatic role of the conserved tetrapeptide motif residues, we mutated each residue individually and measured the kinetic parameters of the mutant enzymes using cyclic NADP as substrate (Table III). Consistent with our previous results (6Lee J. Gravel M. Gao E. O'Neill R.C. Braun P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14804-14813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), mutation of His230 and His309 resulted in a 15,000-fold reduction in k cat without any effect on K m, suggesting that both conserved histidines are critical for catalysis, but not for substrate binding. Mutation of Thr232 or Thr311 significantly decreased k cat by 100- and 700-fold, respectively. The Thr232 mutant also exhibited an 8-fold increase in K m, whereas the Thr311 mutant showed a minimal 3-fold increase. These results suggest that Thr232 is more critical for substrate binding, whereas Thr311 is more important for catalysis. Parallel studies with yeast CPDase showed that mutation of Ser/Thr residues in the tetrapeptide motifs has minor effects on enzymatic activity and suggested that the residues play a larger role in substrate recognition (16Nasr F. Filipowicz W.

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, mutation of the non-active site residue Gly324 (helix α4) in CNP resulted in a 5-fold increase in K m and 37-fold decrease in k cat. Mutations of other proximal residues on helix α4 such as Gln322 and Leu327 did not affect the kinetic parameters. These results agree with the NMR titration data (see below) that suggest that Gly324 is important for the conformation of helix α4. The other remaining mutants (D237V, G276A, A308G, and Y376A) displayed wild-type kinetic parameters, indicating that these residues are not particularly important for CNP activity. Inhibitor Binding Causes a Conformational Change in the CNP Catalytic Domain—NMR titrations showed ligand-induced chemical shift changes in the residues around Gly324 (Fig. 3a). These residues are located in helix α4 and relatively far from the active site. This could represent a second binding site or a minor conformational change that affects these residues through contacts with strand β5 in the active site. To distinguish between these possibilities, we compared the dissociation constants obtained by NMR for two residues, Thr232 and Gly324, using both weak (orthophosphate) and high affinity (2′-AMP) inhibitors (Table II). Identical K d values were observed for both residues, indicating a concerted conformational change that arises from a single binding site. It is very unlikely that two distinct binding sites would demonstrate identical K d values for both substrates. In helix α4, the most affected residues are Thr323 and Gly324. These amino acid types are less common in α-helices, and we speculate that the conformational change observed is elongation of the N-terminal part of helix α4 in the presence of bound substrate. The CNP Catalytic Fragment Weakly Binds Hexanucleotide RNA—An interesting feature of the CNP catalytic fragment is the presence of several aromatic (Tyr168, Phe172, Phe235, and Tyr352) and positively charged (Lys214, Lys234, and Arg307) residues in the vicinity of the active site (Fig. 5). The majority of these residues are located on the N-terminal lobe (strands β1, β2, and β7). β-Sheets with an abundance of positively charged and aromatic residues are common RNA-binding surfaces (for a review, see Ref. 37Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The presence of these residues, coupled with a large binding cavity, hints that RNA may be a CNP substrate. Furthermore, many proteins from the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily are involved in RNA-processing pathways, and some of them bind RNA (17Mazumder R. Iyer L.M. Vasudevan S. Aravind L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 5229-5243Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we titrated CNP-CF with an RNA hexanucleotide (A6). The fingerprint of A6 binding was very similar to that of phosphate and other inhibitors (Fig. 3a), but its affinity could not be determined from the NMR data because the data did not fit a simple one-site binding (data not shown). The chemical shift changes with A6 RNA were smaller than with 3′-AMP or 5′-AMP, suggesting weaker binding. Enzyme assays were used to determine the inhibition constants (K i) for the AMPs and the A6 oligonucleotide (Table II). All the inhibitors showed competitive inhibition (increased K m and unchanged V max). Because the N-terminal fragment of CNP has some homology to ATP-binding domains (38Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we also tested ATP and observed very weak inhibition, with a K i of ∼13 mm. It was previously reported that poly(A) RNA is a potent CNP inhibitor (39Sprinkle T.J. Tippins R.B. Kestler D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our data show that A6 oligonucleotide has a rather weak ability to inhibit the CNP activity, with a K i of ∼0.8 mm. One possible explanation for the previous result is the presence of RNase activity in the CNP-CF preparation, which would produce mononucleotides from added RNA and so inhibit CNP activity. Based on our results, we conclude that single-stranded RNA does not produce any specific interactions with CNP-CF above those identified for mononucleotides. The possibility that CNP binds double-stranded RNA is currently under study. Compared with the C terminus, little is known about the function of the N-terminal half of CNP. Sequence analysis revealed similarity to numerous proteins containing P-loop ATPase domains. This led to the suggestion that CNP may be a polynucleotide kinase (38Koonin E.V. Gorbalenya A.E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although experimental evidence for this has been unsuccessfully sought. 2P. E. Braun and D. Lasco, unpublished data. Comparison of CNP with RICH shows divergence at the N terminus, suggesting the existence of shared (C-terminal) and divergent (N-terminal) functions. Structure determination of the N-terminal domain and/or full-length CNP may help to define the global role of CNP in oligodendrocytes, where it is most abundant. Given that other members of this protein superfamily are involved in RNA-processing pathways, could RNA be a physiological substrate for CNP? The structural features of the catalytic domain such as the RNA recognition motif-like fold of each lobe, the abundance of positively charged and aromatic residues on the β-sheet surface, and the large curvature of the binding cavity are consistent with this hypothesis. Although our data demonstrate that single-stranded oligo(A) possesses weak, millimolar affinity for the CNP catalytic domain, we cannot rule out 1) that CNP might bind only to double-stranded nucleic acids or to a specific RNA sequence, 2) that a 3′- or 5′-terminal phosphate might be important for binding, or 3) that the N-terminal portion of CNP may regulate binding or affect binding activity. In considering the possible cellular functions of CNP, it is important to take into account other information such as the cellular localization of this enzyme. Both CNP isoforms are membrane-associated via isoprenylation at their C termini (21De Angelis D.A. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 386-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The larger isoform of CNP, CNP2, contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus (27McFerran B. Burgoyne R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2979-2985PubMed Google Scholar). CNP is also known to interact with tubulin (26Bifulco M. Laezza C. Stingo S. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1807-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), leading to the speculation that CNP might have a role in mRNA transport as observed in oligodendrocytes (40Carson J.H. Kwon S.

Proteins such as myelin basic protein and carbonic anhydrase (43Ghandour M.S. Skoff R.P. Glia. 1991; 4: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Tansey F.A. Zhang H. Cammer W. Neurochem.

In addition, there are signaling molecules such as nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate and cADP-ribose (reviewed in Ref. 46Chini E.N. De Toledo F.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1191-C1198Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) upon which CNP might potentially act. Future structural and enzyme studies of CNP will hopefully clarify the cellular function of this highly conserved yet enigmatic protein.

Disintegrins represent a group of cysteine-rich peptides released in Crotalidae and Viperidae snake venoms by proteolytic processing of PII metalloproteinases (1Kini R.M. Evans H.J. Toxicon. 1992; 30: 265-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Disintegrins are potent inhibitors of the binding of β1 and β3 integrins to their ligands. Biochemical (2Dennis Carter P.

Protein Res. 1996; 48: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have disclosed that the inhibitory activity of disintegrins is linked to a tripeptide motif, which mimics the recognition sequence of the integrin ligands. The tripeptide is maintained in the active conformation at the apex of a mobile loop by the appropriate pairing of cysteine residues (8Calvete J.J. Schäfer W Soszka T. Lu W.Q. Cook J.J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Disintegrins are divided into five different groups (10Calvete J.J. Moreno-Murciano M.P. Theakston R.D.G. Kisiel D.G. Marcinkiewicz C. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The first group includes short disintegrins composed of 49–51 residues and four disulfide bonds. The second group is formed by medium sized disintegrins, which contain about 70 amino acids and six disulfide bonds. The third group includes long disintegrins composed of 84 residues cross-linked by seven disulfide bonds. The disintegrin domains of PIII snake venom metalloproteases contain about 100 amino acids with 16 cysteine residues involved in the formation of eight disulfide bonds. These constitute the fourth group of the disintegrin family. Unlike the short, medium, and long disintegrins, which are single-chain molecules, the fifth group is composed of homo- and heterodimers. Dimeric disintegrins contain subunits of about 67 residues with 10 cysteines involved in the formation of four intrachain disulfide bonds and two interchain cysteine linkages. Current biochemical and genetic data support the view that structural diversification among the disintegrin family occurred through disulfide bond engineering (10Calvete J.J. Moreno-Murciano M.P. Theakston R.D.G. Kisiel D.G. Marcinkiewicz C. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The integrin-binding loop represents a mutational “hot spot.” Unlike the monomeric disintegrins, which most frequently contain the RGD sequence, the dimeric disintegrins exhibit a large sequence diversity in their integrin-binding motifs. The inhibitory activity of disintegrin EC3 from Echis carinatus toward the α4β1 and α4β7 integrins is associated with the MLD sequence of its B-subunit (11Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Raida M. Vijay-Kumar S. Huang Z. Lobb R.R. Niewiarowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12468-12473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); the selective recognition of integrin α5β1 by EMF-10, from the venom of Eristocophis macmahoni, is associated with the MGD(W) motif (12Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz M.M. Raida M. Schick P. Lobb R.R. Niewiarowski S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13302-13309Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); and the presence of a WGD motif in CC8, a heterodimeric disintegrin from Cerastes cerastes cerastes, enhances its inhibitory effect on αIIbβ3, αvβ3, and α5β1 integrins (13Calvete J.J. Fox J.W. Agelan A. Niewiarowski S. Marcinkiewicz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2014-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A conserved characteristic among disintegrins is the presence of an acidic residue in the C-terminal part of the integrin-binding motif. The crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin αvβ3 in complex with an RGD ligand (14Xiong J-P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) shows that the peptide fits into a crevice between the αV propeller and the β3 A-domain. The arginine side chain is held in place by interactions with αV carboxylates 218 and 150, whereas the glycine residue makes several hydrophobic interactions with αV, and the aspartate of the ligand interacts primarily with residues in the β3 A-domain. Thus, the conserved aspartate residue appears to be responsible for the binding of disintegrins to the integrin receptors that share a β-subunit, whereas the two other residues of the integrin-binding motif (RG, MG, WG, ML, VG) dictate the integrin specificity. Obtustatin, a short disintegrin isolated from the venom of Vipera lebetina obtusa (15Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Calvete J.J. Celda B. Marcinkiewicz C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) exhibits unique structural and functional features. With only 41 residues, obtustatin represents the smallest disintegrin reported to date. It contains an integrin recognition loop that is two residues shorter than that of the other disintegrins and whose amino acid sequence (20WKTSLTSHY28) strongly departs from the primary structure of the loops of all known disintegrins. The KTS sequence within this novel integrin-binding loop endows obtustatin with selective inhibitory activity of the in vitro adhesion of integrin α1β1 to collagen IV (15Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Calvete J.J. Celda B. Marcinkiewicz C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Obtustatin is also a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis in vivo in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, and it impairs the development of Lewis lung tumor in the mouse (16Marcinkiewicz C. Weinreb P.H. Calvete J.J. Kisiel D.G. Mousa S.A. Tuszynski G.P. Lobb R.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 2020-2023PubMed Google Scholar) by about 50%. Hence, obtustatin represents a potential lead molecule for the design of inhibitors of angiogenesis in cancer therapy. An in depth understanding of the structure-function correlation of obtustatin requires a detailed analysis of its structure and dynamics. We have recently determined the solution structure of obtustatin (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by NMR spectroscopy. The obtustatin structure revealed that the KTS motif is oriented toward a side of the active loop instead of being located at the apex of a β-hairpin as in the known RGD-containing disintegrin structures. Moreover, doubling of the NMR signals in the aromatic region of residues Trp20, His27, and Tyr28, which are located at the base of the integrin-binding loop, indicated that the side chains of these residues exist in alternate conformations and undergo a slow exchange process in the millisecond time scale. The aim of this study was to analyze the dynamics of the backbone and side chain atoms of obtustatin in detail. The major conclusions from our results are that the integrin binding loop and the C-terminal tail of obtustatin display concerted motions in the 100–300-ps time scale and that the active site residue threonine 22 is important for maintaining the conformation of the active loop. In the loop size, composition, and flexibility, along with the distinct orientation of the KTS tripeptide, may underlie the structural basis of obtustatin's unique selectivity and specificity for integrin α1β1. Sample Preparation—Obtustatin was purified from the venom of V. lebetina obtusa (Latoxan, France) as described (15Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Calvete J.J. Celda B. Marcinkiewicz C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (using an Applied Biosystems DE-Pro spectrometer and α-hydroxycinammic acid saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile as matrix). The isotope-averaged molecular mass (M + H+) of native obtustatin was 4394.2 Da, which accurately matches the calculated mass from its amino acid sequence (SwissProt accession number P83469). Obtustatin was dissolved at a final protein concentration of ∼2.5 mm in a mixture of 10% D2O and 90% H2O in a 5 mm Wilmad NMR tube, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.0 with HCl. Off-resonance ROESY—Internal motions were analyzed using the off-resonance ROESY method described by Schleucher and Wijmenga (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, cross-peak build-up rates in NOESY 1The abbreviations used are: NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; ROE, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect; ROESY, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s., root mean square. and ROESY spectra can be described as follows, σNOE=120hμ0γ24π2f(r)(6J(2ω)-J(0))(Eq. 1) σROE=120hμ0γ24π2f(r)(2J(0)+3J(ω))(Eq. 2) where f(r) is a distance-dependent term that depends on the average internuclear distance and on distance fluctuations (radial component of internal motions). J(ω) is the spectral density, which depends only on the angular component of internal motions (19Neuhaus D. Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1989Google Scholar). Thus, the radial component can be eliminated when the ratio of NOE and ROE rates is considered (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). R=σNOEσROE=6J(2ω)-J(0)2J(0)+3J(ω)(Eq. 3) In a ROESY experiment, the angle θi at which a spin i with a chemical shift Ωi will be locked by a spin lock of field strength γB1 and an offset Δ is defined as follows. θi=arctan(γB1/(Ωi-Δ))(Eq. 4) Unmodified NOESY and ROESY spectra can be associated with values of the θ angle equal to 0 and 90°, respectively. Therefore, the angle at which the NOE and ROE effect contributions are equal, and thus the spectral signal is cancelled provides a measure of the ratio R, 0=σeff(θ0)=c(θi,θj)(σNOEcos2θ0+σROEsin2θ0)(Eq. 5) where c(θi, θj) is a scaling factor that does not affect the zero-crossing angle (θ0) value (19Neuhaus D. Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1989Google Scholar). R can be determined measuring the value of θ, where NOE and ROE contributions cancel, and its value relates to angular internal motions. R=σNOEσROE=-tan2θ0(Eq. 6) Since the spectral density J(ω) depends only on the angular component of internal motions (Equation 3), low and high values of θ0 are inversely proportional to the degree of angular flexibility of a given vector. Variations on θ0 values are largest for motions in the time scale of 100–300 ps; therefore, these motions are the main contributors to the internal dynamics detected here. In this time scale, θ0 seems to have a parallel behavior to the maximum of the S 2 Lipari-Szabo order parameter for that range of τe values (100–300 ps). Thus, θ0, provides an estimation of the relative angular flexibility for a given NOE vector in a similar fashion to that extracted from relative differences in S 2 in traditional heteronuclear relaxation studies for the 15N–1H or 13C–1H bond vector. NMR Data Acquisition and Analysis—All two-dimensional spectra were recorded on Bruker AVANCE spectrometers working at proton frequencies of 500, 600, and 700 MHz. Triple resonance cryogenic NMR probes were used for the measurements at 500 and 600 MHz, and a conventional triple resonance probe was used for the 700-MHz experiments. All spectra were processed with XWIN-NMR version 3.1 and analyzed with SPARKY (20Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco1999Google Scholar) software packages on a Pentium 4 work station running the Linux operating system. An independent set of off-resonance ROESY spectra was recorded on each spectrometer at 25 °C. The off-resonance pulse sequence for off-resonance experiments was obtained from Ref. 18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and adapted to our spectrometers. In general, experimental parameters were as similar as possible to those reported previously for BPTI (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem.

All ROESY experiments had a mixing time of 100 ms, spectral width of 10 ppm, and transmitter offset at the water position equivalent to 4.69 ppm at 25 °C. For each experiment, 512 t 1 and 2048 t 2 complex data points were acquired. The number of scans was 24 for all experiments. A regular on-resonance ROESY was recorded at each spectrometer with the same parameters as for the off-resonance ROESY experiments for detection of positive cross-peaks indicating chemical exchange processes. Values for γB1 were 7180, 9259, and 10,000 Hz for the 500-, 600-, and 700-MHz experiments, respectively, corresponding to ∼50% of the used spectral width, as recommended in the literature. Table I shows values of frequency offsets and equivalent θ at the transmitter frequency (middle of the spectrum) used in all off-resonance ROESY experiments for evaluation the optimum range of offset frequencies (19Neuhaus D. Williamson M. The Nuclear Overhauser Effect in Structural and Conformational Analysis. VCH Publishers, New York1989Google Scholar). ROESY cross-peaks were assigned using obtustatin resonances from the BioMagResBank (BMRB entry 5410). Cross-peaks were fitted to Lorentzian curve peak shapes and integrated using SPARKY internal commands. ROESY cross-peaks showing severe overlapping were disregarded for further analysis. Graphical representation, second-order polynomial fitting, and zero-crossing identification for cross-peak intensity versus θ dependence were carried out using homemade gnuplot macros and Unix shell scripts. In general, θ value at the zero-crossing point did not significantly depart from values obtained by analysis of peak volumes or data heights.Table IExperimental parameters used for recording off-resonance ROESY spectra at 500-, 600-, and 700-MHz proton frequencies500 MHz600 MHz700 MHzOffsetθcaθc is the value of θ for the frequency at the middle of the spectrumOffsetθcaθc is the value of θ for the frequency at the middle of the spectrumOffsetθcaθc is the value of θ for the frequency at the middle of the spectrumHzdegreesHzdegreesHzdegrees21,00021.022,20025.525,00024.718,00024.620,00028.022,00028.116,00027.718,20031.020,00030.915,00029.616,50034.019,00032.513,00034.015,00037.017,00036.111,00039.914,20039.115,00040.510,00043.113,10042.012,00045.011,10048.2a θc is the value of θ for the frequency at the middle of the spectrum Open table in a new tab Hydrodynamic Calculations—For comparison with experimental data and for initial estimation of global correlation time τm, HydroNMR version 5.a software (21Bernado P. Garcia de la Torre J. Pons M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was employed with the obtustatin NMR structure retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB code 1MPZ). The disulfide bond network of obtustatin, along with the r.m.s. deviation value of 1.1 Å for all residues among the 20 NMR conformers (0.6 Å for the 29 best-defined residues) (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), provide the level of overall structure globularity and rigidity required for this type of analysis. Temperature and solvent viscosity for calculations were set to 25 °C and 0.010 poise, respectively, as recommended in the software manual. Theoretical rigid limit values of θ0 for each set of off-resonance ROESY experiments were estimated using the calculated value of τm. NMR relaxation methods for studying protein dynamics rely on the determination of internal motions of the vector formed by a particular bond, typically N–H or C–H (22Kay L.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 23Fischer M.W.F. Majumdar A. Zuiderweg E.R.P. Prog.

NMR. 2001; 38: 197-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A major drawback of this approach is that the samples need to be isotope-labeled. In addition, only very local motions, which may indirectly indicate the existence of nonlocal flexibility, are determined. Recently, new methods for the detection of internal motions by homonuclear NMR have been developed (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Malliavin T.E. Desvaux H. Aumelas A. Chavanieu A. Delsuc M.A. J. Magn.

Liu H. Schelich T. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 128: 70-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These exploit the fact that the NOESY and ROESY cross-peak intensities depend on both the internuclear distances and internal motion (28LeMaster D.M. Kay L.E. Brunger A.T. Prestegard J.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Brüschweiler R. Roux B. Blackledge M. Griesinger C. Karplus M. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 2289-2302Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Moreover, intraresidue and sequential NOESY Hα-HN cross-peak intensities are directly related to the dihedral angles ϕ and Ψ, respectively. Thus, the backbone flexibility information is more accurate and can be directly extracted from the experimental data. A method to separate and analyze the contribution of the internal motions to the off-resonance ROESY spectra has been reported (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The ratio between NOE and ROE signal intensities is related to internal motions. Off-resonance ROESY experiments measure a weighted average of NOE and ROE. The NOE to ROE ratios are obtained from a series of off-resonance ROESY spectra, and a parameter θ0, describing internal angular motions in a time scale of 100–300 ps, is calculated. We have applied this approach to obtustatin in order to characterize its internal motions. Our aim is, in particular, to validate the proposed hinge mechanism of the integrin recognition loop (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and to determine the dynamics of the KTS integrin-binding motif and the C-terminal tail. NMR Experimental Data—Of the 37 nonproline amino acids of obtustatin, NMR off-resonance ROESY data have been analyzed for 33 intraresidue and 35 sequential resolved Hα-HN cross-peaks from spectra recorded at 500, 600, and 700 MHz (see Fig. 2). The remaining intraresidue and sequential Hα-HN cross-peaks were not taken into consideration due to spectral overlap, resonance broadening, or the absence of the corresponding NOE interaction. All analyzed cross-peaks corresponded to negative intensities (opposite to diagonal sign) in a regular ROESY spectrum, indicating the absence of chemical exchange in the millisecond time scale. In addition, nine intraresidue or sequential cross-peaks involving at least one side-chain proton of the α1β1 integrin recognition motif residues Lys21, Thr22, and Ser23 and five other side-chain cross-peaks into the hinge residues Trp20, His27, and Tyr28, were analyzed. For establishing relative differences of θ0 values of well and ill defined residues in the NMR solution structure of obtustatin (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), six Hβ-HN intraresidue cross-peaks involving methylene or methyl atoms in the well defined amino acids Thr3, Arg8, Gln9, Leu12, Ala15, and Thr18 were included in the study. Cysteine Hβ atoms were excluded from the selection because of possible underestimation of the dispersion of atomic coordinates due to disulfide bond restraints. Hβ-Hβ cross-peaks for cysteines forming the disulfide bridges Cys1–Cys10 and Cys19–Cys36, which had been unambiguously assigned in NOESY spectra at 100 ms (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were taken into consideration. However, the Hβ-Hβ resonances of Cys7, Cys34, Cys6, and Cys29 were excluded due to overlapping NOE cross-peaks. Internal Motions and θ0 Values—The intensity of all analyzed cross-peaks was fitted to a second order polynomial function of the θ value at the three different magnetic fields. Fig. 1 illustrates the polynomial fitting for intraresidue and sequential Hα-HN NOE cross-peaks of alanine 15. θ0 values were calculated for each magnetic field and normalized with respect to the corresponding theoretical rigid limit. Although θ0 values for intra-Hα-HN NOE cross-peaks were expected to be larger than the equivalent sequential θ0 values, because the accessible energy regions in the Ramachandran plot are wider for Ψ than for ϕ dihedral angle, both situations, intraresidue larger than sequential and sequential larger than intraresidue, were observed. This indicates that the internal motions are not preferentially associated with any component of the dihedral angle. In Fig. 2, the values of θ0 at the three magnetic fields for all measured backbone ROESY cross-peaks have been plotted against the amino acid sequence. The reliability of any θ0 value has been scored by the r.m.s. deviation of the corresponding polynomial fitting. θ0 values of all of the backbone cross-peaks extracted from the spectra at 500 and 600 MHz showed an r.m.s. deviation below 10%. The r.m.s. deviations of equivalent cross-peaks in the 700-MHz spectra were slightly larger because the signal to noise ratios in the 500- and 600-MHz spectra were better than those at 700 MHz. This is due to the sensitivity enhancement effect of the cryoprobes. These results are also in line with previous off-resonance ROESY experiments, which indicate best results for small molecules at low magnetic fields (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Malliavin T.E. Desvaux H. Aumelas A. Chavanieu A. Delsuc M.A. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 140: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In general, side-chain cross-peaks showed larger r.m.s. deviation values than the intraresidue cross-peaks. The likely reason for this is the additional contributions to the ROE/NOE intensities due to other motions, such as the contribution of the methyl and methylene rotation. Furthermore, spin diffusion or chemical exchange may contribute to the measured cross-peak intensity and degrade the accuracy of the θ0 measurements. In order to evaluate the absolute degree of flexibility and to normalize the data obtained at different magnetic fields, a value for the θ0 at the theoretical limit (ωτc >> 1) was calculated from the graphical representation of S 2 with respect to τe. The global correlation time, τm, of 2.8 ns obtained from a hydrodynamic calculation was used for the evaluation of the θ0 at the rigid limit. The estimated values for the theoretical rigid limits of θ0 at 500, 600, and 700 MHz were 31.6, 32.7, and 33.4°, respectively. However, many residues showed θ0 values larger than this rigid limit. Such a behavior has been related to the deviations of the true θ0 values due to the finite duration of gradients and adiabatic ramps during the mixing time (18Schleucher J. Wijmenga S.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5881-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The absence of secondary structure in obtustatin (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) may also lead to overestimation of τm in the hydrodynamic calculation, affecting thereby the values of the theoretical rigid limits of θ0. Nevertheless, this nonideal behavior did not preclude the use of the θ0 rigid limit at each magnetic field for normalization and comparison of the absolute θ0 values. On the other hand, differences in normalized θ0 values show better agreement with respect to differences in theoretical S 2 order parameters calculated in model situations (data not shown). Hence, the individual values of θ0 at the different magnetic fields were normalized with respect to the corresponding rigid limit values, and a mean-normalized value of θ0 was determined. Values of θ0 of ROE cross-peaks for side chains of selected well defined residues in the NMR conformers, residues at the hinge region, and residues at the recognition site are shown in Table II. Although the highest flexibility was expected to be associated with residues Lys21–Ser26 and Leu38–Gly41, which exhibit the largest r.m.s. deviation in the NMR solution conformers of obtustatin (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, bottom panel), the lowest values of mean-normalized backbone θ0 were associated with residues Cys19, Trp20, His27, Tyr28, Leu38, and Gly41 (Fig. 3, upper panel). We interpret this result on the basis of a hinge motion at the basis of the loop. Thus, bundle superpositions using residues with the lowest r.m.s. deviation or highest dihedral order parameter values may produce this distortion in proteins which exhibit relative mobility between different structural regions.Table IIMean-normalized θ0 values (averaged for data at 500, 600, and 700 MHz) for cross-peaks involving side chains of well defined residues (w), amino acids of the integrin recognition site (r), hinge residues (h), and residues within the integrin-binding loop (l)NOE cross-peakNormalized mean θ0Thr3 HN-Hβ (w)0.85 ± 0.05Arg8 HN-Hβ (w)0.83 ± 0.04Gln9 HN-Hβ (w)0.78 ± 0.03Leu12 HN-Hβ (w)0.74 ± 0.07Ala15 HN-Hβ (w)0.67 ± 0.10Thr18 HN-Hβ (w)0.81 ± 0.04Trp20 HN-K21 Hβ (r)0.73 ± 0.08Lys21 Hα-Hβ (r)0.81 ± 0.05Lys21 Hα-Thr22 Hγ2 (r)0.80 ± 0.06Thr22 Hα-Hγ2 (r)0.82 ± 0.04Thr22 Hα-Ser23 Hβ (r)0.55 ± 0.12Thr22 HN-Lys21 Hγ (r)0.69 ± 0.08Lys21 Hδ-Ser23 Hβ (r)0.50 ± 0.11Ser23 Hα-Hβ (r)0.76 ± 0.07Leu24 HN-Ser23 Hβ (r)0.71 ± 0.09Trp20 HN-Hβ (h)0.71 ± 0.09His27 HN-Hβ (h)0.83 ± 0.11Tyr28 HN-Hβ (h)0.66 ± 0.09Tyr28 Hβ-Cys29 HN (h)0.81 ± 0.13Lys21 Hα-Trp20 Hβ (h)0.62 ± 0.12Thr25 Hβ-HN (l)0.71 ± 0.09Ser26 Hβ-HN (l)0.78 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab Integrin-binding Loop Flexibility and Proposed Hinge Motions—Obtustatin shows several flexible regions along the whole amino acid sequence. Fig. 4 depicts the information inferred from the θ0 values for intraresidue and sequential Hα-HN NOE cross-peaks mapped on the mean NMR structure using the “sausage” representation (30Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar). In general, as expected, increased flexibility is associated with solvent-exposed residues calculated by PROCHECK (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) like Thr3, Gly4, Arg8, Cys19, Trp20, Lys32, and Ser33 (Fig. 3). Residues Cys6, Cys7, Cys10, Ala15, Gly16, and Cys34, which are part of the core of the protein cross-linked by disulfide bonds, display values of mean-normalized θ0 close to or above 1 (Fig. 3), which correspond to the rigid limit. With the exception of the integrin recognition loop residues, the data show good agreement between regions with high NMR structural dispersion and increased flexibility. The integrin-binding loop shows larger dispersion in the NMR structures than that expected from the flexibility estimations. This further supports the hypothesis of an overall movement of this loop (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Superposition of the ensemble of solution structures of obtustatin (PDB code 1MPZ) shows that the local motions of the integrin binding loop are mainly lateral within a range of ∼35° and with maximal displacement of about 5 Å. In comparison, the orientational flexibility of the integrin binding loop of echistatin has been reported to occur within a range of 60–70° (32Chen Y. Suri A.K. Kominos D. Sanyal G. Naytor A.M. Pitzenberger S.M. Garsky V.M. Levy R.M. Baum J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 307-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, residues Trp20, His27, and Tyr28 showed increased backbone flexibility, arguing in favor of the proposal that these residues act as a hinge for the movement of the integrin recognition loop. On the other hand, the increased flexibility of residues Cys36 and Leu38, along with a value of θ0 at 700 MHz of 23° for sequential P37 Hα-Leu38 Hβ NOE cross-peak, suggests that these residues are acting as an additional hinge for the overall motion of the C-terminal tail. In the solution structure of obtustatin, this portion of the molecule runs parallel to the integrin-binding loop and interacts with it through a NOE between Lys21 Hβ and Tyr39 HN (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). From this evidence, we interpret that the C-terminal tail and the integrin-binding loop display a concerted movement articulated at residues Trp20, His27, Tyr28, Cys36, and Leu38. It has been shown that the C-terminal tail of another short disintegrin, echistatin, is involved in modulating the binding affinity of the disintegrin toward integrin αIIbβ3 (33Marcinkiewicz C. Vijay-Kumar S. McLane M.A. Niewiarowski S. Blood. 1997; 90: 1565-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, an echistatin C-terminal peptide inhibited echistatin-integrin αIIbβ3 binding, activated the integrin to bind immobilized ligands, and increased fibrinogen binding to peptide-treated platelets (34Wright P.S. Saudek V. Owen T.J. Harbeson S.L. Bitonti A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The NMR solution structures of the RGD-containing disintegrins echistatin (5Saudek V. Atkinson R.A. Pelton J.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7369-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), kistrin (4Adler M. Lazarus R.A. Dennis M.S. Wagner G. Science. 1991; 253: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), flavoridin (6Senn H. Klaus W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 907-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and albolabrin (7Smith K.J. Jaseja M. Lu X. Williams J.A. Hyde E.I. Trayer I.P. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1996; 48: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that, similar to obtustatin, their C-terminal portions are in close spatial proximity to the RGD loop. Senn and Klaus (6Senn H. Klaus W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 907-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) have reported that the C-terminal residues of flavoridin (Cys64–Trp67) are connected to the RGD loop. The authors suggested that the C terminus of the disintegrin could act as a secondary integrin-binding determinant. Dynamics of the Integrin α1β1 Recognition Motif—Analysis of the flexibility show that over the time scale measured, the main-chain atoms of the 21KTS23 motif have well defined conformations (Fig. 3, upper panel). Thus, the large r.m.s. deviation values associated with these residues when the best 50 NMR conformers of obtustatin were superimposed over the backbone of well defined residues of the protein core (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lower panel) can be ascribed to the global movement of the integrin-binding loop rather than to increased flexibility of the KTS motif. This situation is similar to that reported for echistatin (35Brockel C. Cowley D.J. Pelton J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1122: 196-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Local order at the RGD adhesion site of kistrin has also been reported (36Adler M. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In obtustatin, ROE cross-peaks for Hβ proton indicate that, among the integrin recognition residues, the central threonine residue displays the lowest flexibility, whereas Ser23 has the most flexible amino acid side chain (Table II). Values of θ0 for the analyzed network of NOEs involving the three residues at the active site and adjacent loop residues are depicted on the NMR mean structure in Fig. 5. Threonine 22 has been mapped as the most critical residue for blocking the α1β1-integrin collagen IV interaction (15Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Calvete J.J. Celda B. Marcinkiewicz C. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 366-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Noteworthy, hydrogen bonding is observed between Hγ2 of Thr22 and residues Thr25 and Ser26 in around 50% of the minimal energy NMR structures (17Moreno-Murciano M.P. Monleón D. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Celda B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), indicating that the side chain of Thr22 is oriented toward the center of the integrin specificity loop. Values of normalized θ0 for Hβ-HN of Thr25 and Ser26 of 0.71 ± 0.09 and 0.78 ± 0.08 respectively (Table II), which are fairly high for methyl and methylene groups, support the conformation of Thr22 proposed from the solution structure. Unfortunately, NOEs between Thr22 and Thr25 or Ser26 are strongly overlapped, and the θ0 calculations were not reliable. We argue that hydrogen bonding together with solvent protection is responsible for the reduced flexibility observed for Thr22. Moreover, the hydrogen bond network between Thr22, Thr25, and/or Ser26 may determine the active conformation of the integrin-binding loop of obtustatin. The size and shape of this loop has been proven to be a determinant for conferring integrin specificity to cyclic RGD peptides with a known conformation (3Pfaff M. Tangemann K. Müller B. Gurrath M. Müller G. Kessler H. Timpl R. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20233-20238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the short sized, obtustatin-related disintegrins echistatin and eristostatin (9McLane M.A. Vijay-Kumar S. Marcinkiewicz C. Calvete J.J. Niewiarowski S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the critical importance of Thr22 may be linked with a structuring mechanism of the integrin-binding loop for proper recognition of the α1β1 integrin rather than with a direct role in receptor binding. Conclusion—The two major findings from our homonuclear NMR study of the backbone and active site dynamics of obtustatin are that threonine 22 is important for maintaining the conformation of the active loop and that the integrin binding loop and the C-terminal tail display a concerted movement, which we propose is due to a hinge effect articulated at residues Trp20, His27, Tyr28, Cys36, and Leu38. Fast recognition and fitting processes are typically brought about by mobile segments in protein structures (37Burgen A.S.V. Roberts G.C.K. Freeney J. Nature. 1975; 253: 753-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Williams R.J.P Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 183: 479-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the conformation and dynamics of the integrin binding loop, along with the flexibility and internal motions of the side chains of active site residues 21KTS23 of obtustatin are probably important for fast recognition of integrin α1β1. On the other hand, the composition and architecture of the integrin recognition loop, maintained in its active conformation by a network of hydrogen bonds between Thr22 and other loop residues, may determine the selective inhibition of the α1β1 integrin receptor by obtustatin. In this sense, if the binding mechanism of obtustatin is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the extracellular segment of integrin αvβ3 in complex with a RGD ligand, the residues Lys21 and Ser23 represent the functional homologues of the arginine and aspartic acid residues, respectively. We are currently investigating the hypothesis that Lys21 confers α1 recognition specificity and Ser23 is a major determinant of the binding affinity for the β1 subunit. We thank the Servico Central de Soporte a la Investigación Experimental of the University of Valencia for providing access to the NMR facility and high performance computing facilities."

https://openalex.org/W2074760018,"The cell cycle-regulated B-Myb transcription factor is required for early embryonic development and is implicated in regulating cell growth and differentiation. In addition to its transcriptional regulatory properties, recent data indicate that B-Myb can release active cyclin/Cdk2 activity from the retinoblastoma-related p107 protein by directly interacting with the p107 N terminus. As this p107 domain has homology to the cyclin-binding domains of the p21Waf1/Cip1 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), we investigated in this study whether B-Myb could also interact with these CKIs. No in vivo interaction was found with either p21Waf1/Cip1 or p27 KIP1 , however, binding to p57 KIP2 was readily detectable in both in vivo and in vitro assays. The B-Myb-interacting region of p57 KIP2 mapped to the cyclin-binding domain. Consistent with this, B-Myb competed with cyclin A2 for binding to p57 KIP2 , resulting in release of active cyclin/Cdk2 kinase. Moreover, B-Myb partially overcame the ability of p57 KIP2 to induce G1 arrest in Saos-2 cells. Despite similarities with previous p107 studies, the B-Myb domains required for interaction with p57 KIP2 were quite different from those implicated for p107. Thus, it is evident that B-Myb may promote cell proliferation by a non-transcriptional mechanism that involves release of active cyclin/Cdk2 from p57 KIP2 as well as p107. The cell cycle-regulated B-Myb transcription factor is required for early embryonic development and is implicated in regulating cell growth and differentiation. In addition to its transcriptional regulatory properties, recent data indicate that B-Myb can release active cyclin/Cdk2 activity from the retinoblastoma-related p107 protein by directly interacting with the p107 N terminus. As this p107 domain has homology to the cyclin-binding domains of the p21Waf1/Cip1 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), we investigated in this study whether B-Myb could also interact with these CKIs. No in vivo interaction was found with either p21Waf1/Cip1 or p27 KIP1 , however, binding to p57 KIP2 was readily detectable in both in vivo and in vitro assays. The B-Myb-interacting region of p57 KIP2 mapped to the cyclin-binding domain. Consistent with this, B-Myb competed with cyclin A2 for binding to p57 KIP2 , resulting in release of active cyclin/Cdk2 kinase. Moreover, B-Myb partially overcame the ability of p57 KIP2 to induce G1 arrest in Saos-2 cells. Despite similarities with previous p107 studies, the B-Myb domains required for interaction with p57 KIP2 were quite different from those implicated for p107. Thus, it is evident that B-Myb may promote cell proliferation by a non-transcriptional mechanism that involves release of active cyclin/Cdk2 from p57 KIP2 as well as p107. The vertebrate Myb transcription factors comprise a small family of regulatory proteins with critical roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. The prototype of this family, c-Myb is required for hematopoietic cell development (1Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pyetryga D.W. Scott W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar), whereas A-Myb is necessary for spermatogenesis and breast development (2Toscani A. Mettus R. Coupland R. Simpkins H. Litvin J. Orth J. Hetton K. Reddy E. Nature. 1997; 386: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In contrast to c-Myb and A-Myb, which are expressed in restricted tissue lineages, B-Myb is expressed throughout embryonic development and in all tissue lineages (3Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this expression pattern, B-myb gene knockout mice die at a very early stage of development (E4.5–E6.5) with an apparent deficiency in growth of the inner cell mass (4Tanaka Y. Patestos N.P. Maekawa T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28067-28070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although transcription of B-myb is ubiquitous with respect to cell lineage, expression is strictly regulated during the cell cycle. Transcription is efficiently repressed in non-proliferating cells arrested in G0 through a promoter E2F binding site (5Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Upon re-entry of quiescent cells into cycle, maximal levels of B-Myb are produced in S phase (6Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this level of control, the B-Myb protein undergoes a post-translational modification specifically during S phase resulting from phosphorylation by the cyclin A2/Cdk2 protein kinase (6Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar, 7Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J.

Significantly, cyclin A2 kinase activity appears to counteract the inhibitory effect of the NRD and results in markedly enhanced B-Myb transactivation activity (7Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I.

Current evidence indicates that transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms combine to direct high levels of hyperactivated B-Myb protein to S phase, strongly suggesting that B-Myb plays a critical role at this stage of the cell cycle. Consistent with this notion, B-myb antisense oligonucleotides inhibit proliferation of certain myeloid, lymphoid, glioblastoma, fibroblast, and neuroblastoma cell lines (14Arsura M. Introna M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas, conversely, constitutive expression of B-myb prevents cell cycle arrest in serum-deprived BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts (15Sala A. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10415-10419Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and interleukin-6-induced M1 myeloid leukemia cells (18Bies J. Hoffman B. Amanullah A. Giese T. Wolff L. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 355-363PubMed Google Scholar). Altogether, these studies indicate an essential role for B-Myb in cell growth, and it is therefore of interest to determine precisely what functions B-Myb provides and at what stage of the cell cycle these are required Deployment of a dominant interfering Myb protein, engineered to competitively inhibit transactivation at Myb-regulated promoters, provided evidence that the transcriptional regulatory activity of B-Myb contributes to G1/S transition in embryonal stem (ES) cells (19Iwai N. Kitajima K. Sakai K. Kimura T. Nakano T. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is surprisingly little indication to date of the identity of critical target genes that could account for this requirement. Thus, recent microarray screens identified a panel of potential B-Myb-regulated genes (20Rushton J.J. Davis L.M. Lei W. Mo X. Leutz A. Ness S.A. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), however, it is not immediately apparent how their products could impinge upon cell cycle regulation. Other studies suggest that B-Myb influences cell proliferation by interacting with cell cycle regulatory proteins in a manner that is independent of the transcriptional activity of B-Myb. Thus, ectopic expression of B-myb can promote transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle in cells in which a G1 checkpoint has been activated by p53 or p107 (16Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Notably, a transcriptionally inactive B-Myb mutant (MUT-7) was partially active in overcoming p53-induced growth arrest in Saos-2 cells (16Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), moreover, using an extensive panel of B-Myb mutants, we recently found that the ability of B-Myb to overcome p107-induced G1 arrest was dependent upon a direct physical interaction between these proteins but did not correlate with transactivation function (22Bessa M. Joaquin M. Tavner F. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). B-Myb binds to an N-terminal region of p107 that contains a cyclin-binding motif required for interaction with, and inhibition of, cyclin A2/Cdk2 and cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activities (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that B-Myb binding could occlude the p107 cyclin binding motif and thereby block p107 from acting as a Cdk inhibitor (CKI). Consistent with this notion, we found that co-expression of B-Myb rescued cyclin E/Cdk2 activity in cells ectopically expressing p107 (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), although a similar activity could not be demonstrated for cyclin A2/Cdk2. Mutation or deletion of the p107 cyclin binding motif (VACRKSV: amino acids 65–71) drastically reduced binding to B-Myb, suggesting that this motif is directly involved in B-Myb recognition. Notably, the p21 WAF1 , p27 KIP1 , and p57 KIP2 CKIs contain related cyclin-binding motifs in which the central ACR core is conserved (24Castano E. Kleyner Y. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5380-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether B-Myb was able to interact with these other CKIs and by so doing release active Cdk activity. Plasmids—The pCMVp21, pCMVp27, and pcDNA3.9E10p57 plasmids were obtained from Dr. Xin Lu. The pT81luc 3xA, pCMVβgal, pCMVcycA2, and pCMVcdk2 plasmids were described previously (8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Expression vectors (pCMX) encoding Myc-epitope-tagged cyclin A2 and cyclin E were obtained from Dr. Jonathon Pines. The pcDNA3 expression vector encoding a Myc-epitope-tagged RB C792–928 fragment was obtained from Dr. Sybille Mittnacht. The expression vector encoding p107HA was obtained from Dr. Liang Zhu. Wild type pcDNA3/B-myb and the mutants +675, +590, +561, +491, +444, +422, +394, Δ205–243, Δ244–288, and Δ310–332 were described previously (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J.

The +348 mutant was derived by subcloning a HindIII/EcoRI fragment from pSVB-myb. Aat (8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3. The p57 mutants P1, P2, and P3 were generated by Herculase Hot Start-mediated PCR (Stratagene) using pcDNA3.9E10p57 as a template with a common reverse primer (ACGAATTCTCACCGCGACCTCTTGCG) and the following specific forward primers: P1 (ATGGATCCAACGCCGAGGACCAGAAC), P2 (ATGGATCCGCCGCTGAGTCCCTCGAC), and P3 (ATGGATCCGAGCCTCTCGCTGACCAG); these fragments were then subcloned into the BamH1 and XhoI sites of a modified pcDNA3 vector encoding an N-terminal Myc epitope (MEQKLISEEDLNMA). Genes encoding the R44L, Δ29–34, F90A/Y91A, and Δ29–34-F90A/Y91A p57 mutants were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the following mutagenic primer pairs: R44L (ACGAGGAGCTGAGCCTCGAGCTGCAGGCCC and GGGCCTGCAGCTCGAGGCTCAGCTCCTCGT); Δ29–34 (CTAGTGCGCACCAGCD TTCGGGCCGGTGGAC and GTGCACCGGCCCGAAD GCTGGTGCGCACTAG); F90A/Y91A (TCGGTGCCCGCGGCCGCCCGCGAGACGGTG and CACCGTCTCGCGGGCGGCCGCGGGCACCGA). Correct introduction of all mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. The GST-N-terminal p57 KIP2 fusion protein was obtained by subcloning the BamH1/XhoI fragment from pcDNA3.9E10p57 into pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfection—The human osteosarcoma cell line Saos-2 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells at 50% confluence were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously (8Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cell extracts were prepared for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays as described (5Lam E.W.-F. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) or for IP/Western blot experiments. Western Blot and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—Transfected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 500 μl of IP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 220 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the recommended concentration of a protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation and 10% retained as input. The remainders were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 50 μl of protein G beads (50% slurry in IP buffer; Amersham Biosciences) coupled to specific antibodies by mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by brief microcentrifugation and washed rapidly three times with IP buffer. Immunoprecipitates and the input samples were subjected to Western blotting. The antibodies used for these analyses were: mouse monoclonal antibodies to p21 WAF1 (Santa Cruz F-5), p27 KIP1 (Santa Cruz F-8), cyclin A (Sigma), cyclin E (Neomarker HE12), cdk2 (Santa Cruz D-12), c-Myc (9E10: a gift from Dr. Xin Lu), and hemagglutinin (HA.11: BAbCO) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p57 KIP2 (Santa Cruz C-20), B-Myb (Santa Cruz N-19), c-Myb (431: raised to a peptide comprising amino acids 622–636), cyclin A (Santa Cruz H-432), c-Myc (Santa Cruz A-14), and phosphoRB-S807/S811 (Cell Signaling). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from DAKO, and these were detected on Western blots with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). In Vitro Translation and Protein Association Assays—Proteins were synthesized in a coupled T7 RNA polymerase/rabbit reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (TnT, Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. Proteins were allowed to associate by mixing the programmed reticulocyte lysates with baculovirus-expressed B-Myb and cyclin A2 at 30 °C for 30 min as described previously (11Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2679-2689Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 10% of the mixture was retained (Input), and the remainder was subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. Proteins were detected by Western blotting or by autoradiography and phosphorimaging of labeled proteins. Cell Cycle Analysis—Saos-2 cells seeded at 50% confluency on 10-cm dishes were co-transfected with 15 μg of pcDNA3/B-myb, the indicated amounts of pcDNA3.9E10p57 and 2 μg of pCMV.CD20 (encoding the cell surface marker CD20). The total amount of transfected DNA was kept at 30 μg by adding the appropriate amount of pcDNA3 empty vector. Cells were detached 2 days post-transfection by washing with 3 mm EDTA in PBS and then stained in 100 μl of PBS with 20 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled CD20 antibodies (BD Biosciences). After overnight fixation at 4 °C with 70% ethanol, cells were stained in PBS containing 18 μg/ml propidium iodide and 8 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Transfected CD20-positive cells were discriminated from untransfected cells by flow cytometry with a BD Biosciences FACSort using the FL1 channel, and the cell cycle profiles were obtained and quantified in the FL2A channel using CellQuest and FlowJo software. Complex Formation between B-Myb and p57KIP2—It has been shown previously that B-Myb is able to overcome a G1 block imposed by either p53 or p107 (16Lin D. Fiscella M. O'Connor P.M. Jackman J. Chen M. Luo L.L. Sala A. Travali S. Appella E. Mercer W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10079-10083Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 21Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular basis for these effects, we have studied in some detail the functional and physical interactions between B-Myb and p107 (22Bessa M. Joaquin M. Tavner F. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We found that the ability of B-Myb to counter p107-mediated G1 arrest depends on a direct interaction with an N-terminal domain of p107. This p107 domain overlaps with a larger domain required for cyclin/Cdk2 binding, and it is notable that mutation of the N-terminal cyclin-binding motif in p107 abrogated binding to B-Myb. Because this motif is partially conserved in CKIs of the Cip/Kip family, namely p21Cip1/Waf1, p27 KIP1 , and p57 KIP2 , we tested whether B-Myb could also bind to these proteins. The three CKIs were 35S-labeled using a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system and independently mixed with baculovirus-expressed B-Myb or cyclin A2. 10% of the mixture was kept as input, and the remainder was subjected to co-immunoprecipitation analysis. p57 KIP2 was successfully co-immunoprecipitated with a specific B-Myb antibody, whereas p21Cip1/Waf1 was co-immunoprecipitated to a lesser extent and p27 KIP1 was not brought down at all (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, all three CKIs were co-immunoprecipitated in control experiments with cyclin A2, as expected (Fig. 1B). To further substantiate these observations, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with either B-Myb or cyclin A2 expression plasmids together with plasmids encoding p21Cip1/Waf1, p27 KIP1 , or p57 KIP2. Lysates were made from these cells 2 days post-transfection; 10% of the cell lysates were retained, and the remainders were subjected to immunoprecipitation using B-Myb and cyclin A2 antibodies. Although all three CKIs co-immunoprecipitated with cyclin A2, only p57 KIP2 was efficiently brought down by B-Myb antibodies, indicating that B-Myb binds specifically to p57 KIP2 among the Cip/Kip family (Fig. 1C). We were also interested in knowing if the ability of B-Myb to interact with p57 KIP2 was shared with other members of the Myb family. To address this question, Saos-2 cells were co-transfected with either B-Myb or c-Myb expression plasmids together with a plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged p57 KIP2. A polyclonal Myc antibody was used to immunoprecipitate p57 KIP2 , and the presence of B-Myb and c-Myb in the co-immunoprecipitate was assessed on a Western blot using specific antibodies. This indicated that p57 KIP2 co-immunoprecipitated B-Myb considerably better than c-Myb, as evidenced by a comparison of the relative intensities of the input and co-immunoprecipitated signals (Fig. 1D). B-Myb Interacts with the Cyclin/Cdk-binding Domain of p57KIP2—To identify the p57 KIP2 region involved in B-Myb binding, we generated p57 KIP2 mutants truncated at the C and N termini (Fig. 2A). Mutant proteins were subsequently 35S-labeled using a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system and mixed individually with baculovirus-expressed B-Myb or cyclin A2. The mixtures were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against B-Myb and cyclin A2. The inputs and immunoprecipitates were analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel, and the labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Western blot analysis was also carried out to monitor that equal amounts of proteins had been immunoprecipitated. These experiments showed that both cyclin A2 and B-Myb bound to an N-terminal fragment of p57 KIP2 (amino acids 1–129), which contains the cyclin/Cdk-binding domain (Fig. 2B). In contrast, minimal binding of B-Myb and cyclin A2 was observed to C-terminal fragments (amino acids 122–316 or 240–316). These results indicate that B-Myb binds to a region of p57 KIP2 that overlaps with its cyclin/Cdk-binding domain, and this situation is reminiscent of the interaction of B-Myb with the p107 N-terminal cyclin-binding domain (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The p57 KIP2 cyclin-binding domain is composed of three different motifs that are involved in cyclin/Cdk binding and inhibition: (i) the cyclin binding region (CBP1), (ii) the Cdk binding region (KB), and (iii) the 310-helix region (Fig. 3A). In addition, this domain contains a putative α-helical region, linking the CBP1 and the KB motifs, which has been reported to be essential for binding the muscle-specific transcription factor MyoD (26Reynaud E.G. Leibovitch M.P. Tintignac L.A.J. Pelpel K. Guillier M. Leibovitch S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18767-18776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To characterize further the N-terminal regions of p57 KIP2 required for binding to B-Myb, small deletions and point mutations were introduced into this region. It was of particular interest to investigate the role of the CBP1 motif in this interaction, because this motif is homologous to the N-terminal p107 cyclin-binding motif (ACRK), which was found to contribute to B-Myb binding (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, a 6-amino acid deletion (Δ29–34) was introduced into the CBP1 motif. Additionally, point mutations were introduced into the α-helical region and the 310-helix (R44L and F90A/Y91A: Fig. 3A): equivalent mutations in mouse p57 KIP2 were found to reduce association with MyoD and cyclin A2, respectively (26Reynaud E.G.

To assess the effects of these mutations on the inhibition of cyclinA2/Cdk2 activity, we monitored the phosphorylation levels of a C-terminal fragment of pRb (Rb C792–928) in co-transfected Saos-2 cells using a phosphospecific antibody on Western blots. In this assay, wt p57 KIP2 inhibited cyclin A/Cdk2-mediated RB phosphorylation almost entirely, and similar levels of CKI activity was observed with the R44L mutant in which the α-helical region was mutated (Fig. 3B). In contrast, deletion within the CBP1 motif (Δ29–34) and point mutation of the 310-helix region (F90A/Y91A), or a combination of these two mutations, abolished the CKI activity as expected (Fig. 3B). We then compared the ability of these mutants to interact with cyclin A2 and B-Myb. WT and mutant p57 KIP2 proteins were 35S-labeled in a rabbit reticulocyte in vitro transcription/translation system and mixed individually with baculovirus-expressed B-Myb or cyclin A2. Following co-immunoprecipitation with B-Myb and cyclin A2 antibodies, the labeled p57 KIP2 proteins were displayed on SDS-PAGE gels and quantitated by phosphorimaging. Taking the binding to wt p57 KIP2 as 100%, it is evident that the R44L mutation had no effect on the ability of this protein to interact with either cyclin A2 or B-Myb (Fig. 3C). This finding suggests that, in contrast to interactions with MyoD, this region of p57 KIP2 does not contribute significantly to binding B-Myb. Mutation of either the CBP1 domain or the 310-helix severely reduced binding to cyclin A2 (Fig. 3C), however, in each instance binding to B-Myb was reduced by only approximately half. B-Myb binding was further reduced to 25% in a p57 KIP2 mutant harboring mutations in both these motifs (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that, although the p57 KIP2 motifs required for cyclin A2/Cdk2 association contribute to B-Myb binding, they do not have the same overarching significance for this interaction as they do for binding cyclin A2/Cdk2. It is clear overall, however, that the region of p57 KIP2 that interacts with B-Myb overlaps with the N-terminal cyclin/Cdk inhibitory domain. In this respect, the interaction of B-Myb with p57 KIP2 has parallels with its interaction with p107. p57KIP2 Interacts with an N-terminal Domain of B-Myb— Binding of B-Myb to p107 was found to be abolished by even quite small C-terminal deletions of B-Myb (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether interactions with p57 KIP2 required similar B-Myb domains, we tested the B-Myb deletion series used previously with p107 in in vivo binding assays with p57 KIP2 (Fig. 4A). Expression plasmids encoding wt B-Myb and the truncated variants were co-transfected into Saos-2 cells with a plasmid encoding Myc epitope-tagged p57 KIP2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a B-Myb antibody, and the proteins pulled down were detected on a Western blot (Fig. 4B). It was found that p57 KIP2 was effectively co-immunoprecipitated by all the C-terminally truncated B-Myb mutants, including the most extensively deleted B-Myb+394 mutant. This indicates that regions C-terminal to amino acid 394 are not required for binding p57 KIP2 , and this situation differs dramatically from that observed with p107, where even removal of 29 amino acids at the C terminus (as in B-Myb+675) eliminated interactions between the two proteins (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Most deletions within the B-Myb transactivation domain also abolished binding to p107, however, the sequence between amino acids 205–243 was not absolutely required for this activity (23Joaquin M. Bessa M. Saville M.K. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether deletions within the B-Myb transactivation domain affected p57 KIP2 interactions. Binding of p57 KIP2 was also unaffected in the B-MybΔ205–243 mutant, moreover, deletion of other sequences within the transactivation domain (as in B-MybΔ244–288 and Δ310–332) and a further C-terminal deletion to amino acid 348 (as in B-Myb+348) also had no effect on binding activity (Fig. 4C). Altogether, these data show that an N-terminal region of B-Myb t"

Here we characterize template properties of the 5′ and 3′ fragments obtained by cleaving one of such RNAs at an internal site. We unexpectedly found that, besides the 3′ fragment, Qβ replicase can copy the 5′ fragment and a number of its variants, although they lack the initiator region of RQ RNA. This copying can occur as a 3′-terminal elongation or through de novo initiation. In contradistinction to RQ RNA and its 3′ fragment, initiation on these templates occurs without regard to the 3′-terminal or internal oligo(C) clusters, is GTP-independent, and does not result in a stable replicative complex capable of elongation in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid. The results suggest that, although Qβ replicase can initiate and elongate on a variety of RNAs, only some of them are recognized as legitimate templates. GTP-dependent initiation on a legitimate template drives the enzyme to a “closed” conformation that may be important for keeping the template and the complementary nascent strand unannealed, without which the exponential replication is impossible. Triggering the GTP-dependent conformational transition at the initiation step could serve as a discriminative feature of legitimate templates providing for the high template specificity of Qβ replicase.

The natural source of RQ RNAs is Qβ phage itself or Qβ phage-infected Escherichia coli cells where these RNAs are formed by recombination from viral and/or cellular RNAs and propagated (1Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Van Duin J. Calendar R. The Bacteriophages, Vol. 1.

Recently, many new RQ RNAs have been selected from random (4Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or artificially designed (5Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) sequences, or produced by in vitro RNA recombination (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The amplification of these RNAs is exponential as long as the enzyme is in molar excess: the number of RNA molecules doubles in each round of replication, because both the original RNA and its complementary copy are replicase templates. Approximately 104 copies of a single genomic RNA molecule are produced in a Qβ phage-infected E. coli cell in less than 1 h (8Weissmann C. FEBS Lett. 1974; 40: S10-S18Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Amplification of small RQ RNAs is much faster: up to 1010 copies are produced at room temperature within 10 min in a cell-free system comprised of purified Qβ replicase and all four NTPs (3Chetverin A.B. Spirin A.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 225-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this is the absolute record of the rate of nucleic acid amplification. The high amplification rate allows single RQ RNA molecules to rapidly produce detectable molecular colonies if they are amplified in a gel (9Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Munishkin A.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2349-2353Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).However, Qβ replicase does not amplify most RNAs, including any tested cellular RNAs or genomic RNAs of other viruses. Selection experiments indicated that only a few of the initial diversity of 1012 unique sequences of 50–77 nt in length are replicable (4Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), demonstrating a very high degree of template specificity of the enzyme. Now, almost 40 years since its discovery (11Haruna I. Spiegelman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), this specificity remains a mystery. Qβ replicase discriminates between templates in the absence of sequence-specific primers or promoters (3Chetverin A.B. Spirin A.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 225-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and hence its strategy must be different from those commonly employed by DNA polymerases and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases.Previous studies identified several structural features of Qβ replicase templates as follows: (i) Oligo(C) cluster, usually CCC, at the 3′ end and the complementary oligo(G) at the 5′ end. No other common sequence elements were detected. The oligo(C) was found to serve as the initiation signal (1Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 12Tretheway D.M. Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11373-11383Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 13Feix G.

A. 1975; 72: 2640-2643Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with GTP being the initiating nucleotide (1Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Feix G. Sano H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 58: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 15Hori K. Eoyang L. Banerjee A.K.

A. 1974; 71: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of the 5′-terminal oligo(G) is believed to code for the oligo(C) at the 3′ end of the complementary strand (17Weissmann C. Billeter M.A. Goodman H.M. Hindley J. Weber H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1973; 42: 303-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Two C residues are enough (18Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but initiation is more efficient with CCC or longer clusters (12Tretheway D.M. Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11373-11383Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The 3′-most nucleotide of the product strands is A, which is not coded by the template and is added during strand termination. The 3′-terminal A is not copied and is dispensable for replication (19Rensing U. August J.T. Nature. 1969; 224: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but increases the efficacy of initiation and serves as a punctuation mark making the penultimate C the preferred initiation site (18Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). At elevated concentrations of GTP (20Blumenthal T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or in the presence of Mn2+ ions (16Palmenberg A. Kaesberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), Qβ replicase can copy heterologous RNAs, including those lacking the 3′-terminal oligo(C). However, even in this case the first nucleotide of the product strand is pppG (1Blumenthal T. Carmichael G.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 525-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 16Palmenberg A. Kaesberg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), in agreement with the fact that Qβ replicase can initiate on internal oligo(C) clusters that are not hidden in the secondary structure (18Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 21Yoshinari S. Nagy P.D. Simon A.E. Dreher T.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). (ii) Unpaired 3′-terminal oligo(C), with the 5′-terminal oligo(G) being base-paired elsewhere (5Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Biebricher C.K. Luce R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4848-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This requirement can be understood as a means to ensure unrestricted access of Qβ replicase to the initiation site. (iii) Internal 8- to 15-nt-long pyrimidine-rich segments (4Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14765-14774Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The presence in an RNA of such segments, selectively bound by the protein synthesis factor EF-Tu, one of the four Qβ replicase subunits (24Brown D. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), results in a 10-fold increase of the RNA affinity to the replicase (4Brown D. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14775-14782Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Preuss R. Dapprich J. Walter N.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 600-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). (iv) Folding of most of the RNA chain into long stable hairpins. The insertion of unstructured segments decreases the template activity of a replicable RNA (26Axelrod V.D. Brown E. Priano C. Mills D.R. Virology. 1991; 184: 595-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The stable secondary structure is believed to play an important role in maintaining the single-strandedness of the replicative intermediate, which is vital for the exponential amplification (27Weissmann C. Feix G. Slor H. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1968; 33: 83-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).Obviously, this list of requirements is too unrestrictive, and it cannot explain the observed degree of the template specificity of the enzyme. Artificial RNAs designed in accordance with the above rules, are poor templates (5Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 24Brown D. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11558-11562Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, they sometimes acquire the ability to replicate upon a number of mutations whose structural significance is not well understood (5Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This means that there must be important, not yet identified features that make RNA replicable.In this work, we investigated template properties of RNAs obtained by cleaving RQ135 RNA (28Munishkin A.V. Voronin L.A. Ugarov V.I. Bondareva L.A. Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) into two fragments and compared them with the properties of the intact RQ RNA. Whereas the 3′ fragment inherited the initiation oligo(C) cluster, the 5′ fragment inherited the 5′ terminal oligo(G). Because the two clusters were in separate molecules, we did not expect the exponential amplification and analyzed the ability of the fragments to direct the synthesis of their complementary copies. Unexpectedly we found that, although only the 3′ fragment inherited the initiator oligo(C) cluster, the 5′ fragment was also capable of template activity allowing Qβ replicase to initiate and elongate. However, whereas the enzyme recognizes the 3′ fragment in the same way as it does with the intact RQ RNA, a quite different mechanism is employed for the initiation of RNA synthesis on the 5′ fragment and a number of its derivatives, although they meet the structural criteria cited above. The most striking features of the new mechanism are that the initiation can occur without regard to oligo(C) clusters and in the absence of GTP, and does not lead to the formation of a stable replicative complex that is characteristic of typical Qβ replicase templates.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESQβ Replicase and Its Templates—A highly purified enzyme (29Berestowskaya N.H. Vasiliev V.D. Volkov A.A. Chetverin A.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was isolated from Escherichia coli HB101 cells transfected with plasmid pREP, carrying the catalytic (β) replicase subunit downstream the temperature-inducible PR promoter of phage λ (30Shaklee P.N. Miglietta J.J. Palmenberg A.C. Kaesberg P. Virology. 1988; 163: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), using a procedure based on the published protocol (31Blumenthal T. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 60: 628-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The variant of RQ135 RNA used here was prepared by transcription of SmaI-digested plasmid pT7RQ135–1(–) (32Morozov I.Y. Ugarov V.I. Chetverin A.B. Spirin A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9325-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) modified by inserting CGAUCC between positions 52 and 53 of the original RQ135–1(–) sequence (28Munishkin A.V. Voronin L.A. Ugarov V.I. Bondareva L.A. Chetverina H.V. Chetverin A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); the template properties of this variant were indistinguishable from those of the authentic RQ135 RNA. The 3′ fragment of RQ135 RNA was prepared by transcription with T7 RNA polymerase as described earlier (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The 11 variants of the 5′ fragment were obtained by run-off transcription of a plasmid in which the first 52 nucleotides of the RQ135 sequence were inserted, together with upstream T7 promoter, between sites HindIII and PstI of the plasmid pUC18 multiple cloning sites (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). By cutting the plasmid at restriction sites located downstream of the inserted RQ sequence, eight “nested” variants of the 5′ fragment were obtained and designated after the respective restriction sites. Three more variants (Δ fragments) were obtained by deleting from the plasmid a 25-bp-long segment between sites PstI and SmaI (Fig. 1A). All transcripts were gel-purified (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Where indicated, RNAs were oxidized with sodium periodate (33Steinschneider A. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); the extent of the 3′-terminal modification was close to 100%, judging by the inhibition of 3′-OH-dependent RNA recombination and by a streptavidin-induced gel-shift of the RNA biotinylated at the oxidized end (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).RNA Synthesis—Reactions were carried out during 10 min at 22 °C in 10-μl aliquots containing replicase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA), 0.5 μm Qβ replicase (M r 199,958), 0.05 μm RNA template, 1 mm each of ATP, UTP, [α-32P]CTP (50–200 mCi/mmol) and indicated concentration of GTP, and stopped by adding 5 μl of 50 mm EDTA. Templates were pre-melted by heating in 0.2-ml PCR tubes (at a 10× concentration in 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0) during 2 min in boiling water bath followed by a transfer to ice-cold water. Labeled nucleotides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Product Analysis—Samples were consecutively extracted with 10 μl of phenol and 10 μl of chloroform, mixed with 4.5 μl of sample buffer containing 50% glycerol and subjected to non-denaturing electrophoresis (34Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) through a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 10% glycerol, with temperature of the electrode buffer being maintained at 10–12 °C. All RNA bands were revealed by silver staining (35Igloi G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas labeled products were detected by scanning with a Cyclone™ phosphorimaging device (Packard Instrument). Where indicated, reaction products were melted prior to electrophoresis. To this end, phenol- and chloroformextracted samples were precipitated with ethyl alcohol (following the addition of 10 μg of linear polyacrylamide (36Gaillard C. Strauss F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 378Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and NaCl to 0.5 m); pellets were twice washed with 96% alcohol, dissolved in 10 μl of 0.1 mm Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, and melted as above.Probing of Products with S1 Nuclease—After the extraction with phenol and chloroform and precipitation with alcohol as above, samples were treated with 200 units of nuclease S1 during 30 min at 37 °C in 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ZnSO4. The reaction was stopped by the addition of EDTA to 10 mm, NaCl to 0.5 m, and SDS to 0.5%, and samples were again extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with alcohol. Control experiments had shown that such a treatment completely destroyed ssRNA, while leaving dsRNA intact.RESULTSRNAs Derived from the 5′ Portion of RQ RNA and Lacking Its Initiator Sequence Are Qβ Replicase Templates—In the course of studies on RNA recombination between the supplementing 5′ and 3′ fragments of RQ135 RNA (6Chetverin A.B.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) we unexpectedly noted that Qβ replicase can copy each of these fragments, although the initiator oligo(C) cluster was at the 3′ fragment only. We prepared eleven 5′ fragment variants that were extended at the 3′ end with sequences derived from the pUC18 multiple cloning sites (see “Experimental Procedures”). This resulted in an array of RNAs with altered initiation regions (Fig. 1A) as well as altered folding (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Predicted secondary structures of the RNAs studied.

As in the case of the 3′ fragment, the product is mainly comprised of a dsRNA consisting of the original template and the labeled complementary copy. This follows from the ability of the labeled material to be completely or partially melted producing a band whose mobility is identical or similar to that of the template (Fig. 1B) and from its resistance to nuclease S1 (see below, Fig. 4D).Fig. 4Probing the mechanisms for copying the 5′ fragment variants.

This result is unexpected and apparently contradicts the established principles of template recognition by Qβ replicase, according to which the 5′ fragment variants lacking oligo(C) at the 3′ end should be either not copied at all or copied at elevated GTP concentration, beginning at the internal oligo(C) clusters (18Yoshinari S. Dreher T.W. Virology. 2000; 271: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If the latter were true, copying would give rise to products of a few fixed sizes, 50 nt, 78 nt, and perhaps 85 nt (cf. Fig. 1A; the products might be 1 nt longer if untemplated A was added at termination). The absence of significant initiation from the internal oligo(C) clusters is probably caused by these clusters being hidden in the secondary structure (cf. Fig. 2 and Ref. 21Yoshinari S. Nagy P.D. Simon A.E. Dreher T.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Notably, template activities of the 5′ fragment variants do not correlate with their 3′-terminal sequences and are independent of the presence of oligo(C) clusters at the 3′ end. For example, fragment SmaI ending with the canonical sequence CCCC is a poor template, whereas fragment BamHI ending with AUC and fragment EcoRI ending with AAUU are good templates. Furthermore, although fragments ΔSacI and ΔEcoRI have the 3′ termini identical to those of fragments SacI and EcoRI, respectively, the former are much poorer templates than the latter. This might suggest that template activity of the 5′ fragment variants is mainly determined by their secondary and/or tertiary structures, rather than by primary structures.Secondary structures of the 5′ fragments (Fig. 2) predicted by the minimal free energy algorithm (37Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) do not reveal a clear-cut correlation with the template activity. In most cases, the results comply with previously formulated rules (5Zamora H. Luce R. Biebricher C.K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Biebricher C.K. Luce R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4848-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): good templates (fragments BamHI, SacI, and EcoRI) have their 5′ termini involved in helices and their 3′ termini unpaired, whereas poor templates (SmaI, KpnI, and ΔSacI) have their 3′ termini hidden in the secondary structures. Yet, it remains unclear why fragment PstI is worse than BamHI and why ΔEcoRI is worse than EcoRI. However, the validity of the rules based on the analysis of predicted structures is questioned by our observation that self-annealing of many of the RNAs studied in this work decreased their template activity, whereas melting increased it (not shown). Although this observation indicates that the manner in which RNA molecule is folded is important for its template activity, it also suggests that the energetically most favorable foldings, which are attained as a result of annealing and which are predicted by computer algorithms, are not necessarily the structures preferred by the enzyme.GTP Requirements of the 5′ Fragment Variants Are Very Low and Do Not Correlate with Their Template Activities—The concentration of the initiating nucleotide (GTP) required for the copying of a particular Qβ replicase template was reported to be a measure of its quality: the better template the lower GTP concentration is needed (20Blumenthal T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It would be natural to expect that cleavage of a perfect replicable RNA should impair its recognition by Qβ replicase, and of the two resulting fragments, the 3′ fragment should have lower GTP requirement, because it inherited the initiator region of RQ135 RNA. Contrary to what we expected, copying of fragments BamHI, EcoRI, and PstI (judging by the appearance of labeled dsRNA) becomes detectable at a very low GTP concentration, ≤1 μm, which is two orders of magnitude lower than is required for copying the 3′ fragment and an order of magnitude lower than is required for copying RQ135 RNA (Fig. 3). A similar GTP dependence is observed for other 5′ fragment variants (not shown), with the only exception of fragment SacI whose GTP requirement resembles that of RQ135 RNA.Fig. 3Effect of GTP concentration on RNA synthesis. Band intensities for each template were adjusted by varying the specific radioactivity, exposure time, and signal enhancement and do not reflect the template activity. Arrows indicate template locations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another unusual feature of the 5′ fragment variants is that similar GTP dependences are observed for good (BamHI and EcoRI) and poor (PstI) templates (cf. Fig. 1B). Their GTP requirements are saturated at ≈3 μm and, contrary to what we expected (20Blumenthal T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2601-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a further increase in the concentration of the initiating nucleotide does not help to involve the poorer template in replication.Plurality of Mechanisms for Copying the 5′ Fragment Variants—The unexpected GTP dependence of the 5′ fragment variants led us to a series of experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanism Qβ replicase uses for copying these templates. Surprisingly, it turned out that there is no single mechanism common to all the variants; rather, there exist diverse mechanisms whose relative contribution varies from template to template.At first, we found that 5′ fragment variants differently responded to oxidation with sodium periodate (Fig. 4A), which eliminates the 3′-hydroxyl group (33Steinschneider A. Fraenkel-Conrat H. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) thereby preventing the addition of nucleotides to the 3′ end of RNA. For example, copying of the EcoRI fragment was drastically reduced, suggesting that most of the dsRNA product was formed as a result of the 3′-terminal elongation. This inhibition was not caused by traces of periodate or by-products of the oxidation reaction, because the addition of the oxidized preparation did not reduce label incorporation on the native fragment (Fig. 4A). Earlier, Qβ replicase was found to be able of elongating RNAs at the 3′ end to various extents by copying the 3′-proxymal region of the template, but the formation of full-sized dsRNAs was never observed (38Biebricher C.K. Luce R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5129-5135Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contradistinction to EcoRI, fragment BamHI remained to be efficiently copied upon oxidation, as did RQ135 RNA (6Chetverin A.B. Chetverina H.V. Demidenko A.A. Ugarov V.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 503-513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and Qβ RNA (19Rensing U. August J.T. Nature. 1969; 224: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Sc"

Insertion of stop codons within the transcript that blocked either translation of the entire protein or parts of the protein required for co-translation insertion of Ole1p had no effect.

Unsaturated fatty acids are essential components of membrane lipids that determine in large part the fluid properties of membrane bilayers. In eukaryotes, unsaturated fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid desaturases that form double bonds in fatty acyl chains by an iron-requiring, oxygen-dependent mechanism. Because of the need to stringently control the acyl composition of membrane lipids, fatty acid desaturases are highly regulated enzymes that respond to a number of stimuli, including changes in environmental temperature, nutrient fatty acids, and cellular oxygen levels. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unsaturated fatty acids are formed by Ole1p, a membrane-bound Δ-9 desaturase that converts long chain saturated fatty acyl-CoA substrates into monounsaturated species (1Stukey J.E.

Although most studies of gene regulation are focused on mechanisms that control the rate of transcription, mRNA degradation systems are now known to play a central role in the control of gene expression. The half-life of an mRNA species determines the number of times an individual transcript can be translated, which in turn affects the total amount of protein that can be produced by a gene at a given rate of transcription. This importance of mRNA degradation in determining the level of expression of specific genes is supported by studies that show that the decay rates of different mRNAs vary widely, and the half-lives of some transcripts have been shown to change in response to specific signals (5Gonzalez C.I.

Only a few examples of regulated mRNA decay in response to external cues have been described in yeast. Two genes from S. cerevisiae have been shown to respond to the changes in carbon source that are associated with the diauxic shift during which cells adapt to glucose depleted conditions. The SDH2 rate of mRNA turnover depends on the availability of glucose (12Prieto S. de la Cruz B.J. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14155-14166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When glucose is added to cells previously grown on the non-fermentable carbon source, glycerol, the half-life of the transcript drops from >60 min to ∼5–7 min (10Lombardo A. Cereghino G.P. Scheffler I.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2941-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Prieto S. de la Cruz B.J. Scheffler I.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1125-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). By contrast, the TIF51A transcript is stabilized in glucosegrown cells, with a half-life of 20 min that drops to 7 min when cells are transferred to glycerol-containing medium (14Vasudevan S. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The half-life of the OLE1 transcript is also regulated when cells are exposed to unsaturated fatty acids. Yeast cells readily import long chain (C14-C18) acids and incorporate them into membrane lipids, resulting in the down-regulation of OLE1 transcription (4Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and a rapid decrease in the half-life of its mRNA (5Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In cells grown in fatty acid-free medium, OLE1 mRNA is a moderately stable species with a half-life of about 10 ± 1.5 min (5Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas exposure to unsaturated fatty acids for 15 min reduces its half-life to less than 2 min. Progress has recently been made in understanding the general mechanisms by which the process of mRNA degradation occurs. In Saccharomyces, many transcripts appear to be degraded through a general pathway of mRNA decay that is initiated by deadenylation of the poly(A) tail (15Decker C.J. Parker R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1632-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 16Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 18Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The subsequent displacement of poly(A)-binding proteins that stabilize the binding of translation initiation factors to the 5′ cap makes the transcript competent for decapping by the enzymes Dcp1p and Dcp2p. After removal of the 5′ cap, the mRNA is rapidly degraded by the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease, Xrn1p. Alternatively, some mRNAs can be degraded in a 3′-5′ direction by exonucleases that are associated with the exosome complex (19Jacobs J.S. Anderson A.R. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The rate of the deadenylation and decapping reactions for each transcript appears to be controlled by widely divergent sequence elements in different mRNAs (17Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), indicating that these common functions in the general decay pathway respond to a number of different regulatory mechanisms. Translation also appears to play an important role in governing the decay of some transcripts in the general pathway. For some mRNAs, sequences that promote efficient translation also stabilize the transcript (17Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 20LaGrandeur T. Parker R. RNA (N. Y.). 1999; 5: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, mutants that interfere with ribosomal loading and translation initiation promote increased rates of deadenylation (17Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5247-5256Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 18Schwartz D.C. Parker R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7933-7942Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and mutations that alter the context of the start codon can destabilize the highly stable PGK1 mRNAs. A second translation-dependent decay pathway involves the degradation of aberrant mRNAs. In that system, the introduction of premature stop codons into protein coding sequences destabilizes some transcripts (21Hagan K.W. Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Quan Y. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 809-823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The termination of translation at the nonsense codon and the assembly of a surveillance complex triggers the rapid decapping and degradation of the mRNA (22Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Peltz S.W. Cell. 2000; 101: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Transcripts that are degraded by the nonsense decay pathway require the presence of a destabilizing element 3′ to the premature stop codon (23Ruiz-Echevarria M.J. Gonzalez C.I. Peltz S.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Elements within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; OLE1, gene encoding Ole1p, a Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase; FAH1, gene encoding a C-26 fatty acid hydroxylase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAL1 promoter, yeast galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible elements; TM, transmembrane loop; ARE, AU-rich element; kb, kilobase; SOE, PCR splicing by overlap extension.1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; OLE1, gene encoding Ole1p, a Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase; FAH1, gene encoding a C-26 fatty acid hydroxylase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GAL1 promoter, yeast galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible elements; TM, transmembrane loop; ARE, AU-rich element; kb, kilobase; SOE, PCR splicing by overlap extension. of many eukaryotic mRNAs also play an important role in governing mRNA stability. The decay rate of a number of regulated transcripts are controlled by AU-rich elements (AREs) located within the 3′-UTR, and mutations in those elements have been shown to reduce the rate of poly(A) degradation and the overall rate of decay (14Vasudevan S. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The role of AREs in mRNAs appears to be somewhat variable, suggesting that they may recognize more than one type of binding protein. An ARE in the yeast MFA2 transcript, for example, destabilizes the mRNA under all tested growth conditions, whereas the ARE in the glucose-sensitive TIF51A transcript acts as the primary determinant of its carbon source-regulated decay (14Vasudevan S. Peltz S.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An important part of understanding how mRNA stability is controlled requires identifying and characterizing the RNA elements that regulate its turnover. Unlike DNA binding proteins, trans-acting RNA-binding proteins that stabilize or destabilize transcripts rarely recognize distinct nucleotide sequences and instead bind to relatively long elements, which suggests that the context and secondary structure of the sequences play key roles in the process. We previously determined that some elements involved in the OLE1 mRNA stability control mechanism are associated with the 5′-UTR of the transcript. Replacing the native 5′-UTR with sequences from the yeast GAL1 5′-UTR produces a functional OLE1 transcript with an intermediate half-life that is not regulated by unsaturated fatty acids (5Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Those results suggested that the 5′-UTR of OLE1 mRNA contains sequence elements required for fatty acid-triggered destabilization. Although these elements appear to be necessary for the generation of a normal half-life, they do not appear to be sufficient to establish the normal control of basal and regulated stability of the mRNA. In this paper, using a series of deletion and substitution mutations, we identify multiple, widely separated elements within the protein-coding sequence of the OLE1 transcript that are essential for its basal stability. These encode residues that are a part of the membrane-spanning regions of the protein and a part of its C-terminal cytochrome b 5 domain. Unexpectedly, the substitution of the 3′-UTR region of the transcript with that of the highly stable PGK1 gene does not stabilize the transcript or block its fatty acid-regulated stability. Given that the Δ-9 desaturase is a major determinant of membrane fluid properties, we also investigated whether membrane-associated translation of the protein is involved in the mRNA stability regulation mechanism. Insertion of stop codons throughout the transcript, however, including those that block translation of the membrane-spanning regions failed to affect either basal or regulated stability of the transcript. We conclude that OLE1 mRNA stability is regulated by a novel system that is resistant to nonsense-mediated decay and the presence of AU-rich 3′-UTR elements. We further conclude that the membrane-associated translation of the Ole1p is not an integral part of the decay process. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are shown in Table I.

The cells were grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic medium plus 1% Tergitol Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) lacking appropriate amino acids (based on the selectable marker used in the incorporated plasmid). Typically, the carbon source was 2% glucose. However, when the cells contained the gene of interest fused to a galactose-inducible promoter, they were grown overnight in medium containing 2% raffinose. 2% galactose or 2% glucose was added to the growth medium when required to induce or repress transcription of genes under the control of the GAL1 promoter. Unsaturated fatty acids (obtained from Sigma) were added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1 mm. Thiolutin (received as a gift from Pfizer) was added to a final concentration of 15 μg/ml. Methods for general DNA manipulations were performed after procedures described in Ausubel et al.

Galuska. pGAL-OLE-BstEIIΔ was created by complete digestion of plasmid pGAL-OLE2.8 (5Gonzalez C.I. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25801-25809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with BstEII followed by isolation and religation of a 10.1-kb DNA fragment. Similarly, pGAL-OLE-NcoIΔ was constructed by complete digestion of pGAL-OLE2.8 with NcoI. Transmembrane loops of OLE1 gene were replaced by amplification of the entire FAH1 TM region using primers with an incorporated AflIII site. Plasmid p(–B)HpaI was created by destroying the unique BstX1 site in plasmid pCRScriptSK+. This was followed by insertion of an HpaI fragment encompassing the entire OLE1 gene cloned into the SrfI site to generate plasmid pMV055. The previous PCR product was digested with AflIII and cloned into the NcoI sites of the OLE1 gene in plasmid p(–B)HpaI, replacing both of its TM elements with FAH1 TMs. An OLE1 gene fragment derived from p(–B)HpaI that contains all of the protein-coding sequences distal to TM1 and including 1 kb of 3′-UTR was then cloned adjacent to the FAH1 TM1 in plasmid pMV055 to generate pMV056. A SnaBI/PacI fragment from pMV056 containing the entire modified protein coding sequences was then cloned into the same sites in vector pGAL-OLE-207 to generate pMV057 (pGAL-OLE-FAHtm1). To replace OLE1 TM2, a fragment that contains the OLE1 5′-UTR and the N-terminal part of the OLE1 protein-coding sequence (759 bp) including TM1, was amplified using primers prMV043 and prMV051 from plasmid p(–B)HpaI. In a separate reaction, FAH1 TM2, part of the OLE1-coding sequence and the OLE1 3′-UTR were amplified using primers prMV052 and prMV048 from plasmid pMV055. The two PCR products were fused by the SOE technique followed by digestion with restriction enzymes XbaI/HindIII and insertion into the same sites in plasmid pGAL-OLE-207 to create pGAL-OLE-FAHtm2. To replace both OLE1 TMs, a fragment that contains the OLE1 5′-UTR, the N-terminal part of OLE1 protein-coding sequence linked to FAH1 TM1, and part of the OLE1 sequence between the TM loops was amplified with primers prMV043 and prMV051 from plasmid pMV056. In a separate reaction, a fragment containing the remaining elements of the OLE1 intermembrane loop sequences, FAH1 TM2, the C-terminal part of the OLE1 protein coding sequence, and the OLE1 3′-UTR was amplified using primers prMV052 and prMV048 from plasmid pMV055. The two fragments were then fused by the SOE technique, digested with restriction enzymes XbaI/HindIII, and inserted into the same sites in plasmid pGAL-OLE-207 to create pGAL-OLE-FAHtm1&2. Deletion of Sequences from the Start Codon to the Beginning of Transmembrane Loop 1 (Plasmid pMV088)—The OLE1 5′-UTR (220 bp) was amplified by PCR using primers prMV043 and prMV133 from plasmid pGAL-OLE2.8. In a second reaction the OLE1-coding sequence beyond the start of TM regions (+301 bp) and OLE1 3′-UTR (1 kb) was amplified using primers prMV132 and prMV048 from plasmid pMV071. Both PCR products were spliced by SOE and cloned into SrfI site in pCRScriptSK+ plasmid to produce pMV085. The XbaI/HindIII fragment (2451 bp) from plasmid pMV085 was then cloned into the same sites in pGAL-OLE-207 plasmid vector to generate pMV088. Deletion of the Protein Coding Sequence between the Transmembrane Loops of OLE1 (pMV089)—A 716-bp fragment that contains the OLE1 5′-UTR (220 bp) and protein-coding sequence to the end of OLE1 TM1 was amplified by PCR using the primers prMV043 and prMV134 from plasmid pMV071. In a second reaction, the OLE1-coding sequence that includes TM2 and 3′-UTR (1 kb) was amplified using primers prMV135 and prMV048 from plasmid pGAL-OLE2.8. The PCR products were spliced by SOE, and the resultant product was cloned into the SrfI site in pCRScriptSk+ plasmid to make pMV086. The XbaI/HindIII fragment (2453 bp) of pMV086 was then cloned into the same sites on pGAL-OLE-207 vector to generate plasmid pMV089. Deletion of Protein-coding Sequence between Transmembrane Loop 2 and PacI Site—Primers prMV043 and prMV138 were used to amplify 220 bp of OLE1 5′-UTR and 918 bp of OLE1 protein-coding sequence until the end of TM2 using plasmid pMV071 as a template. In another PCR reaction, primers prMV139 and prMV048 were used to amplify 195 bp of OLE1 protein-coding sequences starting from PacI site to the stop codon and 1 kb of 3′-UTR using plasmid p(–B)HpaI as template. The PCR products were spliced by SOE and cloned into SrfI site in pCRScriptSk+ plasmid to make pMV087. The XbaI/HindIII fragment of pMV087 (2306 bp) was then cloned into the same sites in pGAL-OLE-207 plasmid vector to generate pMV090. Substitution of Ole1p-coding Sequence from PacI Site in the Cytochrome b5-like Region to the Stop Codon with GFP Protein-coding Sequences—The GFP protein-coding sequence from plasmid GFPmut3.1 was amplified by PCR using primers prMV072 and prMV074. In a separate reaction the OLE1-coding sequence beyond the PacI site in the cytochrome b5-like region to the stop codon and OLE1 3′-UTR was amplified with primers prMV075 and prMV048 from plasmid p(–B)HpaI. The PCR products were spliced by SOE and cloned into SrfI site in pCRScriptSK+ plasmid to make PCR_GFPm (2). A PacI/HindIII fragment from plasmid PCR_GFPm (2) was ligated into same sites in plasmid pGAL-OLE2.8 to generate plasmid pGAL-OLE-GFPm (2). The OLE1 protein-coding sequence from PacI site to the stop codon was also replaced by the GFP protein-coding sequence from plasmid pGFPuv (Clontech). A 716-bp fragment containing the GFP-coding sequence was amplified from pGFPuv with primers prMV068 and prMV069. In a separate reaction the OLE1 protein-coding sequences from the PacI site to the stop codon and OLE1 3′-UTR was amplified using primers prMV070 and prMV048 from plasmid p(–B)HpaI. The two PCR products were spliced by SOE and cloned into SrfI site in plasmid pCRScriptSK+ plasmid to generate plasmid PCR_GFP1. PacI/HindIII digestion of PCR_GFP1 released a 1716-kb fragment that was then cloned into same sites on pGAL-OLE2.8 to make plasmid pGAL-OLE-GFP1. Linkage of TM1, TM2, and Cytochrome b5 Essential Elements within the OLE1 5′- and 3′-UTR Regions—The HpaI fragment of OLE1 containing the entire mRNA-encoding sequence was digested with SalI/PacI to remove elements of the OLE1 protein-coding sequence extending from the N-terminal SalI site to the PacI site within the cytochrome b5 domain. PCR-amplified fragments encoding the TM1 and TM2 regions were fused by the introduction of a SalI restriction site in the forward PCR primer and a PacI site in the reverse primer to construct vectors pGAL-OLE1-TM1-cytb5, pGAL-OLE1-TM2 cytb5, and vector pE31, which contain all three essential elements of the protein-coding sequence. Replacing the OLE1 3′-UTR with the PGK1 3′-UTR (Plasmid pGAL-OLE-PGK3′utr)—The OLE1 protein-coding sequence extending from +1 to +1387 was amplified with primers prMV005/prMV032 from pGAL-OLE2.8 and the PGK1 3′-UTR (1 kb after the stop codon) was amplified by PCR with primers prMV034/prMV035 from genomic DNA (W3031A). Each of the PCR fragments was cloned separately"

Experimental studies using animal and in vitro models indicate that condensates from asphalt fumes are genotoxic and can promote skin tumorigenesis. Enhanced activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) is frequently associated with the promotion of skin tumorigenesis. The current study investigated the effect of exposure to asphalt fumes on AP-1 activation in mouse JB6 P+ epidermal cells and the skin of transgenic mice expressing the AP-1 luciferase reporter gene. Asphalt fumes were generated from a dynamic generation system that simulated road-paving conditions. Exposure to asphalt fumes significantly increased AP-1 activity in JB6 P+ cells as well as in cultured keratinocytes isolated from transgenic mice expressing AP-1 reporter. In addition, topical application of asphalt fumes by painting the tail skin of mice increased AP-1 activity by 14-fold. Exposure to asphalt fumes promoted basal as well as epidermal growth factor-stimulated anchorage-independent growth of JB6 P+ cells in soft agar. It activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473/Thr-308, and concurrently activated downstream p70 S6 kinase as well as glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Asphalt fumes transiently activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases without affecting extracellular signal-regulated kinases and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Further study indicated that blockage of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation eliminated asphalt fume-stimulated AP-1 activation and formation of anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar. This is the first report showing that exposure to asphalt fumes can activate AP-1 and intracellular signaling that may promote skin tumorigenesis, thus providing important evidence on the potential involvement of exposure to asphalt fumes in skin carcinogenesis.

Millions of tons of asphalt are produced every year and extensively used in the paving and roofing industries (1Institute Asphalt United States asphalt usage report. Asphalt Institute, College Park, MD1989Google Scholar). It has been estimated that ∼2 million workers are exposed to asphalt fumes (1Institute Asphalt United States asphalt usage report. Asphalt Institute, College Park, MD1989Google Scholar). It was reported that road-paving workers can be exposed to 0.1–2 mg/m3 of bitumen fumes, which can include 10–200 ng/m3 benzo(a)pyrene (2Burstyn I. Kromhout H. Kauppinen T. Heikkila P. Boffetta P. Ann. Occup. Hyg. 2000; 44: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The worker exposure routes are mainly through inhalation and skin contamination. Prolonged, extensive exposure to asphalt fumes has been reported to be associated with several adverse health effects (3Lutes C.C. Thomas R.J. Burnette R. Evaluation of emission from paving asphalts. Final report to US EPA. Acurex Enviromental Corp., Research Triangle Park, NC1994Google Scholar). A major health concern from exposure to asphalt fumes is the potential exposure to carcinogens. Epidemiological studies indicate that there is an increased risk for lung, stomach, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and leukemia in the roofer population (4Brandt H. Lafontaine M. Kriech A.J. de Groot P. Bonnet P. Binet S. Wissel H. Morele Y. Nunge H. Castegnaro M. Ann. Occup. Hyg. 2000; 44: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Experimental studies using animal and in vitro models demonstrate that laboratory-generated condensates from roofing asphalt fumes are genotoxic and produce skin tumors in mice (5Machado M.L.

Exposure to several other asphalt-based paints causes the formation of DNA adducts in the skin and lung of mice as well as in human skin fibroblast (7Binet S. Pfohl-Leszkowicz A. Brandt H. Lafontaine M. Castegnaro M. Sci. Total Environ. 2002; 300: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the information regarding the potential carcinogenic effect of asphalt fumes is very limited.Chemical carcinogenesis is a complex process that can be divided experimentally into three stages: initiation, promotion, and progression. Initiation is associated with irreversible, carcinogen-mediated DNA mutation. In contrast, promotion is a reversible process in which there are increases in the rate of cell replication and/or alterations in gene expression. Progression represents the final genetic changes associated with the conversion of benign tumors into fully malignant cells. JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line (Cl 41), originally derived from primary mouse epidermal cells, offers an excellent model to investigate the molecular events that are associated with tumor promotion. These cells undergo a response analogous to second stage tumor promotion in mouse skin when treated with various tumor promoters.

The activation of AP-1 is regulated by multiple signaling pathways, including phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. A recent study indicates that AP-1 activity is also regulated by glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signaling (22Grimes C.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). These signal pathways have been shown to play a critical role in promotion of skin tumorigenesis (18Huang C. Ma W.Y.

Fujii M. Hou D.X. Int. J. Oncol. 2003; 22: 829-833PubMed Google Scholar). The current study was designed to evaluate the effect of exposure to asphalt fumes on AP-1 activity and associated intracellular signaling. Asphalt fumes were generated from a dynamic asphalt-fume generation system that simulates road-paving conditions (28Wang J. Lewis D.M. Castranova V. Frazer D.G. Goldsmith T. Tomblyn S. Simpson J. Stone S. Afshari A. Siegel P.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3691-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that exposure to asphalt fumes induces AP-1 transactivation in JB6 P+ cells as well as in skin and primary keratinocytes derived from transgenic mice expressing AP-1 reporter gene; it selectively activates PI3K/Akt and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. Furthermore, exposure to asphalt fumes promotes anchorage-independent growth in soft agar. These results provide an important insight into the potential role of exposure to asphalt fumes in tumor promotion.MATERIALS AND METHODSMaterials—Reagent grade dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 99.9+%), hexane, and perdeuterated anthracene were purchased from Aldrich. The PAH mix reference material was purchased from Supelo (Bellefonte, PA). The test asphalt was the type used by the paving industry (Hot Performance Grade Asphalt PG 64-22). The glass-fiber filters (20.3 × 25.4 cm) were purchased from Gelman Sciences (Ann Arbor, Michigan). Solid phase extraction cartridges of EnvirElut PAH (500 ng/2.8 ml) were purchased from Varian (Harbor City, CA). Poly(tetrafluoroethylene tubes (30 ml) and glass tubes (10 ml) were purchased from Fisher Scientific. Target vials (1.5 mm with 200-μl inserts) were obtained from Alltech Associates, Inc. (Deerfield, IL). Extraction of asphalt fumes from collection media was performed by ultrasonic extraction (FS-220, Ultrasonicator 320W; Fisher Scientific). Extracts were reduced under a nitrogen stream using a TurboVap LV evaporator (Zymark). High purity helium was purchased from Butler Gas Products Co. (Mckees Rocks, PA), and used as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Hewlett Packard, Wilmington, DE) carrier gas. The GC column was HP-5 MS, 95% dimethylpolysiloxane, nonpolar, 30-m length, 0.53 mm inner diameter (Hewlett Packard). All antibodies except anti-actin and anti-p110 subunit of PI3K antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-actin and anti-p110 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).Preparation of Asphalt Fume Samples—Generation of asphalt fumes was conducted in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health inhalation facility. A dynamic asphalt fume generation system was employed to provide test asphalt fumes (28Wang J. Lewis D.M. Castranova V. Frazer D.G. Goldsmith T. Tomblyn S. Simpson J. Stone S. Afshari A. Siegel P.D. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 3691-3700Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A computer control system has been designed to improve the system's performance and to simplify its operation. The test asphalt is representative of the type used by the paving industry throughout the midwestern United States. The asphalt fumes were generated at 150 °C, and collected on glass-fiber filters. The fumes sample preparation involved desorption, filtration, and preconcentration. In the experiment, the asphalt fumes collected on filter were transferred to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) tube, and dichloromethane/hexane (50/50) was added. Ultrasonic extraction was performed using an FS-220 Ultrasonicator (320W). After desorption of asphalt fumes from the collection medium, the extract was filtered. Preconcentration was performed under nitrogen using TurboVap LV Evaporator. Sample extracts were reconstituted with dichloromethane.Culture and Treatment of Mouse Epidermal Cell Lines—JB6 P+ mouse epidermal cell line (Cl 41) were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The stable transfectants of Cl 41 cells expressing AP-1-luciferase reporter (Cl 41 AP-1) and dominant-negative PI3K regulatory p85 subunit (JB6DNp85) have been described previously (24Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to asphalt fumes (10–320 μg/ml) for specified periods. For blocking intracellular kinase activity, cells were treated with either PI3K inhibitor (10 μm LY294002 or 100 nm wortmannin; Sigma), GSK-3β inhibitor (10 μm 4-benzyl-2-methyl-1,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione; Calbiochem), or JNK inhibitor (1 μm d-JNKI; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) 30 min before exposure to asphalt fumes.AP-1-luciferase Reporter Transgenic Mice and Keratinocyte Culture—2X TRE-luciferase reporter transgenic mice were originally established by Rincon and Flavell (29Rincon M. Flavell R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4370-4381Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A C57BL/6 male mouse carrying the 2X TRE-luciferase transgene was crossed with DBA/2 female mice (SASCO, Omaha, NE) (18Huang C. Ma W.Y. Dawson M.I. Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The F1 offspring were screened by testing both the basal and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate-induced levels of luciferase activity for the presence of the AP-1-luciferase reporter gene. Mice were housed under temperature-, humidity-, and light-controlled conditiona. Food and water were available ad libitum.Primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from the epidermis of newborn AP-1 transgenic mice by a method described previously (30Hakkinen L. Koivisto L. Larjava H. Methods Cell Sci. 2001; 23: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 31Hodivala-Dilke K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 188: 139-144PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the trunk skin of newborn mice was floated dermis side down on 0.25% trypsin/EDTA in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution overnight at 4 °C, and the epidermal layer was separated. The epidermis was minced in keratinocyte essential medium (Sigma), and then the cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer to remove the stratum corneum. Keratinocytes were collected by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min) and seeded into fibronectin/collagen-coated dishes. Cells were maintained in a keratinocyte growth medium (Sigma) for 4 h with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Unattached cells were removed by a gentle wash with warm keratinocyte growth medium. Adhesive keratinocytes were cultured in this medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.Measurement of AP-1 Activity—AP-1 transactivation in JB6 P+ epidermal cells was determined by assaying the activity of the luciferase reporter (24Huang C. Ma W.Y. Young M.R. Colburn N. Dong Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 156-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in 96-well plates and grown in a medium containing 10% FBS. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For assaying AP-1 activity, subconfluent cultures were maintained in a medium containing 0.1% FBS for 24 h and subsequently treated with asphalt fumes with or without protein kinase inhibitors for specified durations. After treatment, cellular protein was extracted with a 1× lysis buffer supplied in the luciferase assay kit (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured with a Monolight luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, Sparks, MD). AP-1 activity (luciferase activity) was calculated and expressed relative to the untreated cultures. AP-1 activity was also measured in purified primary keratinocytes and the skin of transgenic mice expressing AP-1 luciferase reporter gene. Primary epidermal keratinocytes were exposed to asphalt fumes (10 μg) for 6 h, and AP-1 activity was determined. For assay of AP-1 activity in mouse skin, a small piece of tail skin (2 mm2) was removed either before or after asphalt painting, and cellular protein was extracted with a 2× lysis buffer, then luciferase activity was assayed as above.MTT Assay—The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was employed to determine the number of viable cells in culture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) (32Sun Y. Lin H. Zhu Y. Ma C. Ye J. Luo J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the cleavage of the yellow tetrazolium salt MTT to purple formazan crystals by metabolically active cells. Briefly, the cells were plated into 96-well microtiter plates and exposed to either asphalt fumes (10–320 μg/ml) or Me2SO (control) for 48 h. After exposure to asphalt fumes, 10 μl of MTT labeling reagent were added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The cultures were then solubilized, and spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was detected by a microtiter plate reader. The wavelength to measure absorbance of formazan product is 570 nm, with a reference wavelength of 750 nm.PI3K Activity—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the plates, and centrifuged at 4000 cpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was incubated for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm aprotinin, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. PI3K was immunoprecipitated using a method described previously (33Luo J. Miller M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10014-10025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μg of total protein was incubated with 20 μl of protein A/G plus agarose for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by spinning at 3000 cpm for 3 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μl of antibody directed against p110 subunit of PI3K (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads (30 μl) were added for an additional 1 h. The beads were then pelleted and washed sequentially, five times, with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and once with 20 mm HEPES. PI3K activity assay was performed using phosphatidylinositol as substrate in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl, 2 μCi of [γ32P]ATP, 60 μm ATP, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol. Reaction was carried out for 15 min at room temperature and extracted by the addition of 80 μl of 1 m HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After centrifugation at 3000 cpm for 2 min, the organic phase (bottom layer) was collected and dried in with a vacuum drier (SpeedVac, Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY). The samples were dissolved in 10 μl of chloroform and separated on a thin layer chromatography plate. Incorporation of 32P into phosphorylated lipids was detected by autoradiography for 1–2 days.Immunoblotting—The immunoblotting procedure for detecting phosphorylation and expression of signal proteins was performed as described previously (33Luo J. Miller M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10014-10025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for 10 min, solubilized cells were centrifuged, the supernatant was collected, and the protein concentration was determined. Aliquots of the protein (40 μg) were loaded onto the lanes of an SDS 10.0% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were separated by electrophoresis, and the separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with either 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% bovine serum albumin (for detection of phosphorylation) in 0.010 m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h to block nonspecific immunoreactivity. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies directed against signal proteins for 1.5 h at room temperature. After two quick washes in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) diluted at 1:2000 in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The immune complexes were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases, the blots were stripped and re-probed with an anti-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Anchorage-independent Growth—The cell growth matrix consists of two layers of basal medium Eagle agar in 6-well culture trays. The base layer (2 ml) contained 10% FBS and 0.5% basal medium Eagle agar. The top layer (0.5 ml) contained 10% FBS, 0.33% basal medium Eagle agar, and JB6 P+ or JB6DNp85 cell suspension (0.5 × 104). EGF (30 ng/ml) and asphalt fumes (10 ng/ml) were applied in both the top and bottom layers. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C with an atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 14 days, and the number of induced cell colonies was counted under a microscope. Colonies, which contain 8 or more cells, were counted in four 0.5-cm2 areas randomly chosen with respect to distance from the center of the well, and the count was multiplied by the appropriate factor to give the colony number/well.Statistical Analysis—Differences among treatment groups were tested using an analysis of variance. Differences in which p was less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. In cases where significant differences were detected, specific post hoc comparisons between treatment groups were examined with Student-Newman-Keuls tests.RESULTSDetermination of Asphalt Fume Concentration—The concentration of asphalt fumes was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with positive electron ionization. The instrument was calibrated with the use of a mixture of 16 reference PAHs, and perdeuterium anthracene was used as internal standard. The total ion chromatograms were acquired with a 3-min solvent delay. Separation was performed on a HP-5 MSD capillary column (30-m length, 0.53 mm inner diameter) with a temperature program from 50–310 °C at an increasing rate of 5 °C/min. Calibration curves were developed with five-point measurements. The recovery of the asphalt fumes were evaluated by adding stable isotope perdeuterated anthracene in the samples and determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The analytical results were recorded as profiles of total ion chromatogram over specific ranges of mass-to-charge ratios. A typical total ion chromatogram acquired is displayed in Fig. 1A. The major components were observed over a range of molecular size of m/z 51–365 (Fig. 1, B and C), and eluted from capillary column at retention times of 13–52 min. The relative recovery of the internal standard can account for losses of the analytes during sample preparation and detection. The total asphalt fume concentration was determined and diluted to 41.41 mg/ml with Me2SO for cell exposure. In some cases, asphalt fumes were dissolved in ethanol for comparison.Exposure to Asphalt Fumes Activates AP-1—MTT assay was performed to determine whether asphalt fumes, at a pharmacologically relevant concentration range, affect cell viability. As shown in Fig. 2, at the concentration less than 40 μg/ml, asphalt fumes did not significantly affect the viability of JB6 P+ cells; however, at high concentrations (>40 μg/ml), asphalt fumes caused cell death regardless of serum concentration in the culture medium. In all the subsequent studies, therefore, a non-toxic concentration of asphalt fumes (20 μg/ml) was used. Exposure to asphalt fumes significantly stimulated AP-1 activity in JB6 P+ cells, and maximal activation occurred at 12 to 24 h after treatment with asphalt fumes (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, exposure to asphalt fumes dramatically increased AP-1 activity in the skin and purified keratinocytes of transgenic mice expressing AP-1 reporter gene (Fig. 3B).Fig. 2Effect of asphalt fumes on the viability of JB6 P+ cells. Cells were grown in either serum-free medium or medium containing 10% serum and exposed to asphalt fumes (AF; 0–320 μg/ml) dissolved in Me2SO for 48 h. The controls were exposed to Me2SO.

https://openalex.org/W1972249506,"We examined capacitative calcium entry (CCE) in Jurkat and in L6 skeletal muscle cells. We found that extracellular Ca2+ can enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of both cell types even in the presence of thapsigargin, which blocks entry into the ER from the cytosol through the CaATPase. Moreover, extracellular Ca2+ entry into the ER was evident even when intracellular flow of Ca2+ was in the direction of ER to cytosol due to the presence of caffeine. ER Ca2+ content was assessed by two separate means. First, we used the Mag-Fura fluorescent dye, which is sensitive only to the relatively high concentrations of Ca2+ found in the ER. Second, we transiently expressed an ER-targeted derivative of aequorin, which reports Ca2+ by luminescence. In both cases, the Ca2+ concentration in the ER increased in response to extracellular Ca2+ after the ER had been previously depleted despite blockade by thapsigargin. We found two differences between the Jurkat and L6 cells. L6, but not Jurkat cells, inhibited Ca2+ uptake at very high Ca2+ concentrations. Second, ryanodine receptor blockers inhibited the appearance of cytosolic Ca2+ during CCE if added before Ca2+ in both cases, but the L6 cells were much more sensitive to ryanodine. Both of these can be explained by the known difference in ryanodine receptors between these cell types. These findings imply that the origin of cytosolic Ca2+ during CCE is the ER. Furthermore, kinetic data demonstrated that Ca2+ filled the ER before the cytosol during CCE. Our results suggest a plasma membrane Ca2+ channel and an ER Ca2+ channel joined in tandem, allowing Ca2+ to flow directly from the extracellular space to the ER. This explains CCE; any decrease in ER [Ca2+] relative to extracellular [Ca2+] would provide the gradient for refilling the ER through a mass-action mechanism.

Ca2+ is a critical regulator for a large number of cells, and it is known that for many, the key signaling event is the release of this ion from the ER 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum (also used in this work for muscle endoplasmic reticulum, often called sarcoplasmic reticulum); CCE, capacitative calcium entry; Tg, thapsigargin; Ry, ryanodine; RyR, Ry receptor (Ca2+ channel) and subtypes RyR1 and RyR3; Mag-Fura, MagFura 2-AM (acetoxymethyl); DHBP, 1,1-diheptyl-4,4-bipyridiniumdibromide; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum (also used in this work for muscle endoplasmic reticulum, often called sarcoplasmic reticulum); CCE, capacitative calcium entry; Tg, thapsigargin; Ry, ryanodine; RyR, Ry receptor (Ca2+ channel) and subtypes RyR1 and RyR3; Mag-Fura, MagFura 2-AM (acetoxymethyl); DHBP, 1,1-diheptyl-4,4-bipyridiniumdibromide; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate.

Sci. 1998; 23: 10-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). After release most of the Ca2+ is re-sequestered to the ER through the CaATPase, although some is lost through the plasma membrane to the cell exterior. Maintaining the ER pool of Ca2+ requires re-entry from outside the cell. Casteels and Droogmans (3Casteels R. Droogmans G. J. Physiol. 1981; 317: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) first reported a correlation between depletion of ER [Ca2+] and entry of Ca2+ from extracellular sources into the cell. This phenomenon was then extensively studied by Putney (4Putney J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar) and named “store-operated” or capacitative calcium entry (CCE).The mechanism for CCE remains unknown, although two general models have been proposed. One, borrowed from the known association of the skeletal muscle plasma membrane potential sensor (L channel) and ER protein (ryanodine receptor), posits a direct connection in which Ca2+ depletion within the ER is sensed by an ER protein, transmitted by protein-protein interaction to the plasma membrane protein, which then allows entry of Ca2+ into the cytosol. A second, based on second messenger signaling systems such as that for cyclic AMP, posits a messenger generated within the ER subsequent to Ca2+ depletion that diffuses to the plasma membrane and allows entry of Ca2+ into the cytosol (5Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 6Putney J.W. Broad L.M. Braun F.J. Lievremont J.P. Bird G.S.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2223-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).When Ca2+ uptake was originally studied it appeared that Ca2+ did not change in concentration in the cytosol (7Putney J.W. Putney J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, Texas1997Crossref Google Scholar), and a direct entry from the extracellular space into the ER was postulated. The discovery of selective inhibitors of the CaATPase (e.g. thapsigargin) changed that view; in the presence of such agents, adding exogenous Ca2+ to Ca2+-free cells leads to an accumulation of cytosolic Ca2+ (8Jackson T.R. Paterson S.I. Thastrup O Hanley M.R. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as proving that Ca2+ enters cells through the cytosol, is blocked from entry into the ER, and accumulates in the cytosol. Almost all of the CCE studies rely on monitoring only changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels. Although measuring cytosolic Ca2+ levels afford valuable insights into the phenomenon of CCE, this by design remains an indirect way of assessing ER Ca2+ changes.Most CCE studies were conducted with non-excitable cells; however, there now exists evidence that this restriction need not apply. We had previously shown that CCE occurs in L6 skeletal muscle cells (11Wingertzahn M.A. Ochs R.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 221: 234-241PubMed Google Scholar), and others demonstrated subsequently that CCE occurs in skeletal muscle (12Hopf F.W. Reddy P. Hong J. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22358-22367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 13Kurebayashi N. Ogawa Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 553: 185-199Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In our prior studies of L6 cells, we determined Ca2+ in both cytosol and ER using fluorescent dyes, finding that Ca2+ enters the ER even in the presence of thapsigargin (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In the present study, we explored this hypothesis for Jurkat cells, a well studied non-excitable cell line. Our previous work used direct measurement of the ER space of the L6 myotube using the calcium indicator Mag-Fura. This compound has been used for this purpose in the past, and our findings were consistent with measurement of the ER pool (15Sugiyama T. Goldman W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C698-C705Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is known that, once Mag-Fura is added to cells (as the acetoxy ester) it appears in all three significant Ca2+ pools; that is, the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the ER. Given that the Mag-Fura dissociation constant (53 μm) is far above the Ca2+ concentrations in the first two compartments, it is unlikely that they contribute significantly to the signal. Still, earlier investigators suggested cytosolic Ca2+ and Mg2+ signals may be sensed by Mag-Fura (16Ogden D. Khodakhah K. Carter T. Thomas M. Capiod T. Pflügers Arch. 1995; 429: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Lennard R. Singh J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).Therefore, we sought to investigate the question of whether Mag-Fura faithfully reports the ER space by an entirely separate measurement system, expression of an aequorin protein. This photo-protein selectively binds to Ca2+ and can be synthesized with a leader sequence targeted to the ER exclusively and modified so that its binding constant is much higher than cytosol or mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations (18Robert V. De Giorgi F. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30372-30378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We also examined Mag-Fura-loaded cells by fluorescence microscopy to determine whether Ca2+ accumulated in vesicles (presumably ER) or was diffuse (presumably cytosolic). Finally, we conducted additional experiments to probe the model for direct Ca2+ entry into the ER. Our findings support the idea that Mag-Fura specifically reports ER Ca2+ and also support the model suggesting that Ca2+ entry to the ER does not involve the cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsJurkat cells (E6–1 clone from humans) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The subclone of the rat myogenic cell line L6 used in this study was a generous gift from Dr. K. M. Ojamaa (North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY). The calcium fluorescent indicator Mag-Fura, the plasmid encoding apoaequorin pSVAEQERK, and coelenterazine-n (a luciferin) were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The Wizard Maxi and Mini Preps for plasmid amplification were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The cytosolic dye Indo PE3 (AM) was purchased from TefLabs (Austin, TX). 1,1-Diheptyl-4,4-bipyridiniumdibromide (DHBP) was obtained from Tocris-Cookson. The transfection reagent FuGENE 6 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The restriction enzymes SalI and EcoRI were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). ACLAR™ electron microscopy embedding film was obtained from Ted Pella Inc. (Redding CA). All cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The other chemicals and reagents used in this study were obtained from Sigma.MethodsCell Culture—Jurkat cells were grown on RPMI 1640 medium supplemented by 10% fetal calf serum. Media was changed every 48 h, and cells were used when they attained a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml. L6 cells were grown as described previously (11Wingertzahn M.A. Ochs R.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 221: 234-241PubMed Google Scholar).Fluorescent Measurements—Measurement of cytosolic Ca2+ was performed as reported previously using Indo PE3 (AM) dye (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For measurement of the ER Ca2+ of Jurkat cells, the cells were loaded with 8–10 μm concentrations of the dye Mag-Fura in Hanks' balanced salt solution. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C at 5% CO2 tension. After this, the mixture was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were resuspended in fresh Hanks' balanced salt solution for 1.5 h to allow de-esterification of the dye.L6 cells were loaded with 8–10 μm concentrations of the dye Mag-Fura in phosphate-buffered saline. The loading time was 1 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, after which cells were washed with Hank's balanced salt solution. The cells were incubated further for 1.5 h to allow de-esterification of the dye. For both L6 and Jurkat cells, saponin (1 mg/ml) did not show an increase in the fluorescence ratio (347/373), but subsequent treatment with Triton X-100 (0.1%) did show an increase in this ratio, indicating ER localization of the dye (21Golovina V.A. Blaustein M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar).After dye loading, L6 cells were placed in a quartz cuvette at a 45° angle to both the excitation and emission beams of a Hitachi F2000 Fluorometer in 1.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 118 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The fluorescence measurements used excitation wavelengths of 347 and 373 nm and emission at 507 nm (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The ratio of the bound to unbound dye with a dissociation constant of 53 μm for Mag-Fura was used to calculate the free ER [Ca2+] as described by Grynkiewicz (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Maximum and minimum fluorescence was measured at the end of each experiment by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EGTA, respectively.Microscopy—L6 cells, grown on glass slides, were loaded as above with Mag-Fura, a drop of 10% glycerol in 0.9% saline was added, and a coverslip was placed on top. Epifluorescence was measured with an Olympus microscope with fluorescent attachment and a blue excitation filter. Exposures were made from an attached Nikon camera.Aequorin Plasmid Amplification and Transfection of Jurkat Cells— Competent Escherichia coli cells were transformed with 25 ng/μl aequorin plasmid pSVAEQERK and amplified, and the presence of plasmid was confirmed with the restriction enzymes SalI and EcoRI. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 75-cm2 Falcon flasks. Approximately 5 × 106 cells were transferred into each well in a 6-well plate and transfected with FuGENE 6, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 3 μl of FuGENE 6 was diluted to 100 μl in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and 2 μg of DNA was added. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature, this mixture was added to the cells. After 24 h, the cells were used for calcium measurement.Reconstitution of Aequorin—To obtain an initially low [Ca2+] in the lumen of the ER, cells were treated for 2 min in Ca2+-free medium (125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4) containing in addition 10 mm caffeine, 3 mm EGTA and 30 μm tBuBHQ (2,5-di(terbutyl)-1,4-benzohydroquinone) (17Lennard R. Singh J. Gen. Pharmacol. 1992; 23: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Robert V. De Giorgi F. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30372-30378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It is important to lower the [Ca2+] in the ER before reconstitution since the presence of Ca2+ will cause the reconstituted aequorin to decompose to apoaequorin, coelenteramide, and CO2. After washing with the Ca2+-free medium, 5 μm coelenterazine-n was added, and incubation was continued for 2 h at 37 °C (18Robert V. De Giorgi F. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Pozzan T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30372-30378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cells were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 3 min and resuspended in Ca2+-free media. The aequorin light emission was measured with a Zylox luminometer. At the end of each experiment, the total light units from the unconsumed aequorin was estimated by permeabilizing the cells with 0.5% Triton X-100 in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 (19Montero M.

The [Ca2+] was calculated from the value of –log(L/L max), where L is the rate of luminescence (in arbitrary units), and L max is the rate of luminescence remaining in the sample. This value is proportional to the pCa (18Robert V. De Giorgi F. Massimino M.L. Cantini M. Pozzan T. J. Biol.

Data are represented as the means ± S.E., and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSBecause the phenomenon of CCE by definition involves replenishing the ER Ca2+ stores, we measured ER as well as cytosolic Ca2+ levels in the Jurkat cells. Fig. 1 shows that thapsigargin (Tg) increased cytosolic Ca2+ in Jurkat cells suspended in a Ca2+-free medium. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ caused a greater increase in cytosolic Ca2+, as expected. However, as shown in Fig. 1a, this increase was sensitive to inhibition by ryanodine (Ry). As shown in Fig. 1b, ryanodine did not cause inhibition when exogenous Ca2+ was added before Ry. Thus, as we observed previously with L6 muscle cells (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), ryanodine blocked an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+], the current hallmark of CCE, but only if added before exogenous Ca2+. Because ryanodine blocks the ER Ca2+ release channels (the ryanodine receptor, or RyR), the results imply that the origin of cytosolic Ca2+ during CCE may be the ER rather than the extracellular space, which is usually assumed.DHBP, another blocker of the RyR (25Kang J.J. Hsu K.S. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 1216-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Nguyen H.N. Wang C. Perry D.C. Brain Res. 2002; 924: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), was able to inhibit the Tg-induced rise in cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2). DHBP also blunted CCE, as measured by the cytosolic Ca2+ increase subsequent to exogenous Ca2+ addition. Unlike the effect of Ry (which appeared to act as a competitive inhibitor), DHBP action was unaltered when added before or after the addition of Ca2+ to the media. The blockade of CCE by two kinetically distinct compounds that both target the RyR firmly supports the notion that the origin of the cytosolic Ca2+ under these conditions is the ER. We next conducted more direct measurements of ER [Ca2+] levels.Fig. 2Effect of DHBP on CCE. DHBP, an inhibitor of ryanodine receptor, blocked the elevation of Ca2+ that normally appears subsequent to the addition of thapsigargin, the CaATPase inhibitor. The cytosolic Ca2+ was measured with Indo PE3. A, control, showing sequential response to TG and Ca2+. B, subsequent effect of DHBP, demonstrating its ability to lower Ca2+ concentrations. C, DHPB added before endogenous Ca2+. This caused an inhibition of both the Tg elevation as well as the subsequent response to added Ca2+. Traces are representative of more than five separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Direct Analysis of ER Ca2 + by Fluorescent Chelator— Fig. 3, a tracing of raw data, shows that after Tg addition, both 0.5 and 1 mm exogenous Ca2+ increased ER [Ca2+]. Subsequent addition of caffeine, known to release Ca2+ from the ER, decreased the ER [Ca2+]. A titration of ER [Ca2+] response to a wide range of exogenously added Ca2+ concentrations is shown in Fig. 4. It is apparent that ER Ca2+ concentrations increased over the physiological range of exogenous Ca2+ and was saturated at about 2 mm. We also found that exogenous Ca2+ increased the ER Ca2+ content in the presence of both caffeine and Tg, as shown in Fig. 5. Because ER [Ca2+] was lowered in the presence of caffeine and net flux was very likely to be in the direction of ER to cytosol, this result indicates ER [Ca2+] filling occurred directly from the extracellular space.Fig. 3Direct uptake of Ca2+ into the ER of Jurkat cells. The trace is representative of more than five separate experiments with Mag-Fura-loaded cells and typifies the raw data that was extracted for the remaining figures. Addition artifacts were removed from the traces. Tg was added at 2 μm as in Fig. 1, and different levels of Ca2+ addition and caffeine addition (Caff) are shown in mm units. Exogenous Ca2+ elevated the measured fluorescence ratio; caffeine lowered it. The release of cell Ca2+ by Triton X-100 (0.1%) and its chelation by EGTA (5 mm) were made to demonstrate the expected alterations in Ca2+ and to allow estimation of free Ca2+ levels as described “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Titration of ER Ca2+ as a function of added Ca2+ in Jurkat cells. ER Ca2+ was measured as in Fig. 3. Tg (used throughout as in Fig. 1) was present in all incubations shown. Means are plotted, and S.E. is indicated for n = 4. No product inhibition by Ca2+ was evident.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Effect of caffeine on entry of Ca2+ into ER in Jurkat Cells. Conditions were similar to Fig. 4 except that 10 mm caffeine (Caff) was also present to partially deplete Ca2+. Because Tg was also present, conditions were established to force a net release of Ca2+ from ER to the cytosol. Nonetheless, under these conditions, Ca2+ still accumulated (although in less magnitude to Fig. 4) in the ER when added exogenously. Data are represented as means, and S.E. are indicated, n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Analysis of ER Ca2 + by Transfection of a Modified Aequorin—To confirm the observations made with Mag-Fura, we sought to measure ER Ca2+ by an alternative method. We used the technique of transfection of the photo-protein aequorin that has been modified to achieve selectivity for ER Ca2+ in two ways (19Montero M. Brini M. Marsault R. Alvarez J. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 20Barrero M.J. Montero M. Alvarez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27694-27699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). First, it has a leader sequence that targets the expressed protein into the ER. Second, the Ca2+ binding site of the protein has been modified so that its affinity for Ca2+ is much less than aequorin itself and is suitable for binding Ca2+ in the ER space. The cofactor coelenterazine is also modified to provide a system for reporting Ca2+ specific to the ER, with a dissociation constant (about 15 μm) that would render it insensitive to Ca2+ concentration of other cellular pools.Fig. 6 shows the luminescence of cells that have transiently expressed aequorin compared with controls. It is clear that transfected cells had considerable base-line Ca2+ and that more was apparent when Ca2+ was added. This indicates the technique can measure intracellular Ca2+ pools that have a low Ca2+ affinity, comparable with the Mag-Fura dye. Fig. 7 shows that the increase in Ca2+, which we attribute to ER based upon the two considerations above, occurred over the same range of externally added Ca2+ as that indicated by the Mag-Fura dye (cf. Fig. 4). Although the calculated values of ER [Ca2+] were somewhat greater (30%) with the aequorin method, it is not a large difference considering uncertainties in the binding constants required for calculation of the free [Ca2+].Fig. 6Transfection of Jurkat cells by aequorin. Transfection of Jurkat cells (gray bars) was demonstrated by light emission both in base-line conditions and especially when 2 mm exogenous Ca2+ was present. When membranes were ruptured with Triton X-100 (0.5%) and very high Ca2+ was added, maximum levels of Ca2+ were obtained. Black bars show the results of cells that were not transfected. Details of plasmid preparation and transfection are under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Titration of ER Ca2+ as a function of added Ca2+ in Jurkat cells using aequorin transfection. Cells transfected as in Fig. 6 were titrated with exogenous Ca2+ in a manner parallel to the dye method of Fig. 4. As in the previous figure, 2 mm Ca2+ saturated the ER Ca2+ pool. Data are shown as means; S.E. are indicated as error bars, n = 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Lanthanum Blocked the Increase in ER [Ca2 + ] Measured by Both Methods—As a further control, we studied the effect of lanthanum, a known inhibitor of Ca2+ uptake by virtually any pathway into the cell, on the appearance of ER Ca2+ by both the Mag-Fura (Fig. 8a) as well as the aequorin (Fig. 8b) methods. In both cases the increase in ER [Ca2+] that occurred in the presence of Tg was completely suppressed by lanthanum. This ruled out the trivial possibility that either dye or protein had leaked to any appreciable extent into the medium, indicating the measurements reflect an intracellular Ca2+ pool at concentrations of about 2 orders of magnitude greater than cytosolic or mitochondrial pools.Fig. 8Effects of lanthanum ion on ER Ca2+ uptake measured by two separate techniques. All incubations except for the base-line control shown in a had Tg present. Tg did not alter the Ca2+ content in the conditions of b either (data not shown). Ca2+ additions are indicated in mm units and shown to increase the ER [Ca2+] by the Mag-Fura method (a) as well as the aequorin-transfected cells (b). In both cases it is apparent that La3+ (2 mm) completely suppressed the ability of Ca2+ to enter the cells, precluding the trivial possibility of dye or protein leakage from the cells and indicated a blockade of a Ca2+ transporter. Statistical differences were analyzed by analysis of variance; increases in Ca2+ were statistically significant (p < 0.05) *, versus Tg; **, versus Tg + Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Complementary Results with L6 Cells—We have recently shown that Ca2+ in the SR of the L6 muscle cells increases with increasing exogenous Ca2+, but the titration appeared qualitatively different from the one we observed in the present study with Jurkat cells; there was considerable inhibition of Ca2+ content as Ca2+ was added at concentrations greater than 3 mm (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We, therefore, transfected L6 cells with aequorin using methods similar to those used for Jurkat cells and titrated the cells with exogenous Ca2+. The results are shown in Fig. 9. As with the previous findings with Mag-Fura (14Islam M.N. Narayanan B. Ochs R.S. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 425-431Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), cells transiently expressing the aequorin protein in the ER showed substantial inhibition of Ca2+ uptake to the ER when exogenous Ca2+ was added in concentrations greater than 3 mm."
https://openalex.org/W2041920077,"BOB.1/OBF.1 is a lymphocyte-restricted transcriptional coactivator. It binds to the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors and increases their transactivation potential. Targeted gene disruption experiments revealed that BOB.1/OBF.1 is critical at different stages of B cell development. A large number of genes expressed in B cells contain octamer motifs in their regulatory regions. However, only few genes have been described so far whose expression is dependent on BOB.1/OBF.1. To understand the molecular basis of BOB.1/OBF.1 function in B cell development, we searched for BOB.1/OBF.1 target genes by expression profiling. We have identified genes both induced and repressed by BOB.1/OBF.1. Using different genetic systems, we demonstrate regulation of a selection of these genes. Identified targets included genes encoding Ahd2-like, AKR1C13, Rbp1, Sdh, Idh2, protocadherin γ, α-catenin, Ptprs, Id3, and Creg. Classification of BOB.1/OBF.1 target genes by function suggests that they affect various aspects of B cell physiology such as cellular metabolism, cell adhesion, and differentiation. To better understand the mechanism of BOB.1/OBF.1 action, we cloned the promoter of the gene encoding Ahd2-like, the gene showing the strongest regulation by BOB.1/OBF.1. This promoter indeed contains a perfect octamer motif. Furthermore, the motif was recognized by the Oct transcription factors as well as BOB.1/OBF.1 in vitro and in vivo, as shown by electromobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transient transfections confirm that this promoter is activated by BOB.1/OBF.1. Our observations suggest that by regulating genes in different functional pathways, BOB.1/OBF.1 has a widespread effect on B cell development and function."

We find that the large subunit of RF-C (RF-Cp145) is phosphorylated in vivo whereas the smaller RF-C subunits are not phosphorylated.

In mammalian cells, cyclin E-dependent kinase is activated at the G1 to S phase transition, after the D-type cyclins but prior to A-type cyclins. The timing of activation of cyclin A kinase activity coincides with the onset of DNA synthesis (1Pines J. Hunter T. Nature. 1990; 346: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Cdc2-cyclin B kinase activation at the G2/M transition is required for cells to enter mitosis. Replication of DNA is a highly regulated process, which occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. The DNA polymerase α-primase complex allows the generation of RNA-DNA primers for initiation of leading strand synthesis and synthesis of each Okazaki fragment during lagging strand replication. The polymerase switch from DNA polymerase α to DNA polymerase δ then catalyzes the replication of the leading strand and for completion of the lagging strand. The replication factor C (RF-C) complex and PCNA are essential for processive DNA synthesis. RF-C loads PCNA onto DNA in an ATP-dependent process (2Stillman B.

The Escherichia coli clamp loader, the γ complex, like the yeast and human RF-C complexes is comprised of five polypeptides. The DNA-dependent ATPase activity of the clamp in the γ complex is provided by three copies of the γ polypeptide whereas human (and yeast) utilize three different polypeptide chains hRF-Cp37 (yRF-C2), hRF-Cp36 (yRF-C3), and hRFCp40 (yRF-C4). The δ subunit (homologous to yRF-C1 in yeast and hRF-Cp145 in man) binds the clamp and has conserved hydrophobic residues required for clamp loading. Structural studies of the γ complex: δ′-γ1-γ2-γ3-δ reveals that the C-terminal domains of δ′, γ, and δ form a helical scaffold (circular collar) and the N-terminal ends appear to dangle under the C-terminal pentamer umbrella (17Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In this study we show that the RF-Cp145 is a target of CDKs in vivo. The other subunits in the RF-C complex are not targets of CDKs. Phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 increases as cells traverse S phase, peaking in G2/M. Treatment of cells with roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cdk-cyclin kinases, inhibits RFCp145 phosphorylation in G2/M. This report demonstrates that RF-C complex is phosphorylated during cell cycle by cdk-cyclin kinases and reveals a unique function of RF-Cp145 phosphorylation in human cells. Cell Cycle Synchronization—HeLa cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block. HeLa cells (1 × 106 cells/10 cm2 dish) were grown overnight in DMEM plus 10% bovine serum (Invitrogen). Thymidine (Sigma, final concentration 2 mm) was added to the medium and culture continued for 18 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and transferred to regular medium for 8 h, followed by readdition of 2 mm thymidine to the medium for 18 h. Finally cells were washed and released from the block and synchronous cell cycle progression monitored by analyzing DNA content (propidium iodide) and MPM-2 positivity by flow cytometry. In Vivo Labeling—HeLa cells collected at indicated times after release from a double thymidine block were washed with Hepes-buffered saline (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm sodium chloride) and grown in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% dialyzed bovine serum for 60 min, to deplete intracellular phosphate. The medium was aspirated and replaced with phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.5–1.0 mCi/ml inorganic [32P]orthophosphoric acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, cat. no. NEX053) for 2 h. Finally, the cells were harvested by scraping and sequential extraction on ice in 1 ml each of low-salt (10 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA) and high salt (50 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 500 mm NaCl) lysis buffers to obtain chromatin-bound fractions of RF-C. Each lysis buffer was supplemented with protease (soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase (5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) inhibitors. In some experiments cells were lyzed directly in high salt buffer. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants of the high salt extractions were used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of Endogenous RF-C Subunits and Immunoblots—Polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for RF-Cp145 (large subunit of RF-C) were generated by immunizing rabbits with recombinant protein spanning amino acid residues 369–480 of RF-Cp145. The sera were preadsorbed to GST beads and then affinity-purified on agarose affinity matrices covalently linked with RF-Cp145 domain A (369–480) recombinant protein. The anti-RF-Cp37 and anti-RF-Cp40 antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. J. Hurwitz, the anti-RF-Cp145 specific monoclonal antibodies were provided by Dr. B. Stillman and the PCNA-specific antibodies (PC10) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies used for immunoprecipitation included anti-RF-Cp145, 4 μl; anti-RF-Cp37, 1 μl, and anti-RF-Cp40, 1 μl. Immunoprecipitation was performed by mixing lysate from 1–2 × 106 cell equivalents (in ∼1-ml volume) with the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C on a nutator. The immune complexes were isolated by incubation with 30–40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by five washes in cold TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA). Finally, the immune complexes were boiled in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8.5% gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by autoradiography or immunoblot analysis. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked with 5% nonfat milk/TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody using the following dilutions: anti-RF-Cp145, 1:3000; anti-RF-Cp37, 1:2000; anti-RF-Cp40, 1:2000; anti-PCNA, 1 μg/ml. After overnight at 4 °C, membrane was washed and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Purified RF-C Complex and in Vitro Kinase Assays—Recombinant RF-C complex was purified from insect cells as described previously (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All kinase assays were performed in 18 μl of kinase reaction mixture containing 40 mm Hepes, 8 mm MgCl2, 166 mm ATP, 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and pre-activated cdk-cyclin kinases as described earlier (18Fotedar R. Fitzgerald P. Rousselle T. Cannella D. Doree M. Messier H. Fotedar A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2155-2164PubMed Google Scholar) for 20 min at 25 °C unless otherwise indicated. Sucrose Gradients—Asynchronous HeLa cell cultures were labeled in phosphate-free DMEM containing 0.5–1.0 mCi/ml inorganic [32P]orthophosphoric acid for 2 h as described above. Cells were harvested by scraping and sequentially extracted on ice in 1 ml each of low salt (10 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA) and high salt (50 mm Hepes, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm DTT, 500 mm NaCl) lysis buffers to obtain chromatin-bound fractions of RF-C. The high salt supernatants were then resolved on a sucrose step gradient (5/10/15/20% sucrose in high salt lysis buffer) by centrifugation in P100TU rotor in a Sorvall ultracentrifuge for 7 h at 45,000 rpm. The nine fractions collected after ultracentrifugation were then analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-RF-Cp145 specific antibodies. The presence of 32P-labeled RF-Cp145 was determined by autoradiography and the presence of RF-Cp145 and RF-Cp37 proteins was determined by immunoblotting. RF-Cp145 Is a Phosphoprotein in Vivo—We generated antibodies specific for RF-Cp145 (large subunit of RF-C) using a recombinant protein spanning amino acid residues 369–480 of RF-Cp145. This antibody specifically detects transfected full-length RF-Cp145 in immunoblots (Fig. 1A). This RF-Cp145-specific antibody also efficiently immunoprecipitated endogenous RF-Cp145 protein and the associated smaller subunits of the RF-C complex such as RF-Cp37 (Fig. 1B, right panel). Using these RF-Cp145-specific antibodies, we examined if endogenous RF-Cp145 is phosphorylated in vivo. Cell extracts from Hela cells labeled with inorganic 32P-orthophosphate were immunoprecipitated with anti-RF-Cp145 antibodies and the immunoprecipitates resolved on denaturating polyacrylamide gels were analyzed by autoradiography. A single major phosphoprotein, which comigrated with immunoreactive RFCp145 was identified in the RF-Cp145 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 1C). RF-Cp145 was also phosphorylated in vivo in other cell lines like COS-1, NIH3T3 (Fig. 1C), and MCF7 (data not shown). As expected no phosphoprotein corresponding to RFCp145 was observed in control immunoprecipitates with preimmune sera. In vivo phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 was also detected with other RF-Cp145-specific antibodies. These included three anti-RF-Cp145 monoclonal antibodies (8Bunz F. Kobayashi R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11014-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which we have found to recognize the 1–368 region of RF-Cp145 (data not shown) and with a rabbit antibody specific for amino acid residues 481–728 of RF-Cp145 (gift of U. Hubscher, Zurich). Transfected HA epitope-tagged RF-Cp145 is phosphorylated in vivo. This was shown by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates from transfected cells with anti-HA epitope-specific antibodies (Fig. 1D). These results taken together demonstrate that RFCp145 is a phosphoprotein in vivo. RF-Cp145 is the primary target of phosphorylation in the RF-C complex since no phosphoproteins co-migrating with immunoreactive RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp30 were observed in anti-RF-Cp145 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1C and Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation of RF-C by cdc2-cyclin B Kinase in Vitro—Recombinant RF-C complex was generated by co-infection of insect cells with five baculoviruses encoding individual RF-C subunits (p145, p40, p38, p37, and p36) and purified on Ni-NTA and Mono Q columns as described (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The RF-Cp40 in this complex is tagged with a His epitope. The presence of this tag does not affect the biological activity of the RF-C complex (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This purified recombinant RF-C complex (Fig. 2A) was a good in vitro substrate for cdc2-cyclin B kinase (Fig. 2B). In contrast, cdk2-cyclin A and cdk2-cyclin E kinases although equally active in phosphorylating histone H1 (Fig. 2C) were unable to phosphorylate the RF-C complex efficiently (Fig. 2B). The large subunit of RF-C is the primary phosphorylation substrate of cdk kinases in such in vitro kinase reactions. In order to determine if such in vitro phosphorylation events occur physiologically, we set out to determine if the RF-C complex (RF-Cp145) is phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 Is Modulated during Cell Cycle Progression—Since the best-studied activity of RF-C is restricted to S phase during DNA replication we wanted to determine the temporal regulation of RF-Cp145 phosphorylation during cell cycle progression. For these studies, HeLa cells were synchronized at the G1/S border using a double thymidine block. After release from the block, cells were collected at various time intervals and analyzed for DNA content to determine their position in cell cycle. In addition, the cells were also stained for a mitotic marker, MPM2, to identify cells in mitosis. Immediately after release from the block, cells entered S phase and by 7 h, had a 4N DNA content. Cells at 7 h after release represented G2 since the peak of MPM2 staining occurred at 8 h after release (Fig. 3A). By 10 h cells were in G1 and shortly thereafter lost synchrony. We next examined the status of RF-Cp145 phosphorylation in synchronized cells collected at various time points after release from a double thymidine block. Cells were labeled with 32P-inorganic phosphate before extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation. The phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 increased as cells traversed through S phase, reaching a peak in G2/M (Fig. 3B). When lysates from the same synchronized HeLa cell populations were analyzed by immunoblotting we found that RF-Cp145 protein levels are not altered significantly in the different phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 3B). The differences in phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 through the cell cycle are thus not due to differences in the levels of RF-Cp145 protein. We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of RFCp145 is cell cycle-regulated. Inhibitor of cdk-cyclin Kinases Abrogates RF-Cp145 Phosphorylation—The cell cycle-dependent in vivo RF-C phosphorylation suggests that phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 may be regulated in vivo by cdk-cyclin kinases. Consistent with such an idea phosphoamino acid analysis of RF-Cp145 shows that it is phosphorylated on serine/threonine residues (data not shown). We therefore examined the effect of cdk-cyclin kinase inhibitor on RF-Cp145 phosphorylation in synchronously cycling cells. Synchronously cycling Hela cells in G2/M, released from a double thymidine block, were cultured either in the presence of 32P-inorganic phosphate alone or in combination with 80 μm roscovitine. Roscovitine has been used previously as a specific inhibitor of cdk2/cdc2-cyclin kinases (19Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 20Meijer L. Kim S.H. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Roscovitine dramatically inhibits the phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 during cell cycle progression through G2/M (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation by cdc2-cyclinB Promotes Dissociation of RF-Cp145 from the RF-C Complex—We next determined if phosphorylation with cdc2-cyclin B leads to a dissociation of RF-Cp145 from the RF-C complex. For these studies we used recombinant RF-C complex, which was purified as described (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). First, the RF-C complex phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2-cyclin B in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was immunoprecipitated with either anti-RF-Cp145 or anti-His (RF-Cp40)-specific antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with anti-His (RF-Cp40)-specific antibodies revealed that more phosphorylated RF-Cp145 was present in the supernatant as compared with the supernatant from anti-RF-Cp145 immunoprecipitations (Fig. 5A, left panel). In contrast when non-phosphorylated RF-C complex is immunoprecipitated with anti-His (RF-Cp40) antibodies (Fig. 5A, middle panel) almost all of the RF-Cp145 and RF-Cp40 is in the pellet. These results suggest that phosphorylation by cdc2-cyclin B kinase in vitro leads to dissociation of RF-Cp145 from the RF-C complex. We then confirmed whether the phosphorylated RF-Cp145, which remains in the supernatant after immunoprecipitation with anti-His-specific antibodies represents RF-Cp145 not associated with RF-Cp40. For this the 32P-phosphorylated RF-C complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-His antibodies as in Fig. 5A. The supernatant was then subjected to immunoprecipitation with either normal rabbit serum, or anti-RF-Cp145-, or anti-RF-Cp40-specific antibodies. The majority of the phosphorylated RF-Cp145 came down with immunoprecipitated RF-Cp145 but not with either normal rabbit serum or with immunoprecipitated RF-Cp40 (Fig. 5B). Finally, the RF-C complex was first immunoprecipitated with anti-His (RF-Cp40) antibodies and the immunoprecipitate was then either mock-phosphorylated or phosphorylated in vitro with cdc2-cyclin B kinase in the presence of cold ATP. The release of RF-Cp145 from the RF-Cp40 immunoprecipitate after phosphorylation was then determined by immunoblotting the immunoprecipitates with anti-RF-Cp40 and anti-RF-Cp145 antibodies. Less RF-Cp145 was found in the pellet after phosphorylation (Fig. 5C) whereas RF-Cp40 remained unchanged. These results together support the conclusion that in vitro phosphorylation of the RF-C complex with cdc2-cyclin B kinase leads to a dissociation of the large subunit from the smaller RF-C subunits like RF-Cp40 of the RF-C complex. Phosphorylated RF-Cp145 Is Not Associated with RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp40 in Vivo—We next examined if phosphorylated RFCp145 is associated with RF-Cp40 and RF-Cp37 during cell cycle progression. Hela cells at different times after release from a double thymidine block were labeled with 32P-inorganic phosphate, and the 32P-labeled cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-RF-Cp37- and anti-RF-Cp40-specific antibodies. The associated phosphorylated RF-Cp145 in the immunoprecipitates was determined by autoradiography. Phosphorylated RF-Cp145 was not associated in a complex with either RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp40 (Fig. 6A). In contrast, non-phosphorylated RF-Cp145 was associated with both RF-Cp37 and RF-Cp40 (Fig. 6A). Under conditions when anti-RF-Cp37 and anti RF-Cp145 antibodies immunoprecipitate similar amounts of RF-Cp145, less than 5% of phosphorylated large subunit was associated with RF-Cp37 immunoprecipitates as compared with RF-Cp145 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A). In order to further demonstrate that phosphorylated RFCp145 was not associated with smaller RF-C subunits, we resolved 32P-labeled HeLa cell extracts on sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitated each fraction with anti-RF-Cp145-specific antibodies. We reproducibly find that phosphorylated RF-Cp145 is found in fractions that do not contain RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp40 (Fig. 6B). As expected, RF-Cp145 immunoblots revealed that RF-Cp145 is present in two types of complexes in mammalian cells. A non-phosphorylated RF-Cp145 complex, which contains associated RF-Cp37 and a second, phosphosphorylated RF-Cp145 complex that is not associated with smaller subunits of RF-C like RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp40 (Fig. 6B). Taken together, the results in Figs. 5 and 6 suggest that phosphorylated RF-Cp145 is not associated with smaller subunits of the RF-C complex in vivo. In this study we show that the large subunit of RF-C is a phosphoprotein and is preferentially phosphorylated as compared with the smaller subunits of RF-C. RF-Cp145 is phosphorylated in vivo in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Our conclusion that the cdc2-cyclin B kinase phosphorylates RF-Cp145 is based on three sets of observations. First, in vitro cdc2-cyclin B is much better at phosphorylating RF-Cp145 as part of an RF-C complex as compared with cdk2-cyclin A or cdk2-cyclin E. Second, phosphorylation of endogenous RF-Cp145 is maximal in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Third, roscovitine, a specific inhibitor of cdc2/cdk2 kinases inhibits phosphorylation of endogenous RF-Cp145 during G2/M. One important conclusion emerging from our studies is that phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 leads to its dissociation from the RF-C complex. First, in vitro phosphorylation of RF-C complex leads to dissociation of RF-Cp145 from RF-Cp40. Second, when immobilized RF-C complex is phosphorylated in vitro, less RFCp145 remains associated with RF-Cp40 after phosphorylation as compared with mock phosphorylated immunoprecipitates. Third, in vivo phosphorylated RF-Cp145 is not associated with endogenous RF-Cp40 or RF-Cp37. Replication protein A (RPA) is another example in which subunit interactions is destabilized by phosphorylation. RPA the major eukaryotic single strand-specific DNA-binding protein, consists of three subunits, RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14. The middle subunit, RPA32, is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The phosphorylated RPA32 subunit is not associated with RPA70, whereas unmodified RPA32 remains associated with RPA70 (21Treuner K. Findeisen M. Strausfeld U. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15556-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cdk-cyclins regulate the activity of other replication proteins in the cell cycle, by either influencing subcellular localization (22Jiang W. Wells N.J. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6193-6198Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) or altering the rates of protein degradation (24Jallepalli P.V. Brown G.W. Muzi-Falconi M. Tien D. Kelly T.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2767-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44905-44911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) or perturbing biological activity (26Voitenleitner C. Rehfuess C. Hilmes M. O'Rear L. Liao P.C.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1611-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We show that RF-Cp145 phosphorylation increases late in S phase and peaks in G2/M phase. Further phosphorylated RFCp145 is not associated with smaller subunits. These results suggest that phosphorylation of RF-Cp145 by cdc2-cyclin B may be part of the general mechanism which coordinates entry into M phase. The studies of Rao and Johnson (28Rao P.N. Johnson R.T. Nature. 1970; 225: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) established that cells in G1 but not G2 are competent to undergo DNA replication when fused to S phase cells. The role of cdk-cyclin activity in preventing replication in G2/M is supported by the generation of a conditional human cdc2 mutant cell line (29Itzhaki J.E. Gilbert C.S. Porter A.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 258-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and earlier observations in yeast that mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases inhibit replication (30Broek D. Bartlett R. Crawford K. Nurse P. Nature. 1991; 349: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 31Hayles J. Fisher D. Woollard A. Nurse P. Cell. 1994; 78: 813-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The mutually exclusive presence of cyclin B-cdc2 and MCMs at origins of replication suggests that cyclin B-cdc2 inhibits replication probably by phosphorylating origin-bound proteins (32Wuarin J. Buck V. Nurse P. Millar J.B. Cell. 2002; 111: 419-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that in addition to inactivating proteins in the preinitiation complex cdc2-cyclin B could also down-regulate replication proteins involved in DNA elongation. We have earlier reported that cdc2 is associated with replicating DNA (33Fotedar R. Roberts J.M. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1991; 56: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observations reported here, CDKs have been reported to be associated with the replicative complex, which includes RF-C (34Frouin I. Montecucco A. Biamonti G. Hubscher U. Spadari S. Maga G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). CDKs associate in a cell cycle-dependent manner with the chromatin-associated complex (34Frouin I. Montecucco A. Biamonti G. Hubscher U. Spadari S. Maga G. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2485-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study we extend the scope of the earlier observations by showing that RF-C proteins are targets of CDK activity. What is not clear is if other kinases besides CDKs play additional roles in regulating RF-C activity. In this direction phosphorylation of RF-C by Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II has been reported to inactivate RF-C activity in vitro (35Maga G. Mossi R. Fischer R. Berchtold M.W. Hubscher U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5300-5310Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Our demonstration in this study that RF-C phosphorylation can be inhibited by roscovitine suggests that in vivo, kinases like Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II target RF-C subsequent to CDK phosphorylation. In transfection experiments with full-length and RF-Cp145 domains we find that full-length RF-Cp145 (1–1148), domain N (1–394), and domain B (481–728) are phosphorylated whereas domain A (395–480) is not (data not shown). Comparison of the two-dimensional tryptic maps of full-length RF-Cp145, domain N (1–394), and domain B (481–728) show that the phosphopeptides present in full-length RF-Cp145 are the sum of the phosphopeptides in domain N and domain B (data not shown). The C-terminal end (729–1148 region) of RF-Cp145, which is both required and sufficient to form the RF-C complex in vitro (36Uhlmann F. Cai J. Gibbs E. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10058-10064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and in vivo (37Pennaneach V. Salles-Passador I. Munshi A. Brickner H. Regazzoni K. Dick F. Dyson N. Chen T.T. Wang J.Y. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 715-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is unlikely to be phosphorylated in vivo. Structural studies with the E. coli clamp loader, γ complex: δ′-γ1-γ2-γ3-δ (17Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) demonstrate that the C-terminal domains of δ′ (hRF-Cp38 homolog), γ, and δ (hRF-Cp145 homolog) form a helical scaffold (circular collar) and the N-terminal ends appear to dangle under the C-terminal pentamer umbrella. The presence of an extensive interface suggests that C-terminal regions of δ′ and γ are tightly linked and not easily perturbed. The C-terminal domain of δ probably swivel with respect to the rest of the helical scaffold as the γ complex undergoes conformational changes based on structural and modeling studies (38Jeruzalmi D. Yurieva O. Zhao Y. Young M. Stewart J. Hingorani M. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro reconstitution studies with recombinant human RF-C complex, RF-Cp145 has been shown to have subunit contacts with RF-Cp40 and RF-Cp38 (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 39Ellison V. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5979-5987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structural studies with the E. coli γ complex reveals that the hRFCp145 equivalent δ subunit contacts δ′ and γ3 subunits (17Jeruzalmi D. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 106: 429-441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 40O'Donnell M. Jeruzalmi D. Kuriyan J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R935-R946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This demonstrates a remarkable conservation of intersub-unit interactions from the γ complex to the human RF-C complex. Does RF-Cp145 phosphorylation induce its dissociation from the RF-C2–5 complex? Our in vitro experiments in Fig. 5C suggest that when the RF-C complex is immobilized, phosphorylation with cdc2-cyclin B leads to dissociation of the RFCp145 subunit from the rest of the RF-C complex. This result would be consistent with the conclusion from the γ complex structure that the large subunit is less tightly bound as compared with the smaller subunits and has the capacity to undergo major structural transitions. The subunit interactions of recombinant RF-C complex are consistent with this conclusion. RF-Cp145 is recruited to the RF-C complex after the smaller subunits p40/p38/p37/p36 (RF-C2–5) form a core complex (14Podust V.N. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6303-6310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 15Uhlmann F. Cai J. Flores-Rozas H. Dean F.B. Finkelstein J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6521-6526Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that RF-Cp145 dissociates from the RF-C2–5 core, which remains intact. Using different approaches we clearly demonstrate that in vivo phosphorylated RF-Cp145 is not associated with RF-Cp37 or RF-Cp40. The smaller RF-C2–5 subunits associate with proteins, which substitute for the RF-Cp145 subunit to form three alternative RF-C complexes. First, Rad17 (Rad24) forms a complex with RF-C2–5, which plays a critical role in checkpoint signaling (41Green C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lowndes N.F. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 39-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 42Shimomura T. Ando S. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5485-5491Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 43Naiki T. Shimomura T. Kondo T. Matsumoto K. Sugimoto K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5888-5896Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Second, RF-C2–5 associates with Cft18 to play a critical role in sister chromatin cohesin (44Mayer M.L. Gygi S.P. Aebersold R. Hieter P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 959-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Third, the Elg1-RF-C complex has been suggested to be required for maintaining genomic integrity (45Bellaoui M. Chang M. Ou J. Xu H. Boone C. Brown G.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4304-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Our results raise the possibility that RF-Cp145 phosphorylation may play a critical regulatory role in destabilizing the replicative RF-C complex, which would thus allow the checkpoint or the cohesin RF-C complex to be formed with Rad17 or Cft18, respectively. In addition our results leave open the possibility that in mammalian cells the phosphorylated RF-Cp145 subunit associates with other unknown proteins after it dissociates from the pentameric RF-C complex. The size of the phosphorylated RF-Cp145 complex is consistent with such a possibility. Answering these questions is a challenge for future studies. We thank B. Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor) for anti-RF-Cp145-specific monoclonal antibodies, J. Hurwitz (New York) for anti-RF-Cp37 and anti-RF-Cp40 antibodies, and U. Hubscher (Zurich) for antibodies specific for the RF-Cp145 domain B."
https://openalex.org/W1959274619,"Mathematical proofs can run into hundreds of pages, making it extremely difficult to check whether they are correct. In his Perspective, [Sudan][1] asks whether methods developed by theoretical computer scientists may help to verify mathematical proofs. The approach enables the probabilistic checking of proofs by reading just a few bits. However, the proofs need to be written in a specific new format. Mathematicians may not find the method useful, because they expect more insights from proofs than just their correctness, but the new methods may find use in the verification of the correct execution of computer programs.
