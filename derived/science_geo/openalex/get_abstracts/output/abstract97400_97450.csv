https://openalex.org/W2058495576,"The antihistaminic over-the-counter drug methapyrilene hydrochloride, mixed with food at a concentration of 0.1 percent, was administered to 50 male and 50 female Fischer rats. A second group of 50 male and 50 female rats was given the same treatment together with 0.2 percent of sodium nitrite added to the food. Almost all of the rats in both groups developed liver neoplasms, mainly hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas. The first rat died with a liver neoplasm at the 43rd week. Over 50 percent of the rats in both groups had metastases from the carcinomas of the liver to distant organs. Control rats treated with nitrite only, or untreated, did not develop liver neoplasms. There was no discernible effect of nitrite on the carcinogenicity of methapyrilene hydrochloride."

Multiple sensitivity was demonstrated both in single fungiform papillae and in single taste buds, with response to all four of the basic taste qualities occurring in a single taste bud."

https://openalex.org/W2060540396,Neurons in the torus semicircularis of the weakly electric fish Eigenmannia encode phase differences between sinusoidal electrical stimuli received in different body regions. These fish normally experience time-varying phase differences when the electric organ discharge fields of two or more individuals overlap. These phase differences supply information necessary for the animal's jamming avoidance behavior.
