https://openalex.org/W2015289915,"THE identification of primary effects of potassium in plant cells has proved to be one of the most elusive problems in mineral nutrition. Many widespread physiological disturbances accompanying potassium deficiency are well known, especially in the fields of nitrogen and carbohydrate metabolism; but the immediate causes of the characteristic (yet variable) leaf symptoms and the premature death of foliage have been almost entirely a matter for speculation. This communication is intended to direct attention to the fact that in barley, at least, putrescine is produced and accumulated under certain conditions of potassium deficiency, and that some of the observed symptoms may well be directly attributable to its presence."
https://openalex.org/W1984020051,"THE role of air-borne mould spores in asthma, especially Alternaria and Cladosporium, has been recognized as the result of the work of Feinberg1 and Durham2. These workers used mainly the gravity slide and Petri dish exposure method to determine the spore content of the air. Both methods are highly selective for different reasons : the former catches larger pollen grains and spores and rarely catches small spores, while the latter only records organisms able to grow on the culture media exposed and therefore selects the more readily growing moulds. Feinberg1 has stated that basidiospores cause respiratory tract allergy, but data on their occurrence in the atmosphere have been lacking, no doubt because they are not detected by the usual methods."

https://openalex.org/W1993955563,"11-Dehydro-17-hydroxycorticosterone (cortisone) and a number of other adrenal cortical hormones and their metabolites have been found in human placentas. The ethyl acetate extract of a finely minced placenta, freed from blood so far as possible, was evaporated to small volume, washed with 0.2 M sodium carbonate, 0.2 N hydrochloric acid and 0.1 M sodium acetate and evaporated to dryness. The residue was taken up in petroleum ether and extracted with 70 per cent aqueous ethanol. The united lower layers were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was taken up in benzene which was extracted ten times with equal volumes of water. The united aqueous layers were extracted with chloroform, and the extract dried and evaporated to dryness. The residue was examined by paper chromatography at 37° using a benzene–50 per cent methanol system1. Several α,β-unsaturated ketonic substances were present. That present in largest amount reduced triphenyl tetrazolium chloride, had the same RF value as cortisone and gave a blue colour with iodine. Elution with 90 per cent ethanol was followed by evaporation to dryness and acetylation with acetic anhydride in pyridine. The resulting acetate was examined by paper chromatography at 37° using a benzene–petroleum ether (1 : 1): 80 per cent methanol system, and was found to have the same RF value as cortisone acetate. Rough estimation of the fluorescence in ultra-violet light after treatment with methanolic caustic soda indicated a yield of approximately 100 µgm. cortisone per placenta. Traces of 17-hydroxycorticosterone are also present, and at least three other α,β-unsaturated 3-ketosteroids which are at present unidentified."

https://openalex.org/W2051888008,"‘DARAPRIM’ [2 : 4-diamino-5-(-4′-chlorophenyl)-6-ethyl pyrimidine (50–63) ] has been described1 as having high antimalarial activity in laboratory infections of Plasmodium gallinaceum, Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium cynomolgi. More recently, it has also been tried in the treatment and suppression of human malaria2. It has been shown that proguanil-resistant strains of the first two species are sensitive to ‘Daraprim’ and that ‘Daraprim’ resistance is not easily produced in P. gallinaceum infections3."

https://openalex.org/W2031593516,"CONTROVERSY has centred around the nature of the active groups influencing the activity of alkaline phosphatases of higher animals1. In a recent communication2, I suggested on the basis of results obtained with the alkaline phosphatase of the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, Q-176, that the activity of the enzyme is influenced by both zinc and magnesium ions and that the relative proportion in which these ions existed in an active state determined the pH of optimum activity."

Indeed, previously in such attempted cross-transmissions we have had little success although we have transmitted the polyhedral virus of the common clothes moth, Tineola bisselliella, to the case-bearing larva of another species of clothes moth, T. pellionella."

https://openalex.org/W2025860975,"IT has recently been demonstrated that reasonably homogeneous preparations of cell nuclei can be isolated in good yield from rat or mouse liver1. By means of centrifugal fractionation of liver homogenates prepared in an aqueous medium (0.25 M sucrose – 0.0018 M calcium chloride), it has been possible to obtain 70–90 per cent of the nuclei with a minimum of cytological alteration in preparations containing by direct count less than 1 per cent of the intact cells of the tissue and less than 0.5 per cent of the free mitochondria of the homogenates."

Feigl and his co-workers, has been used exclusively for qualitative purposes, we have discovered a method for the estimation of various substances by using circular filter papers and the solvents which are commonly used in paper partition chromatography."

https://openalex.org/W2037570174,"DURING a study of the inter-relationships between light intensity, temperature and the biological effects of 2 : 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, it was found in the case of Lemna minor (duckweed) that when the concentration of the growth regulator in the external water culture solution was sufficiently high to kill some of the fronds at the end of three days exposure, then the mortality increased with decreasing light intensity over the range of continuous illumination 700–180 ft. candles. It was further observed that, whereas the degree of toxicity was markedly dependent on the light intensity received by the fronds prior to treatment with the dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (‘pre-treatment period’), yet similar variations in the intensity during the following short ‘treatment period’ of three days had no effect."
