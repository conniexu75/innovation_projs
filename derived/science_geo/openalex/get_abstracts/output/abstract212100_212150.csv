https://openalex.org/W2064288087,"A BIOLOGICALLY active peptide which is chemically and physiologically distinct from known pituitary hormones has recently been isolated and characterized1. Its purity has been established by various criteria such as column chromatography and gel filtration, zone electrophoresis and disk electrophoresis, countercurrent distribution and sedimentation. This peptide, which was obtained in the course of the isolation of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) by a revised method2, is more acidic than the latter hormone, and consists of 59 amino-acids. Its molecular weight was determined by sedimentation equilibrium investigations and found to be 6,900. It is structurally different from ACTH, having lysine rather than phenylalanine at the COOH-terminus, and glutamic acid rather than the serine at the NH2-terminus; furthermore, it has a different amino-acid composition. It has a very low adrenocorticotropic activity, and resembles ACTH in melanocyte-stimulating activity; however, it is not potentiated by treatment with boiling NaOH, as is ACTH. Although the lipolytic potencies in the rabbit as determined in vitro were comparable for both peptides, they differed markedly in the rat."

https://openalex.org/W2031477316,"SEVERAL investigations dealing with interocular transfer of learning of visual discriminations in split-brain cats and monkeys support the general conclusion that brain bisection including the optic chiasm and posterior corpus callosum restricts the learning and memory of the discriminations to the trained hemisphere. These tasks cannot be correctly performed through the other eye until it has received comparable training, in contrast to the immediate interocular transfer usually shown by normal or chiasm-sectioned controls1–3. This generalization has been qualified by more recent studies indicating that transfer of learning of brightness4,5 and pattern6 discriminations in split-brain cats, and of brightness and colour discriminations in split-brain monkeys7, does occur under certain conditions. Transfer of colour and brightness learning in split-brain monkeys would, therefore, seem to be dependent on the conditions used. It appeared advisable, in reference to future studies on vision, to see if transfer of these tasks takes place under the conditions at present being used in this laboratory."

Moreover, Freund's adjuvant alone has also been shown to exert a protective effect5."

In the last, each clone contains appreciable proportions of haploid and diploid cells indicating a rate of interconversion substantially higher than in the first two types. Each of these ploidal varieties can be isolated from the others2."

https://openalex.org/W2012146758,"WE have already reported that several halogenated pyrimidines including 5-fluorodeoxyuridine (FUDR) did not show a complete inhibition of the multiplication of adeno type 1 virus in the experiments using the TCID50 estimating dilution method, while vaccinia virus was clearly inhibited with FUDR and some other halogenated pyrimidines1. On the contrary, Flanagan and Ginsberg2 and Green3 reported that FUDR showed clear inhibition during the early phase of the multiplication of adeno type 4 or type 2 viruses. Thus, the results previously described by us1 seemed inconsistent with those obtained by them2,3. If the sensitivity of adeno virus towards the inhibitory effect of FUDR is not so clear as vaccinia virus shows, it might be suggested that the metabolic pathway essential for the replication of adeno virus must be a different one from, the ways blocked by halogenated pyrimidines. To prove this point, the influence of FUDR on the single growth curve and the cell-infective unit of adeno type 1 virus was investigated."

To be reported here are some observations throwing light on the structural role of the metal atoms in one of these modifications, namely, RNase I (space group P212121)."
