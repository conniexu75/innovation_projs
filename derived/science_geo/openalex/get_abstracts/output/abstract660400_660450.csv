https://openalex.org/W3090399143,"Background Digitalisation affects 90% of healthcare. Digital health, however, does not only refer to technological transformation but also has considerable cultural and social consequences. It fundamentally reshapes the roles of physicians and patients, as well as their relationship. Moreover, from the second half of the 20th century, the growing number of chronic patients and the increase in life expectancy have posed new challenges to the medical workforce. Objectives To explore the digitally engaged physician’s knowledge and attitudes towards digital health technologies and the transformation of the doctor-patient relationship. Methods A qualitative interview study analysed with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The study is based on qualitative, semi-structured interviews with 11 digitally engaged physicians from 9 countries. We identified four main themes emerging from e-physicians’ responses and experience: 1) the past: intentions and experiences of change, 2) the present: the role of digital health and technology in the medical practice and their everyday challenges, 3) the present: the practical and ideal physician-patient relationship, and 4) the future: skills and competencies needed for working with e-patients and visions about the future of the medical practice. Results The interviewed physicians state that digital health solutions could create a deeper doctor-patient relationship: knowledgeable patients are a huge help in the joint work effort and technology is the main tool for creating a more involved and responsible patient. Medical professionals in the future might rather get a role as a translator between technical data and the patient; as a guide in the jungle of digital health. However, the interviewed physicians also noted that digital transition today is more beneficial to patients than to their doctors. Conclusions We state that digitally engaged physicians are characterized by a kind of dichotomy: they use digital opportunities enthusiastically, but they also feel the difficulties related to digital health."

PR proteins are cluster of proteins with low molecular weight which get incited in plants under different stresses. In this paper, in-silico approaches are used to compare the physico-chemical properties of 6 PR proteins (PR1, PR2, PR5, PR9, PR10, PR12) of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. Topological analysis revealed the presence of transmembrane localization of PR2 and absence of transmembrane domain in PR10 of both model plants studied. Amino acid composition shows the dominance of small aliphatic amino acids i.e. alanine, glycine and serine in both plants studied. These results highlights the similarities and differences between PRs of both model plants, which provides clue towards their diversified roles in plants."
https://openalex.org/W3090863142,"Every day, society's concern over pollution caused by plastic waste grows greater. One of the most intensive sectors for the use of plastic is the food industry. Companies in this sector face the challenge of transitioning to a more sustainable and less intensive model of plastic use, respecting the principles established for a circular economy. Accordingly, one of the questions that industries tend to ask is whether sustainability will influence the consumer's purchase decision. To respond to this, the factors that determine a consumer's sustainable purchase decision in relation to the plastic and food industry have been analyzed in this paper. For this, a regression analysis was performed on a sample of Dutch consumers. The results show that the decision of purchase of the consumer of the Food Industry is conditioned by factors such as age, sustainable behavior, knowledge of the Circular economy and the perception of usefulness of plastic."
https://openalex.org/W3090701623,"Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2) encoded by the NFE2L2 gene is a transcription factor critical for protecting cells from chemically-induced oxidative stress. We developed computational procedures to identify chemical modulators of NRF2 in a large database of human microarray data. A gene expression biomarker was built from statistically-filtered gene lists derived from microarray experiments in primary human hepatocytes and cancer cell lines exposed to NRF2-activating chemicals (oltipraz, sulforaphane, CDDO-Im) or in which the NRF2 suppressor Keap1 was knocked down by siRNA. Directionally consistent biomarker genes were further filtered for those dependent on NRF2 using a microarray dataset from cells after NFE2L2 siRNA knockdown. The resulting 143-gene biomarker was evaluated as a predictive tool using the correlation-based Running Fisher algorithm. Using 59 gene expression comparisons from chemically-treated cells with known NRF2 activating potential, the biomarker gave a balanced accuracy of 93%. The biomarker was comprised of many well-known NRF2 target genes (AKR1B10, AKR1C1, NQO1, TXNRD1, SRXN1, GCLC, GCLM), 69% of which were found to be bound directly by NRF2 using ChIP-Seq. NRF2 activity was assessed across ~9840 microarray comparisons from ~1460 studies examining the effects of ~2260 chemicals in human cell lines. A total of 260 and 43 chemicals were found to activate or suppress NRF2, respectively, most of which have not been previously reported to modulate NRF2 activity. Using a NRF2-responsive reporter gene in HepG2 cells, we confirmed the activity of a set of chemicals predicted using the biomarker. The biomarker will be useful for future gene expression screening studies of environmentally-relevant chemicals."
https://openalex.org/W3090545500,"Copper oxide (CuO) has been broadly used in different technological and biological applications. However, based on the literature review, there are few reports describing the synthesis of tungsten doped copper oxide and its biological applications, although CuO and W (tungsten) based nanomaterials have been reportedly already synthesized. In this study we synthesized novel CuO and CuO/W (at.1%, 2% and 4%) nanoparticles and explored their tungsten content-dependent bactericide activity. In order to obtain the materials, was used a co-precipitation method which is of low cost. The synthesized materials were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD); XRD results indicated that only the sample with at.1% of W presented pure Tenorite phase. Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) allowed to obtain the band gap energy values; CuO/W (at.2%) sample exhibited the minimum value of 2.62 eV. Grains sizes ranging from 39.78 to 53.47 nm were established through field emission-scanning electronic microscopy (FE-SEM), and these sizes were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Doping with W also influenced the morphology obtained in all cases. BET (Brunauer, Emmett, Teller) analysis allowed to establish an increase in specific surface area and pore size with W doping. The particle size was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The bactericidal properties were tested using well diffusion method for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Bactericide response of CuO nanoparticles was improved by the inclusion of W dopant into the CuO structure, leading to an expansion in the inhibition zone for the CuO/W (at.1%) sample; inhibition halo diameters were 1.5 and 12 mm for CuO and CuO/W (at.1%), respectively. Hence, it was possible to infer the remarkable importance of the crystalline phase, morphology, particle size and specific superficial area of the CuO/W (at.1%) nanoparticles in its bactericide performance. WO3 secondary phase affected the bactericide response of the materials obtained at at.2% and at.4% of tungsten content."
https://openalex.org/W3089655035,"This research work aims to develop a deep learning-based crop classification framework for remotely sensed time series data. Tobacco is a major revenue generating crop of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province of Pakistan, with over 90% of the country's Tobacco production. In order to analyze the performance of the developed classification framework, a pilot sub-region named Yar Hussain is selected for experimentation work. Yar Hussain is a tehsil of district Swabi, within KP province of Pakistan, having highest contribution to the gross production of the KP Tobacco crop. KP generally consists of a diverse crop land with different varieties of vegetation, having similar phenology which makes crop classification a challenging task. In this study, a temporal convolutional neural network (TempCNNs) model is implemented for crop classification, while considering remotely sensed imagery of the selected pilot region with specific focus on the Tobacco crop. In order to improve the performance of the proposed classification framework, instead of using the prevailing concept of utilizing a single satellite imagery, both Sentinel-2 and Planet-Scope imageries are stacked together to assist in providing more diverse features to the proposed classification framework. Furthermore, instead of using a single date satellite imagery, multiple satellite imageries with respect to the phenological cycle of Tobacco crop are temporally stacked together which resulted in a higher temporal resolution of the employed satellite imagery. The developed framework is trained using the ground truth data. The final output is obtained as an outcome of the SoftMax function of the developed model in the form of probabilistic values, for the classification of the selected classes. The proposed deep learning-based crop classification framework, while utilizing multi-satellite temporally stacked imagery resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 98.15%. Furthermore, as the developed classification framework evolved with specific focus on Tobacco crop, it resulted in best Tobacco crop classification accuracy of 99%."
https://openalex.org/W3090015172,"Background Few studies have evaluated iron-rich plant-based foods, such as amaranth grain, to reduce anemia and iron deficiency anemia. Amaranth is rich in nutrients, but with high level of phytate. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the efficacy of home processed amaranth grain containing bread in the treatment of anemia, hemoglobin concentration and iron deficiency anemia among two-to-five year-old children in Southern Ethiopia. Method Children with anemia (hemoglobin concentration <110.0g/L) (N = 100) were identified by random sampling and enrolled in a 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial for six months in 2017. The amaranth group (N = 50), received 150g bread containing 70% amaranth and 30% chickpea, the amaranth grain was processed at home (soaking, germinating, and fermenting) to decrease the phytate level. The maize group (N = 50), received 150g bread, containing processed maize (roasted and fermented) to give a similar color and structure with amaranth bread. Hemoglobin, ferritin, and CRP were measured at baseline and at the end of intervention. Hemoglobin and ferritin values were adjusted for altitude and infection, respectively. Generalized estimating equation and generalized linear model were used to analyze the data. Result In the last follow-up measure anemia prevalence was significantly lower in the amaranth group (32%) as compared with the maize group (56%) [adjusted risk ratios, aRR: 0.39 (95%CI: 0.16–0.77)]. Hemoglobin concentration estimate of beta coefficient was significantly higher in the amaranth group compared with the maize group [aβ 8.9g/L (95%CI: 3.5–14.3)], p-value <0.01. The risk of iron deficiency anemia is significantly lower in the amaranth group [aRR: 0.44 (95%CI: 0.23–0.83)] in the intention to treat analysis but not significant in the complete case analysis. There was no significant difference between groups in iron deficiency [aRR: 0.81 (95%CI: 0.55–1.19)]. Conclusion Processed amaranth bread had favorable effects on hemoglobin concentration and has the potential to minimize anemia prevalence.

https://openalex.org/W3090704949,"Objective To examine the impact of ethanol sclerotherapy (EST) for endometrioma on in vitro fertilization (IVF) cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) in women with moderate-severe endometriosis. Methods This retrospective cohort study included women with moderate-severe endometriosis (revised American Fertility Society stage III-IV) and endometrioma who underwent IVF with the ultra-long agonist protocol. We compared two groups: women undergoing EST for endometrioma before IVF (EST group), and women whose endometrioma was left in situ during IVF (No-EST group). The primary outcome was the CLBR per IVF cycle, including fresh and frozen embryo transfers. The secondary endpoints included the complication rate, number of mature oocytes retrieved, clinical pregnancy rate and pregnancy loss rate. Results Seventy-four women were included in the study, with 37 in the EST group and 37 in the No-EST group, representing 67 and 69 IVF cycles, respectively. The population and cycle characteristics were comparable between the two groups, especially the ovarian response to stimulation. The CLBR was significantly increased in the EST group compared to the No-EST group (31.3% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.03). The clinical and biochemical pregnancy rates were significantly increased in the EST group (37.3% vs. 15.9%, p = 0.01 and 43.3% vs. 23.2%, p = 0.01, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed a significantly increased chance of live birth in women exposed to EST before IVF with an adjusted OR of 2.68 (95% confidence interval, CI: 1.13–6.36, p = 0.02). In the EST group, we reported one major complication Clavien and Dindo classification grade III, complication involving an ovarian abscess that required a laparoscopic drainage. Conclusions EST is an interesting technique to improve IVF success rates in women with moderate-severe endometriosis. EST could be discussed before IVF in infertile women."
https://openalex.org/W3089396936,"Background Overdose response has become an increasingly relevant component of paramedic practice, particularly in light of increased opioid overdose globally. Previous studies have noted gaps in our understanding regarding the unique challenges which paramedics face during this form of pre-hospital emergency care. The aim of this study is to explore and describe the ways in which paramedics experience overdose response, specifically within a community markedly affected by the overdose crisis. Methods Ten participants were recruited from a single ambulance station located in an urban center in Western Canada. Two rounds of semi-structured individual interviews were conducted, and data saturation was found to have been reached. Verbatim transcripts were produced and subject to two rounds of descriptive and pattern coding. A second researcher reviewed all of the codes, with disagreements being handled by discussion until agreement was obtained. Themes were identified, along with a Core Category which seeks to describe the underlying dynamics of overdose response represented in our data. The concept of a Core Category was borrowed from Grounded Theory methodology. Findings Five major themes were identified: Connecting with patients’ lived experiences; Occupying roles as clinicians and patient advocates; Navigating on-scene hazards; Difficulties with transitions of care; and Emotional burden of the overdose crisis. A core category was identified as One’s capacity to help. Conclusions This research contributes to existing literature on overdose response by specifically examining paramedic experiences during this form of emergency care. While paramedics felt highly confident in providing clinical care, their capacity to address underlying causes of drug use was understood as much more limited. Participants found ways to address this lack of control, along with feelings of frustration, by trying to understand patient perspectives and adopting empathetic attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3089629918,"Rice is critical for sustainable food and nutritional security; however, nominal micronutrient quantities in grains aggravate malnutrition in rice-eating poor populations. In this study, we evaluated genetic diversity in grain iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) contents using trait-linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in the representative subset of a large collection of local and exotic rice germplasm. Results demonstrated that aromatic fine grain accessions contained relatively higher Fe and Zn contents in brown rice (BR) than coarse grain accessions and a strong positive correlation between both mineral elements. Genotyping with 24 trait-linked SSR markers identified 21 polymorphic markers, among which 17 demonstrated higher gene diversity and polymorphism information content (PIC) values, strongly indicating that markers used in current research were moderate to highly informative for evaluating the genetic diversity. Population structure, principal coordinate and phylogenetic analyses classified studied rice accessions into two fine grain specific and one fine and coarse grain admixture subpopulations. Single marker analysis recognized four ZnBR and single FeBR significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) contributing 15.41–39.72% in total observed phenotypic variance. Furthermore, high grain Fe and Zn contents linked marker alleles from significant MTAs were also identified. Collectively, these results indicate a wide genetic diversity exist in grain Fe and Zn contents of studied rice accessions and reveal perspective for marker-assisted biofortification breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3089979743,"Pain management is the pillar of caring for patients with traumatic rib fractures. Intravenous lidocaine (IVL) is a well-established non-opioid analgesic for post-operative pain, yet its efficacy has yet to be investigated in trauma patients. We hypothesized that IVL is associated with decreased inpatient opioid requirements among patients with rib fractures.We retrospectively evaluated adult patients presenting to our Level 1 trauma center with isolated chest wall injuries. After 1:1 propensity score matching patients who received vs did not receive IVL, we compared the two groups' average daily opioid use, opioid use in the last 24 hours of admission, and pain scores during admissions hours 24-48. We performed multivariable linear regression for these outcomes (with sensitivity analysis for the opioid use outcomes), adjusting for age as a moderating factor and controlling for hospital length of stay and injury severity.We identified 534 patients, among whom 226 received IVL. Those who received IVL were older and had more serious injury. Compared to propensity-score matched patients who did not receive IVL, patients who received IVL had similar average daily opioid use and pain scores, but 40% lower opioid use during the last 24 hours of admission (p = 0.002). Multivariable regression-with and without sensitivity analysis-did not show an effect of IVL on any outcomes.IVL was crudely associated with decreased opioid requirements in the last 24 hours of admission, the time period associated with opioid use at 90 days post-discharge. However, we did not observe beneficial effects of IVL on multivariable adjusted analyses; we are conducting a randomized control trial to further evaluate IVL's opioid-sparing effects for patients with rib fractures."
https://openalex.org/W3090662279,"Life expectancy of contemporary cardiac pacemakers is limited due to the use of an internal primary battery. Repeated device replacement interventions are necessary, which leads to an elevated risk for patients and an increase of health care costs. The aim of our study is to investigate the feasibility of powering an endocardial pacemaker by converting a minimal amount of the heart’s kinetic energy into electric energy. The intrinsic cardiac muscle activity makes it an ideal candidate as continuous source of energy for endocardial pacemakers. For this reason, we developed a prototype able to generate enough power to supply a pacing circuit at different heart rates. The prototype consists of a mass imbalance that drives an electromagnetic generator while oscillating. We developed a mathematical model to estimate the amount of energy harvested from the right ventricle. Finally, the implemented prototype was successfully tested during in-vitro and in-vivo experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3090792799,"Mineral deficiency is worldwide one of the major problems associated with human health, and biofortification through breeding is considered an important strategy to improve the nutritional content of staple food in countries that face this problem. The assessment of genetic variability for seed nutrient contents is a first step in the development of a biofortified crop. From the germplasm bank IDR–IAPAR–EMATER, a set of 1,512 common bean accessions, consisting of local and commercial varieties and improved lines, was analyzed. High variability among the accessions was observed for all evaluated nutrient contents (P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Fe and S and protein). In the mean, the contents of the carioca and black market groups (Mesoamerican gene pool), were around 7% higher for the minerals Ca, Cu, Mn and Fe and between 2–4% higher for P, K, Mg and Zn than in the other groups with Mesoamerican and Andean common bean. Few differences were observed among the Mesoamerican accessions that belong to the carioca and black commercial groups. Wide variability was observed among the evaluated genotypes, and the concentrations of the best accessions exceeded the overall mean by 14–28%. Due to the high variability in the evaluated accessions, these results may contribute to the selection of promising parents for the establishment of mating blocks. The nutritional contents of many of the improved lines evaluated in this study were higher than those of the commercial cultivars, indicating the possibility of developing new biofortified cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W3091023692,"The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is expressed in T cells after activation with antigen and is constitutively expressed in T cells from patients at-risk for and with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). RAGE expression was associated with an activated T cell phenotype, leading us to examine whether RAGE is involved in T cell signaling. In primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with T1D or healthy control subjects, RAGE- cells showed reduced phosphorylation of Erk. To study T cell receptor signaling in RAGE+ or-T cells, we compared signaling in RAGE+/+ Jurkat cells, Jurkat cells with RAGE eliminated by CRISPR/Cas9, or silenced with siRNA. In RAGE KO Jurkat cells, there was reduced phosphorylation of Zap70, Erk and MEK, but not Lck or CD3ξ. RAGE KO cells produced less IL-2 when activated with anti-CD3 +/- anti-CD28. Stimulation with PMA restored signaling and (with ionomycin) IL-2 production. Silencing RAGE with siRNA also decreased signaling. Our studies show that RAGE expression in human T cells is associated with an activated signaling cascade. These findings suggest a link between inflammatory products that are found in patients with diabetes, other autoimmune diseases, and inflammation that may enhance T cell reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W3091318152,"Houttuynia cordata (Saururaceae), an ancient and relic species, has been used as an important medicinal and edible plant in most parts of Asia. However, because of the lack of genome information and reliable molecular markers, studies on its population structure, or phylogenetic relationships with other related species are still rare. Here, we de novo assembled the complete chloroplast (cp) genome of H. cordata using the integration of the long PacBio and short Illumina reads. The cp genome of H. cordata showed a typical quadripartite cycle of 160,226 bp. This included a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb) of 26,853 bp, separated by a large single-copy (LSC) region of 88,180 bp and a small single-copy (SSC) region of 18,340 bp. A total of 112 unique genes, including 79 protein-coding genes, 29 tRNA genes, and four rRNA genes, were identified in this cp genome. Eighty-one genes were located on the LSC region, 13 genes were located on the SSC region, and 17 two-copy genes were located on the IR region. Additionally, 48 repeat sequences and 86 SSR loci, which can be used as genomic markers for population structure analysis, were also detected. Phylogenetic analysis using 21 cp genomes of the Piperales family demonstrated that H. cordata had a close relationship with the species within the Aristolochia genus. Moreover, the results of mVISTA analysis and comparisons of IR regions demonstrated that the cp genome of H. cordata was conserved with that of the Aristolochia species. Our results provide valuable information for analyzing the genetic diversity and population structure of H. cordata, which can contribute to further its genetic improvement and breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3089955143,"A variety of traits are necessary for bacterial colonization of the interior of plant hosts, including well-studied virulence effectors as well as other phenotypes contributing to bacterial growth and survival within the apoplast. High-throughput methods such as transposon sequencing (TnSeq) are powerful tools to identify such genes in bacterial pathogens. However, there is little information as to the distinctiveness of traits required for bacterial colonization of different hosts. Here, we utilize randomly barcoded TnSeq (RB-TnSeq) to identify the genes that contribute to the ability of Pseudomonas syringae strain B728a to grow within common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), and pepper (Capsicum annuum); species representing two different plant families. The magnitude of contribution of most genes to apoplastic fitness in each of the plant hosts was similar. However, 50 genes significantly differed in their fitness contributions to growth within these species. These genes encoded proteins in various functional categories including polysaccharide synthesis and transport, amino acid metabolism and transport, cofactor metabolism, and phytotoxin synthesis and transport. Six genes that encoded unannotated, hypothetical proteins also contributed differentially to growth in these hosts. The genetic repertoire of a relatively promiscuous pathogen such as P. syringae may thus be shaped, at least in part, by the conditional contribution of some fitness determinants."
https://openalex.org/W3091008514,"Introduction First study of social inequalities in tobacco-attributable mortality (TAM) in Spain considering the joint influence of sex, age, and education (intersectional perspective). Methods Data on all deaths due to cancer, cardiometabolic and respiratory diseases among people aged ≥35 years in 2016 were obtained from the Spanish Statistical Office. TAM was calculated based on sex-, age- and education-specific smoking prevalence, and on sex-, age- and disease-specific relative risks of death for former and current smokers vs lifetime non-smokers. As inequality measures, the relative index of inequality (RII) and the slope index of inequality (SII) were calculated using Poisson regression. The RII is interpreted as the relative risk of mortality between the lowest and the highest educational level, and the SII as the absolute difference in mortality. Results The crude TAM rate was 55 and 334 per 100,000 in women and men, respectively. Half of these deaths occurred among people with the lowest educational level (27% of the population). The RII for total mortality was 0.39 (95%CI: 0.35–0.42) in women and 1.61 (95%CI: 1.55–1.67) in men. The SII was -41 and 111 deaths per 100,000, respectively. Less-educated women aged <55 years and men (all ages) showed an increased mortality risk; nonetheless, less educated women aged ≥55 had a reduced risk. Conclusions TAM is inversely associated with educational level in men and younger women, and directly associated with education in older women. This could be explained by different smoking patterns. Appropriate tobacco control policies should aim to reduce social inequalities in TAM."
https://openalex.org/W3089354046,"A geographically isolated maize landrace cultivated on nitrogen-depleted fields without synthetic fertilizer in the Sierra Mixe region of Oaxaca, Mexico utilizes nitrogen derived from the atmosphere and develops an extensive network of mucilage-secreting aerial roots that harbors a diazotrophic (N2-fixing) microbiota. Targeting these diazotrophs, we selected nearly 600 microbes of a collection obtained from mucilage and confirmed their ability to incorporate heavy nitrogen (15N2) metabolites in vitro. Sequencing their genomes and conducting comparative bioinformatic analyses showed that these genomes had substantial phylogenetic diversity. We examined each diazotroph genome for the presence of nif genes essential to nitrogen fixation (nifHDKENB) and carbohydrate utilization genes relevant to the mucilage polysaccharide digestion. These analyses identified diazotrophs that possessed the canonical nif gene operons, as well as many other operon configurations with concomitant fixation and release of >700 different 15N labeled metabolites. We further demonstrated that many diazotrophs possessed alternative nif gene operons and confirmed their genomic potential to derive chemical energy from mucilage polysaccharide to fuel nitrogen fixation. These results confirm that some diazotrophic bacteria associated with Sierra Mixe maize were capable of incorporating atmospheric nitrogen into their small molecule extracellular metabolites through multiple nif gene configurations while others were able to fix nitrogen without the canonical (nifHDKENB) genes."

https://openalex.org/W3088798297,"The harvest of bushmeat is widespread in the tropics and sub-tropics. Often in these communities, there is a dependence on bushmeat for both food security and basic income. Despite the importance of bushmeat for households worldwide, the practice raises concern for transmission of zoonotic pathogens through hunting, food preparation, and consumption. In Uganda, harvest of wildlife is illegal, but bushmeat hunting, is commonplace. We interviewed 292 women who cook for their households and 180 self-identified hunters from 21 villages bordering Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda to gain insights into bushmeat preferences, opportunity for zoonotic pathogen transmission, and awareness of common wildlife-associated zoonoses. Both hunters and women who cook considered primates to be the most likely wildlife species to carry diseases humans can catch. Among common zoonotic pathogens, the greatest proportions of women who cook and hunters believed that pathogens causing stomach ache or diarrhea and monkeypox can be transmitted by wildlife. Neither women who cook nor hunters report being frequently injury during cooking, butchering, or hunting, and few report taking precautions while handling bushmeat. The majority of women who cook believe that hunters and dealers never or rarely disguise primate meat as another kind of meat in market, while the majority of hunters report that they usually disguise primate meat as another kind of meat. These data play a crucial role in our understanding of potential for exposure to and infection with zoonotic pathogens in the bushmeat trade. Expanding our knowledge of awareness, perceptions and risks enables us to identify opportunities to mitigate infections and injury risk and promote safe handling practices."
https://openalex.org/W3089499933,"Geohelminthiasis is a worldwide problem, especially in low-income countries. Children from rural areas and those living in poverty, lacking basic health amenities and having poor environmental sanitation are likely to be affected. Adverse effects such as anemia, protein malnutrition, colitis are common which can affect both the children's physical and mental growing development. A cross-sectional study on geohelminthiasis was conducted among children from 238 households in 13 villages in Kota Marudu of northern Sabah, East Malaysia. The study involved interviewing villagers using questionnaires to collect demographic and socio-economic data, getting faecal samples from the children, collecting soil samples and identifying parasite eggs with microscopy and molecular methods. A total of 407 children (6 months-17 years old) enrolled in the study. Geohelminthiasis was detected in the faecal samples of children from 54% (7/13) of the villages with mean prevalence of infection per village of 9.0% (0%-34.9%). On a household basis, 18% (43/238) of the households sampled had infected children, with mean prevalence rate per household of 11% (0%-43%). The prevalence was for Ascaris lumbricoides: 9.6% (39/407), Trichuris trichiura: 2.7% (11/407) and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma sp.): 2.7% (11/407). The overall mean infection rate of the children examined was 14.3%. Significantly higher prevalence was recorded for the children of mothers who did not have any formal education (p = 0.003); household income of less than USD119 (RM500) (p<0.001); children from homes without proper sanitation facilities (p<0.001); children who usually go about barefoot (p<0.001) and not washing feet before entering the house (p = 0.017). Soil samples were found to have geohelminth eggs or larvae which could be due to unhygienic sanitation practices. This study shows the geohelminthiasis is prevalent in the villages, and the risk factors are lack of maternal education, low income, poor sanitation facilities and irregular deworming practice. Expanding deworming coverage in the study region may help reduce the worm infections in these communities, so that the mental and physical development of the children would not be affected by geohelminthiasis. The data on the prevalence of geohelminthiasis in this study would contribute to better public health monitoring and operation to reduce the infection in rural areas."

Performance was measured by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD's) Health at a Glance indicators data framework (five dimensions with 57 indicators) and the United Nations' (UNs') Sustainability Development Goals (SDG) data set (15 indicators). Three country clusters emerged: Collective-Pyramidal (n = 9: comprising Slovak Republic, Mexico, Poland, Greece, Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Chile, and Slovenia); Collaborative-Networked (n = 12: UK, Canada, Australia, USA, Ireland, New Zealand, Netherlands, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden); and Orderly-Future Orientated (n = 14: Korea, Estonia, Latvia, Austria, Israel, Japan, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg and Switzerland). The Collaborative-Networked cluster had significantly better performing health systems measured by both the Health at a Glance and SDG performance data, followed by the Orderly-Future Orientated cluster, followed by the Collective-Pyramidal cluster. The Collaborative-Networked Cluster was characterized by low power distance (e.g., greater levels of equity), low uncertainty avoidance (e.g., toleration of others' opinions), individualism (e.g., self-reliance) and indulgence (e.g., drives and norms to enjoy life and have fun).National cultures are associated with healthcare performance on two key international measures. In national and international efforts to improve health system performance, cultural characteristics play an important role. This information may be of value to regulators, policymakers, researchers and clinicians examining the practical impact of culture on healthcare performance."
https://openalex.org/W3089713292,"Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) and hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV) belong to the genus Novirhabdovirus and are the causative agents of a serious disease in cultured flounder. However, infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), a prototype of the genus Novirhabdovirus, does not cause disease in flounder. To determine whether IHNV growth is restricted in flounder cells, we compared the growth of IHNV with that of VHSV and HIRRV in hirame natural embryo (HINAE) cells infected with novirhabdoviruses at 1 multiplicity of infection. Unexpectedly, we found that IHNV grew as well as VHSV and HIRRV. For successful growth in host cells, viruses modulate innate immune responses exerted by virus-infected cells. Our results suggest that IHNV, like VHSV and HIRRV, has evolved the ability to overcome the innate immune response of flounder cells. To determine the innate immune response genes of virus-infected HINAE cells which are commonly modulated by the three novirhabdoviruses, we infected HINAE cells with novirhabdoviruses at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 and performed an RNA sequencing-based transcriptome analysis at 24 h post-infection. We discovered ~12,500 unigenes altered by novirhabdovirus infection and found that many of these were involved in multiple cellular pathways. After novirhabdovirus infection, 170 genes involved in the innate immune response were differentially expressed compared to uninfected cells. Among them, 9 genes changed expression by more than 2-fold and were commonly modulated by all three novirhabdoviruses. Interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CXCR1), Toll/interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP), cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 11, duplicate 5 (CXCL11.5), and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) were up-regulated, whereas C-C motif chemokine receptor 6a (CCR6a), interleukin-12a (IL12a), and Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) were down-regulated. These genes have been reported to be involved in antiviral responses and, thus, their modulation may be critical for the growth of novirhabdovirus in flounder cells. This is the first report to identify innate immune response genes in flounder that are commonly modulated by IHNV, VHSV, and HIRRV. These data will provide new insights into how novirhabdoviruses survive the innate immune response of flounder cells."
https://openalex.org/W3090623685,"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a border or precursor state of dementia. To optimize implemented interventions for MCI, it is essential to clarify the underlying neural mechanisms. However, knowledge regarding the brain regions responsible for MCI is still limited. Here, we implemented the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test, a screening tool for MCI, in 20 healthy elderly participants (mean age, 67.5 years), and then recorded magnetoencephalograms (MEG) while they performed a visual sequential memory task. In the task, each participant memorized the four possible directions of seven sequentially presented arrow images. Recall accuracy for beginning items of the memory sequence was significantly positively related with MoCA score. Meanwhile, MEG revealed stronger alpha-band (8-13 Hz) rhythm desynchronization bilaterally in the precuneus (PCu) for higher MoCA (normal) participants. Most importantly, this PCu desynchronization response weakened in correspondence with lower MoCA score during the beginning of sequential memory encoding, a time period that should rely on working memory and be affected by declined cognitive function. Our results suggest that deactivation of the PCu is associated with early MCI, and corroborate pathophysiological findings based on post-mortem tissue which have implicated hypoperfusion of the PCu in early stages of Alzheimer disease. Our results indicate the possibility that cognitive decline can be detected early and non-invasively by monitoring PCu activity with electrophysiological methods."
https://openalex.org/W3091449879,"Background & aims Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) is an infection in patients with cirrhosis and carries significant mortality. The management of SBP is evolving with the rise of multidrug resistant organisms. Our aim was to perform a retrospective analysis to determine if identification of bacteria in culture could aid in prognosis and provide information regarding optimal treatment. Methods We analyzed our 10-year experience of SBP in a single academic center (Northwestern Memorial Hospital). We obtained information regarding SBP prophylaxis, culture data and resistance patterns of bacteria, choice/duration of inpatient antibiotics, and key laboratory measurements and determined outcomes including mortality, hospital duration, and ICU stay. Results Patients with SBP had a 17.8% mortality and had culture positive SBP 34.4% of the time. Antimicrobial resistance was seen in 21.3% of cases and trended towards worsening mortality, with worsened mortality associated with first line use of piperacillin-tazobactam (p = 0.0001). Patients on SBP prophylaxis who developed SBP had improved mortality (p<0.0001) unless there was a positive culture, in which case patients had worsened mortality (p = 0.019). Patient with a higher PMN counts after repeat paracentesis had higher mortality (p = 0.02). Conclusions Our results show that SBP continues to be a morbid and deadly condition and identification of an organism is key in treatment. The standard initial antibiotic for SBP may need to be modified to reflect emerging resistant pathogens and gram-positive organisms. Further, antibiotic prophylaxis should be utilized only in select cases to prevent development of resistance."
https://openalex.org/W3090246803,"Two systems of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), noncleavable H32-DM1 and cleavable H32-VCMMAE, were developed by using different linkers and drugs attached to the anti-HER2 antibody H32, which is capable of cell internalization. Activated functional groups, including an N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) ester and a maleimide, were utilized to make the ADCs. Mass spectrometry, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and in vitro cell assays were performed to analyze and optimize the ADCs. Several H32-VCMMAE ADCs were established with higher DARs and greater synthetic yields without compromising potency. The anticancer efficacy of H32-DM1 was 2- to 8-fold greater than that of Kadcyla®. The efficacy of H32-VCMMAE was in turn better than that of H32-DM1. The anticancer efficacy of these ADCs against N87, SK-BR-3 and BT474 cells was in the following order: H32-VCMMAE series > H32-DM1 series > Kadcyla®. The optimal DAR for H32-VCMMAE was found to be 6.6, with desirable attributes including good cell penetration, a releasable payload in cancer cells, and high potency. Our results demonstrated the potential of H32-VCMMAE as a good ADC candidate."
https://openalex.org/W3090629016,"Infection prevention and speaking up on errors are core qualities of health care providers. Heuristic effects (e.g. overconfidence) may impair behavior in daily routine, while speaking up can be inhibited by hierarchical barriers and medical team factors. Aim of this investigation was to determine, how medical students experience these difficulties for hand hygiene in daily routine.On the base of prior investigations we developed a questionnaire with 5-point Likert ordinal scaled items and free text entries. This was tested for validity and reliability (Cronbach's Alpha 0.89). Accredited German, Swiss and Austrian universities were contacted and medical students asked to participated in the anonymous online survey. Quantitative statistics used parametric and non-parametric tests and effect size calculations according to Lakens. Qualitative data was coded according to Janesick.1042 undergraduates of 12 universities participated. All rated their capabilities in hand hygiene and feedback reception higher than those of fellow students, nurses and physicians (p<0.001). Half of the participants rating themselves to be best educated, realized that faulty hand hygiene can be of lethal effect. Findings were independent from age, sex, academic course and university. Speaking-up in case of omitted hand hygiene was rated to be done seldomly and most rare on persons of higher hierarchic levels. Qualitative results of 164 entries showed four main themes: 1) Education methods in hand hygiene are insufficient, 2) Hierarchy barriers impair constructive work place culture 3) Hygiene and feedback are linked to medical ethics and 4) There is no consequence for breaking hygiene rules.Although partially limited by the selection bias, this study confirms the overconfidence-effects demonstrated in post-graduates in other settings and different professions. The independence from study progress suggests, that the effect occurs before start of the academic course with need for educational intervention at the very beginning. Qualitative data showed that used methods are insufficient and contradictory work place behavior in hospitals are frustrating. Even 20 years after ""To err is human"", work place culture still is far away from the desirable."
https://openalex.org/W3091180911,"Phedimus takesimensis (Ulleungdo flat-leaved stonecrop) is endemic to Ulleung and Dokdo Islands off the east coast of the Korean Peninsula. It was suggested that P. takesimensis originated via anagenetic speciation from the continental progenitor species P. kamtchaticus or P. aizoon. However, little is known of the phylogenetic relationships and population genetic structure among species of Phedimus in the Korean Peninsula and Ulleung/Dokdo Islands. We inferred the phylogenetic relationships among congeneric species in Korea based on nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and chloroplast noncoding regions. We also sampled extensively for P. takesimensis on Ulleung Island and the continental species, P. kamtschaticus and P. aizoon, to assess the genetic consequences of anagenetic speciation. We found (1) the monophyly of P. takesimensis, (2) no apparent reduction in genetic diversity in anagenetically derived P. takesimensis compared to the continental progenitor species, (3) apparent population genetic structuring of P. takesimensis, and (4) two separate colonization events for the origin of the Dokdo Island population. This study contributes to our understanding of the genetic consequences of anagenetic speciation on Ulleung Island."
https://openalex.org/W3091631671,"The obesity epidemic has influenced pain rehabilitation clinics. To date, little is known about baseline level of physical activity (PA) in patients referred to pain rehabilitation clinics. We aimed to investigate the PA levels of patients referred to pain rehabilitation clinics and to evaluate the effect of excess weight on PA level.Data were obtained from the Swedish Quality Registry for Pain Rehabilitation between 2016 and 2017. These data included PA time (everyday PA and physical exercise per week), Body Mass Index (BMI), sociodemographic factors, chronic pain and psychological aspects (e.g., pain intensity, depressive and anxiety symptoms and insomnia problems). Insufficient PA was defined as less than 150 minutes per week. We performed logistic regressions as well as orthogonal partial least square regression to estimate the effects of excess weight on PA. Over one-fourth of the patients were classified as obese (BMI ≥30 kg/m2, 871/3110, 25.3%) and nearly one-third of these patients were classified as severely obese (BMI ≥35 kg/m2, 242/871, 27.8%). Time estimations for physical exercise varied among the BMI groups, but patients in the higher BMI category were more likely to spend less time on everyday PA. Compared to normal weight, mild obesity [odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.81] and severe obesity (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.74) were associated with less PA. Mild obese patients had an elevated risk of 65% and severe obese patients had an elevated risk of 96% for insufficient PA. Increased pain intensity was positively related to insufficient PA (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06-1.29) among the obese patients.Having low PA is very common for patients referred to pain rehabilitation clinics, especially for those with comorbid obesity. As a first step to increase PA, obese patients need to be encouraged to increase the intensity and amount of less painful daily PA."
https://openalex.org/W3091744706,"Past claims have been made for fossil DNA recovery from various organisms (bacteria, plants, insects and mammals, including humans) dating back in time from thousands to several million years BP. However, many of these recoveries, especially those described from million-year-old amber (fossil resin), have faced criticism as being the result of modern environmental contamination and for lack of reproducibility. Using modern genomic techniques, DNA can be obtained with confidence from a variety of substrates (e.g. bones, teeth, gum, museum specimens and fossil insects) of different ages, albeit always less than one million years BP, and results can also be obtained from much older materials using palaeoproteomics. Nevertheless, new attempts to determine if ancient DNA (aDNA) is present in insects preserved in 40 000-year old sub-fossilised resin, the precursor of amber, have been unsuccessful or not well documented. Resin-embedded specimens are therefore regarded as unsuitable for genetic studies. However, we demonstrate here, for the first time, that although a labile molecule, DNA is still present in platypodine beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) embedded in six-year-old and two-year-old resin pieces from Hymenaea verrucosa (Angiospermae: Fabaceae) collected in Madagascar. We describe an optimised method which meets all the requirements and precautions for aDNA experiments for our purpose: to explore the DNA preservation limits in resin. Our objective is far from starting an uncontrolled search for aDNA in amber as it was in the past, but to start resolving basic aspects from the DNA preservation in resin and search from the most modern samples to the ancient ones, step by step. We conclude that it is therefore possible to study genomics from resin-embedded organisms, although the time limits remain to be determined."

Materials and methods In this single-center, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled study, we performed a 1:1 random allocation on eligible patients with recurrent HCC after locoregional treatment, to receive TICW-RFA or SC-RFA. The primary endpoint was the minimum diameter of the ablation zone per unit ablation time. Secondary endpoints included other technical parameters, complication rate, technical success and technique efficacy, and clinical outcomes. Results Enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the TICW-RFA group (n = 40) or SC-RFA group (n = 37). The two groups did not show significant differences in the primary endpoint, the minimum diameter of the ablation zone per unit ablation time was 2.71 ± 0.98 mm/min and 2.61 ± 0.96 mm/min in the TICW-RFA and SC-RFA groups, respectively (p = 0.577). Total RF energy delivery (11.75 ± 9.04 kcal vs. 22.61 ± 12.98 kcal, p < 0.001) and energy delivery per unit time (0.81 ± 0.49 kcal/min vs. 1.45 ± 0.42 kcal/min, p < 0.001) of the TICW-RFA group were less than those of the SC-RFA group. No procedure-related death or major complications occurred. Technical success was achieved in all patients in both groups, and technique efficacy rates were 100% (46/46) in the TICW-RFA group and 95.0% (38/40) in the SC-RFA group (p = 0.213). The 1-year and 2-year cumulative LTP rates were 11.8% and 24.2%, respectively, in the TICW-RFA group, and 8.6% and 18.1%, respectively, in the SC-RFA group (p = 0.661). Conclusion In this single-center randomized controlled study from a Korean tertiary referral hospital, TICW-RFA demonstrated similar therapeutic efficacy and safety profile for recurrent HCC after locoregional treatment compared with SC-RFA.

https://openalex.org/W3090255592,"Exposure to lead (Pb) can have serious toxic effects on the physiological and biochemical processes of plants. The chemical form of the metal determines the degree of its toxicity. In our research, we examined the effect of lead in the form of lead nitrate [Pb(NO3)2] and lead chloride (PbCl2) in concentrations of 12.5 mM and 25 mM on pine (Pinus sylvestris) seed germination. Nitrogen salt causes more severe changes than chloride salt. Increasing levels of electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde, and hydrogen peroxide were detected during germination processes. The high levels of ROS lead to redox changes in the cell. We observed a reduction in the level of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), and at the same time observed increased levels of the oxidised form of glutathione (GSSG) depending on the concentration and also the time of exposure to lead compounds. At the beginning of germination processes, the effective non-enzymatic activity of the antioxidant cycle was dominant, and at the late stage the enzymatic activity was noticed in the presence of Pb compounds. CAT activity significantly increased after Pb compound exposition."
https://openalex.org/W3090397284,"The Performance of the Upper Limb (PUL) module is an externally-assessed clinical scale, initially designed for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy population. It provides an upper extremity functional score suitable for both weaker ambulatory and non-ambulatory phases up to the severely impaired patients. It is capable of characterizing overall progression and severity of disease and of tracking the stereotypical proximal-to-distal progressive loss of upper limb function in muscular dystrophy. Since the PUL module has been validated only with Duchenne patients, its use also for Becker and Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophy patients has been here evaluated, to verify its reliability and extend its use. In particular, two different assessors performed this scale on 32 dystrophic subjects in two consecutive days. The results showed that the PUL module has high reliability, both absolute and relative, based on the calculation of Pearson's r (0.9942), Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (0.9943), Standard Error of Measurement (1.36), Minimum Detectable Change (3.77), and Coefficient of Variation (3%). The Minimum Detectable Change, in particular, can be used in clinical trials to perform a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of the effects of interventions with the lapse of time. According to this analysis, an intervention is effective if the difference in the PUL score between subsequent evaluation points is equal or higher than 4 points; otherwise, the observed effect is not relevant. Inter-rater reliability with ten different assessors was evaluated, and it has been demonstrated that deviation from the mean is lower than calculated Minimum Detectable Change. The present work provides evidence that the PUL module is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring upper limb ability in people with different forms of muscular dystrophy. Therefore, the PUL module might be extended to other pathologies and reliably used in multicenter settings."
https://openalex.org/W3090612862,"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arboviral zoonosis that primarily affects ruminants but can also cause illness in humans. The increasing impact of RVF in Africa and Middle East and the risk of expansion to other areas such as Europe, where competent mosquitos are already established, require the implementation of efficient surveillance programs in animal populations. For that, it is pivotal to regularly assess the performance of existing diagnostic tests and to evaluate the capacity of veterinary labs of endemic and non-endemic countries to detect the infection in an accurate and timely manner. In this context, the animal virology network of the MediLabSecure project organized between October 2016 and March 2017 an external quality assessment (EQA) to evaluate the RVF diagnostic capacities of beneficiary veterinary labs. This EQA was conceived as the last step of a training curriculum that included 2 diagnostic workshops that were organized by INIA-CISA (Spain) in 2015 and 2016. Seventeen veterinary diagnostic labs from 17 countries in the Mediterranean and Black Sea regions participated in this EQA. The exercise consisted of two panels of samples for molecular and serological detection of the virus. The laboratories were also provided with positive controls and all the kits and reagents necessary to perform the recommended diagnostic techniques. All the labs were able to apply the different protocols and to provide the results on time. The performance was good in the molecular panel with 70.6% of participants reporting 100% correct results, and excellent in the serological panel with 100% correct results reported by 94.1% of the labs. This EQA provided a good overview of the RVFV diagnostic capacities of the involved labs and demonstrated that most of them were able to correctly identify the virus genome and antibodies in different animal samples."

The mechanism of the effects of attitude to behavior, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and punishment avoidance on expressway speeding behavior is analyzed. The results show that drivers lack a correct understanding of expressway speeding behavior and that punishment avoidance has a significant effect on expressway speeding behavior.

https://openalex.org/W3089372077,"The purpose of this research is to solve the problems of unreasonable layout of the production plant, disorder of the logistics process, and unbalanced production line in discrete manufacturing plants. By analyzing the production process and characteristics, the timed Petri net model is constructed according to the function and connection of each production unit, which is then used to generate a FlexSim simulation model of the production plant logistics system with a simulation software. Therewith the FlexSim simulation model is used to simulate the original layout of the plant, and to analyse the simulation data synthetically to put forward an improvement strategy. Combined with the use of the systematic layout planning method to analyze the overall layout of the plant and logistics relations, we infer the relevant drawings between the production units and determine the improved layout of the facilities. Finally, by comparing the before and after improvement simulation results, it is verified that the combination of timed Petri nets and systematic layout planning is effective to ameliorate the layout of the plant facilities and the logistics system. This method makes up for the factors that traditional methods have not considered, achieves the goal of reducing the cross circuitous route of the plant and the idle rate of equipment, and improving the efficiency of production."

We aimed to assess liver fibrosis degree with quantitative morphometric measurements of histopathological sections utilizing digital image analysis (DIA) and to further investigate if a correlation with histopathologic scoring (Scheuer staging) exists. A retrospective study of patients with at least two post-liver transplant biopsies having a Scheuer stage of ≤ 2 at baseline were gathered. Portal tract fibrotic percentage (%) and size (μm2) were measured by DIA, while clinical fibrosis score was measured by the Scheuer system. Correlations between DIA measurements and Scheuer scores were computed by Spearman correlation analysis. Differences between mean levels of fibrosis (score, size, and percentage) at baseline versus second visit were computed by Student’s t-test. P values < 0.05 were considered significant. Of 22 patients who met the study criteria, 54 biopsies were included for analysis. Average levels ±standard error [S.E.] of portal tract fibrotic percentage (%) and size (μm2) progressed from 46.5 ± 3.6% at baseline to 61.8 ± 3.8% at the second visit (P = 0.005 by Student’s t-test), and from 28,075 ± 3,232 μm2 at base line to 67,146 ± 10,639 μm2 at the second visit (P = 0.002 by Student’s t-test), respectively. Average levels of Scheuer fibrosis scores progressed from 0.55±0.19 at baseline to 1.14±0.26 at the second visit (P = 0.02 by Student’s t-test). Portal tract fibrotic percentage (%) and portal tract fibrotic size were directly correlated with clinical Scheuer fibrosis stage, with Spearman correlation coefficient and P value computed as r = 0.70, P < 0.0001 and r = 0.41, P = 0.002, respectively. Digital quantitative assessment of portal triad size and fibrosis percentage demonstrates a strong correlation with visually assessed histologic stage of liver fibrosis and complements the standard assessment for allograft monitoring, suggesting the utility of future WSI analysis."

Nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) containing three IGF-1 SNPs (rs6214, rs5742692, and rs35767), two AKT2 SNPs (rs892119 and rs35817154), two FOXO1 SNPs (rs17446593 and rs10507486), and two FOXO3 SNPs (rs9480865 and rs2153960) were genotyped in 472 unrelated elders with a mean age of 73.8 years. We observed significant interactions of IGF-1 SNP rs6214 and rs35767 with regular physical activity on TUG and GS; and AKT2 SNP rs892119 and FOXO3 SNP rs9480865 with regular physical activity on armGrip. Genotype GG of IGF-1 rs6214 and rs35767 in individuals without regular physical activity had poor performance in TUG and GS, as well as GG of AKT2 rs892119 decreased armGrip in individuals without regular physical activity. After FDR adjustment, no significant gene-gene interactions were found.

https://openalex.org/W3090641982,"Influenza A virus controls replication and transcription of its genome through the tight regulation of interaction between the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex subunits. The helical scaffold of RNP is maintained by nucleoprotein (NP). Previous studies have revealed that NP interacts with both PB2 N-terminal and C-terminal regions, with both regions sharing similar affinity to NP as revealed in co-immunoprecipitation assay. Our work here suggests that the interaction between NP and PB2 N-terminal region lies in the cap-binding domain (residue 320-483). By co-immunoprecipitation assay, the interaction was found to involve RNA. On the other hand, the cap-binding activity was not essential in the interaction. As shown by the NHS pull-down assay, a specific RNA sequence was not required. Among the cap-binding domain, residues K331 and R332 of PB2 play a role in RNP function so that polymerase activity was reduced when these residues were mutated, while K331 was found to be more crucial in the NP interaction. Collectively, our findings suggest a new binding mode between NP and PB2 which was mediated by RNA, and such interaction may provide a novel interacting site for influenza drug development."

In some countries such as Cuba, little is known about the within-state plant health system. To facilitate the development of future trade partnership between Cuba and the United States, agencies need to understand the organizational structure and diagnostic capacity of the Cuban Plant Protection System, identify potential synergies between the United States and Cuban systems, and identify steps towards cooperation. This paper fills this critical void by presenting a descriptive analysis of the plant health system in Cuba. Information was integrated from available literature, informal interviews with Cuban experts, and workshops focused on Cuban policies, risk, and potential collaboration attended by Cuban and American experts. We identify the next practical steps in improving cooperation, including building trust and capacity. Mutual understanding of phytosanitary systems will be crucial for the regional economic and environmental stability of a post-embargo United States-Cuban relationship."

We combined targeted DNA- and genome-wide RNA-sequencing to identify genetic variants and gene expression signatures respectively from patients with HNSCC including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCC). DNA and RNA were purified from 35- formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) HNSCC tumor samples. Immuno-histochemical evaluation of tumors was performed to determine the expression levels of p16INK4A and classified tumor samples either p16+ or p16-. Using ClearSeq Comprehensive Cancer panel, we examined the distribution of somatic mutations. Somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were called using GATK-Mutect2 (""tumor-only"" mode) approach. Using RNA-seq, we identified a catalog of 1,044 and 8 genes as significantly expressed between p16+ and p16-, respectively at FDR 0.05 (5%) and 0.1 (10%). The clinicopathological characteristics of the patients including anatomical site, smoking and survival were analyzed when comparing p16+ and p16- tumors. The majority of tumors (65%) were p16+. Population sequence variant databases, including gnomAD, ExAC, COSMIC and dbSNP, were used to identify the mutational landscape of somatic sequence variants within sequenced genes. Hierarchical clustering of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) samples based on HPV-status was observed using differentially expressed genes. Using RNA-seq in parallel with targeted DNA-seq, we identified mutational and gene expression signatures characteristic of p16+ and p16- HNSCC. Our gene signatures are consistent with previously published data including TCGA and support the need to further explore the biologic relevance of these alterations in HNSCC."
https://openalex.org/W3090070394,"The increasing number of fraudulent pesticides on the market not only constitutes a major threat to sustainable agriculture but can also have adverse consequences for the environment and human health. The purpose of this study is to assess farmers' risk perception with regard to fraudulent pesticides and to establish the determinants of their perception. Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 370 farmers from the eastern region in Saudi Arabia. The findings showed that farmers had a high perception of physical, legal, social, and physiological risks of counterfeit pesticides, while they had a moderate perception of agri-environmental risks (M = 3.47, SD = 0.72) and economic risks (M = 3.52, SD = 1.11). Moreover, 73.5% of farmers reported that they had purchased fraudulent pesticides in the last three years. The results of the t-test revealed that the number of farmers who had purchased fraudulent pesticides was significantly higher than the number of farmers who had not purchased such pesticides regarding the perception of the majority of risks, except for physical risk. Multivariate regression analyses showed that age, farm size, farming experience, extension contact, and purchased fraudulent pesticides were significantly associated with risk perception. The findings suggest that awareness campaigns on recognizing fraudulent pesticides among farmers are needed, as well as policy measures, to combat counterfeiting in the agricultural sector in cooperation with other stakeholders."

We conducted a respondent-driven sampling biobehavioral survey in Juba of female sex workers (FSW) aged ≥15 years who sold or exchanged sex in the last 6 months to learn more about this population. We enrolled 838 FSW from November 2015 to March 2016 and estimated HIV prevalence to be 37.8%. Prevalence of active syphilis was 7.3%. FSW were from South Sudan and most neighboring countries. Comprehensive knowledge of HIV was 11.1% and 64.2% of FSW had never spoken with an outreach worker. In multivariable analysis, HIV was associated with being from Uganda (aOR: 3.3, 95% CI: 1.7-6.1) or Kenya (aOR: 4.3, 95% CI: 1.5-13.0) versus from South Sudan. Our survey suggests that FSW may play a critical role in South Sudan's HIV epidemic and highlights the importance of tailoring services to the unique needs of FSW of all nationalities in Juba."
https://openalex.org/W3090422877,"Hydra are freshwater polyps widely studied for their amazing regenerative capacity, adult stem cell populations, low senescence and value as ecotoxicological marker. Many wild-type strains of H. vulgaris have been collected worldwide and maintained effectively under laboratory conditions by asexual reproduction, while stable transgenic lines have been continuously produced since 2006. Efforts are now needed to ensure the genetic characterization of all these strains, which despite similar morphologies, show significant variability in their response to gene expression silencing procedures, pharmacological treatments or environmental conditions. Here, we established a rapid and reliable procedure at the single polyp level to produce via PCR amplification of three distinct microsatellite sequences molecular signatures that distinguish between Hydra strains and species. The TG-rich region of an uncharacterized gene (ms-c25145) helps to distinguish between Eurasian H. vulgaris-Pallas strains (Hm-105, Basel1, Basel2 and reg-16), between Eurasian and North American H. vulgaris strains (H. carnea, AEP), and between the H. vulgaris and H. oligactis species. The AT-rich microsatellite sequences located in the AIP gene (Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Interaction Protein, ms-AIP) also differ between Eurasian and North American H. vulgaris strains. Finally, the AT-rich microsatellite located in the Myb-Like cyclin D-binding transcription factor1 gene (ms-DMTF1) gene helps to distinguish certain transgenic AEP lines. This study shows that the analysis of microsatellite sequences, which is capable of tracing genomic variations between closely related lineages of Hydra, provides a sensitive and robust tool for characterizing the Hydra strains."
https://openalex.org/W3089802004,"Quantitative assessments of the capacity of marine reserves to restore historical fish body-size distributions require extensive repeated sampling to map the phenotypic responses of target populations to protection. However, the ""no take"" status of marine reserves oftentimes precludes repeated sampling within their borders and, as a result, our current understanding of the capacity of marine reserves to restore historical body-size distributions remains almost entirely reliant on independent, static visual surveys. To overcome this challenge, we promote the application of a traditional fisheries tool known as a ""back-calculation"", which allows for the estimation of fish body lengths from otolith annuli distances. This practical application was pursued in this study, using data collected in five marine reserves and adjacent fished reefs in the Philippines, to investigate spatiotemporal disparities in length-at-age of the brown surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus. The spatial component of our analyses revealed that 1) A. nigrofuscus were phenotypically similar between marine reserves and fished reefs during their early life history; 2) marine reserve and fished reef populations diverged into significantly different length-at-age morphs between ages three and six, in which protected fish were predominantly larger than conspecifics in fished reefs; and 3) A. nigrofuscus returned to a state of general phenotypic similarity during later life. The temporal component of our analyses revealed that younger generations of A. nigrofuscus exhibited significant, positive year effects that were maintained until age eight, indicating that, within the significant age cohorts, younger generations were significantly larger than older generations."
https://openalex.org/W3091010109,"The aim of this study was to compare 4 different ARV regimens in a clinical cohort in Brazil, with regard to the virologic and immunologic responses, clinical failure and reasons for changing. To compare the virologic response and clinical failure between groups we used the Cox and Kaplan Meier proportional hazard models. To analyze the immunologic outcome, we used multilevel GLLAMM and mixed effect linear regression models. To compare regimen change outcomes we used the Pearson's chi-square test. We included 840 participants distributed across the groups according to the initial ART regimen. The mean follow-up period was 27.8 months. Almost half the sample initiated ART with AIDS-related signs/symptoms. Virologic response was effective in 79.6% of participants within 12 months. The tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz group presented a higher proportion of virologic response (VL<50 at 6 months) when compared to the zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz group. There was no difference between the regimens regarding the immunologic response. A total of 17.3% of individuals changed regimen because of failure and 46.5% due to adverse events. Changes due to adverse events were more frequent in the group using zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz. The proportion of hospitalizations at 1 year was higher in the zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz group when compared to the tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz group. The effectiveness outcomes between the regimens were similar. Some differences may be due to the individual characteristics of patients, toxicity and acceptability of drugs. Studies are needed that compare similarly effective regimens and their respective treatment costs and financial impacts on SUS (Integrated Healthcare System)."
https://openalex.org/W3091057102,"In our clinic, a substantial number of patients present with transtibial residual limb pain of no specific somatic origin. Silicone liner induced tissue compression may reduce blood flow, possibly causing residual limb pain. Thus, as a first step we investigated if the liner itself has an effect on transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2).Persons with unilateral transtibial amputation and residual limb pain of unknown origin were included. Medical history, including residual limb pain, was recorded, and the SF-36 administered. Resting TcPO2 levels were measured in the supine position and without a liner at 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes using two sensors: one placed in the Transverse plane over the tip of the Tibia End (= TTE), the other placed in the Sagittal plane, distally over the Peroneal Compartment (= SPC). Measurements were repeated with specially prepared liners avoiding additional pressure due to sensor placement. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS.Twenty persons (9 women, 11 men) with a mean age of 68.65 years (range 47-86 years) participated. The transtibial amputation occurred on average 43 months prior to study entry (range 3-119 months). With liner wear, both sensors measured TcPO2 levels that were significantly lower than those measured without a liner (TTE: p < 0.001; SPC: p = 0.002) after 10, 20 and 30 minutes. No significant differences were found between TcPO2 levels over time between the sensors. There were no significant associations between TcPO2 levels and pain, smoking status, age, duration of daily liner use, mobility level, and revision history.Resting TcPO2 levels decreased significantly while wearing a liner alone, without a prosthetic socket. Further studies are required to investigate the effect of liner wear on exercise TcPO2 levels."
https://openalex.org/W3091301100,"Chemotherapy response remains unpredictable in most patients with cancer. In this study, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 79 cancer xenografts derived from human cancer tissues to identify genetic predictors of chemosensitivity to nine cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Xenografts were harvested from 12 organs with cancer and implanted into nude mice. The mice were exposed to one of nine cytotoxic anticancer drugs (5-fluorouracil, nimustine, adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, mitomycin C, methotrexate, vincristine, and vinblastine) to assess the correlation between chemosensitivity response and variant allele frequency. We found 162 candidate variants that were possibly associated with chemosensitivity to one or more of the nine anticancer drugs (P < 0.01). In a subgroup analysis of breast and gastric cancer xenografts, 78 and 67 variants, respectively, were possibly associated with chemosensitivity. This approach may help to contribute to the development of personalized treatments that may allow for the prescription of optimal chemotherapy regimens among patients with cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3090577386,"Network pharmacology and polypharmacology are emerging as novel drug discovery paradigms. The many discovery, safety and regulatory issues they raise may become tractable with polypharmacological combinations of natural compounds found in whole extracts of edible and mixes thereof. The primary goal of this work is to get general insights underlying the innocuity and the emergence of beneficial and toxic activities of combinations of many compounds in general and of edibles in particular. A simplified model of compounds’ interactions with an organism and of their desired and undesired effects is constructed by considering the departure from equilibrium of interconnected biological features. This model allows to compute the scaling of the probability of significant effects relative to nutritional diversity, organism complexity and synergy resulting from mixing compounds and edibles. It allows also to characterize massive indirect perturbation mode of action drugs as a potential novel multi-compound-multi-target pharmaceutical class, coined Ediceuticals when based on edibles. Their mode of action may readily target differentially organisms’ system robustness as such based on differential complexity for discovering nearly certainly safe novel antimicrobials, antiviral and anti-cancer treatments. This very general model provides also a theoretical framework to several pharmaceutical and nutritional observations. In particular, it characterizes two classes of undesirable effects of drugs, and may question the interpretation of undesirable effects in healthy subjects. It also formalizes nutritional diversity as such as a novel statistical supra-chemical parameter that may contribute to guide nutritional health intervention. Finally, it is to be noted that a similar formalism may be further applicable to model whole ecosystems in general."
https://openalex.org/W3090639120,"People with special needs have high unmet oral healthcare needs, partly because dentists find it difficult to access their oral cavity. The Oral Accessibility Spatula aims to improve oral accessibility. This prospective multicenter interventional open-label non-randomized patient-self-controlled trial assessed the ability of the spatula to improve the oral accessibility of special-needs patients during dental examinations.The cohort was a convenience sample of minor and adult patients with special needs due to physical, intellectual, and/or behavioral disorders who underwent dental check-up/treatment in five French tertiary hospitals/private clinics in 2016-2018 and evinced some (Venham-Score = 2-4) but not complete (Venham-Score = 5) resistance to oral examination. After inclusion, patients underwent oral examination without the spatula and then immediately thereafter oral examination with the spatula. Primary outcome was Oral Accessibility Score (0-12 points; higher scores indicate visualization and probing of the tooth sectors). Secondary outcomes were patient toleration (change in Venham-Score relative to first examination), safety, and Examiner Satisfaction Score (0-10; low scores indicate unsatisfactory examination).The 201 patients were mostly non-elderly adults (18-64 years, 65%) but also included children (21%), adolescents (11%), and aged patients (3%). One-quarter, half, and one-quarter had Venham-Score = 2, 3, and 4 at inclusion, respectively. The spatula significantly improved Oral Accessibility Score (4.8 to 10.8), Venham-Score (3.1 to 2.6), and Examiner Satisfaction Score (3.4 to 7.2) (all p<0.001). There were no severe spatula-related adverse events.The spatula significantly improved oral access, was safe and well-tolerated by the patients, and markedly improved oral examination quality."
