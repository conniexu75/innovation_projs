https://openalex.org/W1610204701,"The acute response of steroidogenic cells to trophic hormone stimulation is the mobilization of cholesterol from cellular stores to the mitochondrial outer membrane and the transfer of this cholesterol to the mitochondrial inner membrane where the first enzymatic step in steroidogenesis occurs. The transfer of cholesterol across the mitochondrial membranes is dependent upon de novo protein synthesis, and this is the regulated step in the process. Although the newly synthesized regulatory protein(s) have yet to be identified, we previously have proposed a candidate protein which we identified in MA-10 cells that is synthesized in response to luteinizing hormone stimulation and that is localized to the mitochondria. In the present study, we report the isolation of a cDNA that encodes this luteinizing hormone-induced protein. Analysis of the cDNA and protein sequences reveals this is a novel protein. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that expression of the protein in MA-10 cells in the absence of hormone stimulation is sufficient to induce steroid production. We conclude that this protein is required in the acute regulation of steroidogenesis and propose to call this protein the Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein (StAR)."
https://openalex.org/W2016868037,"Nuclear orpan receptors are members of the superfamily of structurally related, ligand-inducible transcription factors for which no ligand has yet been identified. Over the past few years many nuclear orphan receptors have been cloned, but only for the retinoid X receptor (RXR) has a natural ligand (9-cis-retinoic acid) been found. Here we report the identification of melatonin as a ligand for the recently cloned orphan receptor retinoid Z receptor beta (RZR beta). We found RZR beta expression in the rat brain nearly coincident with binding sites for the pineal gland hormone melatonin (5-methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine). We show here binding and activation of RZR beta by melatonin with Kd and EC50 values in the low nanomolar range. A nuclear signaling pathway for melatonin may contribute to some of the diverse and profound effects of this hormone, for example, in the context of circadian rhythmicity."
https://openalex.org/W1554666404,"Human cytomegalovirus infects epithelial, smooth muscle, and white blood cells in vivo causing acute, latent, and chronic infections. A data base search revealed that the amino acid sequence of the putative protein encoded by open reading frame US28 of human cytomegalovirus is approximately 30% identical to those of the mammalian leukocyte receptors for alpha and beta chemokines. This suggested that US28 was originally copied from a human chemokine receptor gene, perhaps to provide the virus with a selective advantage through molecular mimicry. Chemokines regulate the trafficking and activation of mammalian leukocytes and activate calcium-mobilizing, heptahelical, G protein-coupled receptors. We now show that US28 encodes a promiscuous calcium-mobilizing receptor for the beta chemokines RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, but not for the alpha chemokines interleukin-8 or gamma IP10. The chemokine selectivity of the US28 product is distinct from that of known mammalian beta chemokine receptors. This finding suggests a role for beta chemokines in the pathogenesis of human cytomegalovirus infection by transmembrane signaling via the product of US28."
https://openalex.org/W1496221368,"Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) is a ubiquitous second messenger in eukaryotic cells that triggers Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Three types of InsP3 receptors have been identified in mammals. The three receptor types are encoded by homologous genes and are structurally similar, suggesting two alternative hypotheses about the biological significance of multiple InsP3 receptors: (a) the different InsP3 receptors could have similar functions as InsP3-gated Ca2+ channels, and the presence of multiple genes could then serve as a mechanism to allow tissue-specific differential expression of receptors; or (b) the different receptors are co-expressed in cells but have distinct biological roles in these cells. To test these hypothesis, we have investigated the similarities and differences between the expression, alternative splicing, and ligand binding of different receptors. Our results demonstrate co-expression of different InsP3 receptors in almost all tissues and cell lines tested. Although all receptor types exhibit a similar specificity for inositol phosphates, the different receptors have different affinities for InsP3, with a relative order of affinities of type II > type I > type III. These findings suggest that the presence of multiple InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ pools with differential responsiveness to InsP3 may be a general property of all cells mediated by the presence of multiple types of InsP3 receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1503503847,"The major proteinaceous component of amyloid deposits associated with Alzheimer's disease is a self-assembling 40-42-residue peptide, known as A beta, which is generated by the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (Kang, J., Lemaire, H. G., Unterbeck, A., Salbaum, J. M., Masters, C. L., Grzeschik, K. H., Multhaup, G., Beyreuther, K., and Muller-Hill, B. (1987) Nature 325, 733-736; Haass, C., Hung, A. Y., Schlossmacher, M. G., Oltersdorf, T., Teplow, D. B., and Selkoe, D. J. (1993) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 695, 109-116; Estus, S., Golde, T. E., and Younkin S. G. (1992) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 674, 138-148) and is implicated as one of the causal factors in the pathology of the disease. A beta is now shown to display properties commonly associated with surfactants or detergents, which form micelles in solution. Increasing concentrations of A beta lower the surface tension of water up to a critical concentration, above which little further decrease in surface tension is observed. At concentrations above this critical concentration, increasing amounts of non-covalent aggregates of A beta are observed. A beta aggregation is also correlated with the formation of a hydrophobic environment that excludes water. The extent of this hydrophobic environment, as reflected by the partitioning of hydrophobic fluorescent probes, is much higher for the longer A beta 1-42 isoform, which may be more intimately associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology than A beta 1-40. Although the solution structure of A beta is not yet known, these results suggest that the structure of A beta has the same type of axial amphipathic organization as detergent molecules and that the same principles that govern micelle formation may also apply to A beta aggregation and amyloid fibril self-assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1556535974,"The binding of a new calcium sensitizer, levosimendan, to human cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is described. Fluorescence studies done on dansylated recombinant human cTnC and a site-directed mutant showed that levosimendan modulated the calcium-induced conformational change in cTnC, and revealed the role of Asp-88 in the binding of the drug to the NH2-terminal domain of cTnC. Furthermore, NMR studies performed on the NH2-terminal fragment of cTnC showed a spatial proximity between levosimendan and Met81, Met85, and Phe77 in the drug-protein complex. These data were used to build an optimized model of the drug-protein complex, in which levosimendan binds cTnC at the hydrophobic pocket of the NH2-terminal domain. The role of the binding of levosimendan to cTnC in the pharmacological action of this drug in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1483911606,"This manuscript examines the mechanisms by which Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaM-kinase IV) is activated through the binding of Ca2+/CaM and by phosphorylation. Studies with the synthetic autoinhibitory domain peptides of CaM-kinase II indicate that CaM-kinase IV has a similarly located autoinhibitory domain, and this was confirmed since site-directed mutagenesis of this region (HMDT308 to DEDD and FN317 to DD) generated fully active Ca2+/CaM-independent kinases. Total activities of purified, baculovirus-expressed wild type and mutant kinases were increased 2-fold by intramolecular autophosphorylation, but this reaction was extremely slow (1-2 h) and probably not physiological. However, CaM-kinase IV can be activated by brain CaM-kinase IV kinase resulting in large increases in both total (5-7-fold) and Ca2+/CaM-independent (> 20-fold) CaM-kinase IV activities. This activation reaction required Mg2+/ATP and Ca2+/CaM, was intermolecularly catalyzed, and was reversed by protein phosphatase 2A. Activation of CaM-kinase IV resulted in a 10-fold decrease in Km for syntide-2 with little effect on Km for ATP or Vmax. CaM-kinase IV kinase was highly purified from rat brain extract and was shown to be a 68-kDa monomer. The results of this study demonstrate that CaM-kinase IV does have an autoinhibitory domain within residues His305-Lys321 that suppresses kinase activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM. CaM-kinase IV is not significantly activated by autophosphorylation, but it can be activated 10-fold by a CaM-kinase IV kinase. This kinase cascade activation mechanism may be important for the physiological function of CaM-kinase IV such as transcriptional regulation through phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (Enslen, H., Sun, P., Brickey, D., Soderling, S. H., Klamo, E., and Soderling, T.R. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15520-15527)."
https://openalex.org/W1495083108,"Type XII and XIV collagens are very large molecules containing three extended globular domains derived from the amino terminus of each alpha chain and an interrupted triple helix. Both collagens are genetically and immunologically unique and have distinct distributions in many tissues. These collagens localize near the surface of banded collagen fibrils. The function of the molecules is unknown. We have prepared a mixture of native type XII and XIV collagens that is free of contaminating proteins by electrophoretic criteria. In addition, we have purified the collagenase-resistant globular domains of type XII or XIV collagens (XII-NC-3 or XIV-NC-3). In this study, we have investigated the effect of intact type XII and XIV and XII-NC-3 or XIV-NC-3 on the interactions between fibroblasts and type I collagen fibrils. We find that both type XII and XIV collagens promote collagen gel contraction mediated by fibroblasts, even in the absence of serum. The activity is present in the NC-3 domains. The effect is dose-dependent and is inhibited by denaturation. The effect of type XII NC-3 is inhibited by the addition of anti-XII antiserum. To elucidate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, we examined the effect of XII-NC-3 or XIV-NC-3 on deformability of collagen gels by centrifugal force. XII-NC-3 or XIV-NC-3 markedly promotes gel compression after centrifugation. The effect is also inhibited by denaturation, and the activity of type XII-NC3 is inhibited by the addition of anti-XII antiserum. The results indicate that the effect of XII-NC-3 or XIV-NC-3 on collagen gel contraction by fibroblasts is not due to activation of cellular events but rather results from the increase in mobility of hydrated collagen fibrils within the gel. These studies suggest that collagen types XII and XIV may modulate the biomechanical properties of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1605120960,"A nuclear 42-kDa 5'-->3'-exonuclease, DNase IV, was found previously in animal tissues. The enzyme has been purified from HeLa cells and shown to possess two catalytic properties characteristic of the 5'-nuclease function of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I,-DNase IV removes single-stranded 5' regions from splayed-arm DNA structures by endonucleolytic incision at the bifurcation point and possesses RNase H activity. Determination of the molecular masses of tryptic and V8 peptides of DNase IV by mass spectrometry identified the enzyme as the human homolog of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rad2 protein. The protein sequence retains conserved residues and shows significant homology to the sequences of the 5'-nuclease domain of E. coli DNA polymerase I and related microbial enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1517924874,"The cell-free immune repertoire of honeybees (Apis mellifera) consists of four polypeptides that are induced by bacterial infection and, through complementarity, provide broad-spectrum antibacterial defense. apidaecin is overproduced by a combination of low threshold transcriptional activation and a unique, genetically encoded amplification mechanism. In contrast, sizable experimental infections are required for induction of the normally silent hymenoptaecin, abaecin, and bee defensin genes; even so, bee defensin transcription is minimal and delayed, and only minute quantities of corresponding peptide are produced. The specific, temporal organization of the multi-component immune response in bees has therefore likely been selected to cope with infection of prevalent, plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria. Post-translational processing and modifications are substantially different for each of the four antibacterial peptides. While no similarities were observed among precursor structures of the various bee peptides, surprisingly, the signal sequences of abaecin (bee) and drosocin (Drosophila) shared unmistakable homology, possibly indicating common ancestral secretion/processing mechanisms. Finally, we report that bee defensin contains a typical structure (40 amino acids) but also a unique, amphipathic, putatively amidated carboxyl-terminal tail (10 amino acids). We speculate that this structure is a co-drug, assembled by fusing disulfide-rich and alpha-helical class peptide antibiotics, a novel concept in naturally occurring antibacterials."
https://openalex.org/W1525008978,"The transcription factor NFATp, which has a central role in cytokine gene induction in T cells, was previously thought to be expressed only in T cells and other immune cells. Here we report that NFATp is also expressed in the rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line and in the murine nervous system. Antisera against T cell NFATp recognize proteins of similar apparent molecular weight in T cells, PC12 cells, and murine olfactory bulb. The immunoreactive proteins from PC12 cells and from olfactory bulb bind to an NFAT site of the murine interleukin-2 promoter with the same specificity as T cell NFATp. Immunohistochemical staining localizes NFATp to neurons, specifically to olfactory receptor neurons and to their terminals in the olfactory bulb. The presence of NFATp in the nervous system suggests that it has a role in the transcription of specific neuronal genes in response to increases in cytosolic calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1541817349,"Microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP) is an integral component of microfibrillar structures that play a critical role in the organization of elastic fibers in the extracellular matrix. To study possible molecular interactions between MAGP and other elastic fiber components, we have generated native MAGP using a baculovirus expression system and tested its ability to associate with tropoelastin and fibrillin. MAGP produced by SF9 cells underwent processing similar to the mammalian protein, including correct cleavage of the signal peptide and sulfation of tyrosine residues. When tested in solid-phase binding assays, native MAGP specifically bound to tropoelastin but not fibrillin-1. Binding to tropoelastin was divalent cation-independent and was completely blocked by reduction and alkylation of either protein. Antibody inhibition studies indicated that the carboxyl terminus of tropoelastin mediated its interaction with MAGP. In addition to binding to elastin, MAGP was also a substrate for transglutaminase, which might explain its propensity to form high molecular weight aggregates that cannot be dissociated with reduction or denaturation. Together, the results of this study provide new insights into the functional relationship between microfibrillar proteins and have important implications for understanding elastic fiber assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1504159440,"The receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP mu comprises an extracellular segment containing a MAM domain, an immunoglobulin domain and four fibronectin type III repeats, a transmembrane segment, and two intracellular PTP domains. We have previously shown that PTP mu binds homophilically, i.e. PTP mu on the surface of one cell binds to PTP mu on an apposing cell, and that the extracellular segment alone is sufficient for homophilic binding. In this study we report that in MvLu cells PTP mu is proteolytically processed into two noncovalently associated fragments, one comprising most of the extracellular segment (approximately 100 kDa) and the other containing predominantly the transmembrane and intracellular portions (approximately 100 kDa). We have also identified the homophilic binding site within the extracellular segment. We have generated, expressed, and purified various fragments of the extracellular segment of PTP mu and have used fluorescent beads (Covaspheres) coated with these fragments in three binding assays: (i) measurement of bead aggregation, (ii) binding of beads to surfaces of dishes coated with purified PTP mu, or (iii) binding to MvLu cells. Only beads coated with recombinant fragments that contained the immunoglobulin domain underwent aggregation or bound to surfaces displaying PTP mu, suggesting that neither the MAM domain nor the fibronectin type III repeats bound homophilically in these assays. The fragment containing the Ig domain alone bound as well as any other Ig domain-containing fragment, suggesting that the Ig domain is both necessary and sufficient for homophilic binding under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1523107744,"We have recently demonstrated that cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) serves as a second messenger for glucose-induced insulin secretion (Takasawa, S., Nata, K., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993) Science 259, 370-373) and that human leukocyte antigen CD38 has both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities (Takasawa, S., Tohgo, A., Noguchi, N., Koguma, T., Nata, K., Sugimoto, T., Yonekura, H., and Okamoto, H. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26052-26054). Although the amino acid sequence of Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase exhibits a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with that of CD38, the Aplysia enzyme shows only ADP-ribosyl cyclase but not cADPR hydrolase. In the present study, we introduced site-directed mutations to CD38 and found that C119K- and/or C201E-CD38 exhibited only ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. Furthermore, Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase into which we introduced the mutations K95C and E176C, which correspond to residues 119 and 201 of human CD38, exhibited not only ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity but also cADPR hydrolase. These results indicate that cysteine residues 119 and 201 in CD38 have crucial roles in the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR."
https://openalex.org/W1571935242,"We isolated the rabbit gene for the 92-kDa matrix metalloproteinase, gelatinase B, and sequenced 1802 contiguous bases covering the first three exons and 522 bases of DNA upstream of the start site for transcription. The DNA between bases -519 and +19 is sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene in early passage cultures of corneal fibroblasts or primary cultures of corneal epithelial cells. Basal activity of the gelatinase B promoter in fibroblasts is lower than a collagenase promotor of 1800 base pairs, but activity of both promotors is similarly stimulated by treatment of transfected cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and stimulation is enhanced by co-treatment with transforming growth factor-beta. In contrast, basal activity of the gelatinase B promotor in epithelial cells is higher than the collagenase promotor. Deletion analysis demonstrated that sequences upstream of base -330 confer cell type-specific activity to the gelatinase B promotor. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that an AP1-like element within this region is specifically utilized by fibroblasts. This region also contains elements that confer the capacity for activation by AP2, a transcription factor found to be expressed by corneal epithelial cells but not by corneal fibroblasts. In contrast, AP2 does not activate the collagenase promotor. These results provide a molecular basis for the unique cell type-specific expression pattern of gelatinase B as compared to other matrix metalloproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W1521538332,"In mast cells, expression of interleukin-3 (IL-3) is induced following IgE-receptor activation via calcium-dependent mRNA stabilization. We performed a mutational analysis of the 8 AUUUA motifs located in the 3'-untranslated region of IL-3 mRNA, and analyzed the effect on mRNA stability in PB-3c mast cells. Similar to endogenous IL-3 mRNA, exogenous IL-3 transcripts had a short half-life and were stabilized following stimulation of calcium influx by ionomycin. Specific mutation of 3 AUUUA motifs had almost the same stabilizing effect as deletion of the entire AU-rich region. Mutating even a single critical motif led to a weak, but significant mRNA stabilization. Ionomycin treatment did not further enhance the expression of mutationally stabilized transcripts. Our data fit a model, where within a cluster of 6 AUUUA motifs, 3 adjacent motifs are required for binding of a factor which mediates rapid IL-3 mRNA decay. Activity of such a factor might be under control of a calcium-dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1519827104,"We have reconstituted the signal transduction system responsible for the negative regulation of the transcription of the Escherichia coli glnA gene, encoding glutamine synthetase, by glutamine. This signal transduction system consists of four proteins: the transcription factor NRI (NtrC), which activates glnA transcription when it is phosphorylated, the kinase/phosphatase protein NRII (NtrB) that directly controls the extent of NRI phosphorylation, the PII signal transduction protein that controls the phosphatase activity of NRII, and the uridylyltransferase/uridylyl-removing (UTase/UR) enzyme that is regulated by glutamine and controls the activity of PII. In the reconstituted system, the removal of uridylyl groups from the PII protein, catalyzed by the UTase/UR protein in the presence of glutamine, resulted in the stimulation of NRI approximately P dephosphorylation. In contrast, the uridylylated form of the PII protein had no discernible effect on NRI phosphorylation. The uridylylation of the trimeric PII protein by the monomeric UTase/UR protein is a non-cooperative reaction in which the partially modified species accumulated and were readily observed. Partially modified PII trimers were partially active in stimulating the dephosphorylation of NRI approximately P. Thus, both the PII-UTase/UR and PII-NRII interactions display the continuous variability characteristic of rheostats as opposed to the binary variability characteristic of toggle switches."
https://openalex.org/W1605302895,"Resting zone and growth zone (GC) costochondral chondrocytes constitutively release latent, but not active, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) into the culture medium. When exogenous TGF-beta is added to the culture medium, no autocrine effect is observed. However, when 1,25-(OH)2D3 is added, a dose-dependent inhibition of latent TGF-beta release is found. Messenger RNA levels for TGF-beta 1 are unchanged by treatment with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or TGF-beta 1. Since active growth factor was not observed in the conditioned medium, we tested the hypothesis that latent TGF-beta could be activated in the matrix. GC matrix vesicles, extracellular organelles associated with matrix calcification, were able to activate latent TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 when preincubated with 1,25-(OH)2D3. In contrast, GC plasma membranes activated latent TGF-beta, and addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited this activation. The 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent decrease in latent TGF-beta in the medium, with no detectable change in mRNA level, and the inhibition of plasma membrane activation of latent TGF-beta by 1,25-(OH)2D3 suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 may act through post-transcriptional and/or nongenomic mechanisms. The results also suggest that latent TGF-beta is activated in the matrix and that 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates this activation by a direct, nongenomic action on the matrix vesicle membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1582044781,"The RAD5 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions in postreplication repair of ultraviolet damaged DNA, and interestingly, it also has a role in increasing the instability of simple repetitive sequences in the genome. In contrast to DNA mismatch repair genes which function in maintaining constant length of repeat sequences, RAD5 promotes alterations in the length of repeat sequences. In this work, we purify the RAD5 protein to near homogeneity from yeast cells and show that it is a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. The possible roles of RAD5 ATPase in postreplication gap filling and in increasing the incidence of length alterations of repeat sequences are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1586171740,"The product of the c-mos proto-oncogene functions not only as an initiator of oocyte maturation but also as a component of cytostatic factor that causes the natural arrest of the unfertilized egg at the second meiotic metaphase. It has been shown that Mos can phosphorylate and activate mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase (MAPKK) in vitro, leading to activation of MAP kinase. In this study, by using an anti-MAPKK antibody that can specifically inhibit Xenopus MAPKK activity, we have shown that MAPKK mediates the cytostatic factor activity of Mos. Coinjection of this anti-MAPKK antibody with the bacterially expressed Mos protein into a two-cell embryo prevented the Mos-induced cleavage arrest as well as the Mos-induced MAP kinase activation. The analysis of individual embryos indicated that the degree of the cleavage arrest was correlated with the extent of the MAP kinase activation in the Mos- and the Mos/antibody-injected embryos. These observations suggest the involvement of a signal transmission pathway consisting of Mos, MAPKK, and MAP kinase in the metaphase arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1545820250,"An insulin response to glucose is required to correct hyperglycemia. Two proteins, the glucose transporter GLUT-2 and the glucose-phosphorylating enzyme glucokinase, have been implicated in the control of glucose metabolism in beta cells. To study the role of glucose transporter GLUT-2 in the regulation of insulin secretion and in the development of diabetes mellitus, we have obtained transgenic mice expressing high levels of GLUT-2 antisense RNA in beta cells. Western blot analysis showed an 80% reduction in GLUT-2 protein in the beta cells of these animals. Islets from transgenic mice showed impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. In addition, much higher levels of blood glucose were detected in transgenic mice than in controls when glucose tolerance tests were performed. These results suggest that the reduction of GLUT-2 in the pancreas could be a crucial step in the development of diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2281077886,"Escherichia coli strain AD93 is unable to synthesize the nonbilayer lipid phosphatidylethanolamine and requires high concentrations of specific divalent cations for growth. Previous studies suggested that in this strain, cardiolipin in combination with divalent cations functionally replaces phosphatidylethanolamine, reflecting polymorphic regulation of membrane lipid composition. However, it is also possible that divalent cations are required for regulation of lipid packing or membrane surface potential. 2H NMR was employed to measure the effect of different divalent cations on lipid packing in aqueous dispersions of lipid extracts isolated from AD93 and the wild type parental strain W3899, which were grown with [11,11-2H2]oleic acid. The results indicate that a range of acyl chain order is compatible with growth and that Ba2+, which cannot support growth of AD93, can increase chain packing to the wild type level. By means of microelectrophoresis, it was shown that the growth-promoting cations and Ba2+ have a strong and comparable ability to screen the surface charge of large unilamellar vesicles prepared from AD93 lipid extracts. Therefore, it is unlikely that the growth-promoting capacity of divalent cations is primarily due to their effect on lipid packing or their potency to decrease the surface potential. Furthermore, the addition of small amounts of Ba2+ to a AD93 lipid dispersion with excess Mg2+ diminished HII phase formation. This observation can explain the growth arrest in AD93 cultures upon the addition of Ba2+ and further supports the conclusion that the cation requirement of this strain arises mainly from polymorphic regulation of lipid composition."
https://openalex.org/W1592841312,"It has been suggested that the multifunctional protein, calreticulin, is a major calcium sequestering protein in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-containing endoplasmic reticulum subcompartment. In neuroblastoma X glioma NG-108-15 cells, bradykinin can effectively stimulate the release of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and cause a cytosolic calcium transient. To explore the function of calreticulin as an intracellular calcium sequestering protein, we investigated calcium dynamics in NG-108-15 cells after treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide against calreticulin, CrtAS1. Cells treated with either CrtAS1 or the corresponding sense oligonucleotide CrtPS1 were examined for their calreticulin content by Western blotting, the amplitude of their calcium transient in response to bradykinin, and their sensitivity toward the calcium ionophore, ionomycin. Treatment with CrtAS1 decreased the amount of calreticulin in comparison to CrtPS1-treated and untreated control cells. At the same time, CrtAS1-treated cells had a significantly reduced calcium response to bradykinin and were more sensitive to ionomycin-induced cell death. These data show that the level of calreticulin expression is directly related to the calcium storage capacity of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive calcium pool and indicate a direct relationship between the level of calreticulin and the protection against cytotoxic calcium overload."
https://openalex.org/W1494296538,"Abstract In the presence of plasma transglutaminase (factor XIIIa) fibrin first undergoes intermolecular covalent cross-linking between its gamma chains to create gamma dimers followed by slower cross-linking among its alpha chains to form alpha polymers. Progressive cross-linking of gamma chain dimers occurs at the slowest rate, resulting in gamma trimers and gamma tetramers (gamma multimers). Most studies indicate that cross-linked fibrin clots become resistant to fibrinolysis, but the basis for this event is not clear. In this study, we explored the role of gamma chain multimerization compared with alpha polymerization as causal factors in time-dependent development of resistance to fibrinolysis. Fibrin clots prepared from native (intact) fibrinogen were incubated for up to 120 h at near physiological ionic strength and a factor XIIIa level approximating that in plasma. These clots were lysed by plasmin at rates that were inversely proportional to the level of gamma multimers, which increased progressively with the time of incubation. In contrast, fibrin cross-linked at high ionic strength (a condition under which only gamma dimers and alpha polymers form) or fibrin formed in the absence of factor XIII showed no time-dependent decrease in lysis rates. Fibrin cross-linked for a fixed time period with increasing amounts of factor XIIIa contained gamma multimer levels that were proportional to the factor XIIIa concentration and lysed at rates that were inversely proportional to the gamma multimer level. Furthermore, cross-linked fibrin formed from fibrinogen fraction I-9, which has limited potential for alpha polymerization, showed the same reduction in the lysis rate as native cross-linked fibrin. These findings indicate that development of resistance to fibrinolysis of cross-linked fibrin is not measurably dependent upon gamma dimer or alpha polymer formation but develops solely as a function of gamma multimerization."
https://openalex.org/W1596574509,"Synaptotagmin I is a Ca2+/phospholipid binding protein of synaptic vesicles with a proposed function as a Ca2+ sensor in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Using controlled partial proteolysis as an assay, we now show that synaptotagmin I undergoes a conformational change as a function of Ca2+ binding. As observed for phospholipid binding, Ba2+ and Sr2+ but not Mg2+, substitute for Ca2+ in effecting this conformational change. The first C2 domain from synaptotagmin I that represents the Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding domain of synaptotagmin also undergoes a Ca(2+)-dependent change in controlled partial proteolysis. In contrast, no effect of Ca2+ was observed with mutant C2 domains containing point mutations that abolish Ca2+ binding. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of the effect of Ca2+ on proteolysis mirrors the Ca2+ dependence of phospholipid binding. The conformational shift in synaptotagmin I caused by Ca2+/phospholipid binding could be the basis for its Ca(2+)-regulated function in triggering neurotransmitter release."
https://openalex.org/W1483721930,"Microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) is extensively phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues, and such modifications affect various cellular processes, including microtubule dynamics. Although MAP-2 phosphorylation has been studied both in vitro and in vivo, nothing is known about the exact location of phosphorylated sites influencing the strength of MAP-2 binding to microtubules. Because the microtubule-binding region (MTBR) retains virtually all of the binding affinity of intact MAP-2 for microtubules, we focused on understanding the effect of protein kinase C phosphorylation on MTBR binding to taxol-stabilized microtubules. We used bacterially expressed MAP-2 MTBR, containing newly introduced CNBr-cleavable methionyl residues, as well as mass spectrometry and site-specific mutagenesis to locate and confirm assignments of critical phosphorylation sites. We report on the localization and role of phosphoryls on two specific residues (Ser-1703 and Ser-1711) in terms of kinase-mediated control of MTBR-stimulated tubulin polymerization. Ser-1703 is situated in the so-called first inter-repeat, and Ser-1711 is located in the second nonidentical repeat. Upon more extensive protein kinase C action, microtubule binding can be abolished by phosphorylation at Ser-1728, but this effect is conditionally dependent on the phosphorylation state at Ser-1703 and/or Ser-1711. Our results suggest that in vivo binding of MAP-2 to microtubules may be controlled by protein kinase C action at these residues, and the strategy presented in this report may facilitate future studies with other kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1533904683,"Liver-specific expression of the apolipoprotein AI (apoA-I) gene is controlled by the coordinate action of transcription factors bound to three sites (A, B, and C) located within a powerful liver-specific enhancer which spans the -222 to -110 region upstream of the apoA-I gene transcription start site (+1). Sites A and C bind various members of the nuclear receptor superfamily including the liver-enriched factor HNF-4. In the current report, enhancer derivatives with mutagenized protein-binding sites were tested for their ability to stimulate the apoA-I basal promoter in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells. The results revealed that occupation of both sites A and B, but not C is essential for high level expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that in HepG2 cells site B is occupied by the liver-enriched factor HNF-3 beta. Binding of HNF-3 beta to site B transactivates the apoA-I basal promoter in hepatic and nonhepatic cells. HNF-3 beta binding and transactivation were dependent upon the close proximity of two HNF-3 beta binding motifs within site B. Furthermore, HNF-3 beta and HNF-4, bound to their cognate sites within the apoA-I enhancer exhibited strong synergy in transactivation of the apoA-I basal promoter in nonhepatic cells, highlighting the central role of HNF-3 beta in liver-specific transcription of the apoA-I gene. It is concluded that cooperative binding of HNF-3 beta to site B and synergistic interactions between HNF-4 and HNF-3 beta bound to their cognate sites in the apoA-I enhancer may play a fundamental role in apoA-I gene expression in liver."
https://openalex.org/W1562817567,"The role of the NH2-terminal domain of the 20,000-dalton light chain on the regulatory function of smooth muscle myosin was studied by exchanging it in myosin with various mutant forms. The 10 S to 6 S conformational transition as well as the thick filament formation were significantly influenced by the deletion or substitution of the amino acid residues at the NH2-terminal side of the phosphorylation site (Ser19). Whereas the deletion of Ser1-Thr10 did not significantly affect these functions, further deletion of Lys11-Arg16 completely abolished the formation of 10 S conformation and induced thick filament formation. Among the residues in this region, Arg13 and Arg16 were most important for these functions since substitution of these residues by Glu or Ala significantly altered these functions. Similar substitutions of Lys11 and Lys12 also stabilized the 6 S conformation and thick filament formation but less effectively. While the 6 S conformation was stabilized, the deletion of NH2-terminal residues did not activate the actin-activated ATPase activity. This suggests that stabilization of the 6 S conformation is not directly coupled with activation of actomyosin ATPase activity but rather a more defined conformational change around the phosphorylation site is necessary for activation. Such a change also influences the 6 S to 10 S conformation and, therefore, the filament formation. To support this notion, substitution of Lys11 and Lys12 by Glu-Glu inhibited the phosphorylation-induced activation of actomyosin ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1569565880,"CD45 belongs to a family of high molecular mass leukocyte glycoproteins. It contains both an intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) activity and a cytoskeleton binding site in its cytoplasmic domain. Certain cytoskeletal proteins, such as fodrin (a spectrin-like molecule), are known to play an important role in the regulation of CD45's PTPase activity. In this study we mapped the fodrin binding domain of CD45 by deleting various portions of the cytoplasmic region, followed by the expression of these truncated cDNAs using an in vitro transcription/translation system. The results of these experiments indicate that the CD45 fodrin binding domain resides between amino acids 825 and 939. Construction of a fusion protein encoding the region between amino acids 825 and 939 shows that this particular sequence itself is sufficient for fodrin binding. Further analyses indicate that the sequence (930EENKKKNRN939S) in CD45 has good sequence homology with the spectrin binding domain found in the MSP1 glycoprotein of the malarial parasite. Biochemical studies, using binding competition assays, and a synthetic peptide containing the sequence 930EENKKKNRN939S, support the conclusion that the sequence between amino acids 930 and 939 is a critical part of CD45's fodrin binding domain. Further analyses indicate that this sequence is also involved in the fodrin-induced up-regulation of CD45 PTPase activity. Therefore, we suggest that fodrin binding to this domain is required for the onset of CD45-mediated signal transduction and leukocyte activation."
https://openalex.org/W1486444904,"In the presence of ATP, bovine brain hsp70 has been shown to remove clathrin from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles in a rapid stoichiometric initial burst followed by slow steady-state uncoating. In addition, it has been found recently that a 100-kDa cofactor is required for hsp70 to uncoat clathrin baskets prepared with the assembly protein AP-2. In this study the ATPase activity associated with uncoating was investigated, with baskets formed from clathrin and assembly proteins. Mixed assembly proteins or assembly protein AP-2 could not be used in ATPase studies because they activated the hsp70 ATPase activity even in the absence of clathrin. However, this was not the case with assembly protein AP180. A stoichiometric initial burst of ATP hydrolysis was found to accompany the initial burst of uncoating of AP180-clathrin baskets by hsp70, with 1 mol of hydrolyzed ATP/mol of released clathrin heavy chain. Furthermore, the presence of a 100-kDa cofactor was needed for both processes. These results suggest that an initial burst of uncoating occurs with all clathrin baskets, that an initial burst of ATP hydrolysis accompanies this initial burst of uncoating, and that a 100-kDa cofactor is required for both."
https://openalex.org/W1606294561,"Three natriuretic peptide receptors (the ANP-A, ANP-B, and clearance (C) receptors) have been reported. The regulation of these receptors by catecholamines was examined in cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Treatment with norepinephrine decreased the maximum 125I-ANP binding. The competitive binding assay with des[Gln18,Ser19,Gly20,Leu21, Gly22]ANP-(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANF-4-23), a specific ligand for the C receptor, revealed that the decrease in the 125I-ANP binding by norepinephrine was caused by the down-regulation of the C receptor. Isoproterenol also down-regulated the C receptor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The catecholamine-induced down-regulation of the C receptor was antagonized by a beta 2-selective adrenergic antagonist, ICI 118,551 but not by an alpha 1-, alpha 2-, or beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. Forskolin, NaF and, 8-bromo-cyclic AMP also decreased the C receptor density. The isoproterenol-induced decrease in the C receptor level was further confirmed by affinity cross-linking and Western blot analysis. Northern blot analysis revealed that isoproterenol and 8-bromo-cyclic AMP decreased the steady-state level of C receptor mRNA. By contrast, neither the ANP-A receptor nor the ANP-B receptor mRNA level was affected by 8-bromo-cyclic AMP. The nuclear run-on assay showed that the transcriptional rate of the C receptor gene was decreased by isoproterenol, whereas those of the ANP-A and ANP-B receptor genes were unchanged. Isoproterenol attenuated the clearance of exogenously added ANP and augmented the ANP-stimulated intracellular cyclic GMP production to the same extent as the selective occupancy of the C receptor with C-ANF-(4-23), suggesting that the isoproterenol-induced enhancement of responsiveness to ANP could result not from the sensitization of the ANP-A or ANP-B receptor but from the down-regulation of the C receptor, which leads to the attenuated clearance of ANP. These findings suggest that the beta 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation down-regulates the C receptor through the decrease in the transcriptional rate of the C receptor gene and that the activation of the sympathetic nervous system augments the biological responsiveness to natriuretic peptides by attenuating their metabolic clearance in vascular walls."
https://openalex.org/W1504793913,"The D1 reaction center protein in photosystem II (PSII) has a high turnover rate due to light-induced inactivation of the redox components. We have studied the reactivation kinetics of the redox components of PSII after strong illumination and compared these kinetics with the turnover of the D1 protein and translation kinetics of the plastid-encoded PSII core proteins in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells. Repair of PSII was to a large extent dependent on protein translation. During the first hours of repair, D1 translation was highly accelerated as compared to the other PSII core proteins. By addition of protein synthesis inhibitors during the recovery process, it was found that the time from protein synthesis to full reassembly and reactivation of the individual PSII complexes was about 55 +/- 10 min. Inactivation and reactivation of the redox components in PSII were followed by electron spin resonance and electron transport measurements. Combining the data shows that reactivation of the individual components proceeded together or shortly after one another. Thus, no accumulation of any partially active reactivation intermediate occurred. We conclude that the rate-limiting step of the repair cycle of PSII lies in the degradation and synthesis of the PSII reaction center proteins. Once stable synthesis of the PSII core proteins is achieved, reactivation of the redox components occurs very quickly."
https://openalex.org/W1567467136,"In order to investigate the role of lipid transfer protein (LTP) in plasma lipoprotein metabolism, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been raised against LTP isolated from rabbit plasma. mAbs 2-8G and 3-9F inhibited both [3H]cholesteryl ester (CE) and [3H]triglyceride (TG) transfer from low density lipoprotein (LDL) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) mediated by LTP. Although 3-9F cross-reacted with human LTP, 2-8G was species-specific for rabbit LTP. mAb 14-8H inhibited only [3H]TG but not [3H]CE transfer and was cross-reactive with human LTP. mAbs 2-8G and 3-9F interfered with association of LTP with lipid microemulsions, again 2-8G with species specificity, whereas 14-8H did not affect LTP-microemulsion binding. Thus, mAbs 3-9F and 14-8H were used for further study in human plasma. By total inhibition of CE and TG transfer by 3-9F, LTP was shown to be responsible for net mass transfer of neutral lipids between lipoprotein classes in plasma, namely of CE from HDL to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and TG from VLDL to LDL and HDL. Selective inhibition of TG transfer by mAb 14-8H was also able to inhibit such net neutral lipid transfer. Such effect of these antibodies was demonstrated more remarkably in the presence of cholesterol esterification. Thus, TG transfer activity of LTP was shown to be required for net CE transfer, suggesting that net neutral lipid transfer in plasma between lipoproteins occurred mainly by a hetero-exchange mechanism. Inhibition of net neutral lipid transfer in plasma did not affect cholesterol esterification occurring predominantly on HDL. Consequently, mAb inhibition of TG transfer in plasma leads to CE accumulation in HDL. It is possible that hyperalphalipoproteinemia may be induced by a mutation in LTP that causes a selective defect in TG transfer activity."
https://openalex.org/W1649718329,"We previously demonstrated that the 3.8-kilobase DNA fragment containing exons 4 and 5 of the human angiotensinogen (hAG) gene enhances the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, under control of the hAG promoter, in human hepatoma HepG2 cells. In the present study, to define regulatory elements of the hAG gene, we have functionally dissected this downstream region and localized a cell type-dependent enhancer to the 832-base pair sequence containing the exon 5 and 3'-flanking region. Further deletion analyses revealed that the 24-base pair core DNA fragment present in the 3'-flanking region was responsible for this enhancement. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the 3'-enhancer core element interacts specifically with two nuclear factors from the HepG2 cells, one of which is an uncharacterized factor (human angiotensinogen enhancer factor-1: hAEF-1), the other is an AP-3-related factor. Mutation analyses indicated that the disruption of hAEF-1 binding alone completely impaired the enhancer activity of the core element. These results suggested that the downstream enhancer core element interacting with hAEF-1 plays an important role in activating the angiotensinogen promoter in a cell type-dependent manner."

In contrast to eukaryotic proteins, which require a relatively reducing environment for optimal folding rates, both alkaline phosphatase and beta-lactamase fold fastest under very oxidizing conditions. For example, bovine pancreatic ribonuclease exhibits an optimal folding rate in a redox buffer consisting of 1 mM GSH and 0.2 mM GSSG (Lyles, M. M., and Gilbert, H. F.

https://openalex.org/W1497631048,"Estrone sulfate is the predominant form of estrogens found in the circulation in women and could thus serve as precursor for active estrogens in target tissues by removal of the sulfate group through the action of endogenous steroid sulfatase. Recently, we isolated a cDNA encoding human placental estrogen sulfotransferase that differs from brain aryl sulfotransferase only in the 5'-noncoding sequence. To increase our knowledge of the regulation and tissue-specific expression of sulfotransferase gene, we screened a lambda EMBL3 library of human leucocyte genomic DNA using the estrogen sulfotransferase cDNA as probe and isolated a clone containing almost the whole gene sequence. Sequencing of the gene indicates that it is included in approximately 7.7 kilobases and contains nine short exons separated by eight introns. The two first exons, named exon 1a and exon 1b, are noncoding and correspond to the 5'-untranslated sequences of human brain and human placental estrogen sulfotransferase cDNAs, respectively. Transfection of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene vectors containing the 5'-flanking sequence upstream from exon 1a and exon 1b in human adrenal adenocarcinoma cells indicates that both sequences possess promoter activity. The present results thus indicate that brain aryl sulfotransferase and placental human placental estrogen sulfotransferase mRNA species are transcribed from a single gene by alternate exon 1a and exon 1b promoters, respectively. Using DNA from panels of human/rodent somatic cell hybrids and amplification of the gene by polymerase chain reaction, the human placental estrogen sulfotransferase gene was assigned to chromosome 16."
https://openalex.org/W1508098315,"Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are vital components in the resistance of aerobic organisms to the toxicity of oxygen. Escherichia coli contains two highly homologous cytoplasmic SODs, a manganese- and an iron-containing enzyme (MnSOD, FeSOD). We previously demonstrated that MnSOD and FeSOD have different physiological functions and that MnSOD is more effective in preventing oxidative damage to DNA. In this report, purified E. coli MnSOD was shown to bind nonspecifically to DNA by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and nitrocellulose-filter binding methodologies. From electrophoretic mobility shift assay, the equilibrium dissociation constants for interaction with a variety of double-stranded and single-stranded oligonucleotides ranged from 1.5 +/- 0.2 to 8.4 +/- 1.3 microM at 20 degrees C. This range of concentrations corresponds to MnSOD concentrations in aerobically grown E. coli. In vivo binding of MnSOD to DNA was supported by colocalization of MnSOD and the E. coli nucleoid in immunoelectron microscopy. Both MnSOD and DNA were inhomogeneously distributed in the cytosol, the concentration of each being higher in the center of the cell and relatively low near the inner membrane. In contrast, there was no evidence for physiologically relevant interaction of FeSOD with DNA. Binding to DNA in vitro was weak, Kd > 40-220 microM, concentrations 7-40 times higher than found in vivo. In addition, the cytoplasmic distribution of FeSOD did not correlate with DNA. FeSOD concentration was higher near the inner membrane and lower in the center of the cytosol. These results demonstrate that E. coli MnSOD associates with DNA in vitro and in vivo. Combined with prior data demonstrating that MnSOD preferentially protects DNA in vivo while an equal enzymatic activity of FeSOD does not (Hopkin, K. A., Papazian, M. A., and Steinman, H. M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24253-24258), our data suggest that E. coli MnSOD acts as a tethered antioxidant; association of MnSOD with DNA localizes dismutase activity near a target of oxidative stress and increases protection of DNA from oxidative damage. This model has implications for the therapeutic use of SODs as antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W1537315161,"Biglycan is a small dermatan sulfate proteoglycan present in the extracellular matrix of a variety of connective tissues. Sedimentation velocity and equilibrium studies were carried out to determine the monomer molecular weight of biglycan in denaturing solvents and to define the oligomeric states of biglycan in physiologic solvents in the presence and absence of Zn2+. In 6 M guanidine chloride, biglycan is a monomer with s0(20,w) = 2.9 S and Mz = 93,100 (where Mz is z-average molecular weight). In 0.15 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, in the absence of divalent metal ions, and at concentrations above 1 mg/ml, biglycan is predominantly dimer (s0(20,w) = 4.8 S). Under these same conditions in solvent containing 5 mM Zn2+, biglycan exists predominantly as a hexamer, with s0(20,w) = 9.4 S and Mz approximately 600,000. In either case, the oligomers dissociate reversibly. In order to determine whether the glycosaminoglycan chains or the core protein was responsible for self-association, sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies were conducted on the isolated components. Dermatan sulfate chains prepared from biglycan, examined in both denaturing and physiologic solvents, show no significant difference in molecular weight (Mz approximately 22,000), whether or not the solvents contain Zn2+. However, biglycan core protein strongly self-associated in physiologic solvents. Thus, the self-association of biglycan appears to be mediated by the core protein and not by its glycosaminoglycan chains."
https://openalex.org/W1559099230,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify and characterize a novel 90 kDa protein that was specifically localized to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle. Biochemical experiments show that the 90 kDa protein is an integral membrane protein of the junctional face membrane and is a substrate for the intrinsic protein kinase in triads. Immunofluorescence staining of serial transverse sections of skeletal muscle with a monoclonal antibody to the 90 kDa protein showed preferential staining of type II fast fibers. Specific labeling was confined to the interphase between the A- and I-bands, where the triad structure is localized. Immunoelectron microscopical labeling further indicates that the 90 kDa protein, like the ryanodine receptor/Ca(2+)-release channel and triadin, is confined to the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Western blot analysis with a combination of monoclonal antibodies against the 90 kDa protein shows that it is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle but not in cardiac muscle or brain. Similarly, specific immunofluorescence labeling to the 90 kDa protein was not detected in ventricular myocytes or vascular smooth muscle cells. The junctional localization and phosphorylation of this protein suggest that it may play an important regulatory or structural role in the skeletal muscle triad junction."
https://openalex.org/W1529598744,"We describe the molecular components, subunit assembly, and cell surface expression of mu-chain complexes in mu+kappa- pre-B cell lines as revealed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The mu-chain complexes of these cell lines contain several previously unreported components, p42(6.4), p39(6.7), p18(8.6), and p14(7.0), in addition to lambda 5, VpreB1, VpreB3 (formerly named 8HS20), MB-1(Ig-alpha), and B29(Ig-beta). These new components are not detected in mu+kappa+ immature B cell lines. The mu-chain associates with lambda 5, VpreB3, and p56(5.0) at an early phase of assembly, preceding the association of other molecules. mu-Associated VpreB3 decreased during assembly as the association of VpreB1 became dominant, suggesting that the change in the ratio of these two VL-like surrogate light chains is involved in the mechanism of assembly. Lambda 5, VpreB1, p56(5.0), p32(5.0), p36(5.5), and p14(7.0) were shown to be expressed on the cell surface in association with mu-chain. The association of the other molecules with mu-chain is most likely restricted to the intracellular compartment. An interaction between VpreB1 and VpreB3 was also suggested. These findings might be important for understanding the function of mu-chain complexes in pre-B cells. A possible signaling mechanism of mu/surrogate light chain complexes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482388548,"The crucial process in the assembly of the L-A double-stranded RNA virus is the recognition of its (+) single-stranded RNA by the Gag-Pol protein. The Pol region of this protein has RNA binding activity and is necessary for RNA packaging. Here we show that there are actually two in vitro RNA-binding domains of Pol (residues 172-190 and 770-819), and both are necessary for viral propagation, (but not for particle assembly). Furthermore, the N-terminal RNA-binding domain is necessary for in vivo packaging of viral (+) single-stranded RNA. We precisely define the extent of the Pol packaging domain (residues 67-213), which includes the N-terminal RNA-binding domain. This suggests that the N-terminal RNA-binding domain is responsible for binding the genomic RNA in the process of packaging and that additional surrounding residues are responsible for the specificity of binding."
https://openalex.org/W1488876668,"The hypothalamic hormone, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), stimulates prolactin (PRL) secretion and gene transcription in the GH3 pituitary cell line. Several studies have provided indirect evidence that phosphorylation of the pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 may mediate TRH effects on PRL transcription. In the present study we have investigated the ability of TRH to alter the phosphorylation of Pit-1. In vivo 32P labeling experiments demonstrated that TRH stimulated a transient phosphorylation of Pit-1, reaching a maximum in 5 min and returning to basal levels within 30 min. Phosphopeptide mapping experiments demonstrated that TRH induced the transient phosphorylation of specific sites in Pit-1. TRH-stimulated phosphorylation of Pit-1 was blocked by treatments that deplete the cellular content of protein kinase C. Metabolic labeling and Western blot analysis demonstrate that TRH does not alter the total cellular content or nuclear concentration of Pit-1. TRH-mediated stimulation of a PRL promoter-luciferase fusion gene occurred under conditions that blocked the transient phosphorylation of Pit-1. These studies suggest that phosphorylation of Pit-1 may not be necessary for TRH mediated enhancement of PRL gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1612081295,"Physophilin is a 36-kDa polypeptide originally identified in synaptic plasma membrane fractions, which binds to synaptic vesicles and has been implicated in vesicle docking and/or exocytosis during neurotransmitter release. Here we report on the purification, amino acid sequence analysis, and subcellular localization of physophilin. Physophilin was enriched from detergent extracts of crude synaptic plasma membranes by a combination of cation exchange and lentil-lectin chromatography. Sequence analysis of peptides generated after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that physophilin is identical to the 39-kDa subunit (Ac39) of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. This was confirmed further by Western blot analysis with an Ac39-specific antiserum and by vesicle binding assays with recombinant Ac39 protein. Subcellular fractionation showed that Ac39 is enriched in synaptic vesicles, with lesser amounts being present in synaptic plasma membrane fractions. These results argue against a docking role of physophilin/Ac39 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis."

A 4-kb fragment, containing the SIS/PDGF-B promoter, was isolated from a human genomic library, and a series of 5'-nested deletions and linker-scanning mutants were used to identify positive regulatory elements that are necessary for the constitutive expression of this gene in human U2-OS osteosarcoma cells. A 250-bp fragment, lying immediately 5' to the SIS/PDGF-B mRNA initiation site (+1), retained full promoter activity, and positive regulatory elements at -228 to -219, -97 to -88 (SIS distal element) and -58 to -39 (SIS proximal element, SPE) were identified. Insertion of the 20-bp SPE into a heterologous, minimal promoter resulted in >5-fold transcriptional activation which was ablated by mutations to the SPE. High resolution mutagenesis within the 20-bp SPE, indicated the necessity of a CACCC motif for activity. Gel shift analysis of SPE-binding proteins in U2-OS nuclear extracts identified Sp1 and two additional binding factors that could be competed away from SPE binding by adding excess consensus Sp1 or CACC oligonucleotides. The individual and aggregate roles of the SPE and two weaker positive regulatory elements in regulating SIS/PDGF-B transcription in these tumor cells is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1548611486,"Abstract Recently, using a well defined nucleosomal assembly system, we demonstrated that high mobility group proteins (HMGs) 14 and 17 can organize nucleosomes into a regular array with a nucleosomal repeat length of 160-165 base pairs in vitro. Interestingly, such a short repeat length has been described for lower eukaryotes and for active chromatin. To begin to investigate how these proteins may prevent the close packing of nucleosomes, assembly reactions were carried out in which the relative amounts of HMGs 14 and 17, histones H2A and H2B, and the N1/N2.(H3, H4) complex were varied in assembly reactions. Under conditions in which histones H2A and H2B were limiting and in the absence of HMGs 14 and 17, micrococcal nuclease digestion of the assembled product produced a ladder of DNA fragments that was much less well defined and which included DNA that was associated with subnucleosomal structures. The apparent repeat length for this chromatin template was around 125 base pairs. Most interestingly, when HMGs 14 and 17 were added to this assembly reaction, nucleosome-like structures were reassembled as shown by the restoration of a regular, well defined ladder of DNA fragments upon micrococcal nuclease digestion. The apparent repeat length increased from 125 to approximately 145 base pairs. Analysis of the protein composition of chromatin formed in the presence or absence of HMGs 14 and 17 reveals that HMGs 14 and 17 might be able to substitute for a histone H2A-H2B dimer in a H2A/H2B-deficient nucleosome. The ability to form a regularly spaced nucleosomal template is also lost when excess HMGs 14 and 17 are used in assembly reactions. Spacing can be restored by the addition of poly(glutamate, alanine), a chemical polymer of negative charge, which may indicate that carrier proteins (specific or nonspecific) may be required for the proper incorporation of all chromatin assembly components into chromatin in vivo. Finally, although the mechanism of action is not known, HMGs 14 and 17 can partially overcome inhibition of initiation of transcription caused by the formation of nucleosomal particles deficient in histones H2A and H2B."
https://openalex.org/W1603131518,"The encephalomyocarditis virus 3C protease has been shown to be rapidly degraded in infected cells and in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. The in vitro degradation, at least, is accomplished by a virus-independent, ATP-dependent proteolytic system. Here we identify this proteolytic system as the ubiquitin-mediated system. Incubation of the 3C protease in rabbit reticulocyte or cultured mouse cell lysate preparations, alone or in the presence of added ubiquitin or methylated ubiquitin, resulted in the generation of new higher molecular weight species. These new products were shown to be 3C protease-ubiquitin conjugates by their ability to bind antibodies against both the 3C protease and ubiquitin. Supplemental ubiquitin also stimulated the degradation of the 3C protease in these preparations. Large 3C protease-polyubiquitin conjugates were observed to accumulate in reticulocyte lysate in the presence of adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), an inhibitor of the 26 S multicatalytic protease. This, combined with the fact that the proteolytic activity could be removed from the lysate by sedimentation, implicates the multicatalytic protease in the degradation of the 3C protease-ubiquitin conjugates. It was also found that the slow rate of degradation of a model polyprotein, which resembles the stable viral 3CD diprotein produced in vivo, is likely due to the fact that the polyprotein is a poor substrate for the ubiquitin-conjugating system."

The resulting stable cell line (Mev-SM) was able to grow in the absence of mevalonate. Analysis of Western blot showed that the new cell line strongly expressed mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase protein. Immunocytochemical studies using specific antibodies against mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase showed that the protein was located exclusively inside the mitochondria. The prototroph cell line Mev-SM can incorporate labeled acetate into cholesterol in the absence of mevalonate. These results show that the new cell line may circumvent the lack of cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase activity by producing cholesterol-convertible HMG-CoA inside the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1524090870,"Transcription of the adipocyte-specific adipsin gene is dramatically reduced in the adipose tissue of a number of genetically and chemically-induced obese rodents. To map the region of the adipsin gene that confers this response to obesity, transgenic mice were made containing -114, -250, -400, -700, and -938 base pairs (bp) to +35 bp of the promoter linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Transgenic mice containing as few as 114 bp of the adipsin promoter had high levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in adipose tissue. However, only those mice with 938 bp of the adipsin upstream regulatory region showed suppression of expression in adipose tissue in mice that were induced to become obese with monosodium glutamate. Using gel retardation assays, we showed that a 56-bp fragment of DNA mapping between -687 and -743 bp upstream from the start of adipsin expression was bound by protein factors in nuclear extracts prepared from adipose tissue. There was much greater retardation of this fragment with nuclear extracts prepared from adipose tissue of lean versus obese mice. These results indicate that a tissue-specific transcription factor(s) that regulates adipsin expression is less active in the adipose tissue of obese animals."

The conformational change is magnesium-specific, and magnesium can only be replaced by manganese. GTP, CaCl2, and NaCl have no effect. Magnesium, however has no effect on tryptophan accessibilities of tubulin-S. Implications of these results are discussed in terms of C-terminal tail-body interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1484846535,"Prior studies using the mutant thrombin, thrombin Quick I, indicate that this protease induces maximum platelet aggregation and intraplatelet [Ca2+] fluxes at agonist concentrations where dissociable, equilibrium platelet binding is undetectable and led to the conclusion that thrombin interaction with its platelet is best described kinetically by formation of an enzyme-substrate complex. This conclusion was substantiated further in the present studies by demonstrating that both thrombin Quick I and thrombin mimicked the thrombin receptor agonist peptide in the induction of the platelet activation-dependent events required for functional Prothrombinase assembly and that a rabbit antibody raised against KATNATLDPRSFLLR, a pentadecapeptide which represents amino acids 32-46 in the platelet thrombin receptor/substrate and spans the thrombin cleavage site, inhibited both thrombin- and thrombin Quick I-induced platelet activation responses equivalently. The antipeptide antibody had a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the rate of the thrombin-induced response rather than the magnitude of the response suggesting competition for the cleavage site, consistent with the observation that pretreatment of metabolically-inhibited platelets with thrombin, which was removed by washing, eliminated specific antibody binding due to removal and/or masking of antibody epitopes. Concentrations of the antipeptide antibody that inhibited thrombin- and thrombin Quick I-induced increases in intracellular [Ca2+] flux by as much as 97% did not alter the dissociable equilibrium binding of 125-I-FPR-thrombin to platelets. These combined data indicate that the hydrolytic event initiated by thrombin or thrombin Quick I interaction with the platelet receptor/substrate for thrombin is unrelated to the dissociable equilibrium binding of thrombin to membrane sites described previously by classical receptor-ligand binding analyses."
