https://openalex.org/W2019534906,"L-Dopa markedly increased the efflux of tritiated dopamine and tritiated serotonin from rat brain slices. This action appeared contingent on the decarboxylation of L-dopa to dopamine, since it could be blocked by an inhibitor of L-amino acid decarboxylase. Selective destruction of catecholamine-containing nerve terminals by 6-hydroxydopamine significantly decreased the uptake and release of tritiated dopamine but not that of tritiated serotonin. These observations support the hypothesis that a portion of exogenously administered L-dopa may enter central serotonin terminals and undergo decarboxylation to the amine with resultant displacement of the endogenous indoleamine from vesicular stores."

The structure was verified by spectral, gas chromatographic, and biological comparisons with the synthesized compound. Nine closely related isomers were considerably less effective."
https://openalex.org/W2036180582,"We have found recurrent chromosome breaks at a site (the ""fragile site"") on the long arm of chromosome 16. This site segregates in simple Mendelian dominant fashion in a large family. The distal portion of the chromosome sometimes shows selective endoreduplication. Preliminary linkage results reveal only 3 recombinants in 33 opportunities for recombination between the fragile site and the alpha locus of haptoglobin, an indication that the alpha-Hp gene is located near this region on chromosome 16."
https://openalex.org/W2031874112,Initially dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells derived from chick embryos differentiate sufficiently in tissue culture to form functional synaptic contacts. Spontaneous and evoked potentials recorded with intracellular microelectrodes resemble synaptic responses of adult spinal cord and neuromuscular junctions.

https://openalex.org/W2027789108,"A microscopic survey made to detect the presence of bacteria in hot springs of varying temperature and pH characteristics revealed that in neutral and alkaline hot springs bacteria are found at temperatures up to the boiling point of water (92 degrees to 100 degrees C, depending on the altitude). In hot springs of increasing acidity the upper temperature limit at which bacteria are found decreases; at pH 2 to 3 the upper temperature limit is 75 degrees to 80 degrees C. Bacteria have thus been able to evolve with the ability to grow at either high temperature or high acidity, but not at both high temperature and high acidity. These results suggest that there are physicochemical limitations of the environment beyond which life is impossible."
https://openalex.org/W1966285628,"Mueller-Lyer figures produced by lightness contrast (white on black) and by hue contrast in the absence of lightness contrast (red, yellow, green, or blue on gray) were presented to subjects aged nine to adult. Contrary to Piagetian expectations, the illusion magnitudes resulting from the colored figures did not decline with age."

https://openalex.org/W1979176324,"Vitamin B(6) deficiency was induced in pregnant rats with a deficient diet and with 4-deoxypyridoxine, a B(6) antagonist. Treated animals developed typical skin changes of B(6) deficiency. Fetuses were small and appeared anemic. Major fetal malformations were omphalocele, exencephaly, cleft palate, micrognathia, digital defects, and splenic hypoplasia. This teratologic system was developed as a model for human syndromes that exhibit combined immunologic and neurologic or skeletal defects."

https://openalex.org/W2026334675,"Sensory evaluation indicated that aspartylphenylalanine methyl ester is about 160 times sweeter than sucrose in aqueous solution. Blends of this dipeptide with (i) sodium saccharin, (ii) sodium saccharin and sucrose, and (iii) sodium saccharin, sucrose, and calcium cyclamate did not differ significantly from 4 or 12 percent sucrose in bitterness, off-flavors, or aftertaste."

https://openalex.org/W2068503925,"Rats were killed after intraventricular administration of [(3)H]leucine, and the turnover rates of total soluble proteins and of the brain specific S-100 protein were determined. The half-life of S-100 was estimated to be 16 days. The S-100 protein, thus, has a turnover not unlike that of the average water-soluble protein of brain."
https://openalex.org/W2082945213,"Fluorescence changes in squid axons were examined after staining with rhodamine B, pyronin B, or 8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate by intracellular application. Gradual changes in fluorescence were detected during both hyperpolarizing and depolarizing voltage-clamp pulses. Abrupt changes were often observed at the onset and at the end of voltage-clamp. Possible sources of artifact in optical measurements of this type and some implications of the findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1995129164,"Two lymphocytoid cell lines have been established from a patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The cells are deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, as demonstrated by their failure to incorporate [H3]hypoxanthine and by their inability to grow in medium in which they were nutritionally dependent upon exogenous hypoxanthine. This represents the first establishment of presumptively permanent human lymphocytoid cell lines that are deficient in a specific enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2091706180,"Phytoplankton samples collected in Monterey Bay, California, from 1955 to 1969 contained compounds identified as p,p′-DDT, p,p′-DDD, and p,p′-DDE. Total concentrations of these compounds were approximately three times greater in the later samples. Lower concentrations throughout the period were associated with higher densities of standing crop."
https://openalex.org/W1986591777,"Oxygen isotopic comparisons of phenotypes of Recent Planktonic Foraminifera with both normal and diminutive final chambers are compatible with a model in which the latter develop as a response to environmental stress. Isotopic evidence shows that Spheroidinella dehiscens is probably not a late-stage, aberrant form of Globogerinoides sacculifer."
https://openalex.org/W2077532097,"The presence of cortical spreading depression is typically inferred from the presence of hypesthesia. The electrocorticogram and slow-potential change were recorded during cortical spreading depression and it was found that hypesthesia remained long after the cortex recovered from neural depression. Hypesthesia, therefore, is an unreliable indicant of cortical spreading depression; if cortical spreading depression is used as a research tool, neural activity must be monitored. These data offer a special problem for memory transfer studies."

https://openalex.org/W1970048133,"Evidence indicates that the tooth surface differs in structure from the enamel immediately beneath it, and particularly that the enamel rod type structure is minimal in the true natural surface. Furthermore, the rod ends appear to disappear with age after the eruption of the tooth. The thickness of the surface layer may be as much as 25 micrometers. Studies of caries incidence show a peak in the attack curve 2 to 4 years after eruption and a decline thereafter for all teeth. This information indicates that the mechanical structure of the tooth surface should be carefully studied. A highly useful means appears to be ultrasound since the specific acoustic impedance of highly mineralized tissue like enamel is strongly dependent on fraction volume mineralization and since non-destructive test techniques can be based on ultrasonics. An experimental demonstration of ultrasonic detection in vitro of tooth surface demineralization is given."
https://openalex.org/W2097145786,Electrical activity from three neurons at a time was recorded in a pleural ganglion of Aplysia. Synchonous activity could be temporally patterned by electrical stimulation over a single nerve. After a period of pairing with electrical stimuli over another nerve the degree and time course of the synchrony were altered. Such alterations reverted after 5 to 30 minutes.

https://openalex.org/W1967338832,The metabolite 1-[1-(14)C]naphthyl glucuronide was isolated from mucosal and serosal fluids of everted sacs of rat small intestine incubated in media containing either the insecticide 1-[1-(14)C]naphthyl N-methylcarbamate (carbaryl) or 1-[1-(14)C]naphthol. The hydrolysis of carbaryl and conjugation of the liberated naphthol indicated some degree of metabolism by the intestine before absorption.

The hindgut of the nymphs is inhabited by the euglenoid only during the winter. Symbiotic associations involving green euglenoids and insects are virtually unknown.
