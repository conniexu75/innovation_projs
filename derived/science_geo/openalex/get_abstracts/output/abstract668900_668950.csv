https://openalex.org/W3130571400,"Public health measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission include masking in public places, physical distancing, staying home when ill, avoiding high-risk locations, using a contact tracing app, and being willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine. However, adoption of these measures varies greatly. We aimed to improve health messaging to increase adherence to public health behaviours to reduce COVID-19 transmission by: 1) determining attitudes towards public health measures and current behaviours; 2) identifying barriers to following public health measures; and, 3) identifying public health communication strategies. We recruited participants from a random panel of 3000 phone numbers across Alberta to fill a predetermined quota: age (18–29; 30–59; 60+ years), geographic location (urban; rural), and whether they had school-age children. Two researchers coded and themed all transcripts. We performed content analysis and in-depth thematic analysis. Nine focus groups were conducted with 2–8 participants/group in August-September, 2020. Several themes were identified: 1) importance of public health measures; 2) compliance with public health measures; 3) critiques of public health messaging; and 4) suggestions for improving public health messaging. Physical distancing and masking were seen as more important than using a contact tracing app. There were mixed views around willingness to take COVID-19 vaccine. Current public health messaging was perceived as conflicting. Participants felt that consistent messaging and using social media to reach younger people would be helpful. In conclusion, these findings provide insights that can be used to inform targeted (e.g., by age, current behaviour) public health communications to encourage behaviors that reduce COVID-19 transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3130722771,"The health risk of the coronavirus pandemic is age-specific. The symptoms of a COVID-19 infection are usually mild in the healthy population below the age of 65; however, the measures laid down to prevent the spread of the virus apply typically to the whole population. Hence, those who have a low risk of severe symptoms face a social dilemma in cooperating and complying with the safety measures: Cooperating in preventing the spread of the disease is good for society but comes with individual costs. These costs provide an incentive not to cooperate with the safety measures. In this paper we analyze via structural equation modelling a sample of young adults (N = 510) who were surveyed right after the end of the first lockdown period in Switzerland. We investigate why and to what extent they cooperated in preventing the epidemic by following the recommendation to stay at home as much as possible. We hypothesize that those respondents who perceive themselves to be personally at risk, or who have relatives belonging to the risk group, complied more often with the safety measures as compared to those without severe risks. Cooperating should also be linked to individuals’ pro-social orientation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that those who believe that the virus is dangerous for society or who have a personal interest in protection show higher support for the general safety measures. Our empirical results show that compliance with the coronavirus social distancing measures was generally very high during the first lockdown. Although young adults perceived themselves to be at low personal risk, they still believed that the virus is dangerous for society. Those who had a personal interest in staying at home because they had relatives belonging to the risk group complied more often with the safety measures. Overall, the results suggest that the support of the preventive measures is the most important promoter of cooperation to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3130233332,"Background Haloperidol, a widely used antipsychotic, has been suggested as potentially useful for patients with COVID-19 on the grounds of its in-vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, possibly through sigma-1 receptor antagonist effect. Methods We examined the associations of haloperidol use with intubation or death and time to discharge home among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) Greater Paris University hospitals. Study baseline was defined as the date of hospital admission. The primary endpoint was a composite of intubation or death and the secondary endpoint was discharge home among survivors in time-to-event analyses. In the primary analyses, we compared these two outcomes between patients receiving and not receiving haloperidol using univariate Cox regression models in matched analytic samples based on patient characteristics and other psychotropic medications. Sensitivity analyses included propensity score analyses with inverse probability weighting and multivariable Cox regression models. Results Of 15,121 adult inpatients with a positive COVID-19 PT-PCR test, 39 patients (0.03%) received haloperidol within the first 48 hours of admission. Over a mean follow-up of 13.8 days (SD = 17.9), 2,024 patients (13.4%) had a primary end-point event and 10,179 patients (77.6%) were discharged home at the time of study end on May 1 st . The primary endpoint occurred in 9 patients (23.1%) who received haloperidol and 2,015 patients (13.4%) who did not. The secondary endpoint of discharge home occurred in 16 patients (61.5%) who received haloperidol and 9,907 patients (85.8%) who did not. There were no significant associations between haloperidol use and the primary (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.39 to 1.62, p = 0.531) and secondary (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.74 to 2.28, p = 0.355) endpoints. Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Findings from this multicenter observational study suggest that haloperidol use prescribed at a mean dose of 4.5 mg per day (SD = 5.2) for a mean duration of 8.4 days (SD = 7.2) may not be associated with risk of intubation or death, or with time to discharge home, among adult patients hospitalized for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3130833971,"The quantum yield of a fluorophore is reduced when two or more identical fluorophores are in close proximity to each other. The study of protein folding or particle aggregation is can be done based on this above-mentioned phenomenon—called self-quenching. However, it is challenging to characterize the self-quenching of a fluorophore at high concentrations because of the inner filter effect, which involves depletion of excitation light and re-absorption of emission light. Herein, a novel method to directly evaluate the self-quenching behavior of fluorophores was developed. The evanescent field from an objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscope was used to reduce the path length of the excitation and emission light to ~100 nm, thereby supressing the inner filter effect. Fluorescence intensities of sulforhodamine B, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and calcein solutions with concentrations ranging from 1 μM to 50 mM were directly measured to evaluate the concentration required for 1000-fold degree of self-quenching and to examine the different mechanisms through which the fluorophores undergo self-quenching."
https://openalex.org/W3129699241,"Community face masking is possibly of great value in reducing COVID-19 transmission, especially when universally adopted with high compliance. The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, common misconceptions, barriers, and the compliance of the community with the use of face masks for the prevention of COVID-19. A validated questionnaire was administered to the participants through a web link by using various social media. The collected data were statistically analyzed for significant differences according to demographic variables. The average knowledge of face masks and their role in preventing COVID-19 transmission was 95.64%, with no differences among most of the demographical factors. Older groups and females demonstrated a better attitude towards wearing face masks than other groups did (p&lt;0.001). Another significant difference in the participant’s attitude was noticed between the various educational levels, employment, and nationality (p&lt;0.001). Of the total respondents, 88.2% encouraged wearing face masks. Misconceptions about wearing face masks were very low. The frequency of wearing face masks at public places, workplaces, or social gatherings was 87.2%, 80.5%, and 47.5% respectively. There was a significant variation in the compliance with wearing face masks between the various groups based on age, gender, nationality, and employment status (p&lt;0.001). The inconvenience in wearing face masks was reported by 36.3%. Face irritation and ear pain were reported by 70.2% and 43.5%, respectively. The inconvenience of wearing face masks with eyeglasses was reported by 44.3% of those wearing eyeglasses. In general, the study demonstrated a good attitude among participants towards wearing face masks. Although the respondents in the study were aware of the benefits of wearing face masks, the barriers may have decreased their desire to do so. These barriers include difficulty in breathing, discomfort, face irritation, and ear pain."
https://openalex.org/W3132262990,"Glutathione transferases (GSTs) constitute an ancient, ubiquitous, multi-functional antioxidant enzyme superfamily that has great importance on cellular detoxification against abiotic and biotic stresses as well as plant development and growth. The present study aimed to a comprehensive genome-wide identification and functional characterization of GST family in one of the economically important legume plants— Medicago truncatula . Here, we have identified a total of ninety-two putative MtGST genes that code for 120 proteins. All these members were classified into twelve classes based on their phylogenetic relationship and the presence of structural conserved domain/motif. Among them, 7 MtGST gene pairs were identified to have segmental duplication. Expression profiling of MtGST transcripts revealed their high level of organ/tissue-specific expression in most of the developmental stages and anatomical tissues. The transcripts of MtGSTU 5, MtGSTU 8, MtGSTU 17, MtGSTU 46, and MtGSTU 47 showed significant up-regulation in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. Moreover, transcripts of MtGSTU 8, MtGSTU 14, MtGSTU 28, MtGSTU 30, MtGSTU 34, MtGSTU 46 and MtGSTF 8 were found to be highly upregulated in response to drought treatment for 24h and 48h. Among the highly stress-responsive MtGST members, MtGSTU17 showed strong affinity towards its conventional substrates reduced glutathione (GSH) and 1‐chloro‐2,4‐dinitrobenzene (CDNB) with the lowest binding energy of—5.7 kcal/mol and -6.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the substrate-binding site residues of MtGSTU17 were found to be highly conserved. These findings will facilitate the further functional and evolutionary characterization of GST genes in Medicago ."
https://openalex.org/W3083313158,"In the framework of homogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models, we use a control theory approach to identify optimal pandemic mitigation strategies. We derive rather general conditions for reaching herd immunity while minimizing the costs incurred by the introduction of societal control measures (such as closing schools, social distancing, lockdowns, etc.), under the constraint that the infected fraction of the population does never exceed a certain maximum corresponding to public health system capacity. Optimality is derived and verified by variational and numerical methods for a number of model cost functions. The effects of immune response decay after recovery are taken into account and discussed in terms of the feasibility of strategies based on herd immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3132430747,"The aim of this study was to evaluate whether body composition, muscle function, and their association are predictive factors for short-term postoperative complications in patients with gastric and colorectal cancer. A prospective cohort study was conducted with patients undergoing resection of gastric and colorectal tumors. Nutritional status was assessed using Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) and anthropometric techniques. Low handgrip strength (HGS) was observed when &lt;16kg for women, and &lt;27kg for men. Computed tomography images were used to measure visceral adipose tissue, skeletal muscle index (SMI), and skeletal muscle radiodensity (SMD). Complications of grade II or above (according to Clavien-Dindo’s classification) were considered in a follow-up period of up to 30 days after surgery. Major complications were defined when they reached grade III or above. A total of 84 patients were analyzed (57.1% female, 59.7 ± 12.6 years) and 19% were diagnosed with low HGS + low SMI or SMD. Postoperative complications occurred in 51.2%, and these patients presented significantly longer duration of surgery and hospital stay. Major complications were observed in 16.7% of the total number of patients. Binary logistic regression adjusted by age, sex, and tumor staging showed that low SMD, low HGS + low SMI or SMD, and obesity were independent risk factors for postoperative complications, but only low SMD was an independent risk factor for major postoperative complications. Low SMD is an independent risk factor for short-term major complications following surgery in patients with gastric and colorectal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3132330155,"Insulin plays a major role in connecting nutrient availability to energy homeostasis by regulating metabolic pathways. Defects in insulin signalling is the primary cause for diabetes, obesity and various metabolic disorders. Nutritional status during growth and developmental stages play a crucial role in determining adult size, fecundity and ageing. However, the association between developmental nutrition and adult metabolic disorders has not been fully explored. Here, we address the effects of nutrient status during the larval growth phase on adult metabolism in Drosophila . We report that restricted food supply in larvae led to higher fat reserves and starvation resistance in mature adult flies, which we attribute to low insulin signalling. A lesser amount of stored fat was mobilised during early adult stages and during acute starvation, which accounts for the metabolic effects. Furthermore, larval diet influenced the expression of fat mobilisation genes brummer and lipid storage droplet-2 in adult flies, which led to the metabolic phenotypes reported here. Thus, the restricted nutrient environment in developing larvae led to adaptive changes that entrain the adult flies for scarce food availability."
https://openalex.org/W3131002444,"Among various delivery systems for vaccine and drug delivery, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been known as a potent delivery system because of their capability to penetrate cell membranes and deliver some types of cargoes into cells. Several CPPs were found in the proteome of viruses such as Tat originated from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), and VP22 derived from herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In the current study, a wide-range of CPPs was identified in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2, a new member of coronaviruses family, using in silico analyses. These CPPs may play a main role for high penetration of virus into cells and infection of host. At first, we submitted the proteome of SARS-CoV-2 to CellPPD web server that resulted in a huge number of CPPs with ten residues in length. Afterward, we submitted the predicted CPPs to C2Pred web server for evaluation of the probability of each peptide. Then, the uptake efficiency of each peptide was investigated using CPPred-RF and MLCPP web servers. Next, the physicochemical properties of the predicted CPPs including net charge, theoretical isoelectric point (pI), amphipathicity, molecular weight, and water solubility were calculated using protparam and pepcalc tools. In addition, the probability of membrane binding potential and cellular localization of each CPP were estimated by Boman index using APD3 web server, D factor, and TMHMM web server. On the other hand, the immunogenicity, toxicity, allergenicity, hemolytic potency, and half-life of CPPs were predicted using various web servers. Finally, the tertiary structure and the helical wheel projection of some CPPs were predicted by PEP-FOLD3 and Heliquest web servers, respectively. These CPPs were divided into: a) CPP containing tumor homing motif (RGD) and/or tumor penetrating motif (RXXR); b) CPP with the highest Boman index; c) CPP with high half-life (~100 hour) in mammalian cells, and d) CPP with +5.00 net charge. Based on the results, we found a large number of novel CPPs with various features. Some of these CPPs possess tumor-specific motifs which can be evaluated in cancer therapy. Furthermore, the novel and potent CPPs derived from SARS-CoV-2 may be used alone or conjugated to some sequences such as nuclear localization sequence (NLS) for vaccine and drug delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3132777870,"Brazil is the largest country in South America and the most genetically heterogeneous. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in Brazilian patients with breast cancer (BC) who underwent genetic counseling and genetic testing at a tertiary Oncology Center. We performed a retrospective analysis of the medical records of Brazilian patients with BC referred to genetic counseling and genetic testing between August 2017 and August 2019. A total of 224 unrelated patients were included in this study. Premenopausal women represented 68.7% of the cohort. The median age at BC diagnosis was 45 years. Multigene panel testing was performed in 219 patients, five patients performed single gene analysis or family variant testing. Forty-eight germline PVs distributed among 13 genes were detected in 20.5% of the patients (46/224). Eighty-five percent of the patients (91/224) fulfilled NCCN hereditary BC testing criteria. Among these patients, 23.5% harbored PVs (45/191). In the group of patients that did not meet NCCN criteria, PV detection rate was 3% (1/33). A total of 61% of the patients (28/46) harbored a PV in a high-penetrance BC gene: 19 (8.5%) BRCA1/2 , 8 (3.5%) TP53 , 1 (0.5%) PALB2 . Moderate penetrance genes ( ATM , CHEK2 ) represented 15.2% (7/46) of the positive results. PVs detection was statistically associated (p&lt;0.05) with BC diagnosis before age 45, high-grade tumors, bilateral BC, history of multiple primary cancers, and family history of pancreatic cancer. According to the current hereditary cancer guidelines, 17.4% (39/224) of the patients had actionable variants. Nine percent of the patients (20/224) had actionable variants in non- BRCA genes, it represented 43.5% of the positive results and 51.2% of the actionable variants. Considering the observed prevalence of PVs in actionable genes beyond BRCA1/2 (9%, 20/224), multigene panel testing may offer an effective first-tier diagnostic approach in this population."
https://openalex.org/W3129835455,"Contrary to the common expectation that the reference evapotranspiration (ET o ), which is an indicator of the atmospheric evaporation capability, increases in warming climate, the decline of the ET o has been reported worldwide, and this contradiction between the expected increasing ET o and the observed decreasing one is now termed the “evaporation paradox”. Based on the updated meteorological data (1960–2019), we separately detected the spatiotemporal characteristics and the causes of the “evaporation paradox” in three subregions, namely Huaibei, Jianghuai, and Sunan, and throughout the entire province of Jiangsu in southeastern China. Different from the reported continuous unidirectional variations in the ET o , in the province of Jiangsu, it generally showed a decreasing trend before 1990 but followed an increasing trend from 1990 to 2019, which led to the different characteristics of the “evaporation paradox” in the periods from 1960 to 1989, from 1990 to 2019, and from 1960 to 2019. In the first 30 years, the reduction of the wind speed (WS) was the main reason for the decreased ET o , which consequently gave rise to the “evaporation paradox” in spring and winter in the Huaibei region and only in winter in the two other subregions and throughout the entire province. We noticed that the “evaporation paradox” in spring in the Sunan region was expressed by the decreased daily mean air temperature ( T mean ) and the increased ET o which was chiefly induced by the decreased relative humidity (RH) and the increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD). After 1990, the decreased WS also dominated the decreased ET o and resulted in the “evaporation paradox” in winter in the Jianghuai region. Furthermore, the decreased sunshine hour (SH) was the main factor influencing the decreased ET o , thereby inducing the “evaporation paradox” in summer and autumn in the Jianghuai region and only in autumn in the Huaibei region and throughout the whole province from 1990 to 2019. In the whole study period from 1960 to 2019, the decreased SH was also found to be responsible for the decreased ET o and for the “evaporation paradox” in summer in all the subregions and throughout the whole province. However, regarding the “evaporation paradox” in autumn, in winter, and in the entire year in the Huaibei region and throughout the whole province, the observed decreased ET o was largely due to the reduced WS from 1960 to 2019. In summary, in addition to the air temperature, the ET o has shifted due to the other meteorological variables (especially the WS, the SH, and the VPD) and shaped the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of the “evaporation paradox” in the province of Jiangsu in southeastern China. Moreover, future studies and simulations addressing the regional climate change and hydrological cycles should take account of the changeable key meteorological variables in different subregions and seasons of the province of Jiangsu."
https://openalex.org/W3131724530,"Aim To determine whether healthcare workers (HCW) hospitalized in Spain due to COVID-19 have a worse prognosis than non-healthcare workers (NHCW). Methods Observational cohort study based on the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry, a nationwide registry that collects sociodemographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data on patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in Spain. Patients aged 20–65 years were selected. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to identify factors associated with mortality. Results As of 22 May 2020, 4393 patients were included, of whom 419 (9.5%) were HCW. Median (interquartile range) age of HCW was 52 (15) years and 62.4% were women. Prevalence of comorbidities and severe radiological findings upon admission were less frequent in HCW. There were no difference in need of respiratory support and admission to intensive care unit, but occurrence of sepsis and in-hospital mortality was lower in HCW (1.7% vs. 3.9%; p = 0.024 and 0.7% vs. 4.8%; p&lt;0.001 respectively). Age, male sex and comorbidity, were independently associated with higher in-hospital mortality and healthcare working with lower mortality (OR 0.211, 95%CI 0.067–0.667, p = 0.008). 30-days survival was higher in HCW (0.968 vs. 0.851 p&lt;0.001). Conclusions Hospitalized COVID-19 HCW had fewer comorbidities and a better prognosis than NHCW. Our results suggest that professional exposure to COVID-19 in HCW does not carry more clinical severity nor mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3127712874,"The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between physiological parameters (namely fatness and physical fitness) with academic performance (namely mathematics and science grade point average [GPA]) in normal weight and overweight schoolchild handball players. Thirty-six young male team handball players (age: 9±1 years; body mass: 45.5±14.2 kg; height: 1.38±9.1 m; body fat: 19.7±5.6%) at the highest national league for their age group participated. Anthropometry was examined by measuring body mass, body fat percentage (%BF), and body mass index (BMI). Fitness testing included the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test (level 1), squat jumps (SJ) and counter-movement jumps (CMJ), and upper-limb throwing performance (2 kg medicine ball seated front throw), a 15 m sprint test, and a T-half test for change-of-direction (COD) ability. Academic performance was evaluated through school records of grade point average (GPA) of mathematics and science. BMI was negatively correlated with science GPA (r = -0.57, p&lt;0.001) and mathematics GPA (r = -0.39, p&lt;0.001). Significant correlations between Yo-Yo test performance and science GPA (r = 0.73, p&lt;0.001) and mathematics GPA (r = 0.66, p&lt;0.001) existed. T-half test score (less time taken meant a superior performance) was negatively correlated with science GPA (r = 0.48, p = 0.003) and mathematics GPA (r = 0.63, p&lt;0.01). In conclusion, fatness and physical fitness (except for the upper-muscular strength) were significantly related to academic performance in in schoolchild handball players. Based on results of this study, it seems pragmatic and appropriate to engage young schoolchild in physical activity as it associates with superior academic performance."
https://openalex.org/W3129734862,"SARS-CoV-2 is the new coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 disease. The first two cases of COVID-19 were detected in Venezuela on March 13, 2020. The aim of this study was the genetic characterization of Venezuelan SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A total of 7 full SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were obtained by Sanger sequencing, from patients of different regions of Venezuela, mainly from the beginning of the epidemic. Ten out of 11 isolates (6 complete genomes and 4 partial spike genomic regions) belonged to lineage B, bearing the D614G mutation in the Spike protein. Isolates from the first outbreak that occurred in the Margarita Island harbored an in-frame deletion in its sequence, without amino acids 83–85 of the NSP1 of the ORF1. The search for deletions in 48,635 sequences showed that the NSP1 gene exhibit the highest frequency of deletions along the whole genome. Structural analysis suggests a change in the N-terminal domain with the presence of this deletion. In contrast, isolates circulating later in this island lacked the deletion, suggesting new introductions to the island after this first outbreak. In conclusion, a high diversity of SARS-CoV-2 isolates were found circulating in Venezuela, with predominance of the D614G mutation. The first small outbreak in Margarita Island seemed to be associated with a strain carrying a small deletion in the NSP1 protein, but these isolates do not seem to be responsible for the larger outbreak which started in July."
https://openalex.org/W3131469177,"Background Many types of intervention exist for suicide attempters, but they tend not to sufficiently consider patient’s views. Aim To identify useful components of a previously evaluated intervention after a suicide attempt from the patient’s views and to better understand the process of recovery. Method Forty-one interviews with suicide attempters were qualitatively analysed. Views of participants (i) on the components of the intervention (nurse case-management, joint crisis plan, meetings with relatives/network and follow-up calls) and (ii) their recovery were explored. The material was analysed by means of thematic analysis with a deductive-inductive approach. Results Participants valued the human and professional qualities of the nurse case-manager, and appreciated follow-up calls and meetings. However, their views diverged regarding for instance frequency of phone calls, or disclosing information or lack thereof. Interpersonal relationship, suicide attempters’ own resources and life changes emerged as core recovery factors. Discussion The study highlights the figure of an engaged clinician, with both professional and human commitment, aware that some suicide attempters put more emphasis on their own resources than on delivered health care. Conclusions Interventions should consider the clinician as the cornerstone of the tailored care valued by suicide attempters."
https://openalex.org/W3130022397,"Background This study investigated the outcomes of kidney transplantation (KT) over a 16-year period in Korea and identified risk factors for graft failure using a nationwide population-based cohort. Methods We investigated the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Health Information Database. Health insurance claims for patients who underwent KT between 2002 and 2017 were analyzed. Results The data from 18,331 patients who underwent their first KT were reviewed. The percentage of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) induction continuously increased from 2.0% in 2002 to 23.5% in 2017. Rituximab began to be used in 2008 and had increased to 141 patients (9.6%) in 2013. Acute rejection occurred in 17.3% of all patients in 2002 but decreased to 6.3% in 2017. The rejection-free survival rates were 78.8% at 6 months after KT, 76.1% after 1 year, 67.5% after 5 years, 61.7% after 10 years, and 56.7% after 15 years. The graft survival rates remained over 80% until 12 years after KT, and then rapidly decreased to 50.5% at 16 years after KT. In Cox’s multivariate analysis, risk factors for graft failure included being male, more recent KT, KT from deceased donor, use of ATG, basiliximab, or rituximab, tacrolimus use as an initial calcineurin inhibitor, acute rejection history, and cytomegalovirus infection. Conclusions ATG and rituximab use has gradually increased in Korea and more recent KT is associated with an increased risk of graft failure. Therefore, meticulous preoperative evaluation and postoperative management are necessary in the case of recent KT with high risk of graft failure."
https://openalex.org/W3133306480,"Objective Autonomic imbalance plays a crucial role in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) associated atrial fibrillation (AF). Here, we investigated the potential neural mechanism of AF induced by OSA. Methods Ten dogs were divided into control group (n = 5) and OSA group (n = 5). The chronic OSA model was established by repeat apnea-ventilation cycles for 4 hours a day for 12 weeks. During the process of model establishment, arterial blood gases, atrial effective refractory period (AERP), AF inducibility, normalized low-frequency power (LFnu), normalized high-frequency power (HFnu), and LFnu/ HFnu were evaluated at baseline, 4 th week, 8 th week, and 12 th week. Nerve activities of left stellate ganglion (LSG) and left vagal nerve(LVN) were recorded. Tyrosine hydroxylase(TH), choline acetyltransferase(CHAT), PGP9.5, nerve growth factor(NGF), and c-Fos were detected in the left atrium, LSG, and LVN by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Moreover, high-frequency stimulations of LSG and LVN were conducted to observe the AF inducibility. Results Compared with the control group, the OSA group showed significantly enhanced neural activity of the LSG, increased AF inducibility, and shortened AERP. LFnu and LFnu/HFnu were markedly increased in the OSA group, while no significant difference in HFnu was observed. TH-positive and PGP9.5-positive nerve densities were significantly increased in the LSG and left atrium. Additionally, the protein levels of NGF, c-Fos, and PGP9.5 were upregulated both in the LSG and left atrium. AF inducibility was markedly increased under LSG stimulation without a stimulus threshold change in the OSA group. Conclusions OSA significantly enhanced LSG and left atrial neural remodeling, and hyperactivity of LSG may accelerate left atrial neural remodeling to increase AF inducibility."
https://openalex.org/W3129861863,"Occupationally-induced back pain is a leading cause of reduced productivity in industry. Detecting when a worker is lifting incorrectly and at increased risk of back injury presents significant possible benefits. These include increased quality of life for the worker due to lower rates of back injury and fewer workers' compensation claims and missed time for the employer. However, recognizing lifting risk provides a challenge due to typically small datasets and subtle underlying features in accelerometer and gyroscope data. A novel method to classify a lifting dataset using a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) and no manual feature extraction is proposed in this paper; the dataset consisted of 10 subjects lifting at various relative distances from the body with 720 total trials. The proposed deep CNN displayed greater accuracy (90.6%) compared to an alternative CNN and multilayer perceptron (MLP). A deep CNN could be adapted to classify many other activities that traditionally pose greater challenges in industrial environments due to their size and complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3130752143,"Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world. The mechanisms underlying CRC development, progression, and resistance to treatment are complex and not fully understood. The immune response in the tumor microenvironment has been shown to play a significant role in many cancers, including colorectal cancer. Colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) has been associated with changes to the immune environment in colorectal cancer animal models. We hypothesized that CSF3 signaling would correlate with pro-tumor tumor microenvironment changes associated with immune infiltrate and response. We utilized publicly available datasets to guide future mechanistic studies of the role CSF3 and its receptor (CSF3R) play in colorectal cancer development and progression. Here, we use bioinformatics data and mRNA from patients with colon (n = 242) or rectal (n = 92) cancers, obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas Firehose Legacy dataset. We examined correlations of CSF3 and CSF3R expression with patient demographics, tumor stage and consensus molecular subtype classification. Gene expression correlations, cell type enrichment, Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data scores and Gene Ontology were used to analyze expression of receptor and ligand, tumor microenvironment infiltration of immune cells, and alterations in biological pathways. We found that CSF3 and CSF3R expression is highest in consensus molecular subtype 1 and consensus molecular subtype 4. Ligand and receptor expression are also correlated with changes in T cell and macrophage signatures. CSF3R significantly correlates with a large number of genes that are associated with poor colorectal cancer prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3132271733,"Speech is perceived with both the ears and the eyes. Adding congruent visual speech improves the perception of a faint auditory speech stimulus, whereas adding incongruent visual speech can alter the perception of the utterance. The latter phenomenon is the case of the McGurk illusion, where an auditory stimulus such as e.g. “ba” dubbed onto a visual stimulus such as “ga” produces the illusion of hearing “da”. Bayesian models of multisensory perception suggest that both the enhancement and the illusion case can be described as a two-step process of binding (informed by prior knowledge) and fusion (informed by the information reliability of each sensory cue). However, there is to date no study which has accounted for how they each contribute to audiovisual speech perception. In this study, we expose subjects to both congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech, manipulating the binding and the fusion stages simultaneously. This is done by varying both temporal offset (binding) and auditory and visual signal-to-noise ratio (fusion). We fit two Bayesian models to the behavioural data and show that they can both account for the enhancement effect in congruent audiovisual speech, as well as the McGurk illusion. This modelling approach allows us to disentangle the effects of binding and fusion on behavioural responses. Moreover, we find that these models have greater predictive power than a forced fusion model. This study provides a systematic and quantitative approach to measuring audiovisual integration in the perception of the McGurk illusion as well as congruent audiovisual speech, which we hope will inform future work on audiovisual speech perception."
https://openalex.org/W3132325755,"Coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is a disease that can result in substantial illness and death. It is most common in the southwestern United States and areas of Latin America with arid climates, though reports increasingly suggest its range is wider than previously recognized. The natural habitat of the causative organisms, Coccidioides spp., have been associated with certain soil properties and climatic conditions. Current understanding of its geographic range is primarily defined by skin test studies and outbreak locations. We developed a fuzzy system model to predict suitable soil habitats for Coccidioides across the western United States based on parameters (electrical conductivity, organic matter content, pH, water holding capacity, temperature, and precipitation) from sites where soil sampling has confirmed the presence of Coccidioides . The model identified high coccidioidomycosis incidence areas as having high suitability and identified pockets of elevated suitability corresponding with outbreak locations outside the traditional range. By providing high-resolution estimates of Coccidioides suitability, including areas without public health surveillance for coccidioidomycosis, this model may be able to aid public health and clinical provider decision making. Awareness of possible Coccidioides soil habitats could help mitigate risk during soil-disturbing activities and help providers improve coccidioidomycosis diagnosis and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3132753029,"Background Exceptional agers (85+ years) are characterized by preserved cognition presumably due to high cognitive reserve. In the current study, we examined whether personality, risk and protective factors for dementia as well as quality of life are associated with core features of Alzheimer’s disease (amyloid-deposition and hippocampal volume) as well as cognition in exceptional aging. Methods We studied 49 exceptional agers (average 87.8 years, range 84–94 years), with preserved activities of daily living and absence of dementia. All participants received a detailed clinical and neuropsychological examination. We used established questionnaires to measure lifetime experience, personality, recent physical and cognitive activity as well as quality of life. Cerebral amyloid-deposition was estimated by 18-[F]-Flutemetamol-PET and manual hippocampal volumetry was performed on 3D T1 MRI images. Results In this sample of exceptional agers with preserved activities of daily living, we found intact cognitive performance in the subjects with the highest amyloid-load in the brain, but a lower quality of life with respect to autonomy as well as higher neuroticism. Higher self-reported physical activity in the last twelve months went with a lower amyloid load. Higher self-reported leisure-time/ not work-related activity went with better executive functioning at older age. Conclusion Even in exceptional aging, high amyloid load may subtly influence personality and quality of life. Our findings support a close relationship between high physical activity and low amyloid-deposition and underscore the importance of extracurricular activities for executive functions. As executive functions are known to be a central resource for everyday functioning in fostering extracurricular activities may be effective in delaying the onset of dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3133130617,"Background Viruses are the most frequent cause of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in children. It is currently unknown whether presence of a virus, the number of viruses, or type of virus, are associated with clinical outcomes of pediatric SARI in developing countries. Methods Between 2012 and 2014 nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic and clinical variables were prospectively collected for surveillance of viral causes of SARI in Surinamese children within 48 hours after hospitalization. These swabs were tested for 18 respiratory viruses using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel to identify the specific viral causes of SARI, unknown to the treating physicians. In post hoc analyses we evaluated if the PCR results, and demographic and clinical characteristics, were associated with course of disease, duration of respiratory support, and length of stay (LOS). Results Of a total of 316 analyzed children, 290 (92%) had one or more viruses. Rhinovirus/enterovirus (43%) and respiratory syncytial virus (34%) were most prevalent. Course of disease was mild in 234 (74%), moderate in 68 (22%), and severe in 14 (4%) children. Neither presence of a single virus, multiple viruses, or the type of virus, were different between groups. Prematurity and lower weight-for-age-z-score were independent predictors of a severe course of disease, longer duration of respiratory support, and longer LOS. Conclusions Viruses are common causes of pediatric SARI in Suriname, yet not necessarily associated with clinical outcomes. In developing countries, demographic and clinical variables can help to identify children at-risk for worse outcome, while PCR testing may be reserved to identify specific viruses, such as influenza, in specific patient groups or during outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3129257537,"Purpose The ocular surface microbiome has been described as paucibacterial. Until now, studies investigating the bacterial community associated with the ocular surface through high-throughput sequencing have focused on the conjunctiva. Conjunctival samples are thought to reflect and be representative of the microbiome residing on the ocular surface, including the cornea. Here, we hypothesized that the bacterial community associated with the corneal surface was different from those of the inferonasal and superotemporal conjunctival fornices, and from the tear film. Methods Both eyes from 15 healthy piglets were sampled using swabs (inferonasal fornix, superotemporal fornix, and corneal surface, n = 30 each) and Schirmer tear test strips (STT, n = 30). Negative sampling controls (swabs and STT, n = 2 each) and extraction controls ( n = 4) were included. Total DNA was extracted and high-throughput sequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene was performed. Bioinformatic analyses included multiple contamination-controlling steps. Results Corneal surface samples had a significantly lower number of taxa detected ( P &lt;0.01) and were compositionally different from all other sample types (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, P &lt;0.04). It also harbored higher levels of Proteobacteria ( P &lt;0.05), specifically Brevundimonas spp. (4.1-fold) and Paracoccus spp. (3.4-fold) than other sample types. Negative control STT strip samples yielded the highest amount of 16S rRNA gene copies across all sample types ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusions Our data suggests that the corneal surface provides a distinct environmental niche within the ocular surface, leading to a bacterial community compositionally different from all other sample types."
https://openalex.org/W3130087088,"Background Acute febrile illness (AFI) is an important cause for seeking health care among children. Knowledge of the most common etiologic agents of AFI and its seasonality is limited in most tropical regions. Methodology/Principal findings To describe the viral etiology of AFI in pediatric patients (≤18 years) recruited through a sentinel enhanced dengue surveillance system (SEDSS) in Southern Puerto Rico, we analyzed data for patients enrolled from 2012 to May 2018. To identify seasonal patterns, we applied time-series analyses to monthly arboviral and respiratory infection case data. We calculated coherence and phase differences for paired time-series to quantify the association between each time series. A viral pathogen was found in 47% of the 14,738 patients. Influenza A virus was the most common pathogen detected (26%). The incidence of Zika and dengue virus etiologies increased with age. Arboviral infections peaked between June and September throughout the times-series. Respiratory infections have seasonal peaks occurring in the fall and winter months of each year, though patterns vary by individual respiratory pathogen. Conclusions/Significance Distinct seasonal patterns and differences in relative frequency by age groups seen in this study can guide clinical and laboratory assessment in pediatric patients with AFI in Puerto Rico."
https://openalex.org/W3129395470,"Berberine is a promising botanical pesticide against fungal plant pathogens. However, whether berberine inhibits the invasion of fungal pathogen across plant surface remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that the enzyme activities of purified cutinase from fungal pathogen Colletotrichum capsici were partially inhibited in presence of berberine toward different substrates. Molecular dynamics simulation results suggested the rigidity of cutinase was decreased with berberine added into the system. Interestingly, aggregations of berberine to the catalytic center of cutinase were observed, and stronger hydrophobic interactions were detected between key residue His 208 and berberine with concentrations of berberine increased. More importantly, this hydrophobic interaction conferred conformational change of the imidazole ring of His 208, which swung out of the catalytic center to an inactive mode. In summary, we provided the molecular mechanism of the effect of berberine on cutinase from C . capsici ."
https://openalex.org/W3131049204,"Background Targeted testing and treatment of TB infection to prevent disease is a pillar of TB elimination. Despite recent global commitments to greatly expand access to preventive treatment for TB infection, there remains a lack of research on how best to expand preventive treatment programs in settings with high TB burdens. Methods We conducted implementation research in Lima, Peru, around a multifaceted intervention to deliver TB preventive treatment to close contacts of all ages, health care workers, and people in congregate settings. Key interventions included use of the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), specialist support for generalist physicians at primary-level health facilities, and treatment support by community health workers. We applied a convergent mixed methods approach to evaluate feasibility and acceptability based on a care cascade framework. Findings During April 2019-January 2020, we enrolled 1,002 household contacts, 148 non-household contacts, 107 residents and staff of congregate settings, and 357 health care workers. Cumulative completion of the TB preventive care cascade was 34% for contacts &lt;5 years old, 28% for contacts 5–19 years old, 18% for contacts ≥20 years old, 0% for people in congregate settings, and 4% of health care workers. IGRA testing was acceptable to adults exposed to TB. Preventive treatment was acceptable to contacts, but less acceptable to physicians, who frequently had doubts about prescribing preventive treatment for adults. Community-based treatment support was both acceptable and feasible, and periodic home-visits or calls were identified as facilitators of adherence. Conclusions We attempted to close the gap in TB preventive treatment in Peru by expanding preventive services to adult contacts and other risk groups. While suboptimal, care cascade completion for adult contacts was consistent with what has been observed in high-income settings. The major losses in the care cascade occurred in completing evaluations and having doctors prescribe preventive treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3131415371,"Childbirth outside marriage has several negative implications for the well-being of children, women, and families globally. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, the phenomenon appears to be under-studied. In this study, we examine the levels and socioeconomic correlates of nonmarital fertility in Ghana. Using pooled data from the 2003, 2008, and the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys, logistic regression models were used in determining significantly predictive factors of nonmarital fertility. The results show that nonmarital fertility levels have been on the rise over time without any sign of reduction (24.0%, 33.0%, and 40.0% for 2003, 2008, and 2014, respectively). Some socioeconomic characteristics are linked to nonmarital fertility levels with women without formal education, women from poor households, and self-employed women having significantly higher nonmarital fertility risks. Also, older unmarried women, women who have an early sexual debut, cohabiters, women with unmet need for family planning are all associated with considerably higher risks of nonmarital childbearing. A few significant regional disparities also exist, with the Central Region having higher whereas the Upper West Region has lower risks of nonmarital fertility compared to the Greater Accra Region. Childbirth outside marriage is a social concern among women in Ghana. The findings have possible implications for bridging socioeconomic disparities among unmarried women."
https://openalex.org/W3129245565,"The serotonin transporter (5-HTT) is a key molecule of serotoninergic neurotransmission and target of many anxiolytics and antidepressants. In humans, 5-HTT gene variants resulting in lower expression levels are associated with behavioral traits of anxiety. Furthermore, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reported increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) during resting state (RS) and amygdala hyperreactivity. 5-HTT deficient mice as an established animal model for anxiety disorders seem to be well suited for investigating amygdala (re-)activity in an fMRI study. We investigated wildtype (5-HTT+/+), heterozygous (5-HTT+/-), and homozygous 5-HTT-knockout mice (5-HTT-/-) of both sexes in an ultra-high-field 17.6 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. CBF was measured with continuous arterial spin labeling during RS, stimulation state (SS; with odor of rats as aversive stimulus), and post-stimulation state (PS). Subsequently, post mortem c-Fos immunohistochemistry elucidated neural activation on cellular level. The results showed that in reaction to the aversive odor CBF in total brain and amygdala of all mice significantly increased. In male 5-HTT+/+ mice amygdala RS CBF levels were found to be significantly lower than in 5-HTT+/- mice. From RS to SS 5-HTT+/+ amygdala perfusion significantly increased compared to both 5-HTT+/- and 5-HTT-/- mice. Perfusion level changes of male mice correlated with the density of c-Fos-immunoreactive cells in the amygdaloid nuclei. In female mice the perfusion was not modulated by the 5-Htt -genotype, but by estrous cycle stages. We conclude that amygdala reactivity is modulated by the 5-Htt genotype in males. In females, gonadal hormones have an impact which might have obscured genotype effects. Furthermore, our results demonstrate experimental support for the tonic model of 5-HTT LPR function."
https://openalex.org/W3130848272,"There is an urgent need for childhood surveillance systems to design, implement, and evaluate interventions at the local level. We estimated obesity prevalence for individuals aged 5–17 years using a southcentral Wisconsin EHR data repository, Public Health Information Exchange (PHINEX, 2007–2012). The prevalence estimates were calculated by aggregating the estimated probability of each individual being obese, which was obtained via a generalized linear mixed model. We incorporated the random effects at the area level into our model. A weighted procedure was employed to account for missingness in EHR data. A non-parametric kernel smoothing method was used to obtain the prevalence estimates for locations with no or little data (&lt;20 individuals) from the EHR. These estimates were compared to results from newly available obesity atlas (2015–2016) developed from various EHRs with greater statewide representation. The mean of the zip code level obesity prevalence estimates for males and females aged 5–17 years is 16.2% (SD 2.72%); 17.9% (SD 2.14%) for males and 14.4% (SD 2.00%) for females. The results were comparable to the Wisconsin Health Atlas (WHA) estimates, a much larger dataset of local community EHRs in Wisconsin. On average, prevalence estimates were 2.12% lower in this process than the WHA estimates, with lower estimation occurring more frequently for zip codes without data in PHINEX. Using this approach, we can obtain estimates for local areas that lack EHRs data. Generally, lower prevalence estimates were produced for those locations not represented in the PHINEX database when compared to WHA estimates. This underscores the need to ensure that the reference EHRs database can be made sufficiently similar to the geographic areas where synthetic estimates are being created."
https://openalex.org/W3131294920,"Predation mortality can influence the distribution and abundance of fish populations. While predation is often assessed using direct observations of prey consumption, potential predation can be predicted from co-occurring predator and prey densities under varying environmental conditions. Juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. (i.e., smolts) from the Columbia River Basin experience elevated mortality during the transition from estuarine to ocean habitat, but a thorough understanding of the role of predation remains incomplete. We used a Holling type II functional response to estimate smolt predation risk based on observations of piscivorous seabirds (sooty shearwater [ Ardenna griseus ] and common murre [ Uria aalge ]) and local densities of alternative prey fish including northern anchovy ( Engraulis mordax ) in Oregon and Washington coastal waters during May and June 2010–2012. We evaluated predation risk relative to the availability of alternative prey and physical factors including turbidity and Columbia River plume area, and compared risk to returns of adult salmon. Seabirds and smolts consistently co-occurred at sampling stations throughout most of the study area (mean = 0.79 ± 0.41, SD), indicating that juvenile salmon are regularly exposed to avian predators during early marine residence. Predation risk for juvenile coho ( Oncorhynchus kisutch ), yearling Chinook salmon ( O . tshawytscha ), and subyearling Chinook salmon was on average 70% lower when alternative prey were present. Predation risk was greater in turbid waters, and decreased as water clarity increased. Juvenile coho and yearling Chinook salmon predation risk was lower when river plume surface areas were greater than 15,000 km 2 , while the opposite was estimated for subyearling Chinook salmon. These results suggest that plume area, turbidity, and forage fish abundance near the mouth of the Columbia River, all of which are influenced by river discharge, are useful indicators of potential juvenile salmon mortality that could inform salmonid management."
https://openalex.org/W3131672144,"This paper suggests and tests a psychological model of environmental art perception and subsequent support for climate change policies. The model is based on findings from art perception and environmental psychology, which indicate that the response of the viewer to the artwork is (1) first an emotional reaction, which can be positive and/or negative. The emotional activation leads to (2) evaluation of the perceived quality of the artwork. This forms the first impression of the artwork the viewer gets, which then triggers (3) reflections on the artwork that are finally related to support for climate policies. The model test uses data collected at the ArtCOP21 that accompanied the 21 st UN climate summit in Paris. At 37 connected events, the research team collected 883 audience responses with a brief quantitative paper-pencil questionnaire. The data were analyzed using a multilevel-structural equation modeling approach. Results support the suggested theoretical model. Moreover, the effect of reflections on the artwork on support for climate policies is moderated by environmental attitudes, meaning the lower the environmental attitudes, the higher the effect of reflections on policy support. Finally, artwork features like color, size, displaying something personal, etc., could be identified that had a significant relation to differences on the artwork level regarding the first impression of the artwork and the reflections elicited. The study shows that being confronted with climate change-related artwork relates at least in the short run to increased climate policy support, which is mostly channeled through an emotional activation with following cognitive processing. Features of the artwork relate to how strongly and which emotions are activated."
https://openalex.org/W3132074470,"The human enteric bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica causes approximately 1.35 million cases of food borne illnesses annually in the United States. Of these salmonellosis cases, almost half are derived from the consumption of fresh, raw produce. Although epiphytic S . enterica populations naturally decline in the phyllosphere, a subset of phytophagous insects have recently been identified as biological multipliers, consequently facilitating the growth of bacterial populations. We investigated whether tomato leaves with macroscopic feeding damage, caused by infestation of adult Western flower thrips ( Frankliniella occidentalis ), support higher S . enterica populations. To explore this hypothesis, we assessed S . enterica populations in response to thrips feeding by varying insect density, plant age, and the gender of the insect. As a reference control, direct leaf damage analogous to thrips feeding was also evaluated using directed, hydraulic pressure. In a supplementary set series of experiments, groups of F . occidentalis infested tomato plants were later inoculated with S . enterica to determine how prior insect infestation might influence bacterial survival and persistence. Following an infestation period, leaves visibly damaged by adult F . occidentalis supported significantly higher S . enterica populations and resulted in greater amounts of electrolyte leakage (measured as electrical conductivity) than leaves lacking visible feeding damage. Plant age did not significantly influence S . enterica populations or estimates of electrolyte leakage, independent of initial infestation. Additionally, the gender of the insect did not uniquely influence S . enterica population dynamics. Finally, applications of aggressive water bombardment resulted in more electrolyte leakage than leaves damaged by F . occidentalis , yet supported comparable S . enterica populations. Together, this study indicates that F . occidentalis feeding is one of the many potential biological mechanisms creating a more habitable environment for S . enterica ."
https://openalex.org/W3133460652,"Osteoporosis is a progressive systemic skeletal disease associated with decreased bone mineral density and deterioration of bone quality, and it affects millions of people worldwide. Currently, it is treated mainly using antiresorptive and osteoanabolic agents. However, these drugs have severe adverse effects. Cell replacement therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could serve as a treatment strategy for osteoporosis in the future. LIGHT (HVEM-L, TNFSF14, or CD258) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. However, the effect of recombinant LIGHT (rhLIGHT) on osteogenesis in human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBM-MSCs) is unknown. Therefore, we monitored the effects of LIGHT on osteogenesis of hBM-MSCs. Lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR), which is a LIGHT receptor, was constitutively expressed on the surface of hBM-MSCs. After rhLIGHT treatment, calcium and phosphate deposition in hBM-MSCs, stained by Alizarin red and von Kossa, respectively, significantly increased. We performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine the expressions of osteoprogenitor markers (RUNX2/CBFA1 and collagen I alpha 1) and osteoblast markers (alkaline phosphatase, osterix/Sp7, and osteocalcin) and immunoblotting to assess the underlying biological mechanisms following rhLIGHT treatment. We found that rhLIGHT treatment enhanced von Kossa- and Alizarin red-positive hBM-MSCs and induced the expression of diverse differentiation markers of osteogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. WNT/β-catenin pathway activation strongly mediated rhLIGHT-induced osteogenesis of hBM-MSCs, accelerating the differentiation of hBM-MSCs into osteocytes. In conclusion, the interaction between LIGHT and LTβR enhances osteogenesis of hBM-MSCs. Therefore, LIGHT might play an important role in stem cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3129515555,"A protocol for high-frequency direct organogenesis from root explants of Kachai lemon ( Citrus jambhiri Lush.) was developed. Full-length roots (~3 cm) were isolated from the in vitro grown seedlings and cultured on Murashige and Skoog basal medium supplemented with Nitsch vitamin (MSN) with different concentrations of cytokinin [6-benzylaminopurine, (BAP)] and gibberellic acid (GA 3 ). The frequency of multiple shoot proliferation was very high, with an average of 34.3 shoots per root explant when inoculated on the MSN medium supplemented with BAP (1.0 mg L –1 ) and GA 3 (1.0 mg L –1 ). Optimal rooting was induced in the plantlets under half strength MSN medium supplemented with indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 0.5–1.0 mg L –1 ). IAA induced better root structure than 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), which was evident from the scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The expressions of growth regulating factor genes ( GRF1 and GRF5 ) and GA 3 signaling genes ( GA2OX1 and KO1 ) were elevated in the regenerants obtained from MSN+BAP (1.0 mg L -1 )+GA 3 (1.0 mg L -1 ). The expressions of auxin regulating genes were high in roots obtained in ½ MSN+IAA 1.0 mg L -1 . Furthermore, indexing of the regenerants confirmed that there was no amplicons detected for Huanglongbing bacterium and Citrus tristeza virus. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and inter simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers detected no polymorphic bands amongst the regenerated plants. This is the first report that describes direct organogenesis from the root explant of Citrus jambhiri Lush. The high-frequency direct regeneration protocol in the present study provides an enormous significance in Citrus organogenesis, its commercial cultivation and genetic conservation."
https://openalex.org/W3129901355,"Identifying individuals at risk for future hospitalization or death has been a major priority of population health management strategies. High-risk individuals are a heterogeneous group, and existing studies describing heterogeneity in high-risk individuals have been limited by data focused on clinical comorbidities and not socioeconomic or behavioral factors. We used machine learning clustering methods and linked comorbidity-based, sociodemographic, and psychobehavioral data to identify subgroups of high-risk Veterans and study long-term outcomes, hypothesizing that factors other than comorbidities would characterize several subgroups.In this cross-sectional study, we used data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, a national repository of VA administrative claims and electronic health data. To identify high-risk Veterans, we used the Care Assessment Needs (CAN) score, a routinely-used VA model that predicts a patient's percentile risk of hospitalization or death at one year. Our study population consisted of 110,000 Veterans who were randomly sampled from 1,920,436 Veterans with a CAN score≥75th percentile in 2014. We categorized patient-level data into 119 independent variables based on demographics, comorbidities, pharmacy, vital signs, laboratories, and prior utilization. We used a previously validated density-based clustering algorithm to identify 30 subgroups of high-risk Veterans ranging in size from 50 to 2,446 patients. Mean CAN score ranged from 72.4 to 90.3 among subgroups. Two-year mortality ranged from 0.9% to 45.6% and was highest in the home-based care and metastatic cancer subgroups. Mean inpatient days ranged from 1.4 to 30.5 and were highest in the post-surgery and blood loss anemia subgroups. Mean emergency room visits ranged from 1.0 to 4.3 and were highest in the chronic sedative use and polysubstance use with amphetamine predominance subgroups. Five subgroups were distinguished by psychobehavioral factors and four subgroups were distinguished by sociodemographic factors.High-risk Veterans are a heterogeneous population consisting of multiple distinct subgroups-many of which are not defined by clinical comorbidities-with distinct utilization and outcome patterns. To our knowledge, this represents the largest application of ML clustering methods to subgroup a high-risk population. Further study is needed to determine whether distinct subgroups may benefit from individualized interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3130795893,"The aim of this study was to examine the effect of long-term locking plate fixation on the cortical bone of the canine radius. Locking compression plates were fixed to the left and right radius in dogs (n = 3). The left radius was fixed with a locking head screw (Locking Plate group, LP). The locking compression plate was compressed periosteally in the right radius using a cortex screw (Compression Plate group, CP). Radial bones from dogs that were euthanized for other purposes were collected as an untreated control group (Control group). After euthanasia at 36 weeks following plate fixation, radial bones were evaluated for bone mineral density and underwent histological analysis. Bone metabolic markers were analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Statistical analyses were performed for comparisons between groups. The LP group showed no significant difference in bone mineral density after plate fixation, whereas the CP group showed significantly lower bone mineral density. Histological analysis indicated that the number of osteoclasts and rate of empty lacunae increased significantly in the CP group relative to the Control and LP groups. qPCR analysis indicated increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-6 , and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 in the CP group, whereas Runt-related transcription factor 2 , an osteoblast marker, was similar in all groups. The expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α in the CP group was also increased relative to that in the Control and LP groups. Thus, locking plate fixation is a biologically superior fixation method that does not cause implant-induced osteoporosis in the bone in the long term."
https://openalex.org/W3130411956,"Discriminatory behaviors among inter-ethnic relations in schools have long been noted and studied, but there are several correlations between discriminatory behaviors and other constructs that need further investigation. As an example, the relation between perceived discrimination and contextual problems—which include family, school and peer problems—among children and adolescents in Latin America has received little attention from previous studies. Further, the mediating role of ethnic identification and collective self-esteem in this relation also needs to be considered as they could be proven as protective factors for discriminatory behavior and its outcomes. Therefore, this study aimed to, first, establish the relationship between perceived discrimination and contextual problems in inter-ethnic students aged 8–19 years living in Arica, Chile; and second, to identify the role that ethnic identification and collective self-esteem play within this relation. In order to investigate this matter, a cross-sectional study was carried out with 3700 students in 29 schools between the fourth year of primary education and the last year of secondary education, aged between 9–18 years, with 48.4% men and 51.6% women. The sample was divided into primary and secondary school groups. The scales utilized were the Everyday Discrimination Scale, Multi-Group Ethnic Identity Measure-Revised Scale, Collective Self-Esteem Scale and the dimensions of contextual family, school and peer problems, as well as the general index of contextual problems of the Child and Adolescent Assessment System. For data analysis, we tested a path analytic model at both the within and between levels to account for the relations between variables. In each group the models obtained an optimal fit. We found that perceived discrimination and ethnic identification were directly related to contextual problems (.23-.39), and collective self-esteem had only a mediating role. This study showed that strategized interventions focusing on ethnic identification and perceived discrimination should be utilized by schools to create a better developing environment."
https://openalex.org/W3130895920,"Inherent uncertainties in demand and supply make it problematic for supply chains to accomplish optimum inventory replenishment, resulting in loss of sales or keeping excessive inventories. To cope with erratic demands, organizations have to maintain excessive inventory levels, sometimes taking up to one-third of an organization’s annual budget. The two most pressing concerns to handle in inventory management are: how much to order and when to order. Therefore, an organization ought to make the correct and timely decisions based on precise demand information to avoid excessive inventory accumulation resulting in enhanced competitive advantage. Owing to the significance of inventory control and analysis, this paper reports on developing and successfully implementing a hybrid framework for optimum level inventory forecasting in Technical Services Organizations. The proposed framework is based on a case study of one of Pakistan’s leading Technical Services Organization. The paper presents a statistical analysis of historical data and a comprehensive fault trend analysis. Both these analyses set a solid foundation for the formulation of a comparative analysis matrix based upon price and quantity based analysis of inventory. Finally, a decision criterion (Forecasting Model) is proposed using three primary forecasting techniques with minimum error calculations. The study’s finding shows a forecast error of 142.5 million rupees in the last five years, resulting in the accumulation of more than 25 thousand excessive inventory stock. Application of price and quantity based analysis identifies that 65% of the annual budget is significantly dependent upon only 9% (in terms of quantity) of ""High Price and Small Quantity"" Items (HS). These HS items are forecasted through three different forecasting methods, i.e., Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Trend Projection, with Minimum Absolute Deviation to significantly reduce the forecasting error while predicting the future required quantity. The research work aims to contribute to the inventory management literature in three ways. First, a new comparative analysis matrix concept for identifying the most critical items is introduced. Second, a Multi-Criteria Forecasting Model is developed to capture a wide range of operations. Third, the paper suggests how these forecasting criteria can be integrated into a single interactive DSS to maintain optimum inventory level stock. Even though the DSS framework is based on data from a single organization, the application is expected to manage inventory stock in a wide range of manufacturing and services industries. This study’s proposed hybrid framework is the first of its kind that encapsulates all four dimensions of inventory classification criteria, forming a multi-criteria hybrid model within a DSS framework."

The most common methods of measuring adherence are post-treatment measures; that is, adherence is usually measured after the treatment has begun. What the authors are proposing in this multidisciplinary study is a new technique for predicting the factors that are likely to cause non-adherence before or during medication treatment, illustrated in the context of potential non-adherence to COVID-19 antiviral medication. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), allows system analysts to determine how combinations of simple faults of a system can propagate to cause a total system failure. Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical algorithm that depends heavily on repeated random sampling to predict the behaviour of a system. In this study, the authors propose a new technique called Non-Adherence Tree Analysis (NATA), based on the FTA and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, to improve adherence. Firstly, the non-adherence factors of a medication treatment lifecycle are translated into what is referred to as a Non-Adherence Tree (NAT). Secondly, the NAT is coded into a format that is translated into the GoldSim software for performing dynamic system modelling and analysis using Monte Carlo. Finally, the GoldSim model is simulated and analysed to predict the behaviour of the NAT. NATA is dynamic and able to learn from emerging datasets to improve the accuracy of future predictions. It produces a framework for improving adherence by analysing social and non-social adherence barriers. Novel terminologies and mathematical expressions have been developed and applied to real-world scenarios. The results of the application of NATA using data from six previous studies in relation to antiviral medication demonstrate a predictive model which suggests that the biggest factor that could contribute to non-adherence to a COVID-19 antiviral treatment is a therapy-related factor (the side effects of the medication). This is closely followed by a condition-related factor (asymptomatic nature of the disease) then patient-related factors (forgetfulness and other causes). From the results, it appears that side effects, asymptomatic factors and forgetfulness contribute 32.44%, 22.67% and 18.22% respectively to discontinuation of medication treatment of COVID-19 antiviral medication treatment. With this information, clinicians can implement relevant interventions and measures and allocate resources appropriately to minimise non-adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3129396541,"Purpose To investigate the stress-strain behaviour of 9 soft contact lens materials, that are commonly used in the market, under uniaxial compression loading. Methods Seven types of hydrogel and two types of silicone-hydrogel soft contact lens materials were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution then subjected to uniaxial compression loads. The load rate was set to 16.0 N/min starting with two consecutive initial 5.0 N loading cycles followed by three relaxation periods of 4.0 min within which there were two more 5.0 N loading cycles and eventually, a full loading cycle that stopped at a load of 49.0 N. The load and contraction data obtained experimentally were analysed to derive the stress-strain behaviour. Finite Element (FE) analysis was then utilised to evaluate the performance of soft contact lenses on the human eye and handling lenses off the eye. Results Unlike tensile tests, all tested materials showed nonlinear behaviour when tested under compression. When fitted to first-order Ogden hyperelastic model, parameter μ was found to be varying in the range 0.12 to 0.74 MPa and material parameter α was found to be varying in the range 8.2 to 20.326 among the nine tested materials. Compression modulus of elasticity was 2.2 times higher than the tensile modulus of elasticity on average. FE simulation with nonlinear Ogden constitutive model showed a limited change (8%~12%) in the optical performance when compared to other material models, however, it predicted higher stress when the lens was simulated under bending during off-eye handling. Conclusions Compression tests revealed slightly nonlinear behaviour when materials were strained under compression stress down to 15% ~ 30% of their nominal heights. Considering the physiological compression loading range of 8 mmHg, secant moduli of elasticity were 1.5% to 6.9% higher than the tension moduli of elasticity depending on the material. Tensile-based moduli of elasticity could be used in FE analysis as a step towards simulating the optical performance of soft contact lenses on-eye. However, nonlinear compression-based material models are recommended for FE analysis of soft contact lenses when lens-handling is investigated off-eye."
https://openalex.org/W3130774566,"Dogs play an important role in our society as companions and work partners, and proper training of these dogs is pivotal. For companion dogs, training helps preventing or managing dog behavioral problems—the most frequently cited reason for relinquishing and euthanasia, and it promotes successful dog-human relationships and thus maximizes benefits humans derive from bonding with dogs. For working dogs, training is crucial for them to successfully accomplish their jobs. Dog training methods range widely from those using predominantly aversive stimuli (aversive methods), to those combining aversive and rewarding stimuli (mixed methods) and those focusing on the use of rewards (reward methods). The use of aversive stimuli in training is highly controversial and several veterinary and animal protection organizations have recommended a ban on pinch collars, e-collars and other techniques that induce fear or pain in dogs, on the grounds that such methods compromise dog welfare. At the same time, training methods based on the use of rewards are claimed to be more humane and equally or more effective than aversive or mixed methods. This important discussion, however, has not always been based in solid scientific evidence. Although there is growing scientific evidence that training with aversive stimuli has a negative impact on dog welfare, the scientific literature on the efficacy and efficiency of the different methodologies is scarce and inconsistent. Hence, the goal of the current study is to investigate the efficacy and efficiency of different dog training methods. To that end, we will apply different dog training methods in a population of working dogs and evaluate the outcome after a period of training. The use of working dogs will allow for a rigorous experimental design and control, with randomization of treatments. Military (n = 10) and police (n = 20) dogs will be pseudo-randomly allocated to two groups. One group will be trained to perform a set of tasks (food refusal, interrupted recall, dumbbell retrieval and placing items in a basket) using reward methods and the other group will be trained for the same tasks using mixed methods. Later, the dogs will perform a standardized test where they will be required to perform the trained behaviors. The reliability of the behaviors and the time taken to learn them will be assessed in order to evaluate the efficacy and efficiency, respectively, of the different training methods. This study will be performed in collaboration with the Portuguese Army and with the Portuguese Public Security Police (PSP) and integrated with their dog training programs."
https://openalex.org/W3131592398,"In social animals, recognizing conspecifics and distinguishing them from other animal species is certainly important. We hypothesize, as demonstrated in other species of ungulates, that horses are able to discriminate between the faces of conspecifics and the faces of other domestic species (cattle, sheep, donkeys and pigs). Our hypothesis was tested by studying inter-and intra-specific visual discrimination abilities in horses through a two-way instrumental conditioning task (discrimination and reversal learning), using two-dimensional images of faces as discriminative stimuli and food as a positive reward. Our results indicate that 8 out of 10 horses were able to distinguish between two-dimensional images of the faces of horses and images showing the faces of other species. A similar performance was obtained in the reversal task. The horses’ ability to learn by discrimination is therefore comparable to other ungulates. Horses also showed the ability to learn a reversal task. However, these results were obtained regardless of the images the tested horses were exposed to. We therefore conclude that horses can discriminate between two dimensional images of conspecifics and two dimensional images of different species, however in our study, they were not able to make further subcategories within each of the two categories. Despite the fact that two dimensional images of animals could be treated differently from two dimensional images of non-social stimuli, our results beg the question as to whether a two-dimensional image can replace the real animal in cognitive tests."
https://openalex.org/W3131861809,"The study of musical expertise illustrates how intense training in a specialized domain may instigate development of implicit skills. While absolute pitch, or the ability to identify musical pitches without external reference, is rare even in professional musicians and is understood to have a genetic component, anecdotal evidence and pilot data suggest that some musicians without traditional absolute pitch are nonetheless better able to name notes played on their musical instrument of expertise than notes played on less familiar instruments. We have previously termed this particular gain in absolute pitch identification ability “instrument-specific absolute pitch” (ISAP) and have proposed that this skill is related to learned instrument type-specific timbral and intonational idiosyncrasies and articulatory motor planning activated by the timbre of the instrument. In this Registered Report Protocol, we describe two experiments designed to investigate ISAP in professional oboists. Experiment 1 tests for ISAP ability by comparing oboists’ pitch identification accuracies for notes played on the oboe and on the piano. A subset of the participants from Experiment 1 who demonstrate this ability will be recruited for Experiment 2; the purpose of Experiment 2 is to test hypotheses concerning a mechanistic explanation for ISAP. The outcome of these experiments may provide support for the theory that some individuals have ISAP and that the underlying mechanisms of this ability may rely on the perception of subtle timbral/intonational idiosyncrasies and on articulatory motor planning developed through intensive long-term training. In general, this work will contribute to the understanding of specialized expertise, specifically of implicit abilities and biases that are not addressed directly in training, but that may yet develop through practice of a related skill set."
https://openalex.org/W3132298716,"Aquatic organisms have been used to investigate the safety of chemicals worldwide. One such assessment is an algal growth inhibition test. Algal growth inhibition tests are commonly performed using a growth chamber with fluorescent lamps as the lighting source, as test guidelines require continuous uniform fluorescent illumination. However, fluorescent lamps contain mercury, which has been identified as hazardous to humans and other organisms. The Minamata Convention (adopted in 2013) requires reduction or prohibition of products containing mercury. On the other hand, light-emitting diodes do not contain mercury and provide a photosynthetically effective wavelength range of 400–700 nm which is an adequate light intensity for algal growth. Light-emitting diodes are thus preferable to fluorescent lamps as a potential light source in algal growth inhibition tests. In this study, we investigated if light-emitting diodes could be substituted for fluorescent lamps in growth inhibition studies with green alga ( Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata ), diatom ( Navicula pelliculosa ), and cyanobacteria ( Anabaena flos-aquae ). Algal growth inhibition tests were performed using five different chemicals known to have different modes of action and are assigned as reference substances in the test guidelines. The results of each algal test showed similar values between light-emitting diodes and fluorescent lamps in terms of conditions for the growth inhibition rate and percent inhibition in yield of each chemical. It was therefore concluded that using light-emitting diodes instead of fluorescent lamps as a lighting source had no effect on the algal growth inhibition test results."
https://openalex.org/W3133240078,"Objectives Although ethnic minority clients (EMs) from STI endemic countries have a higher risk for STI, little is known about their STI clinic consultation rate proportionality. The aim of this study was to assess consultation and chlamydia positivity rates among different EMs visiting STI clinics in the Netherlands. Methods We calculated consultation rates in EM groups by dividing the number of STI consultations by the total number of inhabitants in the region belonging to an EM, then compared the EM rates to native Dutch rates. Factors associated with chlamydia positivity were analysed using multivariate regression analysis. Results A total of 23,841 clients visiting an eastern Netherlands STI clinic between 2011 and 2013 were included in the analysis, of which 7% were EMs. The consultation rate of native Dutch clients was 22.5 per 1000, compared to 8.5 per 1000 among EMs. Consultation rates in all EMs were lower than in Dutch clients, except for Antillean or Aruban EMs and Latin American EMs. The chlamydia positivity rate among all clients was 15.5%, and Antillean or Aruban ethnicity (27.1%) EMs had the highest rates. Multivariate analysis identified the following factors associated with chlamydia positivity: Eastern or Northern European EM, African EM, Antillean or Aruban EM, STI related symptoms, heterosexual preference, partner in a risk group, receiving a partner notification, and having had three or more partners in the past six months. Conclusion On a population level, most EMs visit STI clinics less often than native Dutch clients, but they have a higher rate of positive chlamydia diagnoses. STI clinics should increase outreach activities for EM clients because they are insufficiently reached by current practices, but contribute substantially to chlamydia incidence rates."
https://openalex.org/W3132221703,"Objective Gremlin 1 (GREM1) is a secreted BMP2/4 inhibitor which regulates commitment and differentiation of human adipose precursor cells and prevents the browning effect of BMP4. GREM1 is an insulin antagonist and serum levels are high in type 2 diabetes (T2D). We here examined in vivo effects of AAV8 (Adeno-Associated Viral vectors of serotype eight) GREM 1 targeting the liver in mature mice to increase its systemic secretion and also, in a separate study, injected recombinant GREM 1 intraperitoneally. The objective was to characterize systemic effects of GREM 1 on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, body weight, adipose cell browning and other local tissue effects. Methods Adult mice were injected with AAV8 vectors expressing GREM1 in the liver or receiving regular intra-peritoneal injections of recombinant GREM1 protein. The mice were fed with a low fat or high fat diet (HFD) and followed over time. Results Liver-targeted AAV8-GREM1 did not alter body weight, whole-body glucose and insulin tolerance, or adipose tissue gene expression. Although GREM1 protein accumulated in liver cells, GREM1 serum levels were not increased suggesting that it may not have been normally processed for secretion. Hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis were also not changed. Repeated intraperitoneal rec-GREM1 injections for 5 weeks were also without effects on body weight and insulin sensitivity. UCP1 was slightly but significantly reduced in both white and brown adipose tissue but this was not of sufficient magnitude to alter body weight. We validated that recombinant GREM1 inhibited BMP4-induced pSMAD1/5/9 in murine cells in vitro, but saw no direct inhibitory effect on insulin signalling and pAkt (ser 473 and thr 308) activation. Conclusion GREM1 accumulates intracellularly when overexpressed in the liver cells of mature mice and is apparently not normally processed/secreted. However, also repeated intraperitoneal injections were without effects on body weight and insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue UCP1 levels were only marginally reduced. These results suggest that mature mice do not readily respond to GREMLIN 1 but treatment of murine cells with GREMLIN 1 protein in vitro validated its inhibitory effect on BMP4 signalling while insulin signalling was not altered."
https://openalex.org/W3133246988,"Assessment of resource partitioning in pollinators at a particular place can be used to conserve plant communities by minimizing their inter-specific competition. Current study was conducted to investigate the occurrence of this phenomenon among plant communities under sub-tropical conditions for the first time in Pakistan. We considered the entire available flowering plant and floral visitor communities in the study area—Lal Suhanra forest of Bahawalpur, Pakistan- along with different variations among them based on morphology, color and symmetry (functional groups) i.e. four functional groups among insects and nine among plants. Weekly floral visitor censuses were conducted during spring season -from the first week of March to the fourth week of May 2018. Thirty individuals of each plant species -in bloom- were observed for floral visitors in each census. Plant species with different floral shapes, colors and symmetry did not show any significant resource partitioning. The Non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis followed by one-way ANOSIM test showed non- significant differences among all the pair of floral shapes, colors (except white and yellow) and symmetry (R-value &lt; 0.168). However, SIMPER test suggested that flies were the most common group that contributed more towards within group similarities of different floral shapes (19 to 21% similarity), colors (16 to 30%) and symmetry (19%) followed by long-tongue bees i.e. 14 to 21%, 9 to 19% and 18%, respectively. Our results suggest that plant communities under sub-tropical conditions of Pakistan exhibit a generalist pollination system with no significant resource partitioning in pollinator species. Therefore, plant communities may have high competition for pollinator species which exhibits fewer implications of species loss on overall pollination process. Our study provides the basis for understanding the partitioning of pollinator guilds under sub-tropical conditions. Future studies should focus on functional traits in more detail at the community and the population scales for their possible impact on resource partitioning."
