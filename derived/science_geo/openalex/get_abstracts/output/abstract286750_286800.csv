Thanks are due all of those who contributed to the social enjoyment and the scientific accomplishments of the congress, but it may be permissible to emphasize the part played by the general president, Dr. Otto de Vries. He showed capacity in the organization of the congress, his handling of all matters connected with it was tactful and his genial personality endeared him to every one. We congratulated him on his success and told him that we were proud of him."

The results are so interesting, especially in structural differentiation between the ether-soluble (sol-rubber) and the ether-insoluble (gel-rubber) hydrocarbons, and in producing new data bearing upon the several theories of the structure of whole rubber, that it has seemed desirable to record very briefly some of the more important observations. It will be recalled that native rubber, raw, purified, or vulcanized, gives a typical liquid halo or “amorphous” type of diffraction pattern in the unstretched condition, which changes to the characteristic crystal fiber pattern when the rubber specimen is stretched. Upon the basis of these facts, several theories of the structure of the rubber hydrocarbon have been proposed: the folded or spiral molecules model; the fringe model (bundles of molecular..."
