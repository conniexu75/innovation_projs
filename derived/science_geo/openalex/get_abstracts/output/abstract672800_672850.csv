https://openalex.org/W3159494124,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an abundant internal RNA modification1,2 that is catalysed predominantly by the METTL3–METTL14 methyltransferase complex3,4. The m6A methyltransferase METTL3 has been linked to the initiation and maintenance of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the potential of therapeutic applications targeting this enzyme remains unknown5–7. Here we present the identification and characterization of STM2457, a highly potent and selective first-in-class catalytic inhibitor of METTL3, and a crystal structure of STM2457 in complex with METTL3–METTL14. Treatment of tumours with STM2457 leads to reduced AML growth and an increase in differentiation and apoptosis. These cellular effects are accompanied by selective reduction of m6A levels on known leukaemogenic mRNAs and a decrease in their expression consistent with a translational defect. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of METTL3 in vivo leads to impaired engraftment and prolonged survival in various mouse models of AML, specifically targeting key stem cell subpopulations of AML. Collectively, these results reveal the inhibition of METTL3 as a potential therapeutic strategy against AML, and provide proof of concept that the targeting of RNA-modifying enzymes represents a promising avenue for anticancer therapy. Treatment with a specific inhibitor of the N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase METTL3 leads to reduced growth of cancer cells, indicating the potential of approaches targeting RNA-modifying enzymes for anticancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W3157166585,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection has become a clinical threat to healthy people as well as immunocompromised patients and those with pre-existing chronic diseases around the world. This study, which used a cross-sectional correlational design, aimed to assess the levels of fear and health anxiety and to investigate their predictors during the current outbreak of COVID-19 in immunocompromised and chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia. Sociodemographic and clinical data, fear of COVID-19, and health anxiety measurements were collected by online surveys from June 15 to July 15, 2020. Univariate and multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify predictors. A total of 1,030 patients in 13 provinces in Saudi Arabia completed the questionnaire. A significant number of patients with chronic diseases experienced considerable levels of fear and anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak. It was found that 21.44% of participants met the criteria for anxiety cases, and 19.4% were considered borderline anxiety cases. In regression analysis, significant predictors of fear and health anxiety were female gender, lower education, middle-aged, divorced or widowed, receiving immunosuppressants, type of chronic disease (Crohn’s disease, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases), and media use as a source of knowledge about COVID-19. Immunocompromised and chronic disease patients are vulnerable to fear and anxiety during epidemic infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Optimizing this population’s compliance with appropriate infection prevention and control strategies is crucial during the infectious outbreaks to ensure their safety, to decrease the risk of infection and serious complications, and reduce their fear and health anxiety. Effective positive psychological interventions and support strategies also need to be immediately implemented to increase psychological resilience and improve the mental health of these patients. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, chronic disease patients in Saudi Arabia need special attention from health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to manage maladaptive forms of health anxiety and fear."

https://openalex.org/W3158384274,"The L-arabinose-responsive AraC and its cognate PBAD promoter underlie one of the most often used chemically inducible prokaryotic gene expression systems in microbiology and synthetic biology. Here, we change the sensing capability of AraC from L-arabinose to blue light, making its dimerization and the resulting PBAD activation light-inducible. We engineer an entire family of blue light-inducible AraC dimers in Escherichia coli (BLADE) to control gene expression in space and time. We show that BLADE can be used with pre-existing L-arabinose-responsive plasmids and strains, enabling optogenetic experiments without the need to clone. Furthermore, we apply BLADE to control, with light, the catabolism of L-arabinose, thus externally steering bacterial growth with a simple transformation step. Our work establishes BLADE as a highly practical and effective optogenetic tool with plug-and-play functionality-features that we hope will accelerate the broader adoption of optogenetics and the realization of its vast potential in microbiology, synthetic biology and biotechnology."
https://openalex.org/W3159705451,"Many decisions under uncertainty entail the temporal accumulation of evidence that informs about the state of the environment. When environments are subject to hidden changes in their state, maximizing accuracy and reward requires non-linear accumulation of evidence. How this adaptive, non-linear computation is realized in the brain is unknown. We analyzed human behavior and cortical population activity (measured with magnetoencephalography) recorded during visual evidence accumulation in a changing environment. Behavior and decision-related activity in cortical regions involved in action planning exhibited hallmarks of adaptive evidence accumulation, which could also be implemented by a recurrent cortical microcircuit. Decision dynamics in action-encoding parietal and frontal regions were mirrored in a frequency-specific modulation of the state of the visual cortex that depended on pupil-linked arousal and the expected probability of change. These findings link normative decision computations to recurrent cortical circuit dynamics and highlight the adaptive nature of decision-related feedback to the sensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3157221302,"Social-distancing directives to contain community transmission of the COVID-19 virus can be expected to affect sleep timing, duration or quality. Remote work or school may increase time available for sleep, with benefits for immune function and mental health, particularly in those individuals who obtain less sleep than age-adjusted recommendations. Young adults are thought to regularly carry significant sleep debt related in part to misalignment between endogenous circadian clock time and social time. We examined the impact of social-distancing measures on sleep in young adults by comparing sleep self-studies submitted by students enrolled in a university course during the 2020 summer session (entirely remote instruction, N = 80) with self-studies submitted by students enrolled in the same course during previous summer semesters (on-campus instruction, N = 452; cross-sectional study design). Self-studies included 2–8 week sleep diaries, two chronotype questionnaires, written reports, and sleep tracker (Fitbit) data from a subsample. Students in the 2020 remote instruction semester slept later, less efficiently, less at night and more in the day, but did not sleep more overall despite online, asynchronous classes and ~44% fewer work days compared to students in previous summers. Subjectively, the net impact on sleep was judged as positive or negative in equal numbers of students, with students identifying as evening types significantly more likely to report a positive impact, and morning types a negative impact. Several features of the data suggest that the average amount of sleep reported by students in this summer course, historically and during the 2020 remote school semester, represents a homeostatic balance, rather than a chronic deficit. Regardless of the interpretation, the results provide additional evidence that social-distancing measures affect sleep in heterogeneous ways."
https://openalex.org/W3158700720,"Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare, but aggressive entity of breast carcinoma with rapid dermal lymphatic invasion in young females. It is either poorly or misdiagnosed as mastitis because of the absence of a distinct lump. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) circulating in liquid biopsies are a novel class of minimally invasive diagnostic alternative to invasive tissue biopsies. They modulate cancer progression via shuttling their encapsulated cargo including microRNAs (miRNAs) into recipient cells to either trigger signaling or induce malignant transformation of targeted cells. Plasma sEVs &lt; 200 nm were isolated using a modified cost-effective polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based precipitation method and compared to standard methods, namely ultracentrifugation and a commercial kit, where the successful isolation was verified by different approaches. We evaluated the expression levels of selected sEV-derived miR-181b-5p, miR-222-3p and let-7a-5p using quantitative real PCR (qPCR). Relative to non-IBC, our qPCR data showed that sEV-derived miR-181b-5p and miR-222-3p were significantly upregulated, whereas let-7a-5p was downregulated in IBC patients. Interestingly, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis revealed that diagnostic accuracy of let-7a-5p alone was the highest for IBC with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.9188, and when combined with miR-222-3p the AUC was improved to 0.973. Further, 38 hub genes were identified using bioinformatics analysis. Together, circulating sEV-derived miR-181b-5p, miR-222-3p and let-7a-5p serve as promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for IBC."
https://openalex.org/W3157110022,"Phospholipase C β (PLCβ), which is activated by the Gq family of heterotrimeric G proteins, hydrolyzes the inner membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), generating diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3). Because Gq and PLCβ regulate many crucial cellular processes and have been identified as major disease drivers, activation and termination of PLCβ signaling by the Gαq subunit have been extensively studied. Gq-coupled receptor activation induces intense and transient PIP2 hydrolysis, which subsequently recovers to a low-intensity steady-state equilibrium. However, the molecular underpinnings of this equilibrium remain unclear. Here, we explored the influence of signaling crosstalk between Gq and Gi/o pathways on PIP2 metabolism in living cells using single-cell and optogenetic approaches to spatially and temporally constrain signaling. Our data suggest that the Gβγ complex is a component of the highly efficient lipase GαqGTP–PLCβ–Gβγ. We found that over time, Gβγ dissociates from this lipase complex, leaving the less-efficient GαqGTP–PLCβ lipase complex and allowing the significant partial recovery of PIP2 levels. Our findings also indicate that the subtype of the Gγ subunit in Gβγ fine-tunes the lipase activity of Gq–PLCβ, in which cells expressing Gγ with higher plasma membrane interaction show lower PIP2 recovery. Given that Gγ shows cell- and tissue-specific subtype expression, our findings suggest the existence of tissue-specific distinct Gq–PLCβ signaling paradigms. Furthermore, these results also outline a molecular process that likely safeguards cells from excessive Gq signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3158926467,"Maintaining genome integrity is particularly important in germ cells to ensure faithful transmission of genetic information across generations. Here we systematically describe germ cell mutagenesis in wild-type and 61 DNA repair mutants cultivated over multiple generations. ~44% of the DNA repair mutants analysed showed a >2-fold increased mutagenesis with a broad spectrum of mutational outcomes. Nucleotide excision repair deficiency led to higher base substitution rates, whereas polh-1(Polη) and rev-3(Polζ) translesion synthesis polymerase mutants resulted in 50-400 bp deletions. Signatures associated with defective homologous recombination fall into two classes: 1) brc-1/BRCA1 and rad-51/RAD51 paralog mutants showed increased mutations across all mutation classes, 2) mus-81/MUS81 and slx-1/SLX1 nuclease, and him-6/BLM, helq-1/HELQ or rtel-1/RTEL1 helicase mutants primarily accumulated structural variants. Repetitive and G-quadruplex sequence-containing loci were more frequently mutated in specific DNA repair backgrounds. Tandem duplications embedded in inverted repeats were observed in helq-1 helicase mutants, and a unique pattern of 'translocations' involving homeologous sequences occurred in rip-1 recombination mutants. atm-1/ATM checkpoint mutants harboured structural variants specifically enriched in subtelomeric regions. Interestingly, locally clustered mutagenesis was only observed for combined brc-1 and cep-1/p53 deficiency. Our study provides a global view of how different DNA repair pathways contribute to prevent germ cell mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3159288848,"This study describes the fecal microbiota from piglets reared in different living environments during the weaning transition, and presents the characteristics of microbiota associated with good growth of piglets after weaning. Fecal samples were collected pre- (d26) and post-weaning (d35) from 288 male piglets in 16 conventional indoor commercial farms located in the West of France. The changes one week after weaning on the most abundant microbial families was roughly the same in all farms: alpha diversity increased, the relative abundance of Bacteroidaceae (-61%), Christensenellaceae (-35%), Enterobacteriaceae (-42%), and Clostridiaceae (-32%) decreased, while the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae (+143%) and Lachnospiraceae (+21%) increased. Among all the collected samples, four enterotypes that were ubiquitous in all farms were identified. They could be discriminated by their respective relative abundances of Prevotella , Faecalibacterium , Roseburia , and Lachnospira , and likely corresponded to a gradual maturational shift from pre- to post-weaning microbiota. The rearing environment influenced the frequency of enterotypes, as well as the relative abundance of 6 families at d26 (including Christensenellaceae and Lactobacillaceae ), and of 21 families at d35. In all farms, piglets showing the highest relative growth rate during the first three weeks after weaning, which were characterized as more robust, had a higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes , a lower relative abundance of Proteobacteria , and showed a greater increase in Prevotella , Coprococcus , and Lachnospira in the post-weaning period. This study revealed the presence of ubiquitous enterotypes among the farms of this study, reflecting maturational stages of microbiota from a young suckling to an older cereal-eating profile. Despite significant variation in the microbial profile between farms, piglets whose growth after weaning was less disrupted were, those who had reached the more mature phenotype characterized by Prevotella the fastest."
https://openalex.org/W3158747484,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common chronic sleep disorder that disrupts breathing during sleep and is associated with many other medical conditions, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, and depression. Clinically, the standard for diagnosing OSA involves nocturnal polysomnography (PSG). However, this requires expert human intervention and considerable time, which limits the availability of OSA diagnosis in public health sectors. Therefore, electrocardiogram (ECG)-based methods for OSA detection have been proposed to automate the polysomnography procedure and reduce its discomfort. So far, most of the proposed approaches rely on feature engineering, which calls for advanced expert knowledge and experience. This paper proposes a novel fused-image-based technique that detects OSA using only a single-lead ECG signal. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network extracts features automatically from images created with one-minute ECG segments. The proposed network comprises 37 layers, including four residual blocks, a dense layer, a dropout layer, and a soft-max layer. In this study, three time-frequency representations, namely the scalogram, the spectrogram, and the Wigner-Ville distribution, were used to investigate the effectiveness of the fused-image-based approach. We found that blending scalogram and spectrogram images further improved the system's discriminative characteristics. Seventy ECG recordings from the PhysioNet Apnea-ECG database were used to train and evaluate the proposed model using 10-fold cross validation. The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed classifier can perform OSA detection with an average accuracy, recall, and specificity of 92.4%, 92.3%, and 92.6%, respectively, for the fused spectral images."
https://openalex.org/W3157214988,"Background Data on the burden of dyslipidaemia among people with HIV undergoing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa are limited and little is known about the factors contributing for poor lipid profiles. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of dyslipidaemia and factors associated with lipid levels among HIV-infected patients receiving first-line combination ART in North Shewa, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between April and December 2018 among 392 HIV-infected adults receiving first-line ART for at least six months at the ART clinic of Mehal Meda Hospital in North Shewa, Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected for determination of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and CD4 counts. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with lipid abnormalities. Results The prevalence of dyslipidaemia was 59.9% (95% CI 55.0–64.7%). High TC, high TG, low HDL-c, and high LDL-c were obtained in 47.3%, 30.9%, 19.4% and 29.6%, respectively. Fifty-four participants (13.8%) had high ratio of TC/HDL-c (TC/HDL-c ratio ≥ 5). Older age was independently associated with high TC (AOR = 2.51, 95% CI 1.64–3.84), high TG (AOR = 2.95, 95% CI 1.85–4.71), low HDL–c (AOR = 2.02, 95% CI 1.17–3.50), and high LDL–c (AOR = 3.37, 95% CI 2.08–5.47). Living in an urban area (AOR = 2.61, 95% CI 1.16–6.14) and smoking (AOR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.06–12.34) were associated with low HDL–c. Participants with longer duration of ART use were more likely to have high TG (AOR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.13–3.07), low HDL–c (AOR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.75–6.80), and high LDL–c (AOR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.30–3.71). High BMI was independently associated with higher TC (AOR = 2.43, 95% CI 1.19–4.97), high TG (AOR = 4.17, 95% CI 2.01–8.67) and high LDL–c (AOR = 6.53, 95% CI 3.05–13.98). Conclusions We found a high prevalence of dyslipidaemia among HIV-infected patients receiving first-line ART in North Shewa, Ethiopia. There is a need for monitoring of blood lipid levels in patients with HIV on long term first-line ART with a special attention to be focused on older age, urban residents, longer duration of ART use, high BMI and smokers."
https://openalex.org/W3158737133,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and lung cancer share common risk factors, epigenetic and genetic alterations, the activation of similar signaling pathways and poor survival. The aim of this study was to examine the gene expression profiles of stromal cells from patients with IPF and lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) as well as from normal lung. The gene expression levels of cultured stromal cells derived from non-smoking patients with ADC from the tumor (n = 4) and the corresponding normal lung (n = 4) as well as from patients with IPF (n = 4) were investigated with Affymetrix microarrays. The expression of collagen type IV alpha 1 chain, periostin as well as matrix metalloproteinase-1 and -3 in stromal cells and lung tissues were examined with quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Twenty genes were similarly up- or down-regulated in IPF and ADC compared to control, while most of the altered genes in IPF and ADC were differently expressed, including several extracellular matrix genes. Collagen type IV alpha 1 chain as well as matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -3 were differentially expressed in IPF compared to ADC. Periostin was up-regulated in both IPF and ADC in comparison to control. All studied factors were localized by immunohistochemistry in stromal cells within fibroblast foci in IPF and stroma of ADC. Despite the similarities found in gene expressions of IPF and ADC, several differences were also detected, suggesting that the molecular changes occurring in these two lung illnesses are somewhat different."
https://openalex.org/W3158116577,"Background Although several groups reported the risk factors for slow flow during rotational atherectomy (RA), they did not clearly distinguish modifiable factors, such as burr-to-artery ratio from unmodifiable ones, such as lesion length. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the modifiable and unmodifiable factors that were associated with slow flow. Methods We included 513 lesions treated with RA, which were classified into a slow flow group (n = 97) and a non-slow flow group (n = 416) according to the presence or absence of slow flow just after RA. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to find factors associated with slow flow. Results Slow flow was inversely associated with reference diameter [Odds ratio (OR) 0.351, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.205–0.600, p &lt;0.001], primary RA strategy (OR 0.224, 95% CI 0.097–0.513, p &lt;0.001), short single run (≤15 seconds) (OR 0.458, 95% CI 0.271–0.776, p = 0.004), and systolic blood pressure (BP) ≥ 140 mmHg (OR 0.501, 95% CI 0.297–0.843, p = 0.009). Lesion length (every 5 mm increase: OR 1.193, 95% CI 1.093–1.301, p &lt;0.001), angulation (OR 2.054, 95% CI 1.171–3.601, p = 0.012), halfway RA (OR 2.027, 95% CI 1.130–3.635, p = 0.018), initial burr-to-artery ratio (OR 1.451, 95% CI 1.212–1.737, p &lt;0.001), and use of beta blockers (OR 1.894, 95% CI 1.004–3.573, p = 0.049) were significantly associated with slow flow. Conclusions Slow flow was positively associated with several unmodifiable factors including lesion length and angulation, and inversely associated with reference diameter. In addition, slow flow was positively associated with several modifiable factors including initial burr-to-artery ratio and use of beta blockers, and inversely associated with primary RA strategy, short single run, and systolic blood pressure just before RA. Application of this information could help to improve RA procedures."
https://openalex.org/W3159279855,"Insect microbial symbioses play a critical role in insect lifecycle, and insect gut microbiome could be influenced by many factors. Studies have shown that host diet and taxonomy have a strong influence on insect gut microbial community. In this study, we performed sequencing of V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA gene to compare the composition and diversity of 12 Ensifera from 6 provinces of China. Moreover, the influences of feeding habits and taxonomic status of insects on their gut bacterial community were evaluated, which might provide reference for further application research. The results showed that Proteobacteria (45.66%), Firmicutes (34.25%) and Cyanobacteria (7.7%) were the predominant bacterial phyla in Ensifera. Moreover, the gut bacterial community composition of samples with different feeding habits was significantly different, which was irrespective of their taxa. The highest diversity of gut bacteria was found in the omnivorous Ensifera. Furthermore, common and unique bacteria with biomarkers were found based on the dietary characteristics of the samples. However, the bacterial community structure of the Ensifera samples was significantly different from that of Caelifera. Therefore, we concluded that feeding habits and taxonomic status jointly affect the gut bacterial community composition of the samples from Orthoptera. However, the influence of feeding habit dominates when taxonomy category below the suborder level. In addition, the dominant, common and unique bacterial community structure could be used to predict the contrastic feeding habits of insects belonging to Ensifera."
https://openalex.org/W3159598210,"Background Despite decades of extensive research, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains the most devastating disease in beef cattle production. Establishing a clinical diagnosis often relies upon visual detection of non-specific signs, leading to low diagnostic accuracy. Thus, post-weaned beef cattle are often metaphylactically administered antimicrobials at facility arrival, which poses concerns regarding antimicrobial stewardship and resistance. Additionally, there is a lack of high-quality research that addresses the gene-by-environment interactions that underlie why some cattle that develop BRD die while others survive. Therefore, it is necessary to decipher the underlying host genomic factors associated with BRD mortality versus survival to help determine BRD risk and severity. Using transcriptomic analysis of at-arrival whole blood samples from cattle that died of BRD, as compared to those that developed signs of BRD but lived (n = 3 DEAD, n = 3 ALIVE), we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and associated pathways in cattle that died of BRD. Additionally, we evaluated unmapped reads, which are often overlooked within transcriptomic experiments. Results 69 DEGs (FDR&lt;0.10) were identified between ALIVE and DEAD cohorts. Several DEGs possess immunological and proinflammatory function and associations with TLR4 and IL6. Biological processes, pathways, and disease phenotype associations related to type-I interferon production and antiviral defense were enriched in DEAD cattle at arrival. Unmapped reads aligned primarily to various ungulate assemblies, but failed to align to viral assemblies. Conclusion This study further revealed increased proinflammatory immunological mechanisms in cattle that develop BRD. DEGs upregulated in DEAD cattle were predominantly involved in innate immune pathways typically associated with antiviral defense, although no viral genes were identified within unmapped reads. Our findings provide genomic targets for further analysis in cattle at highest risk of BRD, suggesting that mechanisms related to type I interferons and antiviral defense may be indicative of viral respiratory disease at arrival and contribute to eventual BRD mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3159893078,"Objectives Using the person-environment (PE) fit theory, this study aims to explore factors affecting medical professionals’ job satisfaction, turnover intention, and professional efficacy, and to examine individual characters associated with PE fit. Design and methods This study used data from the sixth National Health Service Survey conducted in 2018, with a focus on job outcomes among medical professionals in Shanghai. The reliability and validity of the tools for measuring PE and job outcomes were calculated. A structural equation model was used to examine the relationship among person-job (PJ) fit and person-group (PG) fit, job satisfaction, turnover intention, and professional efficacy. Finally, a hierarchical regression model was used to analyze the association between demographic variables and the PJ and PG fit. Results PG fit was directly and positively associated with job satisfaction and professional efficacy. PJ fit had a direct and positive association with job satisfaction but had a direct and negative association with turnover intention. The indirect association of PJ fit with turnover intention was statistically significant. The results from the hierarchical regression analysis showed that younger physicians generally had a lower level of PJ fit and older physicians with higher education tended to have a lower level of PG fit. Conclusions Medical professionals with higher PJ or PG fit have higher job satisfaction, and those with higher PG fit have higher professional efficacy. The impact of PJ fit on turnover intention was mediated by job satisfaction. Healthcare managers should take actions to effectively promote medical professionals’ PJ and PG fit to improve their retention and efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W3159782382,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health challenge with approximately 250–350 million chronically infected individuals. An improved understanding of the demographic features and outcomes of chronic HBV infection and hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection in low-endemic areas may improve prevention, early identification and management both at individual and community levels. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment rates and outcomes of adult patients with chronic HBV infection with or without HDV coinfection examined at Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland over a 10-year period. Methods We analyzed the medical records of all adult patients with chronic HBV and HDV infection examined in our center between 2007 and 2016. Liver-related outcome was defined as the occurrence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation or liver-related death. Analyses were performed using logistic regression and results were reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Of 672 consecutive patients, 421 (62.6%) were male, median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 28–46 years), and 233 (34.7%) were of African origin. The prevalence of HDV coinfection was 7.1% and the proportion of anti-HDV-positive patients with detectable HDV RNA was 70.0%. In multivariate analysis, HDV coinfection was the strongest predictor for liver-related outcome (OR 6.06, 95% CI 2.93–12.54, p&lt;0.001), followed by HBeAg positivity (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.30–4.69, p = 0.006), age (OR per 10-year increase 2.03, 95% CI 1.63–2.52, p&lt;0.001) and sex (OR for female 0.39, 95% CI 0.22–0.71, p = 0.002). The predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was high (receiver operator characteristic area under the curve 0.81). Conclusion This retrospective study underscores the importance of migration in the epidemiology of chronic hepatitis B in low-endemic areas. HDV coinfection, HBeAg positivity and age predicted liver-related outcomes while female sex had a protective effect."
https://openalex.org/W3159059380,"Accurate prediction of cancer stage is important in that it enables more appropriate treatment for patients with cancer. Many measures or methods have been proposed for more accurate prediction of cancer stage, but recently, machine learning, especially deep learning-based methods have been receiving increasing attention, mostly owing to their good prediction accuracy in many applications. Machine learning methods can be applied to high throughput DNA mutation or RNA expression data to predict cancer stage. However, because the number of genes or markers generally exceeds 10,000, a considerable number of data samples is required to guarantee high prediction accuracy. To solve this problem of a small number of clinical samples, we used a Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to augment the samples. Because GANs are not effective with whole genes, we first selected significant genes using DNA mutation data and random forest feature ranking. Next, RNA expression data for selected genes were expanded using GANs. We compared the classification accuracies using original dataset and expanded datasets generated by proposed and existing methods, using random forest, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and 1-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1DCNN). When using the 1DCNN, the F1 score of GAN5 (a 5-fold increase in data) was improved by 39% in relation to the original data. Moreover, the results using only 30% of the data were better than those using all of the data. Our attempt is the first to use GAN for augmentation using numeric data for both DNA and RNA. The augmented datasets obtained using the proposed method demonstrated significantly increased classification accuracy for most cases. By using GAN and 1DCNN in the prediction of cancer stage, we confirmed that good results can be obtained even with small amounts of samples, and it is expected that a great deal of the cost and time required to obtain clinical samples will be reduced. The proposed sample augmentation method could also be applied for other purposes, such as prognostic prediction or cancer classification."
https://openalex.org/W3159151385,"Background Surgical site infection (SSI) is a serious public health problem due to its impacts on maternal morbidity and mortality and it can have a significant effect on quality of life for the patient. However, little has been studied regarding the magnitude and factors associated with SSI among women underwent cesarean delivery (CD) in study area. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude and factors associated with SSI among women underwent cesarean delivery in Nekemte Town Public Hospitals 2020. Methods An institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1/2018 to January 1/2020. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select 401 patient cards from all records women underwent CD from January 1/2018 to January 1/2020. Epidata version 3.2 was used for data entry, and STATA version 14 was used for analysis. A logistic regression model was used to determine the association of independent variables with the outcome variable and adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the strength of the association. Results Three hundred eight two (382) cards of women were selected for analysis making a response rate of 95.2%. The mean (±SD) age of the mothers was 25.9 (±4.8) years. The prevalence of SSIs was 8.9% (95% CI: 6.03, 11.76). Age &gt; 35 years (AOR = 5.03, 95% CI:1.69, 14.95), pregnancy-induced hypertension (AOR = 5.63, 95%CI:1.88, 16.79), prolonged labor (AOR = 4.12, 95% CI:1.01, 32.19), receiving general anesthesia (AOR = 3.96 95% CI:1.02, 15.29), and post-operative hemoglobin less than 11 g/dl (AOR = 4.51 95% CI:1.84, 11.07) were significantly associated with the occurrence of SSI after cesarean delivery. Conclusions and recommendations The magnitude of post CD SSI in this study was comparable with the sphere standards of CDC guidelines for SSI after CD. Concerned bodies should give due attention the proper utilization of partograph to prevent prolonged labor, and provision of iron folate to increase the hemoglobin level of pregnant mothers in all health institution. In addition, we would recommend the use of spinal anesthesia over general anesthesia."
https://openalex.org/W3159180652,"Background Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA) is reportedly high in pregnant adults and the causes well studied. However, among pregnant teenagers, the levels and associated factors of IDA are not fully understood. Methods In a prospective cohort study among Ghanaian pregnant teenagers, aged 13–19 years, IDA prevalence and associated factors were investigated. Sociodemographic data, household hunger scale (HHS), lived poverty index (LPI), FAO’s women’s dietary diversity score (WDDS) and interventions received during antenatal care (ANC) were obtained from 416 pregnant teenagers in Ashanti Region, Ghana. Micronutrient intakes using a repeated 24-hour dietary recall, and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) were determined and blood samples analysed for haemoglobin (Hb), serum levels of ferritin, prealbumin, vitamin A, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP). Results Anaemia (Hb cutoff &lt;11.0 g/dL) was 57.1%; deficient systemic supply of iron stores (31.4%), depleted body stores of iron (4.4%), inadequate dietary iron intake (94.5%), and inadequate multiple micronutrient intakes (49.5%), were all notable among study participants. Between-subject effects using Generalized Linear Modelling indicated malaria tablet given at ANC (p = 0.035), MUAC (p = 0.043), ZPP (p&lt;0.001), ZPP/Hb ratio (p&lt;0.001) and depleted body iron stores (DBIS) (p&lt;0.001) to significantly affect Hb levels. Pregnant teenagers with a high ZPP/Hb ratio (OR = 9.7, p&lt;0.001, 95%CI = 6.0–15.8) had increased odds of being anaemic compared to those with normal ZPP/Hb ratio. Participants who were wasted (OR = 1.2, p = 0.543, 95%CI = 0.6–2.3), and those with depleted iron stores (OR = 3.0, p = 0.167, 95%CI = 0.6–14.6) had increased odds of being anaemic. Participants who experienced hunger were close to 3 times more likely (OR = 2.9, p = 0.040, 95%CI = 1.1–7.8) for depleted iron stores, compared to those who did not experience hunger. Also, participants with inadequate multiple micronutrients intakes (OR = 2.6, p = 0.102, 95%CI = 0.8–8.4), and those with low serum levels of ferritin (OR = 3.3, p = 0.291, 95%CI = 0.4–29.2) had increased odds of depleted body iron stores. Conclusions IDA is common among pregnant teenagers and the related factors include malaria tablets given at ANC, maternal hunger, maternal MUAC, a deficient systemic supply of iron, depleted body iron stores, ZPP, and ZPP/Hb ratio. Appropriate interventions are urgently needed to address the causes of IDA among pregnant teenagers."
https://openalex.org/W3157565064,"Introduction Pregnant women who disclose their HIV-positive status to their sexual partners have played an important role in reducing the risk of HIV/AIDS transmission to the baby during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postnatal periods. Studies are limited in the current study area in a similar arena. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the proportion of HIV-positive status disclosure and its associated factors among pregnant women. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 156 HIV-positive pregnant women in Dire Dawa administrative from March 12 th to May 10 th , 2020. Data were generated using a pretested structured questionnaire through face-to-face interviews. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the predictor variables associated with the disclosure of HIV-positive status among pregnant women to their sexual partners. Finally, the adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals at P-value&lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the total, 135 (86.5%) of HIV-positive pregnant women disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partner. Christian followers (both Orthodox and Protestant) [AOR = 8.8, 95% CI: 2.3. 34] more likely to disclose HIV status to their sexual partner than those Muslims. Those participants who started practicing safer sex [AOR = 17.6, 95% CI: 4–77] and those women who had a smooth relationship before the HIV disclosure were [AOR = 14.7, 95% CI: 3–68.6] more likely to disclose HIV status to their sexual partner than their counterparts, respectively. Conclusions The proportion of HIV serostatus disclosure by HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care services to their sexual partners was encouraging. However, this does not mean that there is no need for further awareness and intervention. Hence, interventions to boost and support women in safely disclosing their HIV-positive status are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3157995261,"About a third of the plant basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) transcription factors harbor a C-terminal aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA (ACT)-like domain, which was originally identified in the maize R regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis, where it modulates the ability of the bHLH to dimerize and bind DNA. Characterization of other bHLH ACT-like domains, such as the one in the Arabidopsis R ortholog, GL3, has not definitively confirmed dimerization, raising the question of the overall role of this potential regulatory domain. To learn more, we compared the dimerization of the ACT-like domains of R (RACT) and GL3 (GL3ACT). We show that RACT dimerizes with a dissociation constant around 100 nM, over an order of magnitude stronger than GL3ACT. Structural predictions combined with mutational analyses demonstrated that V568, located in a hydrophobic pocket in RACT, is important: when mutated to the Ser residue present in GL3ACT, dimerization affinity dropped by almost an order of magnitude. The converse S595V mutation in GL3ACT significantly increased the dimerization strength. We cloned and assayed dimerization for all identified maize ACT-like domains and determined that 12 of 42 formed heterodimers in yeast two-hybrid assays, irrespective of whether they harbored V568, which was often replaced by other aliphatic amino acids. Moreover, we determined that the presence of polar residues at that position occurs only in a small subset of anthocyanin regulators. The combined results provide new insights into possibly regulatory mechanisms and suggest that many of the other plant ACT-like domains associate to modulate fundamental cellular processes.

The combined results provide new insights into possibly regulatory mechanisms and suggest that many of the other plant ACT-like domains associate to modulate fundamental cellular processes. Control of gene expression relies on the proper organization of transcription factors (TFs) and other proteins on gene regulatory regions. This is largely accomplished through protein–DNA and protein–protein interactions (PPIs). Thus, in addition to harboring DNA-binding domains that interpret the cis-regulatory code in the genome, TFs are characterized by the presence of one or more PPI domains. The same TF can regulate different sets of genes in different cell types or conditions, a consequence of their ability to form different complexes as part of what is known as combinatorial control (1Brkljacic J. Grotewold E. Combinatorial control of plant gene expression.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gene Regul. Mech. 2017; 1860: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, determining how PPI domains participate in TF assembly is fundamental to understand gene regulation. The basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) family of TFs is among the largest in animals (2Lambert S.A. Jolma A. Campitelli L.F. Das P.K. Yin Y. Albu M. Chen X. Taipale J. Hughes T.R. Weirauch M.T. The human transcription factors.Cell. 2018; 172: 650-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) and plants (3Feller A. Machemer K. Braun E.L. Grotewold E. Evolutionary and comparative analysis of MYB and bHLH plant transcription factors.Plant J. 2011; 66: 94-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The bHLH domain is structurally conserved, and it is about 60 amino acids long organized into two functionally distinct regions (4Ferré-D'Amaré A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Recognition by Max of its cognate DNA through a dimeric b/HLH/Z domain.Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 5Ma P.C.M. Rould M.A. Weintraub H. Pabo C.O. Crystal structure of MyoD bHLH domain-DNA complex: Perspectives on DNA recognition and implications for transcriptional activation.Cell. 1994; 77: 451-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The N-terminal basic region is responsible for binding to the canonical E-box DNA motif (CANNTG), but DNA recognition requires the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other bHLH proteins, and such PPIs are mediated by the HLH region (6Massari M.E. Murre C. Helix-loop-helix proteins: Regulators of transcription in eucaryotic organisms.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). In addition to the bHLH domain, members of this TF family often harbor other conserved motifs that participate in PPIs and that have contributed to the classification of the family (3Feller A. Machemer K. Braun E.L. Grotewold E. Evolutionary and comparative analysis of MYB and bHLH plant transcription factors.Plant J. 2011; 66: 94-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 7Pires N.

Some of these motifs are shared between plant and animal bHLH TFs, such as the leucine zipper motif that is often present immediately C terminal to the second helix of the HLH motif, and are important in stabilizing bHLH-mediated dimer formation and providing DNA-binding specificity to the homodimers or heterodimers (9Blackwood E.M.

Other motifs appear to be specific to the plant kingdom and include the ACT-like domain, a fold first identified in the aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase, and TyrA enzymes (hence the name, ACT) (12Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Eukaryotic transcription regulators derive from ancient enzymatic domains.Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R111-R113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and later shown to be present in about a third of the plant bHLH TFs (13Feller A. Hernandez J.M. Grotewold E.

REPLY: The BIF domain is structurally and functionally distinct from other types of ACT-like domains.Plant Cell. 2017; 29: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), the ACT-like domain can mediate PPIs (13Feller A.

ACT domains are 70 to 80 amino acids long and have primarily been found in proteins involved in the regulation or biosynthesis of amino acids. When part of enzymes, they can participate in allosteric regulation by pathway intermediates, frequently involving the formation of homodimers, or higher order structures (17Cho Y. Sharma V.

Several ACT structures have been solved, some bound to ligands (18Grant G.A. The ACT domain: A small molecule binding domain and its role as a common regulatory element.J. Biol.

Biochem. 2008; 46: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), although flexibility in the structure of the domain is becoming evident as more structures are solved (20Gai Z. Wang Q. Yang C.

Maize R was the first plant bHLH regulator identified (23Ludwig R. Habera L.F. Dellaporta S.L. Wessler S.R. Lc, a member of the maize R gene family responsible for tissue-specific anthocyanin production, encodes a protein similar to transcriptional activators and contains the myc-homology region.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13579-13584Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). R homodimer formation and DNA binding require an extended bHLH that includes a short leucine zipper motif but is inhibited by dimerization of the C-terminal ACT-like domain, which has a ββαββα organization (26Kong Q.

A. 2012; 109: E2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, the R ACT-like domain functions as a regulatory switch that dictates whether R-containing regulatory complexes are tethered to target genes through the bHLH or through the R2R3–MYB partner (26Kong Q. Pattanaik S. Feller A. Werkman J.R. Chai C. Wang Y. Grotewold E. Yuan L.

Regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway by the TTG1/bHLH/Myb transcriptional complex in Arabidopsis seedlings.Plant J. 2008; 53: 814-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), by interacting with different R2R3–MYB proteins, participating in the formation of different MYB, bHLH, and WD (tryptophan–aspartic acid repeat-containing proteins) complexes (33Lloyd A.

Notwithstanding the very similar domain structure of GL3/EGL3 and R, and the presence of an ACT-like domain (Fig. 1A), results are inconsistent on whether the C-terminal region of GL3 is capable of forming homodimers (35Patra B. Pattanaik S. Yuan L. Ubiquitin protein ligase 3 mediates the proteasomal degradation of GLABROUS 3 and ENHANCER OF GLABROUS 3, regulators of trichome development and flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2013; 74: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Wen J.

Behav. 2018; 13: 1795-1814Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Here, using a combination of yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays with the amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (ALPHA), we demonstrate that similar to R, the ACT-like domain of GL3 can homodimerize, yet with significantly lower affinity. We used structural predictions combined with the limited sequence homology between these ACT-like domains to identify a key residue (Val 568 in R) that, when replaced with the corresponding residue in GL3 (Ser), significantly impairs dimerization strength. Conversely, the replacement of this Ser residue with Val in GL3 is sufficient to enhance dimerization by more than fivefold. The analysis of the distribution of these two residues across plant ACT-like domains showed that GL3 is likely the exception, since most ACT-harboring bHLH factors contain Val or other aliphatic residues at the equivalent 568 position. The evaluation of apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) with ALPHA for the various wildtype and mutant ACT-like domains allowed us to correlate strength of interaction with Y2H assay results, providing insights regarding the meaning of Y2H results as well as a possible explanation for prior inconsistencies (35Patra B. Pattanaik S. Yuan L. Ubiquitin protein ligase 3 mediates the proteasomal degradation of GLABROUS 3 and ENHANCER OF GLABROUS 3, regulators of trichome development and flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2013; 74: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Wen J.

Behav. 2018; 13: 1795-1814Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, our studies provide significant insights regarding the dimerization of ACT-like domains. GL3 has a very similar domain organization as R, including a C-terminal region (residues 552–637) that shows the ββαββα secondary structure that characterizes the R ACT-like domain (RACT, residues 525–610; Fig. 1A). We used the Y2H assay to investigate dimerization of GL3552–637, in conditions in which R525–610 shows robust dimerization (13Feller A. Hernandez J.M. Grotewold E.

Chem. 2006; 281: 28964-28974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For this, we fused GL3552–637 to the GAL4 activation domain (in plasmid pAD–GL3552–637; harboring the LEU2 selectable marker) and to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (in plasmid pBD–GL3552–637; harboring the TRP1 selectable marker). We transformed pAD–GL3552–637 and pBD–GL3552–637 into the PJ69.4 yeast strain (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and assayed growth in synthetically defined (SD) media lacking leucine and tryptophan (–L–T); leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (–L–T–H); and leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine (–L–T–H–A). In contrast to cells harboring pAD–R525–610 and pBD–R525–610, which grew robustly in –L–T–H–A media, no growth in –L–T–H (usually considered adequate for weak interactions) or –L–T–H–A (usually considered adequate for strong interactions) was observed for cells with pAD–GL3552–637 and pBD–GL3552–637 (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with published results (35Patra B. Pattanaik S. Yuan L. Ubiquitin protein ligase 3 mediates the proteasomal degradation of GLABROUS 3 and ENHANCER OF GLABROUS 3, regulators of trichome development and flavonoid biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.Plant J. 2013; 74: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). No growth in –L–T–H or –L–T–H–A media was observed for either R525–610 or GL3552–637 fused to pAD or pBD, in the presence of the corresponding empty plasmids (Fig. S1). The growth of the various yeast strains in selective media as an indication of PPI was complemented by β-galactosidase assays, taking advantage that the PJ69.4 yeast strain harbors the LacZ gene under a GAL4-controlled promoter (37James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomic libraries and a host strain designed for highly efficient two-hybrid selection in yeast.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays confirmed the results obtained in selective media (Fig. S2). We also compared the growth of the various strains shown in Figure S3 in –L–T–H media supplemented with increasing concentrations (10–50 mM) of the HIS3 enzyme inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). The results show almost a perfect correlation between the ability of cells to grow in the presence of 3-AT and the enhanced selection provided by omitting adenine from the media (Fig. S3, compare with Fig. S2). Western blots of extracts of yeast cells expressing several proteins fused to the GAL4–AD and showing distinct interaction strengths in yeast showed similar levels of accumulation when using commercial antibodies to GAL4–AD (Fig. S4). These results indicate that the different strengths of interaction observed in yeast are unlikely a consequence of different stability of the proteins. To compare the dimerization binding affinities of GL3552–637 and R525–610, we expressed and affinity purified each protein fused to glutathione-S-transferase (GST) or the N6His tag (Fig. S5, A–D) and determined the respective Kd values using the ALPHA, by performing competition and saturation binding assays (Fig. 2A). For the competition binding assay, purified untagged (i.e., without N6His or GST tag) versions of R525–610 and GL3552–637 (Fig. S5E) were used as competitors (Fig. 2A and Table 1). In agreement with R525–610 dimerizing very robustly (26Kong Q. Pattanaik S. Feller A. Werkman J.R. Chai C. Wang Y. Grotewold E. Yuan L. Regulatory switch enforced by basic helix-loop-helix and ACT-domain mediated dimerizations of the maize transcription factor R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it showed a Kd of 100 nM (Fig. 2B and Table 1). In contrast, in identical conditions, GL3552–637 dimerization is characterized by a much higher Kd of 1.3 to 1.5 μM (Fig. 2C and Table 1). Based on these results, we conclude that GL3552–637 is capable of forming homodimers, but this interaction is too weak to be detected by Y2H.Table 1Summary of the dimerization strength of the ACT domains of R and GL3 evaluated by saturation binding using ALPHA and Y2H assaysProteinMutationY2HApparent Kd value (μM)aThe Kd values represent the average ± standard deviation of three biological replicates.RWT–L–T–H–A0.10 ± 0.01V568SNo growth1.72 ± 0.20L569H–L–T–H–A0.16 ± 0.03A573SNo growth0.43 ± 0.06V568S/L569HNo growth1.59 ± 0.23V568S/A573SNo growth0.99 ± 0.17L569H/A573S–L–T–H0.11 ± 0.02V568S/L569H/A573SNo growth1.51 ± 0.10GL3WTNo growth1.54 ± 0.12S595V–L–T–H0.26 ± 0.01H596LNo growth1.49 ± 0.24S600ANo growth1.59 ± 0.52S595V/H596L–L–T–H0.27 ± 0.05S595V/S600A–L–T–H0.36 ± 0.04H596L/S600ANo growth2.23 ± 0.33S595V/H596L/S600ANo growth1.77 ± 0.19a The Kd values represent the average ± standard deviation of three biological replicates. Open table in a new tab To identify the residues that are potentially responsible for the different dimerization strengths of RACT and GL3ACT, we took advantage of homology modeling using phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH; Protein Data Bank [PDB]: 5FII) as a template, as it showed the highest secondary structure similarity with RACT and GL3ACT. The RACT and GL3ACT predicted secondary structures showed overall very similar organization, despite having only 33% amino acid identity (Fig. 1A). The homology-modeled monomeric RACT and GL3ACT were then subjected to homodimer predictions using GalaxyHomomer (38Baek M. Park T. Heo L. Park C. Seok C. GalaxyHomomer: A web server for protein homo-oligomer structure prediction from a monomer sequence or structure.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: W320-W324Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and GalaxyRefineComplex (39Heo L. Lee H. Seok C. GalaxyRefineComplex: Refinement of protein-protein complex model structures driven by interface repacking.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 32153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We considered two possible configurations for the respective dimeric forms, side-by-side (Fig. 3) and face-to-face (Fig. S6) arrangements based on what is known on how other ACT domains dimerize (18Grant G.A. The ACT domain: A small molecule binding domain and its role as a common regulatory element.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33825-33829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that substitution mutations of S570A, Q572A, and S574A in RACT abolished its dimerization in Y2H assays (26Kong Q. Pattanaik S. Feller A. Werkman J.R. Chai C. Wang Y. Grotewold E. Yuan L. Regulatory switch enforced by basic helix-loop-helix and ACT-domain mediated dimerizations of the maize transcription factor R.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2012; 109: E2091-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The effect of these mutations, which are located on the β2-strand (Figs. 3 and S6), is more consistent with the side-by-side configuration, as these three amino acids would be right at the dimer interface. Based on this potential configuration for the RACT and GL3ACT dimers, the β2-strand in each is predicted to be important for the interaction. There are three amino acid differences in this region: V568 in RACT corresponding to S595 in GL3ACT, L569 in RACT corresponding to H596 in GL3ACT, and A573 in RACT corresponding to S600 in GL3ACT (Figs. 1A and 3). Significantly, the three amino acids in RACT are hydrophobic, whereas the corresponding ones in GL3ACT are polar. To determine the contribution of each of these three residues to the different dimerization strengths of RACT and GL3ACT, we made the corresponding single, double, and triple amino acid substitutions in each of the two ACT domains and tested their ability to interact in Y2H assays. When we substituted V568 by S in R525–610 (R525–610;V568S), dimerization was completely abolished, reflected in no growth in –L–T–H or –L–T–H–A and very low β-galactosidase activity, compared with the robust dimerization of R525–610 (Fig. 4A, compare #2 and #3; and Fig. S2A). A similar dimerization abatement was observed for the A573S substitution (Fig. 4A, compare #2 and #5; and Fig. S2A). In contrast, the L569H mutation had no effect on the dimerization activity of R525–610, as evidenced by the similar growth and β-galactosidase activity with yeast strain harboring the wildtype versions (Fig. 4A, compare #2 and #4; and Fig. S2A). The double substitutions followed the expected trend, with the V568S/L569H and V568S/A573S showing no R525–610 dimerization (Fig. 4A, #6 and #7; and Fig. S2A). Unexpected was the observation that the yeast strain harboring the L569H/A573S double mutant displayed significantly better interaction than the strain with the single A573S mutant (Fig. 4A, compare #5 and #8; and Fig. S2A). The reciprocal residue changes were incorporated into GL3552–637 and tested for dimerization using the Y2H assay. Compared with GL3552–637, which showed no interaction, yeast cells harboring pAD–GL3552–637;S595V and pAD–GL3552–637;S595V showed growth in –L–T–H, but not in –L–T–H–A (compare #2 and #3 in Fig. 4B), consistent with increased β-galactosidase activity (Fig. S2B), indicating that the S595V substitution is sufficient to confer the ability of GL3 to dimerize to levels that can now be detected in Y2H assays. No significant interaction was observed for any of the other single or multiple mutations, with the exception of S595V/H596L and S595V/S600A, which showed growth in –L–T–H and moderate β-galactosidase activity (Figs. 4B and S2B). While the proposed structural models can accurately predict the effect of the other mutations, it fails to explain the ability of the S595V/H596L and S595V/S600A mutants in GL3 to dimerize. To quantitatively evaluate and compare the interaction strengths of the various R and GL3 ACT mutants, Kd values were determined by saturation binding assays using ALPHA and the respective proteins tagged with GST or N6His (Fig. 2A). The apparent Kd values determined by saturation binding for R525–610 were very similar to those determined by competition binding and corresponded to 100 ± 27 nM (competition binding; Fig. 2B) and 100 ± 10 nM (saturation binding; Table 1, Figs. 5A and S7). Also consistent between both methods, the Kd values for GL3552–637 were 1.28 ± 0.17 μM estimated by the competition assay (Fig. 2C) and 1.54 ± 0.12 μM by the saturation ass"
https://openalex.org/W3159102491,"Species-specific monitoring activities represent fundamental tools for natural resource management and conservation but require techniques that target species-specific traits or markers. Sea lamprey, a destructive invasive species in the Laurentian Great Lakes and conservation target in North America and Europe, is among very few fishes that possess and use oral suction, yet suction has not been exploited for sea lamprey control or conservation. Knowledge of specific characteristics of sea lamprey suction (e.g., amplitude, duration, and pattern of suction events; hereafter ‘suction dynamics’) may be useful to develop devices that detect, record, and respond to the presence of sea lamprey at a given place and time. Previous observations were limited to adult sea lampreys in static water. In this study, pressure sensing panels were constructed and used to measure oral suction pressures and describe suction dynamics of juvenile and adult sea lampreys at multiple locations within the mouth and in static and flowing water. Suction dynamics were largely consistent with previous descriptions, but more variation was observed. For adult sea lampreys, suction pressures ranged from –0.6 kPa to –26 kPa with 20 s to 200 s between pumps at rest, and increased to –8 kPa to –70 kPa when lampreys were manually disengaged. An array of sensors indicated that suction pressure distribution was largely uniform across the mouths of both juvenile and adult lampreys; but some apparent variation was attributed to obstruction of sensing portal holes by teeth. Suction pressure did not differ between static and flowing water when water velocity was lower than 0.45 m/s. Such information may inform design of new systems to monitor behavior, distribution and abundance of lampreys."
https://openalex.org/W3157053393,"While primary productivity in the oligotrophic North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) is changing, the micro-size plankton community has not been evaluated in the last 4 decades, prompting a re-evaluation. We collected samples over three years (2016–2018) from depths of 10 to 200 m ( n = 127), and the micro-size plankton were identified and counted to understand the heterogeneity of micro-size plankton community structure. The assemblages were consistent to the those of 4 decades ago. Dinophyceae (dinoflagellates) were the most numerically abundant, followed by Cryptophyceae and Bacillariophyceae (diatoms). The other micro-size plankton classes (Cyanophyceae, Haptophyceae, Dictyochophyceae, Euglenophyceae, and Prasinophyceae) were not always detected, whereas only Trichodesmium spp. was counted in the Cyanophyceae. Other unidentified autotrophic and heterotrophic flagellates were also significantly present, and their numeric abundance was higher than or at the same level as was that of the Dinophyceae. In the Dinophyceae, Gymnodiniaceae and Peridiniales were abundant. The chlorophyll a concentration and these class-level assemblages suggested micro-size plankton is not a major primary producer in this area. We applied generalized additive models (GAMs) and principal coordination analyses (PCoAs) to evaluate the habitats of every plankton group and the heterogeneity of the assemblages. The GAMs suggested that every classified plankton abundance showed a similar response to salinity, and we observed differences in habitats in terms of temperature and nitrate concentrations. Based on the PCoAs, we observed unique communities at the 200 m depth layer compared with those at the other sampling layers. The site scores of PCoAs indicated that the micro-size plankton assemblages are most heterogeneous at the 10 m depth layer. At such depth, diazotrophic Cyanophyceae ( Trichodesmium spp.) are abundant, particularly in less-saline water. Therefore, nitrogen fixation may contribute to the heterogeneity in the abundance and assemblages in the western NPSG."
https://openalex.org/W3157906995,"miRNAs are important regulators of eukaryotic gene expression. The post-transcriptional maturation of miRNAs is controlled by the Drosha-DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) microprocessor. Dysregulation of miRNA biogenesis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases, including cancers. C-terminal–binding protein–interacting protein (CtIP) is a well-known DNA repair factor that promotes the processing of DNA double-strand break (DSB) to initiate homologous recombination–mediated DSB repair. However, it was unclear whether CtIP has other unknown cellular functions. Here, we aimed to uncover the roles of CtIP in miRNA maturation and cancer cell metastasis. We found that CtIP is a potential regulatory factor that suppresses the processing of miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). CtIP directly bound to both DGCR8 and pri-miRNAs through a conserved Sae2-like domain, reduced the binding of Drosha to DGCR8 and pri-miRNA substrate, and inhibited processing activity of Drosha complex. CtIP depletion significantly increased the expression levels of a subset of mature miRNAs, including miR-302 family members that are associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancer types. We also found that CtIP-inhibited miRNAs, such as miR-302 family members, are not crucial for DSB repair. However, increase of miR-302b levels or loss of CtIP function severely suppressed human colon cancer cell line tumor cell metastasis in a mouse xenograft model.

These studies reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of CtIP in miRNA processing and tumor metastasis that represents a new function of CtIP in cancer. miRNAs are a major class of short noncoding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression by repressing the translation and/or promoting the degradation of target messenger RNAs (1Ghildiyal M. Zamore P.D. Small silencing RNAs: An expanding universe.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 2Bartel D.P.

Gene silencing by microRNAs: Contributions of translational repression and mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2011; 12: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). MiRNAs are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Generally, miRNAs are encoded as individual genes or within clusters comprising several different miRNAs. The biogenesis of miRNAs starts through the transcription of miRNA genes by RNA polymerase II, which produces miRNA primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) containing a stem–loop hairpin structure (4Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Biogenesis of small RNAs in animals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 5Lee Y. Kim M. Han J. Yeom K.H. Lee S. Baek S.H. Kim V.N. MicroRNA genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4051-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, pri-miRNAs are cleaved by the microprocessor complex containing the ribonuclease (RNase) III enzyme Drosha and its cofactor DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8) into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) with 70 to 100 nucleotide-long hairpin structures (6Gregory R.I. Yan K.P. Amuthan G. Chendrimada T. Doratotaj B. Cooch N. Shiekhattar R.

The pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5, where they are further processed into mature miRNAs by cytoplasmic Dicer RNase III to yield an approximately 22-nucleotide miRNA duplex (8Yi R. Qin Y. Macara I.G. Cullen B.R. Exportin-5 mediates the nuclear export of pre-microRNAs and short hairpin RNAs.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 3011-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (2058) Google Scholar, 9Lund E.

Dicer functions in RNA interference and in synthesis of small RNA involved in developmental timing in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2654-2659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). One strand of the miRNA duplex is subsequently incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing complex. Base pairing between the miRNA and target mRNA transcripts at their 3′ UTRs guides the RNA-induced silencing complex to induce the mRNA degradation or translation inhibition (12Khvorova A.

The production and maturation of miRNA must be strictly regulated, as any disruption of the control mechanisms may lead to the development of various kinds of diseases, including cancer. As noted previously, miRNA expression involves the transcription of miRNA genes and the maturation of primary transcripts. Thus, miRNA levels may be regulated in both a transcription-dependent and transcription-independent manner. However, in many cases, the levels of mature miRNAs are determined by post-transcriptional maturation rather than transcriptional regulation. The level of expression and activity of core components of the miRNA biogenesis machinery are often found to be dysregulated in cancer. For instance, the expression levels of Drosha and Dicer are either increased or decreased in various types of cancers, and they are inversely correlated with advanced tumor stages and poor clinical outcomes (14Hata A. Kashima R. Dysregulation of microRNA biogenesis machinery in cancer.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2016; 51: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Somatic and germline mutations of Drosha or DGCR8 have also been frequently found in some cancers (15Davalos V. Esteller M. MicroRNAs and cancer epigenetics: A macrorevolution.Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2010; 22: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 16Merritt W.M. Lin Y.G. Han L.Y. Kamat A.A. Spannuth W.A. Schmandt R. Urbauer D. Pennacchio L.A. Cheng J.F. Nick A.M. Deavers M.T.

In particular, the activity of the Drosha microprocessor is modulated by different nuclear proteins in a manner that usually affects the processing of only a small subset of miRNAs. For example, the RNA-editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 interacts with DGCR8 and suppresses microprocessor activity by reducing the availability of DGCR8 to Drosha. The expression of a proportion of miRNAs was upregulated in adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1-defective cancer cells, which may have facilitated the malignant activity of metastatic melanoma (17Nemlich Y.

Smad proteins, the signal transducers of transforming growth factor-β, also modulate Drosha activity in the nucleus. Smads are recruited to the Drosha complex by DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) and promote the pri-miRNA processing of about 20 miRNAs. Among them, miR-21 promotes the metastatic and invasive potential of cancer cells through the inhibition of a large group of tumor suppressor genes (18Davis B.N. Hilyard A.C. Lagna G. Hata A.

In addition, the central tumor suppressor p53 and several RNA-binding proteins, including KH-type splicing regulatory protein, TAR DNA-binding protein-43, DEAD-box 1, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, and breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), have also been identified as regulatory proteins that interact with Drosha complexes and modulate the maturation of specific miRNAs (20Guil S.

Together with the meiotic recombination 11 (MRE11)–ATP-binding cassette—ATPase (RAD50)–Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1) (MRN) complex, CtIP efficiently promotes end resection, which generates 3′-end ssDNA filaments to promote homologous recombination (HR)–mediated DSB repair (27Sartori A.A.

The middle part of CtIP is important for its endonuclease activity and interactions with multiple proteins, including BRCA1, CtBP transcriptional repressor, retinoblastoma-associated protein, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Phosphorylations at multiple sites of this region facilitate the capacity of CtIP to promote MRN- and DNA2-mediated DSB end resection and end resection–dependent DSB repair (37Wang H. Shi L.Z.

However, the mechanisms by which conserved Sae2-like domains contribute to the function of CtIP are still largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functions of CtIP in miRNA post-transcription processing, its association with the Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor, and its effects in cancer cells. Using immunoprecipitation experiments, we assessed the associations CtIP with Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor complex proteins and pri-miRNA. We then investigated the effects of knocking out the CtIP gene on colorectal cancer cell miRNA expression and metastasis as well as osteosarcoma cell DSB end processing and repair. We found that CtIP is involved in Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor–mediated pri-miRNA processing through its Sae2-like domain. This domain was shown to directly interact with DGCR8 and pri-miRNAs and suppress the Drosha complex processing of a subset of pri-miRNA substrates, including miR-302 family members. The depletion of CtIP or overexpression of miR-302b strongly inhibited the metastasis of human colon cancer cell line (HCT116) colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. The findings suggest that the classical DSB repair factor CtIP promotes the metastatic capacity of tumor cells through the regulation of miRNA maturation. In order to explore the CtIP-associated proteins that specifically interact with its C-terminal conserved Sae2-like domain, high-purity CtIP-C (Sae2-like domain) protein (Fig. 1A) was obtained and coupled with cyanogen bromide–activated Sepharose 4B, and CtIP-C affinity purification was performed using 293T cell lysate. CtIP-C–associated proteins were then subjected to mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 1A). We found several known CtIP-associated proteins, including DNA2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, 3'-5' exonuclease domain-containing protein 2, and CtBP. Surprisingly, several Drosha-DGCR8 microprocessor components, such as DDX5, DEAD-box 1, and KH-type splicing regulatory protein, also were copurified (Fig. 1A). To confirm the association of CtIP with the DGCR8 microprocessor, we performed a regular glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay using GST-CtIP-C fusion protein as bait. We again found that CtIP-C interacts with the DSB repair factors Nbs1 and Rad50 and the microprocessor components DGCR8 and DDX5 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments to confirm the interactions and found that endogenous Drosha and DGCR8 were present in the CtIP immunocomplex (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that CtIP is a new Drosha-DGCR8–associated protein, and CtIP may have a role in miRNA biogenesis. To determine the effect of CtIP on cancer miRNA biogenesis, we analyzed the miRNA expression profiles in wildtype HCT116 and CtIP-deficient HCT116 cells (CtIP-KO) using a human cancer miRNA quantitative PCR (qPCR) array. The depletion of CtIP in HCT116 cells significantly increased the expression of a subset of 49 miRNAs (cutoff greater than 3-fold; Fig. 2A), which suggests CtIP inhibited the expression of these miRNAs. We prioritized the miRNAs with the most significant changes and performed a regular qPCR assay to confirm the effects of CtIP on these selected miRNAs. Levels of mature miRNAs, including three miR-302 members (miR-302b, miR-302a, and miR-302d) and miR-135a, were upregulated in CtIP-KO cells (Fig. 2B). A similar effect was observed when CtIP expression was suppressed by shRNAs in HCT116 cells (Fig. 2C) and other common tumor cell lines, including Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (Fig. 2D) and human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS) (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, CtIP depletion did not alter the primary transcripts of selected miRNAs (Fig. 2F), suggesting that CtIP regulated the expression of specific miRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. As mentioned earlier, after transcription, the pri-miRNAs are processed by nuclear Drosha-DGCR8 and cytoplasmic DICER1. CtIP is only functional in cell nucleus (Fig. S1A). The expression level of DICER1 is not changed in CtIP-KO cells (Fig. S1B). CtIP may not directly or indirectly regulate maturation of miRNA through DICER1. In addition, pre-miR302b level was also upregulated in CtIP-KO cells (Fig. S1C). We thus thought that CtIP should suppress the levels of specific mature miRNAs through modulation of nucleus processing of these miRNAs. To understand how CtIP regulates miRNA processing, we performed GST pull-down assays using purified full-length CtIP from insect cells to examine the interactions between CtIP and components of the nuclear miRNA-processing complex. We found there was a direct interaction between CtIP and DGCR8 (Figs. 3A and S2). The interaction between CtIP and DGCR8 was then characterized. The central region (200–460 and 460–600 fragments) and the C-terminal 770 to 897 fragment (the Sae2-like domain) of CtIP were shown to interact with DGCR8 (Figs. 3B and S2). DGCR8 contains a nuclear localization signal at the N-terminal region, a central RNA-binding heme domain (Rhed), two double-stranded RNA-binding domains, and a C-terminal tail (42Shiohama A.

Using purified proteins, we found that the GST-fused Rhed domain alone (GST-DG-Rhed) and the nuclear localization signal deletion mutant (GST-DG-△N) bound to CtIP (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the Rhed domain, but not other domains on DGCR8, is important in the interaction between DGCR8 and CtIP. We next used a bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) reporter to examine the potential interaction of CtIP and DGCR8 in living cells. This reporter relies on protein interactions bringing together ectopically expressed Venus N-terminal (VN-) and Venus C-terminal (VC-) fragments of fluorescent protein reconstitute fluorescence of YFP protein, thus allowing direct visualization of protein interactions in their normal cellular environment. As expected, cotransfection of 293T cells with either of VN-vector and DGCR8-VC or CtIP-VN and VC-vector constructs generated no fluorescence signal. However, cotransfection of 293T cells with CtIP-VN and DGCR8-VC resulted in obvious fluorescence (Fig. 3D), suggesting a direct interaction between CtIP and DGCR8 in cells. To further confirm this finding, we performed proximity ligation assays (in situ PLAs) using antibodies directed against CtIP and DGCR8. As shown in Figure 3E, PLA foci could be readily detected in the nucleus when both CtIP and DGCR8 antibody were used. The PLA signals were not observed in the absence of one primary antibody. These results suggest that CtIP directly interacts with DGCR8 both in vitro and in the cells. In our previous study, we found that CtIP binds to the hairpin DNA substrate (30Wang H. Li Y. Truong L.N. Shi L.Z. Hwang P.Y. He J. Do J. Cho M.J. Li H. Negrete A. Shiloach J. Berns M.W. Shen B. Chen L. Wu X.

Cell. 2014; 54: 1012-1021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We thus speculated that CtIP also engages with pri-miRNA, which contains a similar secondary structure with a hairpin DNA substrate. As revealed by RNA chromatin immunoprecipitation (RNA-ChIP), overexpressed CtIP was associated with pri-miR302 transcripts in vivo (Fig. 4A). We further performed an RNA pull-down assay using a purified GST-CtIP fusion protein as bait to test whether CtIP directly interacts with pri-miRNA in vitro. We found that the in vitro–transcribed pri-miR302b was efficiently pulled down by purified GST-CtIP (full-length) in comparison with GST protein alone (Fig. 4B). These data indicate the direct binding of CtIP to pri-miR302. We next performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) assay using Escherichia coli–produced CtIP fragments to map the determinants of the interaction. Intriguingly, pri-miR302 efficiently bound to a region of CtIP 770 to 897, highlighting the importance of the conserved Sae2-like domain of CtIP for pri-miRNA binding. We further confirmed the interaction between CtIP and pri-miR302 using a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay, which can quantitatively define the interaction between two molecules. Consistent with the RNA pull-down and EMSA data, both GFP-tagged CtIP (GFP-CtIP) with pri-miR302b (Fig. 4D) and Cyp-labeled pri-miR302b with CtIP-C protein (Fig. 4E) exhibited obvious interactions in vitro. The CtIP-C protein yielded a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.39 μM, which is comparable to the Kd value obtained for full-length CtIP (GFP-CtIP, 3.94 μM). These data support the notion that the conserved Sae2-like domain of CtIP is a secondary structure containing RNA interactor that mediates the interaction between CtIP and pri-miRNA. The direct interaction of CtIP with DGCR8 and pri-miRNA substrates suggests that CtIP may interfere with the binding of DGCR8 or pri-miRNA substrate to Drosha, which is the core RNase III enzyme in the microprocessor. We compared the capacity of Drosha to bind to DGCR8 and pri-miR302 in the presence or absence of CtIP. Consistent with previous reports, we found that endogenous Drosha or overexpressed GFP-Drosha interacted with DGCR8 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, when CtIP was knocked out, the interactions increased (Fig. 5, A and B), suggesting that endogenous CtIP hinders the interaction between Drosha and its cofactors. In line with these results, ectopic expression of Flag-CtIP reduced the YFP fluorescent intensity reconstituted by cotransfection of Drosha-VN and DGCR8-VC in 293T cells (Fig. 5C). These data support a notion that CtIP may interfere with the binding of Drosha to DGCR8. Next, we performed RNA-ChIP using Flag-Drosha to analyze the relationship between Drosha and RNA substrates. The data indicated that CtIP depletion obviously increased the association between Drosha and pri-miR302 (Fig. 5D). The attenuated binding of Drosha to a substrate might suppress its enzyme activity. Therefore, we used an in vitro pri-miRNA processing assay to assess the effect of CtIP on Drosha activity. Clearly, purified GST-CtIP but not GST alone efficiently inhibited the processing activity of Drosha on pri-miR302b (Fig. 5E). Taken together, our data suggest that CtIP reduces the binding of Drosha to its cofactor DGCR8 and pri-miRNA"

This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire that can assess an individual’s perceived risk of developing four major NCDs. We used the exploratory sequential mixed methods design. The qualitative part developed a questionnaire by two rounds of Delphi expert panels. The quantitative part validated the questionnaire using both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We used separate samples for EFA (n = 150) and CFA (n = 210). The participants were aged between 25–60 years of both sexes with no known history of NCDs, and face-to-face interviews were conducted. First, we generated an 86-item questionnaire based on the health belief model. Two expert panels ensured the questionnaire’s content validity. The experts removed the overlapped items and items that did not represent the specific construct and developed a 51-item questionnaire. Next, we validated the questionnaire. We conducted a parallel analysis to determine the number of factors to be extracted. EFA constituted a five-factor model with 22 high loading items, which extracted 54% of the variance. We run four CFA models (single factor, five-factor, bifactor, and hierarchical) and tested the hypothesized five-factor model. It was found that the 21-item questionnaire (removed one efficacy item due to low loading) was satisfied with good psychometric properties and fitted with observed data in the bifactor model (RMSEA = 0.051, CFI = 0.954, TLI = 0.938, SRMR = 0.054). Hence, an individual’s perceived risk of getting NCDs was constituted with a general perceived risk construct and five specific constructs (perceived susceptibility, perceived barrier, perceived benefit, perceived self-efficacy, and perceived behavioral change intention). It can be measured using the developed questionnaire (NCD-PR5-21). Further research is warranted to assess the questionnaire’s utility in a mismatch between risk perception and current risk; and individualized counseling for behavioral change communication."
https://openalex.org/W3157338038,"We created a novel social feedback paradigm to study how motivation for potential social links is influenced in adolescents and adults. 88 participants (42F/46M) created online posts and then expended physical effort to show their posts to other users, who varied in number of followers and probability of positive feedback. We focused on two populations of particular interest from a social feedback perspective: adolescents relative to young adults (13–17 vs 18–24 years of age), and participants with social anxiety symptoms. Individuals with higher self-reported symptoms of social anxiety did not follow the typical pattern of increased effort to obtain social feedback from high status peers. Adolescents were more willing to exert physical effort on the task than young adults. Overall, participants were more likely to exert physical effort for high social status users and for users likely to yield positive feedback, and men were more likely to exert effort than women, findings that parallel prior results in effort-based tasks with financial rather than social rewards. Together the findings suggest social motivation is malleable, driven by factors of social status and the likelihood of a positive social outcome, and that age, sex, and social anxiety significantly impact patterns of socially motivated decision-making."

https://openalex.org/W3157934708,"Lower elevations are generally thought to contain a greater abundance and diversity of insect communities and their natural enemies than higher elevations. It is less clear, however, how changes in seasons influence this pattern. We conducted a 2-year study (2013‒2014) in guava orchards located in a tropical Andean forest of Peru to investigate differences in fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) and their parasitoid communities at two elevations and over two seasons. Fruit fly traps were installed, monitored, and guava fruits were sampled from eight orchards at low (800–950 m above sea level) and high (1,700–1,900 m above sea level) elevations and during the dry and rainy seasons. At each orchard, adult fruit fly trap captures and emergence of fruit flies and their parasitoids from guava fruit were quantified to determine their abundance and species composition. There was a greater abundance and species richness of fruit flies captured in traps at lower elevations, as well as higher abundance and species evenness of fruit flies that emerged from fruit, indicating that lower elevations are associated with larger fruit fly populations. The abundance, species richness and diversity of parasitoids were also greater at lower elevations. Consequently, guava fruit infestation and fruit fly parasitism rates were also greater at lower elevations. Seasonality also influenced fruit fly populations with a greater number of flies emerging from guava fruit and more fruit infested in the rainy season. However, seasonality had no effect on parasitoid population parameters or rate of parasitism, nor did it interact with elevation as an influence of populations of fruit flies or their parasitoids in guava orchards. This study highlights the importance of examining both elevation and seasonality for a better understanding of the population dynamics of fruit flies and their parasitoids in tropical agroecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W3158210725,"Background As blood transfusion remains life-saving and is being frequently prescribed, a greater number of its practice is unnecessary or inappropriate. This important clinical intervention is reported as one of the five overused medical treatments, with gross over-ordering and whole blood transfusions as the sole component being common in developing countries. Study of recipient’s demographics, clinical conditions, appropriate blood utilization, and continuous clinical audits for quality assurance and service improvement plan are important factors to this practice. This study was designed to assess the recipient’s characteristics, blood type distributions, appropriateness of blood transfusion, and utilization practice of the big medical center. Methods Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 1 to June 30, 2018. Data were collected using a structured data collection format prepared for this study. All transfusion prescriptions were followed from requisition up to completion. Patient’s age, sex, requesting departments, hemodynamics, number and component of units requested and issued, and units transfused were collected. Transfusion appropriateness was assessed by a criterion-based method while blood utilization was calculated. Results A total of 545 units of blood for 425 patients were cross-matched of the 809 units of total blood prescribed. The mean and median age of transfused individuals was found to be 27.47 ±15.28 years and 26 years respectively, and 65.4% females most in reproductive age groups. O and A Rhesus-positive blood types were the two major blood groups observed. Overall 82.1% of transfusions were appropriate; while only 27.8% of patients received appropriate components as 96.5% of individuals received a whole blood transfusion. Significant blood utilization was recorded with a C/T ratio of 1.05, TP% of 100%, and TI of 1.23. Conclusion Much of the transfusion recipients were relatively young aged and females, most in the reproductive age group. Although whole blood was used as a sole component, significant blood transfusion utilization and appropriateness were recorded; while appropriate component transfusion was recorded to be significantly low. Local transfusion guidelines and appropriate component preparation and utilization are required to improve the sub-optimal blood component transfusion practice."
https://openalex.org/W3159086888,"Xerostomia, known as dry mouth, is caused by decreased salivary flow. Treatment with lubricating oral rinses provides temporary relief of dry mouth discomfort; however, it remains unclear how their composition affects mineralized dental tissues. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of common components in xerostomia oral rinses on biomimetic apatite with varying carbonate contents. Carbonated apatite was synthesized and exposed to one of the following solutions for 72 hours at varying pHs: water-based, phosphorus-containing (PBS), mucin-like containing (MLC), or fluoride-containing (FC) solutions. Post-exposure results indicated that apatite mass decreased irrespective of pH and solution composition, while solution buffering was pH dependent. Raman and X-ray diffraction analysis showed that the addition of phosphorus, mucin-like molecules, and fluoride in solution decreases mineral carbonate levels and changed the lattice spacing and crystallinity of bioapatite, indicative of dissolution/recrystallization processes. The mineral recrystallized into a less-carbonated apatite in the PBS and MLC solutions, and into fluorapatite in FC. Tap water did not affect the apatite lattice structure suggesting formation of a labile carbonate surface layer on apatite. These results reveal that solution composition can have varied and complex effects on dental mineral beyond dissolution, which can have long term consequences on mineral solubility and mechanics. Therefore, clinicians should consider these factors when advising treatments for xerostomia patients."
https://openalex.org/W3159273858,"We define a new family of similarity and distance measures on graphs, and explore their theoretical properties in comparison to conventional distance metrics. These measures are defined by the solution(s) to an optimization problem which attempts find a map minimizing the discrepancy between two graph Laplacian exponential matrices, under norm-preserving and sparsity constraints. Variants of the distance metric are introduced to consider such optimized maps under sparsity constraints as well as fixed time-scaling between the two Laplacians. The objective function of this optimization is multimodal and has discontinuous slope, and is hence difficult for univariate optimizers to solve. We demonstrate a novel procedure for efficiently calculating these optima for two of our distance measure variants. We present numerical experiments demonstrating that (a) upper bounds of our distance metrics can be used to distinguish between lineages of related graphs; (b) our procedure is faster at finding the required optima, by as much as a factor of 10 3 ; and (c) the upper bounds satisfy the triangle inequality exactly under some assumptions and approximately under others. We also derive an upper bound for the distance between two graph products, in terms of the distance between the two pairs of factors. Additionally, we present several possible applications, including the construction of infinite “graph limits” by means of Cauchy sequences of graphs related to one another by our distance measure."
https://openalex.org/W3159303921,"The variability of a child’s voice onset time (VOT) decreases during development as they learn to coordinate upper vocal tract and laryngeal articulatory gestures. Yet, little is known about the relationship between VOT and other early motor tasks. The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between infant vocalization and another early oromotor task, non-nutritive suck (NNS). Twenty-five full-term infants (11 male, 14 female) completed this study. NNS was measured with a customized pacifier at 3 months to evaluate this early reflex. Measures of mean VOT and variability of VOT (measured via coefficient of variation) were collected from 12-month-old infants using a Language Environmental Analysis device. Variability of VOTs at 12 months was significantly related to NNS measures at 3-months. Increased VOT variability was primarily driven by increased NNS intraburst frequency and increased NNS burst duration. There were no relationships between average VOT or range of VOT and NNS measures. Findings from this pilot study indicate a relationship between NNS measures of intraburst frequency and burst duration and VOT variability. Infants with increased NNS intraburst frequency and NNS burst duration had increased VOT variability, suggesting a relationship between the development of VOT and NNS in the first year of life. Future work is needed to continue to examine the relationship between these early oromotor actions and to evaluate how this may impact later speech development."
https://openalex.org/W3081054235,"The Sandhills of Nebraska is a complex ecosystem, covering 50,000 km 2 in central and western Nebraska and predominantly of virgin grassland. Grasslands are the most widespread vegetation in the U.S. and once dominated regions are currently cultivated croplands, so it stands to reason that some of the current plant pathogens of cultivated crops originated from grasslands, particularly soilborne plant pathogens. The anamorphic genus Rhizoctonia includes genetically diverse organisms that are known to be necrotrophic fungal pathogens, saprophytes, mycorrhiza of orchids, and biocontrol agents. This study aimed to evaluate the diversity of Rhizoctonia spp. on four native grasses in the Sandhills of Nebraska and determine pathogenicity to native grasses and soybean. In 2016 and 2017, a total of 84 samples were collected from 11 sites in the Sandhills, located in eight counties of Nebraska. The samples included soil and symptomatic roots from the four dominant native grasses: sand bluestem, little bluestem, prairie sandreed, and needle-and-thread. Obtained were 17 Rhizoctonia -like isolates identified, including five isolates of binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-F; two isolates each from binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-B, AG-C, and AG-K, Rhizoctonia solani AGs: AG-3, and AG-4; one isolate of binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-L, and one isolate of R . zeae . Disease severity was assessed for representative isolates of each AG in a greenhouse assay using sand bluestem, needle-and-thread, and soybean; prairie sandreed and little bluestem were unable to germinate under artificial conditions. On native grasses, all but two isolates were either mildly aggressive (causing 5–21% disease severity) or aggressive (21–35% disease severity). Among those, three isolates were cross-pathogenic on soybean, with R . solani AG-4 shown to be highly aggressive (86% disease severity). Thus, it is presumed that Rhizoctonia spp. are native to the sandhills grasslands and an emerging pathogen of crops cultivated may have survived in the soil and originate from grasslands."
https://openalex.org/W3159311089,"Predicting survival of patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) is notoriously difficult. A robust prognostic marker can guide clinical decision making. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in blood has been shown to predict survival in many cancers. Pleural fluid bathes the malignant pleural tissues, thus the NLR of the pleural fluid may reflect more closely the local tumour environment. The objective of this study was to explore the prognostic significance of pleural effusion NLR for MPE. We analysed matched effusion and blood from 117 patients with malignant and 24 with benign pleural effusions. Those who had received recent chemotherapy or had a pleurodesis were excluded. Neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in effusions were performed by manual review of cytospin cell preparations by trained observers. Clinical data were extracted from a state-wide hospital database. We found significantly fewer neutrophils (expressed as percentage of total leukocyte count) in pleural fluid than in corresponding blood (9% vs 73%; p&lt;0.001). The NLR was an order of magnitude lower in pleural fluid than in corresponding blood: median [IQR] = 0.20 [0.04–1.18] vs 4.9 [3.0–8.3], p&lt;0.001. Correlation between blood and pleural fluid NLR in MPE patients was moderate (r s = 0.321, p&lt;0.001). In univariate analysis, NLR (&gt;0.745)) in malignant pleural fluid was predictive of poorer survival (HR = 1.698 [1.0054–2.736]; p = 0.030), and remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, presence of a chest drain, cancer type, concurrent infection and subsequent treatment with chemotherapy (HR = 1.786 [1.089–2.928]; p = 0.022). Patients with pleural fluid NLR &gt; 0.745 had a significantly shorter median survival of 130 (95% CI 0–282) days compared to 312 (95% CI 195–428) days for pleural NLR &lt; 0.745, p = 0.026. The NLR in blood was also predictive of poorer survival in MPE patients (HR = 1.959 [1.019–3.096]; p&lt;0.001). The proportion of neutrophils in pleural fluid was predictive of prognosis more strongly than lymphocytes. This study provides evidence that NLR in malignant effusions can predict survival, and therefore may provide prognostic information for this cohort. This prognostic association in the fluid is driven by the presence of neutrophils."
https://openalex.org/W3157419320,"Given the importance of using the vitamin-mineral supplements to guarantee the minimum nutritional recommendations for pets in homemade foods, and hypothesizing that these products may contribute to toxic metals contamination, the present study aimed to determine the concentrations of essential minerals and toxic metals in vitamin-mineral supplements available in the Brazilian market and calculate if the amount recommended by the manufacturer guarantees the minimum recommendations of NRC (2006) and FEDIAF (2020), as well as calculating the amount of toxic metals that animals would consume, according to the amounts recommended by the manufacturer. Seven vitamin-mineral supplements were analyzed. The determination of essential minerals and toxic metals was performed using ICP-OES. Comparisons were made with the minimum recommendations for essential minerals, and with the maximum tolerated levels of toxic metals established by the FDA (2011), descriptively. Most of the vitamin-mineral supplements, in the quantities recommended by the manufacturers, do not guarantee the minimum recommendations of NCR (2006) and FEDIAF (2020) for the following elements: calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, phosphorus, selenium, and zinc. Only one supplement had detectable selenium concentrations. Three supplements provided more than 0.02mg of mercury/kg of body weight, the safe upper limit used to establish the maximum tolerated level of this element. It is concluded that most vitamin-mineral supplements do not meet the minimum recommendations for most essential minerals and, if formulated by untrained professionals, even with supplementation, homemade foods may still be nutritionally deficient. Furthermore, some vitamin-mineral supplements analyzed may imply risks of mercury poisoning in pets."
https://openalex.org/W3157596236,"Signaling at nerve cell synapses is a key determinant of proper brain function, and synaptic defects—or synaptopathies—are at the basis of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Collybistin (CB), a brain-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor, is essential for the formation of γ-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) postsynapses in defined regions of the mammalian forebrain, including the hippocampus and basolateral amygdala. This process depends on a direct interaction of CB with the scaffolding protein gephyrin, which leads to the redistribution of gephyrin into submembranous clusters at nascent inhibitory synapses. Strikingly, synaptic clustering of gephyrin and GABAA type A receptors (GABAARs) in several brain regions, including the cerebral cortex and certain thalamic areas, is unperturbed in CB-deficient mice, indicating that the formation of a substantial subset of inhibitory postsynapses must be controlled by gephyrin-interacting proteins other than CB. Previous studies indicated that the α3 subunit of GABAARs (GABAAR-α3) binds directly and with high affinity to gephyrin. Here, we provide evidence (i) that a homooligomeric GABAAR-α3A343W mutant induces the formation of submembranous gephyrin clusters independently of CB in COS-7 cells, (ii) that gephyrin clustering is unaltered in the neuronal subpopulations endogenously expressing the GABAAR-α3 in CB-deficient brains, and (iii) that exogenous expression of GABAAR-α3 partially rescues impaired gephyrin clustering in CB-deficient hippocampal neurons. Our results identify an important role of GABAAR-α3 in promoting gephyrin-mediated and CB-independent formation of inhibitory postsynapses."
https://openalex.org/W3157920109,"Biomedical use of radiation is utilized in effective diagnostic and treatment tools, yet can introduce risks to healthy tissues. High energy photons used for diagnostic purposes have high penetration depth and can discriminate multiple tissues based on attenuation properties of different materials. Likewise, the ability to deposit energy at various targets within tumors make the use of photons effective treatment for cancer. Radiation focused on a tumor will deposit energy when it interacts with a biological structure (e.g. DNA), which will result in cell kill should repair capacity of the tissue be overwhelmed. Likewise, damage to normal, non-cancerous tissues is a consequence of radiation that can lead to acute or late, chronic toxicity profiles. Adipose derived stem cells (ADSCs) are mesenchymal stem cells that have been proven to have similar characteristics to bone marrow derived stem cells, except that they are much easier to obtain. Within the body, ADSCs act as immunomodulators and assist with the maintenance and repair of tissues. They have been shown to have excellent differentiation capability, making them an extremely viable option for stem cell therapies and regenerative medicine applications. Due to the tissue ADSCs are derived from, they are highly likely to be affected by radiation therapy, especially when treating tumors localized to structures with relatively high ADSC content (eg., breast cancer). For this reason, the purpose behind this research is to better understand how ADSCs are affected by doses of radiation comparable to a single fraction of radiation therapy. We also measured the response of ADSCs to exposure at different dose rates to determine if there is a significant difference in the response of ADSCs to radiation therapy relevant doses of ionizing radiation. Our findings indicate that ADSCs exposed to Cesium (Cs 137)-gamma rays at a moderate dose of 2Gy and either a low dose rate (1.40Gy/min) or a high dose rate (7.31Gy/min) slow proliferation rate, and with cell cycle arrest in some populations. These responses ADSCs were not as marked as previously measured in other stem cell types. In addition, our results indicate that differences in dose rate in the Gy/min range typically utilized in small animal or cell irradiation platforms have a minimal effect on the function of ADSCs. The potential ADSCs have in the space of regenerative medicine makes them an ideal candidate for study with ionizing radiation, as they are one of the main cell types to promote tissue healing."
https://openalex.org/W3159077399,"It is widely held in socio-behavioral studies of suicide that higher levels of stress and lower levels of economic status amplify suicidal vulnerability when confronted with a proximal stressor, reflecting the traditionally prevalent understanding in health psychology and sociology that associates adverse life circumstances with undesirable mental health outcomes. However, upon reflection, there are strong theoretical reasons to doubt that having more stress or being in a more stressful environment always increases suicidal vulnerability given the occurrence of a crisis. Using large nationally representative public survey data on South Korean adolescents, I show that the association between recent psychosocial crisis and suicidal ideation often gets stronger with more favorable levels of perceived stress and improving levels of family economic status. Overall, the increase in the probability of suicidal ideation from recent exposure to a psychosocial crisis is consistently the smallest around medium levels of stress or family economic status and larger at low or high levels. A supplementary exercise suggests that the identified moderation effects operate mainly in virtue of individual-level stress or family economic status in the relative absence of contextual influences at the school level. The findings present preliminary evidence of the stress inoculation hypothesis with regard to suicidal ideation. Research on suicidal vulnerability could benefit from increased attentiveness to the mechanisms through which being in an adverse or unfavorable life situation could protect against the suicide-inducing effects of proximal stressors."
https://openalex.org/W3159400919,"Snake venom thrombin-like enzymes (SVTLEs) are serine proteinases that clot fibrinogen. SVTLEs are distributed mainly in venoms from snakes of the Viperidae family, comprising venomous pit viper snakes. Bothrops snakes are distributed throughout Central and South American and are responsible for most venomous snakebites. Most Bothrops snakes display thrombin-like activity in their venoms, but it has been shown that some species do not present it. In this work, to understand SVTLE polymorphism in Bothrop s snake venoms, we studied individual samples from two species of medical importance in Brazil: Bothrops jararaca , distributed in Southeastern Brazil, which displays coagulant activity on plasma and fibrinogen, and Bothrops erythromelas , found in Northeastern Brazil, which lacks direct fibrinogen coagulant activity but shows plasma coagulant activity. We tested the coagulant activity of venoms and the presence of SVTLE genes by a PCR approach. The SVTLE gene structure in B . jararaca is similar to the Bothrops atrox snake, comprising five exons. We could not amplify SVTLE sequences from B . erythromelas DNA, except for a partial pseudogene. These genes underwent a positive selection in some sites, leading to an amino acid sequence diversification, mostly in exon 2. The phylogenetic tree constructed using SVTLE coding sequences confirms that they are related to the chymotrypsin/kallikrein family. Interestingly, we found a B . jararaca specimen whose venom lacked thrombin-like activity, and its gene sequence was a pseudogene with SVTLE structure, presenting nonsense and frameshift mutations. Our results indicate an association of the lack of thrombin-like activity in B . jararaca and B . erythromelas venoms with mutations and deletions of snake venom thrombin-like enzyme genes."
https://openalex.org/W3152867511,"Highly conserved amino acids are generally anticipated to have similar functions across a protein superfamily, including that of the P2X ion channels, which are gated by extracellular ATP. However, whether and how these functions are conserved becomes less clear when neighboring amino acids are not conserved. Here, we investigate one such case, focused on the highly conserved residue from P2X4, E118 (rat P2X4 numbering, rP2X4), a P2X subtype associated with human neuropathic pain. When we compared the crystal structures of P2X4 with those of other P2X subtypes, including P2X3, P2X7, and AmP2X, we observed a slightly altered side-chain orientation of E118. We used protein chimeras, double-mutant cycle analysis, and molecular modeling to reveal that E118 forms specific contacts with amino acids in the region, which facilitates ATP binding to rP2X4. These contacts are not present in other subtypes because of sequence variance in the beak region, resulting in decoupling of this conserved residue from ATP recognition and/or channel gating of P2X receptors. Our study provides an example of a conserved residue with a specific role in functional proteins enabled by adjacent nonconserved residues. The unique role established by the E118-beak region contact provides a blueprint for the development of subtype-specific inhibitors of P2X4."
https://openalex.org/W3159295136,"Background In Pakistan, there is a dearth of literature on the perceptions of anemia among women of reproductive age (WRA). This study was undertaken to explore the perceptions of women, their husbands, and healthcare providers about anemia, its possible causes, and how anemia impacts maternal and child health in Thatta, Pakistan. Methods A qualitative study was conducted in Thatta, Pakistan from September to December 2018. Using a pre-tested semi-structured interview (SSI), we collected data to understand their definitions of anemia through ten focus group discussions (FGDs) with women and their partners and ten primary informant interviews (KIIs) with healthcare providers. We identified six major themes: (I) Knowledge and awareness of anemia, (II) Causes and consequences of Anemia, (III) Dietary practices, (IV) Knowledge and practices regarding the use of iron-folic acid supplements, (V) Factors influencing prevention and control of anemia and (VI) Women’s health behavior. We analyzed the data through thematic analysis using NVivo 10 software. Results Most community members were not aware of the term anemia but described anemia as a condition characterized by ‘blood deficiency’ in the body. All study participants perceived anemia as an important health problem tending to cause adverse outcomes among WRA and their children. Study participants perceived gutka (chewable tobacco) consumption as an important cause of anemia. Healthcare providers identified short inter-pregnancy intervals, lack of family planning, poor health-seeking behavior, and consumption of unhealthy food as causes of anemia in the district. Consumption of unhealthy food might not be related to related to a poorer knowledge of iron-deficient foods, but economic constraints. This was further endorsed by the healthcare providers who mentioned that most women were too poor to afford iron-rich foods. All men and women were generally well versed with the sources of good nutrition to be consumed by WRA to prevent anemia. Conclusion The findings suggest that the government should plan to develop strategies for poverty-stricken and vulnerable rural women and plan health awareness programs to improve dietary practices, compliance with supplements, and health-seeking behavior among women of reproductive age. There is a need to develop effective counseling strategies and context-specific health education sessions to improve the health-seeking behavior of women and men in the Thatta district of Pakistan. Besides, there is need to address social determinants of health such as poverty that pushes women of poorer socioeconomic strata to eat less nutritious foods and have more anaemia. Therefore, a comprehensive and robust strategic plan need to be adopted by government that focuses not only on the awareness programs, but also aim to reduce inequities that lead to pregnant women eat iron-poor foods, which, in turn, forces them to become anemic."
https://openalex.org/W3159316061,"Saururus chinensis (S chinensis) has been used as an herb to treat edema, jaundice, and gonorrhea. Manassantin B (MNSB), a dineolignan isolated from S chinensis, was identified as a potent adipogenesis/lipogenesis inhibitor (IC50 = 9.3 nM). To explore the underlying mechanism, both adipogenesis and lipogenesis were measured in differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, murine primary preadipocytes and adipose tissue explants upon MNSB treatment. Key regulators of adipogenesis/lipogenesis were downregulated by MNSB treatment, mainly resulting from increased phosphorylation of AMPK which was identified as a vital regulator of adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Moreover, MNSB did not increase AMPK phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 cells transfected with Prkaa1 (encoding protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1) siRNA or adipose tissue explants isolated from adipose-specific Prkaa1-disrupted mice (Prkaa1Δad ). In diet-induced obese C57BL/6N mice, MNSB displayed preventive and therapeutic effects on obesity accompanied by decreased adipocyte size. MNSB was also found to increase AMPK phosphorylation both in subcutaneous white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue in vivo. These findings suggest that MNSB can be a new therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of obesity and other related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3157124704,"Background Birth weight, birth length, and gestational age are major indicators of newborn health. Several prenatal exposure factors influence the fetal environment. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of prenatal exposure factors, including socio-demographic, behavioural, dietary, physical activity, clinical and environmental on birth outcomes through the mediation of Favourable Fetal Growth Conditions (FFGC). Methods Data was obtained from six hundred and fifty-six Mother and Child in the Environment birth cohort study in Durban, South Africa from 2013 to 2017. We adopted structural equation models which evaluate the direct and indirect effects by allowing multiple simultaneous equations to incorporate confounding and mediation. Results A significant direct and indirect effect of FFGC on newborn weight, length, and gestational age was seen. Gestational weight gain and maternal body mass index in the first trimester exerted a mediation effect between maternal behavioural risk factors and FFGC. Similarly, the level of physical activity during pregnancy was associated with decreased gestational weight gain. The effects of maternal characteristics on newborn weight, length, and gestational age were largely indirect, operating through FFGC as a latent variable. Conclusions Gestational weight gain and maternal pre-gestational BMI were observed to mediate the association between prenatal behavioural risk factors and favourable fetal growth conditions. Trial registration Retrospectively registered from 01 March 2013."
