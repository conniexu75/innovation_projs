AT1R blockers (ARBs) have been widely used in clinical settings as anti-hypertensive drugs and share a similar chemical scaffold, although even minor variations can lead to distinct therapeutic efficacies toward cardiovascular etiologies. The structural basis for AT1R modulation by different peptide and non-peptide ligands has remained elusive. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human AT1R in complex with an inverse agonist olmesartan (BenicarTM), a highly potent anti-hypertensive drug. Olmesartan is anchored to the receptor primarily by the residues Tyr-351.39, Trp-842.60, and Arg-167ECL2, similar to the antagonist ZD7155, corroborating a common binding mode of different ARBs. Using docking simulations and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified specific interactions between AT1R and different ARBs, including olmesartan derivatives with inverse agonist, neutral antagonist, or agonist activities. We further observed that the mutation N1113.35A in the putative sodium-binding site affects binding of the endogenous peptide agonist angiotensin II but not the β-arrestin-biased peptide TRV120027.

Overstimulation of AT1R leads to diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular hypertrophy, and fibrosis, whereas blocking the activity of AT1R lowers blood pressure (3de Gasparo M. Catt K.J.

Considering the critical roles of AT1R in cardiovascular pathophysiology, AT1R blockers (ARBs) have been developed and clinically used for the treatment of hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and renal failure (5Burnier M.

Although most ARBs are considered to be neutral AT1R antagonists, olmesartan, for example, is an established inverse agonist toward inositol phosphate (IP) production (11Miura S. Fujino M. Hanzawa H.

In addition to anti-hypertensive activity, some ARBs also show variable efficacies toward protection against organ damage in diabetic nephropathy, cardiac hypertrophy, arrhythmia, and renal failure (5Burnier M. Brunner H.R. Angiotensin II receptor antagonists.Lancet. 2000; 355: 637-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Multiple studies suggest that such additional tissue-protective benefits from treatment with ARBs may be mediated by AT1R β-arrestin signaling, although the structural basis for differential activation of this mechanism by ARBs is unknown (8Kim J. Ahn S. Ren X.R. Whalen E.J. Reiter E. Wei H. Lefkowitz R.J. Functional antagonism of different G protein-coupled receptor kinases for β-arrestin-mediated angiotensin II receptor signaling.Proc. Natl.

AngII analogs, such as TRV120027, lacking G protein agonism but activating β-arrestin signaling, protect the heart and vasculature in a pathological setting better than common ARBs (2Balakumar P.

Recently, we determined the room temperature crystal structure of AT1R in complex with its antagonist ZD7155 using serial femtosecond crystallography at an x-ray free-electron laser (12Zhang H. Unal H. Gati C. Han G.W. Liu W. Zatsepin N.A. James D. Wang D. Nelson G. Weierstall U. Sawaya M.R. Xu Q. Messerschmidt M. Williams G.J. Boutet S. Yefanov O.M. White T.A. Wang C. Ishchenko A.

Structure of the angiotensin receptor revealed by serial femtosecond crystallography.Cell. 2015; 161: 833-844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Here, we further elucidated the function of a representative inverse agonist by solving the crystal structure of olmesartan-bound AT1R using conventional x-ray cryo-crystallography at a synchrotron source. Comparison of the two AT1R structures revealed similar conformations of the receptor and conserved molecular recognition modes for antagonist and inverse agonist toward AT1R. Molecular docking simulations and site-directed mutagenesis led to identification of residues in AT1R that differentially interact with ARBs, as well as olmesartan derivatives in which specific modifications altered pharmacological properties from inverse agonism to neutral antagonism and partial agonism. Our results thus revealed a paradigm for pharmacological modulation of functional selectivity that might be generally applicable to other ARBs interacting with AT1R. Furthermore, mutagenesis of the conserved residues in the putative sodium-binding pocket suggested their involvement in AT1R regulation by the β-arrestin biased peptide ligand TRV120027. DNA encoding the human AT1R was optimized for expression in insect cells and synthesized by GenScript. The construct used for the AT1R-olmesartan structure has truncations of residues 1, 7–16, and 316–359. The apocytochrome b562 RIL from Escherichia coli with mutations M7W, H102I, and R106L (BRIL (13Chun E. Thompson A.A. Liu W. Roth C.B. Griffith M.T. Katritch V. Kunken J. Xu F. Cherezov V.

The BRIL-AT1R chimera sequence was subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen), with N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) signal sequence, a FLAG tag, a His10 tag, and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site. The BRIL-AT1R protein was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Cells expressing the BRIL-AT1R protein were lysed by repeated washing and centrifuging with the hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl) and the high osmotic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.0 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm KCl), adding the EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). The washed membranes were suspended in the hypotonic buffer with 100 μm olmesartan (Sigma). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the membranes were then solubilized in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace), 0.2% (w/v) cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS, Sigma), and 20% (v/v) glycerol, for 4 h. The supernatant containing the solubilized BRIL-AT1R protein was isolated by high speed centrifugation and then bound to TALON IMAC resin (Clontech) overnight. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of washing buffer I (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 0.02% (w/v) CHS, 20 mm imidazole, and 20 μm olmesartan) and 10 column volumes of washing buffer II (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) DDM, 0.01% (w/v) CHS, 50 mm imidazole, and 20 μm olmesartan). The BRIL-AT1R protein was eluted by 3 column volumes of eluting buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) DDM, 0.004% (w/v) CHS, 300 mm imidazole, and 100 μm olmesartan). The BRIL-AT1R protein was then treated overnight with His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease and peptide:N-glycosidase F to cleave the tags and glycosylation sites and concentrated to 30 mg/ml with a 100-kDa cutoff concentrator (Vivaspin) for crystallization. The protein yield and monodispersity were tested by analytical size exclusion chromatography. The BRIL-AT1R protein was reconstituted in lipidic cubic phase (LCP) by mixing the protein with monoolein supplemented with 10% cholesterol using a lipid syringe mixer (14Caffrey M. Cherezov V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 706-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Crystallization trials were performed by an NT8-LCP robot (Formulatrix) in 96-well glass sandwich plates (Marienfeld) using 40 nl of protein-loaded LCP and 800 nl of precipitant solution per well. Plates were stored at 20 °C and imaged using a Rock Imager 1000 (Formulatrix). The crystals grew in the condition of 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 400 mm KH2PO4, 25% (v/v) PEG400, and 6% (v/v) DMSO. The crystals were harvested using micromounts (MiTeGen) directly from LCP and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for diffraction data collection. Crystallographic data collection was performed at 23ID-D beamline (GM/CA) of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. An unattenuated 10-μm minibeam with a wavelength of 1.0330 Å was used at 1 s exposure and 1.0° oscillation. Diffraction data were collected using a Pilatus3 6M detector from four non-overlapping spots on a single cryo-cooled at 100K crystal of 70 × 70 × 15 μm3 in size and then integrated and scaled using XDS (15Kabsch W.

The overall model has a good stereochemistry with no Ramachandran outliers (94.3% in favored and 5.7% in allowed regions) as determined by MolProbity (21Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J.

The initial receptor docking model was generated by adding missing side chains and hydrogen atoms and by optimizing their conformations, followed by generation of soft potential maps of the receptor in a large box (30 × 30 × 30 Å3) covering the extracellular half of the receptor. Molecular models of compounds were generated from two-dimensional representations, and their three-dimensional geometry was optimized using MMFF-94 force field (22Halgren T.A. Merck molecular force field. I. Basis, form, scope, parameterization, and performance of MMFF94.J. Comp. Chem. 1996; 17: 490-519Crossref Scopus (4313) Google Scholar). Molecular docking employed biased probability Monte Carlo optimization of the ligand internal coordinates in the grid potentials of the receptor (23Totrov M. Abagyan R. Flexible protein-ligand docking by global energy optimization in internal coordinates.Proteins. 1997; : 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To ensure convergence of the docking procedure, at least five independent docking runs were performed for each ligand starting from a random conformation; Monte Carlo sampling and optimization were performed at “thoroughness” parameter set to 30. The objective energy function included the ligand internal strain and a weighted sum of the grid map values in ligand atom centers. Up to 30 alternative complex conformations of the ligand-receptor complex were generated and rescored using the ICM binding score function (24Bursulaya B.D. Totrov M. Abagyan R. Brooks 3rd, C.L.

The results of individual docking runs for each ligand were considered consistent if at least three of the five docking runs produced similar ligand conformations (root mean square deviation of <2.0 Å) and Binding Score <−20.0 kJ/mol. All calculations were performed using 32-core AMD Opteron 2.3 GHz work station running Linux CentOS 6, taking about 10 min/ligand. The unbiased docking procedure did not use distance restraints or any other a priori derived information for the ligand-receptor interactions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the human AT1R with N-terminal HA-tag (HA-AT1R) was originally cloned into the expression vector pMT3 at the EcoRI and NotI sites. The single mutants were constructed by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis strategy as described previously (26Unal H. Jagannathan R. Bhat M.B. Karnik S.S. Ligand-specific conformation of extracellular loop-2 in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 16341-16350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). COS1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 100 IU of penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma). Cells were seeded onto poly-d-lysine-treated cell culture plates at a density of 3 × 106 cells per 10-cm diameter plate. After overnight culture, the cells were transiently transfected with wild-type or mutant AT1R DNA using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ligand binding was analyzed using total membranes prepared from COS1 transiently expressing wild-type HA-AT1R and BRIL-AT1R constructs. Transfected/infected cells were harvested in osmotic lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) homogenized by a dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was incubated by rotating for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 × g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 37,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The precipitate containing the total membranes was suspended in membrane binding buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.006% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. For both saturation and competition binding assays, 10 μg of homogeneous cell membrane was used per well as described above. Saturation binding assays were performed under equilibrium conditions with 125I-AngII (gift from Dr. Robert Speth, University of Mississippi) concentrations ranging between 0.125 and 12 nm (specific activity, 2176 Ci/mmol) as triplicates in 96-well plates for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (27Unal H. Jagannathan R. Bhatnagar A. Tirupula K. Desnoyer R. Karnik S.S. Long range effect of mutations on specific conformational changes in the extracellular loop 2 of angiotensin II type 1 receptor.J.

The cells were harvested by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (102 × 256 mm), which were extensively washed with washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). The bound ligand fraction was determined as the counts/min using a scintillation counter (MicroBeta2 Plate Counter, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The binding kinetics were analyzed by the nonlinear curve-fitting program LigandR. The means ± S.E. for the Kd and Bmax values were calculated. Saturation binding assays were performed under equilibrium conditions, with [3H]olmesartan (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) concentrations ranging between 0.125 and 12 nm (specific activity, 16 Ci/mmol) as duplicates in 96-well plates for 1 h at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10−5 m olmesartan (gift from Daichi-Sankyo Co., Japan). The cells were harvested by filtering the binding mixture through Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters (102 × 256 mm), which were extensively washed with washing buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). The filter membranes were soaked in 5 ml of Ecoscint A scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The bound ligand fraction was determined as the disintegrations/min using a Beckman LS 6000 Liquid Scintillation Counter (Global Medical Instrumentation). The binding kinetics were analyzed by nonlinear curve fitting. The means ± S.E. for the Kd and Bmax values were calculated. Competition binding assays were performed under equilibrium conditions, with 2 nm radioligand and concentrations of the competing ligand ranging between 0.04 and 1000 nm. The binding kinetics were analyzed by the nonlinear curve-fitting program GraphPad Prism 5. The means ± S.E. for the IC50 values were calculated. Olmesartan derivatives were gifts from Daichi-Sankyo Co., Japan. Losartan was a gift from Merck, and candesartan was a gift from Astra Zeneca. Telmisartan and eprosartan were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and valsartan was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals. Calcium levels were measured using FLIPR® calcium 5 assay kit (Molecular Devices). A day before the calcium experiments, HA-AT1R- and BRIL-AT1R-transfected cells were seeded at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 100 μl of medium onto a 96-well clear bottom black cell culture plate that was pre-coated with poly-l-lysine. The plate was maintained in a cell culture incubator set at 37 °C for 26–28 h. On the day of the experiment, cells were initially serum-starved for 2 h by replacing the medium with 80 μl of serum-free DMEM. Following serum starvation, 100 μl of calcium-sensitive dye along with 2× (2.5 mm final concentration) probenecid (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the cells. During this step, for antagonist dose-response curves, 20 μl of desired concentrations of antagonist from a 10× stock prepared in D-PBS (1.47 mm KH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 2.67 mm KCl, 8.1 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3) were added to the cells. For all other wells 20 μl of D-PBS was added. The cells were maintained for 30 min in the cell culture incubator set at 37 °C and another 30 min at room temperature. During the incubation, ligands at 5× the desired final concentration in D-PBS were prepared in a U-bottom 96-well plate. Both the cells and ligand containing 96-well plates were loaded on to a Flexstation 3 instrument (Molecular Devices). The instrument was programmed in FLEX mode to add ligands (50 μl at 5× concentration) to the cells and to monitor the fluorescence before and after adding the ligands. During measurements of agonist dose response, AngII was added at various concentrations. 100 nm AngII was added for antagonist dose-response curves wherein the cells were already pre-treated with the desired concentrations of antagonist during the calcium dye loading step. COS1 cells (cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes), 24 h after transfection, were labeled for 24 h with [3H]myoinositol (1.5 mCi/Petri dish), 22 Ci/mmol specific activity (Amersham Biosciences), at 37 °C in DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum. The labeled cells were washed with serum-free medium three times and incubated with DMEM containing 10 mm LiCl for 20 min; specified ligands (1 μm final concentration) were added, and incubation was continued for another 60 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and total soluble IP was extracted from the cells by the perchloric acid extraction method. The amount of [3H]IP in the perchloric acid extract was counted. 24 h after transfection, cells were split into 12-well plates at a density of 500,000 cells per well. After an additional 24 h, cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS: 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 137 mm NaCl, 5.36 mm KCl, 1.26 mm CaCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 4.17 mm NaHCO3, 5.55 mm d-glucose, pH 7.3) with 1% BSA, and HA-hAT1R was labeled with anti-HA antibody (1 μg/ml, Sigma) in HBSS, 1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were then washed twice with HBSS, 1% BSA, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in HBSS for 15 min. All steps prior to cell fixing were carried out on ice to prevent endocytosis of AT1R during processing of the samples. The cells were washed twice with HBSS, 0.5% BSA and then incubated for another 1 h at room temperature in HBSS, 0.5% BSA supplemented with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:1000, Sigma) secondary antibody. The cells were washed twice with HBSS, 0.5% BSA. Finally, the cells were incubated with 400 μl per well of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (0.4 mg/ml) prepared in 0.05 m phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.03% sodium perborate (Sigma) for 10 min in the dar"

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis is involved in cognitive functions and altered in various neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). Ethosuximide (ETH), an anticonvulsant drug is used for the treatment of epileptic seizures. However, the effects of ETH on adult hippocampal neurogenesis and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism(s) are yet unexplored. Herein, we studied the effects of ETH on rat multipotent NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an amyloid β (Aβ) toxin-induced rat model of AD-like phenotypes. ETH potently induced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hippocampus-derived NSC in vitro. ETH enhanced NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation and reduced Aβ toxin-mediated toxicity and neurodegeneration, leading to behavioral recovery in the rat AD model. ETH inhibited Aβ-mediated suppression of neurogenic and Akt/Wnt/β-catenin pathway gene expression in the hippocampus. ETH activated the PI3K·Akt and Wnt·β-catenin transduction pathways that are known to be involved in the regulation of neurogenesis. Inhibition of the PI3K·Akt and Wnt·β-catenin pathways effectively blocked the mitogenic and neurogenic effects of ETH. In silico molecular target prediction docking studies suggest that ETH interacts with Akt, Dkk-1, and GSK-3β. Our findings suggest that ETH stimulates NSC proliferation and differentiation in vitro and adult hippocampal neurogenesis via the PI3K·Akt and Wnt·β-catenin signaling.

In the present study, we hypothesized that ETH may affect the process of adult neurogenesis, and we assessed its effects on NSC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and survival in vitro and in the hippocampal region of the rat brain. We found that ETH potently induces neurogenesis in vitro and in the adult hippocampus. Furthermore, we found that the drug reverses learning and memory deficits in an Aβ-induced model of AD-like phenotypes by enhancing neurogenesis. We next elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying ETH-induced neurogenesis and found that the drug acts by activating the PI3K·Akt/Wnt-β·catenin signaling in the rat brain.

Rats in the control group received normal saline as vehicle. To analyze the effects of ETH on cell proliferation, rats from both control and ETH-treated groups received daily single intraperitoneal injection of BrdU (50 mg/kg of body weight) for five consecutive days (PND 52–56). Animals were sacrificed 4 h after the last BrdU injection at PND 56, and brains were dissected for immunohistochemical detection of proliferating cells. To evaluate the effect on NSC survival and their differentiation potential in neuron and glial cells, a set of animals was allowed to survive for an additional 3 weeks (up to PND 77) after the last BrdU injection. Animals were sacrificed at PND 77 for double immunofluorescence analysis of BrdU and neuronal or glial markers. A rat model of an Aβ-induced AD-like phenotype was prepared as described earlier (31.Tiwari S.K. Agarwal S. Seth B. Yadav A. Nair S. Bhatnagar P. Karmakar M. Kumari M. Chauhan L.K. Patel D.K.

Rats were anesthetized with ketamine (intraperitoneally, 100 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (30 mg/kg of body weight) and fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus. Rats were given a stereotaxic injection of 2 μl of Aβ(1–42) (0.2 μg/μl dissolved in 0.9% normal saline), into both sides of the hippocampus at AP −3.3, L 2.0, V 4.0 (coordinates in mm with respect to bregma), using an autoinjector pump. Two weeks after Aβ administration, rats were treated with ETH (125 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally) for 2 weeks (PND 42–56) as per the following experimental plan. Experimental groups were as follows: Group I (sham control) received stereotaxic 2 μl of normal saline as vehicle; Group II (Aβ group) received a stereotaxic intrahippocampal 2-μl Aβ injection; Group III (Aβ + ETH) consisted of Aβ-injected rats that received ETH; Group IV received ETH; Group V (inactive analog of ETH; succinimide) received succinimide (125 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally) for 2 weeks (PND 42–56); Group VI (Aβ scrambled peptide) received stereotaxic intrahippocampal injection of 2 μl of Aβ scrambled peptide; Group VII (Aβ scrambled peptide + ETH) received scrambled peptide and ETH; Group VIII (succinimide + ETH) received succinimide and ETH. A set of rats was sacrificed at PND 56 for the cell proliferation study, whereas another set was sacrificed at PND 77 for the cell survival/neuronal differentiation study in the DG region and SVZ, as described earlier (31.Tiwari S.K.

NSC was isolated from the hippocampal tissue of embryonic day 12 rat fetuses following our earlier study (32.Mishra D. Tiwari S.K. Agarwal S. Sharma V.P. Chaturvedi R.K. Prenatal carbofuran exposure inhibits hippocampal neurogenesis and causes learning and memory deficits in offspring.Toxicol. Sci. 2012; 127: 84-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hippocampal tissues were dissected in HBSS, minced, and incubated in 0.1% trypsin for 30 min at 37 °C. A single cell suspension was prepared by gentle trituration, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye. Cells were plated in serum-free neurobasal medium containing N-2 supplement (1%), B-27 supplement (2%), EGF (10 ng/ml), basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution. The NSCs were allowed to grow as neurospheres. BrdU and alamar blue cell proliferation assays were carried out to see the effects of ETH on cell proliferation. NSCs were plated in black bottom 96-well microplates at a density of 10,000 cells/well. The cells were treated with different concentrations of ETH (25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μm) dissolved in DMSO for 48 h. Vehicle-treated cells served as a control. After treatment, alamar blue was added, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Background florescence was measured by adding 10 μl of alamar blue solution/well in medium having no cells. Alamar blue dye reduction in term of fluorescence intensity was measured at 530-nm excitation and 590-nm emission. Values of background florescence were subtracted from experimental values. Experiments were performed three times, with three replicates per experiment. Relative cell proliferation = (absorbancesample/absorbancecontrol) × 100. Results were expressed in terms of alamar blue reduction as a percentage of control. Similarly, to assess cell proliferation, control and ETH-treated NSC cultures were labeled with BrdU (20 μm) for 12 h before fixing cells with 4% paraformaldehyde and processing for immunofluorescent analysis. The neurosphere growth kinetics assay was carried out to study the effects of ETH on cell proliferation and neurosphere formation. A hippocampal single cell suspension was plated in a 12-well plate at a density of 50,000 cells/well in neurobasal medium containing B-27, N-2, basic fibroblast growth factor, and EGF. Cultures were treated with ETH (100 μm). The number and size of neurospheres were analyzed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-S inverted fluorescent microscope equipped with a Nikon Digital Sight Ds-Ri1 CCD camera and NIS Elements BR imaging software (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) as described earlier (31.Tiwari S.K.

The sections/cultures were treated with 2 n HCl for 30 min, followed by neutralization with borate buffer. The endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by H2O2, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% NGS, 0.5% BSA, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The sections were subsequently incubated with mouse anti-BrdU primary antibody (1:500) followed by incubation in peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (1:200). Color was developed with 3–3′-diaminobenzidine and visualized under a light microscope. For immunofluorescence analysis, paraformaldehyde-fixed sections/cultures were incubated with mouse anti-phosphohistone H3 (1:500) and anti-BrdU primary antibodies (1:500), followed by Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody, and visualized under an inverted fluorescent microscope.

https://openalex.org/W2278300339,"About two-thirds of human congenital heart disease involves second heart field-derived structures. Histone-modifying enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs), regulate the epigenome; however, their functions within the second heart field remain elusive. Here we demonstrate that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) orchestrates epigenetic silencing of Tgf-β1, a causative factor in congenital heart disease pathogenesis, in a deacetylase-independent manner to regulate development of second heart field-derived structures. In murine embryos lacking HDAC3 in the second heart field, increased TGF-β1 bioavailability is associated with ascending aortic dilatation, outflow tract malrotation, overriding aorta, double outlet right ventricle, aberrant semilunar valve development, bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defects, and embryonic lethality. Activation of TGF-β signaling causes aberrant endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and altered extracellular matrix homeostasis in HDAC3-null outflow tracts and semilunar valves, and pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β rescues these defects. HDAC3 recruits components of the PRC2 complex, methyltransferase EZH2, EED, and SUZ12, to the NCOR complex to enrich trimethylation of Lys-27 on histone H3 at the Tgf-β1 regulatory region and thereby maintains epigenetic silencing of Tgf-β1 specifically within the second heart field-derived mesenchyme. Wild-type HDAC3 or catalytically inactive HDAC3 expression rescues aberrant endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and epigenetic silencing of Tgf-β1 in HDAC3-null outflow tracts and semilunar valves. These findings reveal that epigenetic dysregulation within the second heart field is a predisposing factor for congenital heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2202061330,"The mechanical properties of hamstring muscles are usually inferred from global passive torque/angle relationships, in combination with adjoining tissues crossing the joint investigated. Shear modulus measurement provides an estimate of changes in muscle-tendon stiffness and passive tension. This study aimed to assess the passive individual behavior of each hamstring muscle in different stretching positions using shear wave elastography.The muscle shear modulus of each hamstring muscle was measured during a standardized slow passive knee extension (PKE, 80% of maximal range of motion) on eighteen healthy male volunteers. Firstly, we assessed the reliability of the measurements. Results were good for semitendinosus (ST, CV: 8.9%-13.4%), semimembranosus (SM, CV: 10.3%-11.2%) and biceps femoris long-head (BF-lh, CV: 8.6%-13.3%), but not for biceps femoris short-head (BF-sh, CV: 20.3%-44.9%). Secondly, we investigated each reliable muscle in three stretch positions: 70°, 90° and 110° of hip flexion. The results showed different values of shear modulus for the same amount of perceived stretch, with the highest measurements in the high-flexed hip situation. Moreover, individual muscles displayed different values, with values increasing or BF-lh, SM and ST, respectively. The inter-subject variability was 35.3% for ST, 27.4% for SM and 30.2% for BF-lh.This study showed that the hip needs to be high-flexed to efficiently tension the hamstrings, and reports a higher muscle-tendon stress tolerance at 110° of hip angle. In addition muscles have different passive behaviors, and future works will clarify if it can be linked with rate of injury."
https://openalex.org/W2232604463,"Background Men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) are at high risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission. Asymptomatic STIs are common in MSM and remain undiagnosed and untreated where syndromic management is advocated. Untreated STIs could be contributing to high HIV rates. This study investigated symptomatic (SSTI) and asymptomatic STIs (ASTIs) in MSM in Cape Town. Methods MSM, 18 years and above, were enrolled into this study. Participants underwent clinical and microbiological screening for STIs. Urine, oro-pharyngeal and anal swab specimens were collected for STI analysis, and blood for HIV and syphilis screening. A psychosocial and sexual questionnaire was completed. STI specimens were analysed for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) and Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection. Results 200 MSM were recruited with a median age of 32 years (IQR 26–39.5). Their median number of sex partners within the last year was 5 (IQR 2–20). 155/200 (78%) reported only male sex partners while 45/200 (23%) reported sex with men and women. 77/200 (39%) reported transactional sex. At enrolment, 88/200 (44%) were HIV positive and 8/112 (7%) initially HIV-negative participants seroconverted during the study. Overall, 47/200 (24%) screened positive for either NG or CT. There were 32 MSM (16%) infected with NG and 7 (3.5%) of these men had NG infections at two anatomical sites (39 NG positive results in total). Likewise, there were 23 MSM (12%) infected with CT and all these men had infections at only one site. Eight of the 47 men (17%) were infected with both NG and CT. ASTI was more common than SSTI irrespective of anatomical site, 38 /200 (19%) versus 9/200 (5%) respectively (p<0.001). The anus was most commonly affected, followed by the oro-pharynx and then urethra. Asymptomatic infection was associated with transgender identity (OR 4.09 CI 1.60–5.62), ≥5 male sex partners in the last year (OR 2.50 CI 1.16–5.62) and transactional sex (OR 2.33 CI 1.13–4.79) but not with HIV infection. Conclusions Asymptomatic STI was common and would not have been detected using a syndromic management approach. Although molecular screening for NG/CT is costly, in our study only four MSM needed to be screened to detect one case. This supports dual NG/CT molecular screening for MSM, which, in the case of confirmed NG infections, may trigger further culture-based investigations to determine gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility in the current era of multi-drug resistant gonorrhoea."
https://openalex.org/W2253209890,"Mast cell (MC) degranulation is the foundation of the acute phase of allergic rhinitis (AR). Previously, downregulation of GATA binding protein 3 (GATA-3) was shown to suppress MC activation in an AR mouse model. Binding of microRNA-135a (miR-135a) to GATA-3 was also observed, and overexpression of this miRNA decreased GATA-3 mRNA and protein expression. However, the effects of miR-135a on MCs during AR are currently unknown. In the present study, we utilized a lentiviral (LV) vector to intranasally administer miR-135a to ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized AR mice. Following miR-135a treatment, the total serum IgE concentration observed during AR was significantly reduced. In the nasal mucosa, the expression of T-box expressed in T cells (T-bet) was higher, whereas that of GATA-3 was lower in the AR mice following miRNA treatment. Notably, during AR, the ratio of type 1 T-helper cells (Th1) to type 2 (Th2) cells in the spleen is unbalanced, favoring Th2. However, administering miR-135a to the AR mice appeared to balance this ratio by increasing and decreasing the percentage of Th1 and Th2 cells, respectively. MiR-135a also appeared to strongly suppress the infiltration of eosinophils and MCs into the nasal mucosa, and it was specifically localized in the MCs, suggesting that its influence is modulated through regulation of GATA-3 in these cells. Additional work identifying the full therapeutic potential of miR-135a in the treatment of AR and diseases involving allergen-induced inflammation is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2219504188,"The impact of reforestation on soil organic carbon (OC), especially in deep layer, is poorly understood and deep soil OC stabilization in relation with aggregation and vegetation type in afforested area is unknown. Here, we collected topsoil (0-15 cm) and deep soil (30-45 cm) from six paired coniferous forests (CF) and broad-leaved forests (BF) reforested in the early 1990s in subtropical China. Soil aggregates were separated by size by dry sieving and OC stability was measured by closed-jar alkali-absorption in 71 incubation days. Soil OC concentration and mean weight diameter were higher in BF than CF. The cumulative carbon mineralization (Cmin, mg CO2-C kg-1 soil) varied with aggregate size in BF and CF topsoils, and in deep soil, it was higher in larger aggregates than in smaller aggregates in BF, but not CF. The percentage of soil OC mineralized (SOCmin, % SOC) was in general higher in larger aggregates than in smaller aggregates. Meanwhile, SOCmin was greater in CF than in BF at topsoil and deep soil aggregates. In comparison to topsoil, deep soil aggregates generally exhibited a lower Cmin, and higher SOCmin. Total nitrogen (N) and the ratio of carbon to phosphorus (C/P) were generally higher in BF than in CF in topsoil and deep soil aggregates, while the same trend of N/P was only found in deep soil aggregates. Moreover, the SOCmin negatively correlated with OC, total N, C/P and N/P. This work suggests that reforested vegetation type might play an important role in soil OC storage through internal nutrient cycling. Soil depth and aggregate size influenced OC stability, and deep soil OC stability could be altered by vegetation reforested about 20 years."
https://openalex.org/W2194625641,"Biomass, nutrient removal capacity, lipid productivity and morphological changes of Chlorella sorokiniana and Desmodesmus communis were investigated in mixed wastewaters with different CO2 concentrations. Under optimal condition, which was 1:3 ratio of swine wastewater to second treated municipal wastewater with 5% CO2, the maximum biomass concentrations were 1.22 g L-1 and 0.84 g L-1 for C. sorokiniana and D. communis, respectively. Almost all of the ammonia and phosphorus were removed, the removal rates of total nitrogen were 88.05% for C. sorokiniana and 83.18% for D. communis. Lipid content reached 17.04% for C. sorokiniana and 20.37% for D. communis after 10 days culture. CO2 aeration increased intracellular particle numbers of both microalgae and made D. communis tend to be solitary. The research suggested the aeration of CO2 improve the tolerance of microalgae to high concentration of NH4-N, and nutrient excess stress could induce lipid accumulation of microalgae."
https://openalex.org/W2180516383,"The stability of post-traumatic growth over time and the relationship between post-traumatic growth and traditional distress outcomes remains unclear. We tracked post-traumatic growth in a population-based sample of colorectal cancer patients from soon after diagnosis to five years subsequently to assess the heterogeneity of a post-traumatic growth response to cancer over time and describe the simultaneous and longitudinal relationships between post-traumatic growth and psychological distress. 1966 colorectal patients who were five months post diagnosis were assessed six times over a five year period. There was considerable heterogeneity associated with both psychological distress and benefit finding scores over time. However, both for benefit finding and psychological distress, the variation in individual scores suggested an underlying positive linear trend and both lagged and lagged change components. Specifically, benefit finding and psychological distress are mutual leading indicators of each other. First, benefit finding served as a leading indicator of distress, in that increases in reported benefit finding from year to year predicted higher future increases in psychological distress. As well, in an inverse relationship, psychological distress served as a leading indicator of benefit finding, such that increases in reported distress from year to year predicted lower future increases in benefit finding. Post-traumatic growth may reflect patients coping efforts to enhance perceptions of wellbeing in response to escalating cancer–related threats, acting as harbinger of increasing trajectories of psychological distress. This explanation is consistent with a cognitive dissonance response in which threats to the integrity of the self then lead to a tendency to accentuate positive aspects of the self."
https://openalex.org/W2178255472,"Right ventricular (RV) function has increasingly being recognized as an important predictor for morbidity and mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The increased RV after-load increase RV work in PAH. We used time-resolved 3D phase contrast MRI (4D flow MRI) to derive RV kinetic energy (KE) work density and energy loss in the pulmonary artery (PA) to better characterize RV work in PAH patients.4D flow and standard cardiac cine images were obtained in ten functional class I/II patients with PAH and nine healthy subjects. For each individual, we calculated the RV KE work density and the amount of viscous dissipation in the PA.PAH patients had alterations in flow patterns in both the RV and the PA compared to healthy subjects. PAH subjects had significantly higher RV KE work density than healthy subjects (94.7±33.7 mJ/mL vs. 61.7±14.8 mJ/mL, p = 0.007) as well as a much greater percent PA energy loss (21.1±6.4% vs. 2.2±1.3%, p = 0.0001) throughout the cardiac cycle. RV KE work density and percent PA energy loss had mild and moderate correlations with RV ejection fraction.This study has quantified two kinetic energy metrics to assess RV function using 4D flow. RV KE work density and PA viscous energy loss not only distinguished healthy subjects from patients, but also provided distinction amongst PAH patients. These metrics hold promise as imaging markers for RV function."
https://openalex.org/W2191906895,"Since the feed cost is a major determinant of profitability in poultry industry, how to improve feed efficiency through genetic selection is an intriguing subject for breeders and producers. As a more suitable indicator assessing feed efficiency, residual feed intake (RFI) is defined as the difference between observed and expected feed intake based on maintenance and growth. However, the genetic mechanisms responsible for RFI in chickens are still less well appreciated. In this study, we investigated the duodenal transcriptome architecture of extreme RFI phenotypes in the six brown-egg dwarf hens (three per group) using RNA sequencing technology. Among all mapped reads, an average of 75.62% fell into annotated exons, 5.50% were located in introns, and the remaining 18.88% were assigned to intergenic regions. In total, we identified 41 promising candidate genes by differential expression analysis between the low and high RFI groups. Furthermore, qRT-PCR assays were designed for 10 randomly chosen genes, and nine (90.00%) were successfully validated. Functional annotation analyses revealed that these significant genes belong to several specific biological functions related to digestibility, metabolism and biosynthesis processes as well as energy homeostasis. We also predicted 253 intergenic coding transcripts, and these transcripts were mainly involved in fundamental biological regulation and metabolism processes. Our findings provided a pioneering exploration of biological basis underlying divergent RFI using RNA-Seq, which pinpoints promising candidate genes of functional relevance, is helpful to guide future breeding strategies to optimize feed efficiency and assists in improving the current gene annotation in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2145686791,"The objective of this work was to study the co-composting process of wastes from the winery and distillery industry with animal manures, using the classical chemical methods traditionally used in composting studies together with advanced instrumental methods (thermal analysis, FT-IR and CPMAS 13C NMR techniques), to evaluate the development of the process and the quality of the end-products obtained. For this, three piles were elaborated by the turning composting system, using as raw materials winery-distillery wastes (grape marc and exhausted grape marc) and animal manures (cattle manure and poultry manure). The classical analytical methods showed a suitable development of the process in all the piles, but these techniques were ineffective to study the humification process during the composting of this type of materials. However, their combination with the advanced instrumental techniques clearly provided more information regarding the turnover of the organic matter pools during the composting process of these materials. Thermal analysis allowed to estimate the degradability of the remaining material and to assess qualitatively the rate of OM stabilization and recalcitrant C in the compost samples, based on the energy required to achieve the same mass losses. FT-IR spectra mainly showed variations between piles and time of sampling in the bands associated to complex organic compounds (mainly at 1420 and 1540 cm-1) and to nitrate and inorganic components (at 875 and 1384 cm-1, respectively), indicating composted material stability and maturity; while CPMAS 13C NMR provided semi-quantitatively partition of C compounds and structures during the process, being especially interesting their variation to evaluate the biotransformation of each C pool, especially in the comparison of recalcitrant C vs labile C pools, such as Alkyl /O-Alkyl ratio."
https://openalex.org/W2340625298,"Background Gene-environment interactions mediate through the placenta and shape the fetal brain development. Between the environmental determinants of the fetal brain, maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy has been shown to negatively influence the infant temperament development. This in turn may have adverse consequences on the infant neurodevelopment extending throughout the entire life-span. However little is known about the underlying biological mechanisms of the effects of maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy on infant temperament. Environmental stressors such as maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy activate the stress response cascade that in turn drives the increase in the cellular energy demand of vital organs with high metabolic rates such as, in pregnancy, the placenta. Key players of the stress response cascade are the mitochondria. Results Here, we tested the expression of all 13 protein-coding genes encoded by the mitochondria in 108 placenta samples from the Stress in Pregnancy birth cohort, a study that aims at determining the influence of in utero exposure to maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy on infant temperament. We showed that the expression of the protein-coding mitochondrial-encoded gene MT-ND2 was positively associated with indices of maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy including Prenatal Perceived Stress (β = 0.259; p-regression = 0.004; r2-regression = 0.120), State Anxiety (β = 0.218; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.153), Trait Anxiety (β = 0.262; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.129) and Pregnancy Anxiety Total (β = 0.208; p-regression = 0.010; r2-regression = 0.103). In the meantime MT-ND2 was negatively associated with the infant temperament indices of Activity Level (β = -0.257; p-regression = 0.008; r2-regression = 0.165) and Smile and Laughter (β = -0.286; p-regression = 0.036; r2-regression = 0.082). Additionally, MT-ND6 was associated with the maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy index of Prenatal Perceived Stress (β = -0.231; p-regression = 0.004; r2-regression = 0.120), while MT-CO2 was associated with the maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy indices of State Anxiety (β = 0.206; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.153) and Trait Anxiety (β = 0.205; p-regression = 0.003; r2-regression = 0.129). Conclusions Our data support the role of mitochondria in responding to maternal psychosocial stress in pregnancy, as assessed in placenta, while also suggesting an important role for the mitochondria in the infant temperament development."
https://openalex.org/W2180804111,"In-vitro expansion of insulin-producing cells from adult human pancreatic islets could provide an abundant cell source for diabetes therapy. However, proliferation of β-cell-derived (BCD) cells is associated with loss of phenotype and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Nevertheless, BCD cells maintain open chromatin structure at β-cell genes, suggesting that they could be readily redifferentiated. The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) pathway has been implicated in EMT in a range of cell types. Here we show that human islet cell expansion in vitro involves upregulation of the TGFβ pathway. Blocking TGFβ pathway activation using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against TGFβ Receptor 1 (TGFBR1, ALK5) transcripts inhibits BCD cell proliferation and dedifferentiation. Treatment of expanded BCD cells with ALK5 shRNA results in their redifferentiation, as judged by expression of β-cell genes and decreased cell proliferation. These effects, which are reproducible in cells from multiple human donors, are mediated, at least in part, by AKT-FOXO1 signaling. ALK5 inhibition synergizes with a soluble factor cocktail to promote BCD cell redifferentiation. The combined treatment may offer a therapeutically applicable way for generating an abundant source of functional insulin-producing cells following ex-vivo expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2190577595,"We present here the first cases in Neandertals of congenital clefts of the arch of the atlas. Two atlases from El Sidrón, northern Spain, present respectively a defect of the posterior (frequency in extant modern human populations ranging from 0.73% to 3.84%), and anterior (frequency in extant modern human populations ranging from 0.087% to 0.1%) arch, a condition in most cases not associated with any clinical manifestation. The fact that two out of three observable atlases present a low frequency congenital condition, together with previously reported evidence of retained deciduous mandibular canine in two out of ten dentitions from El Sidrón, supports the previous observation based on genetic evidence that these Neandertals constituted a group with close genetic relations. Some have proposed for humans and other species that the presence of skeletal congenital conditions, although without clinical significance, could be used as a signal of endogamy or inbreeding. In the present case this interpretation would fit the general scenario of high incidence of rare conditions among Pleistocene humans and the specific scenariothat emerges from Neandertal paleogenetics, which points to long-term small and decreasing population size with reduced and isolated groups. Adverse environmental factors affecting early pregnancies would constitute an alternative, non-exclusive, explanation for a high incidence of congenital conditions. Further support or rejection of these interpretations will come from new genetic and skeletal evidence from Neandertal remains."

This study aimed to estimate income-related inequality in self-reported health status (SRHS) in 2000 and 2013, before and after the reform, for the entire adult Chilean population.Using data on equivalized household income and adult SRHS from the 2000 and 2013 CASEN surveys (independent samples of 101 046 and 172 330 adult participants, respectively) we estimated Erreygers concentration indices (CIs) for above average SRHS for both years. We also decomposed the contribution of both ""legitimate"" standardizing variables (age and sex) and ""illegitimate"" variables (income, education, occupation, ethnicity, urban/rural, marital status, number of people living in the household, and healthcare entitlement).There was a significant concentration of above average SRHS favoring richer people in Chile in both years, which was less pronounced in 2013 than 2000 (Erreygers corrected CI 0.165 [Standard Error, SE 0.007] in 2000 and 0.047 [SE 0.008] in 2013). To help interpret the magnitude of this decline, adults in the richest fifth of households were 33% more likely than those in the poorest fifth to report above-average health in 2000, falling to 11% in 2013. In 2013, the contribution of illegitimate factors to income-related inequality in SRHS remained higher than the contribution of legitimate factors.Income-related inequality in SRHS in Chile has fallen after the equity-based healthcare reform. Further research is needed to ascertain how far this fall in health inequality can be attributed to the 2005 healthcare reform as opposed to economic growth and other determinants of health that changed during the period."
https://openalex.org/W2235728801,"The striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) complex is composed of striatin, protein phosphatase PP2A and protein kinases that regulate development in animals and fungi. In the filamentous ascomycete Sordaria macrospora, it is required for fruiting-body development and cell fusion. Here, we report on the presence and function of STRIPAK-associated kinases in ascomycetes. Using the mammalian germinal center kinases (GCKs) MST4, STK24, STK25 and MINK1 as query, we identified the two putative homologs SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 in S. macrospora. A BLASTP search revealed that both kinases are conserved among filamentous ascomycetes. The physical interaction of the striatin homolog PRO11 with SmKIN3 and SmKIN24 were verified by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) interaction studies and for SmKIN3 by co-Immunoprecipitation (co-IP). In vivo localization found that both kinases were present at the septa and deletion of both Smkin3 and Smkin24 led to abnormal septum distribution. While deletion of Smkin3 caused larger distances between adjacent septa and increased aerial hyphae, deletion of Smkin24 led to closer spacing of septa and to sterility. Although phenotypically distinct, both kinases appear to function independently because the double-knockout strain ΔSmkin3/ΔSmkin24 displayed the combined phenotypes of each single-deletion strain."

After finding a linkage between the ST8SIA2 (ST8 alpha-N-acetyl-neuraminide alpha-2, 8-sicalyltransferase 2 gene) locus (15q26) and mixed families with schizophrenia and BD, several studies have reported a significant association between this gene and schizophrenia or BD. We investigated the genetic association between ST8SIA2 and both schizophrenia and BD in the Korean population.A total of 582 patients with schizophrenia, 339 patients with BD, and 502 healthy controls were included. Thirty-one tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the ST8SIA2 region and three other SNPs showing significant associations in previous studies were genotyped. The associations were evaluated by logistic regression analysis using additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models.Fourteen of 34 SNPs showed a nominally significant association (p < 0.05) with at least one diagnostic group. These association trends were strongest for the schizophrenia and combined schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder (BD-I) groups. The strongest association was observed in rs11637898 for schizophrenia (p = 0.0033) and BD-I (p = 0.0050) under the dominant model. The association between rs11637898 and the combined schizophrenia and BD-I group (p = 0.0006, under the dominant model) remained significant after correcting for multiple testing.We identified a possible role of ST8SIA2 in the common susceptibility of schizophrenia and BD-I. However, no association trend was observed for bipolar II disorder. Further efforts are needed to identify a specific phenotype associated with this gene crossing the current diagnostic categories."

They were randomly assigned to either receive instructions on sputum submission using the video before submission (intervention group, n = 100) or standard of care (control group, n = 100). Sputum samples were examined for volume, quality and presence of acid-fast bacilli by experienced laboratory technicians blinded to study groups.

We found that the instructional video intervention was associated with detection of a higher proportion of microscopically confirmed cases (56%, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 45.7–65.9%, sputum smear positive patients in the intervention group versus 23%, 95% CI 15.2–32.5%, in the control group, p <0.0001), an increase in volume of specimen defined as a volume ≥3ml (78%, 95% CI 68.6–85.7%, versus 45%, 95% CI 35.0–55.3%, p <0.0001), and specimens less likely to be salivary (14%, 95% CI 7.9–22.4%, versus 39%, 95% CI 29.4–49.3%, p = 0.0001). Older age, but not the HIV status or sex, modified the effectiveness of the intervention by improving it positively. When asked how well the video instructions were understood, the majority of patients in the intervention group reported to have understood the video instructions well (97%). Most of the patients thought the video would be useful in the cultural setting of Tanzania (92%). Conclusions Sputum submission instructional videos increased the yield of tuberculosis cases through better quality of sputum samples. If confirmed in larger studies, instructional videos may have a substantial effect on the case yield using sputum microscopy and also molecular tests. This low-cost strategy should be considered as part of the efforts to control TB in resource-limited settings. Trial Registration Pan African Clinical Trials Registry PACTR201504001098231"
https://openalex.org/W2248808106,"Quaternary amine of diethylaminoethyl rosin ester (QRMAE), chemically synthesized biocompatible rosin based cationic surfactant, has various biological applications including its use as a food product additive. In this study, we examined the amorphous aggregation behavior of mammalian serum albumins at pH 7.5, i.e., two units above their isoelectric points (pI ~5.5), and the roles played by positive charge and hydrophobicity of exogenously added rosin surfactant QRMAE. The study was carried out on five mammalian serum albumins, using various spectroscopic methods, dye binding assay, circular dichroism and electron microscopy. The thermodynamics of the binding of mammalian serum albumins to cationic rosin modified surfactant were established using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). It was observed that a suitable molar ratio of protein to QRMAE surfactant enthusiastically induces amorphous aggregate formation at a pH above two units of pI. Rosin surfactant QRMAE-albumins interactions revealed a unique interplay between the initial electrostatic and the subsequent hydrophobic interactions that play an important role towards the formation of hydrophobic interactions-driven amorphous aggregate. Amorphous aggregation of proteins is associated with varying diseases, from the formation of protein wine haze to the expansion of the eye lenses in cataract, during the expression and purification of recombinant proteins. This study can be used for the design of novel biomolecules or drugs with the ability to neutralize factor(s) responsible for the aggregate formation, in addition to various other industrial applications."
https://openalex.org/W2338900000,"Background Main impact of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) on livestock consists in reproductive disorders, with teratogenic effects, abortions and stillbirths. SBV pathogenesis and viral placental crossing remain currently poorly understood. Therefore, we implemented an experimental infection of ewes, inoculated with SBV at 45 or 60 days of gestation (dg). Methodology “Mourerous” breed ewes were randomly separated in three groups: eight and nine ewes were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 ml of SBV infectious serum at 45 and 60 dg, respectively (G45 and G60). Six other ewes were inoculated subcutaneously with sterile phosphate buffer saline as control group. All SBV inoculated ewes showed RNAemia consistent with previously published studies, they seroconverted and no clinical sign was reported. Lambs were born at term via caesarian-section, and right after birth they were blood sampled and clinically examined. Then both lambs and ewes were euthanatized and necropsied. Principal Findings/Significance No lambs showed any malformation suggestive of SBV infection and none of them had RNAemia or anti-SBV antibodies prior to colostrum uptake. Positive SBV RNA detection in organs was rare in both G45 and G60 lambs (2/11 and 1/10, respectively). Nevertheless most of the lambs in G45 (9/11) and G60 (9/10) had at least one extraembryonic structure SBV positive by RTqPCR. The number of positive extraembryonic structures was significantly higher in G60 lambs. Time of inoculation (45 or 60 dg) had no impact on the placental colonization success rate but affected the frequency of detecting the virus in the offspring extraembryonic structures by the time of lambing. SBV readily colonized the placenta when ewes were infected at 45 or 60 dg but infection of the fetuses was limited and did not lead to congenital malformations."

In this work a histopathological and microbiological evaluation of TBL in pigs is shown. A total of 352 samples belonging to 171 pigs totally condemned at slaughterhouse due to generalized TBL were sampled and selected for analysis. Pyogranulomatous (56.2%) and granulomatous lesions (20.2%) were observed in all analysed organs. Most of the granulomas observed in both lymph nodes and lungs belonged to more advanced stages of development (stages III and IV) whereas in the liver and the spleen most of lesions belonged to intermediate stages (stages II and III). Different microorganisms were simultaneously detected from TBL in the 42.7% of the animals. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) (38%), coryneform bacteria (40.3%) and streptococci (28.1%) were the main groups of microorganisms detected after bacteriological analysis, with Trueperella pyogenes and Streptococcus suis as the most frequently isolated species. Mycobacteria belonging to MTC were the most frequently detected pathogens in granulomatous and pyogranulomatous lesions in submandibular lymph nodes (32.7%) and coryneform bacteria were the microorganisms more frequently isolated from lungs (25.9%) and spleen samples (37.2%). These results may provide new insights into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this pathology. The importance of coryneform bacteria and streptococci in such processes must be evaluated in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2187234587,"Salmon lice, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Krøyer, 1837), are fish ectoparasites causing significant economic damage in the mariculture of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758. The control of L. salmonis at fish farms relies to a large extent on treatment with anti-parasitic drugs. A problem related to chemical control is the potential for development of resistance, which in L. salmonis is documented for a number of drug classes including organophosphates, pyrethroids and avermectins. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene superfamily is found in all biota and includes a range of drug efflux transporters that can confer drug resistance to cancers and pathogens. Furthermore, some ABC transporters are recognised to be involved in conferral of insecticide resistance. While a number of studies have investigated ABC transporters in L. salmonis, no systematic analysis of the ABC gene family exists for this species. This study presents a genome-wide survey of ABC genes in L. salmonis for which, ABC superfamily members were identified through homology searching of the L. salmonis genome. In addition, ABC proteins were identified in a reference transcriptome of the parasite generated by high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of a multi-stage RNA library. Searches of both genome and transcriptome allowed the identification of a total of 33 genes / transcripts coding for ABC proteins, of which 3 were represented only in the genome and 4 only in the transcriptome. Eighteen sequences were assigned to ABC subfamilies known to contain drug transporters, i.e. subfamilies B (4 sequences), C (11) and G (2). The results suggest that the ABC gene family of L. salmonis possesses fewer members than recorded for other arthropods. The present survey of the L. salmonis ABC gene superfamily will provide the basis for further research into potential roles of ABC transporters in the toxicity of salmon delousing agents and as potential mechanisms of drug resistance."

FDG-PET/CT can identify early during chemotherapy non-responsive lesions within the whole body tumor load. This prospective multicentric proof-of-concept study explores intra-individual metabolic response (mR) heterogeneity as a treatment efficacy biomarker in chemorefractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).Standardized FDG-PET/CT was performed at baseline and after the first cycle of combined sorafenib (600mg/day for 21 days, then 800mg/day) and capecitabine (1700 mg/m²/day administered D1-14 every 21 days). MR assessment was categorized according to the proportion of metabolically non-responding (non-mR) lesions (stable FDG uptake with SUVmax decrease <15%) among all measurable lesions.Ninety-two patients were included. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 8.2 months (95% CI: 6.8-10.5) and 4.2 months (95% CI: 3.4-4.8) respectively. In the 79 assessable patients, early PET-CT showed no metabolically refractory lesion in 47%, a heterogeneous mR with at least one non-mR lesion in 32%, and a consistent non-mR or early disease progression in 21%. On exploratory analysis, patients without any non-mR lesion showed a significantly longer PFS (HR 0.34; 95% CI: 0.21-0.56, P-value <0.001) and OS (HR 0.58; 95% CI: 0.36-0.92, P-value 0.02) compared to the other patients. The proportion of non-mR lesions within the tumor load did not impact PFS/OS.The presence of at least one metabolically refractory lesion is associated with a poorer outcome in advanced mCRC patients treated with combined sorafenib-capecitabine.

https://openalex.org/W2276161387,"Formation of the cardiac valves is an essential component of cardiovascular development. Consistent with the role of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in cardiac valve formation, embryos that are deficient for the BMP regulator BMPER (BMP-binding endothelial regulator) display the cardiac valve anomaly mitral valve prolapse. However, how BMPER deficiency leads to this defect is unknown. Based on its expression pattern in the developing cardiac cushions, we hypothesized that BMPER regulates BMP2-mediated signaling, leading to fine-tuned epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix deposition. In the BMPER-/- embryo, EMT is dysregulated in the atrioventricular and outflow tract cushions compared with their wild-type counterparts, as indicated by a significant increase of Sox9-positive cells during cushion formation. However, proliferation is not impaired in the developing BMPER-/- valves. In vitro data show that BMPER directly binds BMP2. In cultured endothelial cells, BMPER blocks BMP2-induced Smad activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BMP2 increases the Sox9 protein level, and this increase is inhibited by co-treatment with BMPER. Consistently, in the BMPER-/- embryos, semi-quantitative analysis of Smad activation shows that the canonical BMP pathway is significantly more active in the atrioventricular cushions during EMT. These results indicate that BMPER negatively regulates BMP-induced Smad and Sox9 activity during valve development. Together, these results identify BMPER as a regulator of BMP2-induced cardiac valve development and will contribute to our understanding of valvular defects."

https://openalex.org/W2195869758,"The Filtered Back-Projection (FBP) algorithm and its modified versions are the most important techniques for CT (Computerized tomography) reconstruction, however, it may produce aliasing degradation in the reconstructed images due to projection discretization. The general iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms suffer from their heavy calculation burden and other drawbacks. In this paper, an iterative FBP approach is proposed to reduce the aliasing degradation. In the approach, the image reconstructed by FBP algorithm is treated as the intermediate image and projected along the original projection directions to produce the reprojection data. The difference between the original and reprojection data is filtered by a special digital filter, and then is reconstructed by FBP to produce a correction term. The correction term is added to the intermediate image to update it. This procedure can be performed iteratively to improve the reconstruction performance gradually until certain stopping criterion is satisfied. Some simulations and tests on real data show the proposed approach is better than FBP algorithm or some IR algorithms in term of some general image criteria. The calculation burden is several times that of FBP, which is much less than that of general IR algorithms and acceptable in the most situations. Therefore, the proposed algorithm has the potential applications in practical CT systems."
https://openalex.org/W2182514659,"Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) reach sexual maturity earlier, breed rapidly and successfully, and cost less and require less space than other birds raised commercially. Given the value of this species for food production and experimental use, more studies are necessary to determine chromosomal regions and genes associated with gender and breed-differentiation. This study employed Trinity and edgeR for transcriptome analysis of next-generation RNA-seq data, which included 4 tissues obtained from 3 different breeding lines of Japanese quail (random bred control, heavy weight, low weight). Differentially expressed genes shared between female and male tissue contrast groups were analyzed to identify genes related to sexual dimorphism as well as potential novel candidate genes for molecular sexing. Several of the genes identified in the present study as significant sex-related genes have been previously found in avian gene expression analyses (NIPBL, UBAP2), and other genes found differentially expressed in this study and not previously associated with sex-related differences may be considered potential candidates for molecular sexing (TERA, MYP0, PPR17, CASQ2). Additionally, other genes likely associated with neuronal and brain development (CHKA, NYAP), as well as body development and size differentiation (ANKRD26, GRP87) in quail were identified. Expression of homeobox protein regulating genes (HXC4, ISL1) shared between our two sex-related contrast groups (Female Brain vs. Male Brain and Ovary vs. Testis) indicates that these genes may regulate sex-specific anatomical development. Results reveal genetic features of the quail breed and could allow for more effective molecular sexing as well as selective breeding for traits important in commercial production."

In this work we perform an extensive analysis of data sets available for Brazilian proportional elections of legislators and city councilors throughout the period 1970-2014, which embraces two distinct political regimes: a military regime followed by a democratic one. We perform a comparative analysis of elections for legislative positions, in different states and years, through the distribution p(v) of the number of candidates receiving v votes. We show the impact of the different political regimes on the vote distributions. Although p(v) has a common shape, with a scaling behavior, quantitative details change over time and from one electorate to another. In order to interpret the observed features, we propose a multi-species model consisting in a system of nonlinear differential equations, with values of the parameters that reflect the heterogeneity of candidates. In its simplest setting, the model can not explain the cutoff, formed by the most voted candidates, whose success is determined mainly by their peculiar, intrinsic characteristics, such as previous publicity. However, the modeling allows to interpret the scaling of p(v), yielding a predictor of the degree of feedback in the interactions of the electorate. Knowledge of the feedback is relevant beyond the context of elections, since a similar interactivity may occur for other social contagion processes in the same population."

Multitargeting of selected prostanoid receptors yielded a prototype compound, compound 1 (AGN 211377), that antagonizes prostaglandin D2 receptors (DPs) DP1 (49) and DP2 (558), prostaglandin E2 receptors (EPs) EP1 (266) and EP4 (117), prostaglandin F2α receptor (FP) (61), and thromboxane A2 receptor (TP) (11) while sparing EP2, EP3, and prostaglandin I2 receptors (IPs); Kb values (in nanomoles) are given in parentheses. Compound 1 evoked a pronounced inhibition of cytokine/chemokine secretion from lipopolysaccharide or TNF-α stimulated primary human macrophages. These cytokine/chemokines included cluster of designation 40 receptor (CD40), epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating protein 78 (ENA-78), granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), IL-8, IL-18, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (CCL2) (MCP-1), tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). In contrast, the inhibitory effects of most antagonists selective for a single receptor were modest or absent, and selective EP2 receptor blockade increased cytokine release in some instances. Compound 1 also showed clear superiority to the cyclooxygenase inhibitors diclofenac and rofecoxib. These findings reveal that blockade of multiple prostanoid receptors, with absent antagonism of EP2 and IP, may provide more effective anti-inflammatory activity than global suppression of prostanoid synthesis or highly selective prostanoid receptor blockade. These investigations demonstrate the first working example of prostanoid receptor polypharmacology for potentially safer and more effective anti-inflammatory therapeutics by blocking multiple proinflammatory receptors while sparing those with anti-inflammatory activity."
https://openalex.org/W2275729103,"Nrf2 is a master regulator of oxidative stresses through the induction of anti-oxidative genes. Nrf2 plays roles in maintaining murine hematopoietic stem cells and fly intestinal stem cells. The canonical Notch signaling pathway is also crucial for maintaining several types of adult stem cells including muscle stem cells (satellite cells). Here, we show that Dll1 induced Nrf2 expression in myogenic cells. In addition, primary targets of Notch signaling, Hesr1 and Hesr3, were involved in the up-regulation of Nrf2 mRNA and expression of its target genes. In vitro, Nrf2 had anti-myogenic and anti-proliferative effects on primary myoblasts. In vivo, although Nrf2-knockout mice showed decreased expression of its target genes in muscle stem cells, adult muscle stem cells of Nrf2-knockout mice did not exhibit the phenotype. Taken together, in muscle stem cells, the Notch-Hesr-Nrf2 axis is a pathway potentially inducing anti-oxidative genes, but muscle stem cells either do not require Nrf2-mediated anti-oxidative gene expression or they have a complementary system compensating for the loss of Nrf2."

Approaches that enhance monocyte tumor homing and promote their migration will improve the clinical value of these cells as cellular carriers. Previous studies have shown that irradiation (IR) can promote macrophage aggregation in hypoxic regions. To investigate whether IR enhances the infiltration of bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs) into tumors, the infiltration of BMDMs from GFP-transgenic mice in a murine prostate adenocarcinoma TRAMP-C1 model was examined by fluorescence microscopy. IR did not increase the number of BMDMs that infiltrated initially, but did increase monocyte retention within IR-treated tumors for up to 2 weeks. We also showed that BMDMs can take up various imaging and therapeutic agents, although the mobility of BMDMs decreased with increasing load. When BMDMs were differentiated in IR-treated tumor-conditioned medium (IR-CM) in vitro, the nanoparticle load-mediated inhibition of migration was attenuated. These IR-CM-differentiated BMDMs delivered polymer vesicles encapsulating doxorubicin to radiation therapy (RT)-induced hypoxic tumor regions, and enhanced the efficacy of RT. The prolonged retention of monocytes within irradiated tumor tissues and the ability of IR-CM to enhance the migratory ability of cargo-laden BMDMs suggest that monocytes pre-conditioned by IR-CM can potentially act as cellular carriers for targeted therapy following conventional RT."

Here we sought to determine the nature and consistency of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) during the application of oscillatory lower body negative pressure (OLBNP). In 18 volunteers we recorded BP and middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (MCAv) and examined the relationships between BP and MCAv fluctuations during 0.03, 0.05 and 0.07Hz OLBNP. dCA was characterised using project pursuit regression (PPR) and locally weighted scatterplot smoother (LOWESS) plots. Additionally, we proposed a piecewise regression method to statistically determine the presence of a dCA curve, which was defined as the presence of a restricted autoregulatory plateau shouldered by pressure-passive regions. Results show that LOWESS has similar explanatory power to that of PPR. However, we observed heterogeneous patterns of dynamic BP-MCAv relations with few individuals demonstrating clear evidence of a dCA central plateau. Thus, although BP explains a significant proportion of variance, dCA does not manifest as any single characteristic BP-MCAv function."
https://openalex.org/W2194545690,"Purpose The aim of this study was to explore factors contribute to the success of PGD cycles for monogenic diseases. Methods During a 3-year period (January 2009 to December 2012), 184 consecutive ICSI-PGD cycles for monogenic diseases reaching the ovum pick-up and fresh embryo-transfer stage performed at the Reproductive Medicine Center of The First Affiliated Hospital Of Sun Yat-sen University were evaluated. Results ICSI was performed on 2206 metaphase II oocytes, and normal fertilization and cleavage rates were 83.4% (1840/2206) and 96.2% (1770/1840), respectively. In the present study, 60.5% (181/299) of day 3 good-quality embryos developed into good-quality embryos on day 4 after biopsy. Collectively, 42.9% clinical pregnancy rate (79/184) and 28.5% implantation rate (111/389) were presented. In the adjusted linear regression model, the only two significant factors affecting the number of genetically unaffected embryos were the number of biopsied embryos (coefficient: 0.390, 95%CI 0.317–0.463, P = 0.000) and basal FSH level (coefficient: 0.198, 95%CI 0.031–0.365, P = 0.021). In the adjusted binary logistic regression model, the only two significant factors affecting pregnancy outcome were the number of genetically available transferable embryos after PGD (adjusted OR 1.345, 95% CI 1.148–1.575, P = 0.000) and number of oocyte retrieved (adjusted OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.877–0.994, P = 0.031). Conclusion There should be at least four biopsied embryos to obtain at least one unaffected embryos in a PGD system for patients with single gene disorder and under the condition of basal FSH level smaller than 8.0mmol/L. Moreover, if only a low number (< 4) of biopsied embryos are available on day 3, the chance of unaffected embryos for transfer was small, with poor outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2338450765,"SK2- and KV4.2-containing K+ channels modulate evoked synaptic potentials in CA1 pyramidal neurons. Each is coupled to a distinct Ca2+ source that provides Ca2+-dependent feedback regulation to limit AMPA receptor (AMPAR)- and NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated postsynaptic depolarization. SK2-containing channels are activated by Ca2+ entry through NMDARs, whereas KV4.2-containing channel availability is increased by Ca2+ entry through SNX-482 (SNX) sensitive CaV2.3 R-type Ca2+ channels. Recent studies have challenged the functional coupling between NMDARs and SK2-containing channels, suggesting that synaptic SK2-containing channels are instead activated by Ca2+ entry through R-type Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, SNX has been implicated to have off target affects, which would challenge the proposed coupling between R-type Ca2+ channels and KV4.2-containing K+ channels. To reconcile these conflicting results, we evaluated the effect of SK channel blocker apamin and R-type Ca2+ channel blocker SNX on evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 pyramidal neurons from CaV2.3 null mice. The results show that in the absence of CaV2.3 channels, apamin application still boosted EPSPs. The boosting effect of CaV2.3 channel blockers on EPSPs observed in neurons from wild type mice was not observed in neurons from CaV2.3 null mice. These data are consistent with a model in which SK2-containing channels are functionally coupled to NMDARs and KV4.2-containing channels to CaV2.3 channels to provide negative feedback regulation of EPSPs in the spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2191500920,"Reduced pulmonary function and elevated serum cholesterol levels are recognized risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Currently, there is some controversy concerning relationships between cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, serum triglycerides and lung function. However, most previous studies compared patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with healthy controls, and only a small number examined this relationship in population-based cohorts. Moreover, lipoprotein a [Lp(a)], another lipid parameter independently associated with cardiovascular diseases, appears not to have been addressed at all in studies of lung function at the population level. Here, we determined relationships between lung function and several lipid parameters including Lp(a) in 606 older community-dwelling participants (55.1% women, 68±4 years old) from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II). We found a significantly lower forced expiration volume in 1 second (FEV1) in men with low Lp(a) concentrations (t-test). This finding was further substantiated by linear regression models adjusting for known covariates, showing that these associations are statistically significant in both men and women. According to the highest adjusted model, men and women with Lp(a) levels below the 20th percentile had 217.3ml and 124.2ml less FEV1 and 239.0ml and 135.2ml less FVC, respectively, compared to participants with higher Lp(a) levels. The adjusted models also suggest that the known strong correlation between pro-inflammatory parameters and lung function has only a marginal impact on the Lp(a)-pulmonary function association. Our results do not support the hypothesis that higher Lp(a) levels are responsible for the increased CVD risk in people with reduced lung function, at least not in the group of community-dwelling older people studied here."
https://openalex.org/W2191767814,"2,3-dehydrosilybin (DHS) is a minor flavonolignan component of Silybum marianum seed extract known for its hepatoprotective activity. Recently we identified DHS as a potentially cardioprotective substance during hypoxia/reoxygenation in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. This is the first report of positive inotropic effect of DHS on perfused adult rat heart. When applied to perfused adult rat heart, DHS caused a dose-dependent inotropic effect resembling that of catecholamines. The effect was apparent with DHS concentration as low as 10 nM. Suspecting direct interaction with β-adrenergic receptors, we tested whether DHS can trigger β agonist-dependent gene transcription in a model cell line. While DHS alone was unable to trigger β agonist-dependent gene transcription, it enhanced the effect of isoproterenol, a known unspecific β agonist. Further tests confirmed that DHS could not induce cAMP accumulation in isolated neonatal rat cardiomyocytes even though high concentrations (≥ 10 μM) of DHS were capable of decreasing phosphodiesterase activity. Pre-treatment of rats with reserpine, an indole alkaloid which depletes catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings, abolished the DHS inotropic effect in perfused hearts. Our data suggest that DHS causes the inotropic effect without acting as a β agonist. Hence we identify DHS as a novel inotropic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2109987120,"The production of short anticancer peptides in recombinant form is an alternative method for costly chemical manufacturing. However, the limitations of host toxicity, bioactivity and column purification have impaired production in mass quantities. In this study, short cationic peptides were produced in aggregated inclusion bodies by double fusion with a central protein that has anti-cancer activity. The anticancer peptides Tachiplicin I (TACH) and Latarcin 1 (LATA) were fused with the N- and C-terminus of the MAP30 protein, respectively. We successfully produced the recombinant TACH-MAP30-LATA protein and MAP30 alone in E. coli that represented 59% and 68% of the inclusion bodies. The purified form of the inclusion bodies was prepared by eliminating host cell proteins through multiple washing steps and semi-solubilization in alkaline buffer. The purified active protein was recovered by inclusive solubilization at pH 12.5 in the presence of 2 M urea and refolded in alkaline buffer containing oxides and reduced glutathione. The peptide-fusion protein showed lower CC50 values against cancer cells (HepG2, 0.35±0.1 μM and MCF-7, 0.58±0.1 μM) compared with normal cells (WRL68, 1.83±0.2 μM and ARPE19, 2.5±0.1 μM) with outstanding activity compared with its individual components. The presence of the short peptides facilitated the entry of the peptide fusion protein into cancer cells (1.8 to 2.2-fold) compared with MAP30 alone through direct interaction with the cell membrane. The cancer chemotherapy agent doxorubicin showed higher efficiency and selectivity against cancer cells in combination with the peptide- fusion protein. This study provides new data on the mass production of short anticancer peptides as inclusion bodies in E. coli by fusion with a central protein that has similar activity. The product was biologically active against cancer cells compared with normal cells and enhanced the activity and selective delivery of an anticancer chemotherapy agent."
https://openalex.org/W2146722231,"Background There are few long-term outcome reports of unilateral lateral rectus (LR) recession for exotropia including a large number of subjects. Previous reports on unilateral LR recession commonly show extremely low rates of initial overcorrection and large exodrifts after surgery suggesting that the surgical dose may be increased. However, little is known of the long-term outcome of a large unilateral LR recession for exotropia. Objectives To determine long-term outcomes and predictive factors of recurrence after a large unilateral LR recession in patients with exotropia. Data Extraction Retrospective analysis was performed on 92 patients aged 3 to 17 years who underwent 10 mm unilateral LR recession for exotropia of ≤ 25 prism diopters (Δ) with prism and alternate cover testing and were followed up for more than 2 years after surgery. Final success rates within 10Δ of exophoria/tropia and 5Δ of esophoria/tropia at distance in the primary position, improvement in stereopsis and the predictive factors for recurrence were evaluated. Results At 24 months after surgery, 54% of patients had ocular alignment meeting the defined criteria of success, 45% had recurrence and 1% had overcorrection. After a mean follow-up of 39 months, 36% showed success, 63% showed recurrence and 1% resulted in overcorrection. The average time of recurrence was 23.4±14.7 months (range, 1–60 months) and the rate of recurrence per person-year was 23% after unilateral LR recession. Predictive factors of recurrence were a larger preoperative near angle of deviation (>16Δ) and larger initial postoperative exodeviation (>5Δ) at distance. Conclusions Long-term outcome of unilateral LR recession for exotropia showed low success rates with high recurrence, thus should be reserved for patients with a small preoperative near angle of exodeviation."
https://openalex.org/W2195015497,"Formylated peptides are chemotactic agents generated by pathogens. The most relevant peptide is fMLF (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) which participates in several immune functions, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, cytokine release and generation of reactive oxygen species. In macrophages fMLF-dependent responses are dependent on both, an increase in intracellular calcium concentration and on a hyperpolarization of the membrane potential. However, the molecular entity underlying this hyperpolarization remains unknown and it is not clear whether changes in membrane potential are linked to the increase in intracellular Ca2+. In this study, differentiated U937 cells, as a macrophage-like cell model, was used to characterize the fMLF response using electrophysiological and Ca2+ imaging techniques. We demonstrate by means of pharmacological and molecular biology tools that fMLF induces a Ca2+-dependent hyperpolarization via activation of the K+ channel KCa3.1 and thus, enhancing fMLF-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase through an amplification of the driving force for Ca2+ entry. Consequently, enhanced Ca2+ influx would in turn lengthen the hyperpolarization, operating as a positive feedback mechanism for fMLF-induced Ca2+ signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2187514737,"Background The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 156,300 (95% CI 144,100–165,900) Americans living with HIV in 2012 were unaware of their infection. To increase knowledge of HIV status, CDC guidelines seek to make HIV screening a routine part of medical care. This paper examines how routinely California primary care providers test for HIV and how providers’ knowledge of California’s streamlined testing requirements, use of sexual histories, and having an electronic medical record prompt for HIV testing, relate to test offers. Methods We surveyed all ten California health plans offered under health reform’s Insurance Exchange (response rate = 50%) and 322 primary care providers to those plans (response rate = 19%) to assess use of HIV screening and risk assessments. Results Only 31.7% of 60 responding providers reported offering HIV tests to all or most new enrollees and only 8.8% offered an HIV test of blood samples all or most of the time despite the California law requiring that providers offer HIV testing of blood samples in primary care settings. Twenty-eight of the 60 providers (46.6%) were unaware that California had reduced barriers to HIV screening by eliminating the requirement for written informed consent and pre-test counseling. HIV screening of new enrollees all or most of the time was reported by 53.1% of the well-informed providers, but only 7.1% of the less informed providers, a difference of 46 percentage points (95% CI: 21.0%—66.5%). Providers who routinely obtained sexual histories were 29 percentage points (95% CI: 0.2%—54.9%) more likely to screen for HIV all or most of the time than those who did not ask sexual histories. Conclusion Changing HIV screening requirements is important, but not sufficient to make HIV testing a routine part of medical care. Provider education to increase knowledge about the changed HIV testing requirements could positively impact testing rates."

In this study we showed that the induction of LjABCG1 expression was remarkable by methyl jasmonate treatment, and reporter gene experiments indicated that LjABCG1 was strongly expressed in the nodule parenchyma and cell layers adjacent to the root vascular tissue toward the nodule. LjABCG1 was suggested to be localized at the plasma membrane based on the fractionation of microsomal membranes as well as separation via aqueous two-phase partitioning. The physiological functions of LjABCG1 in symbiosis and pathogenesis were analyzed in homologous and heterologous systems. LjABCG1 knock-down L. japonicus plants did not show clear phenotypic differences in nodule formation, and not in defense against Pseudomonas syringae, either. In contrast, when LjABCG1 was expressed in the Arabidopsis pdr8-1 mutant, the penetration frequency of Phytophthora infestans, a potato late blight pathogen, was significantly reduced in LjABCG1/pdr8-1 than in pdr8-1 plants. This finding indicated that LjABCG1, at least partially, complemented the phenotype of pdr8 in Arabidopsis, suggesting the multiple roles of this protein in plant-microbe interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2286487592,"Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has a causative role in several human malignancies. KSHV latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) mediates persistence of viral episomes in latently infected cells. LANA mediates KSHV DNA replication and segregates episomes to progeny nuclei. The structure of the LANA DNA binding domain was recently solved, revealing a positive electrostatic patch opposite the DNA binding surface, which is the site of BET protein binding. Here we investigate the functional role of the positive patch in LANA-mediated episome persistence. As expected, LANA mutants with alanine or glutamate substitutions in the central, peripheral, or lateral portions of the positive patch maintained the ability to bind DNA by EMSA. However, all of the substitution mutants were deficient for LANA DNA replication and episome maintenance. Mutation of the peripheral region generated the largest deficiencies. Despite these deficiencies, all positive patch mutants concentrated to dots along mitotic chromosomes in cells containing episomes, similar to LANA. The central and peripheral mutants, but not the lateral mutants, were reduced for BET protein interaction as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation. However, defects in BET protein binding were independent of episome maintenance function. Overall, the reductions in episome maintenance closely correlated with DNA replication deficiencies, suggesting that the replication defects account for the reduced episome persistence. Therefore, the electrostatic patch exerts a key role in LANA-mediated DNA replication and episome persistence and may act through a host cell partner(s) other than a BET protein or by inducing specific structures or complexes.

The LANA DBD shares common structural features with the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA1 and papillomavirus E2 episome maintenance proteins; however, LANA contains a unique positive electrostatic charged patch on its dorsal surface, opposite the DNA binding interface, which is absent from the EBNA1 and E2 proteins. The positively charged LANA dorsal face has an important role in MHV68 establishment of latent infection in mice, as substitution mutations that altered the peripheral, but not central dorsal positive patch charge resulted in substantial deficiency in expansion of latent infection (45.Correia B.

To investigate if the dorsal positive patch has a role in LANA-mediated episome persistence, we generated a panel of substitution mutants that targeted either the central, peripheral, or lateral regions of the positive patch. We found that mutations of each of the positive patch regions resulted in deficiencies in LANA-mediated DNA replication and episome persistence and that mutating the LANA peripheral positive patch engendered the most severe deficiencies. There was a close correlation of deficiencies in episome persistence and DNA replication, consistent with replication defects accounting for the episome maintenance deficiencies. Some mutations in the LANA dorsal patch reduced BET protein binding; however, the reduction in binding did not correlate with the deficiencies in episome persistence. Uninfected BJAB B lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone) and 15 μg/ml gentamicin. KSHV-infected BCBL-1 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 20% BGS and 15 μg/ml gentamicin. 293T cell were maintained in DMEM supplied with 10% BGS and 15 μg/ml gentamicin. pT7 LANA encodes LANA with an N-terminal T7 epitope tag (52.De León Vázquez E.

The PCR amplification product was then digested 1 h with DpnI to digest template DNA before transformation into Escherichia coli bacteria. LANA Δ33–888 containing each mutation was digested with restriction enzymes AscI and NruI to remove the central Δ33–888 LANA sequence.

https://openalex.org/W1511864673,"The use of high-dose-rate brachytherapy is currently a widespread practice worldwide. The most common isotope source is 192Ir, but 60Co is also becoming available for HDR. One of main advantages of 60Co compared to 192Ir is the economic and practical benefit because of its longer half-live, which is 5.27 years. Recently, Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG, Germany, introduced a new afterloading brachytherapy machine (MultiSource®); it has the option to use either the 60Co or 192Ir HDR source. The source for the Monte Carlo calculations is the new 60Co source (model Co0.A86), which is referred to as the new BEBIG 60Co HDR source and is a modified version of the 60Co source (model GK60M21), which is also from BEBIG.The purpose of this work is to obtain the dosimetry parameters in accordance with the AAPM TG-43U1 formalism with Monte Carlo calculations regarding the BEBIG 60Co high-dose-rate brachytherapy to investigate the required treatment-planning parameters. The geometric design and material details of the source was provided by the manufacturer and was used to define the Monte Carlo geometry. To validate the source geometry, a few dosimetry parameters had to be calculated according to the AAPM TG-43U1 formalism. The dosimetry studies included the calculation of the air kerma strength Sk, collision kerma in water along the transverse axis with an unbounded phantom, dose rate constant and radial dose function. The Monte Carlo code system that was used was EGSnrc with a new cavity code, which is a part of EGS++ that allows calculating the radial dose function around the source. The spectrum to simulate 60Co was composed of two photon energies, 1.17 and 1.33 MeV. Only the gamma part of the spectrum was used; the contribution of the electrons to the dose is negligible because of the full absorption by the stainless-steel wall around the metallic 60Co. The XCOM photon cross-section library was used in subsequent simulations, and the photoelectric effect, pair production, Rayleigh scattering and bound Compton scattering were included in the simulation. Variance reduction techniques were used to speed up the calculation and to considerably reduce the computer time. The cut-off energy was 10 keV for electrons and photons. To obtain the dose rate distributions of the source in an unbounded liquid water phantom, the source was immersed at the center of a cube phantom of 100 cm3. The liquid water density was 0.998 g/cm3, and photon histories of up to 1010 were used to obtain the results with a standard deviation of less than 0.5% (k = 1). The obtained dose rate constant for the BEBIG 60Co source was 1.108±0.001 cGyh-1U-1, which is consistent with the values in the literature. The radial dose functions were compared with the values of the consensus data set in the literature, and they are consistent with the published data for this energy range."
https://openalex.org/W2186614693,"We develop here a multi-agent model of the creation of knowledge (scientific progress or technological evolution) within a community of researchers devoted to such endeavors. In the proposed model, agents learn in a physical-technological landscape, and weight is attached to both individual search and social influence. We find that the combination of these two forces together with random experimentation can account for both i) marginal change, that is, periods of normal science or refinements on the performance of a given technology (and in which the community stays in the neighborhood of the current paradigm); and ii) radical change, which takes the form of scientific paradigm shifts (or discontinuities in the structure of performance of a technology) that is observed as a swift migration of the knowledge community towards the new and superior paradigm. The efficiency of the search process is heavily dependent on the weight that agents posit on social influence. The occurrence of a paradigm shift becomes more likely when each member of the community attaches a small but positive weight to the experience of his/her peers. For this parameter region, nevertheless, a conservative force is exerted by the representatives of the current paradigm. However, social influence is not strong enough to seriously hamper individual discovery, and can act so as to empower successful individual pioneers who have conquered the new and superior paradigm."
https://openalex.org/W2196318995,"This study examined changes in prefrontal oxy-Hb levels measured by NIRS (Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) during a facial-emotion recognition task in healthy adults, testing a mediational/moderational model of these variables. Fifty-three healthy adults (male = 35, female = 18) aged between 22 to 37 years old (mean age = 24.05 years old) provided saliva samples, completed a EMBU questionnaire (Swedish acronym for Egna Minnen Beträffande Uppfostran [My memories of upbringing]), and participated in a facial-emotion recognition task during NIRS recording. There was a main effect of maternal rejection on RoxH (right frontal activation during an ambiguous task), and a gene × environment (G × E) interaction on RoxH, suggesting that individuals who carry the SL or LL genotype and who endorse greater perceived maternal rejection show less right frontal activation than SL/LL carriers with lower perceived maternal rejection. Finally, perceived parenting style played a mediating role in right frontal activation via the 5-HTTLPR genotype. Early-perceived parenting might influence neural activity in an uncertain situation i.e. rating ambiguous faces among individuals with certain genotypes. This preliminary study makes a small contribution to the mapping of an influence of gene and behaviour on the neural system. More such attempts should be made in order to clarify the links."
