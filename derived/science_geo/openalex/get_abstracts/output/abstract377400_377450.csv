https://openalex.org/W2009983971,"We have observed that the erythrocytes of man, mouse, fowl and other animals are agglutinated by saline suspensions of Hœmophilus pertussis, parapertussis and bronchisepticus, and also by filtrates and supernates of casein digest broth cultures of these organisms. The effect is neutralized by human and animal immune sera. A characteristic rise and fall in anti-hæmagglutinin titre occurs in the sera of children during the course of whooping cough. The protective power of sera, given parenterally, against lethal intranasal doses of H. pertussis in mice is closely correlated with their anti-hæmagglutinin titres, but not with their content of bacterial agglutinin or antitoxin."

https://openalex.org/W1999458340,"MOULTING in Rhodnius is initiated by a hormone secreted in the dorsum of the brain, and the premature metamorphosis of the young stages is prevented by a second hormone, the juvenile hormone secreted by the corpus allatum1–3. This conception of growth regulation in insects has proved applicable to Orthoptera4–7, Lepidoptera8–10 and Coleoptera11. In the Diptera, on the other hand, the composite ‘ring gland’;appears actively to induce metamorphosis, as though it were secreting a metamorphosis-promoting hormone12."

https://openalex.org/W2089937832,"AS is well known, the eastern Mediterranean has been far less biologically explored than the western. It was therefore a very welcome occasion to spend several months (1943) in the Island of Rhodes (Aegean Sea) and carry out there a series of researches, the main result of which has been to add a number of species to those previously found and recorded. Knowledge of Aegean animals was first improved by E. Forbes about a century ago. In 1926 a group of Italian zoologists investigated the shores of Rhodes and neighbouring islands ; other scattered data are to be found in various scientific papers, such as those concerning the famous Thor expedition. New and careful investigations are desirable for both an exact understanding of geographical distribution, variations and migrations of Mediterranean species and for ascertaining the spreading of those which have immigrated from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal : it is certain that some of them have reached the Aegean Sea, following the main current along the coasts of Syria and Asia Minor."

https://openalex.org/W2047221198,"IN a recent discussion1 of the nature of the C/D-ring union in the natural Å""strogenic hormones (+)-œstrone and (+)-equilenin, I suggested that the stereochemical correspondence of these compounds was not beyond all doubt. It has since come to my notice that satisfactory evidence of such correspondence does, in fact, already exist in the literature. Because this evidence appears generally to have escaped recognition, it seems desirable to direct attention to it, and it is briefly summarized hereunder."

https://openalex.org/W69579699,"Heretofore attempts to obtain synthesis of urea from ammonia (and carbon dioxide) in cell-free extracts have been unsuccessful. We have found the reaction to proceed in guinea pig liver homogenate. The following is the reaction mixture which has given the highest yields obtained so far: L-ornithine (0.00075 M), ammonia (0.0025 M), L-glutamate (0.01 M), oxalacetate (0.005 M), ATP (0.00025 M), and 0.33 gm. of homogenized liver in a final volume of 3.5 ml. The following are typical increases in urea over the blank observed in 1 hour, in micrograms: ornithine + ammonia 0, glutamate + oxalacetate 0, glutamate + oxalacetate + ornithine 49, glutamate + oxalacetate + ammonia 105, glutamate + oxalacetate + ornithine + ammonia 317, glutamate + ocalacetate + ornithine + ammonia (without ATP) 150."

https://openalex.org/W2016133550,"THE constitution and properties of pectic substances have been intensively studied1. Pectins, when reacting with the bifunctional formaldehyde under acidic conditions, have been found to form three-dimensional networks. This process takes place much more slowly than the corresponding reaction with polysaccharides containing primary hydroxyl groups (for example, lichenin). An accelerated reaction of pectic substances with formaldehyde may be obtained by using the monoglycol ester of pectic acid (I) instead of the natural methyl ester. The glycol ester is easily produced2 by treating pectic acid with ethylene oxide. A greater reactivity with formaldehyde, even under neutral conditions, would be expected upon the introduction of primary amino-groups into the pectic acid molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2072536610,"The suggestion recently made in these columns by Hawking1, that the drug paludrine is not itself an antimalarial agent but is converted into an active compound in vivo, opens up a wide field for speculation and research. No indication has yet been obtained as to the nature of this transformation product; but one of the more obvious hypotheses as to the fate of paludrine in the body appears to be excluded by an investigation which we have lately completed."
https://openalex.org/W2076170959,"The agar-plate or the cylinder-plate method of testing the effectiveness of antiseptics and antibiotics is now a well-known laboratory technique; and it is the basis of quantitative estimations of penicillin and of other antiseptics. There is little doubt that the degree of ‘zoning’ obtained is an excellent criterion of a good chemotherapeutic agent, and Fleming1 considers that this test should be so applied. However, recent experiences in my laboratory indicate that this test is not necessarily a good criterion for cation-active antiseptics of the class of quaternary ammonium salts, such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (‘Cetavlon’) and cetyl pyridinium ohloride (‘Ceepryn’)."

These authors visualized the olefin-electron acceptor (X) complex as a resonance hybrid involving the structures I, II and III:"

But whereas succinic acid was always obtained in a yield of 5 per cent, the yield of citric acid varied; it amounted to 10 per cent only when they used barium acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2005282094,"THE establishment of the Anti-Locust Research Centre at the British Museum (Natural History) marks an important step in solving problems of locust control. One of the main functions of that organisation has been the assembling and recording of reports on the breeding and migrations of locusts in Africa and Western Asia. No fewer than 7,986 reports have been received from the Governments of the territories in these areas up to the end of 1945. The collation and sifting of the data thus acquired entails a large amount of detailed work, which as ultimately incorporated in the publications of the Anti-Locust Centre. These latter are planned in two series. First, memoirs of quarto size adapted for the publication of detailed charts, etc., devoted to biogeographical and bioclimatic papers; secondly, bulletins intended for the publication of papers on all other aspects of locust and grasshopper research and control. Up to date, two memoirs have appeared and a third is in the press. The first of the bulletins is also in the press."
