https://openalex.org/W1969509501,"Proteins of the mammalian TRP (transient receptor potential) family form a heterogenous group of cation channels important for cellular Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis. Here we present the full-length sequence of TRPM3, a member of the melastatin-like subfamily (TRPM) of TRP channels. TRPM3 expression was found in human kidney and brain. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with TRPM3 showed a constitutive Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry. Whole-cell patch clamp experiments confirmed the spontaneous activity of TRPM3 and revealed permeability ratios PCa/PNa of 1.57 and PNa/PCs of 0.75. In cell-attached patches, spontaneous inward and outward currents were observed. At negative membrane potentials and in the presence of either 140 mm Cs+, 140 mm Na+, or 100 mm Ca2+ in the pipette solution, the single channel conductance levels were 133, 83, and 65 pS, respectively. The Ca2+ entry in TRPM3-expressing HEK293 cells increased during treatment with hypotonic extracellular solution. The reduction of extracellular osmolarity was accompanied by cell swelling, suggesting volume-regulated activity of TRPM3. From its function and expression in human kidney, we propose a role of TRPM3 in renal Ca2+ homeostasis.

They comprise a diverse group of ion channels that have been associated with a variety of cellular functions. According to structural and sequence similarities between individual TRP proteins, three subfamilies are distinguished: the classic TRPC, the vanilloid-like TRPV, and the melastatin-like TRPM subfamilies (1Harteneck C.

Nearly all members of the first two subfamilies have been characterized as Ca2+-permeable channels, playing an important role in cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and/or signaling. Whereas the functional characterization of TRPM proteins is much more incomplete, recent studies implicate a particular structural and functional diversity within this group. The eight known members of the TRPM subfamily can be subdivided into four groups according to their amino acid identity (3Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strübing C. Nat. Rev.

Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). These subgroups are formed by the following pairs: TRPM1 (melastatin) and TRPM3 (KIAA1616), TRPM2 (TRPC7 or LTRPC2) and TRPM8 (Trp-p8), TRPM4 and TRPM5 (MTR1), and TRPM6 (ChaK2) and TRPM7 (TRP-PLIK or ChaK1). The first member of the TRPM subfamily that was functionally characterized was TRPM7 (5Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). It is a Ca2+- and Mg2+-permeable channel, inhibited by intracellular Mg2+ and ATP (6Runnels L.W.

Physiol. 2002; 539: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The inactivation of TRPM7 is coupled to the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (8Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the TRP family, TRPM7 and TRPM6 have C-terminal regions with sequence similarity to the atypical kinase family, the alpha-kinase family (9Ryazanov A.G. Ward M.D. Mendola C.E. Pavur K.S. Dorovkov M.V. Wiedmann M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Parmer T.G. Prostko C.R. Germino F.J. Hait W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4884-4889Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of functional data, TRPM6 has been associated with Mg2+ transport, because mutations in TRPM6 cause a disorder with a defect in intestinal magnesium absorption (10Schlingmann K.P.

TRPM2 and TRPM8 have been shown to function as Ca2+-permeable channels activated in the presence of intracellular ADP-ribose (12Perraud A.L. Fleig A. Dunn C.A. Bagley L.A. Launay P. Schmitz C.

Expression of TRPM4 induced spontaneous Ca2+ entry in HEK293 cells (17Xu X.Z. Moebius F. Gill D.L. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10692-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, a second TRPM4 form (TRPM4b) that includes additional 174 amino acids at the N-terminal end was characterized as a Ca2+-activated channel specific for monovalent cations (18Launay P. Fleig A. Perraud A.L. Scharenberg A.M. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Cell. 2002; 109: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). TRPM5 expression was recently found in taste receptor cells, and its heterologous expression revealed that it is activated by depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (19Perez C.A. Huang L. Rong M. Kozak J.A. Preuss A.K. Zhang H. Max M. Margolskee R.F. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Melastatin (TRPM1), the founding member of the TRPM subfamily, was first detected in melanoma tumor cell lines, and its down-regulation was correlated with the potential for melanoma metastasis (20Duncan L.M.

It was, therefore, suggested to be a tumor-suppressor protein (20Duncan L.M. Deeds J. Hunter J. Shao J. Holmgren L.M. Woolf E.A. Tepper R.I. Shyjan A.W.

Oncol. 2001; 19: 568-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Heterologously expressed melastatin was shown to induce Ca2+ entry, and the channel appeared to be regulated by a cytoplasmic isoform (17Xu X.Z. Moebius F. Gill D.L. Montell C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10692-10697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular structure and expression pattern of TRPM3, the closest relative to melastatin. Functional studies on TRPM3-transfected HEK293 cells revealed Ca2+ entry and cation currents activated by reduction of extracellular osmolarity. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Determination—The whole sequence of EST AA745664 from human kidney (American Type Culture collection, Rockville, MD) was determined and used to select synthetic oligonucleotides as primers for nested RACE reactions, which were always used in combination with the adaptor primers AP1 and AP2 of the human fetal brain and kidney Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). In a first round of nested 3′-RACE reactions, we were able to amplify a 3.4-kb DNA fragment using NSKR125 and NSKR126 (Table I). The fragment was subcloned in the TOPOpCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). For determination of the 5′-end, NSKR159 and NSKR160 (see Table I) were used in nested RACE reactions to amplify a 2.2-kb fragment. In a second round of 3′-RACE reactions, NSKR125 and NSKR161 (see Table I) were able to amplify fragments of 2.0 kb containing the 3′-untranslated regions and poly(A) stretches. The fragments of TRPM3 were subsequently subcloned to result in TRPM3 with an open reading frame of 1325 amino acid residues. The sequence data have been submitted to the GenBank™ data base under accession number AJ505026.Table ISequences of synthetic oligonucleotides usedNSKR1255′-CATCATACCCAGCACCAAAGACCCCCATAG-3′NSKR1265′-CCTGGGGGCCTGCAGAACTTTGAACT-3′NSKR1595′-CATGGAAAGGGAAGGAGTGGTTGAT-3′NSKR1605′-ATATCATCCTCCATTCCCAGCAGTTTCA-3′NSKR1615′-GCAGAAGAACCAGAGAAGCCCACAAAG-3′NSKR3045′-TTATACTGAATAAAGAGGATGCTCTGCAG-3′NSKR3055′-TACTGAATAAAGAGGATGCTCTGCAGGG-3′NSKR3305′-CACCATGCCAGAGCCGTGGGGGACGGTT-3′NSKRT7345′-TTGGGGCCGAAGAGGTTGTGGTA-3′NSKRT7355′-CAAAGCCATGTATGTGCGAGTATC-3′ Open table in a new tab A plasmid construct coding for the entire open reading frame was generated by subsequent subcloning of the three fragments. For subcloning in the expression vector TOPOpcDNA3.1/V5 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), the plasmids were linearized by digestion with BamHI. After isolation of the linearized plasmid DNA, the full coding sequence of TRPM3 was amplified by using NSKR330/304 (see Table I) to result in expression of wild-type TRPM3. For expression as fusion protein with C-terminal V5-antibody epitope and His6 tag or GFP, we used oligonucleotides eliminating the endogenous stop codon NSKR330/NSKR305 (see Table I) for amplification. The PCR was performed under the following conditions. An initial denaturation (94 °C for 2 min) was followed by seven PCR cycles (94 °C for 30 s; 68 °C for 300 s) and a final extension step (72 °C for 7 min). The PCR reaction mixture contained 30 pm of each primer, 0.5 μg of template DNA, 200 μm of each dNTP, and 2.6 units of polymerase-enzyme mixture (Expand HF, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). For expression as YFP fusion protein, the coding sequence of YFP was subcloned in-frame by using NotI and AvrII restriction sites. DNA for transient transfection was prepared using anion exchange columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All cDNA inserts of PCR reactions were sequenced on both strands using ABI Prism BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kits and an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Subsequent analysis of sequence data was performed with the Lasergene software package (Lasergene, Madison, WI). Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 100 units ml–1 penicillin, 100 μg ml–1 streptomycin under 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 85-mm dishes onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1.5–2 μg of DNA and 5 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) in 95 μl of Opti-MEM medium vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) 2 days later. Fluorescence measurements and electrophysiological studies were carried out 2–3 days after transfection. Northern Blot and RT-PCR—Northern blot hybridization was performed as described previously (23Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Briefly, DNA fragments (0.65-, 0.8-, 0.9-, and 1.4-kb fragments after digestion of TRPM3 in pCR2.1 with Bsp120I, XbaI, and XhoI) were radiolabeled according to a standard random-priming procedure using [α-32P]dATP in parallel reactions; unincorporated nucleotides were removed. Total RNA was extracted from various mouse tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) according to the standard protocol. For Northern blot hybridization, 10 μg of total RNA per lane was loaded on a denaturing formamide/formaldehyde-agarose gel. After electrophoresis, RNA was transferred on a charged nylon membrane (Tropilon Plus, Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) by capillary transfer. RNA was fixed on the membrane surface by UV light and by heating in an incubator at 80 °C for 2 h. The blots, mouse multiple tissue Northern and human multiple tissue Northern (12-lane (tissues), Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), were hybridized with a mixture of all labeling reactions. Hybridization and washing steps were performed with Ultrahyb hybridization mix (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK) according to the standard protocol. Post-hybridization wash steps were performed at 55 °C beginning with 2× SSC and 0.1% (W/V) SDS and ending up with 0.2× SSC plus 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The blots were exposed for 7–14 days with an intensifying screen on Kodak X-Omat AR films. RT-PCR analysis of human tissues was performed using multiple cDNA panels I and II (Clontech) as template and the oligonucleotides NSKRT734/735 (see Table I) in a standard PCR reaction. Products were separated in a 1% agarose gel, and the DNA/ethidium bromide-dependent fluorescence was documented using a video camera system. Western Blot—For generation of polyclonal rabbit antisera, we analyzed the delineated protein sequence and selected a synthetic peptide with probability to be immunogenic. The synthetic peptide from position 807 to 821 (CQEKEAEEPEKPTKE) was synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine for coupling to KLH. Following coupling three rabbits were immunized. Antiserum from day 90 was tested. The whole antiserum was isolated at day 100, and the specific IgG fraction was isolated by affinity column purification (Pineda Antikörper-Service, Berlin, Germany). Human membrane extracts (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) and membrane fractions of bovine and mouse tissues and transfected cells were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The proteins were transferred on nitrocellulose membranes, and the TRPM3 protein was detected by incubating the membrane with antibody solution at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the membranes were washed with TBST buffer, and the bound antibody was detected using an ECL Advance Western Blotting Detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Fluorescence Measurements—[Ca2+]i measurements in single cells were carried out using the fluorescence indicator fura-2 in combination with a monochromator-based imaging system (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany) attached to an inverted microscope (Axiovert 100, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). HEK293 cells were loaded with 4 μm fura-2-AM (Fura-2/AM, Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, The Netherlands) supplemented with 0.01% Pluronic F127 for 60 min at 37 °C in a standard solution containing 138 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH). Coverslips were then washed in this buffer for 20 min and mounted in a perfusion chamber on the microscope stage. Osmolarity effects were studied in a solution with 88 mm instead of 138 mm NaCl containing 0, 100, and 200 mm mannitol resulting in osmolarities of 200, 300, and 400 mosmol liter–1, respectively. The osmolarity of the solutions was measured using a freezing point depression osmometer (Roebling, Berlin, Germany). For [Ca2+]i measurements, fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm. After correction for the individual background fluorescence, the fluorescence ratio F340/F380 was calculated. Fluorescence quenching by Mn2+ entry was studied using the fura-2 isosbestic excitation wavelength at 360 nm, and the emitted light was monitored using the same filter system as for [Ca2+]i measurements. In all experiments, transfected cells were identified by their YFP- or GFP-fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 480 nm. The relative cell volume was spectroscopically determined using two-dimensional fura-2 fluorescence images at the isosbestic wavelength (23Strotmann R. Harteneck C. Nunnenmacher K. Schultz G. Plant T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The integral fluorescence intensity of an area that contained the whole cell at all times was divided by the integral fluorescence of a spot within the cell. This fluorescence ratio is reciprocal to the cytosolic fura-2 concentration and thus reflects the cell volume. The confocal images of transfected cells were acquired with a laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a krypton/argon ion laser. Patch Clamp Measurements and Data Analysis—Membrane currents were measured in the whole-cell and cell-attached configuration of the patch clamp technique. Currents were recorded using an EPC-7 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), subsequently low pass-filtered at 1 kHz, digitized with a sampling rate of 5 or 10 kHz, and analyzed using pCLAMP software (version 7.0, Axon Instruments, Burlingame, CA). The pipette resistance varied between 2 and 5 MΩ. Whole-cell currents were elicited by voltage ramps from –100 mV to +100 mV (400-ms duration) applied every 5 s from a holding potential of 0 mV. Pipettes for whole-cell recordings were filled with a solution composed of 130 mm CsCH3O3S, 10 mm CsCl, 2 or 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH). For Na+-free conditions, Na+ was replaced with 140 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG+). Relative cation permeabilities were calculated by Equations 1 and 2,PNa/PCs=([Cs+]o/[Na+]o)exp(ΔErevF/RT)(Eq. 1) andPCa/PM=([M+]o/4[Ca2+]o)exp(ΔErevF/RT)[1+exp(Erev,CaF/RT)](Eq. 2) where Erev is the reversal potential of whole-cell currents measured in the divalent cation-free, Na+-containing bath solution (Erev,Na), the divalent cation-free, Cs+-containing solution (Erev,Cs), and the solution containing 20 mm Ca2+ (Erev,Ca). ΔErev is a change in the reversal potential (Erev,Na – Erev,Cs or Erev,Ca – Erev,M), M+ is either Cs+ or Na+, F is the Faraday constant, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. The ion concentrations were corrected for the respective activity coefficients (0.76 for 140 mm NaCl, 0.73 for 140 mm CsCl, and 0.66 for 20 mm CaCl2). To test the effects of hypotonic solution, cells were initially bathed in a solution containing 80 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, and 100 mm mannitol (pH 7.4 with NaOH); 100 mm mannitol was then removed to reduce osmolarity from 300 to 200 mosmol liter–1. In some experiments 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB, RBI, Deisenhofen, Germany) was applied during hypotonic treatment. Whole-cell currents were measured using the perforated-patch technique with amphotericin B (0.25 mg ml–1, Sigma). Single-channel currents were continuously measured at different pipette potentials. The corresponding membrane potentials for cell-attached patches were calculated by Equation 3,Vm=Vc−Vp+VL(Eq. 3) where Vm is the membrane potential, Vc is the resting potential of the cell, and VL is the junction potential. To obtain Vc = 0 mV, the bath solution contained 140 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4). Pipettes were either filled with 130 mm CsCH3O3S (cesium methane sulfonate), 10 mm CsCl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) or with 130 mm sodium gluconate, 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) or with 100 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Values for VL were calculated using pCLAMP software (version 7.0). Single-channel amplitudes at different Vm values were calculated from current traces of 2–4 s using amplitude histograms fitted to Gaussian functions. All pooled data from fluorescence measurements are given as means ± S.E. from n experiments containing 20–40 cells, unless otherwise noted. All pooled data from patch-clamp experiments are expressed as means ± S.E. from n cells. Primary Structure of TRPM3—Searching the EST subset of the GenBank™ data base, we found an expressed sequence tag (EST) from human kidney (EST AA745664) with sequence homologies to the N-terminal sequence of melastatin. We determined the sequence of the entire clone (798 bp) obtained from ATCC. On the basis of this sequence, we were able to clone the complete cDNA of the protein, which showed homologies to the previously identified mouse EST AA038185 (1Harteneck C. Plant T.D. Schultz G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 159-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 4Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Cell. 2002; 108: 595-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) and was, therefore, designated TRPM3 (Fig. 1A). The putative open reading frame starts at nucleotide 245 of the consensus sequence (Fig. 1B). The in-frame stop codon (nucleotide 176) in the upstream 5′-untranslated region argues for the translational start at position 245, although the score for prediction of the start methionine is low. The presence of the motif, (W/F)IX3–(F/L/I)XK(R/K)EC(V/I/S)X12–24CXCG, downstream at position 63 confirmed the cloning of the entire cDNA of TRPM3 with the correct start position (Fig. 1C). This motif is present in nearly all mammalian (except for TRPM5), Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans members of the TRPM subfamily. Tissue Distribution of TRPM3—Tissue distribution of TRPM3 was studied by Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses. Different multiple tissue Northern blots were hybridized and resulted in signals from mRNAs in human kidney (Fig. 2A). The Northern blot results were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. We found signals in cDNA of kidney, brain, ovaria, and pancreas (Fig. 2B). Northern blot analysis of multiple mouse tissues resulted in strong signals in brain, whereas in kidney no signal could be detected (Fig. 2C). For detection of TRPM3 protein, an antibody was generated by immunization of rabbits. The antisera were tested using lysates and membrane fractions of transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A). The expressed protein detected by antibody showed an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa, which is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass (157 kDa). The specificity of the antibody reaction was verified by incubating parallel lanes with the antibody in the presence of the peptide used for immunization (Fig. 3A). The antiserum was subsequently used to detect TRPM3 expression in extracts from bovine, human, and mouse tissues (Fig. 3B). In mouse brain, proteins with molecular masses of around 130 and 220 kDa were detected by using the antiserum (Fig. 3B). In mouse kidney, TRPM3 was not detectable, whereas in bovine kidney, human brain, and human kidney, a clear signal with an apparent molecular mass of about 160 kDa was detected (Fig. 3B). Although the TRPM3 cDNA codes for the protein expressed in bovine kidney, human brain, and human kidney, the proteins detected in mouse brain are probably products from alternatively spliced transcripts. In summary, TRPM3 is expressed in bovine and human kidney but not in mouse kidney. TRPM3 Mediates Constitutive Ca2+Entry—To study cellular distribution and function of heterologously expressed TRPM3, the cDNA was subcloned as wild-type and fusion-protein constructs in eukaryotic expression vectors. Subcellular distribution of TRPM3 in transiently transfected cells was investigated by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Prominent signals of TRPM3 were detected in the intracellular compartments of the cells, but slight signals were also seen in regions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). Functional studies were performed in fura-2-loaded and transiently transfected or in co-transfected HEK293 cells. In fluorescence quench experiments using 1 mm Mn2+, a rapid reduction of fluorescence intensity was observed in TRPM3-transfected cells but not in YFP-transfected control cells (Fig. 4B). To verify the specificity of this TRPM3-mediated Mn2+ entry, we used substances known to block cation channels of the TRP family. Gd3+ (100 μM, Fig. 4B) and La3+ (100 μM, data not shown) completely inhibited the Mn2+ influx, whereas SK&F-96365 (100 μm, data not shown) did not significantly block the quench. The cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, was increased in TRPM3-transfected but not in YFP-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 4C). This elevated [Ca2+]i level was evoked by Ca2+ entry, indicated by the decrease in fluorescence ratios in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 4C). Permeation Properties of TRPM3—In accordance with the spontaneous Ca2+ and Mn2+ entry, whole-cell patch clamp experiments revealed constitutively activated cation currents in TRPM3-expressing cells. The exchange of Na+ for the large cation NMDG+ in the bath solution resulted in a clear decrease in inward currents in TRPM3-transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A). The NMDG+-sensitive inward current was –8.2 ± 1.3 pA picofarad–1 at –80 mV (n = 58) using a Ca2+-free, Mg2+-containing (2 or 5 mm) pipette solution. In YFP-transfected control cells, the NMDG+-sensitive current was –1.8 ± 0.3 pA picofarad–1 at –80 mV (n = 13). The current-voltage relationship of the current of spontaneously active TRPM3 showed no clear rectification and a reversal potential (Erev) of –7.6 ± 0.6 mV (n = 58). Application of the cation channel blocker Gd3+ (100 μm) completely suppressed inward and outward currents (n = 4, Fig. 5A), whereas external SK&F-96365 (100 μm) had no significant effect (n = 3, Fig. 5A). To study the selectivity of the current of constitutively active TRPM3 in transfected cells, we replaced the standard extracellular solution containing Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ by solutions containing only one of the cations NMDG+, Na+, Cs+, Ca2+, or Mg2+. In Na+-containing bath solution the removal of divalent cations induced a slight increase of inward (Fig. 5B) and outward currents (not shown). The reversal potentials, however, were similar with –9.0 ± 1.5 mV (n = 4) and –9.8 ± 2.2 mV (n = 4) in the presence and absence of divalent cations, respectively. Under divalent-free conditions, the exchange of Na+ for Cs+ further increased inward currents and shifted Erev to –3.1 ± 2.5 mV (n = 4). In experiments with 20 mm Ca2+, we added 100 mM NMDG+ to the bath solution to obtain normal osmolarity. The measured Erev was –24.8 ± 3.1 mV (n = 4) under these conditions. With 100 mm external Ca2+, hyperpolarizing potentials evoked inward currents of nearly similar amplitude and noise as observed in the presence of 140 mm Na+ or Cs+ (Fig. 5, B and C). With 100 mm Mg2+, inward current amplitudes were smaller than in standard bath solution but significantly increased compared with the NMDG+ solution (Fig. 5D), indicating permeability for Mg2+. From the shifts of Erev during subsequent application of Na+ (140 mm), Cs+ (140 mm), and Ca2+ (20 mM) we calculated permeability ratios according to Equations 1 and 2. Permeability ratios of constitutively active TRPM3 were 1.14 ± 0.10 for PCa/PCs, 0.74 ± 0.09 for PNa/PCs, and 1.57 ± 0.31 for PCa/PNa. Single Channel Properties of TRPM3—Because whole-cell recordings revealed spontaneous mono- and divalent cation currents, we performed cell-attached patch experiments in TRPM3-transfected, unstimulated HEK293 cells.

Local extracellular acidification is carried out by vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) localized in the plasma membrane. We have shown that a3, one of the four subunit a isoforms (a1, a2, a3, and a4), is a component of the plasma membrane V-ATPase (Toyomura, T., Oka, T., Yamaguchi, C., Wada, Y., and Futai, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8760–8765). To establish the unique localization of V-ATPase, we have used a murine macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, that can differentiate into multinuclear osteoclast-like cells on stimulation with RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand). The V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes, whereas those with the a1 and a2 isoforms were localized to organelles other than lysosomes. After stimulation, the V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was immunochemically colocalized with lysosome marker lamp2 and was detected in acidic organelles. These organelles were also colocalized with microtubules, and the signals of lamp2 and a3 were dispersed by nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizer. In RAW-derived osteoclasts cultured on mouse skull pieces, the a3 isoform was transported to the plasma membrane facing the bone and accumulated inside podosome rings. These findings indicate that V-ATPases with the a3 isoform localized in late endosomes/lysosomes are transported to the cell periphery during differentiation and finally assembled into the plasma membrane of mature osteoclasts.

Although the important role of V-ATPase in bone resorption has been established, much less is known about the mechanism of targeting the enzyme during osteoclast differentiation. Meanwhile, V-ATPases function in the membranes of ubiquitous organelles, including secretory vesicles, endosomes, the Golgi apparatus, and lysosomes. Thus, it is of interest to know how V-ATPases are localized to the various membranes and whether or not they have different compositions depending on the cellular location (7Futai M. Oka T. Moriyama Y. Wada Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

On the other hand, a single gene for the c subunit has been detected in mammals (18Hanada H. Hasebe M. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was localized to the osteoclast plasma membrane (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of the Atp6i gene for mouse a3 causes severe osteopetrosis due to the loss of osteoclast-mediated acidification of resorption lacunae (29Li Y.-P. Chen W. Liang Y. Li E. Stachenko P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). A spontaneous mouse osteopetrotic mutation (30Nakamura N. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) has been mapped to the same gene (31Scimeca J.-C. Franchi A. Trojani C. Parrinello H. Grosgeorge J. Robert C. Jaillon O. Poirier C. Gaudray P. Carle G.F. Bone. 2000; 26: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These results established that the a3 isoform is an essential subunit for the osteoclast plasma membrane V-ATPase. However, the a3 isoform is expressed in all tissues so far examined, and it is not restricted to osteoclasts (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, the subcellular localization of a3 in other cell types remains to be determined. In this study, we found unexpectedly that the V-ATPase with the a3 isoforms was localized to late endosomes and lysosomes in NIH3T3 and RAW 264.7 cells. RAW 264.7 can form multinuclear cells when cultured with the extracellular domain of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand) (32Huang L. Xu J. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The differentiated cells express osteoclast markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, calcitonin receptor, c-src, and cathepsin K. After RANKL stimulation, the a3 isoform together with lysosome markers are localized on dot-like organelles associated with the filamentous structures of microtubules extending to the cell surface and reside on the plasma membrane of mature multinuclear osteoclast-like cells. These findings suggest that lysosomal V-ATPase is targeted to the ruffled border upon osteoclast differentiation. Materials—Antibodies against subunit a isoforms were prepared and affinity-purified as described previously (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

The monoclonal antibodies (rat clone GL2A7) for lamp2 (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2), α-tubulin (rat clone YOL 1/34), GM130 (mouse clone 35), and syntaxin 4 were purchased from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Harlan Sera-Lab, BD Transduction Laboratories, and Synaptic Systems, respectively. Other materials are also from commercial sources: fluorescein isothiocyanate- and indocarbocyanine Cy3.18-conjugated secondary antibodies, Jackson ImmunoResearch; Alexa Fluor™ 488-labeled anti-rabbit goat IgG, rhodamine phalloidin, Alexa Fluor™ 647-labeled phalloidin, and LysoTracker, Molecular Probes; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), minimal essential medium (MEM), and fetal bovine serum, Invitrogen; recombinant extracellular domain of human RANKL (sRANKL), Peprotech EC; mouse recombinant M-CSF, R&D Systems; and nocodazole and cytochalasin D, Sigma. Cell Culture—RAW 264.7 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2. For osteoclast differentiation, RAW 264.7 cells were harvested with a 0.05% trypsin solution containing 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) and then starved for 5 h in serum-free MEM containing non-essential amino acids. They were then cultured on a plastic dish for 7 days in MEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, 100 ng/ml sRANKL, 10 ng/ml M-CSF, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and then maintained by replacing the medium every 2 days. Histochemical staining for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was performed as described previously (33Yamashita T. Asano K. Takahashi N. Akatsu T. Udagawa N. Sasaki T. Martin T.J. Suda T. Cell Physiol. 1990; 145: 587-595Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Histology—To stain the osteoclasts attached to the bone surface, mice (C57Bl/6J male; age, 6 weeks) were anesthetized and then perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Their tibiae and femora were dissected out and immersed in the same solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the tibiae were decalcified with an EDTA solution (9% EDTA-2Na-2H2O, 10% EDTA-4Na-4H2O) at 4 °C for 1 week. They were successively infiltrated with 30% sucrose in PBS, embedded in OCT compound (Miles), and stored frozen. They were then sectioned at 6-μm thickness, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and stained with hematoxylin. Sections were stained immunochemically as described previously (34Nakamura H. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Ozawa H. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1994; 57: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunochemistry—Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed at room temperature for 25 min in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 2% paraformaldehyde. After rinsing with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine, and incubation for 15 min at room temperature in PBS containing 0.4% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2% normal goat serum, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies. They were washed with the same solution, and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. They were then washed again and finally mounted on a glass slide with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For observation of acidic organelles, osteoclast-like cells were incubated with DMEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum, 1 μm LysoTracker Red DND-99 for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2. They were then fixed at room temperature for 60 min with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 2% normal goat serum in PBS. The cells were incubated with anti-a3 polyclonal antibody at room temperature for 60 min and then stained with the Alexa 488-labeled antibodies for 60 min. They were finally mounted with PermaFluor (Shandon). Fluorescence images were acquired with a confocal microscope, LSM 510 (Carl Zeiss). Electron Microscopy—The pre-embedding silver enhancement immunogold method was used as described previously (35Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Sato A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Osteoclast-like cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h (36Mimori-Kiyosue Y. Shiina N. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Cryosections (∼1 μm) were reacted with 10 μg/ml anti-a3 antibodies overnight, followed by incubation with colloidal gold-conjugated antibodies. For double-labeling immunoelectron microscopy, sections were reacted with anti-a3 and -lamp2 antibodies. They were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG gold conjugate (5-nm diameter) and goat anti-rat IgG gold conjugate (10-nm diameter), followed by observation under an Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. Presence of V-ATPase with the a3 Isoform in the Plasma Membrane and the Vicinity of Osteoclasts—The V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was localized to the plasma membrane and the periphery of mouse osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To confirm this previous observation, we studied sections of tibiae and femora immunohistochemically. As shown in Fig. 1, osteoclasts were identified after staining with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP). The V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was found in the plasma membrane region of the TRAP-positive cells facing the bone matrix. Localization of the a3 Isoform in Late Endosomes and Lysosomes of RAW 264.7 Cells before Differentiation—We addressed the question of whether the V-ATPase localization is similar in the progenitor RAW 264.7 cells, which can differentiate into osteoclast-like multinuclear cells (32Huang L. Xu J. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In contrast to those in osteoclasts, anti-a3 antibodies stained dot-like structures around the nuclei, and no positive staining was observed on the plasma membrane or its vicinity (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the a3 signal was colocalized with lamp2, a marker for late endosomes and lysosomes (37Granger B.L. Green S.A. Gabel C.A. Howe C.L. Mellman I. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12036-12043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Uthayakumar S. Granger B.L. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1995; 41: 405-420PubMed Google Scholar). Essentially the same observation was made for mouse NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that V-ATPase with the a3 isoform is localized to the late endosomes and lysosomes in the osteoclast progenitor cells and fibroblasts. Signals of both the a1 and a2 were not superimposed with that of lamp2 as shown in Fig. 2C, indicating that V-ATPases with a1 or a2 are not present in lysosome/late endosomes. The signal for GM130, a cis-Golgi marker (39Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), was not superimposed with those of a3 (Fig. 2D). GM130 overlapped with a1 and a2, suggesting that these isoforms are localized to the Golgi complex in RAW 264.7 cells. Furthermore, a1 was also localized to organelles other than lysosomes/late endosomes or the Golgi apparatus. Localization of V-ATPase with the a3 Isoform in Lysosomes during Differentiation—It became of interest to determine the cellular localization or organization of lysosomes during differentiation, because the a3 isoform was localized to lysosomes before stimulation (Fig. 2B). RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF, and osteoclast-like multinuclear cells were identified by staining for TRAP (Fig. 3A). The number of TRAP-positive cells reached a plateau level after stimulation for 7 days (data not shown). The localization of the dot-like organelles stained with anti-a3 antibodies dramatically changed upon differentiation: at 1–3 days after stimulation, the organelles were distributed evenly in the cytoplasm; at 5 days, they were found around the nuclei and on the filaments extending to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3B). After 7 days, a3 mostly localized to the plasma membrane and its close vicinity, similar to the osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We found that lamp2 was also localized on the filaments extending to the plasma membrane at 5 days after stimulation and mostly on the plasma membrane and its close vicinity after 7 days (Fig. 3B). The lamp2 staining was merged with that of a3 in x-y and x-z sections (Fig. 3, B and C, respectively). Consistent with the immunofluorescence staining, electron microscopic observation revealed that both the a3 isoform and lamp2 were localized to lysosome-like multivesicular bodies (Fig. 4). Interestingly, lamp2 signal was observed on both limiting membranes and vesicular or tubular structures inside the multivesicular bodies (10-nm gold particles in Fig. 4, arrowheads); however, the a3 localization was restricted to the limiting membranes (5-nm particles in Fig. 4, arrows). LysoTracker, an indicator of luminal acidic organelles, could stain the lumens of the organelles (about 1-μm diameter) carrying a3 (Fig. 5). The signals of LysoTracker decreased during the permeabilization of immunofluorescence, even though we still observed a significant fraction of a3 staining positively for LysoTracker. A lack of LysoTracker staining in the presence of bafilomycin A1, a V-ATPase inhibitor, confirmed that the organellar lumens were acidified by V-ATPase. These results suggest that V-ATPase with the a3 isoform in lysosomes/late endosomes membranes was transported to the periphery, and part of it was fused with the plasma membrane to yield the cell surface proton pump. Judging from the results of immunoblotting, the amount of a3 increased about 5-fold upon stimulation together with V1 subunit A, indicating that V-ATPase with the a3 isoform had increased (Fig. 6). Based on this observation, the amount applied to the gel was standardized as to the culture, where a significant population had differentiated into osteoclast-like cells. On the other hand, no increase in a1 or a2 was detected, consistent with previous results for osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The a4 isoform, which is expressed specifically in kidney (26Oka T. Murata Y. Namba M. Yoshimizu T.

Microtubule Association of Organelles Carrying V-ATPase with the a3 Isoform—The dot-like organelles stained with anti-a3 and lamp2 antibodies (a3/lamp2-positive compartments) were colocalized with microtubules but not with actin filaments in osteoclast-like cells (Fig. 7A), as shown previously for osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Nocodazole and cytochalasin D are known to depolymerize microtubules (40De Brabander M. De May J. Joniau M. Geuens G. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1997; 1: 177-183Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Scheel J. Matteoni R. Ludwig T. Bernard L. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 711-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and actin filaments (42Aldridge D.C. Turner W.B. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1969; 22: 170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), respectively. No filamentous structures with the a3 isoform and lamp2 were visible after nocodazole treatment, although the signals for the two proteins showed similar localizations (Fig. 7B). The a3 localization was not affected by cytochalasin D, suggesting that actin filaments were not involved in the filamentous distribution of a3. These results suggest that the a3/lamp2-positive compartments are localized on the microtubules extending to the plasma membrane. Polarized Distribution of V-ATPase with the a3 Isoform— Although V-ATPases with the a3 isoform were found in the plasma membrane region (Fig. 3), the results for vertical (x-z) sections indicate that it is localized to the region facing both the medium and the culture dish surface (Fig. 3C). It is also noteworthy that the multinuclear cells did not form podosomes (Fig. 7A), a discrete ring of actin filaments found in osteoclasts (43Akisaka T. Yoshida H. Inoue S. Shimizu K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2001; 16: 1248-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 44Väänänen H.K. Horton M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2729-2732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The even distribution may be a result of the cells being cultured on a plastic surface. Thus, we transferred RAW 264.7 cells stimulated for 6 days to a bone surface and cultured them for an additional day. The osteoclast-like cells on the bone showed a significantly polarized distribution of the a3 isoform surrounded by actin rings, a structure similar to podosomes (Fig. 8A). A lateral section (x-z) also indicated that podosomes are formed on the bone side, and a3 is concentrated inside the ring (Fig. 8B). The a3 was localized to the plasma membrane, and it was near the bone surface, whereas syntaxin 4, a plasma membrane marker, merged with a3 in areas facing the bone surface but did not merge in membranes facing the medium. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed that the a3 signal was highly concentrated in the cell periphery and plasma membrane facing the bone matrix (Fig. 9, A and B). All these results indicate that V-ATPase with the a3 isoform is targeted from multivesicular compartments (Fig. 9B, upper right inset) to the ruffled border membrane forming resorption lacunae.Fig. 9Electron microscopic localization of the a3 isoform in osteoclast-like cells cultured on a bone surface.A, localization of the a3 isoform in osteoclast-like cells is shown immunochemically by electron dense silver-enhanced gold particles (see arrows, for example).

Both intra- and extracellular acidic environments are established by V-ATPase localized in organellar and plasma membranes, respectively (7Futai M. Oka T. Moriyama Y. Wada Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp.

Thus, obvious questions are whether V-ATPases in various locations have exactly the same subunit composition and how the specific V-ATPases are transported to final destinations. These issues are closely related to the mechanism of membrane trafficking or organellar biogenesis (7Futai M. Oka T. Moriyama Y. Wada Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We were interested in membrane-embedded VO subunits, because their unique isoforms may play significant roles in the localization of V-ATPases to specific membranes. The four mouse VO subunit a isoforms, a1, a2, and a3 are expressed ubiquitously (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). However, a3 was found specifically in the plasma membrane and near the osteoclasts derived from bone marrow cells (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol.

Consistent with this localization, a3 mutations caused osteopetrosis in humans and mouse (29Li Y.-P. Chen W. Liang Y. Li E. Stachenko P. Nat.

Recently, we also identified isoforms of mouse V1 and VO subunits C, G, E, and d (47Imai-Senga Y. Sun-Wada G.-H. Wada Y. Futai M.

The isoforms of the V1 sector may also be involved in determining the activity and/or localization of V-ATPase within the cell through interaction with a specific a isoform. In this regard, all isoforms except B1 and B2 for the B subunit are localized in the stalk region connecting the catalytic domain with the VO sector (7Futai M. Oka T. Moriyama Y. Wada Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Futai M. Oka T. Sun-Wada G.-H. Moriyama Y. Kanazawa H. Wada Y. J. Exp.

Rev. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts differentiate from hematopoietic progenitor cells through interaction of their plasma membrane receptor (RANK) with RANKL of osteoblasts (1Ash P. Loutit J.F. Townsend K.M. Nature. 1980; 283: 669-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 2Scheven B.A. Visser J.W. Nijweide P.J. Nature. 1986; 321: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 51Udagawa N.

A murine macrophage line, RAW 264.7, can differentiate into osteoclast-like multinuclear cells, when cultured with the extracellular domain of RANKL (32Huang L. Xu J. Wood D.J. Zheng M.H. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 52Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The a3 is localized to the lysosomes/late endosomes of unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells, whereas most of the a2 and a1 isoforms were in the Golgi complex and not colocalized with a late endosome/lysosome marker lamp2. The kidney-specific a4 subunit was not found in RAW 264.7 cells. These results indicate that no a subunit and, accordingly, no V-ATPase were localized to the plasma membrane before stimulation. Upon differentiation into multinuclear cells, a3 was found on the surface of inside-acidic organelles stained with lamp2, which were on the filamentous microtubules extending to the plasma membrane. These results indicate that V-ATPase with the a3 isoform is localized to the lysosomes/late endosomes of progenitor cells and that these organelles are transported near the plasma membrane of osteoclast-like cells. Electron microscopy confirmed that the V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was finally targeted to the plasma membrane. Thus, an exciting possibility is that lysosomes or late endosomes, transported to the vicinity of the cell surface, directly fuse with the plasma membrane. Our results indicate that such a fusion event is essential for the formation of a functional proton pump on the cell surface. The molecular machinery underlying the lysosome fusion with plasma membrane in osteoclasts remains unclear. Several genetic diseases, which are characterized by varying degrees of hypopigmentation, prolonged bleeding, and immunological deficiency, are the result of impairment of lysosome exocytosis in cell types, including cytotoxic T cells and melanocytes (53Andrews N.W. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 316-321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 54Blott E.J. Griffiths G.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence concerning any defects in bone metabolism in patients and mutant mice. The assembly of a3 into V-ATPase was confirmed by immunoprecipitation: anti-a3 antibodies precipitated subunit A of the V1 sector and the c subunit of VO from the solubilized fraction (with 2% octylglucoside) or RAW 264.7 membranes. 2T. Toyomura, Y. Murata, A. Yamamoto, T. Oka, G.-H. Sun-Wada, Y. Wada, and M. Futai, unpublished data. Furthermore, the amounts of the a3 isoform and the A subunit of V1 increased to the same degree after differentiation, suggesting that expression of V-ATPase with the a3 isoform was induced during osteoclast differentiation. Our results showed the re-routing of the lysosome pool of V-ATPase to the plasma membrane, but it is still difficult to rule out the possibility that newly synthesized enzyme with the a3 isoform was deposited to plasma membrane. We have tried to monitor the a3-green fluorescent protein fusion protein transferring to the plasma membrane in living cells. However, the green fluorescent protein-tagged protein as well as other fusions, including hemagglutinin-tagged and myctagged a isoforms appeared to be degraded readily or did not exhibit the corresponding localization as the authentic protein. In this regard, there is still no information on any amino acid determinants specific to a3 isoform that may mediate proper targeting. In eukaryotic cells, organellar transport to a destination is accomplished by microtubule-associated motor proteins, including kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein (55Abu-amer Y. Ross F.P. Schlesinger P. Tondravi M.M. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). It has been shown that c-src, which plays a pivotal role in osteoclast differentiation, is co-localized with intracellular microtubules through a direct interaction with tubulin (56Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is colocalized with microtubules in osteoclasts (25Toyomura T. Oka T. Yamaguchi C. Wada Y. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8760-8765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 56Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar), suggesting that the organelles containing molecules involved in bone resorption are transported to the bone-apposed cell surface through microtubules. Consistently, the depolymerization of microtubules disturbed the a3 localization with the filamentous structures. It has also been shown that the B subunit of V-ATPase contains a filamentous actinbinding site (57Holliday L.S. Lu M. Lee B.S. Nelson R.D. Solivan S. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32331-32337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The luminal acidic organelles (vesicles) delivered to the vicinity of the plasma membrane may be concentrated to form an active resorption domain through an interaction with microfilaments. It should be emphasized finally that lysosomes/late endosomes and, eventually, V-ATPases change their intracellular localization during the expression of differentiated functions. For changes in the final destination of lysosomal V-ATPase, the subunit a3 isoform should play a pertinent role, because other isoforms (a1 and a2) are not assembled into the plasma membrane. Thus, apparently ubiquitous lysosomal V-ATPase becomes a specific plasma membrane pump in highly differentiated osteoclasts. We thank Dr. I. Taguchi (Research Institute, Tanabe Seiyaku Co., Ltd.) for his help with the RAW 264.7 cell culture, A. Fukuyama for expert technical assistance on histochemistry, and S. Shimamura and M.

https://openalex.org/W2014868351,"Growth factor regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to a wide variety of cellular processes. The cortical actin-associated protein, cortactin, regulates the formation of dynamic actin networks via the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex and hence is a key mediator of such responses. In order to reveal novel roles for this versatile protein, we used a proteomics-based approach to isolate cortactin-interacting proteins. This identified several proteins, including CD2-associated protein (CD2AP), as targets for the cortactin Src homology 3 domain. Co-immunoprecipitation of CD2AP with cortactin occurred at endogenous expression levels, was transiently induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment, and required the cortactin Src homology 3 domain. The CD2AP-binding site for cortactin mapped to the second of three proline-rich regions. Because CD2AP is closely related to Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85), which regulates growth factor receptor down-regulation via complex formation with Cbl and endophilin, we investigated whether the CD2AP-cortactin complex performs a similar function. EGF treatment of cells led to transient association of Cbl and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with a constitutive CD2AP-endophilin complex. Cortactin was recruited into this complex with slightly delayed kinetics compared with Cbl and the EGFR. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the EGFR, CD2AP, and cortactin co-localized in regions of EGF-induced membrane ruffles. Therefore, by binding both CD2AP and the Arp2/3 complex, cortactin links receptor endocytosis to actin polymerization, which may facilitate the trafficking of internalized growth factor receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1996790111,"Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) belongs to a family of evolutionary conserved innate immune recognition molecules and recognizes double-stranded RNA, a molecular pattern associated with viral infections. Earlier studies suggested a differential expression pattern in men and mice; the molecular basis for this observation, however, was unknown.

Despite the overall unrelatedness of TLR3 promoter sequences, mRNA expression of both TLR3 orthologues was induced by interferons, particularly by interferon (IFN)-β. The basal and IFN-β-induced activation of promoters from both species largely depended on similar interferon regulatory factor (IRF) elements, which constitutively bound IRF-2 and recruited IRF-1 after stimulation.

We also show that LPS specifically up-regulates TLR3 expression in murine cells through the induction of autocrine/paracrine IFN-β.

Upon ligation they activate conserved intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules or the secretion of cytokines, responses that are necessary to combat infection in vertebrates (as reviewed in Refs. 1Aderem A.

Two recent studies have implicated Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in the recognition of double-stranded RNA, a molecular pattern associated with viral infections (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar, 4Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor with a chemical analog of double-stranded RNA, polyriboinosine-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), was shown to induce the activation of NF-κB and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) in human and murine TLR3 expressing cell types (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar, 4Matsumoto M. Kikkawa S. Kohase M. Miyake K. Seya T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). TLR3-deficient (TLR3–/–) mice exhibited reduced responses to poly(I:C) and reduced production of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6, interleukin-12, and tumor necrosis factor (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). A contribution of TLR3 to antiviral immunity, however, remains to be demonstrated. Interestingly, different TLR3 expression patterns have been reported in mice and humans, a phenomenon also observed for at least three other TLR family members: TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 (for a review, see Ref. 5Rehli M. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 375-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Within the human hematopoietic compartment, TLR3 mRNA expression has been shown to be restricted to dendritic cells (6Muzio M. Bosisio D. Polentarutti N. D'amico G. Stoppacciaro A. Mancinelli R. van't Veer C. Penton-Rol G. Ruco L.P. Allavena P. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5998-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), as was the cytokine response to poly(I:C) stimulation (7Kadowaki N. Ho S. Antonenko S. Malefyt R.W. Kastelein R.A. Bazan F. Liu Y.J. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 863-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). In mice, TLR3 is also strongly expressed in macrophages and its expression is markedly induced upon LPS stimulation, a feature that has not been observed in human cells (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). Since the differential expression pattern of TLR3 could have a significant impact on TLR3 function in humans and mice, we have further characterized TLR3 expression and analyzed gene regulatory mechanisms acting in both species. We found that the non-coding regions, including 5′-exons and proximal promoter regions of TLR3 genes are different in both species, as is the cell type specificity and the regulated expression upon stimulation with LPS. However, despite the overall unrelatedness of promoter sequences, both species share the up-regulation of TLR3 by IFN-β. Evolutionary conservation of TLR3 induction by interferons indicate that this regulatory feature may be important during viral infections in both species.

THP-1 cells were differentiated for 48–72h by adding PMA (10–8m) to the culture medium. To prepare peritoneal macrophages, mice (12 weeks of age) were injected intraperitoneally with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate medium (Difco). Three days later, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from the peritoneal cavity by washing with phosphate-buffered saline solution (Invitrogen). Cells were cultured in endotoxin-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and after 1 h medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells. Adherent monolayer cells were used as peritoneal macrophages. Peritoneal macrophages were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were cultured as described previously (14Ross I.L. Yue X. Ostrowski M.C. Hume D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6662-6669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RNA Preparation, Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from different cell types by the guanidine thiocyanate/acid phenol method (15Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using Superscript II MMLV-RT (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on a Lightcycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using the Quantitect kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used were: TLR3 (specific for human and mouse): sense, 5′-TCA CTT GCT CAT TCT CCC TT-3′; antisense, 5′-GAC CTC TCC ATT CCT GGC-3′. TLR2 (mouse): sense, 5′-TTC TGA GTG TAG GGG CTT C-3′; antisense, 5′-CCC AGA AGC ATC ACA TGA C-3′. β-Actin: sense, 5′-TGA CGG GGT TCA CCC ACA CTG TGC CCA TCT A-3′; antisense, 5′-CTA GAA GCA TTT GTG GTG GAC GAT GGA GGG-3′. Cycling parameters were: denaturation 95 °C, 15 min, amplification 95 °C, 15 s, 56 °C, 20 s, 72 °C, 25 s, for 45 cycles. The product size was initially controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis, and melting curves were analyzed to control for specificity of the PCR reactions. TLR data were normalized for expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin. The relative units were calculated from a standard curve plotting three different concentrations of log dilutions against the PCR cycle number (CP) at which the measured fluorescence intensity reaches a fixed value. The amplification efficiency E was calculated from the slope of the standard curve by the formula: E = 10–1/slope. ETLR3 was in the range of 1.78 to 2.14, and ETLR2 ranged from 1.76 to 1.84. For each sample, data from three independent analyses were averaged. RNA Ligase-mediated RACE-PCR—Ten μg of total RNA from monocyte-derived dendritic cell or LPS-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived macrophages were used for cDNA synthesis with the First-Choice™ RLM-RACE kit (Ambion). The following TLR3-specific primers were used to amplify full-length 5′-cDNA fragments of human or murine TLR3, respectively: hTLR3-OUT (5′-TGT GAA GTT GGC GGC TGG-3′) and hTLR3-IN (5′-CAG GTG GCT GCA GTC AGC AAC-3′), mTLR3-OUT (5′-GTC AGC TAC GTT GTA TCT CAC AGT G-3′) and mTLR3-IN1 (5′-ACA CCC TTT CAT GAT TCA GCC-3′) or mTLR3-IN2 (5′-ACA CCA GAA TCC ATA GGG AC-3′). PCR products from both species were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (TOPO Cloning kit, Invitrogen), and inserts from at least 10 individual plasmid-containing bacterial colonies derived from each cell type were re-amplified by PCR and directly sequenced (performed by Geneart, Regensburg, Germany). Plasmid Construction and Purification—A 588-bp genomic fragment of the human TLR3-promoter was amplified from human genomic DNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the primers hTLR3p_S (5′-GAT CAG ATC TCA GCT TTG CCA TGT TTG G-3′) and hTLR3p_AS (5′-ACG TGA ATT CTG TTG GAT GAC TGC TAG CCT TTC C-3′). Primer sequences were derived from a BAC clone containing the TLR3 sequence deposited in the GenBank™ data base (GenBank™ accession number AC104070). The obtained PCR fragment was subcloned into pGL3-B (Promega) and sequenced. Deletions of the hTLR3(–588) construct were generated by PCR using primers hTLR3(–400) _S (5′-GTC AAG ATC TTC GCA TGA GTC TAG CAG-3′) or hTLR3(–200) _S (5′-GAC TAG ATC TGG TTT GAA ACG CCT CTC TG-3′) together with the vector-specific primer GL2 (Invitrogen). Two fragments of the proximal murine TLR3 promoter (including intron 1 and exon 2) were similarly amplified from mouse genomic DNA using the primers mtlr3-F1_S (5′-TGC AAG ATC TGA GTG TAG CCA TGA GCC AGG-3′) and mtlr3-F2_AS (5′-CAT CAA GCT TCT ATC TTC TTT TGG TGC GCG-3′). Deletions of the resulting mtlr3(–1368) construct were generated using the internal SacI (–966) or EcoR I (–429) restriction sites. Mutations of putative transcription factor binding sites were carried out by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using the following primers: human ISRE/IRF element: htlr3IRF-M_S (5′-TTT TCA AGC TTT ACA CGC ACT TTC GAG AGT G-3′) and htlr3IRF-M_AS (5′-CAC TCT CGA AAG TGC GTG TAA AGC TTG AAA A-3′); human STAT element: htlr3STAT-M_S (5′-CCT TTG CCC TTC TTA TGA TGC ACC AAA CAT AA-3′) and htlr3STAT-M_AS (5′-TTA TGT TTG GTG CAT CAT AAG AAG GGC AAA GG-3′); murine exon 2 ISRE/IRF element: mtlr3IRFi-M_S (5′-CTC TCT CAA CTT AAG ACG CAC TTT CAG GCT GA-3′) and mtlr3IRFi-M_AS (5′-TCA GCC TGA AAG TGC GTC TTA AGT TGA GAG AG-3′); murine intron 1 ISRE/IRF element: mtlr3IRFo-M_S (5′-GGT AAG TGA ATG GCA CGC ACT TTG TTT AGA CA-3′) and mtlr3IRFo-M_AS (5′-TGT CTA AAC AAA GTG CGT GCC ATT CAC TTA CC-3′). DNA sequence analysis was performed by Geneart. For transfections, plasmids were isolated and purified using the Endofree Plasmid Kit from Qiagen. Transient and Stable DNA Transfections—THP-1 cells were transfected in duplicates using DEAE-dextran as described previously (16Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated THP-1 cells were cultivated for 48 h before harvesting. In stimulation experiments, THP-1 cells were treated with PMA the day after transfection and harvested after 72 h. Cell lysates were assayed for firefly and renilla luciferase activity using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) on a Sirius luminometer (Berthold). Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized against renilla luciferase activity. RAW264.7 cells were transfected using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions as described previously (17Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Duplicate transfections were harvested after 24 h and cell lysates assayed for firefly luciferase activity using the luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity of individual transfections was normalized against protein concentration measured using a BCA assay (Sigma). For stimulation experiments, RAW264.7 cells were transfected in 10 cm tissue culture dishes as above using linearized reporter constructs (10 μg) as well as a plasmid (pcDNA3) carrying the neomycin resistance gene (5 μg). Cells were selected for stable integration of plasmid DNA by culturing cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 350 μg/ml G418 for 2–3 weeks. Stably transfected cells were pooled, expanded, and 7.5 × 105 cells/ml were seeded into six-well plates in duplicates the day before stimulation. Cells were harvested at the indicated timepoints, and cell lysates were assayed as described above. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (16Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the STAT or IRF elements were labeled with [α-32P]dGTP using Klenow DNA polymerase. Sequences of IRF motifs are indicated in the figures; sequences of other oligonucleotides were: human STAT/GAS element, human STAT motif (5′-CTT TGC CCT TCT TGG AAT GCA CCA-3′) and mutated human STAT motif (5′-CTT TGC CCT TCT Tat gAT GCA CCA-3′); consensus GAS-element: 5′-CTT TGC ATT TCC CCG AAA TCA CCA-3′. The binding reaction contained 2.5 μg of nuclear extract protein, 0.5 μg of poly-(dI-dC), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, and 20 nmol of probe DNA in a final volume of 10 μl. Antisera used in supershift analyses were added after 15 min, and samples were loaded onto polyacrylamide gels after incubating at room temperature for a total of 30 min. Buffers and running conditions used have been described previously (16Rehli M. Poltorak A. Schwarzfischer L. Krause S.W. Andreesen R. Beutler B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9773-9781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed in 5% acetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. TLR3 mRNA Expression in Murine and Human Mononuclear Phagocytes—Recently published data suggest a differential expression pattern of TLR3 in human and murine mononuclear cells (5Rehli M. Trends Immunol. 2002; 23: 375-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To directly compare the mRNA expression of TLR3 in human and murine cells, we designed PCR primers complementary to TLR3 sequences, which are identical in both species. Real-time PCR using various mononuclear cell types from both species confirmed the previously observed predominant expression of human TLR3 in “immature” myeloid dendritic cells (see Fig. 1). Highest TLR3 expression levels in mice, however, were detectable in macrophages, which expressed the highest TLR3 mRNA levels of all tested cell types. These results indicated that cell type-specific regulation of TLR3 might be different between the two species. Species-specific TLR3 Regulation in Response to LPS or IFNs—Previously published data indicated a differential, species-specific response in LPS-stimulated cells regarding TLR3 expression (3Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar, 6Muzio M. Bosisio D. Polentarutti N. D'amico G. Stoppacciaro A. Mancinelli R. van't Veer C.

J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Additionally, TLR3 expression in human macrophages had been shown to be markedly induced upon stimulation with IFN-α (19Miettinen M. Sareneva T. Julkunen I. Matikainen S. Genes Immun. 2001; 2: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To systematically compare the inducible expression patterns of TLR3 in both species, TLR3-expressing monocytic cells from both species were analyzed for TLR3 expression after stimulation with LPS, as well as type I or II interferons (IFN-β and IFN-γ, respectively), the latter being important mediators during viral infections. As shown in Fig. 2, all three stimuli induced TLR3 mRNA in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages after 4 h, with TLR3 being down-regulated to basal levels after 24 h. In the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line, again, all three stimuli up-regulated TLR3 mRNA at 4 h. In contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages, IFN-γ led to a further increase in TLR3 expression after 24 h in RAW264.7 cells. In human monocyte-derived cell types, a consistent up-regulation of TLR3 expression was only observed in the presence of IFN-β. Shown are two representative examples (out of four) for monocyte-derived dendritic cells from different donors. While expressing different basal levels of TLR3 mRNA, primary blood monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages up-regulated TLR3 in a comparable fashion in response to IFN-β (data not shown). The response to IFN-γ in human cells was variable depending on the donor. While the human monocytic cell lines MonoMac6 and THP-1 proved unresponsive under normal culture conditions, TLR3 mRNA was IFN-β-inducible in PMA-differentiated macrophage-like THP-1 cells (data not shown). In contrast to murine TLR3, we never observed a significant up-regulation of human TLR3 in response to LPS. Determination of Transcriptional Start Sites and Proximal Promoters—To further analyze the regulatory mechanisms of TLR3 expression in both species, we determined TLR3 transcriptional start sites by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) PCR using total RNA derived from LPS-stimulated murine BM-derived macrophages or human monocyte-derived dendritic cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Comparison of the obtained 5′-cDNA sequences and publicly available genomic sequences revealed the complete structures of the human and murine TLR3 genes (see Fig. 3). The translation start codon of human TLR3 is located in exon II, whereas the murine coding sequence begins in exon IV. Murine TLR3 mRNA can be initiated from two alternative promoter regions preceding exon I or exon II, respectively, the latter being predominantly utilized in LPS-stimulated BM-derived macrophages. While the nucleotide sequences around coding regions of human and murine TLR3 share a high degree of homology (75% identity), sequence comparison using the ClustalW algorithm did not reveal a significant level of homology (3–16% identical nucleotides) between the proximal promoter regions and 5′-untranslated regions of murine and human TLR3 genes. Computational analysis revealed a differential organization of the proximal promoter sequences from both species. Whereas the human gene contains a TATA-like element, the murine promoters are TATA-less and instead contain several putative binding sites for the myeloid and B-cell-specific transcription factor PU.1 (sequences and structures of the proximal promoter regions are shown in Fig. 3). To facilitate further analysis of mechanisms regulating the differential expression pattern of TLR3 in humans and mice, we cloned fragments of the 5′-proximal promoter regions of both TLR3 genes into a luciferase reporter plasmid. Transient transfection analysis was performed in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 to determine the basal activity of proximal TLR3 promoter regions. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 8, human TLR3 promoter constructs were weakly active in both cell lines. Constructs containing either both alternative murine promoters or the downstream promoter alone were strongly active in murine macrophages, but only weakly in the human monocytic cell line, suggesting that the proximal promoters display different activities in human and murine cell lines. TLR3 Promoter Elements and Signaling Molecules Involved in IFN Signaling—Initial transfection experiments indicated that the proximal TLR3 promoter regions from both species are responsive to IFN-β treatment in both human and murine cells. To determine cis-elements required for IFN-β-mediated induction of promoter activity, we mutated putative binding sites that could be involved in interferon-regulated gene responses, including two putative ISRE/IRF elements in the mouse promoter and an ISRE/IRF as well as a STAT element in the human promoter (see Fig. 4A). In human PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, wild-type TLR3 constructs of both species significantly responded to IFN-β after 24 h, while only a marginal induction of promoter activity was observed after 4 h. Mutation of the putative ISRE/IRF element in the human promoter abolished both basal and induced activity. Mutation of the nearby human STAT site reduced basal activity to ∼50% and also abrogated the IFN-β-induced activation (Fig. 4B). In murine RAW264.7 cells, promoters from both species were activated by IFN-β after 4 h. Induction of both promoters by IFN-γ was delayed as compared with IFN-β. Promoters were only weakly induced by LPS in transfection experiments performed in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4C). These results were similar to those obtained for endogenous TLR3 expression in RAW264.7 cells upon stimulation (see Fig. 2B). Mutation of the inner ISRE/IRF element drastically reduced the basal activity of the murine TLR3 promoter in RAW264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4D) and resulted in complete loss of IFN-β-induced up-regulation of promoter activity (Fig. 4E). Mutation of an upstream ISRE/IRF element had no effect on the basal and the IFN-β induction of the TLR3 promoter (Fig. 3, D and E). Above results suggest that despite the overall unrelatedness of TLR3 promoter structures in mouse and man, promoters of both species contain functionally important ISRE/IRF elements, which are similar in sequence and located close to the transcription start sites. To identify the nuclear factors binding these elements under basal and induced conditions, gel shift experiments were performed using nuclear extracts of IFN-β-treated and untreated human dendritic cells and murine RAW264.7 macrophages. As demonstrated by competition and supershift assays (shown in Fig. 5), IRF-2 constitutively bound the IRF motif of human and murine origin, whereas IRF-1 was recruited after stimulation in both human and murine cells. Antibodies against other IRF family members (IRF-3, -4, -7, -8, and -9) or STAT proteins (STAT1–6) did not change the observed band pattern in gel shift assays (data not shown), indicating that IRF-1 and IRF-2 are the major factors binding IRF sites in both species. In initial co-transfection studies, both IRF-1 and IRF-2 were able to transactivate the human promoter in HT-29 cells (data not shown). We also performed gel shift assays to identify the nuclear proteins binding to the human STAT motif. The STAT motif specifically competed with the binding of STAT1 to a known STAT1 (GAS) binding site, indicating that STAT1 may be able to bind this site. However, we were unable to detect binding of STAT1 directly to the human STAT motif in gel shift assays (data not shown). For the murine gene, the role of several interferon signaling components in IFN-β induced TLR3 up-regulation, including the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR1), STAT1, Tyk2, as well as IRF-1, was analyzed in either peritoneal macrophages or bone marrow-derived macrophages from knock-out mice lacking the respective genes. As shown in Fig. 6, up-regulation of TLR3 by IFN-β in peritoneal macrophages depends on IFNARI, but not on the Jak family member Tyk2. The induction of TLR3 in bone marrow-derived macrophages also depended on STAT1 as well as IRF-1, albeit to a lesser degree, indicating that other family members may compensate for IRF-1 deficiency.Fig. 5Binding of nuclear proteins to the proximal human and murine IRF sites.A, sequence alignment of consensus (cons.)

https://openalex.org/W2158754769,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation-selective channels are an emerging class of proteins that are involved in a variety of important biological functions including pain transduction, thermosensation, mechanoregulation, and vasorelaxation. Utilizing a bioinformatics approach, we have identified the full-length human TRPM3 (hTRPM3) as a member of the TRP family. The hTRPM3 gene is comprised of 24 exons and maps to human chromosome 9q-21.12. hTRPM3 is composed of 1555 amino acids and possesses the characteristic six-transmembrane domain of the TRP family. hTRPM3 is expressed primarily in kidney and, at lesser levels, in brain, testis, and spinal cord as demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting. In situ hybridization in human kidney demonstrated that hTRPM3 mRNA expression is predominantly found in the collecting tubular epithelium. Heterologous expression of hTRPM3 in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293) showed that hTRPM3 is localized to the cell membrane. hTRPM3-expressing cells exhibited Ca2+ concentration-dependent Ca2+ entry. Depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores by lowering extracellular Ca2+ concentration and treatment with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin or the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol further augmented hTRPM3-mediated Ca2+ entry. The nonselective Ca2+ channel blocker, lanthanide gadolinium (Gd3+), partially inhibited hTRPM3-mediated Ca2+ entry. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hTRPM3 mediates a Ca2+ entry pathway that apparently is distinct from the endogenous Ca2+ entry pathways present in HEK 293 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1980321222,"Although liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) is an important binding site for various hydrophobic ligands in hepatocytes, its <i>in vivo</i> significance is not understood. We have therefore created L-FABP null mice and report here their initial analysis, focusing on the impact of this mutation on hepatic fatty acid binding capacity, lipid composition, and expression of other lipid-binding proteins. Gel-filtered cytosol from L-FABP null liver lacked the main fatty acid binding peak in the fraction that normally comprises both L-FABP and sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2). The binding capacity for <i>cis</i>-parinaric acid was decreased >80% in this region. Molar ratios of cholesterol/cholesterol ester, cholesteryl ester/triglyceride, and cholesterol/phospholipid were 2- to 3-fold greater, reflecting up to 3-fold absolute increases in specific lipid classes in the order cholesterol > cholesterol esters > phospholipids. In contrast, the liver pool sizes of nonesterified fatty acids and triglycerides were not altered. However, hepatic deposition of a bolus of intravenously injected [<sup>14</sup>C]oleate was markedly reduced, showing altered lipid pool turnover. An increase of ∼75% of soluble SCP-2 but little or no change of other soluble (glutathione <i>S</i>-transferase, albumin) and membrane (fatty acid transport protein, CD36, aspartate aminotransferase, caveolin) fatty acid transporters was measured. These results (i) provide for the first time a quantitative assessment of the contribution of L-FABP to cytosolic fatty acid binding capacity, (ii) establish L-FABP as an important determinant of hepatic lipid composition and turnover, and (iii) suggest that SCP-2 contributes to the accumulation of cholesterol in L-FABP null liver."
https://openalex.org/W2014148669,"The plasma membrane contains ordered lipid domains, commonly called lipid rafts, enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and certain signaling proteins. Lipid rafts play a structural role in signal initiation by the high affinity receptor for IgE. Cross-linking of IgE-receptor complexes by antigen causes their coalescence with lipid rafts, where they are phosphorylated by the Src family tyrosine kinase, Lyn. To understand how lipid rafts participate in functional coupling between Lyn and FcϵRI, we investigated whether the lipid raft environment influences the specific activity of Lyn. We used differential detergent solubility and sucrose gradient fractionation to isolate Lyn from raft and nonraft regions of the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. We show that Lyn recovered from lipid rafts has a substantially higher specific activity than Lyn from nonraft environments. Furthermore, this higher specific activity correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation at the active site loop of the kinase domain. Based on these results, we propose that lipid rafts exclude a phosphatase that negatively regulates Lyn kinase activity by constitutive dephosphorylation of the kinase domain tyrosine residue of Lyn. In this model, cross-linking of FcϵRI promotes its proximity to active Lyn in a lipid raft environment.

Cross-linking of IgE-FcϵRI complexes on mast cells by multivalent antigens initiates a series of signaling events that culminate in the exocytosis of mediators of the allergic response. The earliest detectable biochemical event following receptor aggregation is phosphorylation of the ITAM sequences on FcϵRI β and γ subunits by Src family tyrosine kinases, primarily Lyn (1Kinet J.P.

In the transphosphorylation model proposed in these studies, Lyn can only phosphorylate an adjacent FcϵRI following aggregation of two or more receptors. Subsequent studies from the Metzger laboratory showed that the β subunit of FcϵRI is capable of weak interactions with Lyn in the absence of phosphorylation (5Vonakis B.M. Chen H. Haleem-Smith H.

Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, either the association of Lyn or FcϵRI or both with rafts is important for initiating this process. Previous studies that focused on the relatively low abundance of proteins in isolated lipid rafts suggested that localization of signaling proteins in rafts serves to concentrate them and thereby promote signaling (17Xavier R. Brennan T. Li Q. McCormack C. Seed B. Immunity. 1998; 8: 723-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 18Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, it is now clear that these ordered regions of the plasma membrane constitute a large percentage of its lipid and surface area (19Gidwani A. Holowka D. Baird B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12422-12429Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 20Maxfield F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To gain more insight about the mechanism by which lipid rafts facilitate functional coupling between cross-linked FcϵRI and Lyn, we investigated the role of membrane environment on the kinase activity of Lyn. We find that Lyn solubilized from RBL mast cells by Triton X-100 represents a subset of Lyn with reduced kinase activity, and this subset largely fractionates with nonraft proteins in sucrose gradients. Lyn isolated with lipid rafts has a substantially higher kinase activity than Lyn from nonraft fractions, and this increase in activity correlates with greater tyrosine phosphorylation of raft-associated Lyn in its kinase domain. Cross-linking of FcϵRI does not increase the overall kinase activity of Lyn in these cells but rather promotes functional coupling by causing co-compartmentalization of these receptors with the active form of Lyn in the raft environment. Differential Detergent Solubility—RBL-2H3 cells (21Barsumian E.L. Isersky C. Petrino M.G. Siraganian R.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) were suspended at 8–10 × 106 cells/ml in bovine serum albumin containing buffered saline solution (BSS (16Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 877-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar)) and lysed by mixing 1:1 (v/v) with a detergent solution for a final concentration of either 0.5% Triton X-100 or RIPA 1The abbreviations used are: RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; PNS, postnuclear supernatant; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. detergents (0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.05% SDS) in lysis buffer (11Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 10 min on ice and then clarified by microcentrifugation (14,800 × g) for 20 min at 4 °C to yield a postnuclear supernatant (PNS). In some experiments, half of the Triton X-100-lysed cells were loaded directly on a sucrose gradient, the other half were microcentrifuged for 20 min, and the PNS was loaded. The amount of Lyn solubilized by RIPA was determined by quantitative anti-Lyn Western blot data (see below) through comparisons of RIPA-lysed samples before and after clarification. The relative amount of Lyn solubilized in the Triton X-100 lysate was determined by comparing Lyn immunoprecipitation yields from RIPA PNS with Triton X-100 PNS. Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—RBL-2H3 cells were lysed at 3 × 107 cells/ml in 0.25% Triton X-100 in lysis buffer for 10 min on ice. The lysates were then brought to 40% sucrose by a 1:1 (v/v) dilution with an 80% sucrose stock solution, and 1 ml of this solution was applied to the bottom of an 11 × 60-mm centrifuge tube (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). 2 ml of 30% sucrose and then 1 ml of 5% sucrose were layered above the lysate. Samples were ultracentrifuged as previously described for 12–18 h at 250,000 × g (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation, samples were fractionated to obtain lipid raft and nonlipid raft fractions. These fractions were diluted 2-fold with lysis buffer containing RIPA for subsequent immunoprecipitation of Lyn. Lyn Immunoprecipitation and in Vitro Kinase Assay—Lyn was immunoprecipitated from 0.5–1 ml of detergent extracts by incubation with 2 μg anti-Lyn mouse monoclonal antibody H6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1–2 h on ice and then rotated for 45 min with 35 μl of ImmunoPure Immobilized Protein A (Pierce) at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer without detergent and then once with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm Na3VO4). After washing, Lyn immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays by adding 200 μl of kinase assay buffer containing either 1 mm ATP, no ATP, or 1 mm ATP and 100 μg of dephosphorylated α-casein (Sigma) as an exogenous substrate. Samples were then incubated at either 37 °C for samples without α-casein, or 30 °C for samples with α-casein, for 15 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 μlof5× nonreducing SDS sample buffer (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) followed immediately by boiling. Immunoblotting—Samples were separated by electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide SDS gels under nonreducing conditions, and then electrophoresed proteins were transferred to an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) with a Panther semidry electroblotter (Owl Separation Systems, Inc., Portsmouth, NH). Anti-phosphotyrosine blotting was performed using 0.1 μg/ml 4G10 mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Upstream Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) diluted in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of Tris-buffered saline solution (TBST) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl2, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and StabilZyme SELECT (SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN). Blots were then stripped by incubation with 0.2 m NaOH for 5–30 min and quenched with TBST. Anti-Lyn blotting was performed on the stripped blots using 0.2 μg/ml anti-Lyn rabbit polyclonal antibody 44 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a horseradish peroxidase-labeled antirabbit Ig secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences), both in a solution of 0.8% bovine serum albumin in TBST. All immunoblots were developed as previously described (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Lyn Basal Phosphorylation and Specific Activity— Western blots were scanned from film with an Epson Expression 1600 digital scanner (Epson, Long Beach, CA), and density was determined using UnScanit software (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT); intensities of multiple samples on a single blot were normalized to a single sample in each blot. Lyn basal phosphorylation is defined as the amount of phosphorylation on immunopurified Lyn after an in vitro kinase incubation in the absence of ATP. Lyn specific activity is defined as the amount of phosphorylation on immunopurified Lyn following an in vitro kinase assay incubation in the presence of ATP minus the basal phosphorylation of a parallel sample. Values were calculated by dividing the normalized intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation on Lyn from the 4G10 blot by the normalized intensity of Lyn from the reprobed anti-Lyn blot in the same lane from nonsaturated film following Western blotting. Alternatively, specific activity was determined as the intensity of phosphorylated α-casein following an in vitro kinase assay incubation in the presence of ATP and α-casein in the kinase assay buffer, divided by the amount of Lyn in the same lane. Phosphopeptide Mapping of Lyn—Lyn was immunopurified using 35 μl of anti-Lyn conjugated to agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1–2 × 108 cell equivalents of RBL-2H3 cells lysed in the RIPA detergent buffer as above. Some Lyn samples were subjected to autophosphorylation in the in vitro kinase assay prior to elution and mapping. Lyn was eluted from the anti-Lyn beads by incubation with 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 2.5. Next, the sample was dried using vacuum centrifugation (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and exchanged to 70% formic acid containing 100 mg/ml cyanogen bromide (CNBr) (ICN Biomedicals, Inc., Aurora, OH) to digest the protein overnight at room temperature in the dark. The following day, 500 μl of H2O was added to digests, and this mixture was then evaporated to dryness in the vacuum centrifuge. This wash step was repeated three more times, and dried samples were solubilized in 30–50 μl of 1× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mg/ml bromphenol blue). Half of the sample was run on a 16.5% acrylamide Tricine gel (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to an Immobilon PSQ membrane (Millipore Corp.) by semidry transfer. Membranes were subsequently blocked for 4 h with 4% bovine serum albumin in TBST and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10, washed, and detected by chemiluminescence as described above. Lyn Isolated from Triton X-100 Postnuclear Supernatants Has Reduced Specific Activity—Initial experiments compared the specific activity of Lyn isolated from RBL-2H3 cells lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 with that for Lyn isolated from cells lysed with RIPA detergents. Unstimulated RBL-2H3 cells were lysed in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors, and Lyn was immunoprecipitated from the PNS. Western blotting with anti-Lyn showed that 95 ± 1% of the total cellular Lyn was recovered from the RIPA PNS, whereas only 40 ± 9% of Lyn was recovered from the Triton X-100 PNS (Fig. 1A). The amount of protein solubilized in each PNS is approximately equal for Triton X-100 versus RIPA lysis. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. Additionally, equivalent amounts of uncross-linked FcϵRI were solubilized by these two detergent preparations as determined by fluorescent IgE quantitation in PNSs. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. By Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10, we determined both basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and in vitro kinase autophosphorylation of Lyn under conditions similar to those in a previous study from our laboratory (15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Blots were then stripped, and the amount of Lyn present in each sample was determined by anti-Lyn Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn from both Triton X-100- and RIPA-solubilized Lyn (Fig. 1C, white bars) is small compared with tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn following the incubation with ATP, although Lyn from RIPA PNS consistently has slightly higher levels of basal phosphorylation. The specific kinase activity for Lyn autophosphorylation (Fig. 1C, shaded bars) is 4.5-fold higher in Lyn recovered from RIPA PNS compared with Triton X-100 PNS. Thus, Lyn isolated following Triton X-100 solubilization represents a subset of total Lyn with relatively low specific activity that is less than 10% of the total cellular Lyn activity. To investigate further the effects of the two different lysis conditions on Lyn specific activity, we performed additional control experiments. To test whether RIPA enhances Lyn kinase activity, we washed Triton X-100-solubilized, immunoprecipitated Lyn with RIPA prior to the in vitro kinase reaction. We found no difference in kinase activity of Lyn with and without the RIPA wash, indicating no differential effects of detergents on Lyn kinase activity. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. Also, because of the large differences in Lyn recovery from RIPA and Triton X-100 PNS, we verified that results obtained were independent of the concentration of Lyn under the range of concentrations used for the in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 1C, inset). The Triton X-100 Postnuclear Supernatant Is Depleted of Raft-associated Lyn—The insolubility of a substantial percentage of cellular Lyn following RBL-2H3 lysis in 0.5% Triton X-100 led us to examine the distribution of solubilized Lyn in the Triton X-100 PNS by sucrose gradient analysis. Fig. 2 compares the distribution of this Lyn, obtained as PNS (Fig. 1A), with the distribution of Lyn from cells lysed in the same concentration of Triton X-100 but directly loaded onto a sucrose gradient without precentrifugation. The representative blots shown in Fig. 2 illustrate that the Triton X-100 PNS is significantly depleted of lipid raft-associated Lyn; 4% of the Lyn from the PNS fractionates in the lipid raft region of the gradient, whereas 45% of the total cellular Lyn is found in the raft fraction under these conditions. Similar results were observed for lysis in 1% Triton X-100, indicating that Lyn solubility is not limited by the amount of detergent under these conditions. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. As observed previously (25Holowka D. Sheets E.D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the alternatively spliced 53- and 56-kDa forms of Lyn are more highly resolved in the nonraft fractions in Fig. 2. These results, taken together, indicate that Triton X-100 lysis yields a PNS that is selectively depleted of lipid raft-associated Lyn. Raft-associated Lyn Has Enhanced Kinase Activity—The results of Fig. 2 suggest that the difference in specific activity between Lyn from Triton X-100 and RIPA PNSs could be due to different amounts of raft-associated Lyn. This interpretation is consistent with studies by Ilangumaran et al. (22Ilangumaran S. Arni S. van Echten-Deckert G. Borisch B. Hoessli D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 891-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Kabouridis et al. (23Kabouridis P.S. Janzen J. Magee A.L. Ley S.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 954-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) indicating that the Src family kinases Lck and Fyn are differentially regulated by their lipid environment. To investigate directly whether the lipid raft environment affects Lyn activity, we isolated Lyn from either lipid raft or nonraft fractions obtained from sucrose gradient separation of RBL cells lysed by Triton X-100. A high concentration of cells was used in these experiments to permit sufficient recovery of Lyn from gradient fractions for immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase analysis. The ratio of detergent to cells chosen is similar to that used in previous studies to preserve the interactions between cross-linked IgE-FcϵRI complexes and lipid rafts (11Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, uncross-linked IgE-FcϵRI was fully solubilized, fractionating with the nonlipid raft components, indicating complete plasma membrane lysis. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. The sucrose gradient distribution of Lyn is shown in Fig. 3A and is similar to that in Fig. 2 and in previous experiments carried out under these conditions (11Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4276-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Lipid raft-associated Lyn was recovered from the interface between the 5 and 30% sucrose layers (fraction 2; Fig. 2), and nonraft Lyn was recovered from the soluble lysate in the 40% sucrose fraction (fraction 5; Fig. 2). Both fractions were then diluted into RIPA buffer, and Lyn was immunoprecipitated and analyzed as in Fig. 1. Representative Western blots from these experiments are shown in Fig. 3B. Consistent with results in Fig. 1C, we find that Lyn isolated from lipid rafts has a 3.6-fold higher specific activity than Lyn isolated from nonraft fractions (Fig. 3C, shaded bars). Also, the levels of basal phosphorylation are 6-fold higher for Lyn from the detergent-resistant lipid raft environment compared with solubilized Lyn (Fig. 3C, open bars). Thus, lipid raft-associated Lyn has substantially more kinase activity than Lyn from a more disordered membrane environment in this autophosphorylation assay. Furthermore, this higher specific activity correlates with higher basal phosphorylation of Lyn. To test the validity of conclusions based on in vitro Lyn autophosphosphorylation, we performed in vitro kinase assays using dephosphorylated α-casein as an exogenous substrate. We first determined that dephosphorylated α-casein is specifically phosphorylated by Lyn as indicated by a lack of phosphorylation in mock immunoprecipitations done without the Lyn antibody. 2R. M. Young, D. Holowka, and B. Baird, unpublished results. Activity was detected by quantitative Western blot analysis of the α-casein band with anti-phosphotyrosine and calculated per amount of Lyn detected by reprobing the blot as for the autophosphorylation assay. A representative Western blot is shown in Fig. 4A, and Fig. 4B summarizes the relative specific activities for Lyn from lipid raft and nonraft fractions. Consistent with the autophosphorylation results obtained in Figs. 1 and 3, raft-associated Lyn has a 4.7-fold higher specific activity toward α-casein than nonraft-associated Lyn. Specific Activity of Lyn Does Not Increase in Stimulated Cells—In previous studies, the total Lyn kinase activity associated with FcϵRI was shown to increase following antigen stimulation, but the specific activity of receptor-associated Lyn toward an exogenous substrate was found to be unchanged (4Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To determine whether the specific activity of total cellular Lyn is altered by antigen stimulation, IgE-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with an optimal dose of antigen (0.9 μg/ml denitrophenylated-bovine serum albumin) for various times. Lyn was then immunoprecipitated from RIPA-lysed cells, and in vitro kinase activity was determined with α-casein as an exogenous substrate. The results are summarized in Table I. Consistent with previous results from Metzger and colleagues (4Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 24Torigoe C. Metzger H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4016-4025Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), there is little change in Lyn specific kinase activity following stimulation for 2 min at 37 °C. Interestingly, Lyn specific activity was found to decrease by 60% after 5 min of stimulation (Table I); this may be related to the decline in FcϵRI tyrosine phosphorylation observed at later times of antigen stimulation (25Holowka D. Sheets E.D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). These results indicate that FcϵRI cross-linking does not cause detectable activation of Lyn kinase per se. Rather, Lyn kinase activity in resting cells is sufficient for stimulated FcϵRI phosphorylation that results from cross-linking by antigen. We conclude that the increase in FcϵRI phosphorylation commonly observed after cross-linking results from changes in FcϵRI proximity to active Lyn.Table IAntigen-stimulated changes in Lyn kinase specific activityTime of stimulationRelative Lyn specific activityaDetermined for RIPA-solubilized Lyn using α-casein as in Fig. 4.min01.0020.94 ± 0.27bS.D.

Open table in a new tab Tyrosine 397 Phosphorylation Is the Predominant Detectable Site of Tyrosine Phosphorylation on Lyn from Unstimulated RBL Cells—Results summarized in Figs. 1, 3, and 4 indicate that the higher specific activity of Lyn isolated from a lipid raft environment correlates with higher basal tyrosine phosphorylation. This higher specific activity is preserved following solubilization of Lyn away from the ordered lipids of the raft membranes by RIPA. Thus, it is likely that a covalent modification of Lyn, such as phosphorylation, is responsible for the higher activity state. Lyn, like other Src family kinases, has two major sites of tyrosine phosphorylation that regulate activity: one in the active site at residue 397 (Lyn A notation) and a second at the C terminus at residue 508 (26Hibbs M.L. Dunn A.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 397-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Tyr397 has been reported to increase the specific activity of Lyn by 17-fold (27Sotirellis N. Johnson T.M. Hibbs M.L. Stanley I.J. Stanley E. Dunn A.R. Cheng H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29773-29780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory site, Tyr508, reduces Lyn activity, similar to other Src family members (28Honda Z. Suzuki T. Hirose N. Aihara M. Shimizu T. Nada S. Okada M. Ra C. Morita Y. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25753-25760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate the relative abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation at these sites both before and after the in vitro kinase assay, we performed CNBr peptide mapping. CNBr cleavage of Lyn is predicted to yield separate fragments containing the active site and C-terminal site tyrosines with sizes of 8.2 and 4.1 kDa, respectively (Fig. 5). For these experiments, RIPA-solubilized Lyn was immunoprecipitated and subjected to an in vitro kinase incubation, with or without ATP, as in previous experiments, followed by treatment with CNBr. As shown in Fig. 5, basal Lyn phosphorylation is readily detectable in an ∼8-kDa fragment, consistent with the size expected for the minimal peptide containing Tyr397. Much less is detected in the ∼4-kDa peptide that is the size of the C-terminal fragment, similar to previous results in B-cells (29Hata A. Sabe H. Kurosaki T. Takata M. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7306-7313Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After the in vitro kinase incubation with ATP, Lyn autophosphorylation is again preferentially found in the ∼8-kDa fragment, similar to trends observed in two previous studies (27Sotirellis N.

https://openalex.org/W1982377654,"The ability of plant mitochondrial uncoupling proteins to catalyze a significant proton conductance in situ is controversial. We have re-examined conditions that lead to uncoupling of mitochondria isolated from the tubers of potato (Solanum tuberosum). Specifically, we have investigated the effect of superoxide. In the absence of superoxide, linoleic acid stimulated a proton leak in mitochondria respiring NADH that was insensitive to GTP. However, when exogenous superoxide was generated by the addition of xanthine and xanthine oxidase, there was an additional linoleic acid-stimulated proton leak that was specifically inhibited by GTP. Under these conditions of assay (NADH as a respiratory substrate, in the presence of linoleic acid and xanthine/xanthine oxidase) there was a higher rate of proton conductance in mitochondria from transgenic potato tubers overexpressing the StUCP gene than those from wild type. The increased proton leak in the transgenic mitochondria was completely abolished by the addition of GTP. This suggests that superoxide and linoleic acid stimulate a proton leak in potato mitochondria that is related to the activity of uncoupling protein. Furthermore, it demonstrates that changes in the amount of StUCP can alter the rate of proton conductance of potato mitochondria."

We now demonstrate the transient induction of nuclear phospho-RelA (day 3) followed by persistent activation of phospho-Smad2 (days 3 and 7) in IEC from mucosal tissue sections of B. vulgatus-monoassociated rats, indicating that both NF-κB and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling are induced in vivo following bacterial colonization.

The inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 is mediated independently of B. vulgatus/LPS-induced IκBα, Akt, and RelA phosphorylation as well as NF-κB DNA binding activity. Moreover, the specific histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A blocked B. vulgatus/LPS-induced histone acetylation/phosphorylation (Lys-9/Ser-10) and reversed TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of IL-6 gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that B. vulgatus/LPS-induced RelA recruitment to the IL-6 promoter is inhibited by TGF-β1 treatment. Adenoviral delivery of Smad7 and dominant negative Smad3 (SmadΔ3) reversed the TGF-β1-mediated inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity and NF-κB recruitment to the IL-6 promoter. In addition, TGF-β1 and Ad5Smad3/4 prevent B. vulgatus/LPS-induced CBP/p300 and p65 nuclear co-association.

The key role for commensal luminal bacteria in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is supported by the compelling evidence that intestinal inflammation is dramatically reduced or absent in germ-free rodent models susceptible for the development of chronic experimental colitis (4Bhan A.K. Mizoguchi E. Smith R.N. Mizoguchi A. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 195-207Google Scholar, 5Blumberg R.S. Saubermann L.J. Strober W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 648-656Google Scholar, 6Elson C.O.

In addition, reconstitution studies of gnotobiotic HLA-B27 transgenic rats (8Rath H.C. Herfarth H.H. Ikeda J.S. Grenther W.B. Hamm T.E.J. Balish E. Taurog J.D. Hammer R.E. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 945-953Google Scholar, 9Rath H.C. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2969-2974Google Scholar) and carrageenan-induced colitis in guinea pigs (10Onderdonk A.B. Franklin M.L. Cisneros R.L. Infect. Immun. 1981; 32: 225-231Google Scholar) suggest that selected bacterial species such as B. vulgatus are particularly important to the induction of colitis in these models. Of note, these bacteria induced no colitis in wild type rats, documenting their non-pathogenic nature (8Rath H.C. Herfarth H.H. Ikeda J.S. Grenther W.B. Hamm T.E.J. Balish E. Taurog J.D. Hammer R.E. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 945-953Google Scholar, 9Rath H.C. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2969-2974Google Scholar). We hypothesize that commensal non-pathogenic bacteria-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity and gene expression is regulated by a complex network of anti-inflammatory molecules and regulatory immune cells that prevents chronic intestinal inflammation in a normal host. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of IEC hyporesponsiveness to constant bacterial exposure would reveal important regulatory elements involved in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. IEC must adapt to a constant and constitutively changing luminal environment by processing different biological information through multiple signaling cascades that target a defined set of genes, which then provide an adequate effector response (2Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Google Scholar). Importantly, these extracellular cytoplasmic signals must be integrated with the action of various nuclear signal processes controlling access of transcription factors to the regulatory region of gene promoters. In the case of NF-κB, this implies induction of a signaling cascade that leads to the release of the transcription factor from its cytoplasmic inhibitor IκB, shuttling of the transcription factor to the nucleus where it accumulates. Simultaneously, activation of nuclear signaling proteins permits access to gene promoter regions (11Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 297: 1824-1827Google Scholar). In the resting state, transcriptionally inactive chromatin is tightly wrapped around histone proteins that hinder DNA binding by transcriptional factors, providing an additional complex layer of gene regulation. Histone wrapping to DNA and consequently accessibility of transcription factors to gene promoter elements is regulated by post-translational modifying mechanisms, such as histone acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation. Signaling cascades responsible for the activation of transcription factors must act synchronously with the different pathways leading to chromatin unfolding in order to achieve coordinate gene expression. For example, signaling cascades that impact the levels of histone acetylation strongly influence chromatin remodeling and gene expression (11Horn P.J. Peterson C.L. Science. 2002; 297: 1824-1827Google Scholar, 12Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Google Scholar, 13Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar). The status of histone acetylation is dictated by the opposite action of the two enzymes histone acetyltransferase (HAT), which catalyzes acetylation of lysine residues present at the N-terminal part of the histone tail, and the histone deacetyltransferase (HDAC), which removes acetyl groups. Indeed, NF-κB binding to transcriptional active chromatin is influenced by the status of histone acetylation/phosphorylation (14Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Google Scholar, 15Saccani S. Natoli G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2219-2224Google Scholar, 16Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Google Scholar). Whether the level of histone acetylation impacts bacteria-induced NF-κB-dependent gene expression in IEC is currently unknown. In vivo, the response of IEC to commensal bacteria is regulated by adjacent lamina propria mononuclear cells, which mediate immunologic tolerance and maintain mucosal homeostasis (17Strober W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 859: 37-45Google Scholar). Among the anti-inflammatory molecules implicated in the regulation of intestinal homeostasis, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 has been shown to play a key role in controlling proliferation, differentiation, and function of numerous immune and non-immune cells (18Hartsough M.T. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 21-41Google Scholar, 19Yue J. Mulder K.M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 91: 1-34Google Scholar, 20Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Google Scholar). The biological effect of TGF-β1 is mediated through activation of various signaling cascades such as Smad and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, the latter including extracellular signal-regulated kinases, stress-activated protein kinases/c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and the p38 pathway. Upon TGF-β1 binding to the receptor complex, the Smad signaling pathway is activated through phosphorylation of the receptor activated Smad1–3 (R-Smads), which dissociate from the receptor complex and associate with the common partner Smad4 (co-Smad4). Resulting heterodimers then translocate to the nucleus and directly bind to Smad-binding elements on the DNA to induce target gene transcription (21Derynck R. Feng X.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Google Scholar, 22Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref Google Scholar, 23Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar, 24Piek E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Another important aspect of TGF-β signal transduction is the induction/activation of inhibitory molecules such as Smad6 and Smad7, which act as negative regulators of TGF-β1/Smad signaling by interfering with either the activation of R-Smads or the association of R-Smads with Smad4 (25Wrana J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 189-192Google Scholar). Although TGF-β1 regulates the host immune response to various micro-organisms and inflammatory mediators (26Chen W. Jin W. Cook M. Weiner H.L. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6297-6304Google Scholar, 27Song X. Zeng L. Pilo C.M. Zagorski J. Wahl S.M. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4020-4026Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we characterized TGF-β1 signal transduction in IEC and investigated its effect on bacteria-induced NF-κB signaling. We report that TGF-β1-activated Smad signaling mediates inhibition of B. vulgatus and LPS-induced NF-κB recruitment to the IL-6 gene promoter through modulation of histone acetylation. Activation of this inhibitory pathway may be important in down-regulating IEC responses to commensal bacteria. Cell Culture and Bacterial Stimulation of IEC—The mouse IEC line CMT93 (passage 10–30) (ATCC CRL 223, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) was grown to confluency in 12- or 6-well plates (Nunc). B. vulgatus derived from a guinea pig with carrageenaninduced colitis (a gift from Dr. A. B. Onderdonk, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) was anaerobically grown at 37 °C in brain-heart infusion, and B. vulgatus lysates were prepared as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Confluent monolayers of IEC were stimulated with B. vulgatus (5 × 107 cfu/ml), B. vulgatus lysate (100 μg of protein/ml), or LPS (10 μg/ml; from E. coli serotype O111:B4, Sigma). Where indicated IEC were treated with TGF-β1 (20 ng/ml, R & D Systems) and the specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (2 h pretreatment with 1 μg/ml, Sigma). Immunohistochemistry and Isolation of Primary Intestinal Epithelial Cells—Germ-free (sterile) Fisher F344 rats were monoassociated at 10–12 weeks of age with B. vulgatus and maintained in the Gnotobiotic Animal Core at the College of Veterinary Medicine, North Carolina State University, Raleigh. Bacterial monoassociation was confirmed by anaerobic culture of stool samples. Rats were killed at day 3 and 7 after initial bacterial colonization. Sections of the ileum, cecum, and proximal and distal colon were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The fixed tissue was embedded in paraffin. Immunohistochemistry was performed using anti-phospho-NF-κB p65 (RelA), anti-phospho-Smad2, anti-phospho-c-Jun, and anti-phospho-p38 Abs (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Histology scoring was analyzed by scoring the degree of lamina propria mononuclear cell infiltration, crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, and architectural distortion as described previously (8Rath H.C. Herfarth H.H. Ikeda J.S. Grenther W.B. Hamm T.E.J. Balish E. Taurog J.D. Hammer R.E. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 945-953Google Scholar). Adenoviral Infection—CMT93 cells were infected overnight with Ad5κB-LUC as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Where indicated CMT93 were co-infected for an additional 12 h with Ad5IκBαAA or Ad5Smad7 (a generous gift from Dr. David A. Brenner, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) or Ad5Smad3ΔC or Ad5Smad3/Ad5Smad4 (a generous gift of Dr. X. F. Wang, Duke University, Durham, NC) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50. The Smad3ΔC, Smad3, and Smad4 constructs were described previously by Wu et al. (28Wu R.Y. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Derynck R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2521-2528Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (29Zhang Y. Musci T. Derynck R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 270-276Google Scholar). The Ad5GFP containing green fluorescent protein was used as a viral negative control. The adenoviruses were washed off, and fresh medium containing serum was added. Cells were stimulated at various time points with B. vulgatus (5 × 107 cfu/ml), B. vulgatus lysate (100 μg/ml), or LPS (10 μg/ml). Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—CMT93 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing 3TP-LUX (1 μg, a generous gift of Dr. Richard A. Rippe, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Cells were then stimulated with TGF-β1 (20 ng/ml) for 12 h. Cell extracts were prepared using enhanced luciferase assay reagents (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego). Luciferase assay were performed on a Monolight 2010 luminometer for 20 s (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego), and results were normalized for extract protein concentrations measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—CMT93 cells were stimulated with LPS for 0–2 h. After stimulation, IEC were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (1 time) and fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1%. Nuclear extraction and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (16Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 69-75Google Scholar). Cells were lysed after formaldehyde fixation in L1 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Nuclei were pelleted and resuspended in 300 μl of L2 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm EDTA). Chromatin was sheared by sonication (4 times for 15 s at about one-fifth of maximum power), centrifuged, and diluted in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 m NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Extracts were normalized according to their DNA concentration and were precleared for 3 h with salmon sperm-saturated protein A/G-agarose. Immunoprecipitation were carried out overnight at 4 °C using 10 μl of anti-NF-κB p65 Ab (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm-saturated protein A/G-agarose for 30 min and washed three times in high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) followed by three washes with no salt buffer (TE 1×). Immune complexes were extracted 3 times with 150 μl of extraction buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO2). DNA cross-links were reverted by heating for 8 h at 65 °C. After proteinase K (100 μg for 1 h) digestion, DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated in ethanol. DNA isolated from an aliquot of the total nuclear extract was used as a loading control for the PCR (input control). PCR was performed with total DNA (1 μl, input control) and immunoprecipitated DNA (1 μl) using the following IL-6 promoter-specific primers: IL-6A (5′) 5-GACATGCTCAAGTGCTGAGTCAC-3 (position 987–1009) and IL-6B (3′) 5-AGATTGCACAATGTGACGTCG-3 (position 1112–1132). The length of the amplified product was 125 bp. The PCR products (10 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing gel Star fluorescent dye (FMC, Philadelphia, PA). Fluorescent staining was captured using an AlphaImager 2000 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). In Vitro Kinase Assays—IKK activity on B. vulgatus-induced serine RelA phosphorylation was determined by immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Briefly, CMT93 cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors after stimulation with B. vulgatus/LPS at various times in the presence or absence of TGF-β1. 300 μg was immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of anti-IKKγ (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and the kinase reaction was performed by glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p65 (1–305 and 354–551) (a generous gift of Dr. Hiroaki Sakurai, Tanabe Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) as substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. Substrate protein was resolved by gel electrophoresis, and phosphate incorporation was assessed by audioradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified (reverse transcriptase PCR) using specific primers for mouse IL-6 and GAPDH as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotide primers were used: IL-6-A, (5′) 5-ATGAAGTTCCTCTCTGCAAGAGACT-3 (position 35–56), and IL-6-B, (3′) 5-CACTAGGTTTGCCGAGTAGATCTC-3 (position 646–669); GAPDH-A, (5′) 5-CGGTGCTGAGTATGTCGTGGAGTCT-3 (position 310–334), and GAPDH-B, (3′) 5-GTTATTATGGGGGTCTGGGATGGAA-3 (position 1140–1164). The length of the amplified product was of 638 and 854 bp, respectively. Western Blot Analysis—CMT93 cells were stimulated for various times (0–4 h) with B. vulgatus (5 × 107 cfu/ml), B. vulgatus lysate (100 μg/ml), or LPS (10 μg/ml). The cells were lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer, and 20 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Where indicated CMT93 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (100 ng/ml, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-phosphoserine Smad2 (Ser-465/467, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-phosphoserine Smad2/3 (Ser-433/435, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Smad4/DPC4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), anti-phosphoserine IκBα (S32, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-phosphoserine RelA (S536, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-phosphoserine Akt (S473, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-acetyl and phosphohistone 3 (Lys-9/Ser-10, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and anti-β-actin (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) were used to detect immunoreactive phospho-Smad2, phospho-Smad2/3, Smad4/DPC, phospho-IκBα, phospho-RelA, phospho-Akt, acetyl-phosphohistone 3, and β-actin, respectively, using enhanced chemiluminescence light detecting kit (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation—CMT93 cells were stimulated with B. vulgatus/LPS for 30 min in the presence or absence of TGF-β1. Where indicated CMT-93 cells were co-infected with Ad5Smad3 and Ad5Smad4. Nuclear extract were prepared as described above, and protein concentration was normalized. Immunoprecipitation were carried out overnight at 4 °C using 10 μl of anti-NF-κB p65 Ab (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Immune complexes were collected with protein A/G-agarose for 30 min and washed 3 times in high salt buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA) followed by three washes with no salt buffer (1 TE). The immune complexes were cleaved from the beads by adding 50 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer. Western blot analysis was carried out using anti-CBP/p300 Ab (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) as described above. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—CMT93 cells were stimulated for various times (0–4 h) with B. vulgatus lysate (100 μg/ml), and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Extracts (5 μg) were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded class I major histocompatibility complex κB sites (GGCTGGGGATTCCCCATCT), separated by nondenaturating electrophoresis, and analyzed by autoradiography as described previously (30Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234Google Scholar). ELISA—CMT93 cells were stimulated with B. vulgatus and LPS for 16–24 h. Murine IL-6 was determined in the cell culture supernatant using ELISA (R & D Systems). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. of triplicate experiments. Statistical significance was performed by the twotailed Student's t test for paired data and considered significant if p values were <0.05 and <0.01. B. vulgatus Monoassociated Rats Show Nuclear Localization of Phospho-RelA and Phospho-Smad2 in IEC—We first sought to demonstrate activation of NF-κB and TGF-β signaling in vivo following B. vulgatus monoassociation of germ-free Fisher F344 rats. Monoassociated rats were killed 3 and 7 days after initial bacterial colonization, and sections of the ileum, cecum, proximal and distal colon were analyzed by using immunohistochemical analysis and histological scoring. Fig. 1A shows nuclear localization of phospho-RelA (Ser-536) in cecal epithelial cells 3 days after B. vulgatus monoassociation but not at day 7 or in germ-free controls, suggesting transient NF-κB activation in intestinal epithelial cells after initial bacterial colonization. Nuclear phospho-RelA staining was stronger in the surface region of the cecal epithelium and almost absent in the ileum, the proximal and distal colon, or in lamina propria cells (Fig. 1B). None of the histologically examined sections revealed signs of pathologic inflammation. Interestingly and in contrast to RelA, nuclear phospho-Smad2 is sustained throughout days 3 and 7 after bacterial monoassociation, with no signal detected in germ-free controls (Fig. 2A). Nuclear phospho-Smad2 staining was first detected in the lower crypt region of the cecal epithelium at day 3 but was strongest in the surface region at day 7 after initial bacterial colonization of germ-free rats. Similar to the localization of phospho-RelA, phospho-Smad2 was almost absent in the ileum, the proximal and distal colon, or in lamina propria cells (Fig. 2B). In addition, bacteria-induced RelA and Smad2 phosphorylation in primary large intestinal epithelial cells isolated from B. vulgatus-monoassociated germ-free rats was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3A). We next sought to determine whether B. vulgatus induces RelA and Smad2 phosphorylation ex vivo in primary IEC isolated from germ-free rats. Fig. 3B shows that B. vulgatus stimulation induces RelA but not Smad2 phosphorylation, suggesting that bacteria-induced Smad signaling is mediated by activation of TGF-β production by adjacent intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells.Fig. 3A and B, B. vulgatus induces RelA but not Smad2 phosphorylation in isolated primary IEC.A, germ-free Fisher F344 rats were monoassociated with B. vulgatus. Rats were killed at day 3 and 7 after initial bacterial colonization and primary IEC from the cecum and colon were isolated. Total protein was extracted, and 20 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by phospho-RelA, phospho-Smad2, and β-actin immunoblotting using the ECL technique. B, primary IEC from cecum and colon were isolated from germ-free Fisher F344 rats. IEC were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells per ml and stimulated with B. vulgatus (7 × 107 cfu/ml) for 0–4 h. Total protein was extracted, and 20 μg of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by phospho-RelA, phospho-Smad2, and β-actin immunoblotting using the ECL technique.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data suggest different temporal and spatial phospho-RelA and phospho-Smad2 distribution in B. vulgatus-monoassociated rats and demonstrate that TGF-β1 and NF-κB signaling pathways are activated in the intestine in vivo after non-pathogenic bacterial colonization. TGF-β1 Activates the Smad Signal Transduction Pathway in IEC Lines—Since B. vulgatus-monoassociated rats showed nuclear localization of phospho-Smad2 in IEC (Figs. 1 and 2), we next sought to investigate TGF-β1 signal transduction in IEC. It is well established that TGF-β1 activates the Smad signaling pathway in numerous cell types (31Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Google Scholar); however, TGF-β1 signaling has not yet been investigated in IEC. TGF-β1 induced rapid (15 min) Smad2 phosphorylation in the colonic mouse epithelial cell line CMT93, whereas the level of total unphosphorylated protein remained unaffected (Fig. 4A). We next investigated whether phosphorylated Smad2/3 associates with co-Smad4 in TGF-β1-stimulated CMT93 cells. As shown by immunoprecipitation analysis, phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 (Fig. 4B, upper panel) rapidly associated with Smad4 in TGF-β1-stimulated CMT93 cells, but this association was transient with little evidence of complexing at 60 min. TGF-β1-activated Smad2 phosphorylation was confirmed in mouse primary IEC isolated from 129SvEv wild type mice (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that TGF-β1 induces the Smad signaling cascade in primary and IEC lines. Finally, we investigated the functional consequences of TGF-β1-induced Smad activation in CMT93 cells by using LipofectAMINE-based transfection of the TGF-β-responsive reporter gene 3TP-LUX. Fig. 4D shows an almost 4-fold increase in luciferase activity in TGF-β1-stimulated CMT93 cells. TGF-β1 Inhibits Non-pathogenic Gram-negative B. vulgatus and LPS-induced NF-κB Transcriptional Activity and IL-6 Gene Expression in IEC—B. vulgatus induces NF-κB activity and proinflammatory gene expression in IEC (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar). Since TGF-β1 has important immunosuppressive activity (20Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 137-161Google Scholar), we evaluated its effect on B. vulgatus and LPS-mediated NF-κB transcriptional activation in IEC. We infected mouse CMT93 cells with an adenoviral vector encoding for the (κB)-luciferase reporter gene (Ad5κB-LUC) alone or in combination with the IκBα super-repressor (Ad5IκBαAA) and then stimulated with B. vulgatus, B. vulgatus lysate, or LPS in the presence or absence of TGF-β1. As shown in Fig. 5A, TGF-β1 significantly inhibited B. vulgatus, B. vulgatus lysate, and LPS-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in CMT93 cells (53, 40, and 47%, respectively). In accordance with previous results (3Haller D. Russo M.P. Sartor R.B. Jobin C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38168-38178Google Scholar),"
https://openalex.org/W2082508806,"The KK/San obese and diabetic mouse, a mutant strain from KK obese mice, exhibits significantly low plasma triglyceride levels. In KK/San mice, genetic analysis identified a mutation in the gene encoding angiopoietinlike protein 3 (Angptl3), a liver-specific secretory protein, which had suppressive effect on lipoprotein lipase activity. In the current study, LXR ligands augmented Angptl3 mRNA expression and protein production in hepatoma cells. LXR ligands and LXR·retinoid X receptor (RXR) complex increased the promoter activity of Angptl3 gene. Serial deletion and point mutation of Angptl3 promoter identified an LXR response element (LXRE). Gel mobility shift assay showed the direct binding of LXR·RXR complex to the LXRE of the Angptl3 promoter. Furthermore, treatment of mice with synthetic LXR ligand caused triglyceride accumulation in the liver and plasma, which was accompanied by induction of hepatic mRNAs of several LXR target genes, including sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and Angptl3. In Angptl3-deficient C57BL/6J mice, LXR ligand did not cause hypertriglyceridemia but accumulation of triglyceride in the liver. Our results demonstrate that Angptl3 is a direct target of LXR and that induction of hepatic Angptl3 accounts for hypertriglyceridemia associated with the treatment of LXR ligand.

In Angptl3-deficient C57BL/6J mice, LXR ligand did not cause hypertriglyceridemia but accumulation of triglyceride in the liver. Our results demonstrate that Angptl3 is a direct target of LXR and that induction of hepatic Angptl3 accounts for hypertriglyceridemia associated with the treatment of LXR ligand. There is a growing realization that hypertriglyceridemia plays a central role in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance syndrome. Hypertriglyceridemia induces triglyceride accumulation in various tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscles, liver, and pancreatic islets, which results in disturbed insulin signaling in each tissue (1Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Hypertriglyceridemia is also directly involved in the development of atherosclerosis (2Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Therefore, the factors that regulate the amount of triglycerides in plasma could be viewed as potentially attractive pharmaceutical targets (3Rossetti L. Goldberg I.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the colony of KK obese mice, which exhibit diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, we found a subgroup of KK mice (KK/San) with significantly low plasma triglyceride levels, although the phenotype of obesity and diabetes was still maintained (4Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis and positional cloning in the KK/San mice identified a 4-bp nucleotide insertion in exon 6 of the gene encoding angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl3), 1The abbreviations used are: Angptl3, angiopoietin-like protein 3; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; LXR, liver X receptor; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; FAS, fatty acid synthase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; LXRE, LXR-responsive element; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein.1The abbreviations used are: Angptl3, angiopoietin-like protein 3; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; LXR, liver X receptor; SREBP1c, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c; FAS, fatty acid synthase; RXR, retinoid X receptor; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; LXRE, LXR-responsive element; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglyceride; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. which caused a premature termination after frameshift (4Koishi R.

Angptl3 is a ∼70-kDa secretory protein, and its mRNA is expressed exclusively in the livers of humans and mice (5Conklin D. Gilbertson D. Taft D.W. Maurer M.F. Whitmore T.E. Smith D.L. Walker K.M. Chen L.H. Wattler S. Nehls M. Lewis K.B. Genomics. 1999; 62: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The protein contains a coiled-coil region and fibrinogen-like motif and shows similarity in amino acid sequence and structure with angiopoietin (5Conklin D. Gilbertson D. Taft D.W. Maurer M.F.

Angptl3 can also induce angioneogenesis at a lesser degree than angiopoietin (6Camenisch G. Pisabarro M.T. Sherman D. Kowalski J. Nagel M. Hass P. Xie M.H. Gurney A. Bodary S. Liang X.H. Clark K.

Consistent with the hypotriglyceridemia in KK/San mice exhibiting a genetic defect of Angptl3, Angptl3 protein has a physiological capability to increase the plasma triglyceride levels. Recent studies reported that either the injection of recombinant ANGPTL3 protein or adenovirus-mediated production of ANGPTL3 acutely increased plasma triglyceride levels in both KK/San and wild-type lean mice (4Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the effect of Angptl3 on plasma triglyceride was mediated by suppression of lipoprotein lipase activity with subsequent inhibition of hydrolysis of plasma triglyceride (7Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yoshida K. Ando Y. Koishi R. Ueda K. Inaba T. Minekura H. Kohama T. Furukawa H. J. Biol.

Liver X receptor (LXR) is a nuclear receptor that forms a heterodimer with RXR and activates the transcription of several genes involved in lipid metabolism by targeting the DR4 element in the promoters (8Lu T.T. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37735-37738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of LXR known to date. LXRα (NR1H3) is expressed selectively in the liver, fat, and macrophages, whereas LXRβ (NR1H2) is expressed ubiquitously (9Shinar D.M. Endo N. Rutledge S.J. Vogel R. Rodan G.A. Schmidt A.

Several cholesterol derivatives such as (22R)-hydroxycholesterol and (24S),25-epoxycholesterol are known endogenous ligands of LXR (13Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A.

Since LXR activation increases the transcription of ABCA1 through its LXRE on the promoter, T0901317 seems to enhance the ABCA1-mediated efflux of cellular cholesterol in various cells, especially macrophages (16Plosch T.

This effect of LXR ligand leads to a reduction of atherosclerotic plaque in vivo (19Joseph S.B. McKilligin E. Pei L. Watson M.A. Collins A.R. Laffitte B.A. Chen M. Noh G. Goodman J. Hagger G.N.

However, treatment of rodents with T0901317 caused triglyceride accumulation in the liver and plasma. Accumulation of triglycerides in the liver was explained by increased expression of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP1c) and fatty acid synthase (FAS), both of which are direct targets of LXR. However, the mechanism underlying LXR-induced hypertriglyceridemia is not known at present (20Joseph S.B. Laffitte B.A. Patel P.H. Watson M.A. Matsukuma K.E. Walczak R. Collins J.L. Osborne T.F. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11019-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the Angptl3 is a direct target gene of LXR. Both T0901317 and endogenous LXR ligands increased the hepatic mRNA expression and the secretion of Angptl3. In Angptl3-deficient mice, T0901317 treatment did not increase plasma triglyceride levels. Our results indicated that hypertriglyceridemia associated with synthetic LXR ligand treatment was due to overproduction of hepatic ANGPTL3 protein into plasma, which inhibited the hydrolysis of plasma triglyceride in the body. Reagents—T0901317 was purchased from Cayman Chemical. 9-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and (22R)-hydroxycholesterol were obtained from Sigma. (24S),25-Epoxycholesterol was purchased from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). Plasmids expressing cDNA for human RXRα (pCMX-hRXRα) and human LXRα (pCMX-hLXRα) were kindly provided by Dr. David Mangelsdorf (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Cell Cultures—HepG2 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cultures were performed under standard conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2 in air). The cells were seeded into six-well plates (Corning, NY) and allowed to grow in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. At 80% confluence, the cells were replaced with fresh 10% fetal calf serum DMEM, containing T0901317, 9-cis-RA, (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, or (24S),25-epoxycholesterol. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Construction and Assay—Recombinant human ANGPTL3 protein was prepared as described previously (4Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Furukawa H. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Two ANGPTL3 mouse monoclonal antibodies were produced using the recombinant human ANGPTL3 as the antigen and were introduced in a double-antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay system to detect human ANGPTL3. Culture media containing ANGPTL3 protein were condensed with Microcon YM-10 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and subjected to the immunoassay system using a horseradish peroxidase enzyme method. Two ANGPTL3 rabbit polyclonal antibodies against two peptides (CLSQQHMQIKEIEKQLR and CSFDSAPSEPKSRFAML) of mouse ANGPTL3 were produced and were introduced in a double antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay system to detect mouse ANGPTL3. Plasmid Construction—The 5′-flanking region of human Angptl3 gene (–781/+79, relative to the transcription start site) was prepared by PCR using human genomic DNA (Roche Applied Science) as a template and a forward primer tailed with a KpnI restriction site (5′-AAGGTACCAATTCTAGTTTGGTCCTAGA-3′) and a reverse primer tailed with BamHI (5′-TTGGATCCTCTTGATCAATTCTGCAGGA-3′). The PCR product was digested with KpnI and BamHI and subcloned into the KpnI/BglII-digested luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-basic (Promega, Madison, WI), generating pGL3/–781+79hAngptl3. For the construction of pGL3/–282+79hAngptl3 or pGL3/–126+79hAngptl3, pGL3/–781+79hAngptl3 was digested with DraI/HindIII or HpaI/HindIII, respectively, and subcloned into the SmaI/HindIII-digested pGL3 basic vector. For the construction of pGL3/–151+79hAngptl3, a DNA fragment was generated by PCR using pGL3/–781+79hAngptl3 as a template and a KpnI site-tailed forward primer (5′-CGGGGTACCGAAGGTTACATTCGTGCAAGTT-3′) and a BamHI-tailed reverse primer (5′-TTGGATCCTCTTGATCAATTCTGCAGGA-3′). After digestion with KpnI and BamHI, it was subcloned into the KpnI/BglII-digested pGL3 basic vector. Site-directed mutagenesis of the construct pGL3/–781+79hAngptl3 was accomplished using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and two pairs of 32-mer oligonucleotides containing mutations corresponding, respectively, to nucleotide –146(T → A)/–147(G → A) and nucleotide –136(G → A)/–137(T → A) of the DR4 element in human Angptl3 promoter. The integrity of each plasmid was verified by DNA sequencing. Transient Transfection and Reporter Assay—HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum 24 h prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with plasmids in serum-free Opti-MEM I medium using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the supplier. Typically, each well contained 1 μl of LipofectAMINE™ 2000, 15 ng of pCMX-hRXRα and/or pCMX-hLXRα expression vector, 60 ng of pGL3 basic luciferase reporter plasmids containing the 5′-flanking region of the human Angptl3 gene, and 60 ng of pCMX-β-galatactosidase as an internal control for transfection efficiency. After adding the reagents, cells were transfected for 4 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells were then incubated for ∼40–48 h in fresh DMEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum with T0901317, 9-cis-RA, (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, (24S),25-epoxycholesterol, or vehicle. Cell lysates were produced using passive lysis buffer (Promega) using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined using luciferase assay buffer (Promega) in a Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices). β-Galactosidase activity was determined using β-d-galactopyranoside (Calbiochem) as described previously (21Lu T.T. Makishima M. Repa J.J. Schoonjans K. Kerr T.A. Auwerx J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity individually for each well. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—Human RXRα and human LXRα proteins were synthesized in vitro from pCMX-hRXRα and pCMX-hLXRα expression vectors by using the TNT® Quik Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the LXR response element of the human Angptl3 gene promoter (LXREwt; 5′-GGAAGAAGGTTACATTCGTGCAAGTTAA-3′) were 32P-radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Protein-DNA binding assays were performed as described previously (22Kishida K. Shimomura I. Nishizawa H. Maeda N. Kuriyama H. Kondo H. Matsuda M. Nagaretani H. Ouchi N. Hotta K. Kihara S. Kadowaki T. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48572-48579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Salmon sperm DNA (0.5 μg/μl) was added in binding assays to reduce nonspecific binding of labeled oligonucleotides. A 10- or 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded LXREwt, the mutant LXR response element of the human Angptl3 gene promoter (LXREmut; 5′-GGAAGAAGAATACATTCGAACAAGTTAA-3′) or nonspecific oligonucleotides (5′-ACTATTCTGTATGCAGCTGCGAGCCCCAGCCCCAGG-3′) were used for the competition experiments. The samples were electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (4.5 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 10 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and autoradiographed at –80 °C. Animal Studies—C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Charles River, and C57BL/ANGPTL3hypl mice were from the Medical Safety Research Laboratories (Sankyo Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) and housed in a room under controlled temperature (23 ± 1 °C) and humidity (45–65%) and had free access to water and chow (Oriental Yeast). Experiments were conducted when the mice (males) were between 8 and 9 weeks of age. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Osaka University and Sankyo Co., Ltd. On the day before the start of treatment (day 0), blood was collected to determine the initial plasma total cholesterol (TC) and triglyceride (TG) levels. Then the mice were divided into two groups, arranged so that the mean values of TC and TG in each group were almost equal. Mice were treated orally with T0901317 at a dose of 10 mg/kg daily in a propylene glycol/Tween 80 (4:1) formulation. Blood was collected under nonfasting conditions. Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—Plasma lipid (TC and TG) levels were determined using commercial kits (Cholesterol CII-test Wako and Triglycerides E-test Wako, respectively; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Hepatic lipids were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (23Folch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extract was dissolved in 10% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in 2-propanol. Then both hepatic TC and TG contents were determined by using commercial kits as described above. The plasma (20 μl) was further diluted with 80 μl of 10 mmol/liter sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 mol/liter NaCl (PBS) and was used for the analysis of lipoproteins by a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system with two tandem gel permeation columns (TSK gel Lipopropak XL, 7.5 × 300 mm; Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) and an online enzymatic detection system for total cholesterol. RNA Analysis—Total RNAs from HepG2 cells were prepared with an RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). The cDNA was produced using TaqMan reverse transcription kits (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Real time PCR was performed on a LightCycler using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Applied Science) using the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Primers were designed as 5′-CCAGAACACCCAGAAGTAACT-3′ and 5′-TCTGTGGGTTCTTGAATACTAGTC-3′ for human Angptl3. Primers of 18 S ribosomal RNA were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The amount of Angptl3 mRNA was expressed relative to the level of 18 S RNA mRNA. Total RNAs from mouse liver were isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) based on the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Total RNA (1 μg) was used to generate cDNA using oligo(dT) oligonucleotide primer (T12–18) following the protocol for the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Real time quantitative PCR analysis was performed using ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). Equal amounts of cDNA were used and amplified with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Levels of various mRNAs were normalized to those of cyclophilin as described previously (24Terasaka N. Hiroshima A. Koieyama T. Ubukata N. Morikawa Y. Nakai D. Inaba T. FEBS Lett. 2003; 536: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The sequences of primers and TaqMan probes were designed as follows: forward primer, 5′-ACATGTGGCTGAGATTGCTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCTTTGCTCTGTGATTCCATGTAG-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-CCTCCCAGAGCACACAGACCTGATGTTT-3′ for mouse Angptl3; forward primer, 5′-AAGCTGTCGGGGTAGCGTCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGAGCATGTCTTCAAATGTGC-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-CTAGGGGATCGGCGCGGACCACGGAGC-3′ for mouse SREBP1c; forward primer, 5′-GAGGCCTGTACGGGATCATA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGAGCCTTGTAAGTTCTGTG-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-TACATGACCAGCGCTCTGGGCATCACAGCC-3′ for mouse stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1; forward primer, 5′-CGATGACGAGCCCTTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCTGCTCTTTGGAACTTTGTC-3′; Taqman probe, 5′-CGCGTCTCCTTTGAGCTGTTTGCA-3′ for cyclophilin. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using Student's t test or Dunnett's multiple comparison test. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Angptl3 Gene Expression and Protein Production Are Induced by LXR Agonists in HepG2 Cells—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were used to analyze the regulation of Angptl3 mRNA expression and protein secretion. Angptl3 mRNA expression increased in a dose-dependent manner by the treatment with T0901317, with 6-fold peak increase following the addition of 1 μM T0901317 (Fig. 1A, upper panel). To investigate whether the Angptl3 gene is regulated by the LXR·RXR heterodimer, we added RXR agonist 9-cis-RA (1 μM) with 1 μM T0901317. Angptl3 mRNA expression increased further up to 7-fold by the addition of 9-cis-RA (Fig. 1A, upper panel). ANGPTL3 protein secreted in the media also increased in a dose-dependent manner with T0901317 treatment, and the addition of 9-cis-RA further increased ANGPTL3 secretion in the media (Fig. 1A, lower panel). The mRNA and protein secretion of Angptl3 were increased by 1 μM T0901317 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Thus, the increased expression of Angptl3 mRNA was accompanied by increased production of ANGPTL3 protein after T0901317 treatment. Angptl3 mRNA levels were increased by the addition of 30 μM (24S),25-epoxycholesterol, (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, both of which are endogenous LXR ligands, or 1 μM T0901317 (Fig. 1C). Similar results of the effect of synthetic and natural LXR ligands on the Angptl3 mRNA and protein were seen in rat hepatoma H4IIEC3 cells (data not shown). Thus, LXR agonists induced the expression and secretion of Angptl3 in hepatocytes. T0901317 and Endogenous LXR Ligands Enhance LXR·RXR-mediated Increase of Angptl3 Promoter Activity through the DR4 Element on Its Promoter—Fig. 2 shows the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of human Angptl3 gene. Computer analysis revealed the putative binding sites of transcriptional factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, glucocorticoid receptor, hepatic nuclear factor, and LXR. To investigate the effect of T0901317 on the transcription of the Angptl3 gene, we cloned its promoter region from human genomic DNA and constructed a luciferase reporter plasmid containing the 5′-flanking region (–781/+79) of the human Angptl3 gene. In transfection assays with the luciferase reporter constructs, T0901317 enhanced the luciferase activity driven by the 5′-flanking region of the Angptl3 gene in HepG2 cells, and the addition of 9-cis-RA augmented this increase (Fig. 3A). Co-expression of LXRα and RXRα further augmented the T0901317-mediated increase of luciferase activity compared with the expression of LXRα or RXRα alone (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows the effects of endogenous LXR ligands, (24S),25-epoxycholesterol and (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, on luciferase activity driven by the human Angptl3 promoter in HepG2 cells. The endogenous ligands also augmented luciferase activity, in addition to T0901317, similar to the mRNA regulation depicted in Fig. 1C, and a further increase was observed when LXRα and RXRα were co-expressed, compared with the expression of either construct (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3T0901317 augments LXR·RXR-mediated increase of human Angptl3 gene promoter activity through the DR4 element. A and B, promoter activity of Angptl3 induced by LXR ligands. HepG2 cells (3.2 × 104 cells/well of 96-well plate) were transfected with 15 ng of expression plasmids encoding human RXRα, human LXRα, or the empty pCMX vector as control; 60 ng of reporter plasmids containing the firefly luciferase gene driven by 5′-flanking region of the human Angptl3 gene; and 60 ng of pCMX-lacZ, using the LipofectAMINE™ 2000 transfection reagent. A, after 4-h transfection, cells were treated with ethanol (open bars), 100 nm T0901317 (hatched bars), or 100 nm T0901317 plus 1 μm of 9-cis-retinoic acid (solid bars) for 40 h, before harvest. B, cells were treated with ethanol (open bars), 30 μm (22R)-hydroxycholesterol (22(R)H.C.; gray bars), 30 μm (24S),25-epoxycholesterol (24,25E.C.; hatched bars), or 100 nm T0901317 (solid bars) for 40 h before harvest. The cell lysates were used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Reporter plasmid containing the –781/+79 region of the human Angptl3 gene was used for transfection assays. C, HepG2 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids containing the serially deleted promoter of the human Angptl3 gene and expression vectors of human LXRα and human RXRα or control vector (pCMX). After transfection, cells were treated without (gray bars) or with 100 nm T0901317 (solid bars) before harvest, and luciferase assays were conducted similarly to A and B. A–C, luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activity for each well. *, p < 0.01, compared with the control group using Student's t test.

Serial deletions showed that the T0901317-mediated induction of luciferase activities was highly maintained when the constructs contained the region of –151/–126 (Fig. 3C). This region contained the putative LXRE suggested by computer search. Fig. 3D shows comparison of the sequences of the DR4 element in the promoters of human and mouse Angptl3 genes with the DR4 previously described in other LXR target genes (18Zhang Y. Repa J.J.

To further determine the significance of LXRE in the promoter of the Angptl3 gene, we generated a construct containing the point mutation in LXRE and compared the response to T0901317 between the wild-type and mutant constructs (Fig. 4A). The point mutation of LXRE in the Angptl3 gene promoter totally abolished the response to T0901317 treatment (Fig. 4B). LXRα·RXRα Complex Binds to the Angptl3 LXRE—To determine whether LXRα binds to the LXRE as complexes with RXRα, gel mobility shift assays were performed with double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the Angptl3 LXRE (Fig. 5). The 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded LXREwt oligonucleotides were incubated with in vitro translated LXRα and/or RXRα protein. Neither LXRα nor RXRα alone bound to Angptl3 LXRE significantly (lanes 3 and 4). When LXRα and RXRα were produced together, the mobility of 32P-radiolabeled LXRE oligonucleotides were shifted to a higher range (lane 5 versus lane 2), indicating the binding of LXRα·RXRα complex to the Angptl3 LXRE. The addition of excessive unlabeled LXREwt oligonucleotides reduced the signal of 32P-radiolabeled LXREwt oligonucleotide binding to LXRα·RXRα complex (lanes 6 and 7 versus lane 5).

Both the MARCKS protein and a peptide corresponding to the effector domain (an unstructured region that contains 13 basic residues and 5 phenylalanines), MARCKS-(151–175), laterally sequester the polyvalent lipid PI(4,5)P2 in the plane of a bilayer membrane with high affinity. We used high resolution magic angle spinning NMR to establish the location of MARCKS-(151–175) in membrane bilayers, which is necessary to understand the sequestration mechanism. Measurements of cross-relaxation rates in two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy NMR experiments show that the five Phe rings of MARCKS-(151–175) penetrate into the acyl chain region of phosphatidylcholine bilayers containing phosphatidylglycerol or PI(4,5)P2. Specifically, we observed strong cross-peaks between the aromatic protons of the Phe rings and the acyl chain protons of the lipids, even for very short (50 ms) mixing times. The position of the Phe rings implies that the adjacent positively charged amino acids in the peptide are close to the level of the negatively charged lipid phosphates. The deep location of the MARCKS peptide in the polar head group region should enhance its electrostatic sequestration of PI(4,5)P2 by an “image charge” mechanism. Moreover, this location has interesting implications for membrane curvature and local surface pressure effects and may be relevant to a wide variety of other proteins with basic-aromatic clusters, such as phospholipase D, GAP43, SCAMP2, and the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor.

For instance, binding of PI(4,5)P2 to the basic-aromatic cluster on phospholipase D activates the enzyme (9Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Wang J.Y. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to basic-aromatic clusters of phospholipase D and MARCKS bind PI(4,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity compared with monovalent acid lipids such as phosphatidylserine (11Sciorra V.A.

To establish how these clusters can bind to the membrane, selectively sequester PI(4,5)P2, and possibly exert other effects on membrane structure, we need to establish their specific location within the bilayer. This study focuses on the effector domain of the MARCKS protein, one of the major substrates for protein kinase C (for reviews, see Refs. 14Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 15Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Arbuzova A. Schmitz A.A.P. Vergeres G. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). MARCKS associates with membranes through an N-terminal myristoyl group and a cluster of basic-aromatic amino acids in its effector domain (16Arbuzova A. Schmitz A.A.P. Vergeres G. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The five Phe residues in the basic effector domain may influence membrane binding or structure in several different ways, depending on the degree to which they penetrate the membrane bilayer. For example, as we discuss in more detail below, they could (i) contribute a hydrophobic term to the membrane-binding energy, (ii) enhance the electrostatic potential due to basic residues in the cluster, or (iii) induce membrane curvature. Determining the depth of the Phe residues within the membrane is the first step in understanding why they are often associated with basic residues in peripheral membrane proteins. An array of biophysical approaches has shed light on the conformation and location of the MARCKS-(151–175) peptide bound to lipid membranes. EPR spectroscopy (17Qin Z.H. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and circular dichroism (13Wang J.Y. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5012-5019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have shown that this peptide adopts an extended conformation when bound to membrane bilayers. Cafiso and co-workers (18Victor K. Jacob J. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12527-12536Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 19Victor K.G. Cafiso D.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2241-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have undertaken an extensive series of EPR studies on MARCKS-(151–175) to probe its location relative to the membrane surface. They systematically substituted amino acids in the MARCKS-(151–175) sequence with cysteines derivatized with nitroxide spin labels and found that spin labels attached at the highly basic and hydrophilic N and C termini of the peptide reside on the aqueous side of the lipid phosphate head group, whereas spin labels attached to the central Phe-containing portions of the peptide are located several angstroms below the lipid head group (17Qin Z.H. Cafiso D.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2917-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we used a complementary technique, magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectroscopy, to characterize the specific membrane location of amino acids in the membrane-bound MARCKS-(151–175) peptide. MAS is a solid-state NMR technique for obtaining high resolution NMR spectra of membrane proteins and peptides (20Smith S.O. Aschheim K. Groesbeek M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 395-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Gawrisch K. Eldho N.V. Polozov I.V. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2002; 116: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Baldus M. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 2002; 41: 1-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Typically, protons are not observed directly in solid-state experiments because MAS cannot average strong 1H-1H dipolar couplings. However, because membrane lipids exhibit a high degree of rotational and segmental motion in the liquid-crystalline phase, the proton dipolar couplings are partially averaged. Oldfield et al. (23Oldfield E. Bowers J.L. Forbes J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6919-6923Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were the first to fully recognize that high resolution 1H spectra of lipid membranes could be obtained using MAS. More recently, several groups have extended these methods to study peptides bound to membranes (24Davis J.H. Auger M. Hodges R.S. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1917-1932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 25Bouchard M. Davis J.H. Auger M. Biophys.

We used two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) in combination with MAS to investigate the location of the five Phe residues of the MARCKS effector domain within the negatively charged lipid bilayer by observing the correlations between protons of the lipid groups and protons on the aromatic phenylalanine side chains. Materials—Dimyristoylphosphocholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphoglycerol (DMPG), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphocholine (POPC) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. D2O (99.9%) was purchased from Acros Organics (Geel, Belgium). PI(4,5)P2 was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptides corresponding to the effector domain of the MARCKS protein (residues 151–175) were synthesized by solid-phase methods at the Center for the Analysis and Synthesis of Macromolecules at Stony Brook University or by Midwest Biotech (Fishers, IN). The sequence of MARCKS-(151–175) is 151KKKKKRFSFKKSFKLSGFSFKKNKK175. Synthetic peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (Varian Prostar) on a C18 column with an acetonitrile:water gradient and lyophilized. The solvents contained 0.1% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The purity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Sample Preparation—The samples containing DMPC and DMPG were prepared by first co-dissolving the lipids in chloroform and removing the chloroform with a flow of argon gas. The lipids were then dissolved in cyclohexane and lyophilized to form a fluffy powder. The powder was hydrated with H2O or D2O buffer (30 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7) at 30 °C. For DMPC:DMPG samples containing phenylalanine methyl ester or the MARCKS peptides, the lyophilized DMPC: DMPG powder was rehydrated with buffer containing peptides. The molar ratio of DMPC to DMPG was 100:30, and the molar ratio of total lipid to peptide was ∼100:1. After hydration, the samples were freezethawed and bath-sonicated five times and then centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 1 h. The pelleted multilayers were used for NMR experiments. The preparation of lipid membranes containing PI(4,5)P2 and bound MARCKS peptide was carried out as follows. The PI(4,5)P2 solution in chloroform:methanol:water was dried in a Teflon vial with a flow of argon gas; residual solvent was removed by placing the sample under vacuum for 2 h. PI(4,5)P2 was redissolved in chloroform and mixed with other lipids by vortexing in a 100-ml glass flask. After incubation at 35 °C for 20 min, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum. When the solvent was almost completely evaporated, the vacuum was increased to allow the remaining solvent to distill quickly. This procedure provides an even distribution of PI(4,5)P2 in the bulk lipid on the bottom of the flask (12Wang J.Y. Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Residual solvent was removed by placing the sample overnight under vacuum. The lyophilized MARCKS effector domain peptide (∼1 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of buffer (30 mm NaCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7) and added to the lipid mixture. Multilamellar vesicles were formed by slowly swirling and vortexing with a glass bead and then centrifuged at 265,000 × g for 1 h. In each sample, the molar ratio between PI(4,5)P2 and the MARCKS effector domain was ∼3:1. For a typical experiment, PI(4,5)P2 was 4% of the total membrane lipid. This yielded a peptide:lipid molar ratio of 1.3:100. Under our NMR conditions, where the lipid concentration was high, all the peptide was bound. Independent ζ potential experiments using low concentrations of lipid showed that the MARCKS peptide bound with comparable affinity to vesicles formed with lipids having either saturated or unsaturated chains. Specifically, addition of 3 μm peptide decreased the ζ potential of 3:1 DMPC:DMPG (or POPC:1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphoglycerol) vesicles formed in 100 mm KCl, pH 7, at 30 °C from –46 (or –43) mV to –6 (or –2) mV (data not shown). Moreover, in our NMR experiments, the peptide bound to both sides of the lipid membranes, so binding should not induce curvature in the multilamellar vesicles. NMR Spectroscopy—For NMR experiments, the pelleted multilayers were lyophilized, rehydrated with D2O or H2O to ∼50% (w/v), and transferred to 4-mm NMR sample rotors. High resolution MAS 1H NMR experiments were performed at 600 or 700 MHz on Bruker Avance NMR spectrometers using 4-mm MAS rotors. The temperature was maintained at 30 °C, well above the phase transition temperature of ∼22 °C for the DMPC:DMPG bilayers, for all experiments. The MAS frequency was regulated at 6000 or 6500 ± 1 Hz. Two-dimensional MAS NOESY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode with 256 or 512 slices in the t1 dimension. For all of the samples discussed below, two-dimensional NOESY spectra were obtained using a series of mixing times from 5 to 500 ms, and representative slices are typically shown for mixing times of 50 and 300 ms. Water presaturation was used on the 700-MHz spectrometer to attenuate the water signal. Experiments on the 600-MHz spectrometer were carried out in D2O. Simulations of spin diffusion were carried out using a one-dimensional lattice model adapted to lipid-protein systems by Kumashiro et al. (26Kumashiro K.K. Schmidt-Rohr K. Murphy O.J. Ouellette K.L. Cramer W.A. Thompson L.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5043-5051Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Huster et al. (27Huster D. Yao X.L. Hong M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The rate of magnetization transfer (Ω = D/r2) is a function of the distance (r) between protons and the diffusion coefficient (D). For a given spin (i) in a one-dimensional lattice, the magnetization buildup is given by the following discrete diffusion equation: ΔMi/Δt = –2ΩMi + ΩMi+1 + ΩMi–1. The 1H... 1H distance in the simulations was 2 Å as used by Kumashiro et al. (26Kumashiro K.K. Schmidt-Rohr K. Murphy O.J. Ouellette K.L. Cramer W.A. Thompson L.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5043-5051Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and Huster et al. (27Huster D. Yao X.L. Hong M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the diffusion coefficient (D) was smaller, consistent with the much more fluid membranes used in our studies. We chose eight steps to model the transfer from the aromatic ring protons in phenylalanine methyl ester to the lipid acyl chain protons and varied D to obtain the best fit. The fit is not unique; the simulations presented illustrate the difference between one-step and multistep magnetization transfer. High Resolution MAS NMR of DMPC:DMPG—Fig. 2 presents the two-dimensional MAS 1H NOESY spectrum of DMPC:DMPG multilayers obtained with a mixing time of 300 ms. DMPC and DMPG have comparable phase transition temperatures and are co-miscible. Mixtures of these lipids do not phase-separate (28Contreras L.M. de Almeida R.F.M. Villalain J. Fedorov A. Prieto M. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2273-2283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). At the DMPC:DMPG molar ratio of 100:30 used in our experiments, the net membrane surface charge is comparable to that of the cytoplasmic leaflet of typical mammalian plasma membranes. In the two-dimensional spectrum shown in Fig. 2, the 1H resonances are observed as contours. The resonances on the diagonal correspond to the isotropic 1H resonances that would appear in a conventional one-dimensional NMR spectrum. The most intense diagonal peak at ∼1.3 ppm corresponds to the methylene protons of the lipid acyl chain. Cross-peaks are observed between most of the proton resonances that lie on the diagonal, and their intensities in a NOESY spectrum depend on through-space dipolar couplings. The dipolar couplings and corresponding cross-peak intensities are strong for protons that are in close proximity to one another. Fig. 3A shows 10 slices from the two-dimensional spectrum presented in Fig. 2. The slices are arranged by chemical shift from 5.28 to 0.89 ppm. The resonances are labeled 1–10 according to the labeling in Fig. 1. The diagonal peak in each slice is indicated by an asterisk. The intensities of the cross-peaks are related to the cross-relaxation rate in the NOESY experiment and the NOESY mixing time. The cross-relaxation rate is, in turn, determined by the internuclear distance and by molecular motions. The cross-relaxation rate is increased dramatically for short distances due to the r–6 distance dependence, whereas molecular motions with correlation times of >100 ns (e.g. lateral diffusion) are thought to be the dominant components for mediating relaxation (29Feller S.E. Huster D. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8963-8964Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Fig. 3B shows the slices from the DMPC:DMPG two-dimensional 1H NOESY spectrum collected with a mixing time of 50 ms. The drawback of using very short mixing times is that the intensity for the cross-peaks is smaller than with longer mixing times. The advantage is that these cross-peak intensities provide a more reliable indicator of protons in close proximity because contributions from spin diffusion are less important. In Fig. 3B, the individual slices are plotted such that the diagonal peaks are off-scale and the most intense cross-peak in each slice is roughly full-scale. The one-dimensional slices of the DMPC:DMPG NOESY spectra in Fig. 3 provide a qualitative guide to the location of protons in the lipid membrane because the intensities of the cross-peaks are related to the proximity of neighboring protons. For instance, in Fig. 3A (second spectrum), the resonance at 5.28 ppm corresponds to the proton on C-2 of the glycerol backbone (labeled as 1 in Fig. 1) and exhibits cross-peaks to the other glycerol protons (peaks 2 and 4) and to the choline protons (peaks 3 and 6). These are the protons that are closest in space. There is also a strong cross-peak to the acyl chain protons (peak 9). However, the acyl chain protons are, on average, quite distant from the glycerol protons, and this cross-peak intensity results mainly from spin diffusion. This can be seen in the weaker intensity of the cross-peak (peak 9) at a mixing time of 50 ms (Fig. 3B, second spectrum) compared with the cross-peak at 300 ms (Fig. 3A, second spectrum). In contrast, the terminal methyl resonance at 0.89 ppm exhibits a significant cross-peak to only the acyl chain methylene resonance at 1.3 ppm at both 50 ms (Fig. 3B) and 300 ms (Fig. 3A). There is virtually no cross-relaxation between the terminal methyl protons and protons on the glycerol and choline head group. The distance between the terminal methyl and glycerol protons is considerably longer than the distance between the acyl chain and glycerol protons, and 300 ms is not long enough to allow for magnetization to diffuse along the full length of the lipid acyl chains. Gawrisch and co-workers (30Huster D. Gawrisch K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1992-1993Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Huster D. Arnold K. Gawrisch K. J. Phys. Chem. 1999; 103: 243-251Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have shown that intrachain spin diffusion is slow and generally requires mixing times of >300 ms. The acyl chain protons at positions 7 and 8 in Fig. 1 have resolved chemical shifts at 2.34 and 1.6 ppm, respectively. They show a dominant cross-peak to the main acyl chain resonance at 1.3 ppm and also exhibit weak cross-peaks to the protons of the glycerol backbone, lipid head group, and terminal methyl group with a mixing time of 300 ms. High Resolution MAS NMR of Phenylalanine Methyl Ester— The one-dimensional slices in Fig. 3 provide a qualitative ruler for establishing the depth of peptides in the lipid membrane. If the peptides are buried in the hydrocarbon interior of the membrane, the peptide protons should exhibit cross-peaks predominantly to the protons of the lipid acyl chains, whereas if the peptides are bound in the polar head group region of the bilayer, they should exhibit cross-peaks predominantly to the protons of the glycerol backbone and choline head group. Peptides that bind outside of the polar head group, e.g. polylysine, should exhibit cross-peaks to only the phosphocholine head group. This approach assumes that the mixing times are sufficiently short to limit spin diffusion and that molecular motions of the peptide and lipid allow efficient cross-relaxation. We tested our approach of using peptide-lipid cross-peak intensities as a measure of proximity by obtaining a series of MAS NOESY spectra of phenylalanine methyl ester. This small molecule has a single aromatic ring and a single positive charge on the unprotected amino terminus (see inset to Fig. 5). The hydrophobic phenylalanine side chain has a favorable free energy for partitioning into the head group region, whereas the N-terminal positive charge should be attracted to, but not penetrate, the negatively charged membrane surface (32White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Based on equilibrium dialysis of model tripeptides (e.g. Ala-X-Ala(O-tert-butyl)) with a charged N terminus and a protected C terminus, White and Wimley (32White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar) estimated a free energy of –1.13 kcal/mol for partitioning of the aromatic side chain of Phe into the head group region of POPC. These peptides localize at the membrane interface in the region of the choline head group. Positively charged amino acids, e.g. lysine and arginine, at the X position in these model tripeptides have free energies of approximately +1 kcal/mol for partitioning into the head group region of POPC, suggesting that the positive charge on our phenylalanine methyl ester model compound should not penetrate the phosphocholine region of the bilayer. Fig. 4 presents the two-dimensional MAS 1H NOESY spectrum of phenylalanine methyl ester in DMPC:DMPG multilayers. The spectrum is comparable to that of DMPC:DMPG alone with the exception of the large resonances at 7.30, 7.24, and 7.12 ppm, which are readily assigned to the aromatic protons on the phenylalanine ring. There is also a substantial peak at 4.7 ppm resulting from water protons not removed by proton presaturation. Fig. 5 presents the slices of the aromatic phenylalanine protons from the two-dimensional MAS 1H NOESY spectra of phenylalanine methyl ester obtained with mixing times of 50 and 300 ms. In the 50-ms spectrum, the most intense cross-peaks correspond to the β-protons (4.3 ppm), α-protons (3.7 ppm), and methyl protons (3.2 ppm) of the choline head group. These are positions 3, 5, and 6 in Fig. 1, respectively. The resonance at 3.4 ppm marked with an asterisk results from the β-CH2 group of the phenylalanine side chain. The short (50 ms) mixing time limits spin diffusion, and the spectrum indicates that the aromatic side chain is bound in the region of the choline head group, as expected (Fig. 5A). When the mixing time was increased to 300 ms (Fig. 5B), additional intense resonances occurred at 4.7 and 1.3 ppm, which are assigned to water and the lipid acyl chain CH2 resonances, respectively. The observation of cross-peaks between the aromatic protons of phenylalanine methyl ester and protons on the lipid acyl chains suggests that spin diffusion occurs at longer mixing times. Fig. 6A presents a plot of the intensities of the acyl chain CH2 resonance at 1.3 ppm as a function of the NOESY mixing time. Fig. 6A also presents simulations of magnetization transfer to illustrate how spin diffusion would influence the buildup curves of cross-peak intensity in the NOESY spectrum. The spin diffusion process was simulated using a one-dimensional lattice model (26Kumashiro K.K. Schmidt-Rohr K. Murphy O.J. Ouellette K.L. Cramer W.A. Thompson L.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5043-5051Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Huster D. Yao X.L. Hong M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) with either one step (dashed line) or eight steps (solid line). The rate of magnetization transfer depends on the 1H... 1H distance for each step and the diffusion coefficient. We assumed a 2-Å distance and a diffusion constant of 0.09 Å2/ms (see “Experimental Procedures”). We estimated that approximately eight transfer steps are needed to relay magnetization from the choline head group to the acyl chain protons. The simulations show that, for one step, there is a rapid buildup of intensity that saturates after ∼50–100 ms, whereas for eight steps, magnetization builds up slowly on the last spin in the one-dimensional chain. The NOE buildup curves for the choline methyl protons at 3.2 ppm (Fig. 6B) and for the α-CH2 protons at 4.3 ppm (Fig. 6C) are roughly linear, indicating that these protons are closer in space to the aromatic protons of phenylalanine methyl ester than the acyl chain protons. The slight negative curvature seen in Fig. 6C suggests that the aromatic ring of phenylalanine methyl ester is below the choline methyl protons and near the level of the choline CH2 protons. Together, the NOE buildup curves and simulations support the use of peptide-lipid cross-peak intensities at short mixing times as a measure of proximity. High Resolution MAS NMR of MARCKS-(151–175) Bound to DMPC:DMPG—We performed two-dimensional MAS 1H NOESY experiments with MARCKS-(151–175) bound to DMPC:DMPG bilayers under the same conditions used for the phenylalanine methyl ester experiments. The ratio of DMPC to DMPG was 100:30, and the ratio of peptide to total lipid was ∼1:100. The 1H NOESY spectra of DMPC:DMPG multilayers and phenylalanine methyl ester bound to DMPC:DMPG membranes provide points of reference for comparison. Fig. 7 (A and B) presents the aromatic slices of the twodimensional 1H NOESY spectra of MARCKS-(151–175) obtained with mixing times of 50 and 300 ms, respectively. As for phenylalanine methyl ester, the protons from the aromatic ring of the five Phe residues in MARCKS-(151–175) are easily assigned to"

DTX proteins have a basic N terminus; a central proline-rich region; and a C-terminal RING finger domain, a motif often found in ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3). Recently, we identified and characterized a unique diffuse large B-cell lymphoma risk-related gene named BAL (B aggressive lymphoma). Using a yeast two-hybrid screen for BAL-binding partners, we have now identified a novel protein termed BBAP (B-lymphoma- and BAL-associated protein). Although BBAP has a unique N terminus, the C-terminal region is highly homologous to that of DTX family members. Herein, we report that BBAP and the human family of DTX proteins (DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3) function as E3 ligases based on their capacity for self-ubiquitination. DTX family members homodimerize and heterodimerize in vivo, suggesting that physical interactions between various DTX family members modify E3 activity and/or substrate availability. Consistent with this idea, BBAP and DTX1 associate via their unique N termini, resulting in enhanced self-ubiquitination.

Mauch P. DeVita V.T. Hellman S. Rosenberg S.A. Cancer Principles & Practices of Oncology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1997: 2165-2220Google Scholar). As part of an effort to identify genes associated with the unique behavior of curable versus fatal DLBCLs, we recently isolated and characterized a gene termed BAL (B aggressive lymphoma) that is more highly expressed in fatal tumors (2Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BAL is a nuclear protein with a unique C terminus and a duplicated N-terminal domain homologous to the non-histone region of histone macro-H2A (2Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R.

We employed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify a BAL-binding protein termed BBAP (B-lymphoma- and BAL-associated protein), described herein.

Of particular interest, DTX1 appears to promote B-cell development at the expense of T-cell development (11Izon D.J. Aster J.C. He Y. Weng A. Karnell F.G. Patriub V. Xu L. Bakkour S. Rodriguez C. Allman D. Pear W.S.

How DTX influences B-cell development and transformation, as well as other diverse phenotypes, is not understood. Drosophila DTX and human DTX1 include a basic N terminus, which binds the ankyrin repeats of intracellular Notch; a central proline-rich region; and a C-terminal RING finger domain (5Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1995; 121: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Matsuno K. Eastman D. Mitsiades T. Quinn A.M. Carcanciu M.L. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The RING finger consensus sequence has eight conserved cysteines and histidines that coordinate two zinc ions in a “cross-braced” fashion (14Saurin A.J. Borden K.L. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Recently, certain RING finger proteins were found to be ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases (E3) that mediate the transfer of ubiquitin to themselves and specific heterologous substrates (15Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 16Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The multistep process of ubiquitination is hierarchical, beginning with an initial activation and transfer of ubiquitin from a common ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2). Thereafter, a given E2 interacts with a specific substrate and E3, which catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate (18Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Although polyubiquitinated proteins are often targeted for proteasomal degradation, ubiquitination regulates additional cellular functions that are not directly related to proteasomal degradation (19Pickart C.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 499-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Given the possible roles of DTX family members in B-lineage commitment and transformation, we systematically evaluated BBAP and human DTX family members for E3 activity and heterodimerization. We found that all members of this group are E3 ligases and that heterodimerization of BBAP and DTX1 enhances this activity. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The C-terminal half (aa 486–854) (2Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of BAL was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Plasmids encoding candidate BAL-binding proteins were rescued and confirmed by retransformation. Inserts from positive clones were sequenced, leading to identification of a partial cDNA encoding a novel BAL-binding protein, BBAP. A full-length BBAP cDNA was identified in an activated B-cell plasmid library (20Freedman A.S. Freeman G. Horowitz J.C. Daley J. Nadler L.M. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3260-3267PubMed Google Scholar) with a 5′ BBAP 400-bp biotinylated probe using the ClonCapture library selection kit (Clontech). Cloning of Human DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3—Human DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR. Human DTX2 PCR primers were designed from the sequences of mouse dtx2 (NCBI accession number AB015423), mouse dtx2ΔE (NCBI accession number AB015424), and human KIAA1528 (NCBI accession number AB040961) and human genome sequence (NCBI accession number NT_007834). Human DTX3 PCR primers were designed according to the mouse dtx3 sequence (NCBI accession number AB015425) and human genome sequence (NCBI accession number NT_009410). All human dTX PCR products (DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3) were subcloned into the pCR4 Blunt-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. Cell Culture—Human DLBCL cell lines (DHL-4, -6, -7, -8, and -10), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids and Transfection—Full-length BBAP, N-terminal BBAP (aa 1–560), C-terminal BBAP (aa 528–740), and full-length human DTX2A and DTX2B cDNAs were subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) and HA-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) vectors. Full-length human DTX1 cDNA with a C-terminal Myc tag (a gift from Dr. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas) was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). Full-length human DTX3 was subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 and HA-tagged pHM6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) vectors. Full-length BAL, N-terminal BAL (aa 1–464), and C-terminal BAL (aa 465–854) were subcloned into pFLAG-CMV2 vectors. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HA-tagged Ubc4; Myc-tagged UbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c; and FLAG-tagged UbcH6 and UbcH7 were gifts from Dr. Keiji Tanaka (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science and Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan) (21Shimura H. Hattori N. Kubo S. Mizuno Y. Asakawa S. Minoshima S. Shimizu N. Iwai K. Chiba T. Tanaka K. Suzuki T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 302-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar). Transient transfections of 293 cells were performed using the above-mentioned expression plasmids and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—After ≈48 h of transfection, 293 cells were lysed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Following centrifugation and preclearing of cell lysates with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the supernatants were subsequently incubated with the appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose. Immune complexes were washed, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 95 °C, size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Membranes were immunostained with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies and developed using a chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies—The murine anti-BBAP monoclonal antibody (clone 28F-3E1) was generated following repetitive immunization with purified BBAP-GST fusion protein according to standard protocols. The previously described rabbit anti-BAL polyclonal antibody (2Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was affinitypurified according to standard protocols. The following antibodies were purchased from the indicated commercial sources: mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Sigma), mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 and mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody B-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance Research Products, Richmond, CA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences). In Vivo Ubiquitination Assay—HA-tagged ubiquitin plasmids were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged BBAP or DTX plasmid into 293 cells. Forty hours later, cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) at a final concentration of 25 μm for an additional 6 h. FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and immunostained using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibody. Recombinant Protein Preparation—FLAG-tagged wild-type BBAP and Myc-tagged DTX1, DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3 cDNAs were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 vectors (Amersham Biosciences). A FLAG-tagged RING finger deletion mutant of BBAP, BBAPRFdel, was generated by two-step PCR. In the first step, full-length BBAP cDNA was used as a template to generate two separate products, BBAP-(1–560) and BBAP-(600–740), using the appropriate primers (the BBAP N-terminal primer and 5′-ctggatgcccttttccttcttgtccagttctgaggc-3′ or the BBAP C-terminal primer with FLAG sequence and 5′-gacaagaaggaaaagggcatccagacttcctatggtattcagaaagg-3′) with overlapping ends (underlined). Two PCR products were purified, mixed, and used as templates in the second step, in which BBAP N- and C-terminal FLAG primers were used to amplify BBAPRFdel. The final product was subcloned into the pGEX-4T-2 vector. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Amersham Biosciences) and purified from bacterial cell lysates using standard protocols. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Ubiquitination assays were performed as described previously (22Honda R. Yasuda H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1473-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The standard reaction mixture (50 μl) contained biotinylated ubiquitin (10 μg), rabbit E1 (0.3 μg; Calbiochem), E2 (1 μg), and recombinant BBAP-GST or DTX-GST fusion protein (100–500 ng) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Specific E2 enzymes, including HbcH5a, UbcH5b, and UbcH5c (Boston Biochem, Cambridge, MA), were used in individual assays. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the ubiquitination assay was stopped by adding 2× sample buffer, and samples were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then Western-blotted. Primary antibodies included anti-BBAP, anti-FLAG, anti-Myc, and anti-GST. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, proteins were detected using ECL. Peroxidase-conjugated ExtrAvidin (Sigma) was used for detection of biotinylated ubiquitin. Identification of the BAL-binding Protein BBAP—In a yeast two-hybrid screen using a C-terminal portion of BAL as bait, we identified a novel interacting protein termed BBAP (B-lymphoma- and BAL-associated protein). The full-length BBAP cDNA encodes a 740-aa protein with a unique 560-aa N terminus containing two potential nuclear localization signals (aa 20–26 and 462–478) (23Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar) and a possible nuclear export signal (aa 325–334) (24Bogerd H.P. Fridell R.A. Benson R.E. Hua J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4207-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The BBAP C terminus is highly homologous to the conserved C termini of human DTX1 and the related murine proteins DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3, including a classic RING finger domain (BBAP aa 561–599) (Fig. 1A). BBAP is expressed as a single major transcript of 6.5 kb (data not shown). Confirmation of BAL/BBAP Binding and Identification of the Interaction Domains—To confirm the association between BAL and BBAP, we immunoprecipitated BAL and associated proteins from a panel of DLBCL cell lines. Thereafter, these proteins were size-fractionated and immunoblotted with a newly developed anti-BBAP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B, upper panel) or anti-BAL antiserum (lower panel). The ≈89-kDa BBAP protein was readily detected in BAL immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B, upper panel) in quantities comparable to those of the BAL protein, which has a similar size (lower panel). To identify the domains responsible for BAL/BBAP binding, FLAG-tagged BAL and HA-tagged BBAP constructs were cotransfected into 293 cells and subsequently immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the relevant antibodies. In separate assays, FLAG-tagged full-length, N-terminal, and C-terminal BAL proteins were assessed for association with HA-tagged full-length, N-terminal, and C-terminal BBAP proteins (Fig. 1C). When either FLAG-tagged full-length or C-terminal BAL was immunoprecipitated, full-length or N-terminal BBAP was co-associated with the BAL protein (Fig. 1C, upper left panel, lanes 1, 2, and 5). Similarly, when either HA-tagged full-length or N-terminal BBAP was immunoprecipitated, full-length or C-terminal BAL was co-associated with BBAP (Fig. 1C, lower left panel, lanes 1, 2, and 5). In contrast, neither the N-terminal BAL nor the C-terminal BBAP polypeptide coprecipitated with their respective partner proteins (Fig. 1C, upper and lower left panels, lanes 3 and 4), although these proteins were readily detectable in transfected cells (upper right panel, lane 8; and lower right panel, lane 9). Taken together, these data confirm that BAL and BBAP co-associate in vivo and identify the BBAP N terminus (Fig. 1A) and the BAL C terminus (2Aguiar R.C. Yakushijin Y. Kharbanda S. Salgia R. Fletcher J.A. Shipp M.A. Blood. 2000; 96: 4328-4334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as the interaction domains. DTX Family Members and BBAP—Although the N-terminal BBAP interaction domain is unique, the C terminus of BBAP is highly homologous to those of human DTX1 (7Matsuno K. Eastman D. Mitsiades T.

Genet. 1998; 19: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and the recently described murine family members DTX1, DTX2, DTX2ΔE, and DTX3 (6Kishi N. Tang Z. Maeda Y. Hirai A. Mo R. Ito M.

To analyze the function of the conserved C-terminal BBAP/DTX domain, we first cloned and characterized the human homologs of murine DTX2, DTX2ΔE, and DTX3, hereafter termed DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3, respectively (Fig. 2). Human DTX family members have three distinct domains based on the analogous functional motifs in Drosophila DTX (5Matsuno K. Diederich R.J. Go M.J. Blaumueller C.M. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Development. 1995; 121: 2633-2644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Matsuno K. Eastman D. Mitsiades T. Quinn A.M. Carcanciu M.L. Ordentlich P. Kadesch T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal domain 1 can associate with Notch ankyrin repeats, whereas domain 2 contains a proline-rich region with potential SH3 (Src homology-3) domain-binding sites. The C-terminal domain 3 includes a classic RING finger domain and the region of BBAP homology (Fig. 2A). Human DTX1, DTX2A, and DTX2B are similarly organized, although DTX2B lacks the fourth of nine predicted DTX2 exons (NCBI accession number NT_007833.10) within the proline-rich domain 2. The N-terminal regions of human DTX1, DTX2A, and DTX2B and Drosophila DTX all contain two WWE motifs, a postulated protein/protein interaction domain (25Aravind L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 273-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). DTX3 has a truncated domain 1 that lacks homology to other DTX family members, but retains a proline-rich region (Fig. 2A). As noted, the unique BBAP N terminus does not contain the WWE and proline-rich domains of DTX family members (Fig. 2A). The amino acid sequences of the highly conserved C termini of BBAP, human DTX family members, and Drosophila DTX are aligned in Fig. 2B. Each of these proteins includes a classic RING finger domain of either the RING-H2 or RING-HC sub-type (26Freemont P.S. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R84-R87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DTX1, DTX2, and Drosophila DTX have RING-H2 fingers with histidines in the fourth and fifth positions; in contrast, DTX3 and BBAP contain RING-HC fingers with a single histidine in the fourth position (Fig. 2B). Of interest, the additional C-terminal sequences of the RING-HC-containing DTX3 and BBAP proteins are also more similar to each other than to those of the other RING-H2-containing DTX family members (DTX1, DTX2, and Drosophila DTX) (Fig. 2B). E3 Activity of BBAP—Certain RING finger proteins function as E3 ligases, mediating the transfer of ubiquitin to heterologous substrates and to the RING finger proteins themselves (17Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). To determine whether BBAP functions as an E3, we performed ubiquitination assays in cultured cells. In brief, FLAG-tagged BBAP and HA-tagged ubiquitin were cotransfected into 293 cells, and proteasome activity was inhibited with MG-132. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (BBAP) antibody, size-fractionated, and immunoblotted with anti-HA (ubiquitin) antibody (Fig. 3A, left panel) or anti-FLAG antibody (right panel). The cotransfection of BBAP and ubiquitin resulted in a dramatic increase in high molecular mass polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 3A, left panel), suggesting that BBAP increased ubiquitination and was a possible target for self-ubiquitination. To directly assess the E3 activity of BBAP, we performed in vitro assays in which self-ubiquitination of recombinant BBAP protein was determined. In the presence of E1, E2, and ubiquitin, recombinant BBAP was heavily polyubiquitinated, confirming that it functions as an E3 capable of self-ubiquitination in vitro (Fig. 3B). To determine the role of the RING finger domain in BBAP E3 activity, we performed additional in vitro ubiquitination assays using either the wild-type recombinant BBAP protein or a RING finger deletion mutant (BBAPRFdel) and the required additional components (E1, E2, and biotinylated ubiquitin) (Fig. 3C). Whereas wild-type BBAP exhibited obvious E3 activity, BBAPRFdel was inactive (Fig. 3C), confirming that the RING finger domain is required for BBAP E3 function. Each E3 recognizes specific substrates in cooperation with a common E1 and a smaller subset of E2 enzymes (18Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). To identify the preferred E2 for BBAP, we first analyzed the coprecipitation of BBAP and individual E2 enzymes (Ubc4, UbcH5a, UbcH5b, UbcH5c, UbcH6, and UbcH7) in transiently transfected 293 cells (Fig. 4A, left panels). Although each of these E2 proteins was expressed at readily detectable levels in whole cell lysates from transfected cells (Fig. 4A, upper right panels), BBAP co-immunoprecipitated only with UbcH5 family members (left panels). Thereafter, we evaluated the E2 activity of UbcH5 family members for BBAP using recombinant enzymes in an in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 4B). Although each UbcH5 enzyme was active in this assay, the most striking high molecular mass polyubiquitination occurred when the E2 enzyme UbcH5a was used with BBAP (Fig. 4B). E3 Activities of DTX1, DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3—Given the high degree of C-terminal homology between BBAP and human DTX family members, we next investigated whether DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3 also function as E3 ligases using tagged recombinant DTX-GST fusion proteins in the in vitro ubiquitination assay (Fig. 5). As indicated, DTX1, DTX2A, DTX2B, and DTX3 all exhibited E3 activity as assessed by self-ubiquitination (Fig. 5, A–C). Like BBAP, the DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3 E3 ligases also functioned most efficiently in conjunction with the UbcH5a E2 enzyme (data not shown). BBAP Homodimerizes and Interacts with DTX through Its Unique N Terminus—The BBAP RING finger E3 protein was initially identified on the basis of its N-terminal interaction with BAL (Fig. 1C). Additional RING finger proteins, including DTX family members (6Kishi N. Tang Z. Maeda Y. Hirai A. Mo R. Ito M. Suzuki S. Nakao K. Kinoshita T. Kadesch T. Hui C. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Okano H. Matsuno K. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Inagaki F. Kawaichi M. Fukamizu A. Kishi N. Matsuno K. Nakamura K. Weinmaster G.

Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Okano H. Development. 2002; 129: 1049-1059PubMed Google Scholar), have been reported to dimerize in ways that alter their biological activity. For these reasons, we investigated whether BBAP might homodimerize or heterodimerize with other DTX family members. In initial experiments, FLAG-tagged wild-type BBAP and HA-tagged wild-type, N-terminal, and C-terminal BBAP polypeptides were coexpressed in 293 cells (Fig. 6A, upper and lower panels). FLAG-tagged wild-type BBAP coprecipitated with HA-tagged wild-type and N-terminal BBAP proteins (Fig. 6A, upper left panel), and HA-tagged wild-type and N-terminal BBAP proteins coprecipitated with FLAG-tagged wild-type BBAP (lower left panel). In contrast, C-terminal BBAP did not associate with wild-type BBAP (Fig. 6A, upper and lower left panels), indicating that BBAP homodimerization requires the unique N terminus. To determine whether BBAP also interacts with DTX family members, we coexpressed FLAG-tagged wild-type, N-terminal, and C-terminal BBAP polypeptides and Myc-tagged DTX1 in 293 cells (Fig. 6B, upper and lower panels). FLAG-tagged wild-type and N-terminal BBAP proteins coprecipitated with Myc-tagged wild-type DTX1 (Fig. 6B, upper left panel); similarly, Myc-tagged DTX1 coprecipitated with wild-type and N-terminal (but not C-terminal) BBAP proteins (lower left panel). Taken together, these data demonstrate that BBAP/DTX1 heterodimerization also requires the unique BBAP N terminus. DTX1 Enhances BBAP Ubiquitination—BBAP functions as an E3 via its DTX-homologous C-terminal RING finger domain and interacts with DTX1 via its unique N terminus, suggesting that BBAP/DTX1 binding may have functional consequences. To address this possibility, we compared the self-ubiquitination activity of BBAP in the presence and absence of DTX1 (Fig. 7). Myc-tagged DTX1-GST protein was added to FLAG-tagged wild-type BBAP-GST or BBAPRFdel-GST protein (Fig. 7); wild-type BBAP protein was also incubated separately. Thereafter, the additional required components (E1, E2, and biotinylated ubiquitin) were added, and samples were size-fractionated and serially immunoblotted with anti-FLAG (BBAP) antibody and peroxidase-conjugated avidin (ubiquitin) (Fig. 7). In this assay, wild-type BBAP underwent the expected polyubiquitination, whereas BBAPRFdel did not (Fig. 7, left panel, lanes 1 and 4). In comparison with the wild-type BBAP homodimer, the wild-type BBAP/DTX1 heterodimer exhibited increased BBAP polyubiquitination (Fig. 7, left and right panels, lanes 1 versus lanes 3). Taken together, these data indicate that the BBAP/DTX1 heterodimer is a better E3 and substrate for self-ubiquitination compared with the BBAP homodimer. We have cloned and characterized the BAL-binding protein BBAP, which has highly significant C-terminal homology to DTX family members. However, in contrast to DTX family members, BBAP includes a unique N terminus and lacks a central proline-rich region. The BBAP and DTX C termini contain classic RING-HC or RING-H2 finger domains. Using in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays, we have shown that BBAP functions as an E3 and promotes its self-ubiquitination in a RING finger-dependent manner. In analogous ubiquitination assays, we demonstrated that DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3 also function as E3 ligases. In additional binding studies, DTX1 and BBAP formed heterodimers via their respective N termini in a manner that enhanced BBAP-mediated self-ubiquitination. In lymphoid progenitors, DTX acts as a negative modulator of Notch signaling (11Izon D.J. Aster J.C. He Y. Weng A. Karnell F.G. Patriub V. Xu L. Bakkour S. Rodriguez C. Allman D. Pear W.S. Immunity. 2002; 16: 231-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, the observed differences in DTX activity in certain in vitro and in vivo assays suggest that DTX function may be dose- and cell type-dependent and tightly regulated. For these reasons, the identification of DTX family members as E3 ligases and targets for self-ubiquitination is of particular interest. Recent studies highlight the pivotal role of ubiquitination in regulating Notch-mediated signaling (28Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R74-R78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Four known E3 ligases regulate Notch itself, Notch ligands, or known Notch antagonists (28Lai E.C. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R74-R78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). That DTX family members also function as E3 ligases further emphasizes the role of ubiquitination in regulating Notch signaling. The striking C-terminal homology between BBAP and human DTX family members prompted our analysis of their common functions. However, the BBAP C terminus is more closely related to the DTX3 C terminus than to the DTX1 and DTX2 C termini. Of interest, neither BBAP nor DTX3 contains the DTX1/2 N terminus, which physically interacts with Notch ankyrin repeats, suggesting that BBAP and DTX3 have unique functions that are not shared by DTX1 and DTX2. Given the demonstrated role of the BBAP N terminus as an interaction domain (Figs. 1C and 6), BBAP may have additional unique binding partners. Nevertheless, previous murine studies indicate that DTX1, DTX2, and DTX3 form homo- and heterodimers (6Kishi N. Tang Z. Maeda Y. Hirai A. Mo R. Ito M. Suzuki S. Nakao K. Kinoshita T. Kadesch T. Hui C. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Okano H. Matsuno K. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 2001; 19: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, heterodimeric RING finger protein complexes have been associated with increased functional activity. For example, the heterodimeric complex containing the BRCA1 tumor suppressor and BARD1 exhibits increased E3 activity (29Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H. Oyake D. Yabuki Y. Ogata H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14537-14540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 30Chen A. Kleiman F.E. Manley J.L. Ouchi T. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22085-22092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Similarly, the complex containing two different negative regulators of p53, Mdm2 and MdmX, has increased E3 activity (31Badciong J.C. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49668-49675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). That BBAP/DTX1 heterodimers exhibit increased E3 activity is consistent with these observations. However, unlike the Mdm2 and MdmX proteins, which interact via their respective RING finger domains (32Tanimura S. Ohtsuka S. Mitsui K. Shirouzu K. Yoshimura A. Ohtsubo M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), BBAP binds to DTX1 via its unique N terminus. In our studies, a C-terminal BBAP construct containing the RING finger did not bind full-length DTX1 or BBAP. Therefore, other protein interaction domains could be responsible for the heterodimerization of certain RING finger-containing proteins and the consequent increase in E3 activity. Because BBAP also interacts with the BAL protein via its unique N terminus, the functional consequences of this interaction are of great interest. Although BBAP is clearly an E3, BAL has not yet been identified as a substrate for BBAP-mediated ubiquitination. Given the relevance of the DTX family of proteins in the control of several critical cellular mechanisms, the demonstration of their E3 activity is important. This newly identified function, as well as the role of DTX1 in modulating BBAP E3 activity, should be taken in consideration when studying the effects of these proteins in vivo. We thank Drs. Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas and Keiji Tanaka for providing reagents, Hideyo Yasuda for technical advice, and Alan D'Andrea for helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W1998553000,"Mammalian Enabled (Mena) is a mammalian homologue of <i>Drosophila</i> Enabled (Ena), which genetically interacts with <i>Drosophila</i> Abl tyrosine kinase. The signaling pathway involving c-Abl and Mena (Ena) is not fully understood. To find molecules that participate in the c-Abl/Mena pathway, we searched for Mena-binding proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. We identified Abl interactor 1 (Abi-1), which is known to interact with c-Abl, as a binding protein for Mena. Binding analysis revealed that the Ena/Vasp homology 1 domain of Mena and the polyproline structure of Abi-1 are necessary for the interaction. The interaction between Mena and Abi-1 was also observed in a mammalian expression system. Importantly, Abi-1 dramatically promoted c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Mena but not other substrates such as c-Cbl. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the phosphorylation site of Mena is Tyr-296. Our results suggest that Abi-1 regulates c-Abl-mediated phosphorylation of Mena by interacting with both proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1989170923,"Classic cadherins are adhesion-activated cell signaling receptors. In particular, homophilic cadherin ligation can directly activate Rho family GTPases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), signaling molecules with the capacity to support the morphogenetic effects of these adhesion molecules during development and disease. However, the molecular basis for cadherin signaling has not been elucidated, nor is its precise contribution to cadherin function yet understood. One attractive hypothesis is that cadherin-activated signaling participates in stabilizing adhesive contacts (Yap, A. S., and Kovacs, E. M. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 160, 11–16). We now report that minimal mutation of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail to uncouple binding of p120-ctn ablated the ability of E-cadherin to activate Rac. This was accompanied by profound defects in the capacity of cells to establish stable adhesive contacts, defects that were rescued by sustained Rac signaling. These data provide direct evidence for a role of cadherin-activated Rac signaling in contact formation and adhesive stabilization. In contrast, cadherin-activated PI3-kinase signaling was not affected by loss of p120-ctn binding. The molecular requirements for E-cadherin to activate Rac signaling thus appear distinct from those that stimulate PI3-kinase, and we postulate that p120-ctn may play a central role in the E-cadherin-Rac signaling pathway.

Classic cadherins are fundamental determinants of morphogenesis and tissue patterning (1Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar, 2Tepass U. Troung K. Godt D. Ikura M. Peifer M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Cadherins function as membrane-spanning macromolecular complexes: the cadherin ectodomains engage in adhesive binding whereas the cytoplasmic tails associate with a variety of proteins that potentially allow cadherins to interact with the actin cytoskeleton and cell signaling pathways (3Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). A deep understanding of how cadherins exert their morphogenetic effects must explain how adhesive engagement of the cadherin ectodomain is translated into changes in cellular behavior, particularly productive adhesion and cell-cell recognition. An important advance comes from the recent discovery that classical cadherins function as adhesion-activated cell signaling receptors (4Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

These signals have the potential to allow cadherin engagement to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and the cadherin/catenin apparatus, thereby translating adhesive recognition into changes in cell shape and surface adhesion. In particular, Rac activity is consistently stimulated as an early-immediate response to cadherin ligation (4Noren N.K. Niessen C.M. Gumbiner B.M. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33305-33308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for cadherin-activated Rac signaling remains to be elucidated, and the biological significance of direct cadherin signaling is not thoroughly understood. Although recent data point to a role in adhesive recognition and strengthening (reviewed in Ref. 9Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), both Rac and PI3-kinase signals can have more diverse targets that include transcriptional regulation and control of cell population dynamics (10Symons M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 178-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 11Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). Indeed, although it is attractive to postulate that cadherin-activated signaling might support adhesive contact formation, this notion has not yet been directly tested. In this study we sought to pursue the functional significance of E-cadherin-activated cell signaling. We focused on the potential role of p120-ctn binding in this process, based on data suggesting that p120-ctn might provide insights into the relationship between cadherin signaling and adhesion. p120-ctn is an armadillo family protein that associates directly with the membrane-proximal region of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail (12Anastasiadis P.Z. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1319-1334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the cytoplasmic tail to eliminate p120-ctn binding revealed an important contribution of this catenin to cadherin adhesion, albeit with complex effects. In several instances, loss of the capacity to bind p120-ctn reduced cadherin adhesion (13Yap A.S. Niessen C. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), but in other cases, actual potentiation of adhesion was observed (15Ohkubo T. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21409-21415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Some of these discrepancies may reflect differences in the cadherin studied, the cell types utilized, and the potential for other proteins to interact with the membrane-proximal region of the cytoplasmic tail. The molecular basis for these functional effects remains unknown. When overexpressed in the cytoplasm p120-ctn can also affect signaling by Rho GTPases (16Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Noren N.K. Liu B.P. Burridge K. Kreft B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). In cadherin-expressing cells, however, p120-ctn is principally found associated with cadherins at the plasma membrane (14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar); what role p120-ctn may play in cadherin signaling thus remains unclear. As a first step in assessing this issue, we now report that a minimal mutation in the cytoplasmic tail that abolishes the association of p120-ctn inhibits the ability of E-cadherin to signal to Rac but does not affect its ability to activate PI3-kinase. Analysis of this mutant provides direct evidence for the central role of cadherin-activated signaling in adhesion and cell recognition. Cell Lines and Plasmids—hE-CHO cells stably expressing wild-type human E-cadherin were prepared as described previously (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

The CHO cell lines used in this study do not express any detectable endogenous classical cadherins (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Latex beads (6.2 μm; Sigma) were initially coated with Protein A (0.1 μg/μl). Both latex beads and substrata were blocked in bovine serum albumin (10 mg/ml) before assays. For adhesion assays, cells were isolated to preserve the cellular cadherins as described previously (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

After attachment to hE/Fc-coated substrata, cells were detached by pipetting, and cells that remained attached were counted and expressed as a percentage of the number of cells attached before pipetting. Cells transiently expressing GFP-L61Rac or GFP alone were identified by GFP fluorescence. Immunofluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Images were acquired by epillumination using an Olympus AX70 microscope and Hamamatsu Orca1 camera or with Bio-Rad MRC 600 or Radiance confocal microscopes. Image analysis was performed using Metamorph 4.5 digital analysis software (Universal Imaging). Protein recruitment to latex beads was measured by obtaining the average pixel intensity of fluorescence in the immediate region surrounding a bead normalized to the average pixel intensity in an area of equal size on the free cell surface away from the region of the bead. The -fold increase in pixel intensity for each condition was determined by the mean -fold increase from 18 to 25 beads. Only beads showing clear recruitment of cadherin were analyzed. PAK-CRIB Pulldown Assays—GTP-bound Rac was measured in cells attached to hE/Fc using a PAK-CRIB GST fusion protein as described previously (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Briefly, PAK-CRIB GST fusion protein (a kind gift of Dr. Jonathan Chernoff, Fox Chase) was purified from DH5α Escherichia coli using glutathione agarose (Scientifix) and 50 μg of PAK-CRIB GST fusion protein incubated with each lysate sample. Affinity precipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for Rac1. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—To identify activated Akt, cells were serum-starved by incubation for 48 h in media containing 0.2% fetal calf serum and then chilled on ice and lysed by mechanical shearing in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm KOAc, 1 mm MgOAc, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were briefly spun at 3000 rpm for 3 min, and the post-nuclei supernatant was collected and then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm (1 h, 4 °C). The membrane fraction was collected and then resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA). Akt was immunoprecipitated with an Akt antibody for 1 h (1:100; Cell Signaling Technologies), and immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with Akt or activation-specific phospho-Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies). Other standard biochemistry was performed as described previously (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As a first step to analyzing the molecular basis of cadherin signaling, we utilized a minimal E-cadherin mutant (hE-764AAA) that contains three sequential point mutations (EED to AAA) that effectively ablated binding of p120-ctn to E-cadherin in A431D cells (14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z.

We stably expressed hE-764AAA in Chinese hamster ovary cells (hE764-CHO cells) and chose clones that displayed surface levels of mutant protein similar to CHO cell lines stably expressing wild-type E-cadherin (hE-CHO cells; see Fig. 1A). In both hE-CHO cells and in hE764-CHO cells the majority of cellular cadherin was found at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). As observed previously in A431D cells (14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), in contrast to wild-type E-cadherin, the hE-764AAA mutant did not recruit endogenous p120-ctn to cell-cell contacts (Fig. 1B) nor did it co-immunoprecipitate with p120-ctn (Fig. 1C). However, the hE-764AAA mutant efficiently co-immunoprecipitated β-catenin and recruited this protein to cell-cell contacts as predicted, because the minimal mutation does not affect the β-catenin binding site. The hE-764AAA Mutation Is Associated with Defects in Adhesion and Contact Zone Extension—To assess the specific functional consequences of this cadherin mutation, we utilized a reductionist assay that exploits the ability of purified recombinant proteins incorporating the entire cadherin ectodomain to engage the ectodomains of cellular cadherins (4Noren N.K.

We used a fusion protein consisting of the ectodomain of human E-cadherin expressed as a constitutive dimer fused to the Fc portion of IgG (hE/Fc). Immobilized hE/Fc induces cadherin clustering, supports adhesion, and directly activates signaling by the Rac GTPase (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), thereby allowing cadherin-specific cellular sequelae to be isolated. An important sign of productive cadherin-based cell recognition is the rapid conversion of limited, nascent contacts into broad zones of adhesion (8Ehrlich J.S. Hansen M.D.H. Nelson W.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 23Vasioukhin V. Bauer C. Yin M. Fuchs E. Cell. 2000; 100: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). This process of contact zone extension is also represented by the characteristically large lamellipodial extensions that cadherin-expressing cells make when they adhere to hE/Fc-coated substrata (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 18Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We found that, although weakly adhesive (Fig. 2C) (14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), hE764-CHO cells attached to hE/Fc-coated substrata. However, whereas hE-CHO cells rapidly extended numerous broad cadherin-based lamellipodia (Fig. 2, A and B), hE764-CHO cells characteristically formed spindle-shaped cells, with very limited lamellipodial protrusions (Fig. 2, A and B). Phase contrast videomicroscopy revealed that as hE-CHO cells attached to hE/Fc they initially extended numerous small protrusions, which reinforced into a few dominant lamellipodia after ∼45 min (Fig. 2A). In contrast, hE764-CHO cells continuously formed labile extensions that did not reinforce into any dominant lamellipodia (Fig. 2A). This was further reflected by changes in cell adhesion, as measured by the resistance of cells to detachment from hE/Fc-coated substrata. As shown in Fig. 2C, cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin increased adhesion rapidly upon attachment to hE/Fc, whereas parental CHO cells bound poorly. hE764-CHO cells adhered to hE/Fc but always much more weakly than hE-CHO cells. This is consistent with earlier studies that reported a positive role for p120-ctn in cadherin adhesion (13Yap A.S. Niessen C. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 14Thoreson M.A. Anastasiadis P.Z. Daniel J.M. Ireton R.C. Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Hummingbird D.K. Reynolds A.B. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30965-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The Functional Defects Associated with the hE-764AAA Mutation Are Rescued by Rac Signaling—We observed recently (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) that Rac signaling was essential for cells to effectively extend cadherin-based lamellipodia in these planar adhesion assays. The inability of hE764-CHO cells to form lamellipodia thus suggested that the functional defects associated with the hE-764AAA mutation might be due to changes in Rac signaling. As a first test of this notion, we asked whether restoration of Rac signaling could affect cadherin-based lamellipodial formation in hE764-CHO cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, we found that expression of constitutively active V12-Rac induced hE764-CHO cells to form extensive, nearly circumferential, lamellipodia upon hE/FC-coated substrata, to a similar extent as occurred when V12-Rac was expressed in wild-type hE-CHO cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore provision of Rac signaling could restore the ability of hE764-CHO cells to support robust adhesive contact formation. In contrast, cadherin-based lamellipodial formation in hE764-CHO cells was not rescued by expression of constitutively active or dominant-negative mutants of RhoA or Cdc42 or by dominant-negative Rac (not shown). Importantly, restoration of Rac signaling by expression of GFP-L61Rac also stimulated adhesion pronouncedly in hE764-CHO cells (Fig. 2C), whereas expression of GFP alone had no significant effect. Taken together, these data suggested that alterations in Rac signaling might be implicated in the functional consequences of the hE-764AAA mutation. The hE-764AAA Mutation Does Not Activate Rac Signaling— Productive cadherin ligation recruits Rac to sites of adhesive contact (reviewed in Ref. 9Yap A.S. Kovacs E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test whether direct cadherin-activated signaling was altered by the hE-764AAA mutation, we first examined whether the ability of E-cadherin to recruit Rac to adhesion sites was affected by this mutation (Fig. 3). We found that latex beads coated with hE/Fc effectively adhered to the dorsal surfaces of hE-CHO cells. Cellular E-cadherin characteristically accumulated at the regions where beads bound (Fig. 3A), and transiently expressed GFP-Rac1 was efficiently recruited to these sites of homophilic E-cadherin adhesion, appearing as distinct bands of fluorescence immediately around the beads (Fig. 3B). In contrast, GFP-Rac1 was not recruited to sites of adhesion with beads coated with either concanavalin A (ConA; see Fig. 3E) or poly-l-lysine (not shown), excluding the possibility that Rac recruitment was a nonspecific response to bead adhesion. GFP alone did not accumulate around beads coated with hE/Fc (Fig. 3F), indicating that Rac1 accumulation was not because of an edge artifact. In contrast to hE-CHO cells, hE764-CHO cells failed to recruit Rac to sites of adhesion. As shown in Fig. 3C, hE/Fc-coated beads accumulated hE-764AAA at sites of adhesion, but this was not accompanied by any localized recruitment of GFP-Rac1 above the levels expressed on the free cell surface away from the adhesive contacts (Fig. 3D). Indeed, when quantitated by digital image analysis, the recruitment of GFP-Rac1 to hE/Fc beads in hE764-CHO cells was identical to that of GFP-Rac1 to ConA beads in hE-CHO cells (Fig. 3G). This suggested that the 764AAA mutation effectively abrogated the ability of E-cadherin to recruit Rac1 to sites of cell adhesion. This disparity in recruitment of GFP-Rac1 to sites of adhesion was accompanied by a marked difference in the ability of homophilic ligation to activate endogenous Rac1 signaling. As shown in Fig. 4, adhesion of hE-CHO cells to planar substrata coated with hE/Fc induced a rapid rise in cellular GTP-Rac, measured by affinity isolation assays using a GST fusion protein containing the RBD/CRIB domain from PAK (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no rise in GTP-Rac was detected as hE764-CHO cells attached to hE/Fc-coated substrata (Fig. 4A), nor was any activation detected in hE-CHO cells plated onto poly(l-lysine) (not shown) (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Although p120-ctn displays a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor-like activity for Rho in vitro (16Anastasiadis P.Z. Moon S.Y. Thoreson M.A. Mariner D.J. Crawford H.C. Zheng Y. Reynolds A.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), we found that PMA stimulated Rac activation to a comparable extent in both hE764-CHO cells and wild-type hE-CHO cells (Fig. 4B). Therefore failure of the hE-764AAA mutant to activate Rac in response to homophilic ligation cannot be because of a generalized inhibition of Rac competence by cytoplasmic p120-ctn. To further assess the ability of cadherin ligation to activate potential signals downstream of Rac, we examined the recruitment of PAK1 to sites of cadherin adhesion (Fig. 5). PAK1 is a well characterized effector of Rac signaling that is recruited to the membrane upon activation of Rac (25Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that endogenous PAK1 (Fig. 5B) accumulated with wild-type E-cadherin (Fig. 5A) at sites of adhesion to hE/Fc-coated beads. In contrast, PAK1 was not recruited to sites of contact when the hE-764AAA mutant bound to hE/Fc-coated beads (Fig. 5, C and D). Taking these data together, we conclude that mutation of the p120-ctn binding site rendered E-cadherin incapable of signaling to Rac, blocking recruitment of Rac to sites of adhesion, stimulation of the GTPase itself, and the activation of a potential down-stream signaling pathway. Uncoupling of p120-ctn Binding Does Not Affect Cadherin-activated PI3-kinase Signaling—We then turned to assess whether the ability of E-cadherin to activate PI3-kinase signaling was affected by the hE-764AAA mutation. As with growth factors (26Cantrell D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 114: 1439-1445Crossref Google Scholar), stimulation of PI3-kinase by E-cadherin entails recruitment of PI3-kinase to sites of activated receptors and stimulation of down-stream targets (18Kovacs E.M. Goodwin M. Ali R.G. Paterson A.D. Yap A.S. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 379-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 27Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). We found that hE/Fc beads recruited GFP-p85 to sites of cadherin adhesion in hE-CHO cells (Fig. 6, A and B), corroborating earlier demonstrations that homophilic ligation induces PI3-kinase to interact biochemically with the cadherin-catenin complex (18Kovacs E.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19347-19351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recruitment of GFP-p85 to cadherin-coated beads was not, however, materially altered in hE764-CHO cells (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that this mutation did not affect the ability of E-cadherin to recruit PI3-kinase. To pursue this notion, we then assessed the ability of Akt (protein kinase B) to be recruited to sites of cadherin adhesion (Fig. 7). Akt is a downstream effector of PI3-kinase signaling that translocates to the plasma membrane upon activation of PI3-kinase by growth factors (11Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar), as well as E-cadherin ligation (5Kovacs E.M. Ali R.G. McCormack A.J. Yap A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6708-6718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Consistent with the pattern for GFP-p85, endogenous Akt was recruited to hE/Fc beads both in cells expressing wild-type E-cadherin (Fig. 7, A and B) and in cells expressing the hE-764AAA mutation (Fig. 7, C and D). At the membrane Akt is activated by phosphorylation in a PI3-kinase-dependent fashion (11Downward J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar).

Similar to other members of this family, BTEB1 can act as a transactivator or transrepressor depending on cell and promoter context, although the molecular mechanism underlying these distinct activities remains unclear. Here we report that BTEB1 can mediate signaling pathways involving the nuclear receptor for the steroid hormone progesterone in endometrial epithelial cells by its selective interaction with the progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, PR-A and PR-B. Functional interaction with ligand-activated PR-B resulted in superactivation of PR-B transactivity, facilitated the recruitment of the transcriptional integrator CREB-binding protein within the PR-dimer, and was dependent on the structure of the ligand bound by PR-B.

In the absence of P, the unopposed actions of estrogen can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation at the expense of cellular differentiation, an event highly correlated with the development of endometrial carcinoma (2Inoue M.

The intracellular actions of P are mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (4Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar, 5McKenna N.J. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 465-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar). PR exists as two isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, which are transcribed from a single gene and display similar hormone and DNA binding specificities (6Kastner P. Krust A. Turcotte B. Stropp U. Tora L.

PR-B differs from PR-A by the presence of an additional 164 residues in the amino-terminal region of PR-B, and the two proteins exhibit distinct transcriptional activities as a function of promoter and cellular contexts. In general, PR-B is a stronger transcriptional activator than PR-A (8Leslie K.K. Kumar N.S. Richer J. Owen G. Takimoto G. Horwitz K.B. Lange C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Dahiya R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). Concomitant with a general decrease in the number of endometrial cells expressing PR, a shift in the ratio of PR-A to PR-B, favoring the predominance of PR-A-expressing cells, was noted during the progression of the endometrium from normal to hyperplastic to tumorigenic states (14Arnett-Mansfield R.L. de Fazio A. Wain G.V. Jaworski R.C. Byth K. Mote P.A. Clarke C.L. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4576-4582PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the distinct transcriptional activities of the two PR isoforms is not well understood, although this has been attributed to discrete protein-protein interactions that are mediated by the B-upstream sequence unique to PR-B (15Sartorius C.A. Melville M.Y. Hovland A.R. Tung L. Takimoto G.S. Horwitz K.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In particular, B-upstream sequence has been shown to repress the inhibitory activity of a segment within the N-terminal region of PR-A, which interferes with the activation functions of the AF-1 and AF-2 domains of the PR (16Hovland A.R.

PR-A has also been shown to interact preferentially with co-repressors and less efficiently with co-activators, compared with PR-B (17Giangrande P.H. Kimbrel E.A. Edwards D.P. McDonnell D.P. Mol.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), however, PR-A was demonstrated to positively modulate the transcriptional activity of PR-B on a gene promoter that is induced synergistically by P and cAMP by binding to liver activating protein (LAP), an isoform of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) in human endometrial stromal cells. Thus, promoter as well as cellular context can influence the transcriptional activity of each isoform, and binding to consensus PREs may not be necessarily required for P-responsiveness of target genes (19Owen G.I.

In a previous study, we have defined basic transcription element-binding protein (BTEB1), a member of the Sp/Krüppel-like family (KLF) of transcription factors (21Bieker J.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We also showed that BTEB1 transactivates gene promoters containing GC-rich recognition motifs (25Simmen R.C.M. Chung T.E.

Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but in the presence of ligand-activated PR-B, the functional complex formed between the PR-B dimer and BTEB1 favored the induction of PRE-containing promoters (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because the relative levels of PR-A, PR-B and BTEB1 are tightly regulated in normal uterine endometrium, and deviations in PR isoform ratios can affect tissue responsiveness to P, we examined whether BTEB1 alters the transactivity of PR-A for different promoters. Here we show that BTEB1 has no effect on PR-A transactivation but enhances PR-A-mediated repression of PR-B transcriptional activity. We also demonstrate that BTEB1 cooperates with the transcriptional integrator CREB-binding protein (CBP) (27McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar) in enhancing the transcriptional activities of ligand-bound PR-B and unliganded PR-A, respectively. Further, we identify FKLF2/BTEB3 (28Martin K.M. Cooper W.N. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and Sp1 as functional PR-B transcriptional partners, with BTEB3 closely mimicking the activity of BTEB1. Finally, we provide evidence to suggest that the functional interactions of BTEB1 and PR-B noted from transient transfection studies may be biologically relevant in the context of early pregnancy in the mouse and pig uterus and in the breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and T47D. These results suggest that the selective utilization of BTEB1 and related KLF members by PR isoforms may underlie, in part, the distinct repertoire of progestin-regulated genes mediated by homodimers of PR-A and PR-B as well as by the PR-A/PR-B heterodimer, respectively, in target cells (29Richer J.K.

Rabbit antibodies raised against human Sp1 and human PR were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Type I (ZK98299, onapristone) and type II (RU486, mifepristone) PR antagonists were kindly provided by Dr. Linda Tseng (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). All molecular biology-grade chemicals and solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Plasmid DNAs and Expression Constructs—The DNA constructs used for transient transfection studies were obtained from the following sources: rat BTEB1 in pCDNA3 (Dr. Hiroaki Imataka, McGill University, Quebec); rat PR-B in pCMV5 (Dr. Benita Katzenellenbogen, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL); human Sp1 in pCMV (Dr. Robert Tjian, University of California, Berkeley, CA); human BTEB3 in pCDNA3.1 and pCDNA3.1 empty vector (Dr. An Song, Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA); human PR-A in pm and pVP16, respectively, and pG5CAT (Dr. Dean Edwards, University of Colorado, Denver, CO); human PR-A and -B isoforms in pSG5 vector and mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter construct (Dr. Pierre Chambon, University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France); and CBP in pSG5 (Dr. James Bieker, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY). A luciferase reporter construct (UF-Luc) containing 1143 bp of the 5′ promoter and regulatory region of the P-regulated porcine uteroferrin (UF) gene was previously described (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All plasmid DNAs were prepared using the Maxiprep system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Cell Lines and Culture—The human endometrial carcinoma cell line Hec-1-A, a model of well differentiated carcinoma, was a gift of the late Dr. P. G. Satyaswaroop (Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA) and was routinely cultured in McCoy's 5A in the presence of 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Monkey kidney COS-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) were propagated in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The human mammary carcinoma cell line T47D (ATCC) was maintained in RPMI 1640 containing bovine insulin (0.2 IU/ml) and 10% FBS. The human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 Tet-On cell line (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and its clonal derivatives B5 and C3 that were generated in our laboratory (see “Results”) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% Tet system approved fetal bovine serum (TFBS) and G418 (0.1 μg/ml), following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Transient Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Transfections were carried out using polybrene (Hexadimethrine Bromide, Sigma) for Hec-1-A cells or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) for COS-1 cells, as previously described (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Approximately 6 × 105 cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 h before transfection. Four h after transfection, Hec-1-A cells were treated with 25% Me2SO in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, pH 7.4) for 4 min, washed twice with HBSS, and then incubated for an additional 48 h in fresh McCoy's medium containing charcoal-stripped FBS (10%) in the presence or absence of the synthetic progestin R5020 (100 nm; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). COS-1 cells transiently transfected with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene construct pG5CAT (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and specific combinations of pm-PR-A chimera, pVP16-PR-A chimera, (30Leonhardt S.A. Altmann M. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1914-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and pCDNA-BTEB1 expression vectors (each added at 0.5 μg/well), as well as other constructs (described under “Results”) were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C and then fed fresh medium containing 20% FBS. Eighteen h later, the cells were transferred to charcoal-stripped FBS (10%)-containing medium with no or 100 nm R5020 (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Treated cells were further incubated for 24 h, and Luc or CAT activity was measured on whole cell extracts as previously described (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Results were normalized to total protein content for each sample, as determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218585) Google Scholar), and are presented as least-square means (LSM) ± S.E. Individual transfections were done in triplicate and performed three or four times using cells of comparable passage numbers. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA from cells and uterine endometrial tissues was prepared by the TriZol method. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA and PCR amplifications were performed using commercially available cDNA synthesis and PCR kits (Invitrogen). For PCR analysis, the following primers were used: pig/human progesterone receptor PR (A/B) (sense) 5′-GCTTCAAGTTAGCCAAGAAGAGT-3′ and (antisense) 5′-CTGGAAATTCAACACTCAGTG-3′ (290 bp); pig/human PR-B (sense) 5′-ACACCTTGCCTGAAGTTTCG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TCCAAGACACTGTCCAGCAG-3′ (220 bp); pig β2-microglobulin (sense) 5′-CTGCTCTCACTGTCTGG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-ATCGAGAGTCACGTGCT-3′ (288 bp); pig/human CBP (sense) 5′-AAGCGAAACCAACAAACCAT-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TGTTCGTGCCAGCCTTTCCT-3′ (489 bp); human cyclin D1 (sense) 5′-CTGGCCATGAACTACCTG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-GTCACACTTGATCACTCT-3′ (482 bp); and human β-actin (sense) 5′-TCACCAACTGGGACGACATG-3′ and (antisense) 5′-TCACCGGAGTCCATCACGAT-3′ (243 bp). The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The PR-B and CBP PCR products were transferred to a nylon membrane, which was subsequently hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA fragments of human PR-B or human CBP cDNAs, respectively. The intensities of the ethidium bromide staining (for PR (A/B), β2-microglobulin, cyclin D1, and β-actin) and hybridization signals (for PR-B and CBP) were quantified using microdensitometry. Western Immunoblot and Co-immunoprecipitation Analyses—Nuclear extracts from tissues or cells, prepared following previously described protocols (32Liu S.F. Haddad E.B. Adcock I. Salmon M. Koto H. Gilbey T. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 1241-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Standard Western blot techniques were used to detect the levels of nuclear proteins (PR-A and -B isoforms, BTEB1, and Sp1) using the appropriate primary (1:1000 final dilution for each) and secondary antibodies as previously described (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Simmen R.C.M. Zhang X-L. Zhang D. Wang Y. Michel F.J. Simmen F.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 159: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-rat BTEB1 antibody followed previously described protocols (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Animals and Tissue Isolation—Mice (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) were housed in the animal care facility at the University of Florida in accordance with National Institutes of Health standards for the care and use of experimental animals. Adult females were mated with fertile males of the same strain to induce pregnancy. Day 0.5 of pregnancy was designated as the morning of observing the vaginal plug. Whole uteri were taken at the indicated pregnancy days and frozen for analysis after flushing with PBS. Pig uterine tissues were isolated as described previously (25Simmen R.C.M. Chung T.E. Imataka H. Michel F.J. Badinga L. Simmen F.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All numerical data were compared with appropriate controls and analyzed using ANOVA following the general linear models procedure of the Statistical Analysis System (33SAS Institute The SAS System for Windows. 1999; (Version 8, Cary, NC)Google Scholar). Comparisons between groups were analyzed using predicted differences of the LSM. The statistical model included treatment and experiment, and only preplanned comparisons were made. Treatment means were considered significantly different at p ≤ 0.05. Lack of Functional Interaction of the PR-A Isoform with BTEB1—To investigate whether the PR-A isoform interacts with BTEB1, as was previously demonstrated for PR-B (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), two functional assays involving the quantification of promoter-reporter activities in cells transiently transfected with expression constructs for PR-A and BTEB1 were utilized. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, the full-length PR-A, fused to the Gal4-DNA-binding domain in the pm vector or the activation domain in the pVP16 vector were co-transfected with pG5CAT in the presence or absence of full-length BTEB1 expression construct. Transfected COS-1 cells were then incubated for 24 h in medium containing R5020 (100 nm) in ethanol (vehicle) or vehicle alone. In the absence of BTEB1, the combination of the two PR single hybrids increased basal reporter activity with added R5020, suggesting the formation of a functional PR-A dimer (Fig. 1). BTEB1, however, had no effect on the basal or R5020-stimulated reporter activity in the presence of both PR-A fusion proteins. To determine whether PR-A functionally interacts with BTEB1 within the context of a natural promoter with recognition sequences for both BTEB1 and PR, the UF promoter, which contains functionally responsive sequences for BTEB1 (25Simmen R.C.M. Chung T.E. Imataka H. Michel F.J. Badinga L. Simmen F.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2517-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and PR (34Lamian V. Gonzalez B.Y. Michel F.J. Simmen R.C.M. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 439-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was linked to the Luc reporter gene and used in transient transfections of Hec-1-A cells. As expected, BTEB1 alone increased UF promoter activity (Fig. 2). In the absence of its ligand, PR-A or PR-B decreased basal transcription from the UF promoter-Luc reporter, which was further attenuated with the co-expression of the two isoforms. Ligand-activated PR-B increased transcriptional activity from the reporter, and this was enhanced in the presence of BTEB1 consistent with our previous findings (24Zhang D. Zhang X-L. Michel F.J. Blum J.L. Simmen F.A. Simmen R.C.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 62-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By contrast, ligand-bound PR-A had no effect on this promoter's activity in the presence or absence of BTEB1. Moreover, PR-A inhibited P-dependent PR-B transactivity, and this repression was augmented by BTEB1 (Fig. 2). Results indicate that although BTEB1 preferentially interacts with PR-B homodimer to enhance PR-B transactivation, it acts as a negative modulator of P-dependent gene transcription mediated by PR-A/PR-B heterodimer. PR-B Interaction with BTEB1 Is Dependent on Ligand Type—Because the type of ligand bound to a steroid receptor influences its subsequent interaction with other nuclear cofactors, the effects of type I (ZK98299) and type II (RU486) PR antagonists on the functional relationship of PR-B dimer and BTEB1 were compared with that of R5020 (PR agonist). RU486 and ZK98299 have higher and lower affinities, respectively, for PR than PR agonists, although both are known to elicit the formation of the PR-B dimer (30Leonhardt S.A. Altmann M. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1914-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), resulting in inhibition of P-dependent promoter activity (see Ref. 35Leonhardt S.A. Edwards D.P. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 969-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar for review). The transactivity of the PR-B dimer was observed only when bound to R5020, and this was augmented by BTEB1 co-expression (Fig. 3). By contrast, the respective complex formed with either ZK98299 or RU486, when used at the same concentration as R5020, had no effect on basal promoter activity but, as expected, inhibited the induction of this promoter's activity by R5020-bound PR-B. Interestingly, the negative effect of either compound on PR-B transactivity was not reversed by the presence of BTEB1. Taken together, results suggest that the initial formation of PR-B dimer of the correct conformation that is able not only to bind to its cognate response element but also permits the binding of other nuclear proteins is requisite for subsequent interaction with BTEB1. CBP Modulates Ligand-dependent PR-B Interaction with BTEB-1—To determine whether the transcriptional integrator CBP, which has been shown recently to act synergistically with the steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1) in PR transactivation (36Liu Z. Wong J. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12426-12431Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), modulates the transcriptional activity of either PR-A or PR-B in the presence of BTEB1, co-transfection experiments with the P-responsive MMTV-CAT reporter (37Cato A.C.B. Miksicek R. Schutz G. Arnemann J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2237-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and various combinations of expression constructs were carried out in COS-1 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the MMTV-promoter activity was unaffected by BTEB1, alone or in combination with either CBP or PR-A. On the other hand, CBP and unliganded PR-A individually increased basal promoter activity, albeit their combined effects were not additive. The activities of PR-A and CBP when added together were enhanced by BTEB1, independent of the presence of ligand. The P-dependent PR-B transactivity was not augmented by CBP (Fig. 4B). However, the combination of BTEB1, PR-B and CBP maximally increased promoter activity, but only in a ligand-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). These findings indicate that although BTEB1/PR-B dimer association facilitates the recruitment of CBP into the PR-B complex, the functional interaction of PR-A with BTEB1 and CBP occurs through distinct mechanism(s). The latter finding may underlie, in part, the differing effects of each isoform on P-dependent gene transcription. Effects of KLF Members Sp1 and FKLF2/BTEB3 on PR-B Activity—Sp1, BTEB3, and BTEB1 exhibit significant homologies in their DNA-binding domains but differ in their transactivation domains, which are located primarily in the amino-terminal regions of these proteins (21Bieker J.J.

To assess the modulatory roles of Sp1 and BTEB3 relative to BTEB1 on PR-B transcriptional activity, transient transfection experiments were performed using expression constructs for each, singly and in combination with PR-B. Sp1 had minimal, albeit significant, effects on P-dependent PR-B transcriptional activation of the MMTV-CAT promoter relative to BTEB1 in COS-1 cells, which express both BTEB1 and Sp1 endogenously (Fig. 5A). By contrast, BTEB3 mimicked the effect of BTEB1. In particular, both BTEB1 and BTEB3 showed no activity on the MMTV-CAT promoter but enhanced the P-dependent PR-B transactivity to a similar extent (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, within the context of the UF gene promoter, which contains rec"

The downstream molecular effectors of these signals, however, have yet to be fully understood. We have recently shown that cAMP stimulation of gonadal cells leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor GATA-4, a key regulator of gonadal gene expression, thus suggesting that this factor might be a novel target for the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. We now show that the rapid phosphorylation of GATA-4 induced by cAMP in vivo can be blocked by a PKA-specific inhibitor but not by mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, indicating that GATA-4 is predominantly phosphorylated by PKA in response to cAMP in gonadal cells. In addition, using in vitro kinase assays, we show that PKA phosphorylation of GATA-4 occurs predominantly on an evolutionarily conserved serine residue located at position 261. Phosphorylation of GATA-4 Ser261 by PKA enhances its transcriptional activity on different gonadal promoters, an effect that was markedly reduced with a S261A mutant. Moreover, the S261A mutant blunted cAMP-induced promoter activity in gonadal cells. Finally, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of GATA-4 also led to enhanced recruitment of the CREB-binding protein coactivator. This recruitment and transcriptional cooperation were dramatically impaired with the S261A mutant. Thus, our results identify GATA-4 as a novel downstream effector of cAMP/PKA signaling in gonadal cells, where phosphorylation of Ser261 and recruitment of CREB-binding protein likely represent a key mechanism for conveying the cAMP responsiveness of gonadal genes that lack classical cAMP regulatory elements.

Gene expression in the gonads is under the influence of the pituitary trophic hormones luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Binding of these hormones to their G-coupled receptors activates adenylate cyclase leading to increased cAMP production. In the classical cAMP signaling pathway, cAMP associates with the regulatory subunits of the protein kinase A (PKA) 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; CREB, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; db-cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FL, full-length; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; AD, activation domain; DBD, DNA-binding domain. holoenzyme, allowing dissociation of its catalytic subunits, which then translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate target proteins (1Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The best studied target of PKA is the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), which binds as a dimer to the 8-bp palindromic sequence CRE found in the regulatory region of some cAMP-regulated genes. Phosphorylation of CREB Ser133 by PKA allows recruitment of the coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP), which contacts the transcriptional machinery leading to increased gene transcription (3Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar). In the gonads, however, several cAMP-regulated genes, such as steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star), steroid 17α-hydroxylase (Cyp17), P450scc (Cyp11A1), inhibin α (Inha), and aromatase (Cyp19), lack consensus CRE elements. Therefore, transcription factors in addition to CREB must be acting as downstream effectors of cAMP signaling in gonadal cells. There are several factors that have been shown to be activated by cAMP in gonadal cells. These include stimulatory protein 1 (Sp1), upstream stimulatory factor, estrogen receptor α/β, activating protein 1 (AP-1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β, and Nur77/NR4A1 (4Nalbant D.

Although these transcription factors have been shown to contribute to the hormonal regulation of gonadal genes, most are ubiquitously expressed and respond to several stimuli other than cAMP. Moreover, not all cAMP-responsive gonadal promoters lacking CRE elements have binding sites for these factors. In the gonads, the orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1/NR5A1) has been proposed to be a candidate factor downstream of cAMP/PKA. In support of this hypothesis, SF-1-binding sites are found in several hormonally regulated genes. Indeed, a role for SF-1 in the cAMP-dependent stimulation of several gonadal genes has been described (9Parker K.L. Rice D.A. Lala D.S. Ikeda Y. Luo X. Wong M. Bakke M. Zhao L. Frigeri C. Hanley N.A. Stallings N. Schimmer B.P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2002; 57: 19-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Although SF-1 can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro (10Zhang P. Mellon S.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), SF-1 is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, and its phosphorylation levels are not affected by cAMP treatment (11Hammer G.D.

Unfortunately, the absence of adrenals and gonads in SF-1 knockout mice (12Luo X. Ikeda Y. Parker K.L. Cell. 1994; 77: 481-490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 13Sadovsky Y.

However, in other steroidogenic tissues normally expressing SF-1, such as the placenta and skin, expression of the cAMP-regulated genes Cyp11A1 and Cyp17 was normal in SF-1–/– mice (13Sadovsky Y. Crawford P.A. Woodson K.G. Polish J.A. Clements M.A. Tourtellotte L.M. Simburger K. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, SF-1 might not be the predominant downstream effector of cAMP signaling in gonadal cells. In addition to SF-1 regulatory elements, many cAMP-regulated gonadal promoters also contain GATA motifs for the binding of members of the GATA family of transcription factors. There are six vertebrate GATA factors (named GATA-1 to GATA-6). Four of these are expressed in the mammalian gonads: GATA-1, GATA-2, GATA-4, and GATA-6 (17Viger R.S. Mertineit C. Trasler J.M.

Development. 1994; 120: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, GATA-4 is strongly expressed from the onset of gonadal development and is later found in multiple cell lineages including testicular Sertoli and Leydig cells and granulosa cells of the ovary (17Viger R.S. Mertineit C. Trasler J.M. Nemer M. Development. 1998; 125: 2665-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the function of these cells is under hormonal control, GATA-4 may represent a key effector of hormonal signaling in gonadal cells. In agreement with this, GATA-4 has been shown to regulate several cAMP-dependent gonadal promoters including StAR, inhibin α, and aromatase PII (25Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently shown that cAMP stimulation of gonadal cells leads to phosphorylation of GATA-4 (26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3935-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although PKA was a likely candidate, the kinase(s) activated by cAMP in gonadal cells and responsible for directly phosphorylating GATA-4 remained unknown. We now report that GATA-4 is indeed a key effector of cAMP signaling in gonadal cells. Using MA-10 Leydig cells, we show that GATA-4 is phosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation predominantly through PKA and not the MAPK signal transduction pathway. cAMP-induced phosphorylation occurs on Ser261, an evolutionarily conserved residue of the GATA-4 protein. Additionally, we provide a novel mechanism whereby activation of GATA-4 by PKA regulates multiple target genes via an enhanced recruitment of the CBP transcriptional coactivator. Plasmids—Luciferase reporters for the murine –902-bp StAR, –218-bp aromatase PII, and –679-bp inhibin α promoters have been described previously (25Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The –447-bp steroid 17α-hydroxylase promoter was amplified by PCR from rat genomic DNA (forward primer, 5′-CACTGTTTTGTGTGACCTTATGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCAGGTGTAGGCAGATGGCCAGC-3′). The GATA-Müllerian inhibiting substance reporter was obtained by cloning one copy of the GATA element from the StAR promoter (sense oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCCACTTTTTTATCTCAAGTGA-3′; antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCTCACTTGAGATAAAAAAGTG-3′) upstream of the minimal Müllerian inhibiting substance promoter (27Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1388-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). GATA-4 expression vectors (wild-type, hemagglutinin-tagged, ΔN2, ΔC1, and ΔN1C1) have been previously reported (25Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S.

Robert N.M. Viger R.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1636-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The GATA-4 S261A mutant was obtained by sitedirected mutagenesis of GATA-4 using the QuikChange® XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the following pair of oligonucleotides (the mutation is underlined): forward, 5′-CCTCAGCGCCGGCTGGCTGCCTCCCGCCGG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGGCGGGAGGCAGCCAGCCGGCGCTGAGG-3′. The VP16-ΔN1C1 construct was obtained by cloning the VP16 activation domain upstream of ΔN1C1. A portion of the CBP cDNA (corresponding to amino acids 1200–1900) was amplified by PCR (forward primer, 5′-GCTCTAGATGCTGTGGACGAAAGTATGAGTTC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CGGGATCCTATGTGCTGGGCTGCTGTGTAGGAGTC-3′) and subcloned into a pcDNA3 expression vector modified to provide its own ATG. Production of GST-GATA-4 Fusion Proteins—GST-GATA-4 fusion proteins were obtained by cloning various regions of rat GATA-4 in frame with GST using the pGEX2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). Fusion proteins were produced in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 and purified using a glutathione resin (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfections—CV-1 and L fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum. The MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were grown in Waymouth's medium containing 15% horse serum (30Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were transfected in 24-well plates using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (25Tremblay J.J. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). MA-10 cells were seeded in 12-well plates and transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). In brief, 1.5 μg of StAR-luciferase reporter and 500 ng of either an empty expression vector or expression vectors for full-length GATA-4 or GATA-4 S261A were transfected with 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent/well in serum- and antibiotic-free media. Renilla (phRL-TK) luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as an internal control. Complete medium was added 6 h after transfection. The next morning, the cells were treated with either vehicle (H2O) or 0.5 mm dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP; Sigma-Aldrich) for 6 h and then harvested and analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system from Promega. The data reported represent the averages of at least three experiments, each done in duplicate. Nuclear Extracts and Western Blots—Nuclear extracts were prepared by the procedure described by Schreiber et al. (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Recombinant GATA proteins were obtained by transfecting L cells with expression vectors for the different GATA-4 proteins. In Western analyses, 10-μg aliquots of nuclear extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Immunodetection of the native GATA-4 protein was achieved using a GATA-4 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Hemagglutinin-tagged GATA-4 proteins were detected using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (BD Biosciences Canada, Mississauga, Canada), and a VECTASTAIN®-ABC-Amp™ Western blot detection kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingham, CA). Duolux™ (Vector Laboratories) was used as chemiluminescent substrate. Analysis of in Vivo GATA-4 Phosphorylation—MA-10 cells were seeded in 6-well plates using complete media. The next day, the cells were washed and maintained in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 30 min. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 2 h. The cells were then treated with either vehicle or different signaling pathways inhibitors (50 μm PD90059 (ERK1/2 pathway), 10 μm SB203580 (p38 MAPK pathway), and 10 μm H89 (PKA pathway) from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) for 30 min. The cells were finally stimulated for 2 h by adding either vehicle (H2O) or 0.5 mm db-cAMP. The 2-h cAMP treatment period is within the range of times that others have reported for the induction of GATA phosphorylation in various systems using either in vivo phosphorylation or increased GATA binding as functional endpoints (32Chen C.H.

After stimulation, the cells were washed and lysed in 300 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1% Igepal (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml of the protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin (Sigma-Aldrich Canada)). Radiolabeled GATA-4 was purified by immunoprecipitation with 2 μl of GATA-4 antiserum (Santa Cruz) for 2 h at 4 °C. A 20-μl aliquot of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added, and incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were washed five times in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, resuspended in 1× Laemmli loading buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Labeled GATA-4 protein was visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed using 1 μg of the different GST-GATA-4 proteins and 10 units of PKA catalytic subunit for 30 min at 30 °C (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Canada) in a total volume of 40 μl containing 1 μl (10 μCi) of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 50 μm of cold ATP. The reactions were terminated by adding 1× Laemmli loading buffer and heating the mixture for 5 min at 95 °C. After SDS-PAGE, the labeled proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by autoradiography. The total protein was visualized by Coomassie staining of the gel. Pull-down Assay—In vitro pull-down assays were performed as previously described (26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3935-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A portion of the CBP protein (amino acids 1200–1900) was 35S-labeled using the TnT in vitro transcription/translation kit from Promega. The GST-G4255–440 fusion protein (500 ng) was in vitro phosphorylated as described above but with unlabeled ATP. Unincorporated ATP was eliminated by one wash in 500 μl of binding buffer without bovine serum albumin (26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3935-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) before incubation with 35S-labeled CBP. GATA-4 Is Phosphorylated through the cAMP/PKA Pathway in Vivo—Recent results obtained in our laboratory using an antibody against a phosphoserine residue indicated that the GATA-4 transcription factor was phosphorylated in response to cAMP stimulation of MA-10 cells (26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3935-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although our results suggested that PKA might be responsible for GATA-4 phosphorylation, the exact signaling pathway and kinase involved had not been identified. To further analyze the phosphorylation status of GATA-4 and identify the signaling pathway involved, [32P]orthophosphate metabolic labeling studies were performed in quiescent and db-cAMP-stimulated MA-10 Leydig cells; the experimental protocol is depicted in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 1B, GATA-4 is constitutively phosphorylated in these cells in the absence of any stimulation. GATA-4 phosphorylation levels, however, were significantly increased (more than 3.5-fold) following db-cAMP treatment (Fig. 1B, top panel). This increase occurred without a change in total GATA-4 protein levels (Fig. 1B, lower panel), which is consistent with previous studies showing that hormonal stimulation of MA-10 cells has no effect on GATA-4 mRNA and protein levels (7Silverman E. Eimerl S. Orly J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17987-17996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S.

Wu A.Z. Feng Z.M. Mruk D. Cheng C.Y. Chen C.L. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because GATA-4 has recently been shown to be phosphorylated at amino acid Ser105 through the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways in cardiac cells (33Charron F. Tsimiklis G. Arcand M. Robitaille L. Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. Meloche S. Nemer M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2702-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and because cAMP is also known to activate the MAPK pathways (6Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 209-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), we used different inhibitors to identify which signaling pathway is responsible for GATA-4 phosphorylation in gonadal cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, cAMP-induced GATA-4 phosphorylation was completely abrogated by H89, a PKA inhibitor, but not by SB203580 or PD90059, which are inhibitors of the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK pathways, respectively. The inhibitory effect of H89 was not simply due to a blockade of basal GATA-4 phosphorylation because H89 treatment in the absence of cAMP only resulted in a slight decrease in phosphorylation levels (Fig. 1B, right panel). Thus, PKA appears to be the predominant kinase responsible for cAMP-induced GATA-4 phosphorylation in MA-10 cells. To map the relevant phosphoacceptor site, we next examined the GATA-4 primary amino acid sequence for potential PKA phosphorylation sites. One putative PKA consensus phosphorylation site that matches the high affinity RRXS motif is present at amino acid position 261 (Ser261) between the two zinc fingers of the DNA-binding domain (Fig. 2A). This region is perfectly conserved between the rat, mouse, human, bovine, rabbit, frog, fish, and chick GATA-4 proteins (Fig. 2A). To characterize the ability of this site to undergo PKA-mediated phosphorylation, in vitro kinase assays were performed using various GST-GATA-4 fusion proteins (Fig. 2B). PKA efficiently phosphorylated a GATA-4 C-terminal fusion protein (GST-G4 255–440) containing the consensus PKA motif, whereas N-terminal constructs lacking this region (GST-G4 1–200 and GST-G4 1–260) could not be phosphorylated by PKA. Therefore, the PKA target site(s) on GATA-4 are located between amino acids 261 and 440. Consistent with this, mutation of Ser261 (GST-G4 255–440 S261A) or a further N-terminal deletion that removes Ser261 (GST-G4 302–440) severely impaired PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 2B, lower panel). As revealed by total protein staining (Fig. 2B, lower panel), the absence of phosphorylation observed with GST fusion proteins lacking Ser261 was not due to low amounts of protein. The multiple bands likely represent different proteolytic fragments of the various fusion proteins. Thus, these results suggest that Ser261 is a predominant phosphoacceptor site of the GATA-4 protein targeted by the cAMP/PKA signaling cascade in MA-10 Leydig cells. The weak phosphorylation observed with the GST-G4 255–440 S261A and GST-G4 302–440 constructs, however, suggests that there might also be low affinity phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal portion of the GATA-4 protein. PKA-mediated Phosphorylation Activates GATA-4 —If cAMP/PKA phosphorylation of GATA-4 plays a role in hormone-induced gonadal gene expression, then phosphorylation of GATA-4 might enhance its transactivation properties on target gonadal promoters. Indeed, we have recently reported that PKA activates GATA-4 transcriptional activity on the murine StAR promoter (26Tremblay J.J. Hamel F. Viger R.S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3935-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, we now report that in addition to StAR, PKA enhances the GATA-4-dependent activation of several gonadal promoters including 17α-hydroxylase, aromatase, and inhibin α. The stimulatory effect of PKA most likely occurs through phosphorylation of GATA-4 because PKA alone (Fig. 3, white bars) had no effect on promoter activity. This stimulation was also strictly dependent on GATA-4 binding to DNA because deletion or mutation of the GATA elements in the respective target promoters prevented transactivation by GATA-4 and enhancement by PKA (data not shown). Therefore, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of GATA-4 activates its transcriptional activity on a variety of GATA-dependent promoters that are active in gonadal cells. PKA-dependent Activation of GATA-4 Requires Ser261—To establish the importance of Ser261 for basal and PKA-stimulated GATA-4 transcriptional activities, the full-length wild-type (FL) or mutated (FL S261A) GATA-4 proteins were used in cotransfection experiments (Fig. 4A). Consistent with its role in PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 2), mutation of GATA-4 Ser261 (FL S261A) markedly reduced its activation by PKA without affecting basal transactivation (Fig. 4A). This decrease was not due to differences in expression, nuclear localization, or stability of the two different GATA-4 constructs because both the wild-type and S261A GATA-4 proteins were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4B). The residual enhancement of GATA-4 S261A by PKA is likely attributable to low affinity phosphorylation site(s) located in the C-terminal region of the GATA-4 protein (Fig. 2B). As previously mentioned, the GATA-4 protein contains another phosphorylation site at Ser105, which is a target of the p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK in cardiac cells (33Charron F. Tsimiklis G. Arcand M. Robitaille L. Liang Q. Molkentin J.D. Meloche S. Nemer M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2702-2719Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 35Liang Q. Wiese R.J. Bueno O.F. Dai Y.S. Markham B.E. Molkentin J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7460-7469Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remained possible that the PKA enhancement of GATA-4 transcriptional activity could be indirectly mediated through the MAPK pathway. Although a constitutively active form of MAPK/ERK kinase 1 (MEK1 CA) could enhance full-length GATA-4 transcriptional activity (Fig. 4C), this enhancement was lost when the N-terminal domain of GATA-4 containing the MAPK target Ser105 was removed (ΔN2). In contrast, PKA could still enhance the activity of this same construct. This differential effect was not due to differences in the amount of GATA-4 protein present because both the full-length (FL) and ΔN2 GATA-4 constructs were expressed at similar levels (Fig. 4D). Moreover, the enhancing effects of PKA and MEK1 were not due to increases in GATA-4 expression because the total GATA-4 protein levels were not altered by either kinase (Fig. 4D). Therefore, GATA-4 appears to contain at least two independent phosphorylation sites of which Ser261 is indispensable for the maximal transcriptional enhancement by PKA. Because the GATA-4 Ser261 mutation blunted PKA-mediated transcriptional enhancement in heterologous cells, we next examined the effect of this mutation on cAMP-induced StAR promoter activity in MA-10 cells (Fig. 5). Stimulation of MA-10 cells with db-cAMP activated the StAR promoter about 6-fold; cAMP induction was not affected by exogenously expressed GATA-4 (Fig. 5, compare the gray and stippled bars). This induction, however, was blunted by overexpression of the nonphosphorylatable GATA-4 S261A mutant (Fig. 5, solid bar), which competes with endogenous GATA-4 protein for DNA binding. Thus, these results suggest t"

The oxidative phosphorylation system or electron transport chain is located within the mitochondrial inner membrane and is intimately responsible for three important processes: (i) ATP production, (ii) generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ, coenzyme Q; DIC, differential interference contrast.1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; CoQ, coenzyme Q; DIC, differential interference contrast. and (iii) regulation of programmed cell death or apoptosis. The proximal ROS is superoxide anion (O.2−), which derives from the Q cycle at rates estimated between 0.1 and 2% of the total electron flow (reviewed in Refs. 1Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol.

A variety of enzymatic and nonenzymatic defense mechanisms have evolved to either quench free radicals or ameliorate their resultant oxidative damage. Apoptosis (or programmed cell death) occurs by a mechanism that is conserved from nematodes to humans (reviewed in Refs. 3Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

In Caenorhabditis elegans, a largely invariant cell lineage (including 131 specific somatic cells destined to undergo apoptosis during hermaphroditic development) has provided fertile ground for the study of apoptosis. In other organisms, mitochondria are thought to provide a major initiation signal for apoptosis via the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which leads to the release of a number of cell death-promoting factors, including cytochrome c. In C. elegans, normal, developmentally regulated apoptoses are not mediated by cytochrome c leakage from mitochondria. Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system defects can cause a perplexing variety of diseases that exhibit a significant degree of clinical heterogeneity (reviewed in Refs. 5Morgan J.A. Hann M G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1410: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 6Wallace D.G. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar). For the most part, the pathophysiologies present themselves in tissues with high energy demands, such as heart and muscle. The interrelationship of the three activities described above (e.g. ATP generation, ROS production, and apoptosis initiation) may explain some of the perplexing pathophysiological features of mitochondrial diseases. We have previously described the mev-1(kn1) mutant of the nematode C. elegans as containing a point mutation in Cyt-1 (a large subunit of cytochrome b in complex II) (7Ishii N. Michikhiko F.

Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), mev-1 ages precociously at high oxygen concentrations and accumulates markers of aging (e.g. fluorescent materials and protein carbonyls) more rapidly compared with the wild type (9Honda S.

We have recently shown that there are two distinct pathophysiologies in mev-1 animals, viz. increased superoxide production from mitochondria and abnormal energy metabolism (12Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Here, we report the results from histochemical and ultrastructural examinations of mev-1 mutants that revealed severe defects in succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase and in the membrane potential (Δψm) of mitochondria. In addition, mev-1 was found to possess morphological abnormalities in muscle mitochondria, particularly under hyperoxia. CED-9 and Cyt-1 protein levels were also abnormal in the mev-1 mitochondrial membrane. This may explain our electron microscopic and Nomarski-DIC microscopic observations of supernumerary apoptosis in mev-1 embryos. The abnormal apoptosis was suppressed by mutations in either ced-3 or ced-4, indicating that the inappropriate signal in mev-1 embryos stimulates induction of the normal ced-9/ced-4/ced-3 apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, the mev-1,ced-3 double mutant lived longer than mev-1, suggesting that the supernumerary apoptoses contribute to the phenotype of life shortening in mev-1. General Methods and Strains—Culturing techniques have been described previously (13Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PH126 (ced-3(n1286) mev-1(kn1) unc-50(e306)) was constructed by crossing MT3002 (ced-3(n1286)) hermaphrodites with mev-1 unc-50 heterozygous males and scoring for second generation uncoordinated animals, who gave rise exclusively to third generation embryos with no apoptotic cells. PH137 (ced-4(n1162) dpy-17(e164) mev-1(kn1) unc-50(e306)) was constructed by crossing MT2551 (ced-4(n1162) dpy-17(e164)) hermaphrodites with mev-1(kn1) unc-50(e306) heterozygous males and picking Dpy Unc second generation progeny. Age synchronous populations were prepared as described previously (9Honda S. Ishii N. Suzuki K. Matsuo M. J. Gerontol. 1993; 48: B57-B61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Adachi H.

Ageing Dev. 1994; 74: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Hatching was determined as described previously (9Honda S. Ishii N. Suzuki K. Matsuo M. J. Gerontol. 1993; 48: B57-B61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 10Adachi H. Fujiwara Y. Ishii N. J. Gerontol. 1998; 53A: B240-B244Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Hosokawa H. Ishii N. Ishida H. Ichimori K. Nakazawa H. Suzuki K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 74: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The life spans of individual adult hermaphrodites were determined on agar plates. To prevent progeny production, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) was added to the nematode growth agar at a final concentration of 40 μm after animals had reached adulthood (14Mitchell D.H Stiles J.W. Satelli J. Sanadi D.R. J. Gerontol. 1979; 35: 28-36Crossref Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Histochemical Analysis of Succinate-CoQ Oxidoreductase—Young adults were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN) and stored at –80 °C until analyzed. Frozen cross-sections of 10 μm were cut on a cryostat at –20 °C; collected on glass slides; and incubated in 0.05 m sodium succinate, 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.5 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride at 37 °C for 1 h to stain for succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase. The cross-sections were fixed in formaldehyde, dehydrated with a series of alcohols, and embedded in glycerol. Electron Microscopy—Embryos and young adults were fixed overnight in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at room temperature. The samples were then washed with 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and post-fixed in 1% OsO4 and 0.05 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. After fixation, the samples were dehydrated with a series of alcohols and embedded in Quetol 812 (Nissin EM Ltd.). Thin sections were stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined under a Joel 1200EX electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Assay of Δψm—JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide, catalog no. T-3168, Molecular Probes) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The JC-1 solution was added to newly hatched larvae in S basal buffer at 1 μg/ml and incubated in the dark for 10 min. After washing three times with S basal buffer, the animals were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Images were analyzed by Adobe Photoshop for emission characteristic of JC-1 monomers and aggregates. Cell Corpse Assay—The mean numbers of cell corpses (mean ± S.D.) in comma stage embryos (∼400 min after the first cleavage) (15Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson N. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2755) Google Scholar) of wild-type, mev-1, and mev-1,ced-3 animals were counted under Nomarski-DIC microscopy, examining for the signature raised appearance of apoptotic cells (18Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies against Cyt-1 and CED-9—To raise antibodies, peptides were first synthesized using an automated peptide synthesizer. The peptides consisted of either amino acids 40–54 of C. elegans Cyt-1 or amino acids 206–223 of C. elegans CED-9 with an additional cysteine residue in the COOH terminus. The synthesized peptides were then conjugated to the adjuvant keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem). Five-week-old female BALB/c mice were immunized four times by injection with 100 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyaninconjugated Cyt-1 or CED-9 peptide. The serum antibody titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Spleens were removed 3 days after the final injection of the antigen, and 108 splenocytes were fused with 2 × 107 mouse myeloma P3U1 cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol 1000. Aliquots of the culture supernatants from the resultant hybridoma cells were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cloned twice by limited dilution to obtain monoclonal cell lines. Finally, stable clones showing anti-Cyt-1 (KM2408) or anti-CED-9 (KM2422) antibody activity were obtained. The hybridoma cells (5–20 × 106) were injected intraperitoneally into 8-week-old female BALB/c nude mice, and monoclonal antibodies were purified from the ascites fluid. Preparation of Mitochondrial Fractions for Western Blot Analysis— Young adults were harvested by centrifugation and washed five times with S basal buffer and once with isolation buffer (210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). The worms were homogenized (10%, w/v) in isolation buffer with a Teflon-glass homogenizer. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation at 600 × g to remove debris and then at 7200 × g to pellet mitochondria. Mitochondrial protein was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western Blot Analysis—Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were boiled in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 0.14 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in buffer consisting of 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.036% SDS, and 20% methanol and probed with 1 μg/ml KM2408 or 3 μg/ml KM2422. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Succinate-CoQ Oxidoreductase Activity—Histochemical analysis of succinate-CoQ oxidoreductase activity was performed on frozen sections of wild-type and mev-1 young adults (Fig. 1). Enzyme activity was widespread throughout wild-type animals, including embryos, with a concentration in body wall muscles. Conversely, there was a complete absence of staining in mev-1 animals. This is consistent with the previous observation of reduced levels in mev-1 cell extracts (7Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural Abnormalities in mev-1—Electron micrographs of wild-type body wall muscles revealed normal mitochondrial morphologies, including extensive cristae, at 21% oxygen (Fig. 2A) as well as at 50 and 10% oxygen (Fig. 2, B and C). Conversely, the mitochondria from mev-1 body wall muscles had progressively disorganized cristae as oxygen was increased (Fig. 2, D–F). Many such mitochondria also contained electron-dense and amorphous inclusions at 21% oxygen (Fig. 2D), with additional paracrystalline inclusions apparent in animals reared under 50% oxygen (Fig. 2E). Similar ultrastructural abnormalities were present in hypodermal cells, including cuticles of mev-1 (but not wild-type) animals (data not shown). These abnormalities did not appear at 10% oxygen (Fig. 2F). Similar ultrastructural changes also characterized mev-1 intestinal cells. Although reasonably normal at 21% oxygen (Fig. 3C), mev-1 intestinal mitochondria were noticeably swollen and rounded after animals were incubated under 50% oxygen (Fig. 3D). Unlike with mev-1 mitochondria in muscle, no inclusion bodies were present. Again, hyperoxia had no detectable effect on the wild type (Fig. 2B). Is it possible that the more pronounced ultrastructural abnormalities in mev-1 muscle versus intestinal tissue reflect the higher levels of oxidative phosphorylation in the former. Δψm—The ability of mitochondria to generate a membrane potential was monitored by fluorescence microscopy after adding the dye JC-1. This dye is taken up by mitochondria as a monomer and forms J-aggregates when concentrated in highly polarized mitochondrial membranes. This transition is reflected by green fluorescence for monomers and by red fluorescence for dimers. In Fig. 4 (A and B), images of the wild type and mev-1 loaded with JC-1 are shown, respectively. The image of mev-1 showed a similar profile of monomers, but there were markedly fewer J-aggregates, indicating that Δψm was significantly reduced in the mev-1 mutant. CED-9 and Cyt-1 Protein Levels Are Abnormal in mev-1 Mitochondria—Using antibodies raised against peptides that correspond to portions encoded by the ced-9 and cyt-1 genes, Western blotting was performed using mitochondrial preparations from wild-type and mev-1 animals grown at different oxygen concentrations (Fig. 5A). Densitometric analyses revealed that the CED-9 and Cyt-1 protein levels were different in the two strains (Fig. 5B). The level of Cyt-1 in mev-1 mitochondria was remarkably reduced under hyperoxia. In contrast, hyperoxia induced CED-9 protein levels in wild-type mitochondria, but caused a statistically insignificant reduction in mev-1 mitochondria. The levels of ced-9 and cyt-1 mRNAs in the wild type and mev-1 remained unchanged when oxygen was varied between 21 and 50% (data not shown); thus, the reduction of CED-9 and Cyt-1 protein levels in mev-1 mitochondrial membranes may result from a structural abnormality of mitochondria. Apoptosis, Embryogenesis, and Life Span—Given the importance of CED-9 in triggering apoptosis, its abnormal expression in mev-1 suggested that this mutant might have an altered pattern of apoptosis. Indeed, the following data indicate that the mev-1 mutation causes supernumerary embryonic apoptosis, especially under hyperoxia. Wild-type and mev-1 embryos were scored using Nomarski-DIC microscopy at the “comma” stage (∼400 min after the first cell division) for the presence of cells with the distinctive and easily recognizable raised and rounded morphology that characterizes apoptotic cells. The number of such cell corpses in mev-1 embryos was >2-fold higher than in wild-type embryos (Fig. 6). The supposition that these were indeed supernumerary apoptoses is supported by the observation that null mutations in either ced-3 or ced-4 completely suppressed this (Fig. 6). These two genes are integral elements of the ced-9/ced-4/ced-3 apoptotic pathway in C. elegans and are known to completely suppress the normal, developmentally regulated apoptoses for which this nematode is so well known. In addition to supernumerary apoptosis, we observed grossly malformed mev-1 embryos that contained evidence of necrosis, particularly under hyperoxia (data not shown). As described previously (8Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tornita S. Keino T. Honda S. Yoshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), the life span of the mev-1 mutant was shorter than that of the wild type (Fig. 7). The survival curve of the mev-1,ced-3 double mutant was similar to that of the wild type during the first one-forth or so of life and then resembled that of mev-1 during the later half (Fig. 7). This is numerically evidenced by the fact that the times needed to reduce survival to 80% were essentially identical in mev-1,ced-3 (17.0 days) and the wild type (17.5 days), which were significantly longer than the 11.7 days for mev-1. Conversely, the times necessary to reduce survival to 20% were similar in mev-1 (21.5 days) and mev-1,ced-3 (21.4 days), but not in the wild type (25 days). Thus, a portion of the mev-1-specific reduction in life span was abrogated by a mutation that suppresses apoptosis, suggesting that the supernumerary apoptoses in mev-1 contribute to its shortened life span.Fig. 7Life spans of the wild type, mev-1, and mev-1,ced-3. Inclusion of the ced-3 mutation, which suppresses apoptosis, caused a partial restoration of life span in mev-1. This suggests that the supernumerary apoptosis in mev-1 contributes to its shortened life span.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As expected, the majority of wild-type animals completed embryonic development within 12 h after fertilization and hatched to become L1 larvae (Fig. 8). Conversely, hyperoxia negatively impacted this process in mev-1 embryos (Fig. 8). One of the greatest challenges in the molecular genetics era has been to elucidate the mechanisms by which specific mutations manifest themselves as phenotypic changes. This challenge increases significantly as one moves to progressively higher orders of biological organization. We have previously established that mev-1(kn1) is a missense mutation in a complex II subunit of the electron transport chain (7Ishii N. Michikhiko F. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanases S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Since that discovery, a significant challenge has been to account for the varied pathologies imposed by this mutation. We present them in the deliberate order below, reflecting the notion that each successive pathology is the consequence of those preceding it. First, it is clear that the mev-1 mutation initially manifests itself as three distinct biochemical pathologies (12Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar): (i) elevated ROS levels in mev-1 mutants (specifically, superoxide anion levels in both intact mitochondrial and submitochondrial particles were approximately two times greater in mev-1 mutants than in the wild type); (ii) depletion of the ROS scavenger glutathione in mev-1 animals, which presumably renders mev-1 animals more susceptible to the increased ROS levels mentioned above; and (iii) a higher ratio of lactate to pyruvate in mev-1 mutants, suggesting that a metabolic imbalance known as lactate acidosis occurs in these animals. Second, these three biochemical pathologies, especially the first two, result in significantly higher levels of oxidative stress in mev-1 animals, particularly in and around mitochondria. Third, this oxidative stress leads to perturbations in mitochondrial function that manifest as ultrastructural abnormalities, particularly under hyperoxic conditions (Figs. 2 and 3). These were more pronounced in body wall muscle than in intestinal cells, which presumably correlates with the relative rates of respiration and hence the levels of oxidative stress. Many electron-dense and amorphous inclusions at 21% oxygen (Fig. 2D) or additional paracrystalline inclusions apparent in animals reared under 50% oxygen (Fig. 2E) may be mitochondrial creatine kinase (16Stadhouders A.M. Jap P.H.K. Winkler H.-P. Eppenberger H.M. Wallimann T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5089-5093Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Perhaps even more importantly, Δψm was severely compromised in mev-1 (Fig. 4). This suggests that the ultrastructural abnormalities lead to a loss of mitochondrial functionality in mev-1 animals. It is also possible that the decreased Δψm was not due to increased oxidative stress per se, but to another abnormal consequence of electron transport by the complex II defect in mev-1. Fourth, we have demonstrated that mitochondrially localized CED-9 protein levels are altered in a mev-1 genetic background (Fig. 5). CED-9, the structural and functional homolog of Bcl-2, is a mitochondrially bound protein that controls apoptosis by regulating CED-4 and CED-3 activity (reviewed in Refs. 3Liu Q.A. Hengartner M.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 887: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar and 4Meier P. Finch A. Evan C. Nature. 2000; 407: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). CED-9 was induced in wild-type mitochondria by hyperoxia, but this induction was not observed in mev-1 mitochondria. As the mRNA levels of CED-9 and Cyt-1 were unchanged, the differences between the wild type and mev-1 reflect some sort of post-translational alteration. Again, it is possible that these differences are a secondary consequence of the increased oxidative stress that characterizes mev-1. Alternatively, they may reflect a more direct consequence of the mev-1 mutation that acts to directly alter the mitochondrial membrane such that CED-9 cannot be properly retained. The lower amount of mitochondrially localized CED-9 in mev-1 may in turn be insufficient to protect against the oxidative damage induced by hyperoxia. It is also possible that this MEV-1 protein may be destabilized in the mutant. Indeed, mRNA levels were unchanged, but this protein appeared only in mitochondria, not in the cytosol (data not shown). The increase in the CED-9 levels in the wild type may be due to up-regulation responding to oxidative stress, and mev-1 may not have this ability. Fifth, the observation of supernumerary apoptosis in mev-1 embryos (Fig. 6) is a logical and perhaps inevitable consequence of the pathologies articulated above. Its suppression by null mutations in either ced-3 or ced-4 indicates that, although the trigger is different from that normally employed by C. elegans during developmental pruning, the basic apoptotic machinery is the same. All of these pathologies ultimately explain two important organismal consequences of the mev-1 mutation. The first was that mev-1 embryos failed to complete development under hyperoxia. Increased oxidative stress, abnormal mitochondrial structure/function, and ced-9-mediated supernumerary apoptosis may all have contributed to this. The second of these organismal consequences was the shortened life span perpetrated by the mev-1 mutation. Again, increased oxidation stress and abnormal mitochondrial structure/function may be important in this organismal phenotype. In addition, the ability of ced-3 to partially restore the life span of mev-1 to that of the wild type provides strong evidence that at least a portion of the reduced life span of mev-1 animals is due to abnormal apoptosis. In summary, it is now possible to sort the various phenotypes associated with the mev-1 mutation into a hierarchical scheme that progresses through increasing levels of biological complexity. Finally, it is worth noting that three overlapping but distinct types of apoptosis have now been described in C. elegans. The first and most extensively explored is the developmentally regulated process in which specific cells are predestined to undergo programmed cell death in C. elegans. Specifically, 131 specific somatic cells are destined for apoptosis during normal development of hermaphrodites. Second, Gartner et al. (17Gartner A. Milstein S. Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Hengartner M.O. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) have described widespread apoptosis that can occur in the C. elegans germ line in response to DNA damage. Third, we have presented evidence of supernumerary apoptosis in somatic cells of mev-1 embryos (Figs. 5 and 6), a likely consequence of the increased oxidative stress experienced by this mutant. There are a number of obvious similarities between these three types of apoptosis. First, they are morphologically similar (i.e. the apoptotic cells appear identical under Nomarski-DIC microscopy). Second, all three types of apoptosis are executed using the same core machinery, i.e. they are each dependent upon the ced-9/ced-4/ced-3 gene products. There are also some clear differences between the three types of apoptosis. The first type of apoptosis is developmentally regulated and is restricted to specific cells in the lineage. It is not triggered by oxidative stress, having evolved as a “hardwired” characteristic to selectively eliminate specific cells in the C. elegans lineage. Conversely, the latter two are flexible and are responses to cellular damage. Both are likely evolutionary devices more akin to that in mammals, in which apoptosis serves as a mechanism to eliminate incapacitated cells that might threaten the whole organism (reviewed in Ref. 18Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). It is likely that both the mev-1-stimulated apoptosis and the germ line apoptosis share the same or similar triggering mechanisms as employed by mammals to eliminate grossly damaged cells. However, in addition to the fact that one involves somatic cells and the other a germ line, they exhibit genetic differences. Specifically, the germ line apoptosis requires functional rad-5 and him-7 gene products, i.e. DNA damage-induced germ line apoptoses do not occur in rad-5 and him-7 mutants (17Gartner A. Milstein S. Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Hengartner M.O. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The rad-5 and him-7 mutants are not hypersensitive to oxidative stress, as is mev-1. 2P. S. Hartman, unpublished data. In addition, neither mutant shows supernumerary apoptoses in embryos. 2P. S. Hartman, unpublished data. Thus, it appears that the initial events that trigger these two types of apoptosis are different from one another. Further research will undoubtedly reveal more similarities and differences between these three types of apoptosis. As summarized in Fig. 9, the data in this and a previous report (12Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) go a long way toward clarifying the progressive consequences of the mev-1 mutation. We are indebted to Drs. K. Shibata and A. Furuya (Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. Ltd.) for preparing antibodies against the CED-9 and Cyt-1 proteins."

Previous studies have shown that formation of the tyrosyl-cysteine (Tyr-Cys) cofactor is a self-processing step requiring only copper and dioxygen. We have investigated the biogenesis of cofactor-containing galactose oxidase from pregalactose oxidase lacking the Tyr-Cys cross-link but having a fully processed N-terminal sequence, using both Cu(I) and Cu(II).

EDTA prevents reaction of pregalactose oxidase with Cu(II) but does not interfere with the Cu(I)-dependent biogenesis reaction. The yield of cross-link corresponds to the amount of copper added, although a fraction of the pregalactose oxidase protein is unable to undergo this cross-linking reaction. The latter component, which may have an altered conformation, does not interfere with analysis of cofactor biogenesis at low copper loading. The biogenesis product has been quantitatively characterized, and mechanistic studies have been developed for the Cu(I)-dependent reaction, which forms oxidized, mature galactose oxidase and requires two molecules of O2. Transient kinetics studies of the biogenesis reaction have revealed a pH sensitivity that appears to reflect ionization of a protein group (pKa = 7.3) at intermediate pH resulting in a rate acceleration and protonation of an early oxygenated intermediate at lower pH competing with commitment to cofactor formation.

Together with a closely related enzyme, glyoxal oxidase (5Whittaker M.M. Kersten P.J. Nakamura N. Sanders-Loehr J. Schweizer E.S. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9610-9613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has revealed that the active site of galactose oxidase (Fig. 1) contains a novel post-translational modification, a covalent bond between Cys228 and Tyr272 creating a new, thioetherbridged cross-linked amino acid, tyrosyl-cysteine (Tyr-Cys), without addition of exogenous atoms (12Ito N.

Characterization of the radical copper catalytic motif in galactose oxidase is complicated by the presence of multiple species in the as-isolated enzyme, including a significant fraction of apoenzyme, distinct forms of the metal- and cofactor-containing holoenzyme differing essentially in the number of electrons in the active site, as well as a portion of holoenzyme that is unable to generate a free radical complex and therefore does not contribute to catalytic activity (2Whittaker J.W.

The origins and functions of these specialized elements of protein structure are just beginning to be investigated in detail. Formation of the tryptophanyl-tryptoquinone catalytic cofactor in methylamine dehydrogenase appears to involve processing by ancillary enzymes (28Graichen M.E. Jones L.H. Sharma B.V. van Spanning R.J. Hosler J.P. Davidson V.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4216-4222Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, galactose oxidase cofactor biogenesis appears to be a self-processing event requiring only copper and O2 (29Rogers M.S. Baron A.J. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 990-991Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Galactose oxidase is distinct from the other examples in being a secretory protein, which means that its release in functional form involves at least three processing steps as follows: cleavage of the prepro leader sequence that directs translocation of the nascent polypeptide chain into the secretory pathway, metal binding, and cofactor biogenesis. The structure of a partially processed precursor form of the protein, containing the 17-amino acid N-terminal prosequence leader peptide but lacking both copper and cofactor, has been reported recently (30Firbank S.J. Rogers M.S. Wilmot C.M. Dooley D.M. Halcrow M.A. Knowles P.F. McPherson M.J. Phillips S.E.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12932-12937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The active site region of the unprocessed protein in the crystal exhibits large amplitude displacements of critical active site residues, reflecting a significant degree of conformational flexibility in the incompletely processed protein. Covalent modification of the active site cysteine to a sulfenic acid (Cys228-SOH) observed in the crystal may reflect oxidative damage to the protein. The precursor form of galactose oxidase has been shown to form spontaneously the cofactor in the presence of Cu(II) and dioxygen (29Rogers M.S. Baron A.J. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 990-991Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The successful heterologous expression of galactose oxidase in Pichia pastoris using non-native leader peptide to direct secretion indicates that the native prepro signal is not strictly required for either secretion of the protein or biogenesis of functional cofactor (31Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this work we have investigated in vitro biogenesis of the galactose oxidase redox cofactor, making use of recombinant protein containing the fully processed N terminus (no signal sequence) and lacking the thioether bond between Cys228 and Tyr272. Extensive and quantitative analysis of the cross-linking reaction and thorough characterization of the biogenesis product (by SDS-PAGE, activity measurements, optical absorption spectroscopy, and metal quantitation) is now leading to new insight into the mechanism of cofactor formation in galactose oxidase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBiological Materials—P. pastoris X33 (32Higgins D.R. Cregg J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 1-15PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant galactose oxidase was purified from high density methanol fermentation medium (33Stratton J. Chiruvolu V. Meagher M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar) of a P. pastoris transformant prepared by multicopy chromosomal integration of an expression cassette comprising the pPICZ Zeocin-selection plasmid (Invitrogen) linearized within the AOX1 promoter by digestion with PmeI. The coding region of the expression cassette contains a 5′-nucleotide sequence coding for either the Aspergillus niger glucoamylase leader peptide (Gla) or the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-mating factor leader peptide (αMF) spliced with the cDNA sequence corresponding to the secreted galactose oxidase protein. The galactose oxidase coding sequence was modified for expression of GAOX mutational variants (C228G, Y272G) using Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, and the protein was expressed and purified as described previously. For secretion of the unprocessed, cofactor-free pregalactose oxidase protein, the transformant was grown as described previously (31Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that the copper content of the medium was reduced to 15% of the amount described for the PTM4 trace metals supplement in the earlier work (33Stratton J. Chiruvolu V. Meagher M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 103: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar). The other modifications to fermentation conditions reported previously (31Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) were the elimination of casamino acids from the methanol induction phase and the exclusion of copper from the methanol feed-stock during expression. Pregalactose oxidase was purified as described previously (31Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) except that 2 mm EDTA was present in all buffer solutions. For biogenesis studies, the protein was passed through a gel filtration column to remove EDTA. Protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase was isolated from Brevibacterium fuscum as described previously (34Whittaker J.W. Lipscomb J.D. Kent T.A. Munck E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4466-4475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Reagents—MOPS, MES, CHES, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), l-cysteine, 1-O-methyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, and EDTA were obtained from Sigma. Acetonitrile, deuterium oxide (99.9 atom % 2H), and tetrakis(acetonitrile) copper(I) hexafluorophosphate [Cu(I) (CH3CN)4·PF6] were purchased from Aldrich. Guanidinium hydrochloride was from Pierce, and potassium ferricyanide was from Fluka (White Plains, NY).Biochemical Methods—Protein concentrations of purified galactose oxidase and pregalactose oxidase were determined by optical absorption measurements, using the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (ϵ280 = 1.05 × 105m–1 cm–1) as reported previously (35Tressel P.S. Kosman D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad ready-gels) were stained with GelCode Blue™ staining solution (Pierce). Gels were digitized using a scanner and analyzed with tnimage Measurement and Analysis program (36Nelson T.J. Tnimage Scientific Image Measurement and Analysis Lab Manual. The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD2000Google Scholar). Strip densitometric scan data were further analyzed using the line shape deconvolution routines of the Grams spectral analysis program (Galactic Industries Corp., Salem, NH). N-terminal sequence analysis of purified pregalactose oxidase was performed by Debra A. McMillen at the Biotechnology Laboratory, Institute of Molecular Biology, University of Oregon.Quantitation of free sulfhydryl groups in pregalactose oxidase, galactose oxidase, and variants was done using the DTNB test on protein in 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride using cysteine as standard (37Riddles P.W. Blakely R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Samples were heated in a water bath at 100 °C for 1 min and cooled on ice before addition of DTNB. Deblocking of cysteine sulfenic acid groups was performed as described (38You K.-S. Benitz L.V. McConachie W.A. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 384: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Claiborne A. Yeh J.I. Mallett T.C. Luba J. Crane III, E.J. Charrier V. Pasonage D.

Briefly, protein was incubated with 20 mml-ascorbate in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 5.3, for 0.5 h, and the reductant was removed by gel filtration.Biogenesis of the galactose oxidase cofactor from pregalactose oxidase and Cu(I) was conducted under argon purge in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7. Tetrakis(acetonitrile) Cu(I) hexafluorophosphate [Cu(I)(CH3CN)4·PF6] was dissolved in anaerobic acetonitrile immediately before addition of an aliquot of this solution to argon-purged pregalactose oxidase. After mixing, the pregalactose oxidase-Cu(I) solution was rapidly purged with pure oxygen. Quantitation of the oxygen stoichiometry for cofactor biogenesis was performed by adding aliquots of air-saturated buffer to a mixture containing pregalactose oxidase and a substoichiometric amount of Cu(I). The pregalactose oxidase-Cu(I) complex was prepared by combining 150 nmol of Cu(I)(CH3CN)4·PF6 with 600 nmol of pregalactose oxidase in a 3-ml anaerobic cuvette under argon. The optical absorption of the stirred solution was monitored at 445 nm.The mutual stability of pre-GAOXCu(I) and fully oxidized mature GAOX in a mixture containing both was determined by sequential preparation of a pre-GAOXCu(I) complex, addition of oxidized GAOX, and O2 in that order. Copper(I) acetonitrile (60 nmol, 0.6 eq) was added to an anaerobic solution of pre-GAOX (100 μm, 1 ml) under argon. An anaerobic solution of fully oxidized mature GAOX (AGAOX) (60 nmol in 50 μl) was added, and the optical absorption spectrum was recorded and monitored at 445 nm. The cuvette was then purged with O2 gas and the optical spectrum recorded.Copper analyses were performed using a Varian Instruments SpectrAA atomic absorption spectrometer equipped with a GTA 96 graphite furnace. Galactose oxidase activity was measured by oxygen uptake in a Clark-type oxygen electrode. The assay mixture contained 50 mmO-methyl-α-d-galactopyranoside, 2 mm K3Fe(CN)6, and 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7. The reaction was monitored at 25 °C, and the electrode was calibrated using the protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate dioxygenase reaction (41Whittaker M.M. Ballou D.P. Whittaker J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8426-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Spectroscopic Methods—Optical absorption spectra were measured using a Varian Instruments Cary 5E UV-visible near infrared absorption spectrophotometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were recorded on a Bruker E500 X-Band EPR spectrometer with a Super X microwave bridge and SHQ resonator equipped with a nitrogen flow cryostat. EPR signal quantitation was performed using Cu(II) perchlorate spin standard. First derivative solution EPR spectra were simulated using the program sim15 (Quantum Chemistry Program Exchange QCPE265). Solution EPR spectra were recorded for samples in a quartz flat cell (Wilmad Glass, Buena, NJ) at 305 K. Resonance Raman spectra were collected with a custom McPherson 2061/207 spectrograph (0.67-m focal length, 600 groove grating, 7 cm–1 spectral resolution) using a Coherent Inova 302 krypton laser (413 nm), a Kaiser optical super-notch filter, and a Princeton Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2-cooled CCD detector. Spectra were obtained for samples in glass capillaries at 300 K using a 90 ° scattering geometry and a 20-min accumulation time. Sample integrity was verified by the observation of the same absorption spectrum before and after laser irradiation.Transient Kinetics—The rate of formation of mature galactose oxidase from pregalactose oxidase and Cu(I) was measured using a Biologic SFM-300 rapid mixing stopped-flow module connected to an OLIS RSM-1000 rapid scanning monochromator via fiber optic light pipes. Prior to the rapid mixing experiment, the stopped-flow system was scrubbed free of oxygen using 50 ml of protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate dioxygenase mixture in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, for at least 24 h (42Patil P.V. Ballou D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 286: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). All syringes were periodically emptied and refilled with the scrubbing reagents. During this period the syringe chamber was purged with nitrogen gas, and the circulating water bath reservoir was sparged with nitrogen. Collars fitted around the syringe ports on the Biologic SFM-300 head permitted a continuous argon purge of these points. Anaerobic solutions delivered to the syringe block were prepared in gas-tight tonometers. Cu(I)(CH3CN)4·PF6 in acetonitrile was added to an anaerobic solution of pregalactose oxidase in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, that was subsequently transferred anaerobically to an argon-purged tonometer using a double-ended catheter needle. The cofactor biogenesis reaction was initiated by mixing this solution with oxygenated buffer in the stopped-flow system, monitoring the formation of fully oxidized cofactor-containing mature galactose oxidase. The pH sensitivity of the biogenesis reaction was investigated by shooting pregalactose oxidase/Cu(I) (prepared anaerobically in buffer-free water) against airsaturated 40 mm buffer solutions in the SFM-300 syringe driver. The buffer solutions used are as follows: pH 5.0–5.5, MES; pH 6.0–6.5, MES/MOPS mixture; pH 7.0, MOPS; pH 7.5–8.0, MOPS/CHES mixture; pH 8.5, CHES. Solvent kinetic isotope (SKIE) measurements were performed by shooting pregalactose oxidase/Cu(I) prepared as above in either H2O or D2O (containing 0.5 mm MOPS, pL = 7) against airsaturated buffers (50 mm before mixing) in H2O or D2O, adjusted to the same pL value by volumetric mixing of components. Global data analysis and kinetic model evaluation was performed using the program Specfit/32 (Spectrum Software Associates, Marlborough, MA).RESULTSProduction of Pregalactose Oxidase—P. pastoris transformants containing galactose oxidase cDNA linked to either A. niger glucoamylase leader peptide or S. cerevisiae αMF leader peptide coding sequences efficiently secrete mature galactose oxidase under methanol-induced expression in complete medium (31Whittaker M.M. Whittaker J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 20: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When copper supplementation was reduced in the glycerol batch growth phase and eliminated completely in the induction phase of high density methanol fermentation, the transformants produced pregalactose oxidase lacking the thioether cross-link between Cys228 and Tyr272 (Fig. 1) but exhibiting the N-terminal sequence (ASAPI) of the authentic mature protein. The yield of purified pregalactose oxidase was ∼200 mg/liter for a 5-liter fermentation culture harvested 1 day after induction. The background galactose oxidase activity of the purified pregalactose oxidase was about 0.1% (∼ 0.7 μmol of O2/mg of protein at 25 °C) of the recombinant WT galactose oxidase. Analysis of the sulfhydryl content of pregalactose oxidase using the DTNB assay (Table I) shows that two representative preparations of pre-enzyme contain approximately twice as many free SH groups as mature WT galactose oxidase, confirming the presence of an additional, predominantly unblocked cysteine residue (Cys228) in these preparations. The amount of free sulfhydryl varies somewhat between preparations.Table IAnalysis of free sulfhydryl content of galactose oxidase variantsVariantmol SH/mol proteinaSulfhydryl content determined by DTNB assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”WT apoGAOX0.76C228G GAOX0.89Y272G GAOX1.49Pre-GAOX (A)bDetermination of free sulfhydryl content for two independent pre-GAOX preparations.1.68Pre-GAOX (B)bDetermination of free sulfhydryl content for two independent pre-GAOX preparations.1.52a Sulfhydryl content determined by DTNB assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”b Determination of free sulfhydryl content for two independent pre-GAOX preparations. Open table in a new tab Detection of Cross-linked Product by SDS-PAGE—Mature, cross-linked cofactor-containing galactose oxidase shows an altered mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, lane 6) and is resolved from unmodified pregalactose oxidase (Fig. 2, lane 1), as reported previously (29Rogers M.S. Baron A.J. McPherson M.J. Knowles P.F. Dooley D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 990-991Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mature galactose oxidase appeared following addition of Cu(I)(CH3CN)4·PF6 to pregalactose oxidase under anaerobic conditions followed by oxygen gas purging (Fig. 2, lanes 2–5). The amount of mature product formed was roughly proportional to Cu(I) added up to about 0.8 eq (Table I, pre-GAOX(A)). Lower conversion was observed in some preparations (Table I, pre-GAOX(B)), in which the amount of cross-linked product was proportional to Cu(I) added only up to about 0.5 eq. Thus, the upper limit to conversion appears to vary somewhat between pre-enzyme preparations. Similar results were obtained by addition of Cu(II)SO4 to pre-galactose oxidase in the presence of oxygen (Fig. 2, lane 7). Varying the sample concentration (from micromolar to millimolar) did not change the yield, and the protein began to precipitate when more than 1 eq of copper was added. Unmodified pre-GAOX appears to be more sensitive to precipitation in excess copper than the mature GAOX protein. Treating pre-GAOX with ascorbic acid at low pH (a method for deblocking cysteine sulfenic acid groups, Cys-SOH) did not increase the yield of mature GAOX. Other attempts (varying salt concentration, pH, buffer, addition of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide scavengers, and repeating the Cu(I) treatment on the initially formed biogenesis product) also failed to increase the upper limit of conversion to the mature GAOX product.Fig. 2SDS-PAGE analysis of cross-link formation in the cofactor biogenesis reaction.Top, GelCode™-stained 12% SDS-PAGE (loaded with 0.5 μg of protein in each lane) resolving uncross-linked pre-GAOX and cross-linked mature GAOX product.

Diabetic retinopathy is the number one cause of blindness in humans between the ages of 20 and 74 years (1Klein R. Annu. Rev. Public Health. 1996; 17: 137-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Age-related macular degeneration is the predominant cause of blindness in the elderly population (2Harris A. Chung H.S. Ciulla T.A. Kagemann L. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 1999; 18: 669-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3O'Shea J.G. Med. J. Aust. 1996; 165: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although both diseases involve abnormal blood vessel growth in the eye, the mechanisms underlying this growth remain unknown. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels may be increased, and this up-regulation could initiate neovascularization (4Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). However, it appears that these disorders are much more complicated. Both diseases also have a potential for dysfunction of sympathetic nerve function. Patients with diabetes mellitus or advanced aging show both structural and functional indices of sympathetic neuropathy (5Ishikawa S. Bensaoula T. Uga S. Mukuno K. Ophthalmologica. 1985; 191: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 6Schmidt R.E. Beaudet L.N. Plurad S.B. Dorsey D.A. Brain Res. 1997; 769: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Fulk G.W. Bower A. McBride K. Boatright R. Optom. Vis. Sci. 1991; 68: 954-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) It has been suggested that diabetic neuropathy may contribute to dysfunctional wound healing (8Kim L.R. Whelpdale K. Zurowski M. Pomeranz B. Wound Repair Regen. 1998; 6: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and diabetic retinopathy (9Steinle J.J. Pierce J.D. Clancy R.L. Smith P.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Few studies have attempted to determine whether changes in sympathetic innervation may result in vascular complications, such as retinopathy or dysfunctional wound healing. Ocular angiogenesis in the posterior region likely comes from either choroidal or retinal vascular beds. The current opinion is that age-related macular degeneration results from choroidal neovascularization, which destroys retinal pigmented epithelial cells, and blood vessels that invade the photoreceptor layer (3O'Shea J.G. Med. J. Aust. 1996; 165: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Diabetic retinopathy, on the other hand, is thought to result from the abnormal growth of retinal blood vessels (1Klein R. Annu. Rev. Public Health. 1996; 17: 137-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both, however, produce a significant loss of vision or blindness. Although many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the abnormal vascular growth in both of these diseases, a definitive answer is not yet available. Most will agree that both of these diseases result from an imbalance of angiogenic versus angiostatic factors. While investigating sympathetic nerve regulation of choroidal blood flow, we found that blood flow to the treated eye increased over 4-fold following superior cervical ganglionectomy and was not altered in other cranial structures (9Steinle J.J. Pierce J.D. Clancy R.L. Smith P.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sympathectomy also produced significant increases in the number of choroidal venules and arterioles and the retinal capillaries in the outer nuclear layer (9Steinle J.J. Pierce J.D. Clancy R.L. Smith P.G. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 761-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, we determined that the β-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (which blocks β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors) produced changes in the choroid similar to those after a sympathectomy (10Steinle J.J. Smith P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because the β3-adrenergic receptor was thought to be found primarily in white and brown adipose tissues (11Krief S. Lonnqvist F. Raimbault S. Baude B. Van Spronsen A. Arner P. Strosberg A.D. Ricquier D. Emorine L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 344-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), we did not characterize the role of this receptor after sympathectomy. β-adrenergic receptor subtypes have been located on some types of endothelial cells (12Fredriksson J.M. Lindquist J.M. Bronnikov G.E. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13802-13811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 13Ferro A. Queen L.R. Priest R.M. Xu B. Ritter J.M. Poston L. Ward J.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine which subtypes of β-adrenergic receptors were present on retinal endothelial cells. We also characterized the signaling pathways associated with the activation of these receptors. Finally, we determined whether activation of β-adrenergic receptors in cultured retinal endothelial cells could mediate proliferation and migration, two markers of an angiogenic phenotype. Cell Culture—Human retinal endothelial cells were purchased from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA). Cells were used at passages 3–6 for all experiments. Cells were grown in attachment factor-coated dishes and maintained in serum-free medium (Cell Systems) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. After the cells reached 80–90% confluence, they were passaged with the use of a passage reagent group (Cell Systems). Starvation medium contained all of the above ingredients except that 0.1% bovine serum albumin was substituted for 10% serum. Human microvascular endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion of blood vessels taken from the mesentery of the small bowel and cloned by limiting dilution (designated MM1 cells). Endothelial cell identity was verified by positive staining for a factor VIII-related antigen. Pharmacological Activators and Inhibitors—Stimulation of the β3-adrenergic receptor was achieved by application of the specific receptor agonist BRL37344 (10 μm). Xamoterol (10 μm) was used as a specific β1-adrenergic receptor agonist. Both activators were obtained from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Protein kinases A and G were blocked with KT5720 (1 μm) and KT5823 (1 μm). Src was blocked by PP2 (1 μm), and the inactive isoform PP3 (1 μm) served as a negative control. Wortmannin (100 nm) or LY294002 (2 μm) were used to inhibit phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity; the inactive isoform LY303511 (100 μm) served as a negative control. The phosphatidylinositol ether analog 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate (10 μm), referred to as Akt-I 1The abbreviations used are: Akt-I, 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. in the remainder of the text, was used as a potent and selective inhibitor of Akt (protein kinase B). The MAP kinase pathway was blocked using the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 were blocked with MMP-2/MMP-9 inhibitor III (1 μm), abbreviated as MMP-I in the remainder of the text. All inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem, except wortmannin (Tocris, Ellisville, MO). β-Adrenergic Receptor Protein Expression—Western blotting was conducted to determine which β-adrenergic receptor subtypes were present on retinal endothelial cells (REC; passage 3–6), choroidal endothelial cells (ChEC; passage 2–6), or human microvascular mesenteric endothelial cells (MM1; passage 10–15). Cells in 60-mm dishes were lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and 1 mm Na3VO4,1mm NaF, and 0.1% SDS), and 50 μg of protein was separated on a 4–12% pre-cast polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with Super BlockTM (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies to the β1-(A-20; 5 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), β2-(H-73; 5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or β3-adrenergic receptor (C-20; 5 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were applied overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies applied at a 1:10,000 dilution for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (LumniGlo, Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) using Kodak BioMax ML film and scanned into the computer using reflectance scanning. Western blots to evaluate the phosphorylation states of MAPK (phospho p42/44,1:1000, ERK1/2, Cell Signaling), Src (phospho Src-416, 1:1000, Cell Signaling), or Akt (phospho-Akt, Ser473, 1:1000, BIO-SOURCE) were done as described above following stimulation of the β3-adrenergic receptor. Radioligand Binding Assays—β-adrenergic subtype levels were quantified on intact human retinal endothelial cells by modification of previously described methods (14Toews M.L. Harden T.K. Perkins J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 3553-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Muzzin P. Revelli J.P. Fraser C.M. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the hydrophilic β-adrenoreceptor ligand (—)[5,7-3H]CGP 12177 (33 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To prevent receptor internalization, binding studies were performed at 4 °C. Cells were grown in 12-well plates and serum-starved for 24 h. For determination of saturation binding, cells were incubated in 0.3 ml of serum-free medium (1% protease-free bovine serum albumin, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 at 4 °C), 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) and increasing amounts of [3H]CGP 12177 per well. To assess displacement of [3H]CGP 12177 binding by the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist BRL37344 and the β1/2-receptor antagonist propranolol, cells were incubated with 25 nm [3H]CGP 12177. Three wells of cells were used per condition, and all binding assays were performed three times. Binding was carried out for 6 h, as preliminary studies established that equilibrium binding was reached at that time. Afterward, the binding medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were digested by incubation at 22 °C for 10 min in 0.5 ml of 1% Triton X-100 with 1% bovine serum albumin. Radioactivity in cell digests was measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS6500), using Ecolite(+) mixture (ICN Pharmaceuticals). Specific [3H]CGP 12177 binding was defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding, with the latter determined by incubating cells with various concentrations of [3H]CGP 12177 and 100 μm nonlabeled ligand. Data obtained from the saturation binding experiments were analyzed by Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software). Binding results were best fitted to a two-site model (r2 = 0.89 ± 0.05), which was verified by Scatchard analysis. Retinal Endothelial Cell Migration—All migration assays were done using BD BioCoat angiogenesis system endothelial cell invasion plates (BD Biosciences) according to supplied protocols with little variation. Briefly, 100,000 retinal endothelial cells were added to top chambers in 250 μl of medium. Starvation medium, agonists, and inhibitors were added to each of the lower chambers. All inhibitors were added for 30 min before agonist application to allow for complete pathway blockade. No cells were added to the bottom chamber so that background fluorescence could be subtracted from post-migration values. Plates were allowed to incubate for 26–29 h at 37 °C to allow for migration through the Matrigel-coated membrane. Chambers were transferred to wells containing calcein AM, a fluorophore taken up by cells that have invaded the membrane (16Braut-Boucher F. Pichon J. Rat P. Adolphe M. Aubery M. Font J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Yang A. Cardona D.L. Barile F.A. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 2002; 18: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), in Hank's balanced salt solution for 1.5 h and then read on a fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, Model FL600, gain of 100) at 485/530 nm. Migration of cells was expressed as a percentage of control (those receiving only starvation medium) after background fluorescence was subtracted. Data were analyzed using Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) and presented with significance at p < 0.05. Proliferation Assay—Endothelial cell proliferation was assessed using an assay based on the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt WST-1 to formazan by cellular mitochondrial dehydrogenases. Expansion in the number of viable cells results in an increase in the overall activity of the mitochondrial dehydrogenases in the sample. The augmentation in enzyme activity leads to an increase in the formazan dye formed. The formazan dye produced by viable cells can be quantified by a multiwell spectrophotometer by measuring the absorbance of the dye solution at 440 nm. To perform the experiments, an aliquot of 50,000 retinal endothelial cells was added to each well of a 96-well tray in medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. After cells attached to the 96-well tray, the cells were washed, and high serum medium was replaced with starvation medium overnight. All wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Negative control wells received starvation medium, and positive control wells received agonist only. Inhibitors were added 30 min prior to application of an agonist to allow for complete blockade. Controls treated with inhibitor alone were also included to determine their effect on proliferation. Cells were allowed to incubate for 48 h. At this time, the WST-1 reagent, dissolved in Electro Coupling Solution (Chemicon), was applied for 4 h to measure cell proliferation. The plates were read on a spectrophotometer, and data were presented as a percentage of negative control proliferation with p < 0.05 being significant. β-Adrenergic Receptor Expression in Endothelial Cells—The β3-adrenergic receptor protein was detected in lysates of human retinal endothelial cells but not in human microvascular mesenteric endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). No protein expression of β2-adrenergic receptor protein was observed in retinal endothelial cells, whereas choroidal endothelial cells had β2-adrenergic receptor expression (Fig. 1B). The β1-adrenergic receptor protein was noted in four different human retinal endothelial cell lysates (Fig. 1C). Binding of [3H]CGP 12177 to Human Retinal Endothelial Cells—Saturation radioligand binding studies were performed to quantify the levels of β-adrenergic receptor subtypes on human retinal endothelial cells. Fig. 2A shows the specific binding of the hydrophilic β-adrenoreceptor ligand [3H]CGP 12177 to human retinal endothelial cells. Analysis of the saturation binding results revealed the presence of two populations of binding sites with high and low affinity for [3H]CGP 12177. The Kd of the high affinity site was determined to be 0.06 ± 0.02 nM (n = 3), and the Kd of the low affinity site was 25 ± 4 nM (n = 3). The presence of two populations of [3H]CGP 12177 binding sites of high and low affinity was confirmed by Scatchard analysis (Fig. 2B). The total number (Bmax) of high and low affinity binding sites was determined to be 0.037 ± 0.003 and 0.071 ± 0.023 fmol/μg protein, respectively. Based on comparable Kd values reported by others (15Muzzin P. Revelli J.P. Fraser C.M. Giacobino J.P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the high and low affinity sites would represent binding of [3H]CGP 12177 to β1- and β3-adrenergic receptors, respectively. Using a concentration of [3H]CGP 12177 equal to the Kd of the low affinity binding site (25 nM), the β3-adrenergic receptor agonist BRL37344 at 10 μM displaced 37.0 ± 5.3% of specific radioligand binding. The remainder of the specific binding was displaceable with the β1/2-receptor antagonist, propranolol. Stimulation of β3-Adrenergic Receptors with BRL37344 Phosphorylates Several Known Signaling Molecules—Administration of BRL37344 produced significant phosphorylation of Akt versus non-treated retinal endothelial cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, activation of β3-adrenergic receptors also increased phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 (Fig. 3, C and D) and Src (Fig. 3, E and F; *, p < 0.05 versus non-treated controls). β3-Adrenergic Receptor But Not β1-Adrenergic Receptor Stimulation Increases Retinal Endothelial Cell Migration—Activation of the β3-receptor produced a 43 ± 7% increase in retinal endothelial cell migration (p < 0.001, Fig. 4A). This could be attenuated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) with either LY294002 (p < 0.001) or wortmannin (p < 0.001), whereas the non-active isoform LY303511 had no effect. Retinal endothelial cell migration elicited by β3-adrenergic receptor activation was also diminished by inhibition of Akt (p < 0.05), MMP2/MMP9 (p < 0.001), or MEK (p < 0.01). Migration induced by BRL3744 was not diminished in the presence of blockers of protein kinase A, protein kinase G, or Src. With the exception of MMP-I, the inhibitors alone had no significant effect on migration (Fig. 4B). Treatment of retinal endothelial cells with the β1-adrenergic agonist xamoterol did not produce a significant increase in migration over control values. β3-Adrenergic Receptor But Not β1-Receptor Activation Promotes Retinal Endothelial Cell Proliferation—Stimulation of β3-adrenergic receptors on retinal endothelial cells with BRL37344 produced a 28 ± 4% increase in proliferation (p < 0.001, Fig. 5A). This proliferation could be completely blocked by inhibitors of Src (p < 0.01), PI3K (LY294002, p < 0.01; wortmannin, p < 0.001), or MEK (p < 0.001). The administration of Akt-I, KT5720, or KT5823 did not abolish the BRL37344-stimulated retinal endothelial cell proliferation. No pharmacological agents altered proliferation when given in the absence of BRL37344 (Fig. 5B). Stimulation of β1-adrenergic receptors with xamoterol did not significantly affect retinal endothelial cell proliferation (Fig. 5C). β3-Adrenergic Receptors in Retinal Endothelial Cells—β3-adrenergic receptors have been reported to be located primarily in thermogenic or fat tissues. Because we had previous data to support a role for β-adrenergic control of ocular blood vessel growth (10Steinle J.J. Smith P.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine which β-adrenergic subtypes were present in cultured retinal endothelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate protein expression for β3-adrenergic receptors in human retinal endothelial cells (Fig. 1). Protein expression for the β1-adrenergic receptor was observed; however, no expression of β2-adrenergic receptor by Western blotting was noted. The observation of both β1- and β3-adrenergic receptors on retinal endothelial cells was supported by radioligand binding studies (Fig. 2). These results led us to question whether activation of β3- or β1-rececptors would mediate retinal endothelial cell migration and proliferation. β3-Adrenergic Receptors in Retinal Endothelial Cell Proliferation—Others have noted that β3-adrenergic receptors linked to G-coupled proteins promote phosphorylation of Src and the subsequent activation of ERK1/2 of the MAPK pathway (18de Souza C.J. Burkey B.F. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1433-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in adipose tissue. It was assumed that this activation was responsible for lipolysis and thermoregulation. Activation of these receptors in retinal endothelial cells by BRL37344 promoted a similar response (Fig. 5A), which was comparable with that noted in response to Eph B4 stimulation. 2Steinle, J. J., Meininger, C. J., Chowdhury, U., Wu, G., and Granger, H. J. (2003) Cell. Signal., in press. Since LY294002 and wortmannin prevented retinal endothelial cell proliferation, it is clear that PI3K is involved. LY294002 and wortmannin prevented cell proliferation, it is clear that PI3K is involved. It has been reported that Src can phosphorylate PI3K in addition to activating ERK1/2 (19Liebmann C. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) in receptors linked to G-proteins. Therefore, this may be the pathway for ERK1/2 regulation of retinal endothelial cell proliferation after the administration of BRL37344. Although ERK1/2 can be stimulated via nitric oxide production and protein kinase G activation after Akt phosphorylation (20Steinle J.J. Meininger C.J. Wu G. Wu M.H. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43830-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), this is not likely in these retinal endothelial cells, because neither the Akt-inhibitor or KT5823 blocked proliferation. Furthermore, the protein kinase A inhibitor KT5720 did not affect proliferation, suggesting that cAMP is not involved in retinal endothelial cell proliferation following β3-adrenergic receptor stimulation. Stimulation of cultured retinal endothelial cells with xamoterol, a β1-adrenergic receptor agonist, did not stimulate proliferation. Therefore, β3-adrenergic receptors appear to mediate the changes in retinal endothelial cell proliferation via Src, PI3K, and MAPK, whereas Akt, protein kinase G, protein kinase A, and β1-adrenergic receptors have little effect. β3-Adrenergic Receptor-mediated Migration of Retinal Endothelial Cells—Relative to proliferation, much less has been demonstrated for the role of G-protein-coupled receptors in cell migration. Using BRL37344 to stimulate the β3-adrenergic receptors on retinal endothelial cells, we showed that these receptors could regulate migration. Stimulation increased migration through a Matrigel-coated membrane by >37%. The increased migration in response to BRL37344 is similar to that noted after Eph B4 treatment of this same cell type. 3J. J. Steinle, C. J. Meininger, U. Chowdhury, G. Wu, and H. J. Granger, submitted for publication. The BRL37344-mediated migration could be antagonized by prior administration of inhibitors of PI3K, Akt, MEK, and MMP-2/MMP-9. PI3K appears to be directly linked to the β3-adrenergic receptor. Similar signaling designs have been reported previously in models of heart disease and β-adrenergic receptors (21Naga Prasad S.V. Nienaber J. Rockman H.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: S44-S49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). β-adrenergic receptors may exhibit kinase activity and are designated as βARK. In this situation, βARK recruits PI3K to the plasma membrane of the myocardium and leads to its phosphorylation (21Naga Prasad S.V. Nienaber J. Rockman H.A. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: S44-S49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PI3K is then able to phosphorylate Akt and lead to the induction of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 (20Steinle J.J. Meininger C.J. Wu G. Wu M.H. Granger H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43830-43835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Additionally, Akt can activate ERK1/2 of the MAPK pathway, as occurs in retinal endothelial cells stimulated with Eph B4.2 The Src inhibitor PP2 did not alter retinal endothelial cell migration. Unlike what was observed with proliferation, G-protein-coupled phosphorylation of Src does not initiate the signaling for migration. As was noted in retinal endothelial cell proliferation, activation of the β1-adrenergic receptors does not appear to modulate cell migration. Thus, it appears that β3-adrenergic receptors, not β1-adrenergic receptors, are involved in retinal endothelial cell migration via PI3K, Akt, MMP 2 or 9, and ERK1/2. The results from these studies demonstrate for the first time that β3-adrenergic receptors exist on human retinal endothelial cells. Alterations in sympathetic nerve activity may contribute to vascular complications of diabetes. It may be that diabetic retinopathy results from changes in β3-adrenergic receptor signaling. If these in vitro studies on cultured cells can be extrapolated to the intact retinal circulation, then the signaling of β3-adrenergic receptors may be capable of initiating retinal endothelial cell proliferation and migration, both of which are critical stages of angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2022455607,"Vascular permeability factor/vascular endothelial growth factor (VPF/VEGF) functions by activating two receptor-tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2), both of which are selectively expressed on primary vascular endothelium. KDR is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation and migration, whereas Flt-1 down-modulates KDR-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. Our most recent works show that pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins and Gβγ subunits are required for Flt-1-mediated down-regulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) proliferation and that Gq/11 proteins are required for KDR-mediated RhoA activation and HUVEC migration. In this study, we demonstrate that Gq/11 proteins are also required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation. Our results further indicate that Gq/11 proteins specifically mediate KDR signaling such as intracellular Ca2+ mobilization rather than Flt-1-induced CDC42 activation and that a Gq/11 antisense oligonucleotide completely inhibits MAPK phosphorylation induced by KDR but has no effect on Flt-1-induced MAPK activation. More importantly, we demonstrate that Gq/11 proteins interact with KDR in vivo, and the interaction of Gq/11 proteins with KDR does not require KDR tyrosine phosphorylation. Surprisingly, the Gq/11 antisense oligonucleotide completely inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated KDR phosphorylation. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of G11 but not Gq can cause phosphorylation of KDR and MAPK. In addition, a Gβγ minigene, hβARK1(495), inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation, MAPK phosphorylation, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization but has no effect on KDR phosphorylation. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Gq/11 proteins mediate KDR tyrosine phosphorylation and KDR-mediated HUVEC proliferation through interaction with KDR.

Among these, VPF/VEGF stands out because of its potency and selectivity for vascular endothelium. VPF/VEGF is not only involved in several steps of angiogenesis but is also the only angiogenic factor recognized to date that renders microvessels hyperpermeable to circulating macromolecules (4Dvorak H.F.

VPF/VEGF extensively reprograms endothelial cell expression of proteases, integrins, and glucose transporters; stimulates endothelial cell migration and division; and protects endothelial cells from apoptosis and senescence (9Leung D.W.

Most VPF/VEGF biological activities are mediated by its interaction with two high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases, Flt-1 (VEGFR-1) and KDR (VEGFR-2, FLK-1 in mice) (13Fong G.H. Rossant J.

A third receptor, neuropilin, which binds to VEGF165 but not VEGF121, has been recognized, but less is known about neuropilin's capacity to initiate endothelial cell signaling (18Soker S.

A large body of work has demonstrated that KDR, not Flt-1, is responsible for VPF/VEGF-stimulated cell proliferation and migration in cultured EC and for microvascular permeability (20Waltenberger J.

However, Flt-1 functions to down-regulate KDR-mediated cultured EC proliferation as shown by two different VPF/VEGF receptor chimeric fusion systems in which the N-terminal domains of KDR and Flt-1 were replaced by the N-terminal domain of either epidermal growth factor receptor or colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (23Rahimi N.

Further studies indicated that the signaling pathway required for Flt-1-mediated down-regulation of EC proliferation involves activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, small GTPase Rac1, CDC42, and, surprisingly, pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins (24Zeng H.

Whereas PLC activation is involved in VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation and migration, intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and MAPK are required for VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation but not migration (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have shown that the Gq/11 family of the heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins and Gβγ subunits mediate VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC migration through the small GTPase RhoA (33Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether G protein Gq/11 proteins are involved in VPF/VEGF-stimulated proliferation. In this study, we show for the first time that inhibition of Gq/11 protein expression by a Gq/11-specific antisense oligonucleotide blocked VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation and activation of signaling molecules in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC that are mediated by KDR, not by Flt-1. Moreover, Gq/11 proteins are not activated by tyrosine phosphorylation but through physical interaction with KDR. Surprisingly, the interaction of Gq/11 proteins with KDR does not require KDR tyrosine phosphorylation, and the Gq/11-specific antisense oligonucleotide blocks the interaction of Gq/11 with KDR and inhibits KDR phosphorylation. Furthermore, the Gα11 constitutively active mutant, Gα11(G209L), not the Gαq constitutively active mutant, Gαq(G209L), activates phosphorylation of KDR and MAPK. However, expression of the Gβγ minigene, hβARK1(495), inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation, MAPK phosphorylation, and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization but has no effect on KDR phosphorylation. Materials—Recombinant VPF/VEGF was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The EGM-MV Bullet kit, trypsin-EDTA, and trypsin neutralization solution were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). Vitrogen 100 was purchased from Collagen Biomaterials (Palo Alto, CA).

Overexpression of Proteins in HUVEC—Retrovirus preparation and HUVEC infection with retrovirus were carried out as described (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

DNA transfection was carried out with the EffecteneTM transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Two μg of each target gene (pMMP-EGDR, pMMP-LacZ, etc.), 1.5 μg of pMD.MLV gag.pol, and 0.5 μg of pMD.G DNA, encoding the cDNAs of the proteins that are required for virus packaging (kindly provided by Dr. Mulligan), were mixed in 300 μl of EC buffer. 32 μl of enhancer was added to the DNA mixture. After incubation at room temperature for 2 min, 30 μl of Effectene was added to the DNA mixture and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The DNA mixture was added dropwise to 293T cells. The medium was changed after 16 h. The retrovirus was isolated 48 h after transfection and used immediately for infection or frozen at -70 °C. 24 h before infection, HUVECs were seeded at a density of 0.3 × 106 cells/100-mm plate. 1 ml of retrovirus solution (∼2 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml) and 5 ml of fresh medium were added to cells with 10 μg/ml polybrene. The medium was changed after 16 h, and cells were ready for experiments 48 h after infection. The expression plasmids containing Gαq, Gαq(Q209L), Gα11, and Gα11(209L) cDNAs were obtained from Guthrie cDNA Resource Center, Guthrie Research Institute (Sayre, PA). Transfection of plasmids to HUVEC was carried out as described (34Paik J.H. Chae S. Lee M.J. Thangada S. Hla T. J. Biol.

Garzon J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 820-827PubMed Google Scholar), were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (Genemed Synthesis, South San Francisco, CA). Proliferation Assays—Assays were carried out as described (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC (with or without oligonucleotide transfection) were serum-starved (0.1% serum) for 24 h and then stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF for 20 h. 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and 4 h later the cells were washed, fixed, and lysed. Data were expressed as -fold activation with the stimulated cells compared with control treated cells. The data shown represent the means with S.D. of triplicate determinations per experimental condition, and the experiments were repeated at least three times. Intracellular Ca2+Release—Serum-starved HUVEC with or without transfection were loaded with Fura-2 AM and stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF. The assay was carried out as described (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 33Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol.

CDC42 Activation Assays—The CDC42 activity assay was carried out as described (25Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-h serum-starved HUVEC with or without oligonucleotide transfection were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF for 1 min. Cells were washed and lysed. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of freshly prepared GST-Pak-CRIB beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The proteins bound to beads were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with antibodies against CDC42. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HUVEC, with or without virus infection or oligonucleotide transfection, were serum-starved for 24 h and stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or EGF as indicated for various time periods. Stimulation was halted by the addition of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5% aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cell lysates were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. One mg of lysate protein was incubated with antibodies as indicated for 1 h, and with 50 μl of protein A-conjugated agarose beads at 4 °C for another 1 h. For immunoprecipitation with phosphorylated tyrosine, cellular extracts were incubated with agarose-conjugated antiphosphorylated tyrosine for 2 h. Beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation buffer three times, and immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis. For the experiments with pertussis toxin, this was added 16 h before stimulation. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Requirement of Gq/11Proteins for DNA Synthesis in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC—In order to examine whether Gq/11 is involved in VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC DNA synthesis, we utilized a Gq/11-specific oligonucleotide that has been previously shown by us to inhibit VPF/VEGF-induced HUVEC migration (33Zeng H. Sanyal S. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32714-32719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The Gq/11 antisense oligonucleotide specifically blocks expression of both Gαq and Gα11, as shown by Western blot analysis using an antibody that recognizes both Gαq and Gα11 (Fig. 1a, top panel). However, this has no effect on the expression of the Gi/o family of G proteins (Fig. 1a, middle panels). To rule out the possibility that any effect of the Gq/11 antisense on KDR signaling is due to inhibition of KDR expression, equal amounts of cellular extracts from HUVEC with or without transfection of ODN-Gq/11 or ODN-RD were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody against KDR. The data show that ODN-Gq/11 has no effect on KDR expression (Fig. 1a, bottom panel). Then we determined the effect of the Gq/11 antisense oligonucleotide on KDR-mediated DNA synthesis in HUVEC. HUVEC were transfected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phosphorothioate ODN-Gq/11 with a method that gave out almost 100% transfection yield as described before (36Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46791-46798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and subjected to a DNA synthesis assay with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF or bFGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 1b, antisense oligonucleotide ODN-Gq/11 almost completely inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated but has no effect on bFGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in HUVEC. However, the control oligonucleotide, OND-RD (36Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46791-46798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), has no effect. These data clearly indicate that Gq/11 proteins are required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated DNA synthesis in HUVEC. Gq/11Proteins Are Required for the KDR-mediated, Not Flt-1-mediated, Signaling Pathway in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC—Next, we examined the effect of ODN-Gq/11 on the activation of signaling molecules mediated by KDR and Flt-1. As shown in Fig. 2a, ODN-Gq/11, not the control ODN-RD, completely inhibits intracellular Ca2+ mobilization that is mediated by KDR but not Flt-1 (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Flt-1, but not KDR, can activate CDC42, a member of the Rho family of small GTPases (25Zeng H. Zhao D. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4003-4009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effect of ODN-Gq/11 on CDC42 activation. To do this, serumstarved HUVEC that were transfected with ODN-Gq/11 or nontransfected were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 1 min, and cellular extracts were subjected to a CDC42 activation assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data indicate that ODN-Gq/11 has no effect on CDC42 activation (Fig. 2b). It is known that MAPK phosphorylation is required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC proliferation (24Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 27Petrova T.V. Makinen T. Alitalo K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 29Takahashi T. Ueno H. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2221-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 30Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Ozes O.N. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6059-6062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Gq/11 proteins are required for VPF/VEGF-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation in HUVEC. Serum-starved HUVEC, which were transfected with either ODN-Gq/11 or ODN-RD or nontransfected, were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 10 min. Cellular extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using an antibody specifically against phosphorylated MAPK. Surprisingly, ODN-Gq/11 partially inhibits VPF/VEGF-stimulated MAPK phosphorylation in HUVEC, whereas ODN-RD has no effect (Fig. 3a). Similar results were also obtained when cells were treated with VPF/VEGF for 15 and 30 min (data not shown). Because both KDR and Flt-1 are present in HUVEC, in order to further characterize the partial inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation by the Gq/11 antisense oligonucleotide, we used the recently developed chimeric receptors, EGDR and EGLT, in which the extracellular domains of KDR and Flt-1 were replaced with that of epidermal growth factor receptor. Serum-starved HUVEC with or without transduction of LacZ as a control, EGDR, or EGLT was stimulated with VPF/VEGF or EGF for the indicated time. Cellular extracts were used to determine the levels of phosphorylated MAPK. As shown in Fig. 3b, both EGDR and EGLT can mediate MAPK phosphorylation; however, HUVEC transduced with LacZ do not show any detectable MAPK phosphorylation. Furthermore, we used this receptor chimera system to further confirm whether ODN-Gq/11 inhibits only KDR-mediated and not Flt-1-mediated MAPK phosphorylation. EGDR/HUVEC and EGLT/HUVEC, transfected with either ODN-Gq/11 or pertussis toxin, were stimulated with EGF for 10 min. Cellular extracts were used to determine MAPK phosphorylation. The data show that ODN-Gq/11 completely inhibits EGDR-mediated MAPK phosphorylation but has no effect on MAPK phosphorylation mediated by EGLT (Fig. 3c). Moreover, our data also demonstrate that pertussis toxin completely inhibits Flt-1-mediated MAPK phosphorylation but has no effect on KDR-mediated MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3c). These results indicate that Gq/11 proteins are required for KDR-mediated signaling pathways and that pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o proteins are required for Flt-1 signaling. VPF/VEGF Stimulates Interaction between KDR and Gq/11but Not Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Gq/11—Recently, it was reported that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Gi protein (37Alderton F.

Therefore, we tested whether VPF/VEGF could stimulate Gq/11 phosphorylation. Serum-starved HUVEC were stimulated with VPF/VEGF for 20 s, 40 s, 1 min, and 2 min as indicated. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against phosphorylated tyrosine, and the immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis using antibodies against KDR and Gq/11. The results show that Gq/11 is not phosphorylated (Fig. 4, bottom panel), whereas KDR is phosphorylated at 1 min (Fig. 4, top panel). These results indicate that Gq/11 proteins are not activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In G protein-coupling receptor signaling pathways, G proteins are activated by its interaction with the G protein-coupling receptor. Therefore, we tested whether Gq/11 proteins interact with KDR in VPF/VEGF-stimulated HUVEC. HUVEC were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VPF/VEGF for 5, 10, and 20 s. Cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Gαq/11, and the immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with an antibody against KDR. The data show that VPF/VEGF stimulates interaction between KDR and Gαq/11 as early as 5 s after treatment and that this interaction is transient (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, when cellular extracts from serum-starved HUVEC transfected with ODN-Gq/11 or ODN-RD were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against Gq/11 and then immunoblotted with an antibody a"

The major pathway in mammalian cells dedicated to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks is by the nonhomologous end-joining machinery. Six components function in this pathway, of which three (Ku70, Ku86, and DNA-PKcs) constitute a protein complex known as DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). However, it is now recognized that the cellular radiation response is complex, and radiosensitivity may be also regulated at different levels in the radiation signal transduction pathway. In addition to DNA damage, exposure to IR triggers intracellular signaling cascades that overlap with pathways initiated by ligand engagement to a receptor. In this study, we provide evidence for the novel localization of the DNA-PK complex in lipid rafts. We also show this property is not a generalized characteristic of all DNA repair proteins. Furthermore, we have detected Ku86 in yeast lipid rafts. Our results suggest that the components of this complex might be recruited separately to the plasma membrane by tethering with raft-resident proteins. In addition, we found an irradiation-induced differential protein phosphorylation pattern dependent upon DNA-PKcs in lipid rafts. Thus, we speculate that another role for the DNA-PKcs subunit and perhaps for the holoenzyme is in the signal transduction of IR response.

One of the most damaging lesions that can occur in a cell is a DNA double-strand break (DSB), 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; DSBR, DNA double-strand break repair; IR, ionizing irradiation; NHEJ, nonhomologous end-joining machinery; DIG, detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complex; PKC, protein kinase C; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; MCBD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; Ab, antibody; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. because it disrupts both strands of the DNA molecule. The importance of rescuing the cell from this lesion is evident by the existence of evolutionarily conserved DNA repair systems that act upon DSBs that are generated under physiological conditions, such as during transposition, meiosis, and recombination, or by external insults like ionizing irradiation (IR) exposure. The major pathway in mammalian cells dedicated to the repair of DSBs is by the nonhomologous end-joining machinery (NHEJ). Six components function in this pathway, of which three (Ku70, Ku86, and DNA-PKcs) constitute a protein complex, termed DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (for reviews, see Refs. 1Anderson C.W.

Human Press, Totowa, NJ1998Google Scholar), which in turn supports radiation-induced cascades emanating in the membrane and mediated by the activation of cytoplasmic molecules. In the same context, a signaling pathway conserved from yeast to humans associated with the response to diverse stresses involves the generation of ceramide from sphingomyelin by, at least in part, the action of sphingomyelinase (38Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). It is now becoming clear that lipid microenvironments on the cell surface, known as detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched complexes (DIGs) or lipid rafts, also take part in signal transduction processes. This lipid environment favors specific protein-protein interactions between ligands, receptors, and kinases, resulting in the activation of signaling cascades (for reviews, see Refs. 39Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar, 40Dobrowsky R.T.

Proteins incorporated into DIGs fall into different categories: glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, transmembrane proteins, doubly acylated tyrosine kinases of the Src family, and the α-subunit of heteromeric GTP-binding proteins and cholesterol linked proteins like Hedgehog (for a review, see Ref. 43Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). Curiously, another member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family, which has been also associated with the response to IR, the ATM protein, has been reported to localize outside the nucleus in cytoplasmic and membrane-associated vesicles (44Yan J. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2000; 76: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Results from the same study showed that lymphoblast cells from patients carrying a mutation in the ATM gene (locus associated with a human hereditary disease known as ataxia telangiectasia) were defective in the IR-induced activation of a raft-resident protein-tyrosine kinase p53/56 Lyn. In this study, we provide evidence for the localization of the DNA-PK complex in lipid raft of mammalian cells but not as a generalized characteristic of NHEJ factors. Furthermore, the localization of Ku86 in lipid rafts is conserved in yeast. Because the protein phosphorylation pattern after irradiation is different in lipid rafts isolated from DNA-PKcs-defective cells compared with controls, we are tempted to speculate that besides the role that the DNA-PK has in the DSBR pathway in mammalians, this complex might be involved in signal transduction of IR response. Materials—The protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, bestatin, and Pefabloc™ were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Density gradient centrifugation medium Optiprep™ was purchased from Nycomed Pharma AS (Oslo, Norway). Primary antibodies against Ku86, Ku70, Lyn, MSH2, MSH6, XRCC-4, and caveolin-1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); antibodies against DNA-PKcs were from Kamiya Biomedical Co.; antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase β1 subunit were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); antibodies against α-tubulin were from Sigma; antibodies against calnexin were from Stressgene; and antibodies against BLM were from Serotec. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse IgG were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and antibodies against goat IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibody generated in rat and directed against the C-terminal part of yeast Ku86 was a gift from Dr. Heidi Feldmann (Institut fuer Biochemie der Universitate Muenchen, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Buffers and Reagents—The following buffers were used: TNE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA); TNEX (TNE containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100); TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl); TBST (TBS with 0.1% (v/v) Tween). The mixture of inhibitors of proteases was as follows: 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin; 40 μg/ml bestatin, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC. The mixture of inhibitors of phosphatases was as follows: 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm disodium β-glydcerolphosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride. Cell Culture—The xrs-6 cell line was derived from the CHO-K1 cell line on the basis of its sensitivity to IR due to a defect in Ku86 (52Mizuta R. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). MO57J and MO57K were isolated from different areas of a glioblastoma tumor and further characterized. MO57J is radiosensitive due to a defect in DNA-PKcs as described elsewhere (50Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, glutamine, and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). Preparation of Microsomal Fraction—Cells (∼5 × 107) were detached with trypsin, washed with ice-cold PBS, and homogenized by Dounce disruption at 4 °C in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, EDTA 5 mm with protease inhibitors. Cell integrity was checked under microscope using an exclusion dye trypan blue. Before centrifugation at 700 × g, the solution was brought up to 440 mm sucrose. The postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged further, first at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria, and this supernatant was centrifuged again at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet (microsomal fraction) was separated from the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) and resuspended in 500 μl of the above buffer containing sucrose and stored at –80 °C. Conditions such as high salt or extreme pH (pH 11.5), which disrupt protein-protein interactions, cause dissociation of membrane-associated proteins but have minimal effects on integral membrane proteins. Treatment (100 μl of the microsome fraction) was performed on ice for 1 h, membranes were centrifuged at 120,000 × g, and pellet was separated from supernatant. Pellet was resuspended in 140 μl of the above buffer containing sucrose. An equal amount of protein (3 μg) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Supernatant was dialyzed against cold PBS for 2 h, and protein was precipitated by adding 2 volumes of ethanol and incubating overnight at –20 °C. After centrifugation for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was removed, the pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of loading buffer, and an equal volume (40 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Isolation of Lipid Rafts—Because of their high lipid content (sphingolipid and cholesterol), lipid rafts or DIGs are insoluble in the detergent Triton X-100 at 4 °C (but soluble at 37 °C), and they float to a low density during gradient centrifugation. We prepared lipid rafts using the method described by Bagnat et al. (79Bagnat M. Keranen S. Shevchenko A. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3254-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 1–2 × 107 adherent cells were detached by trypsination and washed in PBS, and the cell pellet was homogenized in TNE supplemented with Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% (v/v) in the presence of a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubated for 30 min on ice. Extracts were brought to 40% Optiprep (Nycomed Pharma, Oslo, Norway) and overlaid with 2 volumes of 30% Optiprep in TNEX and a top layer of 1 volume of TNEX. Samples were spun for 5 h at 4 °C either in a RP55.5 rotor at 55,000 rpm (5 × 106 cells) or in a SW55.1 rotor at 45,000 rpm (1–3 × 107 cells). Fractions of 200–400 μl were collected from the top of the gradient. DIGs are present in fractions 1–4, and the soluble component is represented by fractions 9–12. Western Blots—Whole cell extracts or lipid rafts fraction (20 μl) were boiled in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE (5 or 10% polyacrylamide). When fraction volume needed to be increased (60 μl), precipitation with 2 volumes of ethanol and incubation at –20 °C overnight was performed. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by using a wet apparatus and blocked for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C with 5% (w/v) skim milk (Carnation) in TBST buffer solution. The primary antibodies were used at a 1:500 dilution for Lyn (SC 44), Ku80 (SC M-20), Ku70 (SC M-19), EGFR (SC-03), and XRCC-4 (SC-8285); at a 1:1000 dilution for caveolin-1 (SC N-20), Na+/K+-ATPase β1 subunit (05-382), and calnexin (SPA-865); at a 1:5000 dilution for DNA-PKcs (MC-365); and at a 1:200 dilution for MSH2 (SC-494) and MSH6 (SC-10798) in 1% milk TBST buffer solution. For α-tubulin (T9026) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer solution. All incubations were for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After the incubation, blots were washed extensively in TBST, anti-rabbit (NA934), or anti-mouse (NA931) IgG secondary antibodies (Abs) were added at a dilution of 1:10,000, and anti-goat IgG (SC-2020) was added at 1:5000 in the same solution as the primary Ab and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The filter was washed in TBST and developed with an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). [32P]Orthophosphate Metabolic Labeling—Cells were detached with trypsin, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose PO4 medium (Invitrogen) without serum, and irradiated with 500 rads (5 grays). After irradiation, cells were recovered for 2 h. at 37 °C in rotator, and an aliquot 5–6 × 106 cells was resuspended in 1 ml of the same medium containing 1 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (PerkinElmer). Cells were washed in PBS, and the pellet was stored at –80 °C. Preparation of lipid rafts was performed as described above, and 100 μl of the fractions of interest were precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 60 μlof0.1 m Tris (pH 8.9), 1.1% (w/v) SDS before performing two-dimensional PAGE. Two-dimensional PAGE—25 μl of lipid raft fractions (fraction 3 or 4) were mixed with 300 μl of rehydration buffer containing thiourea (PlusOne Reagents) according to protocols provided by Amersham Biosciences. Isoelectric focusing was performed using Immobiline dry strips (18-cm strips; pH range from 4 to 7; Amersham Biosciences). The dry strips were rehydrated with the solubilized protein sample by in gel reswelling (12 h) and were electrophoresed at 20 °C for 8 h following conditions provided by the manufacturer. The second dimension was run in a 12.5% polyacrylamide SDS gel using a Bio-Rad XiII cell. Silver staining was performed using a kit from Amersham Biosciences. Gels were dried and exposed to Biomax MS film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Autoradiography and gels were scanned using a flat bed scanner (Amersham Biosciences). DNA-PK Complex Is Localized in Lipid Rafts—In an attempt to unravel the role that the DNA-PK may have in the signal transduction pathway in response to IR treatment, we investigated its localization in lipid rafts or DIGs. While technical variations are employed to isolate DIGs, one set of conditions, based on the solubilization of membranes in 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C followed by flotation in sucrose or Optiprep gradients, has become the benchmark protocol within the field. As shown in Fig. 1 (A–C), we localized components of the DNA-PK complex (Ku70, Ku86, and DNA-PKcs) in detergent-insoluble fractions, DIGs. To demonstrate that this was not a general phenomenon of members of the NHEJ machinery, a control was included for another member of this DNA repair pathway, XRCC4. As shown in Fig. 1D, the XRCC4 signal was only present in the soluble fractions. This result strongly suggests that the localization of the DNA-PK complex serves additional roles besides its main function in DSBR. Other controls included membrane hybridization with Ab against proteins reported to be present in lipid rafts like Lyn and caveolin-1, a membrane protein Na+/K+ ATPase, which is excluded from DIGs and tubulin as a representative soluble counterpart (see Fig. 1, A and E). We have extended these studies to other gene products, which belong to other DNA repair pathways besides NHEJ. Among those, the mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MSH6, which have been localized in soluble fractions (data not shown) (45Grazide S. Maestre N. Veldman R.J. Bezombes C. Maddens S. Levade T. Laurent G. Jaffrezou J.P. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the helicase BLM-1, which has been identified as the mutated target responsible for Bloom's syndrome in humans, is restricted to soluble fractions as well (data not shown). Collectively, these results show that the localization of DNA-PK complex is not a ubiquitous event of DNA repair components. The choice of detergent solubilization conditions is critical to the identification of DIG components. Retention of prominin in microvilli has been recently reported by using another nonionic detergent, Lubrol WX, at 4 °C, revealing a distinct cholesterol-based lipid microdomain (46Roper K. Corbeil D. Huttner W.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 582-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). When experiments were repeated using Lubrol WX as the solubilizing detergent, results were indistinguishable from the ones achieved by using Triton X-100 (data not shown). To fulfill one of the criteria of the operational definition of DIGs, detergent extraction was performed instead at 37 °C, and the gradient was run at room temperature. Results in Fig. 2 show, as expected, a shift to soluble fractions consistent with the identification of a protein as a component of lipid rafts. In addition, if cholesterol is extracted by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCBD), raft domains are perturbed, and raft proteins usually, but not always, become detergent-soluble. Because MCBD is very toxic to the cells, treatment conditions are restricted to low concentration of this chemical to maintain cell viability. However, lipid rafts are first assembled in the Golgi, and movement out of the Golgi seems to be mainly toward the plasma membrane. Thus, mild conditions for in vivo treatment might be insufficient to compete with the intracellular source of rafts contributed by Golgi vesicles. To circumvent this problem, we fractionated cells and isolated microsome fractions and treated them with a higher concentration of MCBD than the one normally used for in vivo studies. As shown in Fig. 3 (A–C), MCBD treatment under these conditions shifted the pattern of all of the subunits of DNA-PK toward the soluble fraction of the gradient. Finally, the localization of DNA-PK components in lipid rafts was confirmed in at least three independent preparations of the human cell line MO57 K and J and extended to other human cells (lymphocytes and tonsil), mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Independent Localization of DNA-PK Subunit into Lipid Rafts—DNA-PK is a heterotrimeric protein complex composed of Ku70, Ku86, and DNA-PKcs, which are assembled at DSBs. It has been previously shown that DNA-PKcs and Ku do not associate in the absence of DNA ends (47Yaneva M. Kowalewski T. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5098-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 48West R.B. Yaneva M. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5908-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar); however, a recent report has challenged this notion (49Ruiz M.T. Nichols A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2485-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In an attempt to understand the mechanism by which the DNA-PK complex is localized in lipid rafts, we prepared DIGs from human cells defective in DNA-PKcs, MO57J, and from controls MO57K (50Lees-Miller S.P. Godbout R. Chan D.W. Weinfeld M. Day III, R.S. Barron G.M. Allalunis-Turner J. Science. 1995; 267: 1183-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), from CHO cell line xrs-6, which we characterized previously as carrying a mutation in the Ku86 gene (51Singleton B.K. Priestley A. Steingrimsdottir H. Gell D. Blunt T. Jackson S.P. Lehmann A.R. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1264-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 52Mizuta R. Taccioli G.E. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and from its parental cell line CHO-K1. We and others demonstrated that the absence of Ku86 impairs the recruitment of DNA-PKcs to DNA ends. Thus, xrs-6 cells lack kinase activity, which in turn renders the cell line radiosensitive and defective in V(D)J recombination. In addition, the absence of Ku86 affects the stability of Ku70, and reduced levels of Ku70 are seen in xrs-6 when compared with parental control CHO-K1 (53Singleton B.K. Torres-Arzayus M.I. Rottinghaus S.T. Taccioli G.E. Jeggo P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3267-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the absence of DNA-PKcs does not affect localization of Ku70 (A and B) or Ku86 (not shown) into lipid rafts. Similarly, mutation in Ku86 does not impact on the localization of DNA-PKcs into lipid rafts (D–E). It is worth noting that the level of the DNA-PK complex in rodents is nearly 20-fold less than in humans, explaining the reduced signal in Fig. 4, D–E, even after concentration of the sample. These results show that the DNA-PK complex needs not be preassembled to be localized into DIGs and suggest an independent interaction of the subunits directly or indirectly with the plasma membrane proteins. Finally, one of the most important properties of lipid rafts is that they can include or exclude proteins to a variable extent in response to a stimulus. This regulatory aspect of DIGs was initially reported in studies on IgE receptors (for a review, see Ref. 43Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref Scopus (5164) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the response to low dose irradiation promotes relocation of any DNA-PK component into DIGs, we prepared lipid rafts from cells treated with IR and nonirradiated controls and compare the protein distribution pattern in representative fractions of the gradient. As shown in Fig. 4 (A–C), relocation of any of the subunits of the DNA-PK was not identified after 2 h of recovery postirradiation (5 grays). DNA-PK Components Are Mainly Membrane-associated Proteins—None of the subunits of the DNA-PK complex contain a trans-membrane domain that might explain their anchoring in the plasma membrane. To test the relative strength of association between DNA-PK protein subunits and cell membranes, we extracted the microsome fraction with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5, and with a strong chaotropic salt, KBr (2 m). Supernatants and extracted membrane pellets were analyzed for the presence of component proteins. We organized the resulting immunoblots from least extractable to most tightly bound (left to right in pellets and right to left in supern"
https://openalex.org/W2129595885,"The cytosolic Group IVA phospholipase A2 (GIVAPLA2) translocates to intracellular membranes to catalyze the release of lysophospholipids and arachidonic acid. GIVAPLA2 translocation and subsequent activity is regulated by its Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding C2 domain. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) also binds with high affinity and specificity to GIVAPLA2, facilitating membrane binding and activity. Herein, we demonstrate that GIVAPLA2 possessed full activity in the absence of Ca2+ when PI-4,5-P2 or phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were present. A point mutant, D43N, that is unable to bind Ca2+ also had full activity in the presence of PI-4,5-P2. However, when GIVAPLA2 was expressed without its Ca2+-binding C2 domain (DeltaC2), there was no interfacial activity. GIVAPLA2 and DeltaC2 both had activity on monomeric lysophospholipids. DeltaC2, but not the C2 domain alone, binds to phosphoinositides (PIPns) in the same manner as the full-length GIVAPLA2, confirming the location of the PIPn binding site as the GIVAPLA2 catalytic domain. Moreover, proposed PIPn-binding residues in the catalytic domain (Lys488, Lys541, Lys543, and Lys544) were confirmed to be essential for PI-4,5-P2-dependent activity increases. Exploiting the effects of PI-4,5-P2, we have discovered that the C2 domain plays a critical role in the interfacial activity of GIVAPLA2 above and beyond its Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding."

The catabolic versatility exhibited by microorganism plays an essential role in the carbon cycle, and this depends to a large extent on the use of oxygenases. In the degradation of aromatic compounds, oxygenases play a significant role both by hydroxylating the aromatic ring and by catalyzing the ring fission reaction. Nearly all bacterial pathways for the degradation of aromatic compounds transform initial substrates into intermediates that carry two or more hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring, which are then substrates for the ring cleavage dioxygenases. Cleavage is generally catalyzed by metalloenzymes of one of the two functional classes: intradiol dioxygenases, which cleave ortho to the hydroxyl substituents, or extradiol dioxygenases, which cleave meta to the hydroxyl substituents.Harayama and Rekik (1Harayama S. Rekik M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15328-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that extradiol dioxygenases could be divided into two families, those exhibiting a preference for bicyclic substrates and those with a preference for monocyclic substrates. Since then, several extradiol dioxygenases have been sequenced and characterized, and the evolutionary relationship among them has been investigated. The three-dimensional structures of three Type I extradiol dioxygenases, two of which cleave bicyclic compounds (2Han S. Eltis L.D. Timmis K.T.N. Muchmore S.W. Bolin J.T.

Structure. 1999; 7: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), have been reported. Whereas a majority of the bacterial extradiol dioxygenases that have been characterized contain Fe(II) as a catalytic metal center, there are only three known bacterial 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate 2,3-dioxygenase that utilize metals other than Fe(II); the enzyme from Bacillus brevis (5Que Jr., L. Widom J. Crawford R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 10941-10944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Arthrobacter globiformis CM-2 (6Boldt Y.R. Sadowsky M.J. Ellis L.B.M. Que Jr., L. Wackett L.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1225-1232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are manganese-dependent, whereas that from Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibits magnesium dependence (7Gibello A. Ferrer E. Martin M. Garrido-Pertierra A. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The degradation of biphenyl by bacteria has been well characterized at the genetic and biochemical level (8Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Masai E. Yamada A. Healy J.M. Hatta T. Fukuda M. Yano K. Appl. Environ.

The major pathway for biphenyl degradation is a four-step process initiated by the insertion of two atoms of oxygen at carbon positions 2 and 3 of the aromatic ring by biphenyl dioxygenase, the product of bphA genes. The resulting 2,3-dihydrodiol is dehydrogenated by a dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, the product of the bphB gene, to 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. This is cleaved at the meta position by the extradiol dioxygenase, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase (BphC), the product of the bphC gene (Fig. 1). Then a hydrolase encoded by the bphD gene hydrolyzes the 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoic acid into benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate.This pathway has been well studied for its potential to cometabolize polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), 1The abbreviations used are: PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl(s); X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mT, millitesla.1The abbreviations used are: PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl(s); X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; ICP-MS, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; mT, millitesla. a family of recalcitrant, toxic environmental pollutants. Considerable differences have been found in congener selectivity pattern and range of activity among various PCB-degrading bacteria (11Bedard D.L. Haberl M.H. Microb. Ecol. 1990; 20: 87-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12Gibson D.T. Cruden D.L. Haddock J.D. Zylstra G.J. Brand J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4561-4564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is the initial oxygenase (BphA) that is crucially responsible for recognition and binding of the substrate (13Erickson B.D. Mondello F.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1993; 59: 3858-3862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of the bph pathway is also limited in parts by the BphC enzyme, which is incapable of transforming certain chlorinated dihydroxy biphenyls (14Furukawa K. Tomizuka N. Kamibayashi A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1979; 38: 301-310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Seeger M. Timmis K.N. Hofer B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2654-2655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is inhibited by 3-chlorocatechol (16Sondossi M. Sylvestre M. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1992; 58: 485-495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Arensdorf J.J. Focht D.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 2884-2889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Astuiras J.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extradiol dioxygenases are also susceptible to mechanism-based inactivation by their aromatic substrates. Therefore, the potential of this pathway for the remediation of PCB-contaminated soils may not be fully realized until more stable forms of the enzymes are available. Thermophilic bacteria produce enzyme variants with vastly improved stability. To be able to rationally engineer such properties into mesophilic enzymes, a study of the determinants of the stability is an important task for basic and applied research. Although thermophiles degrading aromatic compounds such as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene isomers) and phenol/cresol have been isolated (19Chen C. Taylor R. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1995; 48: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Gurugeyalakshmi G. Oriel P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 500-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Mutzel A. Reinscheid U.M. Antranikian G. Muller R. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1996; 46: 593-596Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), the aromatic pathways in these organisms are not well studied, and there have been few reports on the characterization of the genes/proteins involved (22Dong F.-M.

Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).We have recently isolated a thermophilic bacterium Bacillus sp. JF8, which besides utilizing biphenyl and naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy, can transform several PCB congeners (24Shimura M. Mukerjee-Dhar G. Kimbara K. Nagato H. Kiyohara H. Hatta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 87-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From our analysis of the chlorobenzoic acids produced during mineralization of selected PCB congeners by strain JF8, we had concluded that the less chlorinated ring was oxidized, indicating similarity to the mesophilic PCB-degrading pathway. Probably, the upper biphenyl/PCB metabolic pathway in the thermophilic strain JF8 is identical to the metabolic pathway in mesophilic biphenyl/PCB degraders. Strain JF8N, a spontaneous mutant that lost the ability to utilize biphenyl as a carbon source while retaining the ability to utilize naphthalene, had indicated the presence of multiple dioxygenases in Bacillus sp. JF8. Here we report on the cloning and characterization of the extradiol dioxygenase, involved in the meta-cleavage of the biphenyl ring. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a Mn(II)-dependent, thermostable 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Media, and Cloning of bphCBacillus sp. strain JF8 was grown on Castenholz D medium (24Shimura M. Mukerjee-Dhar G. Kimbara K. Nagato H. Kiyohara H. Hatta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 87-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Biphenyl was added at a concentration of 2 g/liter. For solid medium (1.5% agar), biphenyl was provided as vapor. Escherichia coli MV1190 was used as a host strain for DNA manipulation. Luria broth (pH 7.5) containing 10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl was used as a complex medium. Ampicillin was added to the medium at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (X-gal) were used at concentrations of 100 and 40 μg/ml, respectively. Bacillus sp. JF8 was incubated at 60 °C, whereas Escherichia coli was incubated at 37 °C.DNA ManipulationTotal DNA of strain JF8 was isolated by a modification of the procedure described by Marmur (25Johnson J.L. Gerhardt P. Murray R.G.E. Wood W.A. Kreig N.R. Similarity Analysis of DNAs. Methods for General and Molecular Bacteriology, American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994Google Scholar), and plasmid DNA was isolated by the alkaline lysis method (26Birnboim H. Doly J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9847) Google Scholar). The total DNA of JF8 was digested by different restriction enzymes and DNA manipulations carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The recovered DNA fragments were ligated into appropriate vectors and transformed into E. coli cells by the CaCl2 procedure (28Mukerjee-Dhar G. Hatta T. Shimura M. Kimbara K. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on solid Luria broth plates supplemented with ampicillin, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and X-gal by spraying with 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl solution. Southern hybridization was performed under stringent conditions using Hybond N+ nylon membrane filter (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequencing was carried out by the dideoxy chain termination method of Sanger et al. (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52363) Google Scholar). The bphC gene of Rhodococcus sp. RHA1 (9Masai E. Yamada A. Healy J.M. Hatta T. Fukuda M. Yano K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1995; 61: 2079-2085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced into the multicopy tac promoter vector, pTTQ18 (Amersham Biosciences), to give pTT122X. The MPC_mt2 expression plasmid, pIX121, was similarly constructed by inserting the xylE gene (4Kita K. Kita S. Fujisawa I. Inaka K. Ishida T. Horiike K. Nozaki M. Miki K. Structure. 1999; 7: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) encoded by the TOL plasmid pWWO into pTTQ18.Purification and Characterization of the Native and Recombinant BphC ProteinThe plasmid pQW1, constructed by inserting the bphC gene from strain JF8 into pTTQ18, was introduced into E. coli MV1190. Cells were grown in 1.5 liters of Luria broth containing 250 μg/ml of ampicillin to an A600 = 0.4. The bphC gene was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 4 h of induction, cells were collected by centrifuging at 4000 × g for 10 min. For the native BphC protein, cells of strain JF8 were grown overnight on Castenholz D medium or on Luria broth with biphenyl. The cells were washed twice with 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and resuspended in the same buffer. The cells were disrupted by a French pressure cell (Aminco Corp.) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min and then at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was used as a cell-free extract for assaying 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase activity, which was determined by measuring the formation of the meta-cleavage reaction product at 434 nm with a Beckman DU7500 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermocontrolled cuvette holder, and the pH of the Tris-buffer was set at the assay temperature. Enzymatic activity was assayed at 60 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 330 μm 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that converts 1 μmol of substrate/min. The molar extinction coefficient of the product under assay conditions was taken to be 13,200 cm–1m–1. The relative meta-cleavage activities were determined from the extinction coefficients of the ring fission products formed from the following substrates: catechol (λmax, 375 nm; e, 33,000 cm–1m–1), 3-methylcatechol (λmax, 388 nm; e, 32,000 cm–1m–1), 4-methylcatechol (λmax, 382 nm; e, 17,000 cm–1m–1), and 4-chlorocatechol (λmax, 379 nm; e, 40,000 cm–1m–1). For purification of the enzyme, all manipulations were carried out at 10 °C in 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (Buffer A) unless otherwise mentioned.DEAE-Toyopearl Chromatography—The crude extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Toyopearl column (5.0 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with Buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl from 0 to 0.25 m in a total volume of 2500 ml of Buffer A. Active fractions, eluted around 0.2 m KCl, were collected.Phenyl-Sepharose Column Chromatography—The collected fractions were dialyzed against Buffer A containing 1.2 m ammonium sulfate. The resulting protein solution was loaded onto phenyl-Sepharose HP 2.6/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A containing 1.2 m ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted with an 800-ml gradient of 1.2 to 0.0 m ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was eluted around 0.1 m ammonium sulfate.MonoQ Column Chromatography—The active fractions eluted from phenyl-Sepharose column were pooled and dialyzed against Buffer A. The resulting solution was applied to a MonoQ HR 16/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A. After the column was washed with 60 ml of Buffer A, the enzyme was eluted with 400 ml of a linear gradient from 0.0 to 0.5 m KCl. The enzyme was eluted around 0.3 m KCl.Protein concentration was estimated by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Ann. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref Scopus (213510) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity and size of the enzyme proteins were estimated by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar). Protein staining of the gel was performed with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250.Determination of Molecular MassThe relative molecular mass of the native and recombinant enzyme was estimated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and chymotrypsin (25 kDa). The relative subunit molecular mass was determined by SDS-PAGE. The Amersham Biosciences low molecular mass calibration kit was used.N-terminal Sequence AnalysisPurified recombinant and native BphC_JF8 were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing by the Edman degradation process using a model 477A protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems) in accordance with the manufacturer's procedure.Kinetic MeasurementsMichaelis-Menten kinetics of the reaction was verified by plotting reaction rates against substrate concentration. The Km and Vmax values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the plots and graphically from Lineweaver-Burk plotting of the initial cleavage rate. The substrate concentrations were in the range 0.05–0.25 μm 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl at 60 °C and 0.1–0.5 μm at 25 °C. An activity assay of the enzyme was performed as mentioned above. For temperature stability and pH optimum, a temperature range of 30–90 °C and pH range of 6.0–9.0 (Tris-HCl and potassium phosphate buffer) was utilized, and the residual activities of the native and recombinant enzyme were determined. The buffer pH values were adjusted at the experimental temperature. The influence of metal cations, chelators, and inhibitors on enzyme activity was tested by incubating with samples of the purified enzyme (0.1 mg/ml) dialyzed against Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) for different time intervals at 25 °C. The activation energy (Ea) was estimated using the Arrhenius equation for the temperature range of 30–75 °C. The value of Ea was determined from the slope of the straight line that resulted when the logarithm of the reaction constant, k, was plotted against 1/T.Determination of Metal ContentMetal content was determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using a SEIKO SPQ6500 spectrometer (Seiko Instruments Inc.). Samples for ICP-MS were prepared using acid-washed glassware. Samples and standards were prepared in 0.1% HNO3. Separate standard curves were routinely prepared for iron and manganese, and samples were measured in quadruplicates.EPR Sample Preparation and Spectroscopic MethodSamples of 0.3 ml were inserted in 4.0-mm inner diameter quartz tubes and frozen by slow immersion in liquid nitrogen. X-band EPR spectra were measured and analyzed using JEOL JES-CT470 (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a JEOL JES-G470 liquid helium variable temperature system. The EPR spectrometer setting was as follows: microwave power, 1 milliwatt; modulation amplitude, 1 mT at 100 kHz. Spectra were obtained with a microwave frequency of 8.93 GHz at 10 K as a single 4-min scan from 50 to 550 mT.Phylogenetic AnalysisA homology search was performed with BLAST 2.0 (gapped BLAST) (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59182) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences retrieved from the protein databases were aligned using ClustalW version 1.9 (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

A phylogenetic tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using the Blosum62 distance matrix.Molecular ModelingSecondary structure predictions were done by building a consensus from the predicted results of PSIPRED (34Jones D.T.

The BphC_JF8 protein was modeled in the tetrameric state using the crystal structure of catechol 2,3-dioxygenase (MPC; Protein Data Bank code 1MPY) as the template (4Kita K. Kita S. Fujisawa I. Inaka K. Ishida T. Horiike K. Nozaki M. Miki K. Structure. 1999; 7: 25-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A preliminary model of the BphC_JF8 was constructed using automated modeling servers SWISS-MODEL (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9474) Google Scholar) and FAMS (39Ogata K. Umeyama H. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The final model was derived with the program package MODELLER version 6.0 (40Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10391) Google Scholar) and optimized by “refine1” molecular dynamic simulation as implemented in the same package. The stereochemical quality of the final model was assessed by the program PROCHECK version 3.0 (41Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystals. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of salt bridges was inferred when Asp or Glu side chain carbonyl oxygen atoms were found to be within a 4.0-Å distance from the nitrogen atoms in Arg and Lys side chains.RESULTSSequence Analysis of the Cloned meta-Cleavage Gene—A 4-kb HindIII fragment was isolated from the transformant (pBHC1), which could convert 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl into the yellow meta-cleavage product. Restriction analysis and sub-cloning resulted in the identification of a 1.5-kb HindIII-SacI fragment (pBH1) that encoded the extradiol dioxygenase activity. Sequencing the 1.5-kb fragment revealed a 945-bp open reading frame with a G + C content of 48%. The C-terminal region of an open reading frame upstream of the meta-cleavage gene exhibited homology to known dihydrodiol dehydrogenase genes (bphB), implying that the meta-cleavage gene is not isolated but is most probably part of an operon. The 16 S rDNA sequence (97.8% identity to Bacillus stearothermophilus) and various chemotaxonomic markers indicate that strain JF8 is related to B. stearothermophilus (24Shimura M. Mukerjee-Dhar G. Kimbara K. Nagato H. Kiyohara H. Hatta T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 87-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the codon usage of the bphC gene was compared with that of B. stearothermophilus and was found to be similar with one exception. The codon CCC, which is very rarely used in B. stearothermophilus, was found to be most frequently used to code for proline in BphC_JF8.Purification of the Biphenyl-induced Extradiol Dioxygenase and Its N-terminal Sequencing—Initially, the inducible extradiol dioxygenase from biphenyl-grown cells of Bacillus sp. JF8 was purified. The purification scheme for the native enzyme is given in Table I, and the enzyme was purified 32-fold with an overall yield of 54%. The SDS-PAGE of the purified enzyme showed one distinct band (Fig. 2). The N-terminal sequence of the native enzyme was determined by Edman degradation to be TAEIAKFGHIALITPNLEKSVWFFRdIVGLEEVdRQGdTI. This agrees with the DNA sequence data, except for the initial Met, of the cloned open reading frame, identifying the extradiol dioxygenase gene as a bphC. The bphC gene of JF8 was expressed from pQW1 in E. coli, and a three-step protocol (similar to one shown in Table I) was used to purify the recombinant extradiol dioxygenase, giving a 19-fold purification with a total recovery of 46%. The determined N-terminal sequence of the recombinant enzyme was identical to that of the native enzyme.Table IPurification of the native 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase of strain JF8Purification stepVolumeTotal proteinTotal activityaOne unit is defined as the amount of protein that converts 1 μmol of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl/min.Specific activityYieldmlmgunitsunits/mg%Crude extract15016802840.169100DEAE-Toyopearl 650M2821872411.2985Phenyl-Sepharose80321705.3160Mono Q40281535.4754a One unit is defined as the amount of protein that converts 1 μmol of 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl/min.

Activation in the presence of 1 mm Mn(II) at 25 and 60 °C is shown in Fig. 3. Activation at 60 °C was faster and resulted in a higher specific activity as compared with 25 °C. When the enzyme was incubated with 1 mm Fe(II) and ascorbate in argon gas, the enzyme was activated 20-fold. However, the activity diminished rapidly and came down to the original level in 20 s (results not shown).Fig. 3Activation of purified, recombinant BphC_JF8.

The iron content was found to be consistently low at 0.05 iron atoms/enzyme molecule. The oxidation state of the manganese in BphC_JF8 was determined using EPR spectroscopy (Fig. 4A). The typical 6-fold signal centered at g = 2.02 clearly showed the presence of Mn(II). The hyperfine coupling constant, A, of 9.3 mT compares well with that observed for other Mn(II)-dependent enzymes (42Whiting A.K. Boldt Y.R. Hendrich M.P. Wackett L.P. Que Jr., L.

Recently, we reported on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK) 1 and a transcriptional factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), as novel signaling intermediates in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. The aim of the study presented here was to clarify the role of Rac1 in the ASK1-NF-κB signaling pathway. Infection of isolated neonatal cardiac myocytes with an adenovirus expressing a constitutively active form of Rac1 (RacV12) enhanced the expression of a κB-dependent reporter gene construct and induced the degradation of IκBα. Expression of a degradation-resistant mutant of IκBα inhibited the RacV12-induced hypertrophic responses, including increases in protein synthesis and atrial natriuretic factor production and the enhancement of sarcomeric organization. An immune complex kinase assay indicated that the expression of RacV12 activated ASK1. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of ASK1 eliminated the RacV12-induced NF-κB activation and the biochemical and morphological hypertrophic responses, whereas expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 attenuated phenylephrine-induced activation of ASK1 and NF-κB and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.

These findings suggest that Rac1 induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy mediated through ASK1 and NF-κB. Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy is an important adaptive process in response to various extracellular stimuli such as mechanical stress, cytokines, and growth factors. The hypertrophic response is compensatory in nature, but sustained excessive workloads may lead to heart failure. Epidemiological studies suggest that cardiac hypertrophy is an independent risk factor for cardiac morbidity and results in a significant increase in the relative risk of mortality from cardiovascular diseases (1Levy D. Garrison R.J. Savage D.D. Kannel W.B. Castelli W.P. N. Eng. J. Med. 1990; 323: 1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (4784) Google Scholar). Analysis of the signal transduction cascade in the development of cardiac hypertrophy has used neonatal ventricular myocytes as a model system. The hypertrophic response is characterized by an increase in cell volume, the assembly of contractile proteins into reorganized sarcomeric units, and the reactivation of fetal genes such as the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) 1The abbreviation used are: ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; MEKK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase; MKK6, MAP kinase kinase 6; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; ASK(KM) dominant negative form of ASK1 with mutant K709M; AdASK(KM), adenoviral vector expressing ASK(KM); ASKΔN, constitutively active form of ASK1; AdIκBα32/36A, adenoviral vector expressing a mutated form of human IκBα (S32A/S36A); RacV12, constitutively active mutant of Rac1; AdRacV12, adenoviral vector expressing AdRacV12; RacN17, dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (S17N); AdRacN17, adenoviral vector expressing RabB17; AdLacZ, adenoviral vector expressing bacterial β-galactosidase; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; PAK, p21-activated kinase. 1The abbreviation used are: ANF, atrial natriuretic factor; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; MEKK, MAP kinase/ERK kinase kinase; MKK6, MAP kinase kinase 6; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; ASK(KM) dominant negative form of ASK1 with mutant K709M; AdASK(KM), adenoviral vector expressing ASK(KM); ASKΔN, constitutively active form of ASK1; AdIκBα32/36A, adenoviral vector expressing a mutated form of human IκBα (S32A/S36A); RacV12, constitutively active mutant of Rac1; AdRacV12, adenoviral vector expressing AdRacV12; RacN17, dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (S17N); AdRacN17, adenoviral vector expressing RabB17; AdLacZ, adenoviral vector expressing bacterial β-galactosidase; GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HA, hemagglutinin; NAC, N-acetyl cysteine; PAK, p21-activated kinase. (2Chien K.R. Grace A.A. Hunter J.J. Chien K.R. Molecular Basis of Cardiovascular Disease. W. B. Saunders Co., Cambridge, MA1999: 211-250Google Scholar). The signaling pathways, in which extracellular signals are transmitted into myocytes to induce the hypertrophic responses, are probably multifold, but the small (21-kDa) guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-protein) of the Ras and Rho families have been implicated in the regulation of this process (3Clerk A. Sugden P.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1019-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Rho family GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, participate in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and various cell adhesion events (4Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Rac is involved in membrane ruffling, cell motility, actin polymerization, and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in non-muscle cells. In addition to its roles in cell morphology, Rac participates in regulating transcription both through the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (5Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 6Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac has been reported to activate the transcription factor, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (7Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by Rac might be a trigger for NF-κB activation (7Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the activated form of Rac1 can also stimulate cell cycle progression to promote DNA synthesis in fibroblasts (8Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, Rac has been implicated in their hypertrophic response, mediating both the morphological and transcriptional changes. Previous studies have demonstrated that the hypertrophic agonists such as endothelin-1 and phenylephrine induce rapid activation of Rac1 in cardiac myocytes (9Clerk A. Pham F.H. Fuller S.J. Sahai E. Aktories K. Marais R. Marshall C. Sugden P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Transfection of cardiac myocytes with a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 (RacV12) was found to increase ANF, brain natriuretic factor (BNP), and α-skeletal actin promoter activities (10Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and the adenoviral gene transfer of RacV12 resulted in the enhancement of sarcomeric organization and increases in cell size and protein synthesis, along with increased ANF expression. Furthermore, infection with an adenovirus expressing a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (RacN17) inhibited the phenylephrine-induced hypertrophic responses (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of Rac1 in mouse heart resulted in the induction of a cardiomyopathic phenotype characterized by hypertrophy or dilation (12Sussman M.A. Welch S. Walker A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The downstream effectors of Rac, however, have not yet been thoroughly characterized. Recently, we identified apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and NF-κB as novel signaling intermediates involved in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (13Higuchi Y. Otsu K. Nishida K. Hirotani S.

ASK1 was recently identified as an ROS-sensitive MAP kinase kinase kinase that activates JNK and p38 (15Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar), and the JNK/p38 pathways are known to play important roles in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (16Ramirez M.T.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3518-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists and tumor necrosis factor-α activate NF-κB in rat neonatal cardiac myocytes (13Higuchi Y. Otsu K. Nishida K. Hirotani S. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 233-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K.

Inhibition of NF-κB activation resulted in elimination of the agonist-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, suggesting that NF-κB is required for the hypertrophic growth of cardiac myocytes. Moreover, GPCR agonists activate ASK1, and overexpression of a dominant negative form of ASK1, ASK(KM), inhibits GPCR agonist-induced myocyte hypertrophy. The constitutively active form of ASK1 (ASK(ΔN)) activates NF-κB, leading to hypertrophy. We therefore hypothesized that ASK1 and NF-κB might be present downstream of Rac1 in the signal transduction pathway during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. In this study, we demonstrated that Rac1 induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via the activation of NF-κB and that ASK1 is required for the activation of NF-κB and the development of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Primary Culture of Neonatal Rat Ventricular Myocytes—Rat ventricular myocytes from 1- or 2-day-old Wister rats were prepared and cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (19Kimura Y. Otsu K. Nishida K. Kuzuya T. Tada M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1994; 26: 1145-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The media were changed to serum-free DMEM supplemented with transferrin (5 μg/ml) and insulin (1 μg/ml) 24 h before adenoviral infection and/or treatments. Recombinant Adenovirus Vectors—The replication-defective E1 and E3 adenoviral vector expressing either a mutated form of human IκBα (AdIκBα32/36A; mutant Ser32 and Ser36 to Ala), a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (AdRacN17; mutant Ser17 to Asn), or bacterial β-galactosidase (AdLacZ) was described previously (13Higuchi Y. Otsu K. Nishida K. Hirotani S. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. J. Mol. Cell.

Adenoviral vectors expressing a dominant negative (AdASK(KM); mutant Lys709 to Met) and a constitutively active (AdASK-ΔN) form of ASK1 were also described in previous reports (21Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Adenovirus AdRacV12, containing the myc-tagged constitutively active Rac1 cDNA, was constructed by means of homologous recombination in human embryonic kidney 293 cells using the adenovirus-based plasmid JM17 (22McGrory W.J. Bautista D.S. Graham F.L. Virology. 1988; 163: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Cardiac myocytes were infected with the recombinant adenovirus vectors at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units per cell for 1 h. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM for an additional 24 h prior to treatment. To confirm successful infection with adenoviruses, myocytes infected with AdLacZ were costained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Myocytes infected with epitope-tagged adenoviruses were co-stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies followed by incubation with epitope-specific first antibodies (anti-HA for AdRacN17, AdASK(ΔN), and AdASK(KM) and anti-myc for AdRacV12) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Adenoviruses were successfully infected to more than 95% of all myocytes. Expression of the epitope-tagged RacN17 and RacV12 was assessed by Western blotting using 20 μg of myocardial protein lysates along with HA- and myc-specific antibodies, respectively. The probed proteins were detected with secondary antibodies by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of NF-κB Activity—Cardiac myocytes plated on 22-mm-diameter culture dishes were exposed to 5 μg of lipofectin with the luciferase reporter construct containing consensus NF-κB binding sites (1.67 μg) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) (23Nishida K. Otsu K. Hori M. Kuzuya T. Tada M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM, viral infection was initiated, and the myocytes were cultured for 24 h. Myocytes were assayed for luciferase activity using a luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega). The activity was normalized to total protein concentration and expressed as -fold stimulation relative to control. To assess the degradation of IκBα, cell lysates (20 μg) were subjected to Western blot analysis with the polyclonal antibody against IκBα as described previously (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). [3H]Leucine Incorporation—For the assessment of protein synthesis, [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) was added to each well 12 h after viral infection. Thereafter, the myocytes were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 4 °C, and lysed with 0.5 m NaOH. Six volumes of scintillation fluid were applied to the resultant lysates, and the mixtures were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Histochemical Assay—Forty-eight hours after viral infection, myocytes grown on gelatin-coated glass coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. ANF was detected with the aid of rabbit anti-rat ANF polyclonal antiserum (Phoenix Laboratories) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences). The F-actin was detected using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Immune Complex Kinase Assay of ASK1—The activity of ASK1 was measured by an immune complex kinase assay as described previously (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 15Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). Transient transfection of HA-tagged ASK1 in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) to cardiac myocytes was performed as described above. After incubation for 24 h in serum-free DMEM, viral infection was initiated, and cell lysates were prepared after 8 h of infection. Samples containing 200 μg of total proteins were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-HA antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. Kinase activity was determined by incubation with 1 μg of His-tagged MKK6 and 1 μCi [γ32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. The phosphorylation level of the substrates was analyzed by means of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and autoradiography. Furthermore, endogenous levels of ASK1 activation were estimated using the anti-ASK1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between experimental groups were analyzed for statistical significance with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's post-test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Activation of Rac1 Results in Stimulation of NF-κB Activity in Cardiac Myocytes—A previous study has shown that infection of cardiac myocytes with AdRacV12 induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We examined whether NF-κB is involved as a transcription factor in RacV12-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Isolated cardiac myocytes were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing consensus NF-κB binding sites. Infection of myocytes with AdRacV12 led to increased luciferase activity, whereas infection of a control adenoviral vector expressing bacterial β-galactosidase, AdLacZ, had no effect on NF-κB activation (Fig. 1A). To confirm the activation of NF-κB by Rac1, we examined the degradation of IκBα by using an anti-IκBα antibody for Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). IκBα was indeed degraded in cells infected with AdRacV12. These findings indicated that Rac1 activates NF-κB in cardiac myocytes. NF-κB Is Involved in Activated Rac1-induced Cardiac Myocyte Hypertrophy—We also examined the role of NF-κB in myocyte hypertrophy induced by RacV12. The effectiveness of an adenovirus expressing a degradation-resistant form of IκBα, (AdIκBα32/36A) in blocking activation of NF-κB was assessed in a reporter gene assay. The luciferase activation induced by overexpression of RacV12 was reduced to near control levels in the myocytes co-infected with AdIκBα32/36A (Fig. 1A). Next, we examined the effects of AdIκBα32/36A on cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by RacV12. At the cellular level, the hypertrophic response is characterized by an increase in protein synthesis, an induction of sarcomere organization, and an increase in the expression of embryonic genes such as ANF. As seen in Fig. 2A, infection with AdRacV12 increased [3H]leucine uptake into cardiac myocytes, but the increase was suppressed by co-infection with AdIκBα32/36A, whereas infection with AdIκBα32/36A alone had no effect on [3H]leucine uptake. We also analyzed the cytoskeletal organization in cardiac myocytes by phalloidin staining (Fig. 2B) and the expression of ANF by immunohistochemical staining using antibodies against the ANF protein (Fig. 2C). Both uninfected cells and cells infected with AdLacZ showed a reticular actin organization lacking sarcomeric formation, whereas infection with AdRacV12 significantly induced the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton into a sarcomeric structure as was also reported previously (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Sussman M.A. Welch S. Walker A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Co-infection with AdIκBα32/36A led to the elimination of the enhancement of the sarcomere organization, but infection with AdIκBα32/36A alone had no effect on cell morphology. The percentage of myocytes expressing the ANF protein was increased by infection with AdRacV12 compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with AdLacZ (Fig. 2D). Inhibition of the RacV12-induced NF-κB activation eliminated the increase in ANF expression. These findings suggested that the activation of NF-κB is involved in morphological and biochemical hypertrophic responses induced by Rac1. Activation of Rac1 Results in Stimulation of ASK1 Activity—We demonstrated previously that ASK1 was necessary for NF-κB activation and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy by GPCR agonists (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). This time, we examined whether the overexpression of RacV12 could activate ASK1 in cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocytes were transfected with HA-tagged ASK1. Eight hours after infection with AdRacV12, the extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody. An ASK1 kinase assay was then carried out using MKK6 as a substrate (Fig. 3A, top). As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression of RacV12 resulted in the activation of ASK1. To confirm the activation of ASK1 by RacV12, we estimated endogenous ASK1 activation. The immune complex kinase assay using the anti-ASK1 antibody indicated that RacV12 significantly activated endogenous ASK1 (Fig. 3A, bottom). Western blotting showed a significant amount of RacV12 protein in cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3B). ASK1 Is Required for RacV12-induced NF-κB Activation and Cardiac Myocyte Hypertrophy—To determine the involvement of ASK1 in the RacV12-induced NF-κB activation, we infected cardiac myocytes with an adenovirus expressing a dominant negative form of ASK1 (AdASK(KM)). Overexpression of ASK(KM) completely eliminated the activation of κB-dependent luciferase (Fig. 4A) and the degradation of IκBα induced by RacV12 (Fig. 4B). These findings suggested that ASK1 connects Rac1 with NF-κB. Next, we examined the involvement of ASK1 in RacV12-induced myocyte hypertrophy. Infection of myocytes with AdASK(KM) significantly suppressed the increase in [3H] leucine uptake (Fig. 5A), the enhancement of sarcomeric reorganization, and the expression of ANF (Fig. 5B) induced by RacV12. The percentage of cells expressing ANF was similar to the basal level (8.1 ± 2.4% for the co-infection with AdRacV12 + AdASK(KM)). We thus concluded that ASK1 is involved in the RacV12-induced NF-κB activation, which leads to the induction of morphological and biochemical hypertrophic responses. Inhibition of Rac1 Activity Results in Abrogation of ASK1 and NF-κB Activation by the Hypertrophic Agonist—Previous reports have demonstrated that expression of a dominant negative form of Rac1 (RacN17) inhibited GPCR agonist-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To determine the role of Rac1 in the GPCR agonist-induced ASK1-NF-κB signaling pathway, we studied the effect of RacN17 on the activations of ASK1 and NF-κB. Phenylephrine induced ASK1 activation in HA-ASK-transfected cardiac myocytes, as was also reported previously (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the activation was significantly attenuated in cardiac myocytes pre-infected with AdRacN17 (Fig. 6A, top). Similar results were obtained when we examined endogenous ASK1 activation using the anti-ASK1 antibody (Fig. 6A, bottom). We confirmed significant RacN17 expression as shown in Fig. 6B. As we also reported previously (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), both phenylephrine and a constitutively active form of ASK1, ASK(ΔN), significantly activated NF-κB (Fig. 7A). Infection with AdRacN17 eliminated the phenylephrine-induced NF-κB activation. In contrast, ASK(ΔN)-induced NF-κB activation was not inhibited by co-infection with AdRacN17. These results suggested that Rac1 mediates phenylephrine-induced NF-κB activation through ASK1 activation.Fig. 7The effect of RacN17 on ligand-induced or gene transfer-mediated myocyte hypertrophy. Cardiac myocytes were infected with AdLacZ or AdASK(ΔN) alone or coinfected with AdRacN17 and AdASK(ΔN). After 24 h of infection, myocytes were treated with or without phenylephrine. Values show the mean ± S.E. of data for three experiments performed in triplicate. A, NF-κB luciferase activation and Western blot with anti IκBα antibody. B, [3H]leucine incorporation. C, organization of sarcomere structure. D, ANF protein expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We previously reported that the infection of myocytes with AdASK(ΔN) induced myocyte hypertrophy (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Both phenylephrine and AdASK(ΔN) induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, which is characterized by increases in [3H]leucine uptake and ANF expression and the enhancement of sarcomeric organization. Infection with AdRacN17, on the other hand, inhibited the hypertrophic response to phenylephrine as was also previously reported (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7, B–D). However, ASK(ΔN)-induced increases in [3H]leucine uptake and ANF expression and the enhancement of sarcomeric organization were not affected by co-infection with AdRacN17 (Fig. 7, B–D). This suggested that ASK1 is present downstream of Rac1 during cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. N-acetyl Cysteine, an Antioxidant, Abolished the RacV12-induced ASK1 and NF-κB Activation Leading to Hypertrophic Responses—In HeLa cells, a previous report has demonstrated that Rac1 activates NF-κB via ROS generation (7Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the role of ROS in Rac1-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, cardiac myocytes were preincubated with an antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), for 1 h prior to AdRacV12 infection. Preincubation with NAC significantly suppressed the activation of NF-κB by RacV12 and also inhibited the increase in [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 8A), the enhancement of sarcomeric structure, and the expression of ANF (Fig. 8B). The percentages of ANF-positive cells were similar to control level (9.0 ± 1.6% for NAC+AdLacZ and 8.8 ± 1.0% for NAC+AdRacV12). Next, we investigated the effect of NAC on ASK1 activation by RacV12. The immune complex kinase assay revealed that RacV12-induced ASK1 activation was significantly abolished by preincubation with NAC (Fig. 8C). These findings suggested that ROS is involved in Rac1-induced ASK1 and NF-κB activation and myocyte hypertrophy Rac1 has been found to be involved in cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 12Sussman M.A. Welch S. Walker A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Expression of RacV12 in cardiac myocytes leads to the characteristic features of cardiac hypertrophy, including morphological changes, increased protein synthesis, and alteration of gene expression, which are indistinguishable from the characteristics of the GPCR agonist-stimulated hypertrophy. The results presented here suggest a role for Rac1 in the signal transduction pathway leading to cardiac hypertrophy mediated through ASK1 and NF-κB. In HeLa cells, a transient expression of RacV12 was found to induce the activation of NF-κB (7Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we demonstrated that infection of cardiac myocytes with AdRacV12 led to increases in κB-dependent luciferase activity as well as IκBα degradation. In addition, the expression of RacN17 inhibited phenylephrine-induced NF-κB activation. These findings indicate that Rac1 functions upstream of NF-κB activation in cardiac myocytes. In agreement with the previous report (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), RacV12 induced morphological and biochemical hypertrophic responses, whereas RacN17 inhibited phenylephrine-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by infection with AdIκBα32/36A resulted in the elimination of RacV12-induced cardiac hypertrophic responses, such as increases in protein synthesis and ANF expression and the enhancement of sarcomere organization. These results clearly indicate that Rac1 functions upstream of NF-κB activation for the development of cardiac hypertrophy. It has been reported that Rac participates in regulating transcription both through JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways (5Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1555) Google Scholar, 6Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). ASK1 was recently identified as a MAP kinase kinase kinase, which activates both JNK and p38 (15Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). We identified the involvement of ASK1 in GPCR agonist-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via the activation of NF-κB (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In the current study, we showed that overexpression of activated Rac1 induced ASK1 activation and that infection with AdRacN17 eliminated phenylephrine-induced ASK1 activation. Because wild-type MKK6 was used as substrate for ASK1 kinase assays rather than catalytically inactive MKK6, autophosphorylation of the recombinant protein might exaggerate the extent of ASK1 activation. However, the extent of ASK1 activation by Rac1 was significantly larger than that in control cells, suggesting ASK1 activation by Rac1. We further demonstrated that overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of ASK1 inhibited activated Rac1-induced NF-κB activation. These results indicate that Rac1 induces NF-κB activation mediated through ASK1, thus leading to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. Although the intermediate molecule, which mediates the hypertrophic signal from GPCR to ASK1, has not been identified yet, we strongly suggest Rac1 as the candidate molecule that mediates the hypertrophic signal from GPCR to the downstream target, ASK1. The probability of this signaling sequence was confirmed by the finding that ASK(ΔN)-induced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy was not affected by co-infection with AdRacN17. This is the first report to suggest that ASK may act as a Rac target. The ASK-NF-κB signaling pathway can mediate both morphological and biochemical changes induced by RacV12. To date, several potential targets of Rac have been identified, including p21-activated kinase (PAK), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase, and MAP kinase kinase kinases such as the mixed-lineage kinases MEKK1 and MEKK4 (6Mackay D.J. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20685-20688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 24Van-Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). PAK has been reported to be a likely candidate for controlling the activation of JNK and p38 by Rac (25Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23934-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, expression of active PAK can stimulate NF-κB activation (29Frost J.A. Swantek J.L. Stippec S. Yin M.J. Gaynor R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19693-19699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have demonstrated that PAK was translocated from a cytosolic to a cytoskeletal distribution in Rac1 transgenic mouse hearts, exhibiting cardiac hypertrophy (12Sussman M.A. Welch S. Walker A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Price R.L. Schaefer E. Yager K. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that PAK could be a potential target of Rac1 in cardiac hypertrophy. To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no reports indicating a positive role for PAK in cardiac hypertrophy. Although AdASK(KM) completely eliminated activated Rac1-induced cardiac hypertrophy, our results do not exclude a possible role for PAK down-stream of Rac1 in cardiac hypertrophy. It should be of interest to determine the possible interplay between the ASK1 and PAK pathways as a downstream target of Rac1 in regard to the development of myocyte hypertrophy. In addition, the Rac and the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathways appear to be closely connected in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, because RacN17 was found to inhibit Ras-mediated ERK2 activation (25Frost J.A. Xu S. Hutchison M.R. Marcus S. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Activated Rac synergizes with an active form of Raf to increase ERK activity. In cardiac myocytes, a previous transfection study has demonstrated that transient expression of RacV12 slightly increased ANF-luciferase (9Clerk A. Pham F.H. Fuller S.J. Sahai E. Aktories K. Marais R. Marshall C. Sugden P.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, the combination of RacV12 with ΔN-Raf (an activated form of Raf) synergistically stimulated a response in ANF-luciferase similar to that induced by endothelin-1, suggesting that activation of Rac1 by hypertrophic stimuli contributes to the modulation of the ERK cascade. Therefore, some of the effects of Rac1 on hypertrophy may be attributable to an input into the ERK cascade in addition to that into the ASK1 pathway. However, the expression of RacN17 at a level sufficient to disrupt the morphological response to phenylephrine had no effect on ERK activity, suggesting that the morphological effect of Rac1 is independent of ERK activation (11Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Hegland D.D. Kim K.S. Sethi R. Rovira I.I. Blazina D.R. Lee L. Bruder J.T. Kovesdi I. Goldshmidt-Clermont P.J. Irani K. Finkel T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 929-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Further studies will be necessary to clarify the role of ERK in Rac-mediated cardiac hypertrophy. It is currently unclear precisely how the Rac protein regulates ASK1 activation. Saitoh et al. (21Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar) have reported that ASK1 is present as an inactive complex with thioredoxin and that ROS oxidizes thioredoxin, thus dissociating from ASK1 and leading to the activation of ASK1. Sulciner et al. (7Sulciner D.J. Irani K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont P. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7115-7121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that Rac1 regulates intracellular ROS production and that Rac proteins function as part of a redox-dependent signal pathway leading to NF-κB activation in HeLa cells. In cardiac myocytes, Takemoto et al. (30Takemoto M. Node K. Nakagami H. Liao Y. Grimm M. Takemoto Y. Kitakaze M. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1429-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of RacN17 completely inhibited angiotensin II-induced intracellular oxidation, whereas others and we (13Higuchi Y.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar) have noted the important role of ROS in myocyte hypertrophy. GPCR agonist-induced ASK1 and NF-κB activations were found to be blocked by antioxidants (14Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NAC, an antioxidant, suppressed NF-κB and ASK1 activation and the hypertrophic response induced by RacV12. Taken together, these findings provide support to the concept of a sequential pathway linking Rac1, ROS production, and the activation of ASK1 and NF-κB. It is as yet unclear exactly how Rac proteins regulate the intracellular redox state in non-phagocytic cells. The NADPH oxidase system, whose activity may be regulated by Rac proteins, has been identified as a superoxide-generating system in phagocytic cells (32Knaus U.G. Heyworth P.G. Evans T. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1512-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 33Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Ando S. Musha T. Hiraoka K. Takaishi K. Asada M. Nunoi H. Matsuda I. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2578) Google Scholar). It can therefore be hypothesized that Rac proteins may act directly via protein-protein interaction to organize the ROS generating system, NADPH oxidase, in a manner similar to what occurs in neutrophils. These are in vitro studies and used experimental designs that require overexpression of the proteins involved. Our approach has a disadvantage in that it may influence the function/expression of other related proteins. Also, an in vitro study does not always mimic the phenomenon in vivo. Defining precise and physiological roles for Rac1 will require cardiac specific knockout mice. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a signal transduction pathway in which the small G protein Rac1 induces cardiac myocyte hypertrophy via the activation of NF-κB, and ASK1 mediates the Rac1-induced signal transduction pathway toward NF-κB activation. We thank Dr. Hidenori Ichijo of the University of Tokyo and Dr. Yoshimi Takai of Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine for the gift of adenoviral vectors expressing dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of ASK1 and the RacV12 cDNA and anti-myc antibody, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1986505831,"The dynamics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) production during periods of G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ oscillations have been investigated using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-PHPLCδ1). Activation of noradrenergic α1B and muscarinic M3 receptors recombinantly expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cell indicates that Ca2+ responses to these G-protein-coupled receptors are stimulus strength-dependent. Thus, activation of α1B receptors produced transient base-line Ca2+ oscillations, sinusoidal Ca2+ oscillations, and then a steady-state plateau level of Ca2+ as the level of agonist stimulation increased. Activation of M3 receptors, which have a higher coupling efficiency than α1B receptors, produced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ even at low levels of agonist stimulation. Confocal imaging of eGFP-PHPLCδ1 visualized periodic increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production underlying the base-line Ca2+ oscillations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations were blocked by thapsigargin but not by protein kinase C down-regulation. The net effect of increasing intracellular Ca2+ was stimulatory to Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, and dual imaging experiments indicated that receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was sensitive to changes in intracellular Ca2+ between basal and ∼200 nM. Together, these data suggest that α1B receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations result from a positive feedback effect of Ca2+ onto phospholipase C. The mechanisms underlying α1B receptor-mediated Ca2+ responses are therefore different from those for the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5a, where Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations are the primary driving force for oscillatory Ca2+ responses (Nash, M. S., Young, K. W., Challiss, R. A. J., and Nahorski, S. R. (2001) Nature 413, 381–382). For α1B receptors the Ca2+-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 production may serve to augment the existing regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process; however, the sensitivity to Ca2+ feedback is such that only transient base-line Ca2+ spikes may be capable of causing Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations. The dynamics of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) production during periods of G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated Ca2+ oscillations have been investigated using the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of phospholipase C (PLC) δ1 tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP-PHPLCδ1). Activation of noradrenergic α1B and muscarinic M3 receptors recombinantly expressed in the same Chinese hamster ovary cell indicates that Ca2+ responses to these G-protein-coupled receptors are stimulus strength-dependent. Thus, activation of α1B receptors produced transient base-line Ca2+ oscillations, sinusoidal Ca2+ oscillations, and then a steady-state plateau level of Ca2+ as the level of agonist stimulation increased. Activation of M3 receptors, which have a higher coupling efficiency than α1B receptors, produced a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ even at low levels of agonist stimulation. Confocal imaging of eGFP-PHPLCδ1 visualized periodic increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production underlying the base-line Ca2+ oscillations. Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations were blocked by thapsigargin but not by protein kinase C down-regulation.

Frequency encoding of Ca2+ signals in the form of oscillations provides a versatile mechanism by which a number of intracellular processes are controlled (1De Koninck P. Schulman H.

Physiol. 1995; 269: C1079-C1092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ oscillations driven by a steady state raised level of Ins(1,4,5)P3 may occur via a regenerative Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release process (CICR), which is an integral property of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor (InsP3R) (see Ref. 5Thomas A.P. Bird G.S. Hajnoczky G. Robb-Gaspers L.D. Putney J.W. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1505-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In contrast, the sensitivity of certain oscillatory Ca2+ responses to feedback inhibition by protein kinase C (PKC), or regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins, suggests that Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels may oscillate and hence drive Ca2+ oscillations (8Bird G.S.

These two categories need not be mutually exclusive as, for example, Ca2+ may be required to recruit PKC to the plasma membrane before feedback inhibition can occur (12Nash M.S. Schell M.J.

This method has indeed detected Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations in ATP-stimulated Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (14Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) and metabotropic glutamate receptor 5a (mGluR5a)–stimulated CHO cells (10Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R.

Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations mediated by mGluR5a activation arise from a PKC-dependent dynamic uncoupling of the receptor from its signaling pathway (9Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T.

In contrast, however, muscarinic M3 receptor-driven sinusoidal Ca2+ oscillations in CHO cells were associated with a modest steady-state increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 (10Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This current study has investigated the cellular dynamics of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and Ca2+ signaling in individual CHO cells in response to noradrenergic α1B and muscarinic M3 receptor stimulation, using the mGluR5a model for PKC-dependent dynamic receptor uncoupling as a comparison. Our results provide the first direct evidence that Ca2+ oscillations may stimulate transient increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 via a positive feedback effect on phospholipase C (PLC). Moreover, although PKC can regulate receptor activity, it appears not to be directly involved in the Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations initiated by α1B receptors. Furthermore, the Ca2+ sensitivity of PLC isoforms in CHO cells is such that only Ca2+ oscillations of the transient base-line spiking nature would be capable of stimulating this positive feedback. In comparison, in the same cells, mGluR5a-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations appear to contain elements of both positive Ca2+ feedback and dynamic PKC-mediated inhibition, dependent on the agonist concentration. The role of this Ca2+ feedback-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 production may be to enhance the regenerative CICR process by increasing the number of Ins(1,4,5)P3-bound InsP3Rs available for activation. Cell Culture and Plasmid Transfection—CHO cells stably expressing noradrenergic α1B (2.3 pmol/mg protein) and muscarinic M3 receptors (3.4 pmol/mg protein) (CHOα1B/M3) were maintained in minimum Eagle's medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone, 400 μg/ml G418, and 300 units/ml hygromycin. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5a expressing CHO cells (CHO-lac-mGlu5a) were created using the LacSwitch IIinducible expression system (Stratagene) as described previously (12Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Maximal levels of mGluR5a expression were achieved by preincubation with 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (12Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were plated to near confluence on coverslips before being transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA plus 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) per coverslip (according to manufacturer's instructions). Cells were used 48 h after transfection. For experiments examining mGluR5a transiently expressed in CHOα1B/M3 cells, 0.5 μg of mGluR5a in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was co-transfected with 0.5 μg of eGFP-PHPLCδ1 with 3 μl of FuGENE 6 per coverslip. The medium was changed after 24 h to prevent accumulation of extracellular glutamate, and cells were used after a further 24 h. The eGFP-PHPLCδ1 construct was a kind gift from Prof. Tobias Meyer. Single Cell Imaging of Ins(1,4,5)P3and Ca2+—Coverslips were mounted on the stage of an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope and perfused at 37 °C with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (in mm: NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 1.2, CaCl2 1.3, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 4.2, HEPES 10, glucose 11.7, pH 7.4). Images of cells after excitation at 488 nm were collected using an Olympus FV500 laser scanning confocal microscope at a scan rate of 1.5–2.5 Hz. Increases in cellular Ins(1,4,5)P3 were detected by measuring the translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ1 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol. This was done by creating a cytosolic region of interest and plotting the average pixel intensity in that region versus time. Data are expressed in relative fluorescent units (RFU) by subtraction of background fluorescence followed by dividing the fluorescent intensity at a given time by the initial fluorescence within each region of interest (F/F0). Experiments involving co-detection of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+ were made by transfecting CHOα1B/M3 cells with eGFP-PHPLCδ1 as above and then loading the cells with fura-2 (2 μm fura-2AM, 1 h). The cells were then excited at 340 and 380 nm (for fura-2) and 488 nm (for eGFP) using a Spectramaster II monochromator (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Images were collected via a cooled CCD camera using the Merlin2000 data acquisition system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at a sample rate of 0.7 Hz. Changes in cytosolic eGFP-PHPLCδ1 were measured as described above. Simultaneously, changes in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) were measured by converting the 340/380 ratio of fluorescence (after background subtraction) to approximate [Ca2+]i using the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The minimal and maximal fluorescence ratios (Rmin and Rmax) were obtained from a sample set of CHO cells using 5 μm ionomycin and 6 mm EGTA (for Rmin) followed by 10 mm CaCl2 (for Rmax). Receptor-dependent Ca2+Oscillations in CHO Cells—The temporal patterns of intracellular Ca2+ signals in CHO cells co-expressing noradrenergic α1B and muscarinic M3 receptors were compared with those elicited by the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5a. The α1B receptor was capable of stimulating Ca2+ oscillations over a range of agonist concentrations. Thus, increasing the concentration of noradrenaline (NA) from 10-8 to 3 × 10-7m produced base-line Ca2+ oscillations, the frequency of which increased with the stimulus strength (Fig. 1A). At NA concentrations above 10-6m a steady-state plateau level of Ca2+ was observed (Fig. 1A). In contrast, although oscillatory Ca2+ responses were occasionally observed at low agonist doses (data not shown) (10Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), in most cells examined, concentrations of methacholine (MCH) of 10-8m and above produced a peak and plateau Ca2+ response (Fig. 1B). Oscillatory Ca2+ signals in CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells, occurring via cyclical changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (12Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), differed from those observed with either NA or MCH in CHOα1B/M3 cells, in that they were largely of constant frequency and did not saturate with increasing agonist concentration. Thus at the lowest concentration of glutamate investigated (l-Glu, 10-6m), base-line Ca2+ transients could be observed (Fig. 1C). Increasing the concentration of l-Glu to 3 × 10-6m increased the frequency of these base-line oscillations, but further increasing the concentration of l-Glu even up to 3 × 10-4m had no additional effects on the Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1C). Receptor-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3Oscillations in CHO Cells— Simultaneous single cell measurements of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (using eGFP-PHPLCδ1) and Ca2+ mobilization (using fura-2) demonstrated that although the α1B and M3 receptors are co-expressed at similar levels in the CHOα1B/M3 cells, the muscarinic M3 receptor stimulates ∼10-fold more Ins(1,4,5)P3 production at maximal agonist concentrations (Fig. 2A). In contrast, due to the large degree of amplification between Ins(1,4,5)P3 production and subsequent Ca2+ mobilization (17Thompson N.T. Bonser R.W. Tateson J.E. Spacey G.D. Randall R.W. Hodson H.F. Garland L.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 103: 1592-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the peak Ca2+ responses produced by NA and MCH were not significantly different (Fig. 2A, inset, measured simultaneously from the same cells as Fig. 2A, main panel). When temporal changes in Ca2+ and Ins(1,4,5)P3 were co-imaged, small oscillatory changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 were observed during periods of NA-induced base-line Ca2+ spiking (Fig. 2B). However, due to the limited sensitivity of this method for detecting cytoplasmic changes in eGFP-PHPLCδ1, further experiments were conducted using confocal microscopy. Confocal imaging more clearly revealed the presence of an oscillatory Ins(1,4,5)P3 response to low concentrations of NA in CHOα1B/M3 cells. This was most prevalent with 10-7m NA, which was around the threshold level for Ins(1,4,5)P3 detection (Fig. 3B). Oscillatory Ins(1,4,5)P3 signals in response to 10-7m NA were characterized by a larger initial peak of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production (increase in F/F0 value of 0.40 ± 0.05 RFU, mean of 47 cells), followed by smaller transient increases of relatively consistent height (0.15 ± 0.01 RFU increase, 141 oscillations in 47 cells, measured during periods of base-line Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations). The average frequency of the Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations in response to 10-7m NA was 0.042 ± 0.003 Hz, or 1 peak every 23.6 s (47 cells). Increasing the concentration of NA altered the temporal dynamics of response, such that at 10-4m NA a peak and plateau increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 was observed (0.64 ± 0.09 RFU initial peak increase, and 0.35 ± 0.04 RFU increase after 120 s, 80–86 cells) (Fig. 3A). As already described above, the M3 receptor is more efficiently coupled to Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. In confocal measurements, the most common temporal profile of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to MCH was a robust peak and plateau response (Fig. 3C). At 10-4m MCH this corresponded to a 6.17 ± 0.28 RFU initial increase in F/F0, dropping to 4.93 ± 0.24 RFU increase after 120 s (39 cells). It should be noted that the greater level of stimulation observed, compared with the co-imaging data, is due to the lower initial cytosolic fluorescence in the confocal section. On rare occasions, small oscillatory responses were also observed with MCH stimulation (Fig. 3D). In three cells in which M3 receptor-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations were observed, the initial peak increase (0.16 ± 0.01 RFU) was smaller than that observed with 10-7m NA, as were the subsequent peaks (0.10 ± 0.01 RFU increase, 9 oscillations in three cells). The average frequency of these oscillations was 0.032 ± 0.001 Hz, or 1 every 31.2 s. Role of Ca2+and PKC in Single Cell Ins(1,4,5)P3Oscillations—NA-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+ oscillations appeared dependent on both mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (as they were inhibited by addition of the smooth endo-plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump inhibitor, thapsigargin (5 × 10-6m), Fig. 4B), and protein kinase activity (as they were inhibited by staurosporine (10-6m), Fig. 4C). In both cases, these inhibitors produced raised steady-state levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and [Ca2+]i in CHOα1B/M3 cells stimulated with 10-7m NA (Fig. 4). To investigate further the role of [Ca2+]i in NA-mediated IP3 production, CHOα1B/M3 cells were pretreated with thapsigargin (2 × 10-6m) in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (nominally Ca2+ free) for 5 min. Cells were then stimulated with NA (10-4m for 200 s) and then washed in normal KHB (containing 1.3 mm CaCl2) for 10 min, before being stimulated with NA (10-4m for 200 s) again. In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, NA produced an initial peak 0.59 ± 0.07 RFU increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels. This response declined to a near steady-state plateau phase of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, consisting of a 0.20 ± 0.03 RFU increase by 200 s (28 cells) (Fig. 5, A and B, plateau phase). After the 10-min wash period in 1.3 mm Ca2+, NA produced an initial peak Ins(1,4,5)P3 response that was only marginally greater than that observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (0.68 ± 0.09 RFU increase, 28 cells). However, the plateau phase of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, measured as a 0.40 ± 0.07 RFU increase at 200 s, was double that observed in nominally Ca2+-free conditions (p = 0.02, paired t test). Hence it would appear that the net effect of increases in [Ca2+]i are stimulatory to Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. It was of interest to note the same experiment, when conducted on CHO-lac-mGlu5a cells, produced the opposite result. Thus, mGluR5a stimulation after thapsigargin pretreatment was enhanced upon Ca2+ removal and reduced by Ca2+ readdition (12Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The effect of thapsigargin suggested that a positive feedback effect of Ca2+ on PLC activity could be the mechanism behind the observed NA-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations. To determine the dynamic range of this Ca2+-sensitive Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, Ca2+ and Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels in response to 10-4m NA were measured simultaneously, while extracellular Ca2+ was stepped from 1.3 to 1.0, 0.3, nominally Ca2+-free (0 Ca2+), and then back to 1.3 mM (Fig. 6). In this set of experiments, 10-4m NA in the presence of 1.3 mM extracellular Ca2+ produced peak and plateau Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+ responses. Although changing extracellular Ca2+ to 1.0 mm caused the plateau level of [Ca2+]i to drop from 332 ± 26 to 243 ± 27 nm, no alteration in the level of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was observed (Fig. 6). However, further stepwise decreases in extracellular Ca2+ to 0.3 mM and nominally Ca2+-free resulted in a decline in NA-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production toward prestimulated levels. The exact point at which decreases in [Ca2+]i began to affect Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels varied between 70 and 170 nm depending on the cell examined (mean 120 ± 7 nm, 21 cells). On the return of 1.3 mm Ca2+ to the perfusing buffer, Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels increased with rising Ca2+ (Fig. 6). However, again Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was not sensitive to the full dynamic range of intracellular Ca2+. Thus, depending on the individual cell, Ins(1,4,5)P3 levels increased with [Ca2+]i up to 83–260 nm (mean 184 ± 15 nm, 18 cells). After this point, further increases in intracellular Ca2+ did not additionally enhance NA-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Stimulation of PLC activity by MCH (10-5m) was similarly sensitive to changes in [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Although the above data strongly suggests that Ca2+ feedback could be the driving force for NA-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations, the observation that both Ca2+ and Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations could be inhibited by staurosporine (Fig. 4C) also suggested a role for protein kinases. As PKC-mediated negative feedback dynamically controls mGluR5a oscillations (9Kawabata S. Tsutsumi R. Kohara A. Yamaguchi T. Nakanishi S. Okada M. Nature. 1996; 383: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), a potential role for PKC was also investigated. In addition to the effect on NA-mediated oscillatory responses (Fig. 4C), staurosporine (10-6m) also increased levels of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to maximal concentrations of NA (10-4m, 35 cells) (Fig. 7A). In contrast, MCH-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to 10-6 and 10-8m MCH appeared insensitive to staurosporine (Fig. 7, B and C, 34 and 40 cells, respectively). As staurosporine is a relatively broad spectrum inhibitor of protein kinases, the role of PKC in NA-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations was further examined by pretreating CHOα1B/M3 cells for 20–24 h with the phorbol ester PDBu (1 μm), as part of an established protocol to down-regulate PKC isoforms (6Harootunian A.T. Kao J.P.Y. Paranjape S. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1991; 251: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This treatment enhanced Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to both low and high concentrations of NA (Fig. 8, A and C). Thus the mean peak increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to 10-7m NA in PDBu-treated cells was 1.16 ± 0.17 RFU, followed by a raised plateau level of 1.05 ± 0.17 RFU (29 cells). This represents a 5-fold increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production compared with non-PDBu-treated cells (see above) (Fig. 8, A and B). Due to this enhanced stimulus strength, no oscillations in Ins(1,4,5)P3 were observed with applications of 10-7m NA. Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in response to 10-4m NA was similarly affected. In this case, after PDBu treatment, the mean peak increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production was 3.37 ± 0.14 RFU, whereas the plateau level was 2.96 ± 0.12 RFU, again representing a 5-fold increase compared with non-treated cells (75 cells) (Fig. 8, C and D). In comparison, experiments examining Ca2+ signals in PDBu pretreated cells loaded with fura-2AM indicated that under these PKC down-regulated conditions, 10-7m NA produced a peak and plateau Ca2+ response, with oscillations in [Ca2+]i only being observed at lower agonist concentrations (data not shown). Furthermore, when Ins(1,4,5)P3 responses in PDBu pretreated CHOα1B/M3 cells were examined at these lower concentrations, it was found that concentrations of NA that were sub-threshold for Ins(1,4,5)P3 production in control conditions (3 × 10-9 to 10-8m) now produced oscillations in Ins(1,4,5)P3 (observed in 8 cells) (Fig. 8E). This suggests that PKC inhibition alters the stimulus strength of α1B-mediated responses rather than the oscillatory dynamics of Ins(1,4,5)P3 production. Furthermore, although M3 receptor activation was capable of stimulating oscillations in Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Fig. 3D), MCH-induced Ins(1,4,5)P3 responses appeared insensitive to PDBu pretreatment. Thus 10-6m MCH produced peak and plateau increases in Ins(1,4,5)P3 of 3.98 ± 0.02 and 2.50 ± 0.16 RFU, respectively, under control conditions (50 cells), and peak and plateau increases of 3.51 ± 0.20 and 2.99 ± 0.17 RFU, respectively, in cells pretreated with 10-6m PDBu for 24 h (48 cells). Differential Ins(1,4,5)P3Oscillations Induced by Noradrenergic α1Band mGlu5a Receptors—To compare the Ca2+ feedback-mediated Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations observed with α1B receptor activation with the PKC feedback-mediated mGluR5a Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillations described previously (10Nash M.S. Young K.W. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J.

Stimulation of mGluR5a-transfected CHOα1B/M3 cells with l-Glu appeared to stimulate two distinct types of Ins(1,4,5)P3 oscillation (Fig. 9). Low concentrations of l-Glu (3 × 10-6m) produced small transient oscillations in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production of relatively constant magnitude. The amount of Ins(1,4,5)P3 produced by each transient was similar to that observed with low levels of NA stimulation (Figs. 3 and 4) and consisted of a 0.18 ± 0.02 RFU transient initial peak, followed by further transient increases of 0.17 ± 0.01 RFU (70 oscillations from 22 to 25 cells) (Fig. 9). These transient increases occurred with a frequency of 0.024 ± 0.002 Hz, or one every 41.7 s (24Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, and in contrast to the effect of increasing levels of α1B receptor stimulation, oscillations in Ins(1,4,5)P3 production were s"

Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase (XDH 1The abbreviations used are: XDH, xanthine dehydrogenase; XO, xanthine oxidase; MPT, molybdopterin; Moco, molybdenum cofactor; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; EXAFS, extended X-ray absorption fine structure; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; T, Tesla. /XO) is a complex metallo-flavoprotein catalyzing the oxidative hydroxylation of purines, pyrimidines, pterines, and aldehyde substrates using NAD+ or molecular oxygen as electron acceptor. Mammalian XDH (EC 1.1.1.204) is a homodimer (290 kDa), with each subunit containing a single molybdenum cofactor (Moco) as well as two iron-sulfur clusters and an FAD molecule. Inherited XDH deficiency, referred to as xanthinuria I, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by hyperuricemia, hyperuricosuria, and xanthinuria and is based on base pair exchanges in the structural gene for XDH (1Simmonds H.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1781-1797Google Scholar). The affected individuals may develop urinary tract calculi, acute renal failure, or myositis, because of tissue deposition of xanthine, although some subjects with homozygous xanthinuria remain asymptomatic (1Simmonds H.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 1781-1797Google Scholar). Several mutations in the human XDH gene in patients with classical xanthinuria have been reported (2Ichida K. Amaya Y. Kamatani N. Nishino T. Hosoya T. Sakai O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Levartovsky D.L.A. Sperling O. Liberman U. Yaron M. Hosoya T. Ichida K. Peretz H.

In their native form, mammalian xanthine oxidizing enzymes exist as dehydrogenases that transfer electrons to NAD but can undergo a dehydrogenase to oxidase conversion by proteolytic cleavage or by oxidation, with the concomitant loss of the ability to use NAD+ as electron acceptor, and nearly 10-fold increase in the oxidase activity. The crystal structures of bovine milk XDH in both the dehydrogenase and oxidase forms have been solved at 2.1 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively (5Enroth C. Eger B.T. Okamoto K. Nishino T. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10723-10728Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It was shown that during the conversion of XDH to XO, a specific structural rearrangement blocks access of NAD+ to its binding site near the FAD moiety and changes the electrostatic environment of the bound FAD, reflecting the switch of electron acceptor specificity observed for the two forms of this enzyme. A well characterized prokaryotic XDH with similar activity to the mammalian enzymes is the enzyme isolated from the phototrophic purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus (6Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) Despite the similarities to the mammalian XDH enzymes, R. capsulatus XDH, like avian XDH, is isolated with high reactivity toward NAD+ and low reactivity toward oxygen as electron acceptor and does not undergo the conversion to the oxidase form. R. capsulatus XDH is a cytoplasmic enzyme with an (αβ)2 heterotetrameric structure and a molecular mass of 275 kDa. The enzyme is encoded by two genes, xdhA and xdhB, with the FeS clusters and FAD bound to the XDHA subunit and Moco bound to the XDHB subunit. A third protein, designated XDHC, was shown to be essential for XDH activity in R. capsulatus but was not found to be a subunit of active XDH (7Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because XDH isolated from an R. capsulatus xdhC mutant strain was shown to be Moco-deficient, the role of XDHC for XDH activity was proposed to be related to the insertion of Moco into XDHB during the assembly of XDH. The crystal structure of R. capsulatus XDH has been solved recently at 2.7 Å resolution (8Truglio J.J. Theis K. Leimkuhler S. Rappa R. Rajagopalan K.V. Kisker C. Structure. 2002; 10: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), showing that the bacterial and bovine XDH have highly similar folds despite differences in subunit composition. However, the two structures differ in important details, including the regions necessary for XDH to XO conversion. Because of the high structural similarities of the mammalian XDH/XO and R. capsulatus XDH, the bacterial enzyme is a good model system for studying the mechanism of the enzyme and can be used for the generation of site-specific mutants. In this report we describe the establishment of a recombinant expression system for R. capsulatus XDH in Escherichia coli cells, as well as the biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme. The recombinant protein resembles bovine XO in its absorption spectrum and its wide range of substrate specificity but is about 5 times more active compared with the mammalian enzymes. The enzyme has been also examined using x-ray absorption and EPR spectroscopy. EPR analysis of the FeS centers showed two characteristic EPR signals for FeSI and FeSII seen with all members of the xanthine oxidase family (9Hille R. Hagen W.R. Dunham W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10569-10575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the molybdenum and tungsten K-edge/LIII-edge, respectively, have been used to compare the active sites of the native and tungsten-substituted enzymes. Because the heterologous expression system of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli allows purification of sufficient enzyme for structural and kinetic studies, it is a useful tool for the generation of site-specific mutants for structural and biochemical studies. By using this system, the structural bases of xanthinuria I can be examined that will help to explain different symptoms of the disease. Based on a mutation identified in a patient suffering from xanthinuria I, arginine 135 was substituted to a cysteine in R. capsulatus XDH, and the protein variant was purified and characterized. Purified heterologously expressed XDH-R135C mutant contained two different protein forms in almost equal quantities, an active (αβ)2 heterotetramer and an inactive (αβ) heterodimer. Bacterial Strains, Media, and Growth Conditions—The E. coli TP1000 mutant strain used in this study is a derivative of MC4100 with a kanamycin cassette inserted in the mobAB gene region (10Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The E. coli RK5200 strain is a chlA::Mu cts mutant of RK4353 (11Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and pET15b were obtained from Novagen. The expression plasmid pTrcHis used for heterologous expression of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli was described previously (12Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For expression of pET15b-based plasmids, the λ DE3 lysogenization kit from Novagen was used to integrate the gene for T7 RNA polymerase into the E. coli strain RK4353 (11Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell strains containing expression plasmids were grown aerobically at 30 °C in LB medium in the presence of 150 μg/ml ampicillin. Phenyl-Sepharose resin was purchased from Amersham Bio-science; Q-Sepharose resin was purchased from Sigma, and Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Native XDH and Protein Variants—The genes encoding R. capsulatus XDH, designated xdhABC, were isolated from the R. capsulatus genome as described previously (6Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The published gene sequence (6Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was used to design primers that permitted cloning into the NdeI and HindIII sites of the expression vector pTrcHis (12Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, designated pSL207, contains the xdh genes with a His6 tag fused to the N terminus of XDHA. For heterologous expression in E. coli, pSL207 was transformed into E. coli TP1000 cells (10Palmer T. Santini C.-L. Iobbi-Nivol C. Eaves D.J. Boxer D.H. Giordano G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 875-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), containing a deletion in the mobAB genes responsible for Moco dinucleotide formation. The enzyme was expressed in 500-ml cultures of TP1000 cells carrying plasmid pSL207 grown at 30 °C in LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin, 1 mm molybdate, and 0.02 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside until the OD = 1. This culture was then transferred to a bottle containing 8 liters of supplemented LB medium and subsequently grown at 30 °C for 18–20 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 8 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and cell lysis was achieved by several passages through a French press. After addition of DNase I, the lysate was incubated for 30 min. After centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 25 min, imidazole was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 10 mm. The supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic agarose (Qiagen) per liter of cell growth, and the slurry was equilibrated with gentle stirring at 4 °C for 30 min. The slurry was poured into a column, and the resin was washed with 2 column volumes of 10 mm imidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, followed by a wash with 10 column volumes of the same buffer with 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged XDH was eluted with 100 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing XDH were combined and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. The dialyzed sample was applied to a Q-Sepharose fast protein liquid chromatography column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–250 mm NaCl. To the pool of fractions containing XDH, 15% ammonium sulfate was added, and the protein was then applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 15% ammonium sulfate, pH 7.5. XDH was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 15 to 0% ammonium sulfate. During purification, fractions were monitored using SDS-PAGE, whereas enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described earlier (6Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The yield of protein was about 12.5 mg/liter of E. coli culture. To obtain the tungsten-substituted form of XDH, the same growth conditions and purification procedures were used with the exception that the LB medium was supplemented with 5 mm tungstate instead of molybdate. For expression of xdhAB in the absence of xdhC, the NdeI-HindIII fragment from pSL207 was cloned into pET15b, and an XhoI fragment containing the coding region for xdhC was deleted from this plasmid by partial XhoI digest to generate plasmid pSL195. For expression, pSL195 was transformed into RK4353(DE3) cells and was grown under the same conditions as described above, and the protein was purified as described earlier. For expression of XDHA and XDHB subunits individually, primers were designed that permitted cloning of the xdhA coding sequence and the xdhBC coding sequence into the NdeI site of pET15b after PCR. These constructs resulted in an N-terminal His6 fusion of XDHA and XDHB, respectively. The expression plasmids for xdhA and xdhBC were designated pSL180 and pSL178, respectively. For expression, E. coli RK4353(DE3) cells were transformed with pSL178 and pSL180, and 6× 1 liter of transformed RK4353(DE3) cells were grown under the same conditions used for wild-type XDH as described above. The cell pellet was resuspended in 8 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and cell lysis was achieved by several passages through a French press. Site-directed Mutagenesis of XDH and Purification of XDH-R135C— The transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech) was employed for the generation of the single amino acid substitution R135C in R. capsulatus XDH. The nucleotide sequence substitution was verified by automated sequencing. To obtain the R135C variant for XDH the same growth conditions were used as described above. After chromatography on Q-Sepharose, the protein was gel-filtered on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Bioscience) using 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. Determination of the molecular weight of XDH-R135C variants was carried out using a Sephadex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. UV-visible Absorption Spectra—Absorption spectroscopy was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer. All spectra were recorded in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, using a 1-ml cuvette. For comparison spectra, bovine milk xanthine oxidase used was purified as described earlier (13Waud W.R. Brady F.O. Wiley R.D. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Molybdopterin (MPT) Analysis by Generation of Form A (Dephospho)—To determine the amount of Moco present in XDH, the purified proteins were subjected to a procedure that converts MPT to the stable oxidized fluorescent degradation product form A by treatment with iodine at pH 2.5 at room temperature (14Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. Arison B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with alkaline phosphatase, dephospho form A was identified by HPLC analysis with an Alltech C18 HPLC column in 50 mm ammonium acetate, 10% methanol at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Form A was assayed by monitoring its fluorescence with an excitation at 297 nm and emission at 440 nm. All HPLC analyses were performed using the Hewlett-Packard 1090 solvent delivery system, and the eluted material was monitored either for absorbance using a Hewlett-Packard 1040A diode array detector or for fluorescence using a Hewlett-Packard 1046 fluorescence detector. Trypsin Digestion of R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase—Purified R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase (1 mg/ml) was incubated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (2% w/v) in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at room temperature for 1 h prior to PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels under denaturing conditions. PAGE—For PAGE, protein samples were heated at 95 °C in buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Perfect protein markers from Novagen were used as molecular mass standard. Electrophoresis was carried out on 7.5 or 10% polyacrylamide ready gels (Bio-Rad), and the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R (Sigma). Enzyme Assays—All xanthine dehydrogenase assays were carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer. Assays were performed in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at room temperature in a final volume of 1 ml. Routine assay mixtures contained 100 μm xanthine. Enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically at 295 nm when xanthine or hypoxanthine was used as substrate or at 600 nm with 10 μm dichloroindophenol as electron acceptor when purine, pterin, acetaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, or 1-methylnicotinamide was used as substrate. The inhibition of enzyme activity by 100 μm allopurinol was analyzed in the presence of 100 μm xanthine as substrate, monitoring activity at 295 nm. Assays containing R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase were recorded in the presence of 100 μm NAD as electron acceptor, whereas for bovine milk xanthine oxidase O2 was used as electron acceptor. Cyanide Inactivation and Resulfuration of R. capsulatus XDH— R. capsulatus XDH (5 mg/ml) was incubated with 50 mm KCN in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, for 18 h at 4 °C. Excess cyanide was removed from the mixture by gel filtration using a PD10 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Desulfo-XDH was resulfurated by addition of 5 μl of 0.1 m dithionite and 1 μl of 0.5 m Na2S under anaerobic conditions using a Coy anaerobic chamber. After addition of Na2S and dithionite, the protein was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before excess sulfide was removed from the mixture by gel filtration. Analytical Methods—Phosphate was quantitated as described by Ames (15Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 8: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar); iron content was determined as described by Fish (16Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), and the FAD content was quantitated as described by Faeder and Siegel (17Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). For quantification of total protein concentrations, the Pierce BCA assay was used as described in the manufacturer's protocol, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded on JEOL RE1X or Bruker ER300 spectrometers equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 9 liquid helium cryostat. Samples were prepared as frozen solutions (typically ∼0.1 mm enzyme) in 3-mm diameter quartz tubes. Magnetic field was calibrated using a diphenylpicrylhyrdazyl standard, assuming g = 2.0037, and microwave frequency was determined using a Hewlett-Packard frequency counter. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—Measurements were carried out at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory with the SPEAR storage ring containing 60–100 mA at 3.0 GeV, on beamlines 9-3 and 7-3 operating with a wiggler field of 2.0 and 1.8 T, respectively, and using a Si(220) double crystal monochromator. Beamline 9-3 is equipped with a rhodium-coated collimating mirror upstream of the monochromator, and a bent cylindrical rhodium-coated focusing mirror downstream of the monochromator. Harmonic rejection was accomplished by setting the cut-off energy of the focusing mirror to 11, 13, or 23 keV for iron K-edge tungsten LIII edge and molybdenum K-edge measurements, respectively. The incident x-ray intensity was monitored using nitrogen-(for tungsten LIII experiments) or argon (for molybdenum K-edge experiments)-filled ionization chambers. The x-ray absorption was measured as the x-ray Kα for iron and molybdenum or Lα1 for tungsten fluorescence excitation spectrum using an array of 30 germanium intrinsic detectors (18Cramer S.P. Tench O. Yocum M. George G.N. Nucl. Instrum. Methods Phys. Res. 1988; 266: 586-591Crossref Scopus (267) Google Scholar). During data collection, samples were maintained at a temperature of ∼10 K using a liquid helium flow cryostat. For each sample between 6 and 10 35-min scans were accumulated, and the absorption of a standard metal foil was measured simultaneously by transmittance. The energy was calibrated with reference to the lowest energy inflection points of the metal foil standards, which were assumed to be 20,003.9, 10,207.0 and 7111.3 eV, for the molybdenum K-, tungsten LIII-, and iron K-edges, respectively. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) oscillations χ(k) were quantitatively analyzed by curve-fitting using the EXAFSPAK suite of computer programs 2The EXAFSPAK suite of computer programs are available on-line at ssrl.slac.stanford.edu/exafspak.html.

Heterologous Expression and Purification of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli—The conditions for the heterologous expression of R. capsulatus XDH described here were the same as reported for the expression of human sulfite oxidase in E. coli (12Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The protein was purified from an 8-liter E. coli culture by Ni-NTA chromatography, followed by chromatography on Q-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose (Table I). The purified protein displayed two discrete bands on Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-stained SDS gels (Fig. 1), corresponding to the XDHA (50 kDa) and XDHB (85 kDa) subunits of the protein (6Leimkühler S. Kern M. Solomon P.S. McEwan A.G. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 853-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). After coexpression of xdhAB with the xdhC gene in E. coli, no subunit corresponding to XDHC was identified after purification (Fig. 1). This result is in agreement with the data obtained after homologous expression of xanthine dehydrogenase in R. capsulatus (7Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showing that XDHC acts as a specific chaperone for XDH maturation but is itself not a subunit of the active enzyme.Table IPurification procedure of recombinant R. capsulatus XDH after expression in E. coli TP1000 cellsVolumeTotal proteinaTotal protein was quantitated with the Pierce BCA assay.Total activitybXanthine:NAD activity was assayed for R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase by monitoring the increase in absorption at 340 nm in the presence of 10 mM xanthine and 10 mM NAD.Specific activitycSpecific enzyme activity (units/mg) is defined as the reduction of μM NAD per min and mg of enzyme under assay conditions.mlmgunitsunits/mgCrude extract9008100NTdNT, not tested.NTdNT, not tested.Ni-NTA-agarose2901861237712.77Q-Sepharose100123165513.23Phenyl-Sepharose110100162716.23a Total protein was quantitated with the Pierce BCA assay.b Xanthine:NAD activity was assayed for R. capsulatus xanthine dehydrogenase by monitoring the increase in absorption at 340 nm in the presence of 10 mM xanthine and 10 mM NAD.c Specific enzyme activity (units/mg) is defined as the reduction of μM NAD per min and mg of enzyme under assay conditions.d NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab Characterization of the Role of XDHC for the Maturation of R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase in E. coli—Leimkühler and Klipp (7Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that in R. capsulatus XDHC is required for the insertion of Moco into the XDH tetramer, perhaps serving as a specific chaperone facilitating the insertion of the cofactor into the apoprotein. To determine whether XDHC is also required for the maturation of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli, R. capsulatus XDH was expressed in E. coli RK4353-(DE3) cells from plasmid pSL195 carrying the xdhAB genes only (see “;Experimental Procedures”). After expression, the protein was purified as described above. Analysis of enzyme activity showed that XDH expressed in the absence of xdhC was inactive. Surprisingly, analysis of the cofactor content of the protein showed that the protein contained Moco. As shown in Fig. 2, after conversion of protein-bound Moco to its oxidized fluorescent degradation product form A, HPLC analysis revealed the same amount of cofactor in XDH in the presence or absence of xdhC during expression. Thus, the role of XDHC in the maturation of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli is different from that observed for homologous expression of XDH in an R. capsulatus xdhC mutant strain. Identification of a Cyanolyzable Sulfur Ligand in R. capsulatus Xanthine Dehydrogenase—Xanthine dehydrogenase, xanthine oxidase, and aldehyde oxidase belong to a family of molydoenzymes characterized by a non-protein sulfur ligand to the molybdenum atom. This terminal sulfur atom is essential for enzyme activity and is released as thiocyanate upon inactivation of the enzyme with cyanide. Most preparations of xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase from eukaryotic sources contain varying fractions of demolybdo proteins and also contain desulfo molecules deficient in the cyanolyzable sulfur. However, the desulfo molecules can be activated by treatment with sulfide and dithionite under anaerobic conditions (22Wahl R.C. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1354-1359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, R. capsulatus XDH was inactivated by incubation with 2.5 mm cyanide at room temperature. After removal of excess cyanide, reactivation of the inactive enzyme required both sulfide and dithionite. In contrast, the activity of enzyme not treated with CN-was not enhanced by sulfide/dithionite treatment. These data firmly establish the presence of the terminal sulfur ligand in R. capsulatus XDH. To determine whether the Moco present in XDH expressed in the absence of xdhC contains the desulfo form of the cofactor or the demolybdo form, purified XDH expressed in the presence or absence of xdhC was subjected to treatment with sulfide and dithionite. As shown in Table II, XDH expressed in the absence of xdhC was activated by sulfide/dithionite treatment to the same extent as XDH expressed in the presence of xdhC and desulfurated by cyanide treatment. This observation shows that during heterologous expression of R. capsulatus XDH in E. coli, R. capsulatus XDHC is required for the sulfuration of Moco but not for the insertion of Moco into XDH, a situation that is different from the requirement of XDHC for cofactor insertion into XDH in the native host R. capsulatus (7Leimkühler S. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIInfluence of sulfide / dithionite on active R. capsulatus XDH, cyanide-inactivated XDH, and inactive XDH expressed in the absence of xdhCEnzymeTreatmentaThe concentrations of Na2S and sodium dithionite were used as described under “Experimental Procedures.”% XDH activi"
https://openalex.org/W2048293905,"Desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors observed after agonist activation are considered two important regulatory processes of receptor transduction. Endogenous human δ-opioid receptors (hDOR) are differentially regulated in terms of desensitization by peptide ([d-Pen2,5]enkephalin (DPDPE) and Deltorphin I) and alkaloid (etorphine) agonists in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE (Allouche, S., Roussel, M., Marie, N., and Jauzac, P. (1999) Eur. J. Pharmacol. 371, 235–240). In the present study, we examined the role of hDOR internalization and down-regulation in this differential desensitization. Sustained activation by peptides for 30 min caused a marked decrease of both [3H]diprenorphine binding sites and hDOR immunoreactivity, observed in a Western blot, whereas a moderate reduction by 30% was observed after a 30- and 60-min etorphine exposure in binding experiments without opioid receptor degradation. Using fluorescence microscopy, we visualized hDOR internalization promoted by different agonists in SK-N-BE cells expressing FLAG-tagged hDOR. Agonist withdrawal results in a greater recycling process correlated with a stronger hDOR resensitization after etorphine treatment compared with DPDPE or Deltorphin I, as shown in binding, immunocytochemical, and functional experiments. This suggests a distinct sorting of opioid receptors after their internalization. We demonstrated a lysosomal hDOR targeting upon peptides by using chloroquine in binding, Western blot, and immunocytochemical experiments and by colocalization of this receptor with a late endosome marker. In contrast, when the recycling endosome blocker monensin was used, acceleration of desensitization associated with a strong intracellular immunostaining was observed upon etorphine treatment. The possibility of separate endocytic pathways responsible for the differential sorting of hDOR upon peptide and alkaloid ligand exposure was ruled out by binding and immunocytochemical experiments using sucrose hypertonic solution. First, these results showed complex relationships between hDOR internalization/down-regulation and desensitization. Second, we demonstrated for the first time that the same receptor could undergo a distinct sorting after internalization by peptide and alkaloid agonists. Desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors observed after agonist activation are considered two important regulatory processes of receptor transduction.

First, these results showed complex relationships between hDOR internalization/down-regulation and desensitization. Second, we demonstrated for the first time that the same receptor could undergo a distinct sorting after internalization by peptide and alkaloid agonists. Opioid receptors are the targets of endogenous and exogenous opioid peptides and alkaloid agonists that bind these receptors with high affinity. The opioid receptor family is composed of three types, namely μ, δ, and κ, whose activation produces many effects including analgesia (1Pasternak G.W. Clinical Neuropharmacol. 1993; 16: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In vitro, the agonist-activated opioid receptors regulate, via heterotrimeric G proteins, downstream effectors such as adenylate cyclase, Ca2+ and K+ channels, phospholipase C (2Law P.Y. Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), and [Ca2+]i (3Allouche S. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1996; 6: 2461-2470Google Scholar). Upon prolonged activation (from hours to days), opioid receptors undergo down-regulation, a complex mechanism resulting from both internalization and degradation of receptors in lysosomes (4Hasbi A. Allouche S. Sichel F. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Landemore G. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 237-247PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ko J.L. Arvidsson U. Williams F.G. Law P.Y. Elde R. Loh H.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 69: 171-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, short time activation (from minutes to hours) promotes receptor translocation from plasma membrane into endosomes (or sequestration) that allows their redistribution back to the cell surface (6Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Hasbi A. Polastron J. Allouche S. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Beside the variation of opioid receptor number upon agonist treatment, a decrease of signal transduction from these receptors, a process known as desensitization, is frequently observed. However, the role of sequestration in desensitization is obviously ambiguous since, depending on the model under study, internalization can either contribute to desensitization by reducing functional receptors at the cellular membrane (8Sibley D.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) or conversely, can reduce desensitization by promoting receptor recycling to cell surface in an active state (6Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Hasbi A. Polastron J. Allouche S. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The most representative example of this complex relationship between desensitization and internalization is illustrated by the difference in desensitization kinetics of the two μ-opioid receptor isoforms (MOR1 and MOR1B). 1The abbreviations used are: MOR, μ-opioid receptors; mDOR, mouse δ-opioid receptors; DPDPE, [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin; Deltorphin I, Tyr-d-Ala-Phe-Asp-Val-Val-Gly-NH2; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; hDOR, human δ-opioid receptors; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ANOVA, analysis of variance; LBPA, lysobisphosphatidic acid. The relative resistance in desensitization of MOR1B is related to its rapid internalization, compared with MOR1, which allows its resensitization (6Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E. Höllt V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13652-13657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Conversely for the protease-activated receptor-1, internalization is directly responsible for the desensitization induced by thrombin (9Trejo J. Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Once internalized, receptors can be either targeted to lysosomes for their degradation or to endosomes for their recycling as demonstrated for the mouse δ-opioid receptors (mDOR) and for the β2-adrenergic receptors, respectively (10Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). While the C-terminal tail of GPCR seems to be a major determinant in the sorting process, the molecular mechanisms governing the targeting of sequestrated receptors to endosomes or lysosomes need to be clarified. Most of the studies carried out on opioid receptor desensitization and internalization have been realized on transfected non-neuronal cells overexpressing opioid receptors, which is known to directly affect the rate of both sequestration and desensitization (11Law P.Y. Maestri-El Kouhen O. Solberg J. Wang W. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32057-32065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The SK-N-BE cells represent a more suitable model to study these phenomena for several reasons. (i) This cell line presents the neuronal phenotype. (ii) It is a human cell line, and (iii) it expresses only endogenously δ-opioid receptors at physiological levels (12Polastron J. Mur M. Mazarguil H. Puget A. Meunier J.C. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 898-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Allouche S. Hasbi A. Ferey V. Sola B. Jauzac P. Polastron J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 8: 915-925Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Upon chronic activation, hDOR undergo a rapid desensitization that was observed on the inhibition of adenylate cyclase (14Namir N. Polastron J. Allouche S. Hasbi A. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Hasbi A. Polastron J. Allouche S. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported a differential regulation of those receptors by peptide and alkaloid agonists, which was characterized by a more robust desensitization in the presence of DPDPE and Deltorphin I than in the presence of etorphine (15Allouche S. Roussel M. Marie N. Jauzac P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 371: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and by a differential G protein activation (16Allouche S. Polastron J. Hasbi A. Homburger V. Jauzac P. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To address the possibility that this differential desensitization could be related to differences in opioid receptor trafficking, we performed a detailed comparison of hDOR internalization, down-regulation, recycling, desensitization, and resensitization produced by peptide (DPDPE and Deltorphin I) and alkaloid (etorphine) agonists. Visualization of δ receptor internalization was realized using immunofluorescence experiments within the SK-N-BE cells expressing the FLAG-tagged hDOR. Opioid receptor down-regulation and recycling were performed in SK-N-BE cells with binding studies to quantify the number of opioid binding sites. Desensitization and resensitization were determined by functional assays on the inhibition of cAMP accumulation. In this work, we demonstrated a complex relationship between hDOR internalization/down-regulation and desensitization. We found that the profound desensitization of hDOR promoted by DPDPE and Deltorphin I was correlated with a marked down-regulation of the receptor. While etorphine promoted a strong hDOR desensitization and internalization after a 60-min period, we found no evidence for down-regulation. Exploring the postendocytic fate of hDOR demonstrated that the differential targeting, either to lysosomes for peptide agonists or to recycling endosomes for etorphine, would account for the different rate of desensitization rather than down-regulation. Cell Culture and Transfection—SK-N-BE cells, endogenously expressing hDOR, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mixture (Sigma), and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To visualize hDOR internalization by fluorescence and confocal microscopy, SK-N-BE cells were transfected by electroporation with pcDNA3 alone or containing the cDNA encoding for the FLAG-tagged-hDOR (pcDNA3-hDOR). Stably transfected cells were obtained after selection with 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Sigma), and the whole pool of resistant cells was used without clonal selection. Binding Experiments—Radioligand binding studies were performed on attached cells as described previously (4Hasbi A. Allouche S. Sichel F. Stanasila L. Massotte D. Landemore G. Polastron J. Jauzac P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 237-247PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SK-N-BE cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 75,000–100,000 cells/well. Monolayers of cell were treated for various times (30 or 60 min) in the presence of peptide or alkaloid agonists at 37 °C in DMEM/20 mm Hepes buffer. When inhibitors of either internalization (0.5 m sucrose) or lysosomal degradation (200 μm chloroquine) were used, cells were preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 or 5 min, respectively. In recycling assays, the medium was removed, and SK-N-BE cells were left in DMEM/20 mm Hepes buffer for 30 min. Before binding studies, cells were rinsed with DMEM/20 mm Hepes buffer followed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.2% (w/v), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with appropriate concentrations of [3H]diprenorphine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (0.05–5 nm) in the presence (nonspecific binding) or in the absence (total binding) of 20 μm levorphanol (Sigma), in a final volume of 300 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4. The efficiency of washing procedure was checked using control and agonist-pretreated cells. Under these conditions it is worthy to note that no modification of [3H]diprenorphine binding was detected, indicating that the agonist was completely removed (data not shown). Cells were harvested in 200 μl of 1 m NaOH and placed into vials in the presence of 3 ml of a scintillation mixture (PicoFluor-40, Packard). Vials were counted for radioactivity in a scintillation counter (Packard). Each determination was carried out in triplicate. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Scatchard analysis was performed using Ligand software (17McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1985; 14: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar) to calculate Kd and Bmax values. Determination of cAMP Accumulation—Inhibition of adenylate cyclase was determined by measuring [3H]cAMP accumulation. SK-N-BE cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000–150,000 cells/well in the presence of 0.6 μCi/well [3H]adenine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 12–15 h. Then, cells were challenged with or without different agonists, in the presence of 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 40 μm forskolin for 5 min at 37 °C. When using inhibitors, SK-N-BE cells were pretreated for 5 min (200 μm chloroquine) or 30 min (0.5 m sucrose and 50 μm monensin). The reaction was stopped by removing the medium and by addition of 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. [3H]cAMP was separated by chromatography on acid alumina columns, mixed with 8 ml of scintillation mixture (PicoFluor-40, Packard), before assaying in a scintillation counter (Packard). Percentage of inhibition was calculated according to the following formula: (1–(cpm agonist–cpm basal)/(cpm forskolin–cpm basal)) × 100, where cpm basal was determined in a medium containing only IBMX and cpm forskolin in the presence of forskolin + IBMX. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Western Blot Analysis—SK-N-BE cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) and sonicated after a preincubation period of 30 min in DMEM with or without opioid agonists (10 nm Deltorphin I, 100 nm etorphine, and DPDPE). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes over 45 min at a constant voltage of 15 V. Membranes were incubated for 2 h in blocking solution (PBS, 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against amino acids 3–17 of mDOR (Oncogene) were added for 15 h at 4 °C in a final dilution of 1:1,000 in PBS, 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk. After washing in PBS, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (DAKO) (1:1,000 in PBS, 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) for 3–4 h. hDOR was revealed using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunolocalization of δ-Opioid Receptors by Fluorescence Microscopy—SK-N-BE cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hDOR were grown on alcohol-cleaned glass coverslips in 24-well plates in culture medium containing 0.5 mg/ml geneticin until 40–60% confluence. Then, cells were either exposed to vehicle (control) or different agonists as described above in DMEM/20 mm Hepes. When inhibitors of internalization (sucrose), recycling (monensin), or lysosomal degradation (chloroquine) were used, cells were pretreated under similar conditions as described above. The medium was rapidly removed, and cells were fixed using a fresh solution of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin. Cells were rinsed thoroughly with PBS. After blocking with PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA for 1 h at room temperature, cells were incubated with the monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) (5 μg/ml) in the blocking buffer for1hat37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of fluoresceine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted. Immunostaining was visualized either with a Zeiss confocal laser microscope (LSM-310) or with a Zeiss Axiovert (Lens X63). Photographs shown in this article were obtained with a CCD camera. Colocalization of FLAG-tagged hDOR with Lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA)—SK-N-BE cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hDOR were grown and exposed to different agonists as described above. The medium was rapidly removed, and cells were fixed using a fresh solution of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min and subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% (w/v) saponin. Cells were rinsed thoroughly with PBS. After blocking with PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA for 30 min at room temperature, cells were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (5 μg/ml) in the blocking buffer for1hat37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer. Cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with the mouse anti-LBPA antibody with a 1:150 dilution in PBS, 1% (w/v) BSA, 0.05% (w/v) saponin for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, cells were incubated with a 1:400 dilution of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates) for 2 h at room temperature in the blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed with PBS and mounted. Images were collected with a Nikon confocal microscope (Eclipse TE-2000, lens ×60) and processed with Adobe Photoshop software. After overlaying green and red labeling, we extracted only the overlapping signal that was converted into grayscale. The merged pictures represent colocalization of FLAG-tagged hDOR with LBPA. Statistical Analysis—All results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of n experiments. ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni-Dunn test or Student's t test as appropriate was used to determine the statistical significance (Statview, Abacus). Down-regulation of δ-Opioid Receptors Induced by Peptide and Alkaloid Agonists—Previously, we reported in the SK-N-BE cell line that peptide agonists, DPDPE and Deltorphin I, promoted a faster desensitization of hDOR after a 30-min pretreatment when compared with an alkaloid agonist, etorphine (15Allouche S. Roussel M. Marie N. Jauzac P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 371: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine the reduction of [3H]diprenorphine binding sites, the same conditions as in Ref. 15Allouche S. Roussel M. Marie N. Jauzac P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 371: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar were used corresponding to the concentration of the agonist producing the maximal and an identical inhibition of cAMP accumulation (10 nm Deltorphin I, 100 nm DPDPE, and etorphine). In naive cells, determination of Bmax values by Scatchard analysis revealed a number of hDOR ranging between 100 and 150 fmol/mg of protein and was considered as 100%. While etorphine pretreatment produced a reduction of opioid binding sites by ∼30% after a 30-min period, a significantly greater decrease of ∼50% was observed with peptides (50 ± 4.9% for DPDPE and 50.5 ± 6.6% for Deltorphin I versus 29.7 ± 0.8% for etorphine, ANOVA, Bonferroni-Dunn test, p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A). When etorphine pretreatment was prolonged until 60 min, no further significant difference in opioid binding site decrease was noted with SK-N-BE cells pretreated with etorphine for 30 min (Fig. 1A). It is worthy to note that no significant modification of Kd values was observed after agonist pretreatment (data not shown). Western blot analysis was performed to correlate the reduction of [3H]diprenorphine binding sites with the hDOR immunoreactivity in naive and agonist-treated SK-N-BE cells (Fig. 1B). The polyclonal mDOR antibody detected a major band of ∼50 kDa in the whole SK-N-BE cell extracts whereas in human fibroblast, no labeling could be observed (data not shown) demonstrating the specificity of the mDOR antibody. A decrease of hDOR immunoreactivity was evident in cells treated with peptides (Dp, Del) for 30 min compared with naive cells (cont) while no significant modification was detected after etorphine pretreatment (Fig. 1B). Internalization of δ-Opioid Receptors Induced by Peptide and Alkaloid Agonists—Localization of hDOR in SK-N-BE cells was determined by immunocytochemical experiments in naive and agonist-treated cells using the polyclonal mDOR antibody. Under these conditions, a weak but specific immunolabeling was observed as a sharp staining at the plasma membrane of naive cells. However, upon agonist treatment we could only detect a loss of the staining without clearly visualizing opioid receptor internalization. To overcome this problem, immunofluorescence experiments on FLAG-tagged hDOR cells were conducted. Binding experiments revealed about 15–20-fold more opioid receptors in FLAG-tagged hDOR cells compared with SK-N-BE cells (Table I) and pcDNA3-transfected cells (data not shown). Overexpression of FLAG-tagged hDOR does modify neither the affinity of δ-opioid receptors for [3H]diprenorphine nor the ability of the different agonists to promote opioid receptor desensitization (Table I).Table IComparison of binding parameters and desensitization between SK-N-BE cells and FLAG-tagged hDOR transfected SK-N-BE cellsSK-N-BEhDOR/FLAGBinding parametersKd (nM)0.70 ± 0,151.26 ± 0,29Bmax (fmol/mg of protein)134 ± 92652 ± 169Desensitization (%)Etorphine 100 nM, 60 min83.4 ± 5.782.1 ± 5.8DPDPE 100 nM, 30 min82.3 ± 2.688.8 ± 8.9Deltorphin I 10 nM, 30 min86.1 ± 5,696.8 ± 1,5 Open table in a new tab While in non-transfected (data not shown) or pcDNA3-transfected SK-N-BE cells, no staining was detected (Fig. 2, pcDNA3), a strong immunofluorescent labeling could be visualized in FLAG-tagged hDOR-transfected cells (Fig. 2, Cont). Using confocal microscopy and sequential sections of cells, we confirmed that the immunostaining was confined to the plasma membrane. After 30 min of DPDPE and Deltorphin I exposure, an obvious loss of hDOR immunoreactivity from plasma membrane associated with a concomitant appearance of cytoplasmic punctiform staining was observed (Fig. 2, Dp 30 and Del 30). As shown in Fig. 2 (Eto 60), when FLAG-tagged hDOR-transfected cells were incubated in the presence of the alkaloid agonist for 30 (data not shown) or 60 min, a strong vesicular labeling was observed with a marked decrease of the plasma membrane staining. Analysis using confocal microscopy confirmed the cytosolic localization of the internalized opioid receptor. Recycling and Resensitization of hDOR—To investigate the recycling process of hDOR in an active state, SK-N-BE and FLAG-tagged hDOR transfected cells were either treated for 30 min with DPDPE and Deltorphin I or 60 min with etorphine to obtain a strong internalization and almost a similar desensitization (14Namir N. Polastron J. Allouche S. Hasbi A. Jauzac P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1764-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Allouche S. Roussel M. Marie N. Jauzac P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 371: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Then, cells were placed in an agonist-free medium for 30 min to allow the recycling of opioid receptors. Under these conditions and concerning the alkaloid agonist, immunofluorescence assay revealed a reappearance of the staining at the plasma membrane consistent with binding experiments showing an identical level of opioid receptors as in naive cells (Figs. 1A and 2, Eto 60 + 30). Conversely, for peptide agonists, a substantial loss of [3H]diprenorphine binding sites was still noticed (30 ± 7.1% for DPDPE and 28.7 ± 10% for Deltorphin I) (Fig. 1A). As depicted in Fig. 2 and in these conditions, we still noticed few scattered intracellular vesicles but associated with a progressive reappearance of the immunostaining localized at the plasma membrane demonstrating a partial recycling process (Fig. 2, Dp 30 + 30 and Del 30 + 30). Functional experiments were further conducted on the inhibition of adenylate cyclase to ensure that the recovery of opioid binding sites was associated with a hDOR resensitization. When activated by the alkaloid and peptide agonists, hDOR inhibited cAMP accumulation by 50 and 40%, respectively. To ensure comparison between agonists, the inhibition produced by each molecule was referred as 100% in naive cells. SK-N-BE cells were first incubated for 30 or 60 min in the presence of peptides or etorphine, respectively, to promote a similar desensitization of about 80–90% (Fig. 3). hDOR were allowed to resensitize in an agonist-free medium for various times (15 and 30 min), and then the inhibition produced by each agonist was measured. Fig. 3 shows that etorphine-pretreated cells displayed a faster resensitization than peptide-treated cells. However, this difference of resensitization between etorphine and peptides reached a statistical significance only after a 30-min period in agonist-free medium. Lysosomal Degradation after Peptide-induced hDOR Sequestration—After internalization, GPCR are either recycled to plasma membrane, trapped in endosomal compartments or targeted to lysosomes. The latter contains proteases that can be inhibited by chemicals such as chloroquine by elevating the luminal pH. Data presented in the Figs. 1, 2, 3 strongly suggested that peptide-induced hDOR internalization would be followed by their degradation since, unlike etorphine, no complete recovery of opioid receptors was observed when cells were left in agonist-free medium for 30 min. To assess this hypothesis, binding, immunofluorescence, and functional studies were carried out using 200 μm chloroquine, a concentration known to inhibit mDOR degradation in lysosomes (10Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). SK-N-BE cells were pretreated with chloroquine for 5 min and, to induce down-regulation and desensitization, agonists were then added in the same conditions as described above. As shown in Fig. 4A, chloroquine pretreatment did not affect the loss of opioid receptors induced by etorphine. In contrast, we could observe a significant decrease in the ability of peptide agonists (from 50 to 95%) to induce down-regulation of hDOR but with a more pronounced effect for Deltorphin I than DPDPE. Immunoblot experiments were conducted in the presence or in the absence of the lysosomal proteases inhibitor and showed no difference between naive cells indicating that chloroquine was devoid of any effect on basal level of hDOR. Data presented in Fig. 4B indicated that peptide-induced decrease of hDOR immunoreactivity, observed in Fig. 1B, was totally blocked by chloroquine pretreatment. Effects of chloroquine were further explored in internalization experiments. SK-N-BE cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged hDOR were treated or not for 30 min with DPDPE or Deltorphin I in the presence or in the absence of chloroquine. All these results are depicted in Fig. 4C and suggest both an enhancement of the intracellular vesicle staining and the number of those vesicles compared with chloroquine-untreated transfected cells (Fig. 4C, see arrows). To corroborate all the data obtained with chloroquine that strongly argued for an opioid receptor degradation in lysosomes after peptide pretreatment, we investigated a putative l"

An evolutionarily conserved auto-inhibitory sequence within the N-terminal importin β binding (IBB) domain of importin α regulates NLS-cargo binding to the NLS binding pocket on importin α. In this study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis coupled with in vitro binding assays and in vivo analyses to investigate the intramolecular interaction of the N-terminal IBB domain and the NLS binding pocket of Saccharomyces cerevisiae importin α, Srp1p. We find that mutations within the IBB domain that decrease the binding affinity of the auto-inhibitory sequence for the NLS binding pocket impact importin α function in vivo. In addition, the severity of the in vivo phenotype is directly correlated to the reduction of auto-inhibition measured in vitro, suggesting that the in vivo phenotypes are directly related to the loss of auto-inhibitory function. We exploit a conditional auto-inhibitory mutant, srp1–55, to study the in vivo functional overlap between the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α and other factors implicated in NLS-cargo release, Cse1p and Nup2p.

All macromolecules that move into and out of the nucleus are transported through nuclear pore complexes, large proteinaceous channels that are embedded in the nuclear envelope (1Wente S.R.

These classical NLSs are typified by a single cluster of basic amino acids (monopartite) or two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10–12-amino acid linker (bipartite) (6Kalderon D.

Protein cargoes that contain classical NLSs are recognized in the cytoplasm by a heterodimeric receptor composed of importin/karyopherin α and importin/karyopherin β (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev.

Importin α recognizes and binds the NLS, and importin β translocates the trimeric import complex through the nuclear pore (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Delivery into the nucleus is dependent on the small GTPase Ran, which governs the interactions between the nuclear transport receptors and macromolecular cargoes and thus confers directionality to nucleocytoplasmic transport (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar, 11Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W.

Once the cargo is delivered into the nucleus, the transport receptors are recycled to the cytoplasm (3Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). Release of NLS-cargo into the nucleus is essential for both the function of the cargo and for recycling of the nuclear transport receptors to the cytoplasm (11Kuersten S. Ohno M. Mattaj I.W.

Thus, once the NLS-cargo·importin α·importin β complex reaches the nuclear face of the pore, the complex must be disassembled to deliver the cargo to the nuclear interior and to recycle the import receptors in an NLS-free state. The best characterized signal for the dissociation of the import complex is RanGTP-dependent dissociation of importin β from the trimeric complex (16Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 17Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol.

In the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin β, which causes a conformational change in importin β that results in the release of importin α (20Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). RanGTP-triggered dissociation of importin β generates a transient NLS·importin α complex. The mechanism of NLS-cargo dissociation from importin α is not as well characterized, although recent studies suggest that the importin α export receptor, Cse1p, the nucleoporin, Nup2p, and the N-terminal auto-inhibitory domain of importin α could all play a role (19Gilchrist D.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18161-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cse1p and Nup2p can facilitate release of NLS-cargo in vitro. Furthermore, our recent data support a model where the autoinhibitory domain of importin α couples the Ran-dependent dissociation of importin β with the subsequent release of NLS-cargo from importin α (23Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, these factors may cooperate or act sequentially to facilitate NLS-cargo release. It is not yet clear, however, how this occurs or how these factors functionally interact in vivo. Domain analysis shows that importin α has an N-terminal domain that binds importin β (the importin β binding domain; IBB), a central armadillo domain that constitutes the NLS binding pocket, and a C-terminal region that appears to be important for binding to the export receptor Cse1p (14Herold A. Truant R. Wiegand H. Cullen B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 309-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 18Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6572-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The structure of mouse importin α revealed that the N-terminal IBB domain of importin α can form an intramolecular interaction with the NLS binding pocket of importin α (22Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This observation suggested that the IBB, in addition to mediating binding to importin β, could also regulate cargo binding through an auto-inhibitory mechanism (22Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This may occur through competition between the IBB and NLS-cargo for binding to the NLS binding pocket of importin α, which could facilitate the release of cargo into the nucleus. Additionally, the IBB could prevent NLS-cargo rebinding once it has been released. Thus, the IBB appears to act as a regulatory switch between the cytoplasmic form of importin α, which has a high affinity for NLS-cargo because of binding to importin β, and the nuclear form, which has a low affinity for NLS-cargo. Importin α structural studies suggest that monopartite NLSs and the auto-inhibitory sequence bind to the NLS binding pocket of importin α in a similar manner (22Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Conti E. Uy M. Leighton L. Blobel G. Kuriyan J.

Indeed, a conserved cluster of basic amino acids, which resembles a classical basic NLS, serves as the auto-inhibitory sequence (yeast importin α residues 54KRR56) (22Kobe B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis of the energetic landscape of NLS sequences binding to importin α revealed details of the specific interactions required for NLS binding to the pocket of importin α (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In particular, Hodel et al. (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) defined the requirements for specific amino acid residues within an NLS that are critical for high affinity interaction with importin α. We hypothesize that the auto-inhibitory sequence depends on similar energetic molecular interactions with the NLS binding pocket. This would be consistent with its role in NLS-cargo release through a direct competition mechanism. The present study further characterizes the auto-inhibitory sequence within the N-terminal domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae importin α. We have utilized site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro binding assays, and in vivo analyses to investigate the intramolecular interaction between the N-terminal IBB domain and the NLS binding pocket of importin α. Through these analyses we demonstrate that the auto-inhibitory sequence binds to the NLS binding pocket through energetic interactions that are analogous to those for a monopartite NLS. We present data in support of our hypothesis that the auto-inhibitory function of the IBB domain is responsible for essential in vivo functions. Our experiments demonstrate that the severity of the in vivo phenotypes are directly correlated to the reduction of auto-inhibition measured in vitro, suggesting that the in vivo phenotypes are directly related to the loss of auto-inhibitory function. Furthermore, we present data in support of functional overlap between the N-terminal domain of importin α, Cse1p, and Nup2p in vivo. We propose that the auto-inhibitory N-terminal domain of importin α and Cse1p function together in NLS-cargo release, whereas Nup2p functions through a different mechanism in this essential process.

Open table in a new tab Generation of Importin α Mutants—Amino acid substitutions were introduced in the S. cerevisiae importin α (SRP1) coding region using PCR. For most mutants, mutagenesis was carried out on importin α in the bacterial expression vector pProEX-HTb (Invitrogen). DNA containing the mutations was subcloned from the bacterial expression vector into the yeast expression plasmid for in vivo studies. For all constructs generated, the presence of each desired mutation and the absence of any other mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Assays were performed with purified recombinant S. cerevisiae proteins Srp1p (importin α) and Rsl1p (importin β). Full-length His6-importin α (residues 1–542), His6-SV40 (SPKKKRKVEAS)-NLS-GFP, and His6-Myc (PAA-KRVKLD)-NLS-GFP were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by nickel affinity chromatography essentially as described (26Hodel M.R.

Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21218-21223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Anisotropy Assay—Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were carried out using an ISS PC1 fluorometer fitted with polarization filters. The dissociation constants for the binding of SV40-NLS-GFP and Myc-NLS-GFP to importin α were measured essentially as described previously (26Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1317-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 29Fanara P. Hodel M.R. Corbett A.H. Hodel A.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, SV40-NLS-GFP or Myc-NLS-GFP was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline to the desired concentration (∼20 nm) in a total volume of 1 ml in a 1-cm quartz cuvette. Changes in the anisotropy of the GFP fluorophore were monitored as increasing amounts of wild-type or mutant importin α proteins were added to the assay volume. Changes in anisotropy were used to calculate the fraction of the GFP fluorophore bound, yielding a binding isotherm for the reaction. The binding isotherm was then fit through nonlinear regression to a simple binding equation to obtain dissociation constants. All Kd values are calculated as detailed at www.biochem.emory.edu/Hodel/Research/BindingCurves/fitting_curves.htm. Binding energies were calculated using ΔG = RT ln Kd, where RT =–0.59 kcal/mol. In Vivo Functional Analysis—The in vivo function of each of the importin α variants was tested using a plasmid shuffle technique (30Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding each of the importin α mutant proteins were individually transformed into SRP1 deletion cells (ACY324) containing the URA3 SRP1 maintenance plasmid, pAC876 (23Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Single transformants were grown in liquid culture to saturation, serially diluted (1:10), and spotted on minimal medium plates lacking leucine as a control or on fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates. The drug 5-FOA eliminates the URA3 plasmid-encoded wild-type importin α (pAC876) (30Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Plates were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 3–5 days. Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblot analysis was performed by standard methods as described (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures were grown to log phase in appropriate media at 30 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice in water and once in PBSMT (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.0, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 75 mm KOH, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100). Cells were subsequently lysed in PBSMT with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin) by glass bead lysis. Equal amounts of total protein (generally 10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either monoclonal anti-myc antibody (1:2000 dilution; Oncogene) or polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:10,000 dilution) (32Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Microscopy—Direct fluorescence microscopy was used to localize GFP fusion proteins in live cells. For all experiments, cells were stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml) to visualize the DNA and confirm the location of the nucleus. The localization of the fusion proteins was monitored by directly viewing the GFP signal in living cells through a GFP-optimized filter (Chroma Technology) using an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics Quantix digital camera. Integration into the Yeast Genome—The importin α-GFP mutants were integrated at the endogenous importin α locus of wild-type (ACY192) cells using a standard integration strategy (23Harreman M.T. Hodel M.R. Fanara P. Hodel A.E. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5854-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The integration created a duplication at the endogenous importin α locus such that both endogenous importin α and importin α-GFP were each expressed from SRP1 promoters. TUB1-GFP was integrated at the URA locus as described previously (33Straight A.F. Murray A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast to the importin α-GFP integrations, the A55-importin α mutant replaced the wild-type copy of importin α. To integrate A55-importin α, the A55 mutation was subcloned into the SRP1 open reading frame cloned in the LEU2 integrating plasmid, pRS305 (34Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to create srp1–55-pRS305 (pAC1128). A55-importin α was then integrated at the endogenous SRP1 locus by linearization of srp1–55-pRS305 and transformation into the wild-type diploid ACY247. Transformants that grew on plates lacking leucine were selected, and the presence of the A55-importin α mutation was confirmed by PCR and sequencing. The heterozygous diploid was subsequently sporulated, and tetrads were dissected to generate the haploid A55-importin α strain, srp1–55 (ACY642). This integration strategy is designed to make A55-importin α the only copy of importin α expressed in the haploid strain. Yeast Genetic Analyses—Synthetic interactions between A55-importin α (srp1–55) and other nuclear transport factors were tested by creating double and triple mutant strains. These strains were made by crossing the various haploid mutant strains (srp1–55, cse1–1 (35Xiao Z. McGrew J.T. Schroeder A.J. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Δnup2 (Research Genetics)). The srp1–55 strain was covered by a SRP1 URA3 plasmid (pAC876) and mated to each of the mutants to be tested. The resultant heterozygous diploids were sporulated and dissected to generate the appropriate double and triple mutant haploid strains. For suppression analysis, high copy plasmids (2μ) expressing various nuclear transport factors were transformed into srp1–55 (ACY642) covered by a SRP1 URA3 plasmid (pAC876). Genetic interactions (synthetic growth defects/lethality and suppression) were assessed by growing single colonies in liquid culture to saturation, serially diluting (1:10) and spotting on minimal medium plates as a control or on 5-FOA plates. Plates were incubated at the indicated temperatures for 3–6 days. FACS Analysis—Cells were prepared for FACS analysis by staining with propidium iodide (36Epstein C.B. Cross F.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1695-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were ethanol-fixed at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0. Cells were then treated with 0.08 mg/ml RNase A for1hat50 °C, followed by 0.25 mg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 50 °C, before incubation in 8 μg/ml propidium iodide. Each sample was analyzed with a FACScalibur cytometer. Generation of Mutant Importin α Proteins—Previous analyses of the N-terminal domain of importin α protein revealed a conserved cluster of basic amino acids that serves as an autoinhibitory sequence (mouse importin α residues 49KRR51 corresponding to yeast importin α residues 54KRR56) (22Kobe B.

Here, we showed that human myosin III has an ATPase activity that is significantly activated by actin (20-fold) with Kactin of 112 μm and Vmax of 0.34 s–1, indicating the mechanoenzymatic activity of myosin III. Furthermore, we found that human myosin III has actin translocating activity (0.11 ± 0.05 μm/s) using an in vitro actin gliding assay, and it moves toward the plus end of actin filaments. Myosin III containing calmodulin as the light chain subunit showed a protein kinase activity and underwent autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation was the intramolecular process, and the sites were at the C-terminal end of the motor domain. Autophosphorylation significantly activated the kinase activity, although it did not affect the ATPase activity.

Autophosphorylation significantly activated the kinase activity, although it did not affect the ATPase activity. The present study is the first report that clearly demonstrates that the class III myosin is an actin-based motor protein having a protein kinase activity. Myosin III is a member of the myosin superfamily, which consists of at least 18 classes (1Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 2Hodge T. Cope M.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3353-3354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S.

The class III myosin represents the most divergent member of the myosin superfamily. The motor domain of myosin III shows ∼24–27% sequence identity to myosin Is and ∼22–26% sequence identity to myosin-IIs (6Cheney R.E. Riley M.A. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 24: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that myosin III has an amino terminus domain that resembles to protein kinases. This domain contains the characteristic motifs for protein kinases such as a glycine-rich loop, an invariable Lys residue required for ATP binding, and a catalytic loop. Given its high degree of divergence, if myosin III evolved at the same rate as other myosins, the myosin III lineage would predate the divergence of yeast. Class III myosin was originally found in Drosophila photoreceptor cells and subsequently found in vertebrates including human myosin III (7Battelle B.A. Andrews A.W. Calman B.G. Sellers J.R. Greenberg R.M. Smith W.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4548-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2000; 67: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The function of Myosin III is best studied in Drosophila photoreceptor cells. Each photoreceptor cell has a specialized organelle consisting of a stack of microvilli known as a rhabdomere. The phototransduction machinery is localized in the rhabdomere (9Tomlinson A. Development. 1988; 104: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). Drosophila photoreceptors undergo a prolonged depolarization afterpotential that persists after cessation of the light stimulus. Prolonged depolarization afterpotential results from the stable conversion of rhodopsin to the light-activated form, metarhodopsin, in response to blue light. During a prolonged depolarization afterpotential, photoreceptor cells become refractory to subsequent prolonged depolarization afterpotential-inducing stimuli and are inactivated. Mutants that are defective for both inactivation and the prolonged depolarization afterpotential are known as neither inactivation nor afterpotential (nina) mutants (10Pak W.L. Pinto L.H. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1976; 5: 397-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 11Pak W.L. Breakfield X.O. Neurogenetics: Genetic Approaches to the Nervous System. Elsevier, New York1979: 67-99Google Scholar), and the myosin III was identified (12Montell C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) as one of eight nina complementation groups (ninaA–H) that affect a different gene involved in rhodopsin synthesis, ninaC, on the basis of an electroretinogram phenotype, which could be attributed to reduction in the visual pigment rhodopsin (13Stephenson R.S. O'Tousa J. Scavarda N.J. Randall L.L. Pak W.L. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1983; 36: 477-501PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the ninaC gene product contains the critical conserved motifs for protein kinases at the amino terminus and myosin motor domain at the C-terminal side of the kinase domain, respectively. There are two spliced variants that were reported, p132 and p174 (12Montell C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The p132 protein was primarily localized to the cytoplasm adjacent to the rhabdomeres, and the p174 protein was restricted to the rhabdomeres (14Hicks J.L. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar, 15Porter J.A. Hicks J.L. Williams D.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other than having different subcellular localization, the two ninaC isoforms also exhibit differences in their function. Mutants expressing only the p174 isoform showed little or no effect and displayed the normal phenotype; however, elimination of p174 resulted in a ninaC phenotype as strong as the null allele (15Porter J.A. Hicks J.L. Williams D.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tail unique to p174 is responsible for localization of p174 to the rhabdomeres. Only p174 is required for wild-type electrophysiology and to prevent retinal degeneration. However, it is not known whether the electroretinogram phenotype and retinal degeneration are obligatorily coupled. Analysis of mutants with mutations in the kinase homologous domain demonstrated that the ninaC kinase domain is required for normal electroretinogram, suggesting that the ninaC kinase domain may be required for phototransduction. Mutants that have the entire myosin homologous domain deleted displayed a phenotype that is indistinguishable from the null mutant, suggesting that the myosin homologous domain is required for normal phototransduction and to prevent retinal degeneration (16Porter J.A. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization performed on the kinase domain- and myosin domain-deleted mutants shows that the kinase domain is not required for localization of p174 to the rhabdomeres, but myosin domain-deleted mutants no longer specifically localize to the rhabdomeres and were also detected in the cell body, suggesting that the myosin domain is required to concentrate p174 in the rhabdomeres (16Porter J.A. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 601-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The Drosophila ninaC proteins have also been demonstrated to bind calmodulin (17Porter J.A. Yu M. Doberstein S.K. Pollard T.D. Montell C. Science. 1993; 262: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The calmodulin localization seems to be dependent on the ninaC proteins, since the mutant flies lacking the p174 protein did not concentrate calmodulin in the rhabdomeres, and mutant flies lacking p132 did not show any detectable amount of calmodulin in the cytoplasm. A defect in vision was also detected when calmodulin was not concentrated in the rhabdomeres, suggesting a role for calmodulin in phototransduction. Recently, it was shown that the ninaC protein directly binds to the PDZ domain protein INAD that is thought to play a role in assembling the phototransduction signaling complex (18Wes P.D. Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Chien F. Doberstein S.K. Montell C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas INAD mutants failed to change ninaC localization, disruption of the ninaC/INAD interaction delayed termination of the photoreceptor response, suggesting the role of the complex in rapid deactivation of the photoresponse. These findings have suggested that myosin III plays a significant role in the phototransduction process. Of interest are the recent findings of the involvement of the myosin III gene in human hereditary disorders. Dose and Burnside (19Dose A.C. Burnside B. Genomics. 2002; 79: 621-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that MYO3B maps a region that overlaps the locus for a Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Walsh et al. (20Walsh T. Walsh V. Vreugde S. Hertzano R. Shahin H. Haika S. Lee M.K. Kanaan M. King M.C. Avraham K.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7518-7523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) also reported that MYO3A is responsible for nonsyndromic recessive progressive hearing loss, DFNB30. However, a key problem is that whereas the class III myosin contains the domain homologous to the motor domain of the other myosin superfamily, there is no hard evidence that the class III myosin is actually the motor protein. Because the sequence homology of myosin III at the “myosin” domain is low among the myosin superfamily members, it has been suggested that myosin III may not be a motor protein but rather a signaling molecule. The objective of this research is to clarify whether myosin III is an actin-based motor protein. In the present paper, we show for the first time that human myosin III has an actin-activated ATPase activity and an actin translocating activity, clearly indicating that myosin III is an actin-based motor molecule with protein kinase function. Materials—Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (21Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle myosin S1 fragment was prepared as described previously (22Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S. Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Generation of the Human Myosin IIIA Construct—Total RNA was prepared from human retinal pigment epithelia cell line ARPE-19 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated using an Oligotex mRNA minikit (Qiagen). Myosin IIIA cDNA was generated by reverse transcription (Superscript reverse transcriptase II; Invitrogen) with specific primers. The cDNAs (nucleotides 1–2200 and 2026–3873) were amplified using sense primer 5′-GCTAGCTTGGCGTCTGAGCATTCTTATGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTCGACTGCTCAGCTCATCACCATTC-3′ and using sense primer 5′-GCTAGCTGGTCACTAGAGGAGAAAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTCGACCTGGGTAGCTTGGCCTTTCTG-3′, respectively. The amplified cDNAs were digested with NheI/NcoI and NcoI/SalI, respectively. The digested cDNAs were ligated into pFast-Bac1 baculovirus transfer vector (Invitrogen), containing c-myc and an octahistidine tag. This construct (huM3AIQ2) contains the kinase domain, motor domain, neck domain containing two IQ motifs, and short tail domain with a c-myc tag and an octahistidine tag at the C-terminal end. The recombinant baculovirus expressing huM3AIQ2 protein was produced according to the manufacturer's protocol. Expression and Purification of huM3AIQ2 Protein—To express recombinant huM3AIQ2 protein, 200 ml of sf9 cells (about 1 × 109 cells) were co-infected with two viruses expressing huM3AIQ2 and calmodulin. The infected cells were cultured for 3 days at 28 °C. The cells were lysed with sonication in 40 ml of lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm KCl, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.1 mm TPCK, 1The abbreviations used are: TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone. 0.1 mm TLCK). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was mixed with 1.0 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acidagarose (Qiagen) in a 50-ml conical tube on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin suspension was washed with 50 ml of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0), 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 0.01 mm TPCK, 0.01 mm TLCK. huM3AIQ2 was eluted with buffer containing 150 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing huM3AIQ2 were pooled and dialyzed against 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The purified huM3AIQ2 was stored on ice and used within 2 days. Typically, 0.5 mg of isolated huM3AIQ2 was obtained. Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 7.5–20% polyacrylamide gel using the discontinuous buffer system of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). Gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. For immunoblot analysis, samples were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) after SDS-PAGE. Anti-c-myc or anti-hexahistidine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used as primary antibodies. Signals were detected with Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Protein Kinase Assay—The protein kinase assay was done in 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μm microcystin LR, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) at 25 °C. The reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and protein bands in the gels were excised. The radioactivity was counted by a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500, Fullerton, CA). Phosphoamino acid analysis was done as described previously (24Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase Assay—The actin-activated ATPase activity was measured in 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol with or without F-actin at 25 °C. All assays were initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP to the reaction mixture. The liberated 32P was measured as described previously (25Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 13146-13153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase activity was also measured in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5 mm phosphoenol pyruvate). The liberated pyruvate was determined as described (26Reynard A.M. Hass L.E. Jacobson D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin Co-sedimentation Assay—The huM3AIQ2 was incubated in buffer containing 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μm F-actin at 25 °C for 10 min. The sample was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min, and then the supernatant and the pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The amount of the co-sedimented huM3AIQ2 heavy chain was determined by densitometry as described previously (27Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—huM3AIQ2 was dialyzed against a solution containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EGTA and then applied to a Sephacryl S-300HR column (1.0 × 46 cm). The protein was eluted with a dialyzed buffer at a flow rate of 0.16 ml/min. Fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-hexahistidine antibodies as described above. Kav was calculated using the equation,Kav=(Ve−Vo)/(Vt−Vo) where Ve, Vo, and Vt are the elution volume, the void volume, and the total volume, respectively. In Vitro Motility Assay—The actin gliding velocity was measured by in vitro actin gliding assay. A coverslip was first coated with nitrocellulose and huM3AIQ2 was then applied to the coverslip. The movement of actin filaments was observed in 25 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 18 μg/ml catalase, 0.1 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 3.0 mg/ml glucose, 4 mm ATP, and 0.5% methylcellulose at 25 °C. Glucose oxidase and catalase were added in the assay solution to reduce the fluorescence quenching as described previously (28Kron S.J. Toyoshima Y.Y. Uyeda T.Q. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Dual labeled F-actin was prepared by the method of Homma et al. (29Homma K. Yoshimura M. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Nature. 2001; 412: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Actin filament velocity was calculated from the movement distance and the elapsed time in successive snapshots. Student's t test was used for statistical comparison of mean values. A value of p < 0.01 was considered to be significant. Expression and Isolation of the Recombinant Human Myosin III—The human myosin III construct was produced (see “Experimental Procedures”) and expressed in sf9 insect cells. The construct (huM3AIQ2) contains the entire kinase domain, the myosin homology domain, and the two IQ domains with C-terminal histidine tag and c-myc tag to aid in purification (Fig. 1A). The histidine tagging at the C-terminal end of the molecule has been performed with conventional (30Li X.D. Saito J. Ikebe R. Mabuchi K. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2254-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as well as unconventional myosin (31Homma K. Saito J. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34766-34771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 32Yoshimura M. Homma K. Saito J. Inoue A. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39600-39607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and no influence on motor function has been observed. The cells were co-infected with an appropriate ratio of human myosin III-expressing virus and calmodulin-expressing virus, since it was reported that calmodulin copurified with myosin III heavy chain (33Porter J.A. Minke B. Montell C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4450-4459Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), suggesting that calmodulin plays a role as the light chain subunits. Fig. 1B shows SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purification steps of huM3AIQ2. The purified huM3AIQ2 construct was composed of a high molecular mass band and a low molecular mass band free from 200-kDa sf9 conventional myosin and actin. The high molecular mass band (150 kDa) was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of huM3AIQ2 and was recognized by anti-myc antibodies (data not shown) (Fig. 1B), indicating that the high molecular mass band is the expressed myosin III heavy chain. The small subunits showed a mobility shift with a change in Ca2+ that is characteristic of calmodulin, suggesting that the small subunit is indeed calmodulin (Fig. 1B). To examine whether myosin III has one-headed or two-headed structure, the purified myosin III was subjected to gel filtration chromatography analysis using Sephacryl S-300HR (Fig. 2). The molecular mass of the purified huM3AIQ2 was estimated to be 172 kDa based upon the standard curve with known molecular mass standard proteins. The value was consistent with the calculated molecular mass of the construct with two bound calmodulins of the single-headed form (183,926 Da). Protein Kinase Activity of Human Myosin III and Its Autophosphorylation—The protein kinase activity of the purified human myosin III was examined. Among the protein substrates tested, human myosin III phosphorylated myosin regulatory light chain, calponin, actin, and myelin basic protein (Fig. 3A). The result clearly demonstrated that it has protein kinase activity. It should be mentioned that the phosphorylation of these substrate proteins was not observed without adding myosin III, indicating that the phosphorylation is catalyzed by myosin III but not contaminated kinases in the substrate protein samples. The best substrate among the substrates tested was myelin basic protein, and the observed rates in the assay conditions were 0.27 nmol/min/mg, 0.13 nmol/min/mg, 0.016 nmol/min/mg, and 9.3 × 10–4 nmol/min/mg, for myelin basic protein, calponin, myosin II regulatory light chain, and actin, respectively. Of interest is that human myosin III also showed the autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 3B, a) and the maximum extent of phosphorylation of 1.8 mol of Pi/mol was obtained (Fig. 3B, b). Similar autophosphorylation activity was observed with the construct containing the third IQ motif (Met1–Lys1408) (not shown). The result suggests that there are at least two autophosphorylation sites in the huM3AIQ2 construct. The phosphoamino acid analysis of the autophosphorylated myosin III revealed that both serine and threonine are phosphorylated, although threonine phosphorylation was predominant (Fig. 3B, c). To detect tyrosine phosphorylation, thin layer electrophoresis was also performed at higher pH, where phosphotyrosine is well separated from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine (34Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). There was no phosphotyrosine detected (not shown). To examine whether the autophosphorylation is the intermolecular process or intramolecular process, the rate of autophosphorylation was examined as a function of huM3AIQ2 concentration. The rate of autophosphorylation was constant regardless of myosin III concentration (Fig. 3B, d). The result suggests that the autophosphorylation is an intramolecular process rather than intermolecular reaction. The result further indicates that the phosphorylation is not due to the potentially contaminated kinases, because if so, the rate of myosin III heavy chain phosphorylation increases with the increase in myosin III concentration in the reaction mixture. We studied whether autophosphorylation affects the protein kinase activity of myosin III. huM3AIQ2 was preincubated with cold ATP to complete autophosphorylation, and then [γ-32P]ATP and the protein substrate were added simultaneously, and the incorporation of 32P into the substrate was monitored by autoradiography at various times (Fig. 4A). The result clearly indicated that the autophosphorylation significantly activated the protein kinase activity of myosin III. The radioactivity of the phosphorylated substrate was quantitatively analyzed by using a phosphor imager (Fujifilm FLA-5000). The result indicates that the autophosphorylation activated the kinase activity 3.3-fold (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4Effect of autophosphorylation of myosin III on its kinase activity. 20 μg/ml huM3AIQ2 was incubated in the presence or absence of 0.2 mm ATP for 90 min as described under “Experimental Procedures,” to complete autophosphorylation of myosin III, and then 0.1 mg/ml MBP and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP were added to the reaction mixture. The specific radioactivity was adjusted for the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by phosphorylated and unphosphorylated myosin III. The reaction mixture was incubated for a time as indicated and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The rate of phosphorylation was determined using an FLA-5000 phosphor imager (Fujifilm). A, autoradiogram. B, time course of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein determined by the phosphor imager. Open circles, phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by autophosphorylated huM3AIQ2; closed circles, phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by nonautophosphorylated huM3AIQ2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further determine the domain of myosin III autophosphorylation, the autophosphorylated huM3AIQ2 was subjected to limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin (Fig. 5). The proteolysis first produced the phosphorylated peptide of 32 kDa, which was further digested to 24-kDa and then 20-kDa peptide. The autoradiography suggests that all of the phosphorylation sites are retained in the 20-kDa peptide. To determine the location of the 20-kDa domain in human myosin III, we determined the N-terminal sequence of the 20-kDa peptide. The peptide had a free N terminus, and the sequence was Ile-Asn-Leu-Ala-Lys. This sequence corresponds to Ile901–Lys905 in human myosin III sequence, thus indicating that the 20-kDa peptide is the C-terminal end of the motor domain. Actin-activated ATPase Activity—Whereas the class III myosin contains the myosin head homology domain, it is less conserved than other myosin superfamily members, and one of the most critical questions for myosin III is whether myosin III is an actin-based motor protein. To address this question, we examined the actin-activated ATPase activity of the purified human myosin III. We found that human myosin III exhibited the Mg2+-ATPase activity that was significantly activated by actin. Fig. 6 shows the actin-activated ATPase activity as a function of actin concentration. The actin concentration required for the saturation of the activation was significantly higher than that of myosin V (35Trybus K.M. Krementsova E. Freyzon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27448-27456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 36De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13726-13731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) but comparable with that of conventional myosin, and Kactin of 112 μm and Vmax of 0.34 s–1 were obtained in 25 mM KCl at 25 °C (Fig. 6). It should be noted that the autophosphorylation did not significantly affect the actin-activated ATPase activity (not shown). Fig. 7 shows the actin-activated ATPase activity of huM3AIQ2 as a function of ATP concentration in the presence of the ATP regeneration system. A solid line is the calculated line based upon the equation V = Vmax[ATP]/(KATP + [ATP]). According to the analysis, Vmax and KATP were estimated to be 0.11 s–1 and 6.2 μM, respectively. Whereas we measured the ATPase activity of huM3AIQ2, we found that the rate of Pi liberation significantly decreased with time (Fig. 8). Approximately 50 μm ATP of the initial 200 μm ATP was consumed at 120 min. Because KATP was 6.2 μm, it is unlikely that the decrease in the activity is due to the depletion of ATP. This time-dependent inhibition of the Pi liberation was abolished when the ATP regeneration system was included in the reaction mixture (Fig. 8). In contrast, the time-dependent inhibition of the ATPase activity was not observed for skeletal S1 sub-fragment (Fig. 8, inset). Similar time-dependent inhibition of the ATPase activity has been reported for myosin V. The result suggested that ADP produced during the ATPase reaction inhibits the ATPase activity, presumably due to relatively high affinity for ADP. Based upon the equation, d[ADP]/dt = Vmax[ATP]/(KATP(1 + [ADP]/KADP) + [ATP]), and KATP = 6.2 μm, KADP was estimated from the initial phase of the fitting curve to be 1.5 μm. To further confirm this notion, the effect of ADP on the actin-activated ATPase activity of huM3AIQ2 was examined (Fig. 9). The addition of ADP to the reaction mixture significantly inhibited the actin-activated ATPase activity of huM3AIQ2 (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the activity of the skeletal S1 fragment was not inhibited (Fig. 9, inset). Based upon the equation, V = Vmax[ATP]/KATP(1 + [ADP]/KADP) + [ATP], KADP was calculated to be 8.5 μm. These results suggest the strong ADP binding of human myosin III.Fig. 8Time course of the actin-activated ATPase activity of huM3AIQ2 with and without the ATP-regenerating system. ATPase activity was measured in the presence (open circles) and absence (closed circles) of 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase using 40 μm actin. Other assay conditions are as described in the legend for Fig. 6. Approximately 50 μm ATP was consumed at 120 min. The inset shows that the"

We demonstrated previously that lactoferrin (Lf) specifically binds to WI-38 human fibroblasts and enhances their collagen gel contractile activity. The effect of Lf correlated with the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC), suggesting that Lf promotes fibroblast contractile activity by regulating MLC phosphorylation. We found here that the binding of Lf to WI-38 cells was inhibited by recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP), a universal competitor for ligand binding to LRP (LDL receptor-related protein), and RAP can also promote the collagen gel contractile activity. These observations suggest that LRP is a receptor that mediates the Lf-induced enhancement of collagen gel contractile activity in WI-38 fibroblasts. To confirm the hypothesis, we utilized LRP antisense oligonucleotide, which was modified by morpholino linkage. Suppression of LRP expression abrogated the Lf-induced enhancement the contractile activity in fibroblasts. Treatment of fibroblasts with Lf enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and the activation of MLC kinase (MLCK). These effects were attenuated by suppression of LRP expression. These findings suggest that LRP is involved in the Lf-enhanced collagen gel contractile activity of WI-38 fibroblasts by converting the Lf binding signal into the activation of ERK1/2 and MLCK.

Fibroblasts cultured in a three-dimensional type I collagen gel are able to reorganize the surrounding collagen gel matrix into a more dense and compact structure. This phenomenon is called collagen gel contraction and is considered to mimic the reorganization of the collagen matrix that accompanies wound healing and pathological tissue contracture (1Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Collagen gel contraction is due to the tractional force exerted by fibroblasts. It involves numerous actions, including cell adhesion to the collagen fibers, cell migration through the collagen matrix. The extent of collagen gel contraction appears to reflect the motility of the cells in the collagen gel. Certain cytokines (e.g. lysophosphatidic acid) and growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Lf, lactoferrin; bLf, bovine lactoferrin; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium; RAP, receptor-associated protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; apoE, apolipoprotein E; RT, reverse transcriptase; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine.1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; Lf, lactoferrin; bLf, bovine lactoferrin; LRP, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's minimal essential medium; RAP, receptor-associated protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; uPA, urokinase-type plasminogen activator; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; apoE, apolipoprotein E; RT, reverse transcriptase; TMB, tetramethylbenzidine. and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), are known to promote the collagen gel contraction mediated by fibroblasts (2Grinnell F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 362-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been found that collagen gel contractile activity and fibroblast motility is regulated by myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation (3Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Jay P.Y. Pham P.A. Wong S.A. Elson E.L. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 387-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that lactoferrin (Lf) is another factor that is able to promote the collagen gel contractile activity and MLC phosphorylation in WI-38 human fibroblasts (5Takayama Y. Mizumachi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Lf is an iron-binding glycoprotein belonging to the transferrin family. It is synthesized by neutrophils and glandular epithelial cells and is found in many mammalian secretions, including milk, colostrum, semen, tears, and saliva. It is believed that Lf acts as a defense in host animals against microbes and viruses, since it has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antiviral activities (6Nuijens J.H. van Berkel P.H. Schanbacher F.L. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It also appears to be involved in the inflammatory and immune response against tumors (7Baynes R.D. Bezwoda W.R. Khan Q. Mansoor N. Scand. J. Haematol. 1986; 36: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several studies indicate that Lf is able to modulate various biological functions of mammalian cells. For example, it promotes the activation of natural killer (NK) cells (8Shau H. Kim A. Golub S.H. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1992; 51: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and neutrophils (9Oh S.M. Hahm D.H. Kim I.H. Choi S.Y. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1875-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the maturation of T and B lymphocytes (11Zimecki M. Mazurier J. Machnicki M. Wieczorek Z. Montreuil J. Spik G.

It also inhibits osteoclast-resorbing activity (13Lorget F. Clough J. Oliveira M. Daury M.C. Sabokbar A. Offord E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and platelet aggregation (14Leveugle B. Mazurier J. Legrand D. Mazurier C. Montreuil J. Spik G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1205-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Each of these Lf-mediated activities seems to be due to the ability of this molecule to modulate cellular signaling events by interacting with target cells. The cell surface receptors for Lf on various types of mammalian cells have been isolated and characterized, including LRP (LDL receptor-related protein) (15Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored Lf-binding protein (16Suzuki Y.A. Shin K. Lonnerdal B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15771-15779Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), and CD14 (17Baveye S. Elass E. Fernig D.G. Blanquart C. Mazurier J. Legrand D. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 6519-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate the cellular responses to Lf ligand binding are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the Lf receptor that participates in the Lf-induced enhancement of the collagen gel contractile activity in fibroblasts. We hypothesized that LRP mediates the signal transduction pathway that converts the Lf binding signal into the collagen gel contractile activity in the fibroblasts. It has been reported that Lf can interact with the extracellular domain of LRP (15Willnow T.E. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Brown M.S. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26172-26180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the removal of Lf from plasma (18Meilinger M. Haumer M. Szakmary K.A. Steinbock F. Scheiber B. Goldenberg H. Huettinger M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and translocation of Lf across the blood brain barrier (19Fillebeen C. Descamps L. Dehouck M.P. Fenart L. Benaissa M. Spik G. Cecchelli R. Pierce A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7011-7017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) is mediated by LRP. LRP is a membrane glycoprotein that is a member of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. LRP is abundantly expressed on hepatocytes, neurons, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts and consists of an extracellular 515-kDa heavy chain and 85-kDa light chain that span the membrane. The extracellular domain of LRP contains four ligand-binding clusters denoted I to IV. Similar to other members in the LDL receptor family, LRP is known as an endocytotic receptor and participates in the uptake of lipoproteins containing triglyceride and cholesterol by hepatocytes. However, the broad range of its ligand diversity and lethality of LRP conventional knockout mice suggests that LRP is involved in diverse physiological and pathological processes other than just lipoprotein metabolism. These processes may include cell migration, fibrinolysis, thrombosis, and atheroscleosis, in addition to lipoprotein metabolism (20Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the binding of various ligands (e.g. urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), apolipoprotein E (apoE), and α-defensin) to LRP regulates the migration in cultured cells and the contraction of smooth muscle cell (21Okada S.S.

However, the underlying biochemical signaling pathways elicited by LRP-ligand interaction remain to be elucidated. To address the above hypothesis, we investigated the effect of the LRP antisense oligonucleotide on the collagen gel contractile activity in WI-38 human fibroblasts. We found that suppression of LRP expression in this way abrogated the Lfenhanced augmentation of the collagen gel contractile activity and that the Lf-enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MLC plays a critical role in the process. Cell Culture—WI-38 human fetal fibroblasts were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere. Materials—Materials and chemicals were obtained as follows: purified bovine Lf (bLf) from Nippon Protein (Tokyo, Japan); type I collagen solution from Nitta Gelatin (Osaka, Japan); anti-MLC monoclonal antibody, anti-MLCK monoclonal antibody, MLCK substrate peptide (AKRPQRATSNVPS), and calmodulin from Sigma; anti-ERK1 monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); anti-phospho-p42/44 ERK/MAP kinase monoclonal antibody, anti-p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody, and anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase polyclonal antibody from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA); anti-human urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) monoclonal antibody from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); Pansorbin cells from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA); anti-LRP (515 kDa) monoclonal antibody, and recombinant receptor-associated protein (RAP) from Progen (Heidelberg, Germany); PD98059 from Wako (Osaka, Japan); HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated streptavidin, and tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate reagent from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA); Morpholinoderivatized LRP antisense and control oligonucleotides from Gene Tools (Philomath, OR); LRP PCR primer from Hokkaido System Science (Sapporo, Japan); TaqDNA polymerase (Ampli Taq) from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA); human β-actin control primer sets from Stratagene Cloning Systems (La Jolla, CA); ISOGEN total RNA extraction reagent from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan); 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit from Roche Applied Science. A monoclonal antibody against the phosphorylated serine 19 of MLC was a gift from Dr. Minoru Seto (Asahi Chemical Industry, Shizuoka, Japan). Polyclonal rabbit antisera against the cytoplasmic domain of LRP was a gift from Prof. Joachim Herz (University of Texas, Dallas, TX). Biotinylation of Lf and Cell Surface Binding Assay—Biotinylation of bLf and the detection of Lf binding to WI-38 fibroblasts was performed according to the method described by Rejman et al. (27Rejman J.J. Turner J.D. Oliver S.P. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, WI-38 fibroblasts were plated onto collagen-coated 96-well tissue culture plates (2 × 104 cells/well) and incubated with biotinylated Lf for 4 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled Lf. The cells were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated avidin for 1 h at room temperature. The biotin-avidin complex was detected with the TMB substrate reagent. The reaction was terminated with 0.18 n H2SO4, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an automated plate reader. LRP Antisense Oligonucleotide Transfection—The antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CAGCATGGTGTGGGCTGATGCAAGC-3′, which corresponds to nucleotides 458–572 of human LRP, was utilized to repress LRP expression in WI-38 fibroblasts. The oligonucleotide was modified by a morpholino linkage to increase its solubility and to provide highly specific antisense activity in transfected cells (28Morcos P.A. Genetics. 2001; 30: 94-102Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide corresponding to the inverted sequence of the LRP antisense oligonucleotide was used as a negative control. WI-38 fibroblasts were transfected with the oligonucleotides by a 3-h incubation in DMEM containing 1.5 μm morpholino oligonucleotide and an equal volume of ethoxylated polyethylenimine (EPEI) transfection reagent. The cells were subsequently cultured for 5 days in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS and harvested by treatment with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% trypsin and EDTA. Reverse Transcription and PCR of LRP mRNA—Total RNA was isolated from WI-38 fibroblasts by the guanidine thiocyanate/phenol-chloroform extraction method with the ISOGEN total RNA extraction reagent. Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed by a 1st strand cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PCR primers were designed based on the published human LRP gene sequence: LRP forward primer, 5′-GTATCTCAAAGGGCTGGCGGTG-3′; LRP reverse primer 5′-TGCACCCAGCATTCGGTCTC-3′. The PCR reaction was performed using the cDNA with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The size and the amount of the PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. Collagen Gel Contraction Assay—A type I collagen solution (3 mg/ml) was gently mixed with 5-fold concentrated cold DMEM on ice. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.4 with 200 mm HEPES containing 2.2% Na2HCO. The final concentration of collagen was adjusted to 1.5 mg/ml by chilled distilled water. A collagen gel was prepared by pouring 0.4 ml of the mixture into each well of a 24-well culture plate and allowing the mixture to settle for 2 h at 37 °C. The fibroblasts suspended in 0.4 ml of serum-free DMEM were plated on the top of each collagen gel at an initial cell density of 8 × 104 cells/ml. Gel contraction was initiated by detaching the edge of the collagen gel from the well. The morphological changes of each collagen gel were observed by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, and the area of each collagen gel was measured by NIH Image software. Western Blotting—WI-38 cells were washed twice with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and aliquots of the supernatants containing 10 μg of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a Laemmli system and electrically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). In the case of the detection of phosphorylated and total MLC, the proteins were transferred onto an Immobilon-PSQ membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Subsequently, the membrane was treated with a blocking reagent (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) for 2 h at room temperature. The blocked membrane was probed with primary antibodies and further incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated with HRP. The immunoreactivity was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescense system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of MLCK—The cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of a 10% Pansorbin suspension for 30 min at 4 °C. The Pansorbin cells were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with the anti-MLCK antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, 0.1 μg of anti-mouse IgG was added, and the complexes were further incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were precipitated from the lysates by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of a 10% Pansorbin cell suspension, followed by first washing with a cushion of 500 μl of TNE buffer containing 1 m sucrose and washing twice with TNE buffer. The immunocomplexes obtained were resuspended in 20 μl of TNE buffer. In Vitro Kinase Assay—The kinase activity of MLCK was determined by quantifying the amount of radiolabeled phosphate incorporated into the MLCK substrate peptide (AKRPQRATSNVPS). MLCK was immunoprecipitated from the WI-38 cell lysate (containing 500 μg of protein) as described above, and an aliquot of the immunocomplexes was mixed with 18 μl of a ice-cold reaction mixture (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm calmodulin, and 2.4 μm MLCK substrate peptide), and the kinase reaction was initiated by adding 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 30 min at 28 °C, an equal volume of 5% trichloroacetate containing 1% BSA was added to stop the kinase reaction. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was dropped onto P-81 ion-exchange cellulose paper (Whatmann, Maidstone, UK). The cellulose paper was washed twice with 30% acetate and twice with 15% acetate. The radioactivity in the cellulose paper was quantified by scintillation counting. RAP Competes with bLf for Binding to WI-38 Fibroblasts—We previously demonstrated that bLf specifically binds to WI-38 fibroblasts (5Takayama Y. Mizumachi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To determine whether LRP is involved in the specific binding of bLf to WI-38 fibroblasts, we investigated whether RAP could compete with Lf for binding to WI-38 cells. RAP is a high affinity ligand for LRP that is utilized as a universal competitor for LRP ligands (29Bu G. Marzolo M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). WI-38 fibroblasts were incubated with 1 μm biotin-labeled bLf in the presence of increasing concentrations of the RAP (0–4 μm). As shown in Fig. 1, RAP inhibited the binding of biotin-labeled bLf to WI-38 cells, whereas BSA did not affect the binding of bLf to WI-38 fibroblasts. These observations suggest that LRP is involved in the specific binding of bLf to WI-38 fibroblasts. RAP Promotes the Collagen Gel Contractile Activity of Fibroblasts—It has been shown that Lf and RAP both interact with the same extracellular domain of LRP (30Neels J.G. van Den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and that either ligand can compete with the other for binding to LRP (31Vash B. Phung N. Zein S. DeCamp D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3277-3285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that RAP, as well as Lf, could promote the collagen gel contractile activity of WI-38 fibroblasts. We tested this by performing the collagen gel contraction assay and assessing the effect of RAP in 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after initiating gel contraction by observing the morphological changes of the gel by a CCD camera. Recombinant RAP (final concentration 0.5 μm) enhanced the collagen gel contractile activity of the fibroblasts (Fig. 2A) in a dose-dependent manner that was identical to that of bLf (Fig. 2B). These observations reinforce the possibility that LRP participates in the Lf-enhanced collagen gel contractile activity of fibroblasts. Inhibition of LRP Expression by Antisense Oligonucleotide Against LRP—We next assessed whether blocking LRP expression would affect Lf binding to WI-38 fibroblasts. To block LRP expression, WI-38 cells were incubated for 3 h with 1.5 μm LRP antisense oligonucleotide against LRP modified by a morpholino linkage (28Morcos P.A. Genetics. 2001; 30: 94-102Google Scholar). WI-38 fibroblasts were also incubated with 1.5 μm oligonucleotide corresponding to the inverted sequence of the LRP antisense oligonucleotide (control). 5 days later, the expression level of LRP mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR analysis, which revealed that the antisense oligonucleotide reduced the LRP mRNA expression to undetectable levels (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the control oligonucleotide did not affect LRP mRNA expression. Western blotting using antibodies against either the LRP heavy chain (515 kDa) or the LRP light chain (85 kDa) confirmed that LRP protein expression levels in the LRP oligonucleotide-treated cells were significantly suppressed (Fig. 3B). However, neither of the oligonucleotides affected the protein levels of another receptor, uPAR (Fig. 3B). We examined the effect of the LRP antisense oligonucleotide treatment on the specific binding of Lf to WI-38 fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Unexpectedly, the suppression of LRP expression did not inhibit the binding of biotin-labeled Lf to WI-38 fibroblasts. This suggests that LRP is not the initial binding site for Lf on WI-38 fibroblasts, and an alternative Lf-binding molecule is expressed on the surface of WI-38 fibroblasts. LRP Antisense Oligonucleotide Inhibits the Lf-enhanced Collagen Gel Contractile Activity—We investigated the effect of the LRP antisense oligonucleotide on the Lf-enhanced collagen gel contractile activity of WI-38 fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 5, it neutralized the collagen gel contraction promoting activity of Lf. In contrast, the control oligonucleotide did not affect the activity. This observation indicates that LRP is required for Lf-enhanced collagen gel contraction. In the absence of Lf, suppression of LRP expression did not affect the collagen gel contractile activity of the fibroblasts. This suggests that the role of LRP in Lf-enhanced collagen gel contraction is related to the ability of Lf to facilitate the intracellular events that is required for the gel contractile processes. Lf Enhances the Phosphorylation and Activation of ERK1/2 and MLCK in WI-38 Cells—The extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) participates in cell migration and the wound healing process (32Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 33Dieckgraefe B.K. Weems D.M. Santoro S.A Alpers D.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was reported that the collagen gel contraction mediated by fibroblasts is associated with the activation and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (34Lee D.J. Rosenfeldt H. Grinnell F. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 190-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of bLf on the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) in WI-38 fibroblasts. The phosphorylation levels of ERK and p38 MAPK were estimated by Western blotting using antibodies against the phosphorylated residues of these proteins. Administration of bLf (final concentration, 1 μm) enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 within 10 min. The phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 was decreased to baseline levels by 60 min after stimulation. In contrast, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK was not affected by bLf treatment (Fig. 6). We next investigated the effect of bLf on the activity of MLC kinase (MLCK). MLC phosphorylation is a critical step in the formation of actin stress fibers and the modulation of the migratory and collagen gel contractile activities of fibroblasts (32Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 35Parizi M. Howard E.W. Tomasek J.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 210-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). MLCK is known to be a critical regulator of MLC phosphorylation in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts as well as in smooth muscle cells (36Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hartshorne D.J. Sasaki Y. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 797-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that administration of bLf enhanced MLC phosphorylation in WI-38 fibroblasts (5Takayama Y. Mizumachi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Supporting this observation, we found here that the MLCK activity of WI-38 cells was increased by more than 6-fold within 10 min after 1 μm bLf treatment (Fig. 7A). This MLCK activation was sustained in the 60 min after the administration of bLf. It has been reported that the activation of MLCK by mitogen is associated with the increased phosphorylation of MAPK, and that ERK/MAPK is able to phosphorylate (activate) MLCK (32Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that the activation of MLCK by ERK increases MLC phosphorylation, and enhances the COS-7 cell migration or leukocyte phagocytic activity (32Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 37Mansfield P.J. Shayman J.A. Boxer L.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 2407-2412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the link between ERK and MLCK activation in Lfenhanced fibroblast collagen gel contraction, we investigated the effect of the MEK inhibitor (PD98059) on the Lf-enhanced activation of MLCK in WI-38 cells. We exposed WI-38 cells to bLf (1 μm) in the presence or absence of PD98059 and measured the kinase activity of MLCK 10 min later. PD98059 (final concentration 50 μm) prevented the Lf-enhanced activation of MLCK (Fig. 7B), which indicates that ERK participates in the Lf signal transduction pathway in fibroblasts by activating MLCK. We found previously that the MLCK inhibitor (ML-7) and PD98059 both prevented the Lf-enhanced collagen gel contractile activity of human fibroblasts (5Takayama Y. Mizumachi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The observation in this study is consistent with the hypothesis that Lf modulates the collagen gel contractile activity of WI-38 fibroblasts by regulating the ERK- and MLCK-dependent signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2152125584,"Structure analysis of the cytochrome bc1 complex in the presence and absence of Qp quinol analog inhibitors implied that a large amplitude motion of the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) is required to mediate electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c1. Studies of the functional consequences of mutagenesis of an 8-residue ISP “hinge” region in the bc1 complex showed it to be sensitive to structure perturbation, implying that optimum flexibility and length are required for the large amplitude motion. Mutagenesis-function analysis carried out on the ISP hinge region of the cytochrome b6f complex using the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 showed the following. (i) Of three petC genes, only that in the petCA operon codes for functional ISP. (ii) The function of the complex was insensitive to changes in the hinge region that increased flexibility, decreased flexibility by substitutions of 4–6 Pro residues, shortened the hinge by a 1-residue deletion, or elongated it by insertion of 4 residues. The latter change increased sensitivity to Qp inhibitors, whereas deletion of 2 residues resulted in a loss of inhibitor sensitivity and a decrease in activity, indicating a minimum hinge length of 7 residues required for optimum binding of ISP at the Qp site. Thus, in contrast to the bc1 complex, the function of the b6f complex was insensitive to sequence changes in the ISP hinge that altered its length or flexibility. This implies that either the barriers to motion or the amplitude of ISP motion required for function is smaller than in the bc1 complex.

The cytochrome b6f complex functions as a plastoquinol: plastocyanin/cytochrome c6 oxidoreductase in oxygenic photosynthesis and is shared by both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transfer pathways in cyanobacteria (1Kallas T. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 259-317Google Scholar). It mediates electron transfer from photosystem II to photosystem I in the linear electron transfer pathway or around photosystem I in a cyclic pathway, generating an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane that is used for the synthesis of ATP (2Soriano G.M.

The b6f complex is phylogenetically analogous to the cytochrome bc1 complex of mitochondria and photosynthetic bacteria. It is an integral membrane protein complex composed of eight to nine polypeptide subunits (3Zhang H. Whitelegge J.P. Cramer W.A. J. Biol.

The 24-kDa cytochrome b6 subunit, which has four transmembrane α-helices and contains two b-type hemes, together with the 17-kDa subunit IV, which has three transmembrane helices, are homologous to the N- and C-terminal segments of the cytochrome b in the bc1 complex (5Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The 19-kDa Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 1The abbreviations used are: ISP, iron-sulfur protein; DBMIB, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone. consisting of an N-terminal single transmembrane α-helix domain and a 140-residue soluble extrinsic domain with a linker region connecting these two domains, has an overall function similar to that of the ISP in the bc1 complex, deprotonating the membrane-bound quinol and transferring electrons from the quinol to the membrane-bound c-type cytochrome (6Link T.A.

Of the two subdomains of the ISP extrinsic domain, the cluster-binding small subdomain involved in formation of the Qp site (the quinone-binding site on the electrochemically positive side of the b6f/bc1 complex) is structurally identical in the two complexes, whereas the large subdomain, which is directly connected to the linker region, has a different fold (9Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure of the membrane-bound c-type cytochrome is completely different in the two complexes. The 31-kDa c-type cytochrome f subunit is functionally related to, but structurally completely different from, the cytochrome c1 in the bc1 complex (10Martinez S.E. Huang D. Ponomarev M. Cramer W.A.

The structure differences, as well as the similarities, between these two complexes are important for understanding the mechanism of the ISP in the b6f complex (see below). High resolution x-ray diffraction analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complexes in the presence/absence of the Qp site inhibitor stigmatellin suggested an intracomplex electron shuttle function for the ISP subunit, which mediates electron transfer from ubiquinol at the Qp site to cytochrome c1 through a 60° rotation of its extrinsic soluble domain and a resulting 16-Å displacement of the [2Fe-2S] cluster (Fig. 1) (7Crofts A.R.

Although these data were interpreted in terms of a requirement for the mobility of the ISP soluble domain, the extreme sensitivity of bc1 function to increases in hinge flexibility (19Darrouzet E.

Thus, it is of interest to study the function of the putative hinge region in the b6f complex (Table I).Table ISequence alignment of the ISP hinge region in the cytochrome bc1and b6f complexesView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab Because the structure of the ISP and the predicted structures of the cytochrome b6 and subunit IV in the b6f complex are similar to the structures of the ISP and cytochrome b in the bc1 complex, it is expected that the ISP in the stigmatellin- or DBMIB-bound b6f complex is in a position and orientation similar to those observed in the stigmatellin-bound bc1 complex (Fig. 2). Three lines of evidence indicate that the ISP in the b6f complex may also act as a mobile redox center. (i) EPR studies defined different orientations for the [2Fe-2S] cluster of the ISP extrinsic domain in the presence and absence of the Qp site quinol analog inhibitor DBMIB (27Schoepp B. Brugna M. Riedel A. Nitschke W. Kramer D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or inhibitory metal ions (28Roberts A.G. Bowman M.K. Kramer D.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4070-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). (ii) The rate of flash-induced reduction of cytochromes b6 and f is systematically inhibited as a function of ambient extrinsic viscosity in situ (29Heimann S. Ponamarev M.V. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2692-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). (iii) An 8-residue segment containing 4–7 Gly, 0–3 Ser, 0–1 Thr, and 0–2 Ala residues, whose alignment with the set of Rieske ISP sequences suggests that it is a putative hinge region, is present in the b6f complex (Table I). The sequence of this segment is conserved in the ISP sequences of b6f complexes from various organisms (Table I) and suggests a higher degree of conformational flexibility than in the bc1 complex. Thus, it is anticipated that a movement of the ISP soluble domain is involved in electron transfer from quinol to cytochrome f in the b6f complex. To probe the role of the putative ISP hinge region in the b6f complex, the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, previously used for site-directed mutagenesis of cytochrome b6 and subunit IV (30Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was used for mutagenesis of the ISP. In contrast to the bc1 complex, the function of the b6f complex was found to be insensitive to large perturbations of the ISP hinge region, implying major differences between the complexes either in structural barriers to motion of the ISP soluble domain or in the amplitude of its motion. Growth of Cultures—Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 wild-type and mutant strains were grown in medium A (31Buzby J.S. Porter R.D. Stevens Jr., S.E. Science. 1985; 230: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) supplemented with spectinomycin at 100 μg/ml for mutants. Liquid cultures were grown at 38 °C under cool-white fluorescent illumination at a light intensity of ∼100 microeinsteins/m2/s, bubbled with air supplemented with ∼2.0% (v/v) CO2. Cell densities were determined from the absorbance at 730 nm. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Construction—A PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene) was performed as described (32Ponamarev M.V. Schlarb B.G. Howe C.J. Carrell C.J. Smith J.L. Bendall D.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5971-5976Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of mutations and the intactness of the remainder of the petC1 genes on plasmids and in the Synechococcus genome were analyzed by DNA sequencing. For mutants 4Pro, 6Pro, and +4G, the intactness of their genomic petB and petD genes, which encode cytochrome b6 and subunit IV, was confirmed by sequencing. A 3.5-kb segment encompassing the petCA operon and 1.5 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence was digested from pUHWRW1 (33Widger W.R. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 30: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) with XbaI and KpnI and cloned into the XbaI and KpnI sites of pUC19 to generate plasmid I. A HindIII site (silent mutation) was introduced into the 3′-end of the petC1 gene by site-directed mutagenesis with CTG TCC AGT CGG TGA AGC TTC ACC GAC TGG ACA G (mutation sites are underlined) and its complementary primer to generate plasmid II, which was digested with HindIII; and the resulting 4.5-kb segment was cyclized by ligation to generate plasmid III. A new PacI site was introduced at a site ∼30 bp upstream of the petC1 start codon by mutagenesis with GGA AGT ATT GTA GAA ACG CTT AAT TAA CTA TAC AAA AGG CTC TG and its complementary primer. The resulting plasmid IV was linearized at a site ∼500 bp upstream of petC1 by PCR with Pfu polymerase and primers GGC CCG TTC TCC CAA TTC C and GGC AGA ATG GCT GTT GGG TTA ATC C. The aadA cassette (34Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), which encodes an aminoglycoside 3′-adenyltransferase and confers spectinomycin resistance to the host strains, was ligated with the linearized plasmid IV to generate plasmid V, which contains an aadA cassette located ∼500 bp upstream of petC1. A 3.8-kb fragment including the 5′-part of petC1 and the 5′-flanking sequence with the aadA cassette was excised from plasmid V by restriction digestion with PmlI and BamHI and ligated into the PmlI and BamHI sites of plasmid I to generate plasmid pCA1, which contains the whole petCA operon and an inserted aadA cassette (2.0 kb) in its 5′-flanking sequence (1.5 kb). This was the final plasmid used to transform the Synechococcus cells. pCA1 was digested with PmlI and HpaI to remove the 5′-flanking sequence and then religated to create construct pCA2. Mutations in petC1 were first made on plasmid pCA2 by site-directed mutagenesis, and then the petCA operon containing the desired mutation was excised from pCA2 by PacI and XbaI digestion and cloned into the PacI and XbaI sites of pCA1 to generate the pCA1 mutant. To delete the petC1 gene in the petCA operon, PmlI and SmaI unique sites were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends of petC1 by site-directed mutagenesis with CT ATA CAA AAG GCT CTG ATT ATG CAC GTG ACT CAA TTA TCA GGT TCC T and C CGT ACT GAC GAA GCT CCC GGG TGG GCC TAA AAA CCC CAT ACG and their complementary primers. The resulting pCA2 mutant was digested with PmlI and SmaI to remove petC1 and religated to generate plasmid pCA2-ΔpetC1. The petCA-ΔpetC1 operon was then excised from pCA2-ΔpetC1 and cloned into pCA1 to generate pCA1-ΔpetC1. Mutations in the ISP hinge region were made by site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers (complementary primers not shown): P44A/P45A, CCC GTT ATT AAA TAT TTT ATT GCT GCT TCT AGT GGT GGC; S46G/S47G, GTT ATT AAA TAT TTT ATT CCT CCT GGT GGT GGT GGC GCT GGT GG; 4Pro, CCT CCT TCT AGT GGT CCC CCT CCT CCT GGC GTG ATT GC; 6Pro, CCC GTT ATT AAA TAT TTTT ATT CCT CCT CCT CCT GGT CCC CCT CCT CCT GGC; ΔA50, CCT CCT TCT AGT GGT GGC_GGT GGT GGC GTG ATT GC; ΔS46–47, GTT ATT AAA TAT TTT ATT CCT CCT__GGT GGC GCT GGT GGT GG; ΔG51–52, CCT CCT TCT AGT GGT GGC GCT__GGC GTG ATT GCT AAA GAT GCC; +2G-Δ2G, CCC GTT ATT AAA TAT TTT ATT CCT CCT GGC GGC TCT AGT GGT GGC GCT__GGC GTG; and +4Gly, CCT TCT AGT GGT GGC GCT GGT GGC GGC GGT GGT GGC GGC GTG ATT GC. Transformation of Synechococcus Cells and Screening of Complete Segregants—Transformation of Synechococcus PCC 7002 with plasmid was performed as described (30Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Buzby J.S. Porter R.D. Stevens Jr., S.E. Science. 1985; 230: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), except that, after incubation of the plasmid with cells at 37 °C under light for 90 min, the plasmid/cell mixture was applied to medium A plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin. After 7–10 days of incubation, spectinomycin-resistant transformants appeared and were streaked on spectinomycin plates for further segregation. The primary screening for the complete segregants with the desired mutation in the petC1 gene of the Synechococcus genome was performed by PCR and subsequent restriction analysis of the PCR product (see Fig. 3A). Synechococcus genomic DNA for PCR was extracted as described (30Lee T. Metzger S.U. Cho Y.S. Whitmarsh J. Kallas T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 35Berthold D.A. Best B.A. Malkin R. Plant Mol. Biol. Reports. 1993; 11: 338-344Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A 1-kb fragment containing petC1 and the 5′-part of petA was amplified with a forward primer (GGG CAA ACT AAG GCT C) and a reverse primer (AAA CTT GAT CGG GTA AAA CGG). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Complete digestion of the PCR product with HindIII indicated complete segregation and absence of the wild-type allele in the Synechococcus genome. The presence of the desired mutations in the petC1 gene of the Synechococcus genome and complete segregation were confirmed by sequencing of the PCR products that could be completely digested with HindIII. Oxygen Evolution—Oxygen evolution rates were measured at 39 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode and a saturating actinic light intensity of 2000–2500 microeinsteins/m2/s. Cells harvested in late log phase were suspended at a chlorophyll concentration of 10 μg/ml in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm NaHCO3. Flash Kinetic Spectroscopy—The electron transfer activity of the cytochrome b6f complex in vivo was measured in terms of the rate of flash-induced re-reduction of cytochromes f and c6 in their α-band absorption region (ΔA556-540 nm) using a spectrometer as described (36Ponamarev M.V. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17199-17208Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Synechococcus cells were harvested in late log phase and kept in darkness. Prior to measurement, cells were suspended at 5 μm chlorophyll in reaction medium consisting of 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, and 10 mm NaHCO3. 10 μm 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, 1 mm NH2OH, and 10 μm carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone were added to dissipate flash-induced absorbance changes from photosystem II and to disrupt the transmembrane electrochemical potential. To eliminate variation in the redox state of the plastoquinone pool in the dark, 1.0 mm KCN was incubated at room temperature (1 min) to block respiration. Homology Modeling of the Cytochrome b6f Complex—From the sequence similarity between the cytochrome b in the bc1 complex and cytochrome b6 /subunit IV and the positions of the invariant residues (5Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Cramer W.A. Martinez S.E. Huang D. Tae G.S. Everly R.M. Heymann J.B. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. Smith J.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), it has been concluded that cytochrome b6 and subunit IV should have the same general structure as the N- and C-terminal domains of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (5Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 37Cramer W.A. Martinez S.E. Huang D. Tae G.S. Everly R.M. Heymann J.B. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. Smith J.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Also, from the high degree of sequence conservation observed around the Qp site that contacts the ISP and the nearly identical primary and tertiary structures of the cluster-binding ISP small subdomain in chloroplasts and mitochondria (9Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 37Cramer W.A. Martinez S.E. Huang D. Tae G.S. Everly R.M. Heymann J.B. Cheng R.H. Baker T.S. Smith J.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the ISP in the stigmatellin-bound b6f complex should be in a similar position and orientation as observed in the stigmatellin-bound bc1 complex. Therefore, three of the four large subunits in the b6f complex can be modeled within the complex, whereas the position of the unique cytochrome f is not known. A model of the b6f complex in which the ISP is located at the Qp site and cytochrome f is excluded was built by homology modeling with SWISS MODEL and SWISS-pdb viewer (38Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the yeast bc1 complex with stigmatellin (Protein Data Bank code 1EZV) (15Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) was used as a template for the homology modeling. The structure of the Synechococcus ISP soluble domain was modeled from the crystal structure of the spinach ISP soluble domain (Protein Data Bank code 1RFS) (9Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and superimposed on the complex based on the structural similarity of the cluster-binding small subdomains between the mitochondrial and chloroplast ISPs (9Carrell C.J. Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The petC1 Gene Encodes Functional ISP—The ISP of the b6f complex is encoded by the petC gene in higher plants and cyanobacteria. Originally, only one petC gene (petC1), which is located in the petCA operon, was reported for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (33Widger W.R. Photosynth. Res. 1991; 30: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, a BLAST search in the recently deposited genome (NCBI accession number NC_003488) indicated that, as in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (39Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Roegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), there are two additional petC genes (petC2 and petC3) in the Synechococcus genome. In Synechocystis, the petC gene located in the petCA operon was shown to be the dominant species in membranes and in isolated b6f complex by immunoblotting (39Schneider D. Skrzypczak S. Anemuller S. Schmidt C.L. Seidler A. Roegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10949-10954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To study the function of PetC1 and its hinge region, a ΔpetC1 mutant with the entire petC1 gene deleted and nine hinge region mutants with changes in the composition, flexibility, and length of the hinge region were constructed (Table II).Table IICell growth and electron transfer activity of the wild type and hinge region mutants of Synechococcus sp.

All hinge region mutants reported in this study (listed in Table II) were segregated completely from the wild type. The PCR products of their genomic petC1 genes could all be digested completely with HindIII (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–9) (data for mutant 6Pro not shown). All these mutants grew well under photosynthetic conditions with a growth rate (doubling time of 4.5–6.2 h) similar to that of the wild type (doubling time of 5.4 h) (Table II). Analysis of the content of the b6f complex in membranes by Western blotting and heme staining indicated that the assembly and stability of the b6f complex were not significantly affected in these mutants (data not shown). On the contrary, no segregant could be obtained for the ΔpetC1 mutant. Thus, both wild-type and ΔpetC1 alleles were present in the PCR products of non-segregants (Fig. 3B, lane 10), implying an essential role of the petC1 gene product for Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. In addition, certain mutations (e.g. deletion of Gly51 and Gly52) in the PetC1 hinge region caused a significant decrease in the electron transfer activity of the b6f complex and a loss of its sensitivity to DBMIB (discussed below), suggesting a dominant role of PetC1 in the function of the b6f complex. Therefore, it was concluded that petC1 codes for the essential ISP in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, whereas petC2 and petC3 are silent in the function of the b6f complex. This makes it practical to analyze the structure and function of the ISP by mutagenesis of petC1 without knockout of petC2 and petC3 in Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. Flash-induced Cytochrom"
https://openalex.org/W2167158578,"Abstract Tumor immunology has received a large impetus from the identification of tumor-associated antigens. Among them, a monoclonal antibody, 22.1.1, was instrumental in defining a novel tumor-associated antigen that was termed “receptor binding cancer antigen expressed on SiSo cells” (RCAS1). RCAS1 was proposed to induce growth arrest and apoptosis on activated immune cells, mediated by a putative death receptor. Structurally, RCAS1 was predicted to exist as a type II transmembrane protein and in a soluble form. Here, we analyzed occurrence, membrane topology, and subcellular localization of the RCAS1-encoded gene product. RCAS1 was shown to be a ubiquitously expressed type III transmembrane protein with a Golgi-predominant localization. Monoclonal antibody 22.1.1 failed to recognize RCAS1, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy. Instead, we showed that the cognate 22.1.1 epitope is identical with the tumor-associated O-linked glycan Tn (N-acetyl-d-galactosamine, GalNAc). Overexpression of RCAS1 in cell lines that are negative for 22.1.1 surface staining led to the generation of Tn and the closely related TF (Thomsen-Friedenreich, Galβ1–3GalNAc) antigen, thus providing a functional link to the generation of the 22.1.1 epitope. We suggest that RCAS1 modulates surface expression of tumor-associated, normally cryptic O-linked glycan structures and contributes indirectly to the antigenicity of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986073584,"The inhibitor-of-growth (ING) family of proteins was founded by human ING1, a tumor suppressor interacting with p53 in vivo and required for its function in transcription/apoptosis. There are five different ING genes in humans, three of which have been linked to p53 function. In this study, we analyzed the three ING family members present in yeast. We demonstrate that each one is purified as a key component of a specific histone-modifying complex. Pho23 is part of Rpd3/Sin3 histone deacetylase complex, while Yng1 and Yng2 are subunits of the NuA3 and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complexes, respectively. We also show that the three different ING proteins have opposite roles in transcriptional activation by p53 in vivo. These effects are linked to the presence of each ING in its respective chromatin modifying complex, since mutation of the corresponding catalytic subunit gave similar results. Depletion of Pho23/Rpd3 leads to increased p53-dependent transcription in vivo while depletion of Yng2 abrogates it. Surprisingly, deletion of YNG1 or SAS3 leads to increased transcriptional activation by p53. These data suggest that the NuA3 complex can function in gene-specific repression, an unusual role for a histone acetyltransferase complex.

ING 1The abbreviations used are: ING, inhibitor of growth; HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TAP, tandem affinity purification. (inhibitor of growth) gene family encodes a group of homologous nuclear proteins conserved during evolution and involved in the modulation of various important cellular functions. ING1, the founding member of this family, was initially discovered as candidate tumor suppressor (1Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Since then, there were several lines of evidence confirming ING1 as a human tumor suppressor that plays a variety of important roles in the cell (reviewed in (2Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 532-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar)). All the family members have significant homology over their entire sequence and share a highly conserved PHD zinc finger domain at their C terminus. In humans there are five ING genes, named ING1 to ING5 (2Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 532-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The structure and function of the ING1 gene has been the most thoroughly studied. Overexpression of ING1 hinders cell growth, while an antisense construct activates cell transformation and dramatically increases the replicative life of normal fibroblasts suggesting a role of this protein in the cell senescence. Elevated expression of ING1 and ING4 also promote apoptosis. Expression and mutational analyses in several tumor types show that ING1 is down-regulated in cancers, which is also the case for ING3 (reviewed in Ref. 2Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 532-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). ING proteins seem to collaborate with the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which is involved in various anti-tumor processes including cell-cycle regulation, apoptosis, and senescence. Interestingly, ING1-mediated growth inhibition requires a functional p53 and results in p53-dependent transcriptional activation of the p21/WAF1 gene, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (3Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In vivo, ING1 and p53 co-immunoprecipitate from cell extracts, suggesting a direct functional interaction (3Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, functional interaction was also found between ING2, ING3, and p53 as both enhance the transactivation function of p53 (2Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 532-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the human ING proteins seem to have important biological functions, the exact mechanism by which they modulate p53 activity and how they affect various cellular processes are not known. Part of the answer comes from studies on the yeast homologs. Indeed, Yng1 and Yng2, two of the three yeast ING proteins, are subunits of the NuA3 and NuA4 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complexes, respectively (4Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Pho23, the third yeast ING protein, was shown to interact with the Rpd3/Sin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex (7Loewith R. Smith J.S. Meijer M. Williams T.J. Bachman N. Boeke J.D. Young D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24068-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, human ING1 is able to suppress yng2 mutation in yeast, suggesting a functional conservation between yeast and human ING proteins (4Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The fact that all yeast ING proteins are physically associated to HAT and potentially HDAC complexes suggests that other ING proteins could be linked to such activities. Indeed, ING1 is a stable component of a mSin3/HDAC1 complex and was suggested to interact with various HATs such as PCAF, CBP, and p300 (8Kuzmichev A. Zhang Y. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 9Vieyra D. Loewith R. Scott M. Bonnefin P. Boisvert F.M. Cheema P. Pastyryeva S. Meijer M. Johnston R.N.

These observations are consistent with a mechanism whereby ING proteins cooperate with p53 by modulating chromatin structure. Interestingly, in addition to the functional conservation between ING1 and Yng2, transcriptional activation of a p21 reporter gene by p53 functions in yeast cells and requires Yng2 (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This transactivation function is mediated by direct in vivo interaction between the NuA4 complex and p53, which targets localized histone H4 hyperacetylation (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These observations clearly demonstrate that the p53/ING molecular relationship is evolutionary conserved and could explain the biological role of ING proteins. To further understand the mechanism whereby ING proteins modulate different cellular processes, this functional interaction was investigated. Given the conservation between yeast and human INGs, we decided to study the functional relationship between transcription regulation by p53 and all 3 yeast ING paralogs. We show, using tandem affinity purification (TAP) system, that cellular Yng1 and Yng2 are found exclusively in the NuA3 and NuA4 HAT complexes, respectively. We also demonstrate that Pho23 is a stable subunit of the Rpd3/Sin3 HDAC complex. To further elucidate the functional connections between p53 and yINGs, we used a yeast-based system where transcription of a p21/WAF1-HIS3 reporter gene is fully dependent on exogenously expressed p53. Our results demonstrate that yeast ING proteins play different roles in p53-dependent transcription. These roles are directly linked to the type of histone modifying activities they are associated with. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The strains expressing Yng1-TAP, Yng2-TAP, and Pho23-TAP were constructed as described previously (10Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar). The strains QY203 and QY204 were described in Ref. 5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. To generate pho23 (QY212) and rpd3 (QY213) strains, deletion of PHO23 and RPD3 was done in the strain QY204 by PCR targeting using KanMX4 cassette as selecting marker. The yng1 (YLH505), and sas3 (YJW125) deletion strains were prepared in the FY602 background (Mat a his3Δ200 leu2Δ1 lys2–128δ ura3–52 trp1Δ63) using HISMX6 as marker. The wild type and PHO23 deleted strains used for conventional purification of Rpd3 complexes were obtained from Resgen. The plasmids used for p53-driven transcription assay were described previously (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein Complex Purifications, Deacetylase Assay, and Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Purification of TAP-tagged proteins was performed as described previously (10Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar). The Rpd3/Sin3 complexes used in the deacetylase assays were purified by successive nickel-agarose, Mono Q, and Superose 6 chromatography as described previously (11Lechner T. Carrozza M.J. Yu Y. Grant P.A. Eberharter A. Vannier D. Brosch G. Stillman D.J. Shore D. Workman J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40961-40966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylase activity was measured on NuA4-modified free histones and oligonucleosomes as described previously (12Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Northern blots were performed as described previously (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 5 μl of cell extract (corresponding to 0.5 OD600 of cells) were loaded on SDS-PAGE. Monoclonal anti-p53 antibody (pAb 421) was used at 1:1000 concentration. The Yeast ING Proteins Are Found Exclusively in HAT and HDAC Multiprotein Complexes—To confirm the stable association of yeast ING proteins with multisubunit complexes and also to know if each of these proteins belongs to a unique complex, Yng1, Yng2, and Pho23 were TAP-tagged at their chromosomal loci and purified. Following the two-step affinity purification, material was analyzed on silver-stained gel (Fig. 1). We have demonstrated that Yng2 is a stable subunit of the purified NuA4 complex and that it plays primary role in NuA4 complex activity toward chromatin (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). 2Boudreault, A. A., Cronier, D., Selleck, W., Lacoste, N., Utley, R. T., Allard, S., Savard, J., Lane, W. S., Tan, S., and Côté, J. (2003) Genes Dev., in press. Here, with TAP purification from yeast strain expressing physiological levels of Yng2-TAP fusion protein, we observe that Yng2 is clearly associated with NuA4 (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Indeed, based on gel migration, Western and mass spectrometry analysis, all known NuA4 subunits are present in the purified material (data not shown). The three remaining bands (marked by asterisks) are known contaminants that are also obtained from an untagged strain (not shown). We did not observe additional specific bands that might correspond to other Yng2-containing complex. Based on these data, and since Yng2 does not appear more abundant than the other proteins in the purified material, we can conclude that Yng2 is found exclusively associated with NuA4 in the cell. We have recently found that Yng1 is associated with the NuA3 HAT complex and that it is required for efficient acetylation of chromatin by the complex (6Howe L. Kusch T. Muster N. Chaterji R. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, we show here that affinity purification of Yng1-TAP also brings protein bands corresponding to Sas3 and Anc1/Taf30, two previously known subunits of the NuA3 complex (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Again this confirms our previous finding demonstrating Yng1 as a stable component of NuA3 (6Howe L. Kusch T. Muster N. Chaterji R. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The other bands detected also correspond in size to protein bands previously found in purified NuA3. Since Yng1 is not more abundant than any other band on the gel, this suggests that most if not all Yng1 is associated with NuA3 in the cell. Pho23 was also linked to chromatin modification. When over-expressed in vivo Pho23 was previously shown to co-immunoprecipitate with Rpd3 and Sap30, two subunits of the Rpd3/Sin3 HDAC complex (7Loewith R. Smith J.S. Meijer M. Williams T.J. Bachman N. Boeke J.D. Young D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24068-24074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Deletion of PHO23 was also shown to create phenotypes similar to rpd3 and sin3. Pho23 affinity purification produced several specific protein bands of similar intensity (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Based on gel migration and Western analysis, several of these bands correspond to known components of the Rpd3/Sin3 complex. Since Pho23 is not more abundant than the other bands, this indicates that most if not all Pho23 protein is a stable subunit of the Rpd3/Sin3 complex in the cell. In agreement with this, Pho23 was found associated with Sin3-TAP and Rpd3-TAP (data not shown). In addition, we tested the effect of PHO23 deletion on conventionally purified Rpd3/Sin3 complex deacetylase activity (Fig. 1B). We measured histone deacetylase activity on 3H-labeled chromatin substrate or free histones using Rpd3/Sin3 complexes purified from wild type and pho23 mutant strains. When the assays were normalized for the levels of HDAC activity on free histones, we observed a significant decrease in nucleosomal HDAC activity in the pho23 mutant (Fig. 1B). Our results indicate a crucial role for Pho23 in Rpd3/Sin3 HDAC activity on chromatin substrate, similar to what was found for Yng1 and Yng2 in NuA3 and NuA4 HAT activities (5Nourani A. Doyon Y.

S., Tan, S., and Côté, J. (2003) Genes Dev., in press. Yng2 and Pho23 Have Opposite Effect on p53-dependent Transcription in Yeast—Since tumor suppressor p53 is known to function as a transcriptional activator in yeast and human ING proteins have been linked to p53 function, it is interesting to study yeast ING protein requirement for p53-dependent transcription in vivo. We have already shown that Yng2 is required for transactivation of a p21/WAF1-HIS3 hybrid reporter gene by p53 and for targeted histone H4 hyperacetylation (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since Pho23 is a subunit of the Rpd3/Sin3 HDAC complex, we wanted to know if this factor could also play a role in p53 transcription potential. We used the same yeast system where p53 is constitutively expressed in cells bearing a p21/WAF1-HIS3 reporter plasmid. In this experiment, we analyzed by Northern blot p53-dependent transcription in wild type and pho23-deleted strains (Fig. 2A). We also used an isogenic yng2 strain in comparison for this experiment. In the wild type strain expression of p53 is required to activate transcription of the reporter gene. As we have shown previously, deletion of YNG2 cripples p53-dependent transactivation (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, deletion of PHO23 has the opposite effect. Transactivation of p21-HIS3 by p53 is more potent in pho23 cells when compared with wild type (lanes 2 and 6). To elucidate the mechanism by which Pho23 inhibits p53-dependent transcription, we repeated the experiment in an isogenic strain mutated for Rpd3, the catalytic subunit of the HDAC complex containing Pho23. As shown in Fig. 2B, we observe the same increased p53-dependent transactivation of p21-HIS3 in both pho23 and rpd3 strains as compared with wild type strain. Importantly, the activation of the reporter gene by pho23 and rpd3 deletion is equal (Fig. 2C), suggesting that Pho23 role is directly mediated by Rpd3 histone deacetylase activity. Interestingly, the PHO23 gene was first isolated as a repressor of PHO5 transcription (13Lau W.W. Schneider K.R. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1349-1359PubMed Google Scholar). It is also known that Rpd3 has an inhibitory role on PHO5 in rich media (14Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These observations are confirmed in our experiment since we observe an increase of PHO5 mRNA levels in both pho23 and rpd3 mutants (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast to the p21-HIS3 signal, this increase is p53-independent. It is known that rpd3 mutation affects the histone H3 and H4 acetylation state at the PHO5 promoter, leading to derepression of the gene (14Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In the case of p21-HIS3, it is possible that rpd3 and pho23 mutations lead to an increase in H3 and H4 acetylation over the promoter region, provoking an elevated transcriptional activation. Interestingly, we have previously shown that p53 recruits the yeast NuA4 HAT activity and targets histone H4 hyperacetylation to the p21-HIS3 promoter region, a process dependent on the presence of Yng2 (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Altogether, these observations support a model in which p53 regulates transcription of its target genes in mammalian cells by modifying their chromatin structure through recruitment of ING-containing complexes. Accordingly, it was recently demonstrated that p53 modulates Mdm2 gene transcription by recruiting TRRAP-containing complexes that modify the acetylation status of histone H3 and H4 at that promoter (15Ard P.G. Chatterjee C. Kunjibetty S. Adside L.R. Gralinski L.E. McMahon S.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5650-5661Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It should be noted that TRRAP is the homologue of yeast Tra1, a subunit of the NuA4 and SAGA HAT complexes (16Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Côté J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Yng1 Inhibits p53-dependent Transcription—Yng1, the third and last member of yeast ING family, is a subunit of the NuA3 HAT complex. Purified NuA3 complex fails to interact with acidic activators in vitro but can stimulate transcription from pre-assembled chromatin templates (17Steger D.J. Eberharter A. John S. Grant P.A. Workman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12924-12929Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Sas3, the catalytic subunit, has not been shown to be involved in transcription of specific genes in vivo. A hint to a role in transcription is provided by the fact that NuA3 interacts with Spt16, a subunit of the yeast CP/FACT complex, supporting a role in transcription elongation (18John S. Howe L. Tafrov S.T. Grant P.A. Sternglanz R. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1196-1208PubMed Google Scholar). Testing Yng1 function in p53-dependent transcription could directly implicate NuA3 in transcription regulation in vivo. In Fig. 3A we analyzed by Northern blot the transcription of p21-HIS3 reporter gene in wild type, yng2, pho23, and yng1 strains, in the presence or the absence of p53. As shown before, Yng2 is required for p21-HIS3 transcription while Pho23 inhibits it, in agreement with the general acetylation/deacetylation model of gene regulation. Surprisingly, deletion of YNG1 results in increased p53-dependent level of p21-HIS3 mRNA when compared with the isogenic wild type strain (compare lanes 8 and 10). This increase in yng1 cells is almost identical to the one observed in pho23 cells, indicating a similar level of inhibition exerted by these two ING proteins on p53-dependent transcription. As shown before, PHO5 transcription requires Yng2/NuA4 and is repressed by Pho23/Rpd3. Importantly, YNG1 deletion has no effect on PHO5 transcription. Therefore, this observation suggests a specific role of Yng1 on p53 function in transcription. Our results clearly indicate that two of the three yeast ING proteins, Pho23 and Yng1, play negative roles on transcriptional activation by p53. Since this could be the result of an indirect effect on p53 production or stability, we analyzed p53 steady state levels in the respective isogenic strains (Fig. 3C). No significant difference in p53 abundance is seen between all strain tested (the same is true for yng2 strains (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). These observations clearly indicate that Pho23 and Yng1 inhibitory role is not due to an indirect effect on p53 production/stability. Inhibition of p53-dependent Transcription by NuA3 HAT Subunit—It is intriguing that Yng1 specifically inhibits p53-dependent transcription while it is a subunit of the NuA3 HAT complex, a type of activity generally linked to transcription activation. Moreover, Yng1 and Sas3, the catalytic subunit of NuA3, antagonize silencing at mutated HMR loci, suggesting a positive role in transcription (6Howe L. Kusch T. Muster N. Chaterji R. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether the inhibitory role of Yng1 on p53-dependent transcription is linked to NuA3 HAT activity. To address this question we analyzed the effect of SAS3 deletion on p53 transactivation function. Wild type, yng1, and sas3 strains expressing or not p53 were analyzed for transcription of the p21-HIS3 reporter gene (Fig. 3D). In the presence of equal amounts of p53, deletion of YNG1 or SAS3 results in an increase of p21-HIS3 mRNA compared with wild type. This result indicates a requirement for NuA3 HAT activity in inhibition of p53-dependent transcription. Importantly, it is the first evidence suggesting an inhibitory role of the NuA3 complex in transcription. The question whether this effect is direct remains to be answered although the presence of an ING protein in NuA3 argues for a direct role in p53 function. On the other hand, in contrast to the NuA4 complex, no direct interaction between NuA3 and recombinant p53 could be detected in vitro (6Howe L. Kusch T. Muster N. Chaterji R. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, this result must be interpreted with some caution since p53 can be modified in vivo, a process that regulates interactions with partners, including HAT complexes (19Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Additionally, we could not detect acetylation of p53 by NuA3 in vitro, which is similar to results found with NuA4 (data not shown). Bulk histone H3 acetylation is controlled in yeast by Gcn5, the catalytic subunit of SAGA complex, and Sas3/NuA3 (20Howe L. Auston D. Grant P. John S. Cook R.G. Workman J.L. Pillus L. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3144-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We have shown that transcription activation of the p21-HIS3 gene by p53 correlates with targeted histone H4 hyperacetylation (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). On the other hand we did not detect any change in the level of histone H3 acetylation over the promoter region. It is possible that histone H3 acetylation by NuA3 on the p21-HIS3 gene is detrimental to p53-dependent transcription. On the other hand the other major H3 HAT in yeast, Gcn5, is required for efficient p53-dependent transcription in yeast and interaction between p53 and SAGA was found in vitro. 3A. Nourani and R. T. Utley, unpublished results. One hypothesis is that the role of Gcn5 in p53-dependent transcription is through direct acetylation of the p53 protein, as was found for the human homologs, hGcn5 and p/CAF (21Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). We cannot rule out the possibility that NuA3 modifies directly or indirectly the expression/activity of a p53 co-activator/co-repressor and therefore modulate p21-HIS3 gene expression. While HAT activity involvement in gene repression is unusual, it was recently reported that the Hos2 deacetylase is directly required for gene activation (22Wang A. Kurdistani S.K. Grunstein M. Science. 2002; 298: 1412-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). This important observation strongly suggests that histone acetylation and gene activation do not always correlate and supports the possibility of NuA3 being directly involved in gene repression. We have demonstrated that yeast ING proteins are exclusively found in chromatin modifying complexes. The structural and functional conservation of ING proteins throughout evolution allows us to study the properties and functions of yeast INGs and extend our findings about the mechanisms thereby they affect a number of cellular processes. For example human ING1 is able to complement YNG2 deletion in yeast (4Loewith R. Meijer M. Lees-Miller S.P. Riabowol K. Young D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3807-3816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A number of mammalian INGs cooperate with p53 and are involved in control of its transcriptional activities. We show that in yeast p53 also functionally interacts with the three INGs. While NuA4 HAT component Yng2 plays an essential role, Yng1 and Pho23 hinder p53-dependent transcription. These observations indicate that p53-ING interaction is an important property that could explain how ING proteins regulate important cellular functions such as cell proliferation, senescence, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Our work suggests that ING proteins are key factors in chromatin modification in vivo. Accordingly, human ING1 has been found associated with HDAC and HAT activities (2Feng X. Hara Y. Riabowol K. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 532-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In addition to being subunits of chromatin modifying complexes, it seems that INGs play an important role in catalytic function. YNG1 and YNG2 deletions cause important decrease in NuA3 and NuA4 activities toward chromatin without disrupting these complexes (5Nourani A. Doyon Y. Utley R.T. Allard S. Lane W.S. Côté J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7629-7640Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Howe L. Kusch T. Muster N. Chaterji R. Yates III, J.R. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5047-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Moreover, recombinant Yng2 is required with Esa1 in a recombinant core HAT complex to acetylate chromatin substrates.2 The same can now be said about Pho23 for deacetylation of chromatin substrate by the Sin3/Rpd3 complex. Therefore, we suggest that the p53/ING functional link is part of a global function mediated by chromatin-modifying complexes, which is conserved during evolution. We are grateful to N. Lacoste for the Yng2-TAP strain and C. Di Como and B. Séraphin for the FASAY and TAP system plasmids."

Cells transformed with both genes became almost as resistant as P. fluorescens. These results suggest that the presence of IleRS-R2 could be the major reason why P. fluorescens is intrinsically resistant to the antibiotic.

This antibiotic is known as a potent inhibitor of many bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases (IleRSs). 1The abbreviations used are: IleRSs, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases; aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: IleRSs, isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases; aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; DTT, dithiothreitol. It competitively inhibits IleRS with respect to isoleucine (2Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), thereby arresting protein synthesis. The inhibitory constants (K i) for prokaryotic (eubacterial and archaebacterial) IleRSs in in vitro aminoacylation reaction are generally 10–8 to 10–9m (2Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 3Capobianco J.O. Doran C.C. Goldman R.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1989; 33: 156-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Rechsteiner T. Leisinger T. Eur. J. Biol. 1989; 181: 41-46Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, this antibiotic has little or no potency toward eukaryotic IleRSs (2Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 5Racher K.I. Kalmar G.B. Borgford T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17158-17164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This striking specificity in the mode of action and in its unique structure place pseudomonic acid into an unusual class of antibacterial agents (6Parenti M.A. Hatfield S.M. Leyden J.J. Clin. Pharm. 1987; 6: 761-770PubMed Google Scholar, 7Neu H.C. Science. 1992; 257: 1064-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar) and have led to the clinical use of pseudomonic acid as a topical antibacterial agent to prevent Staphylococcus aureus infection (8Sutherland R. Boon R.J. Griffin K.E. Masters P.J. Slocombe B. White A.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 495-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 9Casewell M.W. Hill R.L.R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1987; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).IleRS, the target of antibiotic pseudomonic acid, is one of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), which play a crucial role in the first step of protein biosynthesis, because they are responsible for accurate charging of specific tRNAs with their cognate amino acids (10Schimmel P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 125-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 11Carter C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Twenty amino acid-specific aaRSs can be divided into two classes, each of which contains 10 enzymes (11Carter C.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 13Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 14Cusack S.C. Berthet-Colominas C. Hartlin M. Nassar N. Leverman R. Nature. 1990; 347: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Class I aaRSs, including IleRS, each display two short common consensus sequences, called HIGH and KMSKS, which form a Rossman nucleotide binding fold and play an important role in enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, based on their species-specific conserved sequences, aaRSs can generally be subdivided into either a eubacteria type or an archaeal/eukaryote type (12Shiba K. Motegi H. Schimmel P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 453-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Like other general antibiotic-producing organisms, P. fluorescens is entirely insensitive to the antibiotic it produces, pseudomonic acid (18Hughes J. Mellows G. Soughton S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Antibiotic-producing bacteria have several common strategies to prevent their own antibiotics from killing them (19Cundliffe E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1989; 43: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). By kinetic analysis it has been revealed that the affinity of P. fluorescens crude IleRS for pseudomonic acid is dramatically lower than that of Escherichia coli (2Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18Hughes J. Mellows G. Soughton S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has thus been considered that the difference in the molecular structure of IleRS causes difference in affinity for the antibiotic (the difference in inhibition) and that this structural alteration makes P. fluorescens cells highly resistant to pseudomonic acid.In this report we provide evidence for two distinct IleRSs (IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2) in P. fluorescens. The former is an enzyme that we reported earlier (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the latter is a quite newly found enzyme that has a markedly reduced affinity for the antibiotic and thereby confers upon the organism a strong resistance to pseudomonic acid. We concluded that the self-defense of the pseudomonic acid producer might be caused mainly by the production of an additional IleRS. The amino acid sequence deduced from the novel ileS gene was similar to eukaryotic IleRSs and evolutionarily distinct from IleRS-R1. The physiological significance of two ileS genes in pseudomonic acid-producing P. fluorescens, and the origin of the newfound ileS gene is also discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials, Enzymes, and Chemicals—Biochemical and molecular biological procedures were performed using commercially available enzymes, chemicals, and other materials. The pseudomonic acid was a gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (Betchworth, Surrey, UK).Culture Media and Growth Conditions—E. coli cells were grown in LB or SOB medium (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, p. A.2. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). P. fluorescens cells were grown at 26 °C in either LB culture medium or in agar medium (pH 7.0), the latter containing 10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 10 g of Bacto-proteose peptone number 3, 1.5 g of dipotassium phosphate, and 1.5 g of magnesium sulfate (per liter).Enzyme Assay of IleRS and Kinetic Studies—Aminoacylation activities were measured in the standard mixture (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 50 μml-[U-14C]isoleucine (50 μCi/mmol), 1 or 4 mm ATP, 5 mg/ml E. coli tRNA, and appropriate amounts of IleRS). Kinetic constants were determined as described previously (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Preparation of Crude Cell Extract—P. fluorescens cells were cultured in LB medium (10 ml) at 26 °C for 15 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g, and the pellet was suspended in buffer A5 (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspensions were sonicated, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 165,000 × g for 2 h and then dialyzed overnight against buffer A5. The crude enzyme was used for kinetic analysis. The protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry (see Ref. 46Bensadoun A. Weinstein D. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 70: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar).Activity Separation of the Two IleRS of P. fluorescens by DEAE-Sephacel Chromatography—P. fluorescens NCIB10586 cells were cultured in LB medium (1 liter) at 26 °C for 12 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the pellet was suspended in buffer A5. The suspension was sonicated, and the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Subsequently, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 6 h. The solution was applied directly to a DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A1). After the column was washed with buffer A1, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 0.4 m KCl, followed by buffer A1 containing 0.4 m KCl, and then by buffer A1 containing 1 m KCl. The aminoacylation activity of the fractions was measured at 30 °C for 20 min.Purification of IleRS-R2 from P. fluorescens NCIB10586 —All steps described were performed at 4 °C. Frozen P. fluorescens cells (110 g) were suspended in buffer A5 and sonicated with an ultrasonicator. The crude cell extract was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer A5, ultrasonicated, and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 6 h. After the resulting supernatant was dialyzed for 24 h against buffer A1, the solution was applied to a column of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated with buffer A1. The column was washed, developed with 0 m to 0.4 m KCl gradient, and followed by buffer A1 containing 1 m KCl. Active fractions of eluate were collected. The DEAE-Sephacel fraction was concentrated by ultrafiltration and dialyzed against buffer A1, and then (NH)2SO4 was added to the final concentration of 1 m. This solution was loaded on a column of n-butyl-Toyopearl (Tosoh) equilibrated with buffer same as buffer A1 but containing 1 m (NH)2SO4. After the column was washed with buffer A1 containing 1 m (NH)2SO4, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1 to 0 m (NH)2SO4. Active fractions of eluate were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against buffer A1. An n-butyl-Toyopearl fraction was applied to a column of DEAE-Toyopearl (Tosoh) equilibrated with buffer A1. The column was washed, and then proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of 0 to 0.35 m KCl. Active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against the buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm DTT, and 20% glycerol (buffer B). The dialyzed solution was loaded onto a column of hydroxyapatite (Koken Biochemicals) equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed and then proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.02 to 0.35 m potassium phosphate. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and then concentrated. The homogeneity of the enzyme preparation was evaluated by a second hydroxyapatite chromatography. The concentrated solution was applied to the column equilibrated with buffer B. After the column was washed, IleRS-R2 was eluted with a gradient of 0.02 to 0.2 m potassium phosphate. Proteins were detected by absorbance at 280 nm. The eluted IleRS-R2 protein was dialyzed against the buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm DTT, and 50% glycerol. It was then stored at –20 °C (1.14 mg). To analyze the N-terminal amino acid sequence, purified IleRS-R2 was subject to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). Amino acid sequences were determined as described previously (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).PCR Amplification and Identification of P. fluorescens ileS2 Gene— For the design of degenerate oligonucleotide primers, we used highly conserved regions near the KMSKS region among known IleRSs, but we did not use regions shared with other class I aaRSs. An upstream region set of two primers was designed from amino acid sequences “DVWF(E/D)SG” (5′-GAYGTNTGGTTYGANTSNGG-3′ named V1 (where Y is C + T, S is G + C, and N is A + G + C + T), and “DCWFESG” (5′-GAYTGYTGGTTYGAYTSNGG-3′ named C1). Downstream set of the two primers were from “QTRGWFY” (5′-ARAACCANCCNCKNGTRTG-3′ named T1; K is G + T) and from “DQ(H/Y)RGWF” (5′-AACCANCCNCKRTRYTGRTC-3′ named YH1; R is A + G) (Fig. 5, red arrows above the sequence alignment). These four primers allow for all codon variations. PCR was carried out using P. fluorescens NCIB10586 genomic DNA as a template. An amplified DNA fragment of ∼130 bp was extracted from agarose gel, blunt-ended, cloned into the HincII site of pUC19, and introduced into E. coli DH5α. The DNA inserted from the isolated plasmid (pNO47) was sequenced. pNO47 was used as a PCR template to prepare the probe for Southern blotting.DNA Probes—133-bp DNA fragment, amplified using C1 and T1 primers, was gel-purified and radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by a random primer labeling kit (Takara Shuzo). The radiolabeled probe was used directly for Southern blot analysis and screening of the library. The ileS1 probe (a 126-bp DNA fragment amplified from ileS1-containing plasmid using V1 and YH1 primers) was also radiolabeled and used for Southern blot analysis.Cloning and Sequencing of P. fluorescens ileS2 Gene—For cloning, EcoRI-digested P. fluorescens DNA was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. An ∼8.5-kbp fraction of DNA fragments identified by Southern blot analysis was electroeluted from the gel, ligated into EcoRI-treated pTWV228, and introduced into E. coli DH5α cells. E. coli cells transformed with plasmids were subjected to colony hybridization analysis using the radiolabeled 133-bp probe, which gave two strong hybridization signals out of 3000 recombinants. An isolated clone (pR2), carrying the ileS2 insert on an 8.3-kbp DNA fragment, a structural gene and ∼1000 bp of the flanking region, was completely sequenced.Western Blot Analysis—Each portion of the DEAE-Sephacel column fraction of P. fluorescens cell extract was fractionated by electrophoresis through an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon membrane. The protein of interest was detected using specific antibodies and visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).Plasmid Construction and Expression of IleRSs in E. coli—The construction of plasmid pEXR1 (the former name is pPFNB7) was described previously (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To construct pEXR2, the P. fluorescens ileS2 gene with PCR-modified 5′- and 3′-ends was ligated into the NdeI/HindIII double-digested pEXPCR expression vector. The primers used were 5′-GACAGGTGTGACAT(ATG)AGTACGGAAGGAAGTGGGCC-3′ and 5′-ACCAGTCGGCAAGCTT(TCA)GGCCAGTACGCTACGGCGC-3′ (the restriction enzyme sites are underlined, and the initiation codons or stop codons on the reverse strands are in parentheses). Plasmid pR2 was used as a template. The construct was introduced into DH5α, and the ileS2 gene was expressed as described previously (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Overexpression and Purification of Recombinant IleRS Proteins— Recombinant IleRSs were overexpressed and purified as follows. To prepare IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2, pEXR1 and pEXR2 were used, respectively, to transform E. coli strain Ts331. Transformants were grown in 3 liters of SOB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at 30 °C for 10 h with shaking. Cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A1 containing 2 μg/ml antipine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml chymostatin. The cells were broken by sonication, and crude extracts were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 6 h to remove cell debris and ribosomes. Purified IleRS proteins were obtained by three steps of column chromatography (DEAE-Toyopearl (or DEAE-Sephacel), n-butyl-Toyopearl, and hydroxyapatite) as in the case of the purification of native IleRS-R2 from P. fluorescens. Active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against buffer B. Purified IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2 were used for preparing polyclonal antibodies. The enzyme activities of recombinant IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2 expressed in E. coli cells were clearly separated from endogenous E. coli IleRS activity by column chromatography, and little or no endogenous IleRS activity can remain in these purified recombinant P. fluorescens IleRSs.Complementation Analysis—E. coli temperature-sensitive ileS mutant Ts331 was used for complementation analysis. Ts331 transformed with ileS-containing plasmids were grown at 42 °C on LB agar plates.In Vivo Pseudomonic Acid Resistance—Pseudomonic acid was diluted by 0.8% LB agar media (100 μl) at 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, and 1000 μg/ml in microtiter plates. Test organisms were grown at 30 °C overnight in the LB medium. The overnight cultures were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 × 109 cells/ml by the LB medium, and then 2-μl spots (106 cells) were inoculated onto the surfaces of the microtiter plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Pseudomonic acid sensitivity was determined as the lowest concentration needed to inhibit cell growth completely.RESULTSPseudomonic Acid Sensitivity of Crude Cell Extract from P. fluorescens—How does P. fluorescens, producer of the antibiotic pseudomonic acid, avoid suicide? To clarify the precise mechanism of its self-defense, we kinetically analyzed the IleRS activity in crude cell extract from P. fluorescens strain NCIB10586. The K m for isoleucine was determined to be 10.4 μm, but the K m for ATP was observed as biphasic in the Line-weaver-Burk plot and measured as two Michaelis constants (15.2 and 142.9 μm). We could not calculate the K i value for pseudomonic acid precisely from its inhibition curves (Fig. 1). At 4 mm ATP, 22.7% of the total aminoacylation activity was drastically inhibited in the presence of as little as 5 μm pseudomonic acid. But the remaining activity could not be abolished; even when the antibiotic was increased to 1 mm, 64.9% of the total activity remained (Fig. 1A). When the activity was measured at 1 mm ATP, 32.1% of the enzyme activity was drastically inhibited in the presence of 100 nm pseudomonic acid, but 45.5% of the activity remained even in the presence of 1 mm pseudomonic acid (Fig. 1B). So we kinetically analyzed the purified IleRS-R1 (the previously reported IleRS) (25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to find that K i values for pseudomonic acid with respect to isoleucine and ATP were calculated as an order of 10–8m (Table I). It was curious that the K i values were considerably lower than those measured with crude extract reported so far (14.5 mm) (18Hughes J. Mellows G. Soughton S. FEBS Lett. 1980; 122: 322-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, the K i values of IleRS-R1 appeared not to be able to explain why P. fluorescens is resistant to high concentrations of pseudomonic acid (>1000 μg/ml) (Tables I and II). From these results, we hypothesized that the crude extract from the pseudomonic acid-producing bacteria contains more than one IleRS.Fig. 1Effect of pseudomonic acid on IleRS activity of crude cell extract from P. fluorescens. Aminoacylation activities of S100 supernatants were measured in the standard buffer (4 mm (A) or 1 mm (B) ATP) in the absence or presence of various concentrations (10 nm to 1 mm) of pseudomonic acid at 37 °C. An activity level of 100% corresponds to the formation of 9.86 (A) or 7.9 nmol (B) of isoleucyl-tRNA per min per mg of protein at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IKinetic parameters of P. fluorescens IleRSsIleRSKmIleKiIleKmATPKiATPkcatμMnMμMnMs-1P. fluorescens IleRS-R1aP. fluorescens IleRSs purified from E. coli cells expressing each protein.1.2510.57.04150.177P. fluorescens IleRS-R2aP. fluorescens IleRSs purified from E. coli cells expressing each protein.12.2>1 × 106bIleRS-R2 showed little or no inhibition under standard conditions in the presence of 5 or 1 mM pseudomonic acid.

Western blot analysis using anti-IleRS-R1 antibody showed that the IleRS-R1 was fractionated in the first peak eluting at a lower salt concentration (0.25 m KCl) but not in the second peak (Fig. 3). With the addition of 20 μm pseudomonic acid to IleRS-R1, the peak seen earlier was completely abolished, whereas the second peak (the 0.4 m KCl fraction) was fully active under the same conditions (Fig. 2), suggesting that this fraction contains a newly found IleRS that is highly resistant to pseudomonic acid. Active fractions of pseudomonic acid-resistant IleRS (IleRS-R2) were pooled and purified to homogeneity in five further steps (Fig. 4) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified IleRS-R2 protein was determined to be STEGSGPVRFPA. By using SDS-PAGE, the molecular mass of IleRS-R2 was estimated to be 117 kDa, which was slightly higher than that of IleRS-R1 (Fig. 4, lane 6). More surprisingly, IleRS-R2 showed no inhibition in the presence of pseudomonic acid even at the concentration of 5 mm (Table I), 5 orders of magnitude greater than the K i values observed for IleRS-R1 (Table I), and 6 orders of magnitude greater than those for E. coli IleRS (2Hughes J. Mellows G. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 25Yanagisawa T. Lee J.T. Wu H.C. Kawakami M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24304-24309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aminoacylation assay solution contains IleRS-R2 enzyme only at a concentration of several nanomolars, indicating that IleRS-R2 has almost no affinity for the antibiotic. So we concluded that P. fluorescens possesses two IleRSs, each with a different level of sensitivity to pseudomonic acid. This finding explains why it was difficult to determine K i of the crude extract.Fig. 2Elution profile of aminoacylation activity of P. fluorescens IleRS-R1 and IleRS-R2 by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. S100 supernatant of P. fluorescens cell extract was applied to a column of DEAE-Sephacel, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of KCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” IleRS activities in the absence (white circles) or in the presence of 20 μm pseudomonic acid (red circles) are indicated by arrowheads.

These sequences, “D(C/V)WF(E/D)SG” and “Q(T/H/Y)RGWF”, are adjacent to the region of the KMSKS sequence (Fig. 5). PCR fragments of ∼130 bp, amplified with these primers from P. fluorescens genomic DNA, were cloned and sequenced. In several clones we found a DNA sequence homologous to the ileS gene, which was 52% identical to the corresponding segment of P. fluorescens ileS1. To our surprise, it was clear that the peptide predicted from the DNA sequence shared some eukaryote-specific sequences conserved among eukaryotic IleRSs (17Sassanfar M. Kranz J.E. Gallant P. Schimmel P. Shiba K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9995-10003Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). By using the radiolabeled PCR fragment as a probe, Southern blot hybridization against digested P. fluorescens DNA and cloning of the full-length ileS2 gene were performed. The probe hybridized to an ∼8.5-kb EcoRI fragment by Southern blot analysis (data not shown).

Unlike Taz1 (a similar hybrid with the Tar linker), Tez1 could not respond to Tar ligand, aspartate, whereas single Ala insertion at the transmembrane/linker junction, as seen in Tez1A1, restored the aspartate-regulatable phenotype. Analysis of the Ala insertion site requirement and the nature of the insertion residue on the phenotype of Tez1 indicated that a junction region between the transmembrane domain and the predicted helix I in the linker is critical to signal transduction. Random mutagenesis revealed that P185Q mutation in the Tez1 linker restored the aspartate-regulatable phenotype. Substitution mutations at Pro-185 further demonstrated that specific residues are required at this site for an aspartate response. None of the hybrid receptors constructed with different Tar/EnvZ fusion sites in the linker could respond to aspartate, suggesting that specific interactions between the two predicted helices in the linker are important for the linker function. In addition, a mutation (F220D) known to cause an OmpCc phenotype in EnvZ resulted in similar OmpCc phenotypes in both Tez1A1 and Tez1, indicating the importance of the predicted helix II in signal propagation. Together, we propose that the N-terminal junction region modulates the alignment between the two helices in the linker upon signal input.

EnvZ, a histidine kinase osmosensor, locates on the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. It is composed of a periplasmic domain, transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic domain (1Forst S. Comeau D.

Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2003: 25-46Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic domain has been further dissected into three subdomains, the linker region, domain A, and domain B, in which the latter two form the catalytic core of EnvZ, harboring both kinase and phosphatase functions (3Park H. Saha S.K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6728-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NMR structures of both domain A and domain B have been solved (4Tanaka T. Saha S.K.

Biochemical analysis has revealed that the domain A of the EnvZ is responsible for the dimerization, phosphotransfer and phosphatase functions, and domain B binds ATP and catalytically assists the enzymatic function of domain A (3Park H. Saha S.K. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6728-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Zhu Y. Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Qin L. Yoshida T. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7808-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that EnvZ senses the extracellular osmolarity changes, transmits the signal through its transmembrane domain, and then modulates the kinase/phosphatase ratio of the cytoplasmic catalytic domain, which controls the cellular concentration of phosphorylated OmpR to mediate the reciprocal expression of the two major outer membrane porin proteins OmpF and OmpC (2Inouye M.

Although the exact ligand for EnvZ remains unknown, two kinds of chimeric receptors have been constructed in which the periplasmic and transmembrane domains of chemoreceptor Tar (sensor for aspartate) or Trg (sensor for ribose) are fused with the catalytic core of EnvZ (through the Tar or Trg linker, respectively). The resultant Taz (12Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and Trz (13Baumgartner J.W. Kim C. Brissette R.E. Inouye M. Park C. Hazelbauer G.L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are able to respond to aspartate and ribose in the medium, respectively, to activate ompC-lacZ in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the chemoreceptors and EnvZ share a common signal transduction mechanism. Similar chimeric receptors have also been constructed using the periplasmic and transmembrane domain of Tar and the cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor (14Moe G.R. Bollag G.E. Koshland Jr., D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Manson M.D. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), further supporting a notion that there is a common mechanism widely used by signal transduction across the membrane in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Extensive studies on signal transduction through the transmembrane domain of chemotaxis receptors have been carried out, and various mechanisms have been proposed (16Chervitz S.A. Falke J.J. Proc.

However, it remains unknown how the signal is propagated through the membrane to the cytoplasm. Particularly, it is of great interest how the linker region, a structural element connecting the transmembrane domain with the cytoplasmic signaling domain, propagates signal into the cytoplasm. The linker region (also called HAMP domain) is widely found not only in histidine kinases and chemoreceptors but also in bacterial nucleotidyl cyclases and phosphatases. It is considered to function as a regulatory element in these proteins (22Heinz D.W. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Williams S.B. Stewart V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Even though the linker regions share low primary sequence homology, they have a similar helix-turn-helix fold based on secondary structure prediction. A cysteine-scanning study has indicated that the Tar linker consists of a helix-turn-helix structure (25Butler S.L. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10746-10756Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, no three-dimensional structures have yet been determined for any linker regions. The EnvZ linker is also predicted to contain a helix-turn-helix structure (22Heinz D.W. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) like the Tar linker. A number of mutations that block the osmosensing function of EnvZ have been mapped within the linker, suggesting its important role in signal transduction (26Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Harlocker S.L. Rampersaud A. Yang W.P. Inouye M. J.

(Tokyo). 1992; 111: 707-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Only substitution of hydrophobic residue to charged residue, but not to hydrophobic residue, within the two predicted helices of the linker disturbed normal osmoregulation, suggesting that the amphipathic nature of the helices is important for signal propagation. It is important to note that the effects of the linker mutations on the function of the catalytic domain can be detected only when EnvZ is associated with the membrane (26Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once the cytoplasmic domain of EnvZ is detached from the membrane, the linker mutations no longer affect the catalytic function of EnvZ, indicating that the linker has to be fixed on the membrane to transmit the mutational effects to the catalytic domain. To precisely elucidate the role of the EnvZ linker in signal propagation and the structural basis for its function, here we exchanged the Tar linker in the Taz construct with the EnvZ linker and examined how the linker exchange affects the aspartate-regulated EnvZ function. As shown in Fig. 1A, the sequence alignment between the EnvZ linker and the Tar linker together with the C-terminal regions of the transmembrane domain TM2 indicates that the EnvZ linker starts with one Arg residue, whereas the Tar linker starts with two Arg residues, resulting in an extra Arg residue at the transmembrane/linker junction for the Tar linker than the EnvZ linker. In the newly constructed Tar-EnvZ hybrid protein termed Tez1, the EnvZ linker starting with Arg-180 (the residue number is based on the EnvZ sequence) is fused to the Tar transmembrane domain TM2, ending at Ile-212 (the residue number is based on the Tar sequence). Tez1 could not induce ompC-lacZ in RU1012 cells even in the presence of aspartate. However, the insertion of a single Ala residue at the transmembrane/linker junction, not other regions in the linker, restored the aspartateregulatable signal transduction. In addition, through random mutagenesis we demonstrated that position 185 (the residue number is based on the EnvZ sequence), where a highly conserved Pro residue locates, is important for the linker function. To explore the possible structural basis for proper signal transmitting, we constructed several new Tar-EnvZ hybrids fused at different sites in the linker region. We also examined the effect of the F220D mutation, known to block EnvZ osmosensing, on Tez1 and its variant, Tez1A1. On the basis of the characterization of all these hybrid receptors and their mutants, we propose models as to how signal propagation through the linker region takes place. Strains and Plasmids—Strain RU1012 [MC4100 ara+, Φ (ompC-lacZ) 10–25 ΔenvZ::Kmr] (12Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) was used for in vivo study. Tez1 was constructed by a two-step PCR ligation. The first PCR was carried out with primers SC110 (5′-CGCTACCAGTCGTAATATTG-3′) and 9485 (5′-CGGTTCTGGATACGAATGCCGTACCACGC-3′) using pBR001 (12Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) as template. The second PCR was carried out with primers 9484 (5′-CGTGGTACGGCATTCGTATCCAGAACCGAC-3′) and 8435 (5′-ACGGATCCTGTTAGCGCAGGTAGTCGATAAAC-3′) using pBR002 (12Utsumi R. Brissette R.E. Rampersaud A. Forst S.A. Oosawa K. Inouye M. Science. 1989; 245: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) as template. The third PCR fragment was generated with primers SC110 and 8435 using the first and second PCR products as template. The third PCR product was digested with XbaI and NdeI and subcloned into Taz1, replacing the original XbaI/NdeI fragment. Similarly, Tez5, Tez6, Tez7, Tez8, and Tez9 were constructed with primers SC110 and 9908 (5′-CGCCATACTCACGCAGGTTACCACCGGCGA-3′), 9906 (5′-CAGCGGCGGCGGAATGGCGATTTCGCGAATGTG-3′), 49081 (5′-GGCACGGGTAACGGAGCCCATTTCAGATCTCC-3′), 44739 (5′-AAGGCACGCGTAACGTCGCCCATTTCA-3′), 48432 (5′-GTTAAAGGCACGGGTCAGGTCGCCCATTTC-3′), respectively, for the first PCR and primers 8435 and 9907 (5′-CGCCGGTGGTAACCTGCGTGAGTATGGCGC-3′), 9905 (5′-ATTCGCGAAATCGCCATTCCGCCGCCGCTGC-3′), 49080 (5′-GAGATCTGAAATGGGCTCCGTTACCCGTGCCT-3′), 47738 (5′-TGAAATGGGCGACGTTACGCGTGCCTT-3′), 48431 (5′-GAAATGGGCGACCTGACCCGTGCCTTTAACC-3′) for the second PCR. The third PCR and the following subcloning were carried out as described in Tez1 construction. For the construction of Tez1 variants, an EcoRI restriction site was first introduced at the location corresponding to the C terminus of Tar transmembrane helix TM2 by site-directed mutagenesis without changing the amino acid sequence with the use of primers N64 (5′-GTGGCGTGGTACGGAATTCGTATCCAGA-3′) and N65 (5′-CTGGATACGAATTCCGTACCACCACGCCAC-3′). For constructing Tez1A1, PCR was carried out using primers 50340 (5′-TACGGAATTCGTGCAATCCAGAACCGAC-3′) and 8435. The products were then digested with EcoRI and NdeI and subcloned into Tez1. Similarly, Tez1A2 was constructed using primers 57321 (5′-GGAATTCGTATCCAGAACCGACCGCTAGCAGTCGATCTCGAACACGC-3′) and 8435. Tez1A3 was constructed using primers N64 and 57322 (5′-CAGCCGCCATATGTGCGTTAAAGGCACGGGTAA-3′). Tez1A4 was constructed by two-step PCR as described in Tez1 construction, whereas primers used for first PCR were SC110 and 51039 (5′-GTTCTGGATACGTGCAATTCCGTACCACG-3′), and primers used for second PCR were 51038 (5′-CGTGGTACGGAATTGCACGTATCCAGAACCGAC-3′) and 8435. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to obtain Tez1X mutants with primers 54544 (5′-TACGGAATTCGTNNNATCCAGAACCGAC-3′) and 8435. Mutagenized fragments were digested with EcoRI and NdeI and subcloned into Tez1. For random mutations on the linker region, mutagenesis PCR was carried out using dITP/dNTP mixture and Mn2+ as described previously (31Spee J.H. de Vos W.M. Kuipers O.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) with primers N66 (5′-GTTGCTGAACCAGCCGC-3′) and N64. Mutagenized linker fragments were digested with EcoRI and NdeI and subcloned into Tez1 to replace the wild-type EnvZ linker. Primers 27601 (5′-GTATCCAGAACCGACAGTTGGTCGATCTCG-3′) and 27062 (5′-GAGATCGACCAACTGTCGGTTCTGGATACG-3′) as well as primers 27599 (5′-CGTATCC-AGAACCAACCGTTGGTCGATC-3′) and 27600 (5′-GATCGACCAACGGTTGG-TTCTGGATACGAA-3′) were used in site-directed mutagenesis to separate the two suppressor mutations P185Q (Tez3) and R184Q (Tez4), respectively. Primers 26473 (5′-CGTATCCAGAACCGANNNTTGGTCGATCTCGAA-3′) and 26474 (5′-TCGAGATCGACCAANNNTCGGTTCTGGATACG-3′) were used for constructing Tez1P185X mutants by site-directed mutagenesis using Tez1 as template. Note that the residue numbers used are based on the EnvZ sequence. Preparation of the Membrane Fraction—Membrane fractions containing Taz1, Tez1, or Tez1 variants were prepared as described previously (9Jin T. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 484-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The protein amounts were determined by Bio-Rad protein assay. Western blot analysis was carried out using an equal amount of total membrane proteins (3 μg). Autophosphorylation and OmpR Kinase Assay—Membrane fractions containing receptor proteins (5 μg) were incubated at room temperature in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci·mmol–1, 10 mCi·ml–1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Ten-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture at 2 and 15 min, and the reactions were stopped by adding 2.5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer. In the remaining reaction mixture, OmpR was added to a final concentration of 2 μm. Ten-μl aliquots were removed at 5 and 10 min, and reactions were stopped as described above. All reaction mixtures were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. β-Galactosidase Assay—β-Galactosidase activities of RU1012 cells transformed with various Taz1 or Tez1 constructs were determined as described previously (32Yang Y. Inouye M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Screening for Intragenic Suppressor—Tez1 constructs harboring randomly mutagenized linker sequence were transformed into RU1012 cells. The screening for aspartate-regulatable constructs was carried out as described previously (33Zhu Y. Inouye M. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Through this screening only one candidate (Tez2) was obtained. After confirming its phenotype by retransforming the mutated plasmid into RU1012 cells, the linker region of this plasmid was sequenced to identify the suppressor mutation. Tez1 Cannot Respond to Aspartate, the Ligand for Tar—To precisely examine the role of the linker region of EnvZ in signal transduction, we replaced the Tar linker (44 residues) in the Taz1 receptor with the EnvZ linker (43 residues) to construct a new hybrid protein termed Tez1, based on the assumption that the two linkers share a similar mechanism for signal propagation. In Tez1, the EnvZ linker was connected directly to the C-terminal end of the Tar transmembrane domain TM2 (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, Tez1 could not respond to aspartate and resulted in an OmpC-constitutive repression phenotype (OmpC–) in RU1012 cells. Two possible reasons may account for this phenotype; (i) the linker replacement might compromise the stability of the receptor protein, since the lack of an aspartate receptor in the membrane is expected to result in the OmpC– phenotype even in the presence of aspartate, or (ii) the EnvZ linker is unable to transmit the input signal to the downstream catalytic domain, and thus, cells are unable to increase the OmpR-P concentration by increasing the kinase/phosphatase ratio of the catalytic domain. To test these possibilities, Western blot analysis of the membrane fractions from RU1012 cells harboring either Tez1 or Taz1 construct was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1C, Tez1 receptor could be expressed and localized in the membrane to a similar level as Taz1 receptor. Using the same membrane fractions containing Tez1 or Taz1 to check the autokinase and OmpR kinase functions of the two receptors, we found that Tez1, like Taz1, retained the enzymatic activities (Fig. 1D). The catalytic domain of EnvZ in the Tez1 receptor could autophosphorylate itself (lanes 1 and 2) and subsequently transfer the phosphoryl group to the OmpR (lanes 3 and 4) as that in Taz1 (lanes 5 and 6 for autophosphorylation; lanes 7 and 8 for phosphotransfer). These results suggest that the catalytic domain still retains its enzymatic functions but is unable to properly regulate the kinase/phosphatase ratio. Because the EnvZ linker in the intact EnvZ can propagate the osmolarity signal but not in Tez1, we speculate that a proper connection between the transmembrane domain and the linker region is essential to normal signal transduction. Adjustment of the Transmembrane/Linker Junction in Tez1—The Tar transmembrane domain TM2 is presumed to consist of an α-helix structure (for review, see Ref. 17Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The addition or deletion of an amino acid residue(s) at the transmembrane/linker junction may change the relative orientation of the EnvZ cytoplasmic domain to the Tar transmembrane domain through altering the conformation of the linker region, which in turn recovers the aspartate-regulatable OmpC expression in RU1012 cells. Therefore, we constructed three new Tez1 hybrid receptors, Tez1A1, Tez1ΔI181, and Tez1AA. In Tez1A1, one Ala residue was inserted immediately downstream of the membrane interface residue Arg-180; in Tez1ΔI181, Ile-181 residue was deleted; and in Tez1AA, two Ala residues were inserted after the 180 residue (Fig. 2A). Note that at here and later sections, all the residue numbers used are based on the EnvZ sequence. As shown in Fig. 2B, Tez1A1 in RU1012 cells exhibited aspartate-regulatable β-galactosidase induction, as the expression of ompC-lacZ was well correlated to the medium aspartate concentration. In contrast, Tez1ΔI181 and Tez1AA could not respond to aspartate and displayed an OmpC– and an OmpCc phenotype, respectively. All three receptors were expressed and localized in the membrane fraction at a similar level as Tez1 and retained enzymatic activities (data not shown). These results indicate that the length adjustment at the transmembrane/linker junction is crucial for the proper signal transduction from the transmembrane domain to the cytoplasmic domain. Specificity of Amino Acid Insertion after Arg-180 —To further examine how the Ala residue inserted in Tez1A1 plays a specific role in signal transduction, random amino acid insertion was carried out after Arg-180 to construct Tez1X. Of 15 different residues introduced at this position, only Asp and Asn in addition to Ala residue were able to resume the aspartateregulatable regulation of ompC-lacZ in RU1012 cells as shown in Fig. 3. Notably, β-galactosidase activities in the absence of aspartate were quite high in the case of Asp and Asn residue insertion in contrast to Tez1A1. Amino acid residues such as Leu, which are preferred in helix formation, were not able to recover the aspartate-regulatable phenotype, suggesting that the Ala residue insertion after Arg-180 is not simply extending a helical structure through the TM2 transmembrane domain. Most interestingly, the Tez1R construct, in which the EnvZ linker starts with Arg-Arg as the Tar linker and also contains 44 amino acid residues, exhibited an OmpCc phenotype. The fact that the residues to be inserted at the transmembrane/linker junction are very selective indicates possible conformational requirements at the junction region for proper signal propagation. Effects of an Ala Residue Insertion at Different Sites in the Linker—Next we examined whether length adjustment at other regions in the linker could recover aspartate-regulatable phenotype as seen in Tez1A1. Ala residues were inserted at three different positions (Tez1A2, Tez1A3, and Tez1A4) (Fig. 4A). In Tez1A2, an Ala residue was inserted in the predicted helix I, 7 amino acid residues downstream of the Tez1A1 fusion site, whereas in Tez1A3 an Ala residue was inserted in the predicted helix II. Note that according to the secondary structure prediction, helix II continues further into N-terminal end of the EnvZ catalytic domain A (22Heinz D.W. Essen L.O. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 635-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 176: 111-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Tez1A4, an Ala residue was inserted immediately upstream of Arg-180. β-Galactosidase assays using RU1012 cells harboring these Tez1A variants showed that Tez1A2 and Tez1A3 exhibited an OmpCc phenotype even in the absence of aspartate, whereas Tez1A4 maintained an aspartate-regulatable phenotype as Tez1A1 (Fig. 4B). This suggests that the length adjustment in the linker for recovering signaling has to be at the transmembrane/linker junction. The phenotypes of Tez1A2 and Tez1A3 also suggest that the helical orientations of the predicted two helices, helix I and helix II, play important roles in the linker function. Important Role of Pro-185 in Signal Transduction—To check whether any amino acid substitution mutations within the linker are able to achieve the same effect as the Ala insertion in Tez1A1 for aspartate-regulatable phenotype, PCR random mutagenesis was carried out on the entire linker region as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After subcloning the mutagenized linker fragments of EnvZ (Arg-180 to His-222) back into the Tez1 construct, we transformed the plasmids into the RU1012 cells and plated the transformed cells on lactose-MacConkey plates containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 5 mm aspartate. Subsequently, red colonies were picked to further test if their β-galactosidase activities were regulatable by aspartate. Of more than 1500 red colonies, only one such mutant was found, which was termed Tez2. We confirmed the phenotype of Tez2 by extracting the plasmid from the cells, retransforming it back to the RU1012 cells, and assaying the β-galactosidase activities in the absence and presence of 5 mm aspartate. The β-galactosidase activity of Tez2 in the absence of aspartate is a little higher than that of Tez1A1; however, in the presence of 5 mm aspartate, β-galactosidase induction of Tez2 was almost as high as that of Tez1A1 (Fig. 5A). When the Tez2 linker region was sequenced, it was found to contain two amino acid substitutions, R184Q and P185Q. The two mutations were separated by site-directed mutagensis, and their individual phenotypes were examined. As shown in Fig. 5A, P185Q mutation (Tez3) alone could suppress the Tez1 phenotype and recover an aspartate-regulatable phenotype. On the other hand, the R184Q mutation (Tez4) was unable to suppress the Tez1 phenotype. Interestingly, when an Ala residue was inserted after Arg-180 in Tez3, as seen in Tez1A1, the resultant Tez3A was still able to show an aspartate-regulatable phenotype (Fig. 5A), indicating that the P185Q mutation overrides or bypasses the length effect of the junction region or vice versa. To further demonstrate the importance of position 185 in signal transduction, we carried out random mutagenesis at this location. As shown in Fig. 5B, three different phenotypes were observed depending on the identity of the amino acid substituted; that is, aspartate-regulatable (Glu and Ile), partially regulatable (Asn and Leu), or non-regulatable (Arg, Ser, Asp, and Ala). Western blot analysis demonstrated that all mutant proteins were expressed and localized in the membrane fractions at a similar level as Tez1 with the exception of Pro to Ser mutation, which resulted in about a 50% reduction in expression (data not shown). All the mutant proteins also retained enzymatic activities (data not shown). These data demonstrate that position 185 plays a critical role in the EnvZ linker function. It should be noted that Pro-185 is one of the most conserved residues within the linker in all chemoreceptors and many histidine kinases in E. coli (23Aravind L. Ponting C.P. FEMS Microbiol.

We examined the hypothesis that Ser36, Ser330, Ser354, and Ser454, contained in a protein kinase C sequence motif in CTP synthetase, were target sites for the kinase. Synthetic peptides containing a phosphorylation motif at these serine residues served as substrates for protein kinase C in vitro. Ser → Ala (S36A, S330A, S354A, and S454A) mutations in CTP synthetase were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed normally in a ura7 ura8 double mutant that lacks CTP synthetase activity. The CTP synthetase activity in extracts from cells bearing the S36A, S354A, and S454A mutant enzymes was reduced when compared with cells bearing the wild type enzyme. Kinetic analysis of purified mutant enzymes showed that the S36A and S354A mutations caused a decrease in the Vmax of the reaction. This regulation could be attributed in part by the effects phosphorylation has on the nucleotide-dependent oligomerization of CTP synthetase. In contrast, CTP synthetase activity in cells bearing the S330A mutant enzyme was elevated, and kinetic analysis of purified enzyme showed that the S330A mutation caused an elevation in the Vmax of the reaction. In vitro data indicated that phosphorylation of CTP synthetase at Ser330 affected the phosphorylation of the enzyme at another site. The phosphorylation of CTP synthetase at Ser36, Ser330, Ser354, and Ser454 residues was physiologically relevant. Cells bearing the S36A, S354A, and S454A mutations had reduced CTP levels, whereas cells with the S330A mutation had elevated CTP levels.

CTP synthetase is an indispensable enzyme because its reaction product CTP is essential for the synthesis of nucleic acids and membrane phospholipids (18Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H.

Like many enzymes involved in macro-molecular synthesis, CTP synthetase is regulated by growth phase. CTP synthetase mRNA and protein levels are highest in the exponential phase of growth and decline as cells enter the stationary phase (28Nadkarni A.K. McDonough V.M. Yang W.-L. Stukey J.E. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24982-24988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CTP synthetase activity is allosterically regulated by its substrates and product CTP. The enzyme exhibits positive cooperative kinetics with respect to UTP and ATP and negative cooperative kinetics with respect to glutamine and GTP (5Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O.

The positive cooperative kinetics of the URA7-encoded enzyme with respect to UTP and ATP are due to the nucleotide-dependent oligomerization of an inactive dimeric form to an active tetrameric form of the enzyme (29Pappas A. Yang W.-L. Park T.-S. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15954-15960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A major form of CTP synthetase regulation is mediated by CTP product inhibition (5Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M.

CTP inhibits CTP synthetase activity by increasing the positive cooperativity of the enzyme for UTP (5Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Amino acid residue Glu161 has been identified as being involved in this regulation (see Fig. 1) (30Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is a major mechanism by which enzymes are regulated (31Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1979; 48: 923-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar), and indeed, the yeast CTP synthetase is regulated by phosphorylation. The URA7-encoded CTP synthetase is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues in vivo (33Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

In this study we examined the hypothesis that amino acid residues Ser36, Ser330, Ser354, and Ser454 within a protein kinase C phosphorylation motif in the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase are target sites of phosphorylation (Fig. 1). We showed that S36A, S330A, S354A, and S454A mutant CTP synthetase enzymes exhibited alterations in their catalytic properties and that cells carrying the mutant enzymes exhibited alterations in the cellular levels of CTP and in the synthesis of the membrane phospholipid PC. 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: PC, phosphatidylcholine; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Constructions of Plasmids—The codons for Ser36, Ser330, Ser354, and Ser454 in the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase were changed to alanine codons by site-directed mutagenesis.

Plasmid pDO178 contains the URA7 coding sequence in pBlueScript II (30Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

The lowercase letters in the primers refer to nonhomologous sequences used for mutagenesis or for incorporating restriction enzyme sites. The primers for the S36A mutation incorporated a BstEII restriction site, and the primers for the S330A and S454A mutations incorporated a BsrDI site. These silent mutations were used to identify the plasmids with correct mutations by restriction enzyme analysis. Plasmids with the S354A mutation were verified by DNA sequencing. All of the mutant alleles were completely sequenced to verify that no additional mutations were made. The wild type and mutant alleles of URA7 were released from the plasmids by digestion with NotI/PstI. These 1.8-kilobase fragments of the URA7-encoding sequences were inserted into the same restriction enzyme sites of multicopy plasmid pDO105 in which the expression of URA7 was under the control of the ADH1 promoter (30Ostrander D.B. O'Brien D.J. Gorman J.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18992-19001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The same wild type and mutant allele fragments were inserted into single copy plasmid pDO120 containing the ADH1 promoter. Plasmid pDO120 was constructed by subcloning the 1.58-kilobase EcoRI/PstI fragment of pDO105 into the single copy plasmid YCpLac111 (43Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar). Strain SDO195, bearing pFL44S-URA7 (7Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen.

Plasmid pFL44S-URA7 was subsequently selected against 5-fluroorotic acid by plasmid shuffle (44Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). Cells were then examined to verify that they regained uracil auxotrophy. To verify the presence of the ADH1 expression vectors containing the wild type and mutant alleles of URA7, plasmids were rescued from yeast, amplified in E. coli, and subjected to restriction enzyme analysis. We used the ADH1 promoter for enzyme expression to preclude regulation mediated by the native URA7 promoter. The single copy plasmid was used to approximate normal expression of the enzymes and to examine the effects of the mutations in growing cells. The multicopy plasmid was used to overexpress CTP synthetase for enzyme purification. The mutant and wild type alleles were expressed on multicopy and single copy plasmids in the ura7 ura8 double mutant to avoid effects due to the native URA7- and URA8-encoded enzymes. In Vivo Labeling of CTP Synthetase—Cells bearing single copy plasmids containing the wild type and the S36A, S330A, S354A, and S454A mutant URA7 alleles were used to examine the phosphorylation state of CTP synthetase. Exponential phase cells grown in YEPD medium were labeled in low phosphate medium (45Warner J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) with 32Pi (0.3 mCi/ml) and U-14C-labeled l amino acids (5 μCi/ml) for 3 h. Labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were disrupted with glass beads in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (46Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm NaF, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). CTP synthetase was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate with anti-URA7-encoded CTP synthetase IgG antibodies (5Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as described previously (46Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was dissociated from the enzyme-antibody complex (46Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), and the amount of radiolabel incorporated into the enzyme was determined by scintillation counting. Purification of Wild Type and Mutant CTP Synthetases—Cells overexpressing the wild type and mutant CTP synthetases were used for enzyme purification. The enzymes were purified by a modification of the method described by Yang et al. (5Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. Cells (10 g wet weight) were disrupted with glass beads with a Bead-Beater in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm l-glutamine, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 5 mg/ml aprotinin, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mg/ml pepstatin) as described previously (47Fischl A.S. Carman G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 304-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unbroken cells and glass beads were removed by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 5 min. The cytosol was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1.5 h and diluted to a final protein concentration of 4.5 mg/ml with buffer A. Enzyme-grade ammonium sulfate was added to the cytosol to 45% saturation with slow stirring. After stirring for 2 h, precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min and dissolved in a minimum volume of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol). The ammonium sulfate fraction was applied to a Superose 6 column (1 × 24 cm) that was equilibrated with buffer B. CTP synthetase was eluted from the column in 0.5-ml fractions with buffer B at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. This step served to desalt the preparation and to enrich for the CTP synthetase enzyme. The most active fractions were pooled and applied to a Mono Q column (0.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer B followed by elution of CTP synthetase in 1-ml fractions with 50 column volumes of a linear NaCl gradient (0–1.5 m) in buffer B. The peak of CTP synthetase activity eluted from the column at a NaCl concentration of about 0.3 m. The active fractions were stored at –80 °C in buffer B with the glycerol concentration raised to 25%. The enzyme preparations were stable for at least 6 months when stored at –80 °C. For peptide-mapping analyses, the wild type and mutant CTP synthetases were purified to electrophoretic homoge"

Consistent with reports of native <i>Lymnaea</i> calcium currents, the LCa<sub>v</sub>2a-5′rbA channel is insensitive to micromolar concentrations of ω-conotoxin GVIA and is not affected by nifedipine, thus confirming that it is not of the L-type.

Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 1The abbreviations used are: ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; Orn, ornithine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; put, putrescine; AZ, antizyme; DFMO, α-difluoromethylornithine; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines, the decarboxylation of l-Orn to form the diamine putrescine (1Tabor C.W. Tabor H. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 81-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyamines are required for cell proliferation. α-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a suicide inhibitor of ODC, is an approved drug for the treatment of African sleeping sickness caused by the parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei (2Wang C.C.

It has also been investigated as a potential drug for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative diseases (reviewed in Refs. 4Pegg A.E. Shantz L.M. Coleman C.S. J.

Biol. 2000; 295: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) demonstrates that the ODC monomer consists of two domains, an N-terminal β/α-barrel domain and a C-terminal β-sheet domain. The T. brucei structure has also been solved in complex with the product putrescine and with DFMO, identifying important active site residues (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). ODC is an obligate homodimer, and the two identical active sites are formed at the dimer interface, encompassing the β/α–barrel domain from one subunit and β–sheet domain from the other. Catalytic residues are contributed to the active site from both monomers. Both putrescine and DFMO form a covalent Schiff base complex with the PLP cofactor, and the side-chain amino groups of both compounds bind in a well conserved pocket that bridges between subunits. In addition DFMO has undergone decarboxylation and has formed a covalent bond to Cys-360 as expected based on its mechanism of inhibition (10Poulin R. Lu L. Ackerman B. Bey P. Pegg A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 150-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ODC active site is invariant between the host and parasite enzymes; thus, selective toxicity of DFMO for the parasite is not achieved through differential inhibitor binding to the enzyme active site (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Instead, it is thought to arise from metabolic differences between the host and parasite, which include the rapid turnover of host ODC when compared with that of the parasite (2Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 93-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Phillips M.A. Coffino P. Wang C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8721-8727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the requirement for the polyamine spermidine for the formation of the novel cofactor trypanothione to maintain reduced thiol pools in the parasite (12Fairlamb A.H. Le Quesne S.A. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis. CAB International, Wallingford, Oxon, United Kingdom1997: 149-161Google Scholar). The discovery that DFMO was curative against T. brucei gambiense infections provided the first alternative to the highly toxic melarsoprol for the treatment of late stage disease (13Bacchi C.J. Nathan H.C. Hunter S.H. Science. 1980; 210: 332-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, utilization of DFMO is hampered by the large dose requirement and by poor activity against the T. brucei rhodesiense strain of the parasite (2Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 93-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of small molecule inhibitors of ODC have been reported, but like DFMO they target the highly conserved active site (14Danzen C. Casasra P. Claverie N. Metcalf B.W. J. Med. Chem. 1981; 24: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 15Bey P. Danzin C. Dorsselaer V. Mamont P. Jung M. Tardif C. J. Med.

Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The discovery of novel ODC inhibitors with chemical properties that differ from substrate may overcome the poor pharmacology of DFMO. We had observed previously (17Myers D.P. Jackson L.K. Ipe V.G. Murphy G.E. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13230-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that mutations in the dimer interface of ODC distant from the active site decreased catalytic activity. Thus we sought to explore whether ODC could be inhibited allosterically by binding inhibitors to sites outside of the active site. We have identified an inhibitor of ODC, G418 sulfate (Geneticin), which is non-competitive with substrate. Although the inhibitor has a high KI (5–8 mm) it was sufficiently inhibitory to allow us to observe d-Orn bound in the active site of ODC. Previous attempts to co-crystallize d-Orn and ODC were unsuccessful, because the substrate analog was unexpectedly decarboxylated to putrescine (8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Through crystallographic analysis of T. brucei ODC, G418, and d-Orn, we have determined the binding orientation of a carboxylated ligand. The structure reported here, in combination with the DFMO-bound structure and with mutagenic analysis, supports a model where the substrate carboxylate is buried on the re face of PLP on the same face as Lys-69. The inhibitor G418 binds outside the active site of ODC in the interface between the two domains of the ODC monomer. A loop region (residues 392–401) at the symmetry-related center of the dimer interface, which contributes essential residues to the active site pocket, is disordered in this structure. The disorder in this region of the active site may explain the basis for inhibition of ODC by G418. This conformation, apparently available at low energy, is inactive and could be useful in inhibitor design. G418 sulfate (Geneticin) was purchased from Invitrogen (catalogue numbers 55-0273 and 11811-023), and Cytoscint was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. ODC Expression and Purification—ODC was expressed from a T7 promoter in the BL21 (DE3) strain of Escherichia coli as described for T. brucei (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B.

The protein was produced as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion that included a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site to allow removal of the tag. Protein was purified by column chromatography over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and Sephadex 200. For crystallography, the His tag was removed from purified ODC by digestion with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads as described (19Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Proteins. 1996; 24: 272-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The purified protein for crystallization experiments was concentrated to 20–25 mg/ml. Site-directed Mutagenesis—D243A, L339A, and E384A mutants of T. brucei ODC were created using PCR-based mutagenesis of the pODC29 expression plasmid using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The primers listed below contain the desired mutation (bold), and D243A and L339A also contain silent mutations (bold italics), which remove a restriction site (BseDI and StuI, respectively) for diagnostic purposes: L339A forward, 5′-GACCACGCAGTCGTCAGACCTGCGCCCCAGAGGGAGCC-3′; D243A forward, 5′-GTGGGTTTCCAGGTACGAGGGCTGCACCACTTAAATTTG3′; E384A forward, 5′-GGCTGCTCTTTGCGGATATGGGTGCC-3′. Inhibitor Identification—G418 and other aminoglycosides were identified as potential ODC inhibitors by computational methods using the Available Chemicals Directory (1998 version). Enzyme Assays—Steady-state spectrophotometric assay of the decarboxylation of l-Orn (0.1 to 16 mm) by ODC (20–80 nm) was followed at 37 °C as described (18Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using the Sigma Diagnostics carbon dioxide detection kit (Sigma) in the presence of 50 μm PLP. In this assay CO2 production is linked to the oxidation of NADH (λmax·NADH = 340 nm) by coupling the ODC reaction to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase. Direct assay of l-Orn decarboxylation by ODC was performed by a radioactive assay of 1-14C-l-Orn. For this assay, a 2× substrate solution, 1-14C-l-Orn (32 μm) mixed with cold l-Orn (0.8 mm) in Buffer A (0.2 m Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.05 mm PLP), was added to a culture tube by injection with a Hamilton syringe through a rubber stopper cap into a 2× ODC enzyme solution (0.25 μm ODC in Buffer A). After mixing, the reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for varied times (0 to 8 min) and then quenched with 20% (final) trichloroacetic acid. Sample chambers were incubated for another hour at 37 °C to evolve liberated 1-14CO2 onto paper strips soaked with a saturated Ba(OH)2 solution that were hung in the chamber. The paper strips were submerged in Cytoscint scintillation mixture and counted for radioactive decay. The KI and IC50 values for the inhibition of ODC by G418 sulfate were determined by spectroscopic assay over a range of inhibitor concentrations (0–16 mm). The inhibitors (at 1×) were preincubated with ODC (at 50×) in assay buffer for 15 min at 37 °C before addition to the assay mixture. The assay mixture was also allowed to pre-incubate for 5 min with G418 before the addition of pre-incubated enzyme. Salt controls (NaCl and KSO4) were run in the same concentration range as inhibitor. IC50 values were determined by fitting to Equation 1.νiνo=11+[I]IC50(Eq. 1) The KI values were determined by varying both l-Orn and inhibitor concentration, and KI values for the non-competitive inhibitors were determined by fitting to Equation 2.ν=Vmax[S](Km+[S])(1+[1]KI)(Eq. 2) Kinetic data were fitted to the appropriate equation with Sigma Plot 2001 version 7.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) to determine the kinetic constants. Crystallization—T. brucei ODC was co-crystallized with d-Orn and G418 sulfate under the following conditions: T. brucei ODC (23 mg/ml in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij-20) was preincubated with 25 mm d-Orn and 100 mm G418 sulfate for 10 min at room temperature before setting crystal drops. Equal volumes of preincubated enzyme and well solution (20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm d-Orn, pH 7.5, 100 mm G418) were used to form the crystal drops. γ-Butyrolactone, 3% (v/v) final, was added to the drops (final pH = 7.0). The crystals formed overnight at 16 °C under conditions of vapor diffusion. Crystals were cryoprotected in 1.2 × crystal conditions with 20% ethylene glycol and frozen in propane. These conditions differed from those used previously (8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) to obtain the putrescine bound structure in which the γ-butyrolactone additive was not required, and the well solution contained NaOAc in place of G418 (20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 mm d-Orn, 200 mm NaOAc). Data Collection and Processing—Diffraction data were collected with an R-Axis IV image plate system (MSC, Houston, TX) mounted on a rotating anode and operated at 100 mA and 50 kV, at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Data were processed with HKL2000 (20Otwinoski A. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38572) Google Scholar). A summary of the statistics for data processing is given in Table I. There was a slight asymmetry in the resolution of the data and also a telescoping effect in the spot shape. After screening many crystals, data adequate for structure determination were collected. Wilson B-values were determined using CCP4 (21Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Cryst. Sect.

The model was built in O version 6.2.2 (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Cryst. Sect.

Non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were kept for residues 38–152, 170–291, and 317–390 for initial rounds of refinement, non-crystallographic symmetry constraints were released for one round, and then restraints were added again for residues 38–152, 170–238, 247–291, 317–340, and 350–390 for the remainder of the refinement. The peptide torsion angles for 1011 of 1180 non-glycine and non-proline residues fall within the most favored regions, and there are none found in disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as determined by the program PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Water molecules were added using CNS and edited in the program O. Refinement statistics are listed in Table I. The coordinates have been placed in the Protein Data Bank (Protein Data Bank code 1NJJ). Superposition of Crystal Structures and Determination of r.m.s.d. between Structure Coordinates—C monomers from each of the following T. brucei ODC structures, native ODC (Protein Data Bank code 1QU4; native_ODC), K69A ODC inactivated with DFMO (Protein Data Bank code 2tod; K69_ODC/DFMO), and the structure reported in this paper (ODC/G418/d-Orn), were superimposed with the structure of ODC in complex with putrescine (Protein Data Bank code 1f3t; ODC/put) using Insight II (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Monomers from each structure were pared down to include only shared residues 37–68, 70–157, 168–296, 312–344, 348–391, and 402–409, and backbone atoms from residues 320–340 and 350–380 (from the β-sheet domain) were superimposed. Superimposed monomers were written out into the same coordinate system using the Biopolymer module of InsightII, and CNS was used to determine the average r.m.s. coordinate difference between structures for residues 45–282 (from the βα-barrel domain) and for residues in the β-sheet domain (38–44, 283–342, and 349–409), using the CNS rmsd.inp input file. Analysis of the Inhibition of T. brucei ODC Activity by G418 Sulfate—G418 sulfate is a weak non-competitive inhibitor of ODC with respect to l-Orn. G418 has a KI of8mm at pH 7.0 and 4.5 mm at pH 8.0. Pre-incubation of ODC with G418 to establish equilibrium before assaying for activity was required to observe constant inhibition suggesting a slow binding step or a slow conformational change promoted by G418. Inhibition was observed using both the enzyme-linked and the direct, radioactive decarboxylation assays. Because primary amines are able to form a Schiff base with the PLP cofactor, the observed noncompetitive inhibition could result from to the sequestration of PLP by the high concentration of G418 (an amine) used. To test for this possibility, we assayed for inhibition over a range of PLP concentrations (10–200 μm), and the inhibition remained constant, suggesting that PLP sequestration is not the mechanism of inhibition. Controls containing equivalent concentrations of the inhibitor counter ions (NaCl or KSO4) were also performed. No inhibition was seen under these conditions. Similar results for inhibition of human ODC by G418 were obtained. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—T. brucei ODC was co-crystallized with d-Orn and G418. The ODC/G418/d-Orn crystal diffracted to 2.45 Å in the space group P21 (a = 67.8 Å, b = 88.5 Å, c = 150.4 Å, β = 90.03°) with two homodimers in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains four monomers, 1404 residues, four PLP, four d-Orn, three G418, and 207 water molecules. The R-factor is 26.0% with an Rfree of 28.3% for data between 35- and 2.45-Å resolution (Table I). Representative electron density for the PLP/d-Orn and G418 binding sites is displayed in Fig. 1. Density for most of the structure was unambiguous with the exception that residues at the N terminus (amino acid residues 1–19), the C terminus (410–425), and three surface loops (31–36, 158–167, and 297–311) were disordered. Residues 343–348 have poorly defined density as observed previously (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) for all T. brucei ODC structures. Chain specific differences include the following: chain A has an additional six residues (410–414) at the C terminus, chain C contains density for additional residues at the N-terminal end (14Danzen C.

In addition to those regions typically disordered in T. brucei ODC crystals, residues Val-392 to Gln-401, near the active site, were also disordered in the ODC/G418/d-Orn structure (Fig. 2). These residues were well ordered in the previous crystallographic studies of T. brucei ODC with B-factors in the region being comparable with the average B-factor for the overall structure (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Residues 392–401 are in the dimer interface, adjacent to the equivalent loop from the opposing monomer, and contribute residues that form the back of the active site pocket (Fig. 3A). Several of these residues (Phe-397, Asn-398, and Phe-400) have been demonstrated to be important for enzyme activity (17Myers D.P. Jackson L.K. Ipe V.G. Murphy G.E. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13230-13236Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Myers D.P. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2933-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Although the space group is the same as with previous T. brucei ODC structures (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the lattice and packing differ. Neither the inhibitor binding site nor the disordered loop appear to be influenced by the lattice.Fig. 3Stereo views of the d-Orn binding site.A, selected active site residues from the ODC/G418/d-Orn structure (blue carbon atoms) are superimposed with corresponding residues from the ODC/put structure (green carbon atoms) (Protein Data Bank code 1f3t).

Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Jackson L.K. Abbott J.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11814-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). During kinetic analysis, d-Orn is not decarboxylated at a detectable rate (kcat/Km < 1 × 10–6 s–1m–1 at 37 °C). However, during the extensive incubation between d-Orn and wild-type T. brucei ODC required for crystallization, d-Orn is converted to putrescine, as observed in the ODC/put structure (8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, in the ODC/G418/d-Orn structure, density for the carboxylate is observed (Fig. 1A). The d-Orn carboxyl group is positioned on the si face of the PLP cofactor, on the solvent-exposed face of the active site (see Fig. 1A and Fig. 3B). Gly-199, Gly-362, and the His-197 side chains are the only contacts within 4.2 Å of the d-Orn carboxyl group. d-Orn forms an external aldimine with the PLP cofactor, and the δ-amino group interacts with Asp-361 and Asp-332 (Fig. 3A). The position for the d-Orn δ-amino group is similar to that observed for ligands in the putrescine and DFMO complexed ODC structures (7Grishin N.V. Osterman A.L. Brooks H.B. Phillips M.A. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15174-15184Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Lys-69, which forms a Schiff base with PLP in the unliganded structure, has rotated out of the active site to form interactions with Asp-88 and Glu-94, as observed in the structure of T. brucei ODC bound to putrescine (8Jackson L.K. Brooks H.B. Osterman A.L. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11247-11257Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Differences in the active site structure are also observed. In previous structures residues 158–165, which are located near the active site entrance, are disordered. In addition to these residues, Leu-166 becomes disordered in this structure, apparently displaced by the carboxylate of d-Orn. Cys-360 is also observed in a different position than for previo"

We have studied the human homologue of CLK-2 (hCLK2) to determine whether it affects the same set of cellular features as CLK-2. We find that overexpression of hCLK2 decreases cell cycle length and that inhibition of hCLK2 expression arrests the cell cycle reversibly. Overexpression of hCLK2, however, renders the cell hypersensitive to apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress or DNA replication block and gradually increases telomere length. The evolutionary conservation of the pattern of cellular functions affected by CLK-2 suggests that the function of hCLK2 in humans might also affect the same organismal features as in worms, including life span. Surprisingly, we find that hCLK2 is present in all cellular compartments and exists as a membrane-associated as well as a soluble form.

Surprisingly, we find that hCLK2 is present in all cellular compartments and exists as a membrane-associated as well as a soluble form. Identifying and studying the processes and the genes that are involved in determining the rate of aging is a challenging area of modern genetics. In particular, it would be of interest to determine whether the activity of specific genes limits human life span. Several epidemiological studies of centenarians are being carried out with this goal in mind under the hypothesis that there might be a genetic basis for the exceptional life span of very long lived individuals (1Perls T. Terry D.F. Silver M. Shea M. Bowen J. Joyce E. Ridge S.B. Fretts R. Daly M. Brewster S. Puca A. Kunkel L. Results Probl. Cell Differ. 2000; 29: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, given the pervasive evolutionary conservation of physiological processes among organisms, a practical approach to find genes that might be involved in human aging is to first investigate the genetic basis of aging in lower organisms. The nematode genetic model system, Caenorhabditis elegans, is being extensively used to this end, and a number of genes that have been identified in this organism for their effect on aging are now also being studied in vertebrates (2Hekimi S. Burgess J. Bussiere F. Meng Y. Benard C. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 712-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3Tissenbaum H.A. Guarente L. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The clk-2 mutants of C. elegans display a pleiotropic phenotype (reviewed in Ref. 4Benard C. Hekimi S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that includes a slowing down of numerous physiological processes, including embryonic and postembryonic development, behavioral rates, and reproduction (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). clk-2 mutants also show an increase in life span that is particularly dramatic in combination with mutations in other genes, such as clk-1 and daf-2 (2Hekimi S. Burgess J. Bussiere F. Meng Y. Benard C. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 712-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Science. 1996; 272: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The clk-2 mutations are temperature-sensitive (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ahmed S. Alpi A. Hengartner M.O. Gartner A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1934-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and at 25 °C produce a lethal embryonic phenotype resulting in differentiated but highly disorganized embryos (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is likely to be the null phenotype, since it is also produced by RNA interference at all temperatures. Extensive temperature shift experiments have demonstrated that clk-2 is required for embryonic development only during a narrow time window in which oocyte maturation, fertilization, the completion of meiosis, and the initiation of embryonic development occurs (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these events as well as subsequent embryonic development appear to proceed entirely normally until the 100-cell stage, after which aberrant development becomes apparent. Surprisingly, all clk-2 phenotypes, including the phenotypes observed in adults that are ∼1000 times larger than the eggs produced by the mother, are rescued by a maternal effect; i.e. homozygous mutant animals, issued from a heterozygous mother, appear wild type. This maternal rescue effect suggests that the presence of maternally provided clk-2 product might induce a self-maintained epigenetic state, although the possibility that the maternally provided clk-2 product can still function efficiently after extreme dilution cannot be excluded. A number of cellular phenotypes of clk-2 mutants have also been identified in addition to the organismal phenotypes described above (7Ahmed S. Alpi A. Hengartner M.O. Gartner A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1934-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Gartner A. Milstein S. Ahmed S. Hodgkin J. Hengartner M.O. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For example, the germ lines of clk-2 mutants do not respond normally to ionizing radiation. In the wild type, irradiation leads to cell cycle arrest in the mitotic phase of the germ line and to apoptotic cell death in the meiotic phase of the germ line. Both of these responses are abolished in clk-2 mutants. In addition, clk-2 mutants fail to respond with cell cycle arrest to treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), 1The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling; GST, glutathione S-transferase. a drug that blocks DNA replication, suggesting a defect in the S-phase replication checkpoint. Taken together, these cellular phenotypes suggest that clk-2 mutants are defective in important aspects of the normal cellular response to DNA damage. The C. elegans clk-2 gene encodes a protein of 877 amino acids that is similar to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tel2p and has a unique homologue in every eukaryotic genome sequenced to date (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells carrying the hypomorphic tel2-1 mutation grow slowly and have short telomeres (9Runge K.W. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3094-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The telomeres shorten gradually in the tel2 cells, reaching their shortest lengths only after ∼150 generations. In addition to affecting the length of telomeres, Tel2p has also been shown to be involved in the telomere position effect, contributing to silencing of subtelomeric regions. Mutations in other genes, such as tel1, that also affect telomere length do not result in abnormal telomere position effect, indicating that the telomere position effect defect in tel2 mutants is not a simple consequence of the altered telomere length (10Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast to the viable tel2–1 mutants, cells that fully lack Tel2p die rapidly with an abnormal cell morphology, which suggests that Tel2p also has telomere-independent functions in yeast (9Runge K.W. Zakian V.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3094-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Worm clk-2 mutants also have altered telomere length. In contrast to the phenotype in yeast, clk-2(qm37) mutants have lengthened telomeres, and transgenic expression of clk-2 shortens some telomeres (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although yeast Tel2p can bind single- and double-stranded DNA and RNA under some in vitro conditions (11Kota R.S. Runge K.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1528-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12Kota R.S. Runge K.W. Chromosoma. 1999; 108: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), a functional worm CLK-2::GFP fusion protein accumulates predominantly in the cytoplasm (5Benard C. McCright B. Zhang Y. Felkai S. Lakowski B. Hekimi S. Development. 2001; 128: 4045-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings, together with the broad pleiotropy observed mostly in worms, but also in yeast, suggest that clk-2 and tel2 mutations affect telomere length indirectly. Cell Culture—All cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (plus nonessential medium amino acids for HT-1080 and SK-HEP-1) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Construction of the Plasmid pLXSH-hclk2 and Establishment of a Stable Cell Line Overexpressing hCLK2—A cDNA clone hk02952 (insert size 4337 bp), containing the full-length hclk2 cDNA sequence, as well as parts of intronic sequences (1929–2171, 2288–2456, and 2812–3434) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. Using this cDNA as a template, two fragments that exclude the intron sequences, Δhclk2-A (from bp 256 to 1929) and Δhclk2-B (from bp 1929 to 3434) were generated by PCR and cloned into a pcDNA3.1/V5/His/TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to produce pcDNA3.1-Δhclk2-A and pcDNA3.1-Δhclk2-B. A BamHI-EcoRV fragment from pcDNA3.1-Δhclk2-A(–) was subcloned into the BamHI–HpaI site of pLXSH (13Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) to produce pLXSH-Δhclk2-A. A BamHI fragment from pcDNA3.1-Δhclk2-A(–) was inserted into the BamHI site of pLXSH-Δhclk2-A to produce pLXSH-hclk2. Stable virus-producing cell lines were generated using procedures described previously (14Miller A.D. Miller D.G. Garcia J.V. Lynch C.M.

Selection was performed 48 h after infection in 400 units/ml hygromycin B and continued until colonies were visible. The colonies were pooled and expanded to establish the virus-producing cell lines. Target cells (see Table I) were transduced with the retrovirus as described (16Lochmuller H. Johns T. Shoubridge E.A. Exp.

All surviving cells were kept together as a pool, which constitutes the SK-HEP-1-overexpressing hCLK2 cell line.Table ICell lines infectedName (ATCC No)Tissue derivationHygromycinunits/mlC2C12 (CRL-1772)Mouse myoblast400Rat1-R12 (CRL-2210)Rat fibroblast200A549 (CCL-18S)Human lung carcinoma900SK-N-ASHuman neuroblastoma400SK-HEP-1Human liver adenocarcinoma400HT-1080Human fibrosarcoma400293Human kidney carcinoma400MCH58Human fibroblast100 Open table in a new tab Construction of Plasmid pTRE2-hclk2 and Establishment of a Double Stable Tet-off HT-1080 Line with Inducible hCLK2—The hclk2 full-length cDNA sequence containing engineered NotI and EcoRV sites was generated by PCR and inserted into the NotI–EcoRV site of pTRE2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to produce plasmid pTRE2-hclk2. The plasmid DNA was transfected into premade Tet-off HT-1080 cells (Clontech) using the superfect reagent (Qiagen). Cells were selected in 400 units/ml hygromycin 48 h after infection, and selection was continued until colonies were visible. 30 colonies were picked, and immunoblot analysis using anti-hCLK2 antibodies (see below) showed that five clones (numbers 3, 6, 11, 19, and 21) overexpressed hCLK2 in an inducible manner. Cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline (1 μg/ml) to turn off hCLK2 expression and grown in the absence of doxycycline to turn on hCLK2 expression. Immunoblot analysis showed that the level of expression of hCLK2 in the Tet-off cell line (clone 21) was dependent on the dosage of doxycycline. Knocking Down the Expression of hCLK2 by Sequence-specific Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Dharmacon Research (Lafayette, Colorado). siRNA duplex selection and transfection were performed as described (17Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8185) Google Scholar). The sequence of the siRNA for targeting endogenous hclk2 was as follows: sense siRNA, 5′-GCGGUAUCUCGGUGAGAUGdT-3′; antisense siRNA, 5′-CAUCUCACCGAGAUACCGCdT-3′. For each well of a six-well plate, 240 pmol of siRNA duplex was used. Cells were exposed to the siRNA treatment on day 1, and they were passaged 1:4 on day 4. Preparation of Antibodies Directed against hCLK-2 Protein—Two separate antigens were used to develop anti-hCLK2 polyclonal antibodies. The first antigen was generated as follows. A PCR fragment corresponding to bases 1516–1929 of the hclk2 clone hk02952, encoding amino acids 414–551 of hCLK2, was cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). A GST-hCLK2-(414–551) protein of the expected size (∼46 kDa) was expressed in DH10b bacteria and purified by affinity chromatography on a GST slurry. This recombinant protein was injected into two rabbits (2779 and 2780) to obtain polyclonal antibodies. To generate the second antigen, a PCR fragment corresponding to bases 279–1519 of the hclk2 clone hk02952, encoding amino acids 2–415 of hCLK2, was cloned into the pGEX-3X expression vector. A GST-hCLK2-(2–415) protein of the expected size (∼78 kDa) was expressed in DH10b bacteria and was purified from bacterial inclusion bodies. This recombinant protein was injected into two rabbits (2838 and 2839) to obtain polyclonal antibodies. All four sera specifically react to hCLK2 by the following criteria. The terminal bleed of each rabbit recognizes the corresponding bacterial antigen, in vitro translated hCLK2, a band at the expected size of ∼100 kDa in cell extracts, and a strong band of the same size in cells overexpressing hCLK2 (see Table I). This ∼100-kDa band is not detected by any of the preimmune sera. Moreover, this band disappears upon preabsorbtion of the antibody with the corresponding purified GST-hCLK2 protein but not upon preabsorbtion with other unrelated bacterially expressed proteins, including GST fusions. Also, the intensity of this band is drastically reduced in hclk-2-siRNA-treated cells as compared with controls. The serum from rabbit 2780 gave the strongest reaction and was used for immunoblot analyses throughout this study. Immunoblot Analysis—Cultured cells were trypsinized and pelleted and then resuspended in 5× volumes of extraction buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). The resuspended cells were submitted to five freeze-thaw cycles (frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed at 37 °C). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the quantity of protein was measured (Bio-Rad protein assay). 50 μg of protein were separated on 7.5 or 12% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were preincubated in blocking solution (TBS-T plus 5% nonfat milk) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight at the following concentrations: rabbit anti-hCLK2 antibody (1:500 to 1:1000), mouse anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:10000; Sigma), rabbit anti-actin antibody (1:500; Sigma), mouse anti-cytochrome c (1–2 μg/ml; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and mouse anti-p300 (2 μg/ml; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). After 3 × 15 min TBS-T washes, the membranes were incubated in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:3000; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) or goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20000; Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by three 15-min TBS-T washes. Finally, the signal was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Immunostaining—Cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid, and 24 h later, they were seeded on coverslips. Forty-eight hours later, the coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in acetone for 3 min, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-hCLK2 (2780, 2838, 1:100–1000), followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (1:5000) for 1 h. Finally, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (10 μg/ml) for 30 min and viewed under a Leitz fluorescence microscope. Similar results were obtained with 2780 and 2838 sera. The pattern observed was not detected by the preimmune sera or the secondary antibody alone. In addition, the observed pattern disappears upon preabsorbtion of the antibody with the corresponding purified GST-hCLK2 protein but not upon preabsorbtion with other unrelated bacterially expressed proteins, including GST fusions. Growth Rate Assay—Cells were seeded in six-well dishes at 1 × 105/well. At the times indicated, the cells were trypsinized and counted with a hemocytometer. Cell Death Assay—Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 in six-well dishes. The next day, the cells were treated by γ-ray (20 grays) and counted 72 h later. A series of different apoptosis-inducing agents was also investigated, and the cells were analyzed at various times following treatment (see Table II). Cell viability was measured by the trypan blue exclusion method, by counting with a hemocytometer.Table IICell death assaysTreatmentWorking concentrationTime of treatmenthEtoposide100 μM24Sodium azide15 μM48Menadione12 μM24Anisomycin2 μM16t-Butyl hydroperoxide40 μM48Staurosporine2 μM24All-trans-retinoic acid4 μM96Hydrogen peroxide0.5 μM24Juglone0.5 μM24Hydroxyurea0.6 mM96Tunicamycin5 μg/ml24 Open table in a new tab Measuring the Length of Telomeres—Genomic DNA from cultured cells was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. 10 μg of DNA was digested by HinfI and RsaI (10 units/μg DNA) at 37 °C overnight. The completely digested DNA was separated on 0.7% agarose gel at 23 V for 24 h and transferred by capillary transfer to a positively charged nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. The telomere-specific sequence (5′-TTAGGGTTAGGGTTAGGG-3′) was used as a probe to detect telomeric repeats. The membrane was incubated in prehybridization solution (5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS) for 1 h at 50 °C, followed by an overnight incubation in hybridization solution (5× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 5′-32P-end-labeled probe) at 37 °C. The membrane was then washed in 3× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 3 × 10 min and exposed at room temperature overnight. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions—Subcellular fractionation was performed as described (18Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar). From 1 to 10 × 107 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Sciences)) at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were homogenized on ice (10–20 strokes at 1000 rpm; Potter-Elvehjem) until 95% of the cells were lysed based on trypan blue dye uptake. The samples were transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf centrifuge tubes (1 ml/tube) and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to pellet the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was then resuspended in 0.5–2 ml of 1.6 m sucrose containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. After underlayering with 1–2 ml of 2.0–2.3 m sucrose containing the same buffer and centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 60 min, the resulting nuclear pellets were resuspended in 0.1–0.3 ml of 1% Triton X-100-containing buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100). The supernatant resulting from the initial low speed centrifugation was subjected to centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain the heavy membrane fraction (a pellet that should include mitochondria, lysosomes, Golgi, and rough endoplasmic reticulum). The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 15,000 × g to obtain the light membrane fraction (a pellet that should include the smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum) and the cytosolic fraction (supernatant). The heavy membrane and light membrane fractions were resuspended in 1% Triton-containing lysis buffer. An equal amount of protein (50 μg) from each fraction was analyzed by immunoblot. Growth Stimulation by Overexpression of hCLK2 in SK-HEP-1 Cells—To achieve high levels of hCLK2 expression in cultured cells, we used a retroviral vector expressing hCLK2 to infect a panel of cell lines (see “Experimental Procedures”) and established stable cell lines, derived from pools of cells infected with the vector expressing hCLK2 or the empty vector control. A high level of hCLK2 expression was detected in all of the established cell lines (Fig. 1A and data not shown). In every case, the cells expressing hCLK2 did not show any morphological alterations compared with controls (data not shown). We found, however, that the growth rate of SK-HEP-1 (19Heffelfinger S.C. Hawkins H.H. Barrish J. Taylor L. Darlington G.J. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) cells overexpressing hCLK2 was increased over the control line (Fig. 2A), indicating that growth rate is sensitive to the level of hCLK2. We then used SK-HEP-1 cells for all subsequent characterization of the function of hCLK2. Other cell lines did not display obvious effects on growth, and their phenotype was not studied further (see “Experimental Procedures”).Fig. 2The growth rate of SK-HEP-1 cells is affected by the level of expression of hCLK2.A, SK-HEP-1 cells overexpressing hCLK2 and control cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105/well in a six-well dish. At the indicated time (in days), cells were harvested, and the number of cells were counted using a hemocytometer. B, SK-HEP-1 cells were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105/well in a six-well dish and treated by siRNA or buffer the next day (day 1) at a density of about 1.5 × 105/well. Cell counts were done as above. For both panels, the means and S.E. of triplicate experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reducing the Level of hCLK2 Expression Causes Reversible Growth Arrest—To investigate the consequences of a loss of function of hclk2, we used the siRNA technique (17Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8185) Google Scholar). SK-HEP-1 cells were treated with either 1) hclk2-specific siRNA, 2) siRNA for luciferase, a gene that is not normally found in human cells, or 3) the same volume of siRNA annealing buffer. The level of hCLK2 and the cell number were determined daily for several days following siRNA treatment (Figs. 1B and 2B). The immunoblots demonstrate that when the cells were treated with hclk2-specific siRNA, the level of hCLK2 was significantly decreased by day 2 and remained low until at least day 6. As expected, neither luciferase siRNA nor siRNA annealing buffer alone resulted in a decrease of the expression of hCLK2. In addition, the expression of actin was not affected by hclk2- specific siRNA, luciferase siRNA, or siRNA annealing buffer alone (Fig. 1B). hclk2 siRNA treatment dramatically slowed cellular growth rate, in contrast to treatment with luciferase siRNA, which had only a minor effect (Fig. 2B). The effect on growth rate lasted until day 7, after which time the cells appeared to recover from the treatment and resumed growth. No increase in cell death or other obvious changes were observed, indicating that the arrest was not the consequence of major damage to the cells. Treated cells were also sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting according to DNA content (data not shown). The arrested cells treated with hclk2 siRNA did not appear to have arrested in any particular phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of hCLK2 Produces Hypersensitivity to Apoptosis Triggered by Oxidative Stress or DNA Replication Block—Prompted by the findings in the germ line of C. elegans, where clk-2 mutations affect the response to ionizing radiation and to DNA replication block induced by HU, we investigated the response of SK-HEP-1 cells overexpressing hCLK2 to 10 different agents capable of inducing apoptotic cell death as well as to HU and γ-rays. The cells overexpressing hCLK2 did not show any general increase in sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli but were specifically hypersensitive to two methods of increasing oxidative stress: menadione treatment, which leads to intracellular overproduction of superoxide (20Jamieson D.J. Rivers S.L. Stephen D.W. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 3277-3283Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and t-butyl hydroperoxide treatment, which leads to the production of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical (21Sano M. Kawabata H. Tomita I. Yoshioka H. Hu M.L. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1994; 43: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The cells were also hypersensitive to the DNA synthesis inhibitor HU (Fig. 3A). To verify that the cell death observed was indeed apoptotic, we stained the cells using the TUNEL method (22Desjardins L.M. MacManus J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 216: 380-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which consists of in situ labeling of the 3′-OH ends of the cleaved DNA typical of apoptotic cells. A significant increase in the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei was observed in cells treated with the compounds that produced increased cell death compared with controls, namely menadione, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and hydroxyurea (Fig. 3B). We have also investigated the response of siRNA-treated SK-HEP-1 cells and found that the cells depleted for hCLK2 did not show any general increase in sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli (data not shown). It is unclear whether a reduction in hCLK2 levels has no effect on the sensitivity of the cells to the agents used or whether the arrest produced by siRNA treatment prevents the detection of any effect. Overexpression of hCLK2 Gradually Lengthens Telomeres—To investigate whether hclk2 affects telomere length in human cells, as it does in S. cerevisiae and in C. elegans, we determined the telomere length of SK-HEP-1 cells overexpressing hCLK2 and of SK-HEP-1 control cells by Southern blot analysis. We examined the telomere length at regular intervals during prolonged culturing (138 population doublings) (Fig. 4). The telomere length of the cells overexpressing hCLK2 gradually grew longer at an average rate of ∼15 bp/population doubling, whereas it remained absolutely stable in the control cells (Fig. 4). Additional population doublings do not appear to increase telomere length further (data not shown). hCLK2 Is Present in Most Compartments of the Cell—To determine the subcellular localization of hCLK2, we used immunocytochemistry to detect native and overexpressed hCLK2 in SK-HEP-1 cells. The level of native hCLK2 appeared to be too low to be detectable by this method with our antisera directed against hCLK2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). However, in cells overexpressing hCLK2, the signal appeared to be everywhere in the cell, filling both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 5A). The same distribution was also observed in another overexpressing cell line HT-1080 (Fig. 5B). Controls included immunocytochemistry using the preimmune sera, the secondary antibody alone, and sera preabsorbed with a number of bacterial antigens. We determined the subcellular distribution of hCLK2 by immunocytochemistry following treatment with etoposide and menadione, two apoptotic triggering agents, which result in DNA replication inhibition and o"
https://openalex.org/W2060948866,"Previous work from our laboratory identified YggX as a protein whose accumulation increased the resistance of Salmonella enterica to superoxide stress, reversed defects attributed to oxidized [Fe-S] clusters, and decreased the spontaneous mutation frequency of the cells. Here we present work aimed at determining why the accumulation of YggX correlates with reduced mutation frequency. Genetic and biochemical data showed that accumulation of YggX reduced the damage to DNA by hydroxyl radicals. The ability of purified YggX to protect DNA from Fenton chemistry mediated damage in vitro and to decrease the concentration of Fe(II) ions in solution available for chelation provided a framework for the interpretation of data obtained from in vivo experiments. The interpretation of in vitro assay results, within the context of the in vivo phenotypes, was validated by a mutant variant of YggX (C7S) that was unable to function in vivo or in vitro. We propose a model, based on data presented here and reported earlier, that suggests YggX is a player in Fe(II) trafficking in bacteria.

Cell physiology is characterized by the integration of numerous metabolic and biochemical processes. This integration provides the efficiency and adaptability that are associated with microbial metabolisms. For instance, organisms that utilize molecular oxygen must minimize the potential consequences of toxic oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (CO2.¯) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which are generated during normal aerobic metabolism (1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Superoxide mediates the oxidation of labile [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing proteins (2Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), with the release of ferrous iron (Fe(II)) and H2O2. In addition to inactivating the enzyme, this process generates two substrates for the Fenton reaction (Fe(II) + H2O2 + H+ → Fe(III) + H2O + •OH), the biggest generator of hydroxyl radicals in the cell. Unlike the oxygen species H2O2 and CO2.¯, hydroxyl radicals have sufficient redox potential to oxidize both sugar and base residues in DNA (3Brawn K. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 206: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Lesko S.A. Lorentzen R.J. Ts'o P.O.

Chem. 1989; 264: 20509-20512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Left unchecked, this reactivity results in a high level of specific mutagenic lesions in the cell. Although bacterial cells have evolved several ways to eliminate toxic oxygen species (reviewed in Refs. 1Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar and 7Demple B. Hidalgo E. Ding H. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 119-128PubMed Google Scholar) or to repair damage when it occurs (8Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 9Lu A.L. Li X. Gu Y. Wright P.M. Chang D.Y. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 35: 141-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), there is a need to sequester the cellular Fe(II) that can participate in Fenton chemistry to prevent excessive damage to DNA and other macromolecules. The control of Fenton chemistry and the resulting damage is complicated by the multiple roles of iron in cellular metabolism. Although iron exists in two stable oxidation states, Fe(II) and Fe(III), nearly all non-biological iron is in the highly insoluble ferric (Fe(III)) form. Bacteria circumvent solubility problems by the use of extracellular Fe(III)-specific siderophores. Siderophore-Fe(III) complexes are transported into the cell where the iron is reduced to Fe(II) and released from the siderophore (reviewed in Ref. 10Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Additionally, Fe(II) in the environment can be directly transported (11Kammler M. Schon C. Hantke K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6212-6219Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The Fe(II) in the cell that is readily available for metabolic activity has been referred to by a variety of names, including transit, low molecular weight, or “free” iron pool (2Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 12Andrews S.C. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Processes such as regulation, cofactor biosynthesis, and iron storage draw from this pool. An unresolved question in iron trafficking in bacteria focuses on what the iron in this transit pool is liganded to (10Ratledge C. Dover L.G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2000; 54: 881-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ATP, GTP, pyrophosphate, polypeptides, and others may be liganded to the free iron and thus facilitate trafficking between siderophores and cellular processes requiring Fe(II) (12Andrews S.C. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of the status of the free iron pool have been limited by the techniques available, most of which rely to some extent on chelation. Results of these experiments necessarily reflect the affinities of the chelators employed, making it difficult to obtain general insights on the number and/or species of the ligands involved (13Petrat F. de Groot H. Sustmann R. Rauen U. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 489-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, the chelatable nature of this iron suggests that, unlike iron bound to storage proteins or in functional proteins, free iron can have a cytotoxic effect. Therefore, a major challenge the cell faces in maintaining iron homeostasis is to (i) sequester Fe(II) from participating in detrimental Fenton chemistry and (ii) make Fe(II) easily available for the cellular processes in which it is required. The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) 1The abbreviations used are: Fur, ferric uptake regulator protein; CFU, colony-forming unit(s); AP, abasic; 1,10-phen, 1,10-phenanthroline; NCE, no carbon E medium. 1The abbreviations used are: Fur, ferric uptake regulator protein; CFU, colony-forming unit(s); AP, abasic; 1,10-phen, 1,10-phenanthroline; NCE, no carbon E medium. protein is responsible for sensing Fe(II) levels inside the cell and regulating gene expression accordingly (reviewed in Refs. 14Hantke K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar and 15Braun V. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 779-786PubMed Google Scholar). It was recently suggested that a central function of Fur is sequestration of Fe(II). Various phenotypes associated with null mutations in fur have been attributed to a concomitant increase in cellular Fe(II) levels, one being increased mutagenesis (16Touati D. Jacques M. Tardat B. Bouchard L. Despied S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2305-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 17Nunoshiba T. Obata F. Boss A.C. Oikawa S. Mori T. Kawanishi S. Yamamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34832-34837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that, at least in part, the increased mutagenesis is due to the lack of Fur to sequester the free iron (18Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y.S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we reported that accumulation of the YggX protein resulted in (i) increased resistance to superoxide, (ii) decreased in spontaneous mutation frequency, and (iii) restoration of aconitase activity in various mutant backgrounds (i.e. gshA) (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The work presented herein was initiated to determine the mechanism of decreased mutagenesis caused by accumulation of the YggX protein. The results are consistent with a model in which the YggX protein has a role in sequestering cellular Fe(II), making it available for Fe-dependent cellular processes while keeping it removed from Fenton chemistry. We suggest that YggX is a component of the iron-trafficking machinery in Salmonella enterica and other bacteria.

Open table in a new tab The high frequency generalized transducing mutant of bacteriophage P22 (HT105/1, int-201) (23Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 119: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar) was used in all transductional crosses. The method for transduction and subsequent purification of transductants has been previously described (24Downs D.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1515-1521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isogenic strains were constructed with standard genetic techniques utilizing linked markers. Presence of the yggX* mutation was confirmed by Western analysis showing accumulation of YggX protein (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A standard curve was generated using purified YggX in concentrations from 0.4 to 8 ng of protein, visualized by Western analysis with anti-YggX antibody (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whole cells were harvested from LB overnight and mid-log phase cultures (A650 = 0.550). Aliquots (2–16 μl for overnight and 20–100 μl for mid log) were loaded directly into SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for visualization through Western analysis (26Boudsocq F. Campbell M. Devoret R. Bailone A. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Colony forming units (CFUs) were determined for both overnight and mid-log cultures by dilution plating, and 1 CFU was assumed to equal one cell. Molarity and amount of YggX per cell were determined using the standard curve generated from pure protein, with the number of cells loaded into the SDS-PAGE gel, and with the calculated volume of a single cell being 3.2 × 10–15 liter (27Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measurement of Polymerase-blocking DNA Lesions—Damaged template in a PCR reaction results in less product compared with undamaged template by blocking DNA polymerase (28Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). This correlation has been previously used to quantify DNA damage by PCR (29Van Houten B. Cheng S. Chen Y. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Woodmansee A.N. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34055-34066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was purified using an Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen). Template DNA concentrations were calculated using A260 spectroscopic readings and were as stated in Fig. 1. 100 pmol of each primer was used in all reactions. Primer sequences (5′ to 3′) and expected product sizes are as follows: CGTAATTCGGGATCCGCG and TCCACGTCAGCGGCGGTTTTAC, 4470-bp product (thiC-thiG); CATCGCAGGTAAAGTCGTCTCTAAA and TCCCGCGTAAACAATCAATAAAACA, 8301-bp product (rpoB-thiH). Amplification products were generated using the Z-Taq enzyme (TaKaRa Bio Inc.) according to specifications. Me2SO (2%) and glycerol (1%) were present and required for the reactions. Reactions were performed in a GeneAmp 2400 PCR system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the following conditions for PCR. For the 4.5-kb product: 94 °C for 2 min; 33 cycles of 94 °C for 10 s and 68 °C for 1 min 20 s; and final extension at 70 °C for 7 min. For the 8.3-kb product: 92 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 92 °C for 20 s and 68 °C for 2 min and 20 s; and final extension at 70 °C for 7 min. Amplification products were run on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, visualized using a Fotodyne gel documentation system, and quantified using Gel-Pro Analyzer software package (Media Cybernetics). The amount of PCR product was proportional to the amount of DNA template from DM5105 over the concentrations used in these experiments (data not shown). DNA Damage Quantification Kit, AP Site Counting—Genomic DNA was isolated as described above. Abasic (AP) lesions in the genomic DNA were quantified using a DNA damage quantification kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies) following the protocol provided. Data reported are the average and standard deviation of results with genomic DNA isolated from three independent cultures. Fusion Construction—Construction of lacZ mutations based on the observation of Cupples and Miller of codon invariance at position 461 (31Nghiem Y. Cabrera M. Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2709-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) into a cassette transducible in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium as described elsewhere (32Hudson R.E. Bergthorsson U. Roth J.R. Ochman H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Strains provided by H. Ochman contained MudF insertions at minute 40.2 in the S. enterica genome (tre-152::MudF), representing constructs CC103 (GC:CG reporter) and CC104 (GC:TA reporter). These constructs were transduced via P22 into strains DM5104 and DM5105, resulting in strains DM6222, DM6223, DM6911, and DM6912, respectively. Lac+Revertant Analysis—Aliquots (20 μl) of LB cultures, started from single colonies and incubated overnight at 37 °C, were used to inoculate 10-ml cultures of minimal glucose media. For each strain, ten independent cultures were grown overnight at 37 °C and plated in the following ways: For CC103 reporter strains, 10 ml (109 CFU) of culture was centrifuged and resuspended in 0.4 ml of 1× NCE and plated onto a single minimal medium plate with lactose as the sole carbon and energy source. Plates were incubated for 1–2 days at 37 °C, and colonies that arose were scored as one Lac+ CFU. Prior to centrifugation, a small volume (10 μl) from the 10-ml overnight culture was dilution-plated onto minimal glucose plates to determine total CFU/ml. The procedure for CC104 reporter strains was the same as above except that 250 μl (2.5 × 107 CFU) was plated from each independent overnight culture onto five minimal lactose plates. A/G-specific Adenine Glycosylase (MutY) Activity—A/G-specific adenine glycosylase (MutY) activity was assayed using conditions reported by Lu et al. (33Lu A.L. Tsai-Wu J.J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotide substrates (Chang-68 and Chang-69) described by Gu and Lu (34Gu Y. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were purchased and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. Protocols for substrate generation using 32P-labeled dCTP and assay procedure were followed as described previously (33Lu A.L. Tsai-Wu J.J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Gu Y. Lu A.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2666-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with the exception that reductant was not used in the assay buffer. Cell extracts were prepared from overnight LB cultures via sonication (two 10-s pulses consisting of 0.5-s bursts, with ∼1 min incubation on ice between pulses), clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for ∼5 min), transferred to new microcentrifuge tubes, and then frozen at –20 °C until used. Protein was quantified via Bradford assay (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli mutY null strain (CSH117) was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center (available at cgsc.biology.yale.edu). β-Galactosidase Activity—Overnight LB cultures of strains DM6762 and DM6763 were used as inoculum (1:100) into 5 ml of fresh LB containing various concentrations of FeCl3. Resulting cultures were grown with shaking at 37 °Cto ∼0.4 A650, pelleted, resuspended in 5 ml of minimal 1× NCE, and placed on ice until assayed. The assay was performed and quantified as described by Miller (36Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The yggX gene from S. enterica was amplified from a plasmid containing the wild-type gene (pYGGX3A) (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using primers that were designed to (i) eliminate the stop codon, (ii) introduce an NdeI restriction site that overlaps the start codon, and (iii) change the amino acid at position seven from cysteine to serine. The sequence of the PCR primers used (5′ to 3′) was as follows: YggX-NoTerm, TTTTTTATCTTCCGGCGT and YggX-C7S, CATATGAGCAGAACGATTTTTTCTACTT. The amplification product was then digested with NdeI, gel-purified, and ligated into the NdeI and SmaI sites of the pTYB2 vector (New England BioLabs). The resulting clone (pTYB2-YggX-C7S) was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing (data not shown). Vectors containing both mutant and wild-type gene sequences were electroporated into strain BL21(λDE3) of E. coli. Proteins were purified using chitin affinity chromatography with the IMPACT T7 Kit (New England BioLabs). Overexpression and purification were performed as described by the manufacturer using 30 mm dithiothreitol in the on-column cleavage step. The elution and cleavage process was performed twice, increasing the yield. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon Stirred Ultrafiltration Cell (Millipore) with a 3000 molecular weight cutoff filter then dialyzed into 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8) overnight with three buffer changes. The carboxyl terminus of proteins isolated in this manner contain a single glycine residue not present in the native protein. Assay conditions similar to those used by Zhao et al. (37Zhao G. Ceci P. Ilari A. Giangiacomo L. Laue T.M. Chiancone E. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27689-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) to demonstrate protection of DNA from oxidative damage by the Dps protein were used. The assay mixture contained Tris buffer (pH 7.8, 20 mm), ferrous sulfate (FeSO4, 50 μm), DNA (pVJS1, 1.8 μm), YggX protein (as indicated in Fig. 3), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 880 mm) in a final volume of 20 μl. FeSO4 was diluted from a 100 mm stock made fresh in double-distilled water (ddH2O) prior to every assay. Plasmid pVJS1 (10,850 bp) was purified with a Wizard Plus SV Miniprep kit (Promega). Buffer, DNA, FeSO4, and protein were mixed, with ddH2O added to make a final volume of 18 μl. After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, H2O2 (2 μlofan8.8 m solution) was added to initiate the reaction. Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, 3 μl of loading buffer was added, and 20 μl of the reaction mix was loaded into a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized with a Fotodyne gel documentation system. In a microtiter plate, Tris buffer (pH 7.8, 8.5 mm final concentration), protein (concentrations as indicated in Fig. 4), and FeSO4 (made fresh prior to each assay, 150 μm final concentration) were added to a final volume of 180 μl and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Chelatable Fe(II) was detected by adding 20 μl of 1,10-phenanthroline (6 mg/ml in 50% EtOH), incubating for an additional 10 min at room temperature, and measuring A510 using a SpectaMAX Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices). The Bradford method of quantifying protein can be inaccurate when detecting amounts of a single protein species (38Althaus E.W. Outten C.E. Olson K.E. Cao H. O'Halloran T.V. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6559-6569Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); therefore, no inferences regarding stoichiometry have been made. Accumulation of YggX Protein Is Strain-specific—Previous work described an isogenic pair of strains, DM5104 and DM5105, differing only in the level of YggX protein that accumulated (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). YggX was not detectable in strain DM5104 by immunoblot analysis with polyclonal antibodies, even though the complete wild-type yggX coding sequence was present in the chromosome. Control experiments showed that the antibodies used could detect as little as 50 pg of pure YggX protein. Quantitative immunoblot analysis performed with mid-log cultures showed that strain DM5105 accumulated 0.16 mm YggX (∼8,000 copies of the protein/cell); in stationary phase cells, ∼12,000 copies of YggX/cell were present (data not shown). It is worth noting that E. coli K12 and all the wild-type isolates of the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium LT series (#1–22) obtained from the Salmonella Genetic Stock Center accumulated YggX protein to levels qualitatively similar to that of strain DM5105 (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). 2J. A. Gralnick, D. M. Wolfe, and D. M. Downs, unpublished. Strain DM5104, rather than a strain lacking the yggX gene, was used for the work reported here, because (i) it contains the yggX allele from the LT2 isolate that is the progenitor of the majority of our laboratory strains and (ii) its use avoided possible detrimental consequences caused by a complete lack of the protein. 3J. A. Gralnick and D. M. Downs, unpublished observations. In other words, the work described here utilizes two genetic backgrounds that differ only in the level of YggX accumulation. The physiological differences between these strains can thus be attributed to the level of YggX and used to probe the function of this protein in vivo. Strains Expressing YggX Protein Accumulate Less DNA Damage—Previous genetic analyses showed that strains accumulating the YggX protein had a lower frequency of spontaneous mutations (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To probe the basis for this difference, physical damage of the chromosomal DNA was determined. The method of Van Houten et al. (29Van Houten B. Cheng S. Chen Y. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used to determine the relative number of polymerase-blocking lesions in the DNA of strains DM5104 and DM5105. Chromosomal DNA from each strain was used as reaction template for quantitative PCR reactions (28Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 29Van Houten B. Cheng S. Chen Y. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is known that the concentration of polymerase-blocking lesions in the reaction template is inversely proportional to the quantity of amplified product (29Van Houten B. Cheng S. Chen Y. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Two products from the 90-min region of the chromosome were amplified. One product was 4.5 kb (primers flanking thiC and thiG); the second one was 8.3 kb (primers in rpoB and thiH). Fig. 1 displays the results of this experiment when the 4.5-kb fragment was amplified. When equal amounts of template DNA were used, the quantity of amplified product from DM5104 DNA was significantly less than when DNA from strain DM5105 was used. Similar results were found when the larger PCR product was monitored (data not shown). These results were consistent with the presence of more polymerase-blocking lesions in the strain that failed to accumulate YggX. Chromosomal damage was independently measured to determine the concentration of abasic (AP) sites in the DNA (DNA Damage Quantification kit, Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.). AP sites are common lesions in DNA and are thought to be intermediates in mutagenesis. Genomic DNA from strains DM5104 or DM5105 was treated with aldehyde reactive probe reagent (a compound that reacts specifically with an aldehyde group in the open ring form of an AP site), resulting in biotin-tagged AP sites that are quantified using an avidin-biotin assay (39Nakamura J. Walker V.E. Upton P.B. Chiang S.Y. Kow Y.W. Swenberg J.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 222-225PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, DNA from strain DM5104 consistently contained a higher concentration of AP lesions than that from DM5105. In a representative experiment, DM5105 DNA contained 3.7 ± 0.6 AP sites per 105 bp compared with 10.2 ± 2.6 sites per 105 bp found in DNA isolated from the isogenic strain (DM5104) that contained no detectable YggX. The results of these two independent approaches demonstrated that fewer lesions in the DNA were present when a strain accumulated YggX and provided an explanation for the genetic results previously reported (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accumulation of YggX Specifically Decreased the Frequency of GC to TA Transversion Mutations—The specificity of the spontaneous mutations absent when YggX accumulated was addressed using lacZ reporter constructs. Specific lacZ reporters, originally constructed in E. coli by Cupples and Miller (40Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar) and reconstructed into a transposable element in S. enterica by Hudson et al. (32Hudson R.E. Bergthorsson U. Roth J.R. Ochman H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), were obtained. In otherwise Lac– strains carrying these reporters, the appearance of Lac+ colony-forming units reflects a specific codon change (40Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The choice of specific reporters was prompted by the effect of YggX on superoxide stress (19Gralnick J. Downs D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8030-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the proximity of yggX to the DNA glycosylase encoded by mutY (41Gifford C.M. Wallace S.S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4223-4236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the induction of yggX expression by superoxide stress (42Pomposiello P.J. Demple B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Two constructs were used for t"
https://openalex.org/W2133788402,"We have determined the solution NMR structure of a recombinant peptide that consists of the first 156 residues of erythroid α-spectrin. The first 20 residues preceding the first helix (helix C′) are in a disordered conformation. The subsequent three helices (helices A1, B1, and C1) form a triple helical bundle structural domain that is similar, but not identical, to previously published structures for spectrin from Drosophila and chicken brain. Paramagnetic spin label-induced NMR resonance broadening shows that helix C′, the partial domain involved in α- and β-spectrin association, exhibits little interaction with the structural domain. Surprisingly, helix C′ is connected to helix A1 of the structural domain by a segment of 7 residues (the junction region) that exhibits a flexible disordered conformation, in contrast to the predicted rigid helical structure. We suggest that the flexibility of this particular junction region may play an important role in modulating the association affinity of α- and β-spectrin at the tetramerization site of different isoforms, such as erythroid spectrin and brain spectrin. These findings may provide insight for explaining various physiological and pathological conditions that are a consequence of varying α- and β-subunit self-association affinities in their formation of the various spectrin tetramers.

Spectrin, a member of the spectrin superfamily and a major protein in the membrane (cyto)skeleton, is ubiquitous among vertebrate tissues, as well as in simple metazoans, implying that spectrin plays a fundamental role in cells (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 2Gascard P. Mohandas N. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2000; 7: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3Goodman S.R. Brain Res. Bull. 1999; 50: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After first being identified in erythrocytes (4Yu J. Fischman D. Steck T.L. J. Supramol. Struct. 1973; 1: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), many distinct spectrin isoforms have since been discovered. In humans, two α-spectrin subunits (αI and αII), four β-spectrin subunits (βI, βII, βIII, and βIV), and a β-H subunit have been sequenced (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Similar isoforms in mice have also been studied (5Goodman S.R. Zimmer W.E. Clark M.B. Zagon I.S. Barker J.E. Bloom M. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 36: 593-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing (e.g. see Ref. 6Hayes N.V. Scott C. Heerkens E. Ohanain V. Maggs A.M. Pinder J.C. Kordeli E. Baines A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2023-2024PubMed Google Scholar) adds additional diversity among α- and β-spectrin isoforms. Many functions of different spectrin isoforms involve interactions with other molecules such as spectrin-actin interaction, spectrin-membrane interaction, spectrin-ion channel interaction, etc. (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Yet some of the most fundamental functions of spectrin involve spectrin “self-association.” The activity of spectrin in stabilizing cell-cell contacts and in achieving normal columnar epithelial cell shape requires the formation of tetramers (1Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 7McKeown C. Prates V. Austin J. Development. 1998; 125: 2087-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kamiguchi H. Lemmon V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 598-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Spectrin tetramers have been suggested to be cooperatively coupled to membrane assembly (9Giorgi M. Cianci C. Gallagher P. Morrow J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Many hereditary hemolytic anemias involve single amino acid mutations in erythrocyte spectrin that destabilize its tetramers, resulting in low levels of spectrin tetramers and high levels of dimers (9Giorgi M. Cianci C. Gallagher P. Morrow J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Delaunay J. Dhermy D. Semin.

Haematol. 1995; 89: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, the tetramerization site is an important functional site for most spectrins. In erythrocyte spectrin (αI/βI), α- and β-spectrin associate with relatively high affinity (nmKd values) at the N-terminal end of the β-spectrin and the C-terminal end of the α-spectrin (dimer nucleation site) to give αβ heterodimers (12Speicher D.W. Weglarz L. DeSilva T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14775-14782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Begg G.E. Harper S.L. Morris M.B. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3279-3287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Two dimers then associate with low affinity (μmKd values) to form spectrin tetramers. Two sets of identical interactions between the N-terminal region of α-spectrin (αN) of one αβ dimer and the C-terminal region of β-spectrin (βC) in another dimer give an (αβ)2 tetramer (14DeSilva T.M. Peng K.C. Speicher K.D. Speicher D.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10872-10878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J.

Based on secondary structural prediction from sequence, it has been suggested that both α- and β-subunits of erythrocyte spectrin mostly consist of triple helical bundles (coiled coils) and that these triple helical bundle structural domains are linked sequentially (16Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1982; 18: 479-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 17Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Nature. 1984; 311: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Because α- and β-spectrin form very large, flexible oligomeric complexes, detailed experimental information on the structure of intact spectrin has been difficult to obtain. Structural studies of recombinant peptides of spectrin fragments, by both x-ray and NMR methods, support the general model of the triple helical bundle (helices A–C) for each structural domain (18Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol.

However, no experimental information is available for the partial domains involved in the tetramerization process. Unfortunately, peptides with just the partial domain alone do not seem to be suitable for structural studies due to their tendency to aggregate in solution at low concentrations. However, a recombinant peptide, consisting of the first 156 residues of αIΣ1spectrin (Spα1–156) 1The abbreviations used are: Spα1–156, a peptide consisting of the first 156 residues of αIΣ1spectrin; MTSSL, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl pyrroline-3-methylmethane thiosulfonate; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; SW, sweep width. and thus of the proposed partial domain and the first full structural domain, is a suitable model for studying the α-tetramerization site by solution NMR methods. NMR Samples—Spα1–156 peptide was prepared as before (21Park S. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Lusitani D.M. Qtaishat N.

NMR. 1999; 15: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). NMR samples were prepared in 5 mm phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.01% NaN3 as well as 95% H2O and 5% D2O. NMR Experiments—Backbone resonance assignments using triple resonance spectra were reported previously (24Park S. Liao X. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Additional two-dimensional NOESY, 1H,15N-NOESY-HSQC, 1H,13C-NOESY-HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, and four-dimensional 1H,13C-HMQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired with either a Bruker DRX/DMX 600 (14.1 Tesla) or a DMX 750 (17.62 Tesla) spectrometer equipped with triple axis gradient triple resonance probes at 20 °C. Four-dimensional HMQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra were acquired using the aliasing scheme described previously (25Morshauser R.C. Zuiderweg E.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 139: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The directly detected proton domain was acquired with 512 complex points, tmax of 56.9 ms and sweep width (SW) of 8992.9 Hz; the t3 domain with 16 complex points, tmax of 3.7 ms and SW of 2136 Hz; the t2 domain with 36 complex points, tmax of 2.98 ms and SW of 6024 Hz, and the t1 domain with 72 complex points, tmax of 5.96 ms and SW of 6024 Hz. Side chain resonances were assigned using 1H,15N-NOESY-HSQC, 1H,15N-TOCSY-HSQC, HCCH-TOCSY, and four-dimensional 1H,13C-HMQC-NOESY-HSQC spectra. All raw data were processed and analyzed using Felix 97.0 software (MSI/Accelerys, San Diego, CA). Structure Calculation—A published protocol for structure calculation (26Guilhaudis L. Jacobs A. Caffrey M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4860-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) was followed. Briefly, the three-dimensional structure was calculated based on NOE-derived distance and angle constraints. The distance restraints were derived from NOE intensities on the two-dimensional NOESY (for an unlabeled sample in deuterium oxide), 15N-edited and 13C-edited three-dimensional (NOESY-HSQC), and 13C-edited four-dimensional (HMQC-NOESY-HSQC) spectra. NOEs were classified as strong (<2.7 or 2.9 Å for amide protons), medium (3.3 or 3.5 Å for amide protons), weak (<5.0 Å), and very weak (<6.0 Å). A correction of 0.5 Å was added to proton distances involving methyl groups. Standard pseudo-atom corrections were applied as needed. The lower distance bounds were set to 1.8 Å in all intensity categories. The backbone Φ and Ψ angle constraints were obtained from 3-bond coupling constants (3JHNHα) and the chemical shift values using the program TALOS (27Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). For regular helical residues where those angle constraints are unavailable, Φ angles were constrained to –60 ± 20 and Ψ to –40 ± 20 (19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond constraints derived from amide proton-deuterium exchange experiments were used to constrain the NH-O distance to 1.5–2.8 Å and the N-O distance to 2.4–3.5 Å. The CNS program was used for the actual calculation (28Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), implementing the conformational data bases and the secondary chemical shifts data base described earlier (29Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 125: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

The side chain rotamers were determined by a combination of NOE and dihedral and data base terms. The data base term biases the dihedral angles to physiologically relevant angles (e.g. Ψ1 = –60, 180, or +60) in the absence of NOE or dihedral terms. The calculation started from an extended conformation subjected to simulated annealing in torsion angle space followed by Cartesian space annealing (32Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brunger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. 1997; 124: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). 150 simulated annealing runs with differing initial trajectories were performed. The resulting structures were subjected to conjugate gradient energy minimization. The 10 lowest energy conformers were used as final structures; the mean structure was generated by coordinate averaging of all structures, followed by restrained energy minimization. The stereochemical geometries of the structures in the ensemble were compared and analyzed by PROCHECK (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4471) Google Scholar). The electrostatic map and structural figures were generated by the molecular graphics program MOLMOL (34Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14 (51–55): 29-32Crossref Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Paramagnetic Spin Labeling—For paramagnetic spin labeling at residue 154, leucine was replaced with cysteine, using a mutagenesis protocol (QuickChange from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to give Spα1–156L154C. The primers had the following sequences: 5′-AGAAGGGTGACCAGTGCCTGCGGTAGGAATTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAATTCCTACCGCAGGCACTGGTCACCCTTCT-3′ (antisense). Protein purification steps used for Spα1–156 were followed except for the final step, where dithiothreitol was added (2 mg/ml final concentration) to the sample to reduce any potential intermolecular disulfide bonds. The unreacted dithiothreitol was removed with a Sephadex G-25 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences). The spin label, 1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl pyrroline-3-methylmethane thiosulfonate (MTSSL), was then added to the sample at a molar ratio of 5:1, incubated for3hinthe dark, followed by gel filtration to remove excess MTSSL. The number of spin labels bound to Spα1–156L154C was checked by EPR method (35Cherry L. Menhart N. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2077-2084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Model Building of Tetramerization Region—The three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal end of β-spectrin (βIΣ1) is not yet available. A β-recombinant peptide consisting of C-terminal region residues 1898–2083 associates with Spα1–156 with an affinity similar to that of αβ spectrin (36Mehboob S. Luo B.H. Patel B.M. Fung L.W.-M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12457-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sequence homology analysis suggested that the C-terminal region consists of a partial domain of two helices (15Speicher D.W. DeSilva T.M. Speicher K.D. Ursitti J.A. Hembach P. Weglarz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4227-4235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Tse W.T. Lecomte M.C. Costa F.F. Garbarz M. Feo C. Boivin P. Dhermy D. Forget B.G. J. Clin.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11400-11408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the region after residue 2072 (Thr) at the C-terminal end of β-spectrin is not critical for the association with α-spectrin (39Luo B.H. Mehboob S. Hurtuk M.G. Pipalia N.H. Fung L.W.-M. Eur. J. Haematol. 2002; 68: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We suggest that residues 2008–2037 form a helix similar to helix A in the structural domain of α-spectrin and residues 2044–2072 form another helix similar to helix B of α-spectrin (36Mehboob S. Luo B.H. Patel B.M. Fung L.W.-M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12457-12464Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These two helices in β-spectrin are referred to as helix A′ and helix B′. The single helix partial domain of α-spectrin, with its structure determined in this study, is referred to as helix C′. The subsequent helices in the structural domain part of Spα1–156 are referred to as helices A1,B1, and C1. A sequence alignment program LALIGN (www.ch.embnet.org.software/LALIGN_form.html) was used to compare sequence homology between helix A′/helix B′ of β-spectrin and helix A1/helix B1 of α-spectrin, and between helix C′ and helix C1, both of α-spectrin. We found that the corresponding helices exhibited homology with a 25–30% similarity (40Park S. Mehboob S. Luo B.-H. Hurtuk M.G. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 571-585PubMed Google Scholar), sufficient for the two β-helices (helices A′ and B′) to be modeled, respectively, from the NMR coordinates of helices A1 and B1 of α-spectrin determined in this study. Together with the coordinates of helix C′, also determined in this study, a structural model for the association of α- and β-partial domains was obtained using the program SWISS-MODEL (41Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar). Because helix C′ consists of 25 residues (see “Results” below) and helix C1 consists of 31 residues, the register of helix C′ with helices A′ and B′ in this model is not certain, and thus was guided by matching the heptad patterns in the helices. The backbone atoms of helix C′ were mapped to those of helix C1, with residue Ala-21 in helix C′ matched with residue His-126 in helix C1. Thus, the first residue in helix C′ was in register with the first residue in helix A1 in our model. The actual register of helices A′, B′, and C′ awaits experimental verification. Resonance Assignment—Resonance assignments and secondary structures were described previously (21Park S. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Park S. Liao X. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 15: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Backbone resonances were all assigned with double and triple resonance spectra except for residues 36, 83, and 125. The side chain proton and carbon assignments were quite challenging, due to the relatively low experimental temperature (20 °C), the extensive overlap of α-proton and α-carbon chemical shifts from the mostly helical nature of the protein, and the presence of a very long and highly flexible region (residues 1–20) that gave intense truncation artifacts in the processed spectrum. Nevertheless, the proton and carbon resonances of most of the methyl-containing residues were assigned, which were essential for getting long range distance constraints. Aromatic protons were assigned based on NOESY and TOCSY experiments using samples dissolved in deuterium oxide. An example of NOE peak assignment on the four-dimensional NOESY spectrum for the methyl group of leucine 65 is shown in Fig. 1. Thirty eight residues scattered throughout the entire peptide have no assignments for the side chain carbons. Structural Refinement and Structural Statistics—A total of 1473 structural constraints (1206 distance and 267 dihedral angle constraints) (Table I) were used to determine the structure of Spα1–156. The number of distance constraints is similar to that of earlier studies of chicken brain spectrin peptide (1035 distance constraints) (19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and is relatively small compared with globular proteins of a similar number of amino acid residues, due to the nature of helical bundling with fewer than usual inter-segmental contacts, as noted previously (19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The number of distance constraints as a function of residue number is shown in Fig. 2A.Table ISummary of structural refinement for Spα1-156 and structural statistics for the 10 simulated annealing structures and the minimized mean structureNo. NOE distance constraints (r.m.s.d.)Short range (|i — j| ≤ 1)500 (0.024 ± 0.001 Å)Medium range (2 ≤|i — j| ≤ 5)525 (0.045 ± 0.002 Å)Long range (5 <|i — j|)77 (0.018 ± 0.004 Å)Hydrogen bond104 (0.004 ± 0.002 Å)No. dihedral angle (ϕ, ψ) constraints (r.m.s.d.)267 (0.58 ± 0.053°)No. ϕ angle constraints from 3JHNHα (r.m.s.d.)96 (0.978 ± 0.038 Hz)Total structural constraints1473Deviations from idealized covalent geometry bonds0.003 ± 0.000 ÅDeviations from idealized covalent geometry angles0.469 ± 0.009°Deviations from idealized improper torsion angles0.476 ± 0.013°No. NOE violations >0.5 Å0No. dihedral angle >6°0Residues in allowed regions (as defined by PROCHECK program)99.6%Residues in the most favorable regions 95.4%Residues in additionally allowed regions 3.2%Residues in generously allowed regions 1.0%Residues in disallowed regions0.4%R.m.s.d. from the mean structureResidues 52-156Backbone atoms1.3 ± 0.2 ÅAll heavy atoms1.9 ± 0.2 ÅResidues in α-helical conformationBackbone atoms1.0 ± 0.2 ÅHeavy atoms1.6 ± 0.2 Å Open table in a new tab About 150 initial structures were obtained. The 10 lowest energy structures were taken as our structural ensemble (Fig. 3). The bond angle and improper torsion angle analyses show that the structures have close to ideal geometries when compared with known values. There were no dihedral angle violations larger than 5o, except for one violation of 5.008o. In addition, none of the 10 structures showed NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å. The structural domain region (residues 52–156), when calculated alone, converges much better than the full-length protein (residues 1–156). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) values of each structure against the coordinate-averaged mean structure as a function of residue number for the structural domain is shown in Fig. 2B. For the regions with α-helical conformation, the r.m.s.d. value was 1.0 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.6 Å for all heavy atoms (Table I). The quality of the calculated structures in terms of the backbone Φ and Ψ angle distribution is represented by the Ramachandran plot for all of the ensemble structures (Fig. 4). The analysis shows that 99.6% of all of the residues in the 10 structures (1560 residues) are in the overall allowed regions (as defined by the PROCHECK program (33Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4471) Google Scholar)) (Table I). The remaining residues (0.4% or 6 residues) in the disallowed regions were residues in loop or random coil regions, and none of the residues in the regular helical regions appeared in the disallowed region (Table I).Fig. 4Ramachandran plot of the calculated structures, generated with the PROCHECK-NMR program (33Laskowski R.A.

This helix is connected to a triple helical bundle by a random coil segment of 7 residues. We refer to the first helix as helix C′, the 7 residue random coil segment as a junction region, and the three bundled helices in the structural domain as helices A1, B1, and C1. Helical Length in the Structural Domain—Helices A1, B1, and C1 in the first structural domain of α-spectrin are slightly bent around each other, similar to helices in other coiled-coil systems and in non-erythroid spectrins (18Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol.

Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In comparison with those in chicken brain α-spectrin and in Drosophila α-spectrin (see Ref. 21Park S. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar and see Table I in Ref. 40Park S. Mehboob S. Luo B.-H. Hurtuk M.G. Johnson M.E. Fung L.W.-M. Cell. & Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 571-585PubMed Google Scholar), these spectrin helices are generally similar in structure. However, small structural differences that may be critical to functional differences are noted in the curvature and the length of these helices, as well as in the random coil segments linking the helices. The differences in helical lengths may be due to specific locations of different structural domains in spectrin. It has been suggested that structural domains may consist of helices with somewhat differing helical lengths, depending on the location of specific domains along the whole length of spectrin (42Speicher D.W. Davis G. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14938-14947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our structural domain is the 1st structural domain in α-spectrin; the one in the Drosophila x-ray structure is the 14th structural domain (18Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and that in the chicken brain NMR and x-ray structures is the 16th structural domain (19Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Walther D. Saraste M. Nilges M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 740-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 20Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is also quite possible that the differences in helical length are due to different spectrin isoforms and that the fine structural features in human erythrocyte spectrin differ from those in chicken brain and Drosophila spectrin. In chicken brain spectrin, there is a large difference in lengths between helices A and B (14 residue difference), leading to the formation of an apparent double helical bundle at the beginning of the structural domain, instead of a triple helical bundle (20Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Drosophila spectrin does not appear to have an appreciable portion of double helical region. Spα1–156 forms a triple helical bundle with the helical ends mostly matched since helices A1, B1, and C1 have about the same number of residues. Because chicken brain α-spectrin helices are of different lengths, it has been suggested that conformational rearrangement of the helices may provide flexibility in erythroid spectrin (20Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragon A. Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our findings for erythroid spectrin do not support this speculation. Inter-helical Interactions—Four groups of significant side chain interactions have been identified in bundling helices A–C in Drosophila α-spectrin (18Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Interaction in the group 1 region involves hydrophobic interactions between the side chains of the 7th residue in helix A (A7), the 29th residue in helix B (B29), and the 4th residue in helix C (C4) (Table II). Group 2 region interactions involve Trp/His/Trp (A17/B18/C15) side chains, and group 3 region"

It has been shown that inactive IκBα·NF-κB complexes shuttle in and out of the nucleus, whereas IκBβ·NF-κB complexes are retained exclusively in the cytoplasm of resting cells. The biochemical mechanism underlying this functional difference and its consequences are unknown. Although the two IκB proteins are significantly homologous, IκBβ contains a unique 47-amino acid insertion of unknown function within its ankyrin repeat domain. In this study, we assess the role of the IκBβ insert in regulating cytoplasmic retention of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. Deletion of the IκBβ insert renders IκBβ·NF-κB complexes capable of shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm, similar to IκBα·NF-κB complexes. A small Ras-like G-protein, κB-Ras, participates with the IκBβ insert to effectively mask the NF-κB nuclear localization potential. Similarly, a complex between NF-κB and a mutant IκBβ protein containing four serine to alanine mutations within its C-terminal proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich sequence exhibits nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. This suggests a phosphorylation state-dependent role for the C-terminal proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich sequence of IκBβ in proper localization of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. These results are consistent with structural studies, which predicted that binary IκBβ·NF-κB complexes should be capable of nuclear translocation, and with previous observations that hypophosphorylated IκBβ·NF-κB complexes can reside in the nucleus.

The five mammalian NF-κB subunits, p50, p52, p65 (RelA), c-Rel, and RelB, share a homologous N-terminal sequence of ∼300 amino acids in length known as the Rel homology region. The Rel homology region is responsible for subunit dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding. C-terminal transcription activation domains are present only in p65, c-Rel, and RelB. Although present in most cell types, NF-κB dimers with transactivation potential are maintained inactive through their stable association with the inhibitor proteins IκBα and IκBβ (4Verma I.M.

The mechanism underlying this persistently active NF-κB remains unclear. In an effort to understand the source of differential NF-κB activation kinetics, several groups have begun investigating the molecular mechanisms of action of the IκBα and IκBβ inhibitor proteins. One clear difference has emerged involving the manner by which these two proteins regulate NF-κB subcellular localization (26Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies have revealed that IκBα·NF-κB complexes shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus in quiescent cells (27Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J.

In contrast, inactive IκBβ·NF-κB complexes remain exclusively in the cell cytoplasm (30Huang T.T. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell.

A mechanistic explanation for the dynamic shuttling behavior of IκBα·NF-κB complexes has been described recently. X-ray structures of the IκBα·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex revealed that IκBα masks the nuclear localization signal (NLS) 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; PEST, proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich sequence; LMB, leptomycin B; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: NLS, nuclear localization signal; PEST, proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine-rich sequence; LMB, leptomycin B; HA, hemagglutinin. of the NF-κB p65 subunit but fails to mask the p50 subunit NLS (33Huxford T.

Cell. 1998; 95: 749-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Protease protection assays revealed that one NLS in the IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer and IκBα·NF-κB c-Rel homodimer complexes is also exposed to solvent and sensitive to protease cleavage (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 2C. Phelps, unpublished data. 2C. Phelps, unpublished data. Nuclear import of the IκBα·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex is imparted by the free p50 NLS, whereas the one free p65 subunit NLS is sufficient to convey similar shuttling properties upon the IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Active export of the complex from the nucleus relies on nuclear export signals located in the N-terminal signal response region of IκBα and the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit (27Johnson C. Van Antwerp D. Hope T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6682-6693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Huang T.T. Kudo N. Yoshida M. Miyamoto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In an accompanying study, we describe the x-ray crystal structure of an IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex (see Ref. 43Malek S. Huang D.-B. Huxford T. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23094-23100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The structure reveals that, like IκBα·NF-κB complexes, the NLS of one NF-κB p65 subunit (subunit A) is effectively masked by IκBβ, whereas the second p65 subunit (subunit B) NLS is largely solvent-exposed. This observation is somewhat unexpected because the second NF-κB subunit NLS is significantly less sensitive to cleavage by proteases when bound to IκBβ (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains unclear as to how IκBβ·NF-κB complexes are retained within the cytoplasm of resting cells. Recently, a small Ras-like protein was identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen as an IκBβ C-terminal PEST sequence-interacting factor and inhibitor of NF-κB activation (36Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). It was suggested that this protein, named κB-Ras, might function by inhibiting IκBβ degradation. In the present study, we show that κB-Ras is a critical regulator of IκBβ·NF-κB complex subcellular distribution. κB-Ras binds through a unique 47-amino acid insert between ankyrin repeats 3 and 4 of IκBβ and partially masks one p65 subunit NLS in vitro and completely masks it in vivo. The conversion of serines in the IκBβ PEST sequence to non-phosphorylatable residues further alters the subcellular localization properties of IκB·NF-κB complexes. These data suggest that additional factors may bind κB-Ras and IκBβ·NF-κB complexes and sequester them to the cytoplasm of quiescent cells. We propose that regulated association and dissociation of κB-Ras determine the subcellular localization of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. Mammalian Cell Transfection—HeLa cell transfection was performed by the LipofectAMINE method (Invitrogen). Leptomycin B (LMB) (5 ng/ml) was added 3 h before harvesting cells. LMB is a generous gift from Prof. M. Yoshida (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan). Immunofluorescence—Cells (with or without LMB treatment) were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.01% sodium azide (ISB). Blocking was done using 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin followed by incubation for 30 min with primary antibodies in ISB. Cells were then washed three times with ISB. Fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody was added in ISB at room temperature. Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. Cytoplasmic extracts were made by lysing cells in 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (lysis buffer). Fifty μg of extract was mixed with protein A-agarose and primary antibodies and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE buffer by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was separated by10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins in the gel were transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween and incubated with anti-p65 polyclonal antibody (H-286; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ig (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized by use of the ECL reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). For in vitro immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.5 μg of NF-κB was mixed with 4 μg of IκB in the presence or absence of 4 μg of κB-Ras in a 15 μl binding reaction. The mixture was incubated on ice for 2 h followed by dilution to 100 μl in lysis buffer. Four μl of this diluted complex was used for the immunoprecipitation reaction using 0.1 μg of the anti-p65 NLS monoclonal antibody (a generous gift from Roche Diagnostics). The immunoprecipitates were then loaded on a Western blot, as described above. The Unique IκBβ Insert Inhibits Nuclear Import of IκBβ·NF-κB Complexes—The finding that one p65 subunit (subunit B) NLS is at most weakly bound by IκBβ suggests that this NLS may also be capable of translocating the IκBβ·NF-κB complex to the nucleus. It has been shown previously that IκBβ·NF-κB complexes are cytoplasmic in quiescent cells (30Huang T.T. Miyamoto S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4737-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 31Tam W.F. Sen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7701-7704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Therefore, it follows that in quiescent cells the p65 subunit B NLS polypeptide must bind to IκBβ more stably than the binding mode revealed in IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex crystal structure (see Ref. 43Malek S. Huang D.-B. Huxford T. Ghosh S. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23094-23100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test whether the unique 47-amino acid insertion within the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBβ plays any role in determining the subcellular localization of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes, we deleted this insert from IκBβ (residues 152–192) and observed the co-localization of this mutant (IκBβΔ-(152–192)) with NF-κB p65 homodimer in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). We observe that both complexes are cytoplasmic in resting cells. However, in the presence of LMB, an inhibitor of nuclear export receptor CRM1, the mutant IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex, but not the wild type complex, is predominantly nuclear (37Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar, 38Kudo N. Khochbin S. Nishi K. Kitano K. Yanagida M. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29742-29751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that, like the wild type IκBβ, mutant IκBβΔ-(152–192) is also associated with p65 (Fig. 1C). Our results thus demonstrate that the insert of IκBβ plays a role in vivo in IκBβ·NF-κB complex cytoplasmic retention. We have also tested whether the insert of IκBβ is responsible for cytosolic retention of the IκBβ·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex (Fig. 1B). As in the case of the IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex, we observe that the IκBβΔ-(152–192) protein in complex with NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer can also enter the nucleus of resting cells. A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that when the insert of IκBβ is removed, the second NLS becomes free (or more loosely bound to IκBβ), enabling the complex to be actively imported into the nucleus. These results suggest that the p50 subunit in the p50/p65 heterodimer acts similarly to p65 subunit B in the NF-κB p65 homodimer, which possesses an NLS polypeptide that is primarily solvent-exposed. The p50 Subunit NLS Regulates Nuclear Translocation of IκBβ·NF-κB p50/p65 Heterodimer Complexes—To further test whether nuclear translocation of the IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex is mediated by the free p50 NLS, we performed co-transfection experiments with a p50 subunit that lacks its NLS polypeptide (p50ΔNLS), p65, and IκBβΔ-(152–192) (Fig. 2). We observe that this complex is cytoplasmic in both the absence and presence of LMB, suggesting that only in the IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex is the p50 NLS free, whereas it remains masked in the wild type IκBβ·NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer complex. These results indicate that one NF-κB NLS and the IκBβ insert antagonize one another in directing subcellular localization of all IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. κB-Ras Regulates the p65 Subunit B NLS of the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 Homodimer Complex in Vitro and in Cells—The above experiments suggest that the IκBβ insert could mask the second (subunit B) NLS of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes in resting cells. Direct contact likely requires modification of one or both of these interacting elements. The small GTPase κB-Ras was recently shown to be involved in regulation of IκB degradation (36Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether κB-Ras might be involved in masking the NF-κB subunit B NLS, we have performed immunoprecipitation experiments with a monoclonal antibody directed against the p65 subunit NLS used to precipitate free p65, IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer binary complexes, and κBRas·IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer ternary complexes. In parallel experiments, IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer complexes were probed in the presence and absence of κB-Ras. The p65 from the immunoprecipitated complexes was then visualized by anti-p65 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 3A). We observe that both IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer and IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer complexes can be precipitated by the anti-p65 NLS antibody (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 7, respectively). Moreover, we observe that the addition of κB-Ras inhibits the ability of this antibody to bind to IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complexes but not IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 8). To determine whether the insert of IκBβ plays a role in NLS masking by κB-Ras, we performed similar immunoprecipitation experiments with IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p65 homodimer complexes in the presence and absence of κBRas. We observe that the addition of κB-Ras fails to enhance NLS masking of IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p65 homodimer complexes (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). To verify specificity of the anti-p65 NLS monoclonal antibody, we tested it against the IκBβ·NF-κB p50/p65 complex. The anti-p65 NLS antibody fails to recognize and precipitate p65 in these complexes. This results from the nearly complete masking of the p65 subunit A NLS polypeptide by IκBβ as observed in the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 complex crystal structure (Fig. 3A, lanes 9 and 10). To further investigate whether κB-Ras mediates blockade of the p65 NLS in cells, we next co-transfected 293 cells with HA-tagged p65 together with IκBα, IκBβ, or IκBβΔ-(152–192). We first confirmed that p65 associates with all three IκB proteins by co-immunoprecipitation using an antibody against the transcriptional activation domain of p65 (Fig. 3B). When the anti-p65 NLS antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, we observed that only IκBα and IκBβΔ-(152–192) were pulled down, but not wild type IκBβ. These experiments suggest that in IκBα·NF-κB p65 homodimer and IκBβΔ-(152–192) complexes, at least one p65 NLS is free, whereas both p65 subunit NLS polypeptides are blocked in the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex. We conclude that the IκBβ insert is required for masking of the NF-κB subunit B NLS and cytoplasmic retention of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. κB-Ras Directly Interacts with the IκBβ Insert—To identify the role of the IκBβ insert in κB-Ras binding, we have tested the binding of co-transfected κB-Ras and IκBβ in cells. COS cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing both wild type IκBβ and κB-Ras. We show that κB-Ras can be precipitated only when wild type IκBβ is present (Fig. 4). However, the association is not observed in cells expressing IκBβΔ-(152–192) and κB-Ras. Therefore, the IκBβ insert is required for association with κB-Ras. Taken together, these experiments suggest that the small GTPase κB-Ras may play an in vivo role in blocking the subunit B NLS of dimeric NF-κB by binding directly to the unique insert region of the IκBβ inhibitor protein. The IκBβ PEST Functions in Cytoplasmic Retention of IκBβ·NF-κB Complexes—Because κB-Ras was identified as an IκB-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen with the IκBβ C-terminal PEST used as the bait, it is important to evaluate the role of the IκBβ PEST in NF-κB cytoplasmic sequestration. To test whether phosphorylation of the IκBβ PEST plays any role in cytoplasmic retention of NF-κB, we mutated four phosphorylatable serines (Ser312, Ser313, Ser314, and Ser316) within this region to either alanine (PEST-Ala) or aspartic acid (PEST-Asp). Two serine residues in this region have been shown to be phosphorylated by casein kinase II, and phosphorylation at these sites is important for NF-κB binding in cells (39Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40McKinsey T.A. Chu Z.L. Ballard D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22377-22380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, we have previously shown that phosphorylation of these serines or their conversion to phosphomimetic glutamic acid residues does not alter the stability of IκBβ·NF-κB binary complexes in vitro (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). If constitutive phosphorylation of the PEST is important for stable complex formation, then substitution of these residues to alanine could prevent cytoplasmic retention of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. To test this possibility, we co-transfected HeLa cells with IκBβ-PEST-Ala and p65 and observed co-localization of both proteins in the cytoplasm. However, when these cells were treated with LMB followed by immunostaining, we observed that, in a large fraction of cells expressing both of these proteins, the complex localized to the nucleus (Fig. 5A). In contrast, when the cells were co-transfected with p65 and IκBβ-PEST-Asp, the complex was cytoplasmic with or without LMB treatment (Fig. 5B). This property of the IκBβ-PEST-Asp mutant complex is identical to that of the wild type complex. We conclude that IκBβ PEST phosphorylation is critical for cytoplasmic sequestration of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. We further created a mutant of IκBβ in which the insert is deleted within the background of phosphomimetic IκBβ-PESTAsp sequence ((IκBβΔ-(152–192)-PEST-Asp). When HeLa cells were co-transfected with this mutant and wild type p65, we observed that the complex shuttled between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5C). This profile is identical to that observed in the IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex. It is not immediately clear to us what role a phosphorylated IκBβ PEST plays in sequestering the IκBβ·NF-κB complexes to the cytosol. It is possible that κB-Ras interacts with both the IκBβ insert and phosphorylated PEST. It is also possible that the interaction between the IκBβ PEST and κB-Ras is indirect, mediated by another bridging factor. IκBβ·NF-κB complexes are cytoplasmic in quiescent cells (30Huang T.T.

This suggests that the NF-κB subunit B NLS can exhibit a binding mode, alternative to that observed in the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex crystal structure, in which it is completely masked (see Ref. 43Malek S.

We have tested this hypothesis derived from our structural analyses of IκB·NF-κB complexes by both in vitro and cell-based studies. Transient transfection and immunostaining experiments reveal that the unique and structurally disordered insert between the third and fourth ankyrin repeats of IκBβ functions to regulate nuclear import of the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex in resting cells. These experiments suggest that the insert functions as a nuclear export signal or blocks a nuclear localization sequence. No recognizable export sequence is observed within the IκBβ insert. Interestingly, IκBβΔ-(152–192)·NF-κB complexes shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, despite the lack of a nuclear export sequence in IκBβ. We suggest that the partially exposed NLS of NF-κB subunit B and the export potential of the p65 activation domain drive the dynamic shuttling behavior of these complexes (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7088-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We propose the hypothesis that κB-Ras may act in concert with the IκBβ insert to sequester IκBβ·NF-κB complexes to the cytoplasm. Indeed, we show that the small GTPase κB-Ras is able to reduce access to the NF-κB p65 homodimer subunit B NLS in complexes between p65 and IκBβ. We further present evidence that binding of κB-Ras to IκBβ requires the insert within the ankyrin repeat domain of IκBβ. Because this insert is unique to IκBβ, these results serve to explain the specificity of κB-Ras for the IκBβ·NF-κB complex. There are several published observations which suggest that phosphorylation of the IκBβ PEST might play an important role in regulation of NF-κB by IκBβ (7Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Weil R. Whiteside S.T. Israël A. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The most important of these is the identification of κB-Ras through the utilization of the IκBβ PEST sequence as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (36Fenwick C. Na S.Y. Voll R.E. Zhong H. Im S.Y. Lee J.W. Ghosh S. Science. 2000; 287: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that PEST phosphorylation is important for stable complex formation with NF-κB (39Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Qi X. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5974-5984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that PEST phosphorylation of IκBβ functions in cytoplasmic retention of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. Although we do not observe a clear need for PEST phosphorylation in the interaction between IκBβ and NF-κB or κB-Ras·IκBβ·NF-κB complex formation, our experiments do suggest that PEST phosphorylation cooperates with κB-Ras binding and the IκBβ insert in regulating cytosolic retention of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes. We propose that this cooperativity might be mediated through other cellular factors or through further post-translational modification elsewhere in the complex. We favor the first possibility in light of our recent findings that IκBβ is present in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells as large complexes, which include NF-κB and κB-Ras as well as other as-yet-unknown factors. 3Y. Chen, unpublished observation. Working together, the IκBβ insert and the PEST, one NF-κB NLS, and κB-Ras represent a molecular mechanism for switching between nuclear and cytoplasmic IκBβ·NF-κB complexes (Fig. 6). Our experiments help to explain the observation that hypophosphorylated IκBβ·NF-κB complexes can localize into the nucleus (7Suyang H. Phillips R. Douglas I. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5444-5449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that the hypophosphorylated form of IκBβ is functionally equivalent to the IκBβ-PEST-Ala protein construct used in this study. Finally, our results serve to explain one long-standing puzzle. It has long been thought that IκBα binds NF-κB dimers with a significantly higher affinity than does IκBβ. This conclusion was drawn based on the respective abilities of IκBα and IκBβ to inhibit NF-κB DNA binding. We have shown previously that compared with IκBα, IκBβ binds NF-κB p50/p65 heterodimer and p65 homodimer with only slightly weaker affinity (32Malek S. Chen Y. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45225-45235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 41Malek S. Huxford T. Ghosh G. J. Biol.

In light of the IκBβ·NF-κB p65 homodimer complex crystal structure and the biochemical evidence surrounding κB-Ras binding to IκBβ·NF-κB complexes, we suggest that the in vivo stabilities of IκBβ·NF-κB complexes are nearly equivalent to those of IκBα·NF-κB complexes. This would explain why both complexes are present in almost all cells in almost equal amounts (5Whiteside S.T. Epinat J.C. Rice N.R. Israël A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1413-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We thank H. Bantel and Roche Diagnostics for the generous gift of the anti-p65 NLS antibody, Dr. M.

It is induced upon engagement of CD40 on B lymphocytes by CD40L expressed by activated CD4+ T cells and exposure of B cells to T cell-secreted cytokines including interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor-β. It begins with germ line IH-CH transcription and unfolds through class switch DNA recombination (CSR). We show here that the HoxC4 and Oct-1 homeodomain proteins together with the Ku70/Ku86 heterodimer bind as a complex to newly identified switch (S) regulatory ATTT elements (SREs) in the Iγ and Iϵ promoters and downstream regions to dampen basal germ line Iγ-Cγ and Iϵ-Cϵ transcriptions and repress CSR to Cγ and Cϵ. This mechanism is inactive in the Cα1/Cα2 loci because of the lack of SREs in the Iα1/Iα2 promoters. Accordingly, in resting human IgM+IgD+ B cells, HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 can be readily identified as bound to the Iγ and Iϵ promoters but not the Iα1/Iα2 promoters. CD40 signaling dissociates the HoxC4·Oct-1·Ku complex from the Iγ and Iϵ promoter SREs, thereby relieving the IH-CH transcriptional repression and allowing CSR to unfold. Dissociation of HoxC4·Oct-1·Ku from DNA is hampered by CD153 engagement, a CD40-signaling inhibitor. Thus, these findings outline a HoxC4·Oct-1·Ku-dependent mechanism of selective regulation of class switching to IgG and IgE and further suggest distinct co-evolution and shared CSR activation pathways in the Cγ and Cϵ as opposed to the Cα1/Cα2 loci.

In CD40-induced (GC) B cells, germ line IH-CH transcription and CSR can be effectively down-regulated by bidirectional CD30:CD153-dependent signaling, which interferes with the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor molecules to CD40 and inhibits NF-κB activation (14Cerutti A.

Zan H. Ely S. Casali P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of germ line IH-CH transcription and CSR in general and in non-CD40-induced (pre-GC) B cells in particular remains to be defined. We report here a mechanism of selective inhibition of class switching to IgG and IgE. This mechanism relies on the binding of HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 to newly identified SREs that exists in the Iγ and Iϵ but not in the Iα1/Iα2 promoters. Such a binding dampens basal germ line Iγ-Cγ and Iϵ-Cϵ transcription and represses CSR to Cγ and Cϵ. It is potentiated by CD153 signaling and reversed by CD40 signaling. Thus, by selectively binding to the Iγ and Iϵ promoters, HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 differentially regulate class switching to IgG, IgE, and IgA and would minimize S region double-stranded DNA breaks, thereby contributing to the stability of the Ig H chain locus.

The sequence of the Sp1 oligonucleotide was 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. The SRE binding activity of CL-01 nuclear extracts (75 mg) was first enriched by 20–50% (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, dialyzed against DNA binding buffer (DBB) (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and then fractionated on a Centricon concentrator using a 100-kDa molecular mass cut-off membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The >100-kDa fraction was applied to a Superose 6 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), which was eluted at a 100 μl/min rate with DBB containing 20% glycerol. Fractions (500 μl) were collected and tested for SRE binding activity by EMSA. The SRE binding fractions were pooled and loaded onto a DAC column consisting of an agarose matrix bearing streptavidin (Pierce) and loaded with 5′-biotinylated pentamerized double-stranded Iγ3 5′-SRE or mutSRE oligonucleotides (Qiagen Sciences, Germantown, MD). The column was washed with 200 mm KCl DBB containing 20% glycerol. The DNA-bound proteins were eluted using a 300–800 mm KCl gradient in DBB 20% glycerol and collected in 500-μl fractions, which were monitored for SRE binding activity and protein content. Proteins were visualized in SDS-PAGE using the Rapid Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad). The fractions eluted at 300 mm KCl contained the strongest SRE binding activity and were pooled, concentrated on Centricon filters, and applied to SDS-PAGE. The resolved protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad), excised, and subjected to in-gel proteolysis by trypsin. Peptides mixtures were separated by a C8 reverse-phase column with a linear 0–60% CH3CN gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h. The molecular masses of the peptide mixtures were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using a Voyager-DE short tandem repeat (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA). The complete list of accurately measured masses of the tryptic peptides was used to search for protein candidates in the OWL protein sequence data base with the program ProFound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound). Internal sequencing of tryptic peptides was performed as described previously (25Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Sabatini D.M. Snyder S.H. Tempst P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2435-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Detection of Reciprocal Recombination SCs—Genomic DNA was extracted from B cells using the QIAmp DNA mini kit (Qiagen). Specific Sγ-Sμ, Sϵ-Sμ, and Sα-Sμ reciprocal SCs were amplified from genomic DNA (500 ng) using nested PCRs and Sμ, Sγ-(γ1–4), and Sα-(α1/α2) region-specific primers (17Cerutti A. Zan H. Schaffer A. Bergsagel L. Harindranath N. Max E.E. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2145-2157PubMed Google Scholar). PCR kinetics entailed a 1-min denaturation at 94 °C, a 1-min annealing at 68 °C, and a 4-min extension at 72 °C for two rounds of 30 cycles. Before each PCR, DNA was denatured for 5 min at 94 °C. The identity of PCR-amplified DNA was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using Sμ-specific SC probes (17Cerutti A. Zan H. Schaffer A. Bergsagel L. Harindranath N. Max E.E. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2145-2157PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase Treatment of Nuclear Extracts—Extracts prepared from freshly isolated human IgM+IgD+ B cells were incubated with 5 and 20 milliunits of acid phosphatase (Grade I, Roche Applied Sciences) in DBB in a final volume of 30 μlat25 °C for 10 min. A 10-μl aliquot of the phosphatase-treated sample was then tested in each binding assay. GST Proteins and Pull-down Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed, purified using GSH-agarose beads according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences), and analyzed for homogeneity by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. l-[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were translated using the TnT Quick coupled transcription/translation systems (Promega) method. For pull-down experiments, 5 μl of in vitro translated protein was mixed with 50 μg of nuclear extract and applied to GSH-agarose beads (20 μl) equilibrated in binding buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40). After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with buffer containing 150 mm KCl. Bound proteins were then eluted in SDS sample buffer, separated in SDS-PAGE, fixed, dried, and autoradiographed at –70 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation, Circular DNA Pull-down, and Immunoblotting Assays—Nuclear extracts (200 μg of protein in 500 μl of buffer B) were precipitated with indicated mAbs and Protein-G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or with CNBr-activated-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) bearing circular pBSK vector (1 μg of DNA/20 μl of bead) (Stratagene Corp.). For circular DNA pull-down assay, buffer B was supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) and WT or mutSRE oligonucleotides (50 ng). Pulled-down proteins were fractionated through 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, these membranes were blotted with mAbs to HoxC4, Oct-1, Ku70, and Ku86, washed, and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit Ab to mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After horseradish peroxidase addition, the specific proteins were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The whole cell extracts from tonsillar B cells were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blotted with mAbs to HoxC4, Ku70, Ku86, rabbit IgG to Oct-1, and actin (Sigma), washed, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey Ab to mouse IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat Ab to rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—Freshly isolated circulating human IgM+IgD+ B cells (2.5 × 107) were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link chromatin. After washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, chromatin was separated using nuclei-lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Trition-X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% Sarkosyl, pH 8.0), re-suspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors), and sonicated to yield 500–1000-bp DNA fragments. These were precleared with agarose beads bearing protein A or G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and then incubated with mAb to HoxC4, Ab to Oct-1, or mAb to Ku70/Ku86 overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were isolated using beads bearing protein A or G, eluted with “elution buffer” (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, pH 8.0), and then heated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links. DNA was recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and then solubilized in Tris-EDTA buffer. The recovered DNA was specified by cloning and sequencing of the PCR product amplified using the γ3 promoter forward (281–300, 5′-TGGTGCCGCCAGTTTCAATC-3′) and reverse (444–424, 5′-GTCTCAGCCCTTCCTGTTGTG-3′) primers, the Iϵ promoter forward (441–461, 5′-CCAAGAACAGAGAGAAAAGGG-3′) and reverse (615–598, 5′-ATCAGGCTGGGGAGAGTGAGTC-3′) primers, or the Iα promoter forward (172–193, 5′-ACAGGGTAGAGCAGGCACCTTG-3′) and reverse (353–332, 5′-ATCAGGCTGGGGAGAGTGAGTC-3′) primers. ATTT SREs Critically Modulate Iγ and Iϵ but Not Iα Promoter Activity—We have suggested the existence of a repression of germ line Iγ3-Cγ3 transcription in resting human IgM+IgD+ B cells (8Schaffer A. Cerutti A. Shah S. Zan H. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5327-5336PubMed Google Scholar) and tentatively ascribed it to Iγ3 promoter tetrameric ATTT SREs. In the Iγ1, Iγ2, Iγ3, and Iγ4 promoters, such SREs exist in two identical copies, one straddling the 5′ boundary of the IL-4-responsive element Stat6-binding site (IL-4 RE-Stat6) and the other straddling the 3′ boundary of the IL-4 RE-Stat6. Two SREs were also identified in the Iϵ promoter, both of them 3′ of the IL-4 RE-Stat6 (Fig. 1A). Additional ATTT motifs exist in the downstream IH-S regions and flanking areas: 3, 3, 2, 3, and 13 in the γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, and ϵ loci, respectively. No SRE was found in the Iα1/Iα2 promoters or Iα-Sα regions. Transfection of human IgM+IgD+ CL-01 B cells, our model of inducible CSR and somatic hypermutation (8Schaffer A. Cerutti A. Shah S. Zan H. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5327-5336PubMed Google Scholar, 17Cerutti A. Zan H. Schaffer A. Bergsagel L. Harindranath N. Max E.E. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2145-2157PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zan H. Cerutti A. Dramitinos P. Schaffer A. Li Z. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3437-3447PubMed Google Scholar), with Iγ or Iϵ promoter-driven luciferase gene reporter pGL3 vectors containing WT or mutated (ATTT to ggTT) mutSRE(s) was performed to analyze the role of these SREs in IH promoter activity (Fig. 1B). Mutation of both the 5′- and 3′-SREs (double mutSRE) in the Iγ and Iϵ promoters resulted in a 10-(Iγ2) to 15-fold (Iϵ) increase of basal reporter gene transcription and a 4-(Iγ2) to 6-fold (Iϵ) increase of human trimeric (ht) CD40L-induced transcription (Fig. 2). This possibly reflects the suboptimal induction of transfected CL-01 cells by soluble CD40L as underscored by our previous findings that similar culture conditions induce switching in approximately one-third of CL-01 cells (17Cerutti A. Zan H. Schaffer A. Bergsagel L. Harindranath N. Max E.E. Casali P. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2145-2157PubMed Google Scholar). The double mutSRE also reverted the ability of CD153 signaling to reduce the basal (no reduction in double mutSRE versus a25– 40% reduction in WT SRE) and htCD40L-induced Iγ and Iϵ promoter-driven reporter gene transcription (no reduction in double mutSRE versus a 79–84% reduction in WT SRE). Mutation of the 5′-SRE alone resulted in enhancement of basal and htCD40L-induced Iγ or Iϵ promoter-driven transcription that was 28–56% lower than that of the double mutSRE (data of supplemental Fig. 2A versus those of Fig. 2). Finally, the absence of the ATTT SRE in Iα1/Iα2 was associated with a significantly higher basal activity of this promoter as compared with the Iγ1, Iγ2, Iγ3, Iγ4, and Iϵ promoters (supplemental Fig. 2B). Thus, the ATTT SREs critically mediate basal and CD153-induced inhibition of Iγ and Iϵ promoter-driven transcription. Iγ and Iϵ SREs Recruit HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 — EMSAs were performed using radiolabeled oligonucleotides encompassing the Iγ3orIϵ 5′-SRE, the SRE immediately 5′ of the Sγ3 region (Sγ3 SRE) or the most 5′-SRE in the Sϵ region (Sϵ SRE), and nuclear extracts from freshly isolated human peripheral blood IgM+IgD+ B cells to characterize the trans-factors specifically binding to the identified Iγ and Iϵ SREs. Two specific and closely migrating SRE-protein complexes (complexes A and B) were identified by all of the four probes (Fig. 3A). The formation of such complexes was inhibited by cold WT but not mutSRE (ATTT to ggTT) oligonucleotides containing the Iγ1, Iγ2, Iγ3, Iγ4, Iϵ, Sγ3, or Sϵ 5′- or 3′-SRE (data not shown). To analyze the composition of complexes A and B, nuclear extracts from CL-01 IgM+IgD+ B cells were subjected to sequential (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, gel filtration, and SRE DNA affinity chromatography (DAC), which eventually yielded proteins of 100, 89, 72, and 34-kDa apparent molecular masses (Fig. 3, B-C). These proteins were identified as Oct-1, Ku86, Ku70, and HoxC4 by in-gel trypsin digestion, peptide mass fingerprinting, internal sequencing, and specific mAbs in eluates from a DAC column bearing SRE Iγ3 oligonucleotides (Fig. 3D, left panel). Additional proteins of 190, 144, and 120-kDa apparent molecular masses were also detected by silver staining, but they accounted for bands of minor intensity and were not sequenced (Fig. 3C). The binding of HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 to DNA was mediated specifically by the SRE and was not attributed to “stickiness” of these proteins for free DNA ends as shown by the following: (i) the failure of HoxC4, Oct-1, and Ku70/Ku86 to bind to a mutSRE DAC column (Fig. 3D, left panel); (ii) the efficient pull-do"

In soluble form, this antigen, Lewisy-6/H-5-2 (Ley/H), or its glucose analog, 2-fucosyllactose (H-2g), mediates angiogenesis. The Ley/H antigen is structurally related to the soluble E-selectin ligand, sialyl Lewisx, and is selectively expressed in skin, lymphoid organs, thymus, and synovium, suggesting that it may be important in leukocyte homing or adhesion. In the present study, we used H-2g as a functional substitute to demonstrate a novel property for Ley/H antigen in inducing leukocyte-endothelial adhesion. H-2g significantly enhanced the expression of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs) intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), but not vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting showed glycolipids Ley-6, H-5-2, or the glucose analog H-2g quickly activated human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and that the JAK2 inhibitor, AG-490, completely inhibited HMVEC ICAM-1 expression and HL-60 adhesion to HMEC-1s. Use of a JAK/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) profiling system confirmed that H-2g selectively activated STAT3 but not STAT1 and STAT2. AG-490 inhibited H-2g-induced Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt activation, suggesting that JAK2 is upstream of the Erk1/2 and PI3K-Akt pathways. Furthermore, the JAK2 inhibitor AG-490, the Erk1/2 inhibitor PD98059, or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directed against JAK2, Erk1/2, or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocked H-2g-induced HMVEC ICAM-1 expression and HL-60 adhesion to HMEC-1s. Hence, H-2g signals through JAK2 and its downstream signal transducers STAT3, Erk1/2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase result in ICAM-1 expression and cell adhesion.

Later we identified the 4A11 antigen as an endothelial cell (EC) molecule, Lewisy-6/H-5-2 (Ley/H), which is structurally related to the soluble E-selectin ligand, sialyl Lewisx (Lex) (1Koch A.E.

H structures are primarily known for their role as blood group antigens. Ley/H is mainly expressed on some epithelial cells and on the EC membrane. The antigen is selectively expressed on ECs of skin, lymphoid organs, thymus, and synovium. We also found that the Ley/H antigen was up-regulated in the skin of a human poison ivy dermatitis model before the ingress of inflammatory cells (1Koch A.E. Nickoloff B.J. Holgersson J. Seed B. Haines G.K. Burrows J.C. Leibovich S.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 244-259PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in human RA synovial tissue, the Ley/H endothelial antigen is up-regulated compared with normal synovial tissue. In soluble form, Ley/H is increased in inflammatory RA compared with non-inflammatory osteoarthritis synovial fluids. In vitro cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which are important in inflammatory states, up-regulate the expression of Ley/H on ECs. We have identified 2-fucosyllactose, a readily available glucose analog of H-5-2, termed H-2g, as a potent mediator of angiogenesis, thus potentially contributing to the growth and proliferation of the RA synovial pannus. Taken together, our results suggest that Ley/H may contribute to cellular ingress or adhesion in inflammatory states like RA. The importance of glycoconjugates in inflammation has recently been described by Maly and co-workers (3Lacha J. Bushell A. Smetana K. Rossmann P. Pribylova P. Wood K. Maly P. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 311-318PubMed Google Scholar), who found that mice deficient in the enzymes that generate sialyl-Lex have a partial defect in neutrophil accumulation in response to an acute inflammatory stimulus. If H-2g does exert an effect on cell adhesion, we hypothesized that the 4A11 antigen itself may function as an adhesion molecule or in soluble form induce cell adhesion molecule expression. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is constitutively expressed on ECs and other cells. It is up-regulated transcriptionally by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1 (4Lindsley H.B. Smith D.D. Cohick C.B. Koch A.E. Davis L.S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 68: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Increased EC expression of ICAM-1 in tissues promotes the recruitment of inflammatory cells expressing its ligand, leukocyte function antigen-1 and CD11a/CD18 (5Porter J.C. Hogg N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of ICAM-1 has been shown in joints and serum of RA patients (6Tak P.P. Thurkow E.W. Daha M.R. Kluin P.M.

Immunol. 1999; 50: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously that ICAM-1 expression on RA synovial tissue ECs is significantly higher compared with normal synovial ECs, suggesting that ICAM-1 promotes leukocyte adhesion and invasion into the RA joint (8Koch A.E. Shah M.R. Harlow L.A. Lovis R.M. Pope R.M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 71: 208-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Szekanecz Z. Haines G.K. Lin T.R. Harlow L.A. Goerdt S. Rayan G. Koch A.E. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathways have been reported to be involved in many signaling events such as the immune response-induced cytokines and in the actions of growth factors and hormones (10Ihle J.N. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Yamamoto K. Thierfelder W.E. Kreider B. Silvennoinen O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 222-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Specific subtypes of JAK (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2) are activated by different signals, directing the specificity of response (11Kisseleva T. Bhattacharya S. Braunstein J. Schindler C.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand to its receptor induces assembly of an active receptor complex and consequent phosphorylation of the receptor-associated JAKs. Phosphorylated JAKs lead to the activation of neighboring JAK receptor subunits and several other substrates. JAK-triggered receptor phosphorylation potentially functions via activation of the STAT signaling pathway, Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway after the interaction of cytokine/interferon receptors with their ligands (12Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Aberrations in JAK kinase activity that may lead to derailment of one or more of the above-mentioned pathways disrupt normal cellular responses and result in disease states. Optimal JAK activity is a critical determinant of normal transmission of cytokine and growth factor signals. Here we show a novel function for Ley/H as a mediator of leukocyte-EC adhesion via induction of EC ICAM-1. Moreover, we demonstrate that the mechanisms underlying Ley/H-induced ICAM-1 expression and cell adhesion include triggering of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. We propose these pathways are correlated with the development of inflammation in RA.

Media was removed, and cells were fixed in 100 μl of 3.7% formalin, PBS at 37 °C for 15 min. The plates were carefully washed with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20. Plates were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 30% goat serum. Mouse anti-human ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, or P-selectin diluted in blocking buffer were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS plus 0.5% Tween 20, polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate diluted (1:1000) in blocking buffer was applied, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice, and 200 μl/well 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added. H2SO4 (1 n) was used to stop the reaction after 15 min. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Quiescent HMEC-1 cells were treated with 100 nm H-2g in the presence and absence of AG-490 for the specified times at 37 °C. An IL-4 (10 ng/ml)/TNF-α (1.15 nm) combination was use as the positive control. Alternatively, glycolipids Ley-6 (100 nm) or H-5-2 (100 nm) were used as stimulants. The cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 20 nm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 nm EDTA, 1 nm β-dithiothreitol, 50 nm glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 nm sodium orthovanadate, and 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with appropriate antibodies at 4 °C for 2 h. The antibody-protein complexes were incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B/protein A/G plus agarose beads overnight at 4 °C, and antibody-protein complexes bound to the beads were pelleted at 2000 × g for 2 min. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed as described previously (14Morel J.C. Park C.C. Woods J.M. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37069-37075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Pathway Profiling Luciferase Reporter Assay—The JAK/STAT signaling profile system from Clontech was employed for this study. The plasmid containing a STAT3 element tagged with a luciferase expression gene, pSTAT3-TA-Luc, an interferon-γ activation sequence (GAS) tagged with a luciferase expression gene, pGAS-TA-Luc, or an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) tagged with a luciferase expression gene, pISRE-TA-Luc, were transfected into HMEC-1s. HMEC-1s were seeded at 2.50 × 105 cells/well in 35-mm 6-well plates and cultured overnight to 75% confluence. Thirty minutes before transfection, the media was changed to fresh complete EBM media. One μg of pSTAT3-TA-Luc, pGAS-TA-Luc, or pISRE-TA-Luc or pTA-Luc combined with 0.2 μg of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid p-EGFP-N1 was added to Eppendorf tubes with 14.5 μl of 2 m calcium chloride and double-distilled H2O to a total volume of 100 μl (DNA-Ca2+ mixture). Hepes-buffered saline solution (2×, 100 μl) in Eppendorf tubes was carefully and slowly vortexed while adding 100 μl of DNA-Ca2+ mixture. The resultant mixture (200 μl) was placed at room temperature for 20 min and then added dropwise onto the cells. The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in an incubator gassed with 5% CO2. The cells were then washed with pre-warmed PBS once and fed with fresh medium. Fourteen h later the cells were stimulated with 100 nm H-2g or 1 ng/ml recombinant human IL-6 (positive control) for 6 h. After stimulation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, 200 μl of cell lysis buffer was added to cells, and the cells were shaken at 4 °C for 20 min. The cells was scraped into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and spun at 14,000 rpm at room temperature for 1 min to remove cell debris. Forty μl of cell extract was added to the wells, and 50 μl of substrate A and 50 μl of substrate B were added to the plate, and the luciferase activities were measured in a luminometer. GFP expression was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and efficiency was calculated by the percentage of positive expression. Preparation of Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Extracts for Western Blotting—Quiescent HMEC-1 cells treated with 100 nm H-2g for 5, 10, and 30 min were scraped off the plate, washed with PBS twice at 4 °C, resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm benzamidine, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and put on ice for 10 min. Two μlof20% Nonidet P-40 was added, the mixture was vortexed for 10 s and pelleted for 30 s, the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract) was collected and stored at–70 °C for Western blotting. The nuclear extracts were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 mm benzamidine, 1.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), rocked for 15 min in 4 °C, and pelleted at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants containing the nuclear extract were stored at–70 °C for Western blotting. Immunofluorescence Assay—HMEC-1 cells were seeded on sterile slide coverslips in 6-well plates overnight and allowed to achieve quiescence for 6 h in EBM with 0.1% FBS. Quiescent HMEC-1 cells were stimulated for the indicated times with H-2g (100 nm) or with PBS as a control. Cells were then washed once with PBS and fixed in–20 °C cold methanol for 10 min. Rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 (1:200 in PBS) as primary antibody was added dropwise on the coverslips. The plates were kept at 37 °C for 45 min and washed with 3× PBS. Goat anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (1:200 in PBS) as the secondary antibody was added dropwise on the coverslips. The plates were kept in 37 °C for another 45 min, washed with 3× PBS, and mounted with fluorescence mounting medium on slides. The slides were kept in–20 °C in the dark for fluorescence detection. A Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope was used to detect the translocation of phospho-STAT3. Cell Adhesion Assay—96-well plates (Dynex Technologies, Billingshurst, UK) were placed under UV light for 30 min and coated with 0.02% sterile gelatin. HMEC-1s were plated into the 96-well plates at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Cells were stimulated with or without 100 nm H-2g or 1.15 nm TNF-α (positive control) for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HL-60 cells were washed twice with PBS and adjusted to 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 without FBS. HL-60 cells were incubated with 5 μm calcAM for 30 min at 37 °C (calcAM is a fluorescent dye that is incorporated into living cells). HL-60 cells were then washed twice with pre-warmed RPMI 1640, 1% penicillin/streptomycin to remove unincorporated dye and then adjusted to 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. Labeled HL-60 cells (2.5 × 105/100 μl) were added to each well. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then washed very carefully four times with pre-warmed PBS. Fluorescence was determined using a fluorescent plate reader (SpectraMAX Gemini, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) set to 495 nm for excitation and 517 nm for emission. Adhesion was automatically expressed in relative fluorescence units. For better comparisons of the differentially treated groups and to avoid the use of relative fluorescence units, the adhesion of HL-60 cells to non-stimulated HMEC-1 cells was chosen as a reference. The adhesion index was, therefore, defined as the ratio of adhesion of HL-60 to stimulated HMEC-1 (in relative fluorescence units) to adhesion of HL-60 to unstimulated HMEC-1 (in relative fluorescence units). For experiments in which the adhesion to HMEC-1 cells was blocked by antibodies, cells were treated with mAbs to ICAM-1, VCAM-1, P-selectin, E-selectin, or isotype mouse-matched control (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HL-60 cells were labeled with calcAM and added to the HMEC-1 cells as described above (14Morel J.C. Park C.C. Woods J.M. Koch A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37069-37075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—For statistical evaluation of all experiments, Student's t tests were performed. Asterisks indicate significantly different values (*, p < 0.05). H-2g Induces HMVEC ICAM-1 Expression—Our previous work has shown that molecules such as VCAM-1 and E-selectin expressed on ECs may be shed. The shed molecules in turn bind adjacent ECs via their respective ligands and exert direct cell effects on ECs or leukocytes mediating inflammation and angiogenesis (15Koch A.E. Halloran M.M. Haskell C.J. Shah M.R. Polverini P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Ley/H is expressed on the EC surface and also circulates in soluble form. Because of the selective expression of Ley/H in organs often targeted by inflammation, such as the joint synovial tissue in RA, we hypothesized that Ley/H might be involved in inflammatory cell adhesion. To examine the hypothesis, we studied HMVEC cell adhesion molecule expression in response to glycolipids Ley-6 (100 nM), H-5-2 (100 nM), or H-5-2 glucose analog H-2g using a cell based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We examined E-selectin, P-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 expression. Ley-6, H-5-2, and H-2g induced ICAM-1 expression. Ley-6 had the most potent effect. Because H-2g acted similarly to the native glycolipid antigens, we used H-2g in subsequent experiments. We examined H-2g-induced HMVEC ICAM-1 expression after 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 h of stimulation with 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nM H-2g. We found that H-2g induced ICAM-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner beginning at 10 nM (Fig. 1A). The peak time of H-2g-induced HMVEC ICAM-1 expression was 6 h. In contrast, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and P-selectin were not induced (Fig. 1B). PBS was used as a negative control, and 1.15 nM TNF-α was used as a positive control. We employed the Erk1/2 inhibitor (PD98059), the PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), the Src inhibitor (PP2), and the JAK2 inhibitor (AG-490) before (6 h) and during the experiment and found that the Erk1/2 inhibitor, the PI3K inhibitor, and the JAK inhibitor blocked ICAM-1 expression induced by H-2g. AG-490 had the most dramatic effect among these three inhibitors and completely inhibited HMVEC ICAM-1 expression induced by H-2g, suggesting that JAK2 was a key signaling intermediate (Fig. 1C). H-2g Stimulates JAK2 Kinase Activity in HMEC-1s—The JAK2 inhibitor AG-490 inhibited HMVEC ICAM-1 expression induced by H-2g, suggesting that JAK kinases might play a critical role in the signaling triggered by H-2g. To examine the contributions of the different JAK kinases to H-2g-induced EC ICAM-1 expression, we immunoprecipitated JAKs from HMEC-1s with antibodies directed against JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, or JAK3 after H-2g stimulation. To assure that all JAKs were activated, an IL-4 (10 ng/ml)/TNF-α (1.15 nM) combination was used as the positive control. We probed for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with 4G10 (anti-phosphotyrosine mAb). The blots were stripped and re-probed for nonphosphorylated protein. We observed that unlike other JAKs and Tyk2, JAK2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 min after treatment with H-2g (Fig. 2A). H-2g-activated JAK2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of H-2g-stimulated cell lysates probed with a phospho-specific anti-JAK2 antibody, which demonstrated maximal phosphorylation of JAK2 at 1 min (8.3 ± 1.6-fold increase) (Fig. 2B). Purified native Ley/H antigen up-regulated JAK2 in the same manner as H-2g did (Fig. 2C). Phospho-JAK2 Kinase Up-regulates Phospho-STAT3, Which Translocates Quickly into the Nucleus—We next examined which STATs were downstream of the H-2g-induced endothelial JAK2 pathway. We employed a signaling pathway profiling system. As shown in Fig. 3A, STAT3, but not STAT1 or STAT2, are involved in the phospho-JAK2 pathway. To determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins in response to treatment with H-2g was accompanied by translocation into the nucleus, Western blot analyses of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of H-2g-treated HMEC-1 cells was performed. H-2g induced nuclear translocation of STAT3 in 5 min, an increase that was sustained for 30 min, whereas no discernible change was observed in the protein levels in the cytoplasmic fraction, suggesting that all STAT3 activated by H-2g was translocated to the nucleus quickly and had no effect on the phospho-STAT3 level in the cytoplasmic fraction. The total cell lysates with non-fractionated cells were also blotted with phospho-STAT3 antibody. The results are shown in Fig. 3B. STAT3 activated by H-2g translocated to nucleus in 5 min, and the effect was still present but diminished at 30 min (Fig. 3B). To confirm this result, we employed an immunofluorescence assay. We labeled the H-2g stimulated or non-stimulated HMEC-1s with anti-phospho-STAT3 (1:200 in PBS) as primary antibody and the goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:200 in PBS) as secondary antibody. A Zeiss LSM510 laser-scanning confocal microscope was used to detect the translocation of phospho-STAT3. Phospho-STAT3 was activated and translocated to the nucleus in 5 min, which is consistent with our previous Western blot results. Activated STAT3 entered the nucleus and persisted for 30 min (Fig 3C). STAT3 activation is dependent on phosphorylation of JAK2. Results indicate that the period of STAT3 activation and transient translocation is shorter than JAK2 activation. Similar results were shown in several other studies (16Madamanchi N.R. Li S.

Gangliosides induce brain microglial cell nitric-oxide synthase, ICAM-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression through JAK-STAT pathways; JAK2 activation persisted for 60 min, whereas STAT3 activation diminished after 30 min"

In addition, dUTPase has an essential role as a safeguard against uracil incorporation in DNA. The putative dCTP deaminase (MJ0430) and dUTPase (MJ1102) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii were overproduced in Escherichia coli. Unexpectedly, we found the MJ0430 protein capable of both reactions, i.e. hydrolytic deamination of the cytosine ring and hydrolytic cleavage of the phosphoanhydride bond between the α- and β-phosphates. When the reaction was followed by thin layer chromatography using [3H]dCTP as substrate, dUMP and not dUTP was identified as a reaction product. In the presence of unlabeled dUTP, which acted as an inhibitor, no label was transferred from [3H]dCTP to the pool of dUTP. This finding strongly suggests that the two consecutive steps of the reaction are tightly coupled within the enzyme. The hitherto unknown bifunctionality of the MJ0430 protein appears beneficial for the cells because the toxic intermediate dUTP is never released. The MJ0430 protein also catalyzed the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP but with a low affinity for the substrate (Km >100 μm). According to limited proteolysis, the C-terminal residues constitute a flexible region. The other protein investigated, MJ1102, is a specific dUTPase with a Km for dUTP (0.4 μm) comparable in magnitude with that found for previously characterized dUTPases. Its physiological function is probably to degrade dUTP derived from other reactions in nucleotide metabolism.

Its physiological function is probably to degrade dUTP derived from other reactions in nucleotide metabolism. The biosynthesis of the thymidine nucleotide precursor for DNA occurs in all organisms by the reductive transfer of a methylene group from N5,N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to dUMP, catalyzed by thymidylate synthases (1Neuhard J.

Subsequently, dTMP is phosphorylated to dTDP and dTTP by dTMP kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively. In both pro- and eukaryotic systems, dUMP is predominantly generated from deoxycytidine nucleotides via deamination (1Neuhard J. Kelln R.A. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Linn E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

In Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, the deamination is catalyzed by a dCTP deaminase, whereas in Gram-positive bacteria like Bacillus subtilis and in eukaryotic organisms, dUMP is derived directly from dCMP by dCMP deaminases. The enzyme dCTP deaminase was first characterized from the enteric bacterium, Salmonella typhimurium (4Beck C.F. Eisenhardt A.R. Neuhard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 609-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligomeric enzyme showed sigmoid saturation kinetics, and the sigmoidity increased in the presence of dTTP, the end product of the pathway. Product inhibition by dUTP was also significant. Recent analyses of the overproduced E. coli enzyme showed that the enzyme does not contain bound metal, 1J. Neuhard, unpublished results. in contrast to most other enzymes capable of deaminating the cytosine ring like (deoxy)cytidine deaminase, dCMP deaminase, and RNA editing (C to U) enzymes, which contain firmly bound catalytic zinc, and cytosine deaminase, which contains iron. dUTPase is a ubiquitous and well characterized enzyme with the essential function of preventing uracil misincorporation into DNA. Amino acid sequence analyses display five conserved motifs within the relatively short subunits of about 150 residues (although exceptions occur among viruses and parasites). Four quite similar crystal structures of dUTPases, from eubacteria, retroviruses, and man, show a unique homotrimeric arrangement where each of the three active sites are formed by contributions from all three subunits: motifs 1, 2, and 4 from subunit A, motif 3 from subunit B, and motif 5 from subunit C (5Cedergren-Zeppezauer E.S.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two enzymes, dCTP deaminase and dUTPase, catalyze two consecutive steps in deoxynucleotide metabolism (dCTP>dUTP>dUMP), and an evolutionary relationship, also comprising pseudouridine synthases, was first suggested by Koonin (11Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2411-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Homology was especially noted for the sequence referred to as motif 3 in the dUTPases, where the residues form a β-hairpin structure responsible for binding the deoxyuridine moiety. All of the enzymes bind and transform pyrimidine nucleotides, and the relationship is supported by similarities in amino acid sequence to an extent that has confused the annotations of genes from sequenced archaeal genomes. Most archaeons had, until recently, two genes annotated as dCTP deaminases but no dUTPase. Two archaeal dUTPases have, so far, been conclusively identified. The first was reported for the Sulfolobus islandicus rod-shaped virus SIRV (12Prangishvili D. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6024-6029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the second was from Pyrococcus furiosis (13Hogrefe H.H. Hansen C.J. Scott B.R. Nielson K.B. Proc.

(12Prangishvili D. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol.

Because archaeal dCTP deaminase and dUTPase sequences appeared to differ from counterparts in the two other domains of life, eubacteria and eukaryotes, we decided to determine the catalytic capacity of the MJ1102 and MJ0430 gene products. In the present work, we confirm the previous assignment (12Prangishvili D. Klenk H.-P. Jakobs G. Schmiechen A. Hanselmann C. Holz I. Zillig W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6024-6029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and show that the MJ1102 gene product is a specific dUTPase, whereas the MJ0430 protein is a bifunctional enzyme possessing both dCTP deaminase and dUTPase activity. [3H]dUTP and [3H]dCTP were from Amersham Biosciences. Unlabeled nucleotides Q-Sepharose and Red-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Corp. The polyethyleneimine TLC plates were prepared according to Randerath and Randerath (14Randerath K. Randerath E. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12A: 323-347Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). E. coli XL1Blue (Promega) was used for all clonings, and E. coli BL21(DE3) was used for recombinant protein overproduction. The two genes MJ1102 and MJ0430 were amplified by PCR from genomic M. jannaschi DNA obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 43067) with primers introducing restriction endonuclease sites for NdeI and BamHI before the start codon and after the stop codon, respectively. After purification on QIAquick mini columns (Qiagen) and digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the fragments (514 and 638 bp) were cloned into plasmid pET-3a (15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar), yielding pET-3a/MJ1102 and pET-3a/MJ0430. DNA sequencing of both strands of the cloned inserts revealed no differences when compared with the published sequences (16Bult C.J. White O. Olsen G.J. Zhou L. Fleischmann R.D. Sutton G.G.

At an optical density at 600 nm of ∼1.0, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the medium at a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and incubation was continued with shaking at 37 °C overnight. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and frozen and thawed three times, yielding permeabilized cells. The chromatography steps were carried out at room temperature, and the centrifugations (4 °C) were performed in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. dCTP Deaminase—Cells from three induced 250-ml cultures of the strain carrying pET-3a/MJ0430, grown as described above, were suspended in 150 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether) N,N′-tetraacetic acid, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell suspension was incubated at 75 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 30 min. The cleared extract was loaded on a Q-Sepharose column (2.6 × 12 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After washing the column with 100 ml of buffer A, elution was performed using a linear NaCl gradient from 0 to 0.25 m in 500 ml of buffer A. Peak fractions, essentially free of contaminating protein as judged by SDS-PAGE, were loaded and chromatographed on a Red-Sepharose column (1.0 × 9 cm), equilibrated in buffer B (25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). UV-absorbing material was observed in the flow-through and during wash of the column (by 15 ml of buffer B), and elution was achieved by a gradient from 0 to 2 m KCl in 65 ml of buffer B. Peak fractions (eluted at 0.8–1.0 M KCl) were concentrated to about 20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration in a Centriprep tube (Amicon, Inc.) and stored a 4 °C. The enzyme was quantified by using its theoretical extinction coefficient (A280–320) 25,010 m–1 cm–1, and the final yield from 750 ml of cell culture was estimated to be 45 mg. dUTPase—Cells from an induced 25-ml culture of strain BL21(DE3) carrying pET-3a/MJ1102 were suspended in 5 ml of extraction buffer, heat-treated, and centrifuged as above. The supernatant was applied on a DE-52 column (2 ml), and the protein was eluted in isocratic steps by NaCl in buffer A. The purest fraction, eluted with 100 mm NaCl, was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm Bicine, 2The abbreviation used is: Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. pH 8.2. The protein concentration was assessed by the method of Kalb and Bernlohr (19Kalb V.F. Bernlohr R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 82: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) from absorbance at 230 and 260 nm. SDS-PAGE containing 15% polyacrylamide in the resolving gel was run using a Mini Protean II equipment from Bio-Rad. Samples of overproduced protein from permeabilized cells were blotted onto a poly-vinylidene difluoride membrane (Polyscreen; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to standard procedures (20Matsudaira P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Edman degradation was performed by Ingrid Dahlqvist (Clinical Chemistry Laboratory at Malmö University Hospital) on an Applied Biosystems 494 gas phase sequenator. Samples for mass spectrometry were transferred to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the analyses were performed by Michael Nielsen and Krestine Greve at the Department of Protein Chemistry of Copenhagen University using a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry instrument (Bruker Biflex III). The protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (sinapinic acid in 35% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). All assays were conducted at 25 °C unless otherwise stated, and the activity parameter for purified enzyme is given as turnover number (s–1). For the dUTPase assay on permeabilized cells, activity is expressed as mmol of dUTP hydrolyzed per min per liter of bacterial culture. dCTP Deaminase Assay 1—The reaction volume was 50 μl in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 5 mm MgCl2 (assay buffer). Enzyme concentration was typically 2 μm, and the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm [3H]dCTP (2 μCi/μmol). At intervals, 5-μl samples of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and applied to TLC plates. Prior to application, 20 nmol each of dUTP, dCTP, dUMP, and dCMP and 200 nmol of EDTA were added to the start points 3 cm above the lower edge of the plate. The plates were developed stepwise in one dimension as follows: (i) 1 m HAc for ∼1 min, (ii) 0.9 m HAc and 0.3 m LiCl to 3 cm above the start line, and (iii) 1 m HAc and 1.3 m LiCl to 14 cm above the start line. After development, the plates were washed in absolute methanol for 5 min and dried with hot air, and the marker spots were identified by UV light. The spots were cut out and placed in scintillation vials, and 0.7 ml of 2 m NH3 was added to elute nucleotides from the layers before determination of their radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The Rf values for dUTP, dCTP, dUMP, and dCMP were 0.25, 0.34, 0.64, and 0.78, respectively. dUDP and dCDP, which may occur as contaminants in the triphosphate markers, showed Rf values of 0.47 and 0.54, respectively. dCTP Deaminase Assay 2—This assay, mainly used to locate active fractions during purification, is based on the large shift in absorbance at 290 nm upon deamination of the cytosine ring to uracil at acidic pH (ΔE290 = 10,300 m–1 cm–1, pH 2.0). The reaction mixtures contained 2 mm dCTP in assay buffer, and the reaction was started by the addition of enzyme. After 30 and 60 min, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 1.0 ml of 0.5 m perchloric acid, and the absorbance at 290 nm was measured. dCTP Deaminase Assay 3—This assay was used for continuous measurements. In kinetic experiments the dCTP concentration was varied between 10 and 500 μm. Absorbances were recorded at 282 or 290 nm in assay buffer (pH 6.8) in which the ΔE282 and ΔE290 for the deamination of dCTP were 3500 and 1900 m–1 cm–1, respectively. dUTPase Assay 1—Permeabilized cells were assayed for dUTPase activity with [3H]dUTP as previously described (21Tye B.-K.

The assay mixture contained 0.9 mm dUTP in 0.2 m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the assay temperature was 80 °C. After 10 min, the reaction product [3H]dUMP was separated from the substrate by TLC in 1.0 m formic acid containing 0.5 m LiCl, and the number of counts in the dUMP and dUTP spots was determined (22Bergman A.-C.

Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). dUTPase Assay 2—To determine the initial rate and Km for dUTP, the spectrophotometric method of Larsson et al. (9Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used. Protons released by hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP were monitored in a weakly buffered solution in the presence of a pH indicator. Prior to kinetic measurements, the enzyme was passed through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Corp.) equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm Bicine, pH 8.2. The reactions were performed in 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 250 μm Bicine, pH 8.2, with 25 μm cresol red as indicator, and the decrease in absorbance at 573 nm was recorded. During the course of the reaction, the decrease was not more than 0.2 absorbance units, corresponding to a decrease of less than 0.2 pH units within the pH range of 7.8–8.2. The reaction trace, which represents a large number of initial rate determinations, was evaluated using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation and nonlinear regression (9Larsson G. Nyman P.O. Kvassman J.-O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24010-24016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, a Windows-based program, IMMFitter, 3J. Nord, personal communication. which also employs the Lambert omega function, was used (23Nord, J.

Expression of Recombinant Proteins—In M. jannaschii, the MJ0430 and MJ1102 genes encode proteins of 204 and 161 amino acid residues (23.4 and 18.6 kDa), respectively. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the genes indicated that they harbor a large number of codons rarely used in E. coli. For instance, the 9 arginine residues of the MJ1102 open reading frame are encoded by either AGA or AGG. Therefore, a helper plasmid, pRI952, providing tRNA for the rare isoleucine codon AUA and for the two rare arginine codons, AGA and AGG, was initially included in the expression host. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced overnight cultures, carrying the constructs pET-3a/MJ0430 and pET-3a/MJ1102 in both E. coli BL21(DE3) and in its pRI952 derivative, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As a negative control, pET-3a without insert was used. As shown in Fig. 1, the MJ1102 gene caused induction of an 18-kDa protein (lane 5) in agreement with the deduced size of the open reading frame carried on the recombinant plasmid. The presence of the MJ0430 gene induced a 28-kDa peptide (lane 4), which was significantly larger than the 23.4 kDa predicted from the nucleotide sequence. In the BL21(DE3)/pRI952 host, the induced bands at 18 and 28 kDa were likewise observed, although at somewhat lower intensities (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, a strong band at 25 kDa was reproducibly observed in conjunction with the pET-3a/MJ1102 construct (Fig. 1, lane 2). Most likely, this band corresponded to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase subunit (25 kDa) encoded by the cat gene present on pRI952. However, we have no explanation for why it was not observed with the MJ0430 construct or the negative control (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). Edman Degradation—The three strongly overproduced polypeptides seen in Fig. 1 were subjected to Edman degradation. From the N-terminal sequence, MEKKITGYT, the 25-kDa protein (lane 2) was identified as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The sequence MILSDKDIID was obtained from the 28-kDa protein (lane 4) in agreement with the sequence encoded by the MJ0430 gene. The N terminus (MVVKLMIIGA) of the 18-kDa protein (lane 5) conformed to the MJ1102 gene, but about one-third of the protein molecules retained the methionine (143 pmol) as the first residue, whereas the rest started with valine (237 pmol), generating two overlaying but interpretable sequences through the degradation. According to the general rules for processing (24Tsunasawa S. Stewart J.W. Sherman F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5382-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), removal of an N-terminal methionine is to be expected when followed by a valine residue. The inhomogeneiety observed may cause problems for a future determination of the three-dimensional structure. Assays of Permeabilized Cells—Permeabilized cells were assayed for dUTPase activity using Assay 1. The incubations were carried out at 80 °C, a temperature at which the endogeneous E. coli dUTPase is inactive. Unexpectedly, both pET-3a/MJ0430 and pET-3a/MJ1102 supported dUTPase activity (Table I). The presence of plasmid pRI952 did not improve the level of activity for the two constructs, and it was abandoned in all further studies.Table IdUTPase activity of induced permeabilized cellsConstructdUTPase activityaPermeabilized cells were analysed with dUTPase Assay 1 at 80 °C.

Open table in a new tab The ability of the various constructs to mediate deamination of dCTP was tested by incubating the permeabilized cells with dCTP at 80 °C for 1 h. A complete shift, from a cytosine to a uracil spectrum, was observed with extracts from cells harboring pET-3a/MJ0430, whereas extracts of strains containing pET-3a or pET-3a/MJ1102 did not result in any change of the dCTP spectrum. None of the extracts catalyzed the deamination of dCMP, as measured spectrophotometrically. Thus, it was concluded that the gene product of MJ0430 was a dCTP deaminase/dUTPase and that of MJ1102 was a dUTPase. Molecular Properties of Purified dCTP Deaminase—The dCTP deaminase was purified to homogeneity in three steps: heat treatment, chromatography on Q-Sepharose, and finally chromatography on Red-Sepharose as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and EDTA were included in all steps to avoid an apparently specific degradation reducing the size of the polypeptide chain from 28 kDa stepwise toward an end product of 26 kDa. According to matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, the mass of the purified enzyme was 23,331 Da, whereas the predicted mass calculated from the DNA sequence was 23,432 Da. These two figures, differing by 101 Da, are in reasonable agreement because the experimental error from the instrument is between 0.1 and 0.5%. The proteolytically degraded form of the enzyme from an early purification attempt was stable toward further proteolysis and lacked both dCTP deaminase and dUTPase activity. Its mass of 21,212 Da from matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry suggested a loss of 15–20 residues. The N terminus of the degraded form was intact according to Edman degradation (MILSDKDIID), indicating that the cleavage site(s) mapped to the C terminus. This may indicate that the C-terminal residues are located on a flexible part of the molecule, a feature previously observed for trimeric dUTPases (25Vertessy B.G. Proteins: Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 28: 568-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Shao H. Robek M.D. Threadgill D.S. Mankowski L.S. Cameron C.E. Fuller F.J. Payne S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Reaction Products from [3H]dCTP—As mentioned above, assays of permeabilized cells demonstrated that the MJ0430 protein catalyzed deamination of dCTP, but the spectral analyses did not provide identification of the reaction product. The activity of purified MJ0430 protein was analyzed with dCTP deaminase Assay 1 in which the separation on TLC was designed to identify the possible reaction products from [3H]dCTP. Throughout the reaction, all label that disappeared from dCTP was found in dUMP. No radioactivity was detected in dUTP or dCMP. Thus, dUTP or dCMP did not accumulate as intermediates of the reaction. In a parallel experiment, the reaction with [3H]dCTP (1 mM) was carried out in the presence of unlabeled dUTP (1 mm) (Fig. 2). The rate of the reaction (disappearance of dCTP) was lower (0.2 compared with 0.3 s–1), because of inhibition by dUTP, but again no label was found in the spots corresponding to dUTP and dCMP. Throughout the reaction, all counts disappearing from dCTP could be accounted for in dUMP (Fig. 2). This showed that the presumed first reaction product from dCTP deamination, i.e. dUTP, did not equilibrate with external dUTP. It cannot be ruled out that both chemical transformations occur in a concerted reaction without dUTP as an intermediate. However, because dUTP was accepted as a substrate with high turnover, this seems less likely. Kinetics of the dCTP Deaminase Reaction—The deamination reaction showed an absolute dependence on Mg2+ activity (data not shown), so Mg2+ was present in excess in all assays. A progress curve of the deamination of 2 mm dCTP is shown in Fig. 3. The extended linear phase (0–15 min), representing saturation with substrate, was used to calculate a turnover number of 0.3 s–1 at 25 °C. At 75 °C, a similar assay indicated a rate of 5 s–1, i.e. almost 20-fold higher. Assay 3 was employed to make initial rate measurements over a range of dCTP concentrations. The sigmoid shape of the saturation curve indicated that the enzyme did not follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics under these conditions (Fig. 4). Half saturation (S0.5) was obtained at about 40 μm dCTP, and the Hill coefficient was 1.9, suggesting positive cooperativity. Inhibition by dTTP and dUTP was measured over the same range of dCTP concentrations. They both inhibited the deamination reaction, but neither the Hill coefficient nor the maximal velocity was significantly affected, indicating simple competitive inhibition with apparent Ki values of 0.1 and 0.5 mm, respectively. The relatively high affinity for dTTP may be physiologically relevant for regulation of enzyme activity.Fig. 4Rate of dCTP deamination. The deamination was recorded at 282 nm (Assay 3), and the cuvette contained 1.0 μm enzyme in 500 μl of assay buffer. Evaluation indicated a maximal velocity of 0.41 s–1, half-saturation (S0.5) at 40 μm, and a Hill coefficient of 1.9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image"

The presence of the carbon-phosphorus bond renders phosphonate compounds highly resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis and appears to be a key determinant to the function of these molecules (1Hilderbrand R.L.

Freeman S. Seto H. Knowles J.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 457-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)). Phosphonopyruvate is subsequently converted into 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP or ciliatine), which is then incorporated into macromolecules such as phosphonolipids and proteoglycans (Fig. 1A). AEP was first identified as a minor component in acid hydrolysates of lipid and glycolipid extracts of the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (5Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the causative agent of Chagas' disease. Although dismissed as a minor component of lipopeptidophosphoglycan (now known as glycosylinositolphospholipid (GIPL)), subsequent studies indicate that AEP may be a universal component of the dense coat of glycoconjugates (mucins and GIPLs) that cover the surface of different stages of the parasite (6Carreira J.C.

Mucins are highly glycosylated proteins that are anchored in the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety. Although the lipid moiety of GPI anchors varies throughout the life cycle, most GPIs and GIPLs share a common Man4(AEP)GlcN-Ins-PO4 core (6Carreira J.C. Jones C. Wait R. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). AEP can also substitute for phosphoethanolamine in the linkage between the GPI anchor and the polypeptide chain of mucins, although this is not obligatory. In contrast, an additional AEP substituent on the O-6 of glucosamine of T. cruzi GPI anchors appears to be universal (6Carreira J.C. Jones C. Wait R. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and has also been identified in glycolipids from other members of the Kinetoplastida, including the dixenic bat trypanosome Trypanosoma dionisii (9Branquinha M.H.

However, the most abundant surface glycoconjugate of Leishmania (lipophosphoglycan, a GPI-anchored polymer of the repeating disaccharide phosphate units) does not contain AEP (12Turco S.J. Spath G.F. Beverley S.M. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 223-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Likewise, AEP is absent from the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei (5Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), where ethanolamine is an integral component of the variant surface glycoprotein (13Rifkin M.R. Strobos C.A.M. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol.

Here we report the isolation and functional expression of PEP mutase, some of its kinetic properties, and its subcellular localization in T. cruzi.

Routine manipulations were conducted in Escherichia coli strain JM109 and overexpression in strain BL21(DE3)pLysS (Stratagene). All chemicals were of the highest grade available from Sigma, BDH and Roche Applied Science. Phosphonopyruvate (tris-cyclohexylammonium salt) was prepared as described (16Freeman S. Irwin W.J. Schwalbe C.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1991; 2: 263-267Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Coutrot P. Savignac P. Mathey F. Synthesis. 1978; : 36-38Google Scholar). Cloning of PEP Mutase Gene from T. cruzi—A BLAST search of conserved sequence regions of PEP mutase from M. edulis and Tetrahymena pyriformis against the T. cruzi genome data base yielded a partial sequence (accession number AQ445225.2) with significant homology to other PEP mutases. This partial PEP mutase gene fragment was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GGGGTTCCGCGACACAACGAAGCG and 3′-CTGCATGGCGGCAATGCAGGCCC under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned into the Novagen vector ZEROBLUNT TOPO. The fluorescein-labeled PEP mutase PCR fragment was used as a probe in the initial isolation and characterization of this gene. A size-selected library (2–4 kilobases) was constructed in pUC18 with genomic DNA digested with HindIII and SacI. Positive clones were identified from a colony screen using the labeled probe and found to contain the same size insert. One of these was sequenced using primers designed to the known partial PEP mutase gene sequence, and the full-length gene was obtained. For expression studies the open reading frame of PEP mutase was amplified by PCR as described above using the primers PEPM-pET-15bF, GGCTCGAGATGCGTCACTGCTGTGGTCTG, and PEPM-pET-15bR, GGCTCGAGTTATTTCTTCGGCAAGTACATTTCC, engineered with XhoI sites in the 5′ and 3′ primers respectively, for cloning into the Invitrogen E. coli expression vector pET15b. Southern Blot Analysis—T. cruzi genomic DNA (5 μg) was digested with selected restriction endonucleases (BamHI, SacI, HindIII, and NdeI), separated by gel electrophoresis using a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization and signal detection were performed using the Gene Images labeling and detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Western Blot Analysis—Total extracts of T. cruzi and other trypanosomatids (1 × 106 parasites per lane) and M. edulis (5 μg) were fractionated by electrophoresis on 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE gels (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis was performed essentially as described (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar) using polyclonal antisera to PEP mutase and GAPDH at a dilution of 1:50. Blots were developed by chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's instructions (ECL kit, Amersham Biosciences). Soluble Expression of Recombinant PEP Mutase—A 6-liter culture of BL21(DE3)pLysS/pET15b-PepM, derived from a single colony, was grown at 37 °C with vigorous agitation in Terrific Broth containing 50 μg ml–1 carbenicillin and 12.5 μg ml–1 chloramphenicol. When the culture reached an A600 of ∼0.8, the culture was cooled to 25 °C, agitation was reduced to 100 rpm, and the culture was induced with a final concentration of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were grown for 16 h and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were washed with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and lysed in 50 ml of breaking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg ml–1 DNase I and protease inhibitor mixture, Roche Applied Science) by flash-freezing in an ethanol/dry ice bath followed by rapid thawing and bead beating. Cell debris was separated and discarded after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Purification and Properties of Recombinant PEP Mutase Protein— The supernatant containing soluble protein was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Bis-Tris propane, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl, passed through a 0.2-μm Steriflip filter, and loaded onto a nickel-chelating Sepharose high performance column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. Protein was eluted using a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m imidazole, and active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and digested with human thrombin (50 μg ml–1) for 2 h at 25 °C to remove the hexahistidine (His6) tag. The sample was then dialyzed for 2 h in 20 mm Bis-Tris propane, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and loaded onto a 6-ml ResourceQ column (Amersham Biosciences). Protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl, and the active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm (K+) Hepes, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.01% sodium azide. Aliquots of 50 μl were dispensed, rapidly frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Under these conditions the enzyme lost less than 10% of its activity over 4 months. Native Mr was determined by Superdex 200 column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) against gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). Molecular mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy in linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). Cross-linking experiments were conducted using the BS3 cross-linker (bis[sulfosuccinimidyl]suberate, Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. Kinetic Analysis of PEP Mutase—The pH optimum of the enzyme was determined over the pH range 5–10 using a mixed buffer system of 0.1 m CHES, 0.1 m MES, 0.1 m HEPPS. Enzyme activity was determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm and 25 °C in which ATP synthesis was coupled through pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to the oxidation of NADH. Each 1-ml assay contained 50 mm (K+) HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm ADP, 5 mm MgSO4, 16 units of pyruvate kinase, and 27 units of lactate dehydrogenase (both enzymes as solutions in 50% glycerol from Roche Applied Science), 88 nm T. cruzi PEP mutase, and 1 mm phosphonopyruvate. The Km for phosphonopyruvate was determined using this method by varying phosphonopyruvate concentration in the presence of 5mm MgSO4 or5mm magnesium acetate. Concentrations of phosphonopyruvate were standardized by spectrophotometric assay in the presence of excess PEP mutase. Protein concentration was determined based on the calculated extinction coefficient at 280 nm (34850 m–1 cm–1). This method yields a 1.5-fold higher protein concentration than that determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1μmol of NADH oxidized/min. Because Mg2+ is required for the coupled assay, the requirement for divalent metal ions was determined using a direct assay after the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate. Each 1-ml assay contained 50 mm (K+) HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 450 nm T. cruzi recombinant PEP mutase, 1 mm phosphonopyruvate, and varying amounts of MgSO4. The production of phosphoenolpyruvate was assayed by the increase in absorbance at 233 nm using a Δϵ = 1.5 mm–1cm–1 (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis to either the Michaelis-Menten equation (for phosphonopyruvate) or the Hill equation (for Mg2+) using the computer program GraFit. Sub-cellular Fractionation—The following procedures were performed at 4 °C. T. cruzi epimastigotes were centrifuged and washed twice in STE buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). Cells were mixed with silicon carbide to form a paste and disrupted by grinding with a pestle and mortar (21Toner J.J. Weber M.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1972; 46: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Grinding was continued until 90% of the cells were lysed as viewed by phase-contrast microscopy. The suspension was diluted 5–10-fold in STE buffer and briefly centrifuged for 3 min at 100 × g. The pellet was washed once in STE buffer and centrifuged. The combined supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The resultant supernatant was then centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet obtained contained the large granule fraction. The supernatant was spun for 1 h at 139,000 × g; the resulting supernatant contained the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was dissolved in STE buffer and contained the small granule or microsomal fraction. Production of T. cruzi PEP Mutase Antibody—Antiserum was raised in mice against recombinant T. cruzi PEP mutase (100 μg). The initial injection was emulsified in complete Freund adjuvant and the second in incomplete Freund adjuvant. Immunolocalization Studies—Mid-log phase epimastigotes were airdried onto microscope slides and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm potassium-phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature followed by methanol at –20 °C for 2 min. Slides were then incubated in PBS, 1% saponin, and 1 mg ml–1 heat-treated RNase for 30 min followed by blocking in 5% fetal calf serum, PBS for 5 min. The slides were then incubated in anti-T. cruzi PEP mutase diluted 1:50 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature in a dark humid chamber. After washing in PBS, slides were incubated for 1 h in fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted 1:50 in PBS. Slides were washed again, incubated in 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 μg ml–1) for 2 min followed by a further wash in PBS, and mounted in Mowiol containing phenylenediamine (1 μg ml–1). For double-labeling experiments using the anti-GAPDH (rabbit) and anti-PEP mutase (mouse), slides were treated as above except the primary antibody was a mixture of 1:100 and 1:50 dilution, respectively, of each antibody in PBS, and the secondary was a mixture of anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rabbit TRITC. Double-labeling experiments of monoclonal antibody to vacuolar type protein pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPiase) and anti-PEP mutase used Zenon™ One mouse IgG1 labeling kit (Molecular Probes) to label anti-V-H+-PPiase, as instructed by the manufacturers. After staining with the anti-V-H+-PPiase, slides were stained with anti-PEP mutase as above. Mitochondrial labeling of T. cruzi was conducted using MitoTracker Red 580 (Molecular Probes) as instructed by the manufacturers. Slides were double-labeled with anti-PEP mutase as described above. Cloning of the T. cruzi PEP Mutase Gene—A TBLASTN search of the EBI data base with the T. pyriformis protein sequence identified a T. cruzi genomic survey sequence (AQ445225.2) showing significant homology to PEP mutase. The partial sequence of the T. cruzi PEP mutase gene (PEPM) was amplified by PCR and used as a hybridization probe for a Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with a range of restriction enzymes. The resulting restriction map indicated that PEPM is single-copy per haploid genome (not shown). A size-selected library was constructed with genomic DNA digested with HindIII/SacI, and a 2.5-kb fragment was cloned and sequenced. This contained a single full-length open reading frame (GenBank™/EMBL/DDBJ accession number AJ414690) that showed significant homology to PEP mutase from other organisms (Fig. 2). The T. cruzi protein showed higher sequence identity to the eukaryotic proteins from M. edulis (65.4%) and T. pyriformis (62%) than those from prokaryotes Mesorhizobium loti (51.3%) and Streptomyces hygroscopicus (42.7%). Based on crystallographic data for the M. edulis PEP mutase (22Huang K. Li Z. Jia Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Herzberg O. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the active site amino acids are conserved in all species including T. cruzi PEP mutase (Trp-47, Ser-49, Asp-61, Asp-88, Asp-90, Glu-117, Lys-123, and Arg-163). The residues forming the oxyanion hole are also conserved in all the PEP mutase homologues (Gly-50 and Leu-51). Furthermore, the Mg2+ binding residue is Asp-88, which is also invariant among the PEP mutase homologues. Expression and Purification of Recombinant T. cruzi PEP Mutase—T. cruzi PEPM was sub-cloned into the expression vector pET15b containing an N-terminal His6 tag and expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein was purified on a nickel-chelating Sepharose high performance column, digested with thrombin to remove the His6 tag, and further purified by anionic exchange chromatography (Fig. 3A). The final yield of recombinant protein was ∼3 mg liter–1 of culture. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis of recombinant PEP mutase revealed a nominal molecular mass of 33,832 Da that correlates well with the predicted molecular mass of 33,482 Da after cleavage with thrombin. Migration on SDS-PAGE shows an Mr of ∼36,800 (Fig. 3A), similar to that reported for T. pyriformis (33,000) (4Seidel H.M. Freeman S. Seto H. Knowles J.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 457-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and M. edulis (34, 000) (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On gel filtration chromatography T. cruzi PEP mutase migrates as a single symmetrical peak corresponding to an Mr of 86,000 (n = 2.6, mean of 2 experiments), suggestive of either a homodimer (as reported for the T. pyriformis enzyme (23Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar)) or a novel trimeric species. To test this possibility the native enzyme was cross-linked with BS3 and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig 3C). The resulting gel indicates that the majority of the PEP mutase is recovered as a homotetramer with only trace amounts of trimer and dimer. Identical results were obtained when PEP mutase was held constant (1.5 mg ml–1) and cross-linker was varied (0.25–2.0 mM) over 0.5–4 h (data not shown). Crystallographic studies on the T. cruzi enzyme also reveal a tetrameric arrangement 2D. J. McNulty, M. Sarkar, A. H. Fairlamb, and D. M. F. van Aalten, unpublished results. as reported for the enzyme from M. edulis (22Huang K. Li Z. Jia Y. Dunaway-Mariano D. Herzberg O. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 539-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The reason for the anomalous behavior on gel filtration is not known. Kinetic Characterization of Recombinant PEP Mutase Protein—The pH profile for PEP mutase enzyme activity follows a bell-shaped curve with a pH optimum of 8 and apparent pKa values of 7.05 ± 0.09 and 9.12 ± 0.09 (data not shown). Under optimal conditions (pH 8.0, 1 mM phosphonopyruvate, 5 mM MgSO4) the specific activity of the purified recombinant T. cruzi enzyme (54 units mg–1) was similar to the enzymes from M. edulis (90 units mg–1 (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)) and T. pyriformis (22 units mg–1 (23Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) or 113 units mg–1, (24Seidel H.M. Pompliano D.L. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2598-2608Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Using the coupled assay, the enzyme followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with phosphonopyruvate (Fig. 4A), yielding an apparent Km value of 7.5 ± 0.6 μM, intermediate between 10 and 3.3 μM reported at pH 7.5 for T. pyriformis and M. edulis, respectively (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Seidel H.M. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A similar Km value (8.4 ± 1.1 μM) was obtained with 5 mM magnesium acetate replacing 5 mM MgSO4 (not shown). The kcat values for the T. cruzi enzyme (12.4 ± 0.2 s–1 with MgSO4; 11 ± 0.3 s–1 with magnesium acetate) was somewhat lower than those for T. pyriformis (150 s–1) and M. edulis (34 s–1). The requirement for divalent metal ions (1 mm, all as chloride salts) was determined by measuring the thermodynamically favored direction of the reaction, i.e. formation of phosphoenolpyruvate at 233 nm. The enzyme displayed a pronounced requirement for divalent metal ions with <1% activity in the absence of Mg2+. The extent of activation was identical to that reported for the M. edulis enzyme (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the order being Mg2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+ > Zn2+ > Ni2+, with Ca2+ showing no activation (not shown). Sulfate and other oxyanions have been reported to be inhibitory with the T. pyriformis enzyme (25Seidel H.M. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, with the T. cruzi PEP mutase – is not inhibitory when compared with Cl– anion. In kinetic studies where MgSO4 was the variable substrate, double-reciprocal plots were nonlinear (not shown). However, the data fitted well to the Hill equation yielding an S0.5 of 0.40 ± 0.04 μM, n = 0.46 ± 0.03, kcat 19 ± 0.4 s–1, consistent with a negative co-operative effect between subunits (Fig. 4B). Co-operative behavior has not been reported with Mg2+ for PEP mutase from M. edulis (Km 4 μM) (20Kim A. Kim J. Martin B.M. Dunaway-Mariano D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4443-4448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or T. pyriformis (Km 6 μM) (23Bowman E.D. McQueney M.S. Scholten J.D. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7059-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Species Distribution and Intracellular Location—Western analysis using antibodies raised against the T. cruzi recombinant protein indicated that PEP mutase is constitutively expressed in the insect epimastigote, trypomastigote, and mammalian amastigote stages of the life cycle (data not shown). The antiserum also detects a 34-kDa band in M. edulis extracts but not in more closely related trypanosomatid species, suggesting that PEP mutase is absent in T. brucei, Crithidia fasciculata, Leishmania major, and Leishmania donovani (Fig. 5A). Two other trypanosomatids, T. dionisii and Herpetomonas muscarum, which contain AEP glycolipids, also show a band corresponding to T. cruzi PEP mutase (Fig. 5A). Subcellular fractionation studies and immunolabeling experiments indicate that PEP mutase has a dual location in the cell. Western blots of subcellular fractions show that the enzyme is present in the cytosol and large granule fraction, which is enriched in mitochondria, glycosomes, and other large vesicular organelles (Fig. 5B). This dual location is unlikely to be a preparative artifact since antiserum to T. cruzi trypanothione synthetase (26Oza S.L. Tetaud E. Ariyanayagam M.R. Warnon S.S. Fairlamb A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35853-35861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed a largely cytosolic location. Immunofluorescence staining shows a diffuse cytosolic staining together with a punctate pattern in the cells (Fig. 6). This distribution is reminiscent of glycosomal staining even though the amino acid sequence does not show a type I or type II glycosomal targeting signal (27Parsons M. Furuya T. Pal S. Kessler P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 115: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Staining with anti-serum to glycosomal GAPDH is also punctate, but examination of the merged image indicates that anti-PEP mutase does not co-localize exactly with the glycosome (Fig. 6A). Double-labeling with anti-PEP mutase antibody and Mitotraker indicates that PEP mutase is not located to the mitochondrion either (Fig. 6B). The presence of glycoconjugates in acidocalcisomes has been reported recently (30Salto M.L. Kuhlenschmidt T. Kuhlenschmidt M. Lederkremer R. Docampo R. Molecular Parasitology Meeting XII, September 22–26, Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA. 2002; (Abst. 234)Google Scholar). However, double labeling of slides with anti-PEP mutase and anti-H+-PPiase, an acidocalcisome marker, clearly do not co-localize (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that PEP mutase is not specifically localized to the glycosome, mitochondria, or acidocalcisome, but to some other unidentified organelle. Although AEP was first identified in T. cruzi by 32P-labeling studies (5Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the biosynthetic pathway has not been investigated in detail. Our current study has identified a functional PEP mutase in T. cruzi, which is expressed in all stages of the life cycle. The kinetic properties closely resemble those of M. edulis and T. pyriformis, suggesting that the biosynthetic pathway is similar to other microorganisms (Fig. 1). Attempts to identify candidate genes for the subsequent step in the pathway (phosphonopyruvate decarboxylase) in the partially completed T. cruzi genome data base proved negative. Pyruvate phosphate dikinase, which could catalyze formation of PEP from pyruvate, has been localized to the glycosome (28Bringaud F. Baltz D. Baltz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7963-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but PEP mutase does not perfectly co-localize with this organelle. Furthermore, pyruvate phosphate dikinase must serve additional roles in T. brucei since AEP and PEP mutase appear to be absent from this parasite (5Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to resolve the unusual subcellular localization of this enzyme. Phosphonolipids constitute 23% of total phospholipids in T. pyriformis, and it has been proposed that surface phosphonolipids are important for protection against phospholipases secreted by itself or by other organisms (29Florin-Christensen J. Florin-Christensen M. Knudsen J. Rasmussen L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 354-355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, this is unlikely to be the case for T. cruzi since phosphonolipids constitute a minor fraction (0.34%) of total phospholipids (5Ferguson M.A.J. Allen A.K. Snary D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of PEP mutase in trypanosomatids correlates exactly with those parasites that have been reported to possess AEP glycolipids, and thus, one function of the pathway could be to supply AEP for glycolipid synthesis. Although AEP and ethanolamine phosphate can be used interchangeably to link the GPI anchor to the polypeptide chain of mucins, the glucosamine moiety is exclusively substituted by AEP (6Carreira J.C. Jones C. Wait R. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, the universality of AEP modification of the 6-O position of glucosamine in GIPLs and mucins suggests an essential role for this moiety in these surface glycoconjugates. Because they are thought to play a role in attachment, invasion, and intracellular survival in the parasite, the AEP moiety may be an important determinant in one or more of these functions. Likewise, GPI anchors from T. cruzi, which show pronounced proinflammatory activity, play an important role in activation of innate immunity during infection (7Almeida I.C. Gazzinelli R.T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 467-477PubMed Google Scholar, 8Acosta-Serrano A. Almeida I.C. Freitas L.H. Yoshida N. Schenkman S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conceivably, the AEP substituent could protect these molecules from degradation in the gut of the insect vector or the cytoplasm of vertebrate host cells. Gene knockout studies are planned to examine these possibilities and to evaluate whether this pathway could represent a therapeutic target since it is absent in the mammalian host. We acknowledge the T. cruzi genome project for access to partial sequence data. We thank Fred Opperdoes for antibodies to T. cruzi GAPDH, Roberto Docampo for useful suggestions and for supplying an antibody marker for the acidocalcisome, Alan Prescott for assistance with microscopy, Sandra Oza for antiserum to trypanothione synthetase, and Ahilan Saravanamuthu for generating mouse polyclonal antiserum to PEP mutase."
https://openalex.org/W2016505516,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) is essential for integration of viral DNA into host cell chromatin. We have reported previously (Priet, S., Navarro, J. M., Gros, N., Querat, G., and Sire, J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 4566–4571) that IN also plays a role in the packaging of the host uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 into viral particles and that the region of IN encompassing residues 170–180 was responsible for the interaction with UNG2 and for its packaging into virions. In this work, we aimed to investigate the replication of HIV-1 viruses rendered deficient in virion-associated UNG2 by single or double point mutations in the region 170–180 of IN. We show that the L172A/K173A IN mutant virus was deficient for UNG2 packaging and was defective for replication because of a blockage at the stage of proviral DNA integration in host cell DNA. In vitro assays using long term repeat mimics, however, demonstrate that the L172A/K173A IN mutant was catalytically active. Moreover, trans-complementation experiments show that the viral propagation of L172A/K173A viruses could be rescued by the overexpression of Vpr·L172A/K173A IN fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner and that this rescue is independent of UNG2 packaging. Altogether, our data indicate that L172A/K173A mutations of IN induce a subtle defect in the function of IN, which nevertheless dramatically impairs viral replication. Unexpectedly, this blockage of replication could be overcome by forcing the packaging of higher amounts of this same mutated integrase. This is the first study reporting that blockage of the integration process of HIV-1 provirus carrying a mutation of IN could be alleviated by increasing amounts of IN even carrying the same mutations. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) integrase (IN) is essential for integration of viral DNA into host cell chromatin. We have reported previously (Priet, S., Navarro, J. M., Gros, N., Querat, G., and Sire, J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 4566–4571) that IN also plays a role in the packaging of the host uracil DNA glycosylase UNG2 into viral particles and that the region of IN encompassing residues 170–180 was responsible for the interaction with UNG2 and for its packaging into virions. In this work, we aimed to investigate the replication of HIV-1 viruses rendered deficient in virion-associated UNG2 by single or double point mutations in the region 170–180 of IN. We show that the L172A/K173A IN mutant virus was deficient for UNG2 packaging and was defective for replication because of a blockage at the stage of proviral DNA integration in host cell DNA. In vitro assays using long term repeat mimics, however, demonstrate that the L172A/K173A IN mutant was catalytically active. Moreover, trans-complementation experiments show that the viral propagation of L172A/K173A viruses could be rescued by the overexpression of Vpr·L172A/K173A IN fusion protein in a dose-dependent manner and that this rescue is independent of UNG2 packaging. Altogether, our data indicate that L172A/K173A mutations of IN induce a subtle defect in the function of IN, which nevertheless dramatically impairs viral replication. Unexpectedly, this blockage of replication could be overcome by forcing the packaging of higher amounts of this same mutated integrase. This is the first study reporting that blockage of the integration process of HIV-1 provirus carrying a mutation of IN could be alleviated by increasing amounts of IN even carrying the same mutations. HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; IN, integrase; ΔIN, IN minus; CA, capsid; LTR, long terminal repeat; UNG2, uracil DNA glycosylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TCID50, 50% tissue culture infective dose. integrase (IN) is an essential component required for the persistence of infection in vivo. IN is incorporated into viral particles as a part of the Gag-Pol precursor polyprotein that contains Gag (matrix, capsid (CA), nucleocapsid NCp7, and p6) and Pol (protease, reverse transcriptase, and IN) domains. Each of these domains is expressed individually upon proteolytic processing of the precursor by the viral protease. The functional role of IN is to catalyze the integration of the viral genome into the cellular genome through a two-step process that includes processing of the viral LTR ends and integration (reviewed by Ref. 1Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The processing step removes the terminal TG dinucleotide at each 3′-end of the proviral genome generating recessed 3′-ends. The integration step allows the nucleophilic attack of the host DNA by the recessed 3′-OH group in a trans-esterification reaction. Mutational analysis of IN identified distinct functional domains within the protein. The N-terminal domain (residues 1 to 50) contains a highly conserved HHCC motif that binds zinc (2Zheng, R., Jenkins, T. M., and Craigie, R. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genetic studies have indicated that mutations in IN affect multiple and distinct steps in the replication cycle, including protein maturation, virion morphology, uncoating, reverse transcription, and integration per se, revealing multiple consequences of altered IN in the viral life cycle (15Engelman A. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 411-426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although in vitro studies have demonstrated that IN alone is sufficient to promote the integration process (1Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23213-23216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), lines of evidence indicate that other viral and cellular proteins can regulate this process. For example, it has been reported that NCp7 might influence the coupled joining by promoting DNA distortion (16Carteau S. Gorelick R.J. Bushman F.D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6670-6679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that reverse transcriptase might play a role in blocking the auto-integration process (17Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Host proteins, upon association with IN, have also been reported to improve in vitro viral DNA integration. The barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) acts as an inhibitor to the undesirable autointegration process (18Harris D. Engelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39671-39677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the HMGI(Y) protein stimulates concerted viral DNA integration (19Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 483-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). DNA-dependent protein kinase has been reported to be involved in the completion of the integration process (20Daniel R. Katz R.A. Skalka A.M. Science. 1999; 284: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In some cases host proteins, such as the integrase inhibitor 1 (Ini1) factor or the uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG2) enzyme, interact with IN and are specifically incorporated into viral particles (21Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 22Willetts K.E. Rey F. Agostini I. Navarro J.M. Baudat Y. Vigne R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1682-1688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that leucine residue 172 of IN was important for the packaging of the host UNG2 enzyme (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We have shown that virion-associated UNG2 plays a role similar to its cellular counterpart and participates in the correction of G:U mispairs to G:C pairs. The present study was designed to investigate whether the presence of UNG2 inside viral particles was required for efficient viral replication. We used a series of viruses mutated for each of the residues encompassing the region 170–181 of the α5 helix of IN, which is located outside of the catalytic triad of aspartic acid and glutamic acid residues, the D, D(35)E sequence motif. This series of mutations enabled us to classify viruses as deficient or proficient for UNG2 packaging (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results show the following. i) Viruses with IN mutated at residues 172/173, 174, 178, and 180/181 are impaired for replication. ii) The failure to replicate of viruses with mutations at residues 174, 178, and 180/181, but not of those with mutations at residues 172/173, correlates with a loss of the in vitro catalytic activity of IN. iii) Although IN with mutation at residues 172/173 still retains its enzymatic activity, the integration process of L172A/K173A viruses is abrogated in the context of infection. iv) Finally, overexpression in trans of VPR·L172A/K173A IN fusion protein rescues, in a dose-dependent manner, the replication of L172A/K173A viruses, indicating that the defect of cis IN mutated viruses was compensated by increasing amounts of mutated IN. Altogether, our data point out the importance of leucine residue 172 in the viral integration process and UNG2 packaging. Plasmid Construction—The construction of IN mutated viruses has been described previously (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). DNA fragments each containing IN mutations were also PCR amplified and cloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of pGEX 5X2 (Amersham Biosciences) in order to generate plasmids expressing GST·IN fusion proteins. For trans-complementation experiments, the pLR2P-Vpr-IN expression vector kindly provided by J. Kappes (24Liu H. Wu X. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7704-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Each of the IN mutations was introduced into this plasmid by PCR procedures in order to generate pLR2P-Vpr-IN mutants. The entire sequence of each mutated IN was checked by DNA sequencing. In the pLR2P-Vpr-IN vector, the Vpr gene was also mutated (W54G) to prevent any interaction between Vpr and UNG2, and the vector was used to construct Vpr(W54G)-IN(L172A/K173A) double mutant fusion. As a control, a Vpr-only expression vector was constructed by introducing a stop codon at the end of the Vpr reading frame in the pLR2P-Vpr-IN vector. Cell Lines, Transfection, and Infection—Human 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. The SupT1, H9, and C8166 cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. Viral stocks were produced by transfection of each of the proviral DNAs into subconfluent 293T cells with the FuGENE 6 transfectant reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For viral replication studies, SupT1 cells were infected with viral stocks obtained from the cell-free supernatant of transfected 293T cells and calibrated for equivalent amounts of CA p24 antigen by HIV-1 p24 antigen capture assay kit (Coulter). Propagation of viral infection was followed by measuring the reverse transcriptase activity in cell-free supernatants twice a week. For trans-complementation studies, provirus expression plasmids were cotransfected in 293T cells at a ratio of 2:1 with pLR2P-Vpr-IN expression vectors. Viral supernatants were then calibrated for similar amounts of CA p24 antigen by an HIV-1 p24 antigen capture assay kit. Serial 5-fold dilutions were used to infect the C8166 indicator cell line. The infectivity of trans-complemented viruses was calculated by the Reed-Muench method (25Burleson D.G. Johnson A. Salin M. Mason Jr., A.D. Pruitt Jr., B.A. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1992; 199: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) to determine the 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). Expression of Vpr·IN fusion proteins in trans-complemented viruses was analyzed by Western blot with rabbit polyclonal anti-IN antibody (a gift from D. Trono). Similar amounts of trans-complemented viruses were used as judged by the level of CA p24 antigen in the viral lysate revealed by Western blot with sheep polyclonal anti-p24 antibody (Aalto Bio Reagents, Rathfarnham-Dublin, Ireland). The presence of UNG2 was revealed by Western blot using anti-UNG2 antibody kindly provided by G. Slupphaug. Purification of Viruses—Viral particles released in the cell-free supernatant of transfected cells were collected by ultracentrifugation and highly purified through 8–18% Optiprep density gradient as described (26Dettenhofer M. Yu X.F. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1460-1467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient fractions coinciding with the peak of the reverse transcriptase activity were pooled and normalized for equivalent amounts of the CA p24 antigen. Viral lysate was obtained by lysis of purified virions in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) in the presence of 0.2% of Triton X-100. In Vitro Catalytic Activity of IN—GST·IN fusion proteins were expressed in Epicurian Coli BL21-codonPlus RIL (Stratagene) and purified on glutathione-agarose beads as reported previously (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST derivatives were eluted from agarose beads in the presence of 20 mm glutathione, and the purity of proteins was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. The amounts of GST derivatives were quantified by comparison with the bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard. The oligonucleotide pair used for processing activity measurement was 71 (5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′) and 72 (5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTGCACAC-3′). The oligonucleotide pair used for strand transfer activity measurement was 70 (5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3′) and 72. Oligonucleotides 70 and 71 were 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and purified through Microspin G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences) before annealing to oligonucleotide 72. IN catalytic activity was assayed essentially as described (27Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 nm of each GST derivative were incubated with 10 nm of the appropriate set of oligonucleotides in a final volume of 20 μl of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MnCl2. After an incubation of 1 h at 37 °C, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, and DNA products were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 10 μg of tRNA carrier. DNA products of the 3′-processing and DNA strand transfer reactions were dried and dissolved in 10 μl of 95% formamide loading dye. The samples were separated on 8 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide denaturating gels in 1× TBE. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, and radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. Where indicated, increasing amounts (5, 25, and 100 nm)ofGST·wild-type IN and GST·L172A/K173A IN were used in the assay. Determination of Viral DNA Integration—Viral stocks from transfected 293T cells were filtered through 0.45-μm pore size filters and treated with DNase I (20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. H9 cells (106) were infected for 2 h by spinoculation (28O'Doherty U. Swiggard W.J. Malim M.H. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10074-10080Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) with equal amounts of IN mutant viruses; then cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured for 18 additional hours. The total DNA was isolated from the infected cells by the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit protocol (Qiagen) and eluted with 200 μl of elution buffer. Viral DNA products corresponding to the different steps of retrotranscription were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR as described in literature (29Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR was performed with an ABI PRISM 7000 apparatus (Applied Biosystems) using PCR primers and TaqMan probes described previously (29Butler S.L. Hansen M.S. Bushman F.D. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 631-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The integrated forms of proviral DNA were assessed using a two-step PCR amplification with 5′ Alu primer (5′-TCCCAGCTACTGGGGAGGCTGAGG-3′) and L1 primer (5′-AGGCAAGCTTTATTGAGGCTTAGGC-3′) followed by nested PCR with L2 primer (5′-CTGTGGATCTACCACACACAAGGCTAC-3′) and L3 primer (5′-GCTGCTTATATGTAGCATCTGAGGGC-3′) as described (30Wu Y. Marsh J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Propagation of IN Mutant Viruses in Infected Cell Culture—In a previous report (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) we showed that residues encompassing the region 170–181 of IN were critical for host UNG2 packaging. We performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and delineated the residues responsible for UNG2 packaging (Fig. 1). In this study we investigated the replication of UNG2-deficient or UNG2-proficient viruses. Each of the IN mutated viruses was examined for replication in infected cells. Viral stocks were produced from 293T cells transfected with each IN mutant proviral DNA. Transfected cells yielded mutated viruses at a level corresponding to 80–100% of the wild-type level, suggesting that mutations in IN did not seem to affect virion assembly and release (data not shown). Similar amounts of viruses, as estimated by CA p24 antigen measurement, were used to infect Sup T1 cells, and propagation of infection was monitored by measuring the reverse transcriptase activity in the cell-free supernatant of infected cells twice a week. As shown in Fig. 2, viruses carrying mutations at residues 170/171 or 176/177 displayed wild-type kinetics of replication. In contrast, viruses with mutations 172/173, 174, 178, or 180/181 did not replicate at all. This complete failure to replicate is reminiscent of viruses with a defect at the integration stage of the proviral genome and suggests that the catalytic properties of mutated IN could be altered.Fig. 2Replication kinetics of wild-type and IN mutant viruses. Viruses produced in the cell-free supernatant of 293T cells transfected with each of proviral DNAs were harvested, calibrated for similar amounts of CA p24 antigen, and used to infect Sup T1 cells. Virus production was monitored by measuring the reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in the cell-free supernatant twice a week.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Catalytic Activity of IN Mutants—We therefore investigated whether disrupting some residues of the region 170–181 of IN affects its catalytic function. We measured processing and integration steps by using in vitro assays with similar amounts of purified GST·IN proteins. For these assays, IN mutant proteins fused in N terminus to GST were purified from bacterial lysate and incubated with appropriate oligonucleotides. The presence of faster migrating DNA species is the hallmark of the processing process (Fig. 3, top panel), and the presence of slower-migrating DNA species is the hallmark of the integration process (Fig. 3, bottom panel). As a negative control, we used the GST·IN protein with a missense mutation (D116A) in the catalytic core domain of IN, impairing the integration process (6Engelman A. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6361-6369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results showed that IN proteins with mutations at residues 170/171, 172/173, and 176/177 behaved as wild-type (Fig. 3). In contrast, IN with mutations at residues 174, 178, or 180/181 was enzymatically inactive, explaining why viruses carrying these mutations failed to replicate. Intriguingly, the L172A/K173A IN protein exhibited wild-type catalytic activity, although this mutation in the context of HIV-1 virus infection was shown to impair replication. A provirus bearing the single point mutation L172A was constructed, and results of the infectivity study showed that residue L172A alone was responsible for both UNG2 packaging (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and the defect of replication (not shown). Impaired Integration Process of L172A/K173A Viruses—We next examined which step(s) of the viral life cycle, including reverse transcription, nuclear import, and integration processes, was altered in cells infected with L172A/K173A viruses. H9 cells were infected with similar amounts of viruses from the DNase I-treated cell-free supernatant of transfected cells, and, 18 h post-infection, viral DNA from wild-type or IN mutated viruses produced during the unique cycle of infection was extracted and amplified with appropriate primer pairs. Using real-time PCR to quantify the amounts of reverse transcription intermediate DNA products (R-U5, R-Gag, and 2-LTR circles), we detected similar amounts of completed products of reverse transcription in cells infected with either wild-type, D116A, or L172A/K173A viruses (data not shown), indicating that viral DNA synthesis and nuclear entry were unaffected. We then measured the integration process by evaluating proviral integration events using an Alu LTR PCR assay with primers corresponding to the viral LTR and the repetitive Alu sequences present in the cellular DNA. Results in Fig. 4 show the complete absence of integrated DNA products for D116A and L172A/K173A viruses in contrast to wild-type viruses, indicating that the L172A/K173A virus was defective at the integration step, although its integrase was demonstrated to be functional in the LTR mimic assays in vitro. Rescue of the Replication of L172A/K173A Viruses—To address whether replication of L172A/K173A viruses could be restored, we used a previously reported experimental system (24Liu H. Wu X. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7704-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Fletcher III, T.M. Soares M.A. McPhearson S. Hui H. Wiskerchen M. Muesing M.A. Shaw G.M. Leavitt A.D. Boeke J.D. Hahn B.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5123-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Liu H. Wu X. Xiao H. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8831-8836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Kim J. Seshaiah P. Natsoulis G. Boeke J.D. Hahn B.H. Kappes J.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wu X. Liu H. Xiao H. Conway J.A. Hunter E. Kappes J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5113-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in which IN protein was incorporated in trans into viral particles via a fusion with HIV-1 Vpr (Fig. 5A). It has been reported that proviruses mutated in one domain of IN can be rescued by trans-expressed IN containing mutations in another domain (14van Gent D.C. Vink C. Groeneger A.A. Plasterk R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This successful trans-complementation was indeed due to the ability of INs to oligomerize each subunit, providing distinct functions to obtain a wild-type IN phenotype. Viral stocks were generated by cotransfection of D116A, IN minus (ΔIN), or L172A/K173A proviral DNA together with expression vectors encoding VPR·wild-type IN, VPR·L172A/K173A IN, or VPR·D116A IN fusion proteins. The C8166 indicator cell line was infected with serial 5-fold dilutions of viral stocks. The infectivity of trans-complemented viruses was measured by the number of cell-forming syncytia and expressed as the TCID50. Expression of Vpr·IN fusion proteins in trans-complemented viral particles was demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig. 5B). The apparently higher levels of IN in trans-complemented viruses, compared with non-trans-complemented viruses, is likely due to proteolytic cleavage of the Vpr·IN protein by the viral protease. As expected, the trans-expression of wild-type IN rescued the replication of the ΔIN, L172A/K173A, and D116A viruses (Fig. 5C). The trans-expression of D116A IN, which is catalytically incompetent, restored the replication of L172A/K173A viruses but not that of ΔIN and D116A viruses. Conversely, trans-expression of L172A/K173A IN has the capacity to rescue the replication of D116A and ΔIN viruses up to ∼50% of that shown with trans wild-type IN. Unexpectedly, trans-complementation experiments showed that trans L172A/K173A IN can rescue the propagation of L172A/K173A viruses, although both cis- and trans-expressed IN proteins carried the same mutation. This restoration is approximately twice less efficient than that observed with trans wild-type IN, whatever the cis-expressed viruses. Altogether, these results suggest that mutations of residues 172 and 173 of IN fused to Vpr did not alter the catalytic property of IN. The Rescue of Replication Is Independent of UNG2 Packaging—Previous studies have reported that Vpr associates with UNG2 (35Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.M. Agostini I. Spire B. Camonis J. Slupphaug G. Vigne R. Benarous R. Sire J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 697-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that Vpr can promote the packaging of overexpressed HA-tagged UNG2 into viral particles (36Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the rescue of L172A/K173A viruses might be due to the packaging of host UNG2 via the Vpr portion within the Vpr·IN fusion protein, we analyzed the presence of packaged UNG2 into highly purified ΔIN viruses trans-complemented with either Vpr·IN or VPR·L172A/K173A IN. Results presented in Fig. 6 show that ΔIN virus was devoid of detectable endogenous UNG2 and that neither Vpr fusions with wild-type IN nor those with mutated IN were able to direct a substantial packaging of UNG2. As a control, similar amounts of the HIV-1 wild-type virus were analyzed and showed the presence of packaged UNG2. These data indicate that IN promoted UNG2 packaging in the context of the Gag-Pol polyprotein but not in the context of a Vpr·IN fusion. To ascertain that no UNG2 packaging was responsible for the rescue, we performed trans-complementation assays with a Vpr·IN fusion protein, containing Vpr mutated at tryptophan 54, fused to L172A/K173A IN. The W54R and W54G mutations have been shown to abolish the interaction with UNG2 (36Mansky L.M. Preveral S. Selig L. Benarous R. Benichou S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7039-7047Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 2S. Priet, J.-M. Navarro, G. Quérat, and J. Sire, unpublished data. Our results indicate that the W54G·VPR·L172A/K173A IN fusion protein rescued the viral propagation of L172A/K173A viruses to the same extent as the wild-type VPR·L172A/K173A IN fusion protein, demonstrating that the Vpr-UNG2 association was not involved in the successful rescue of L172A/K173A viruses (data not shown). Trans-complementation of cis L172A/K173A Viruses by trans L172A/K173A IN Is Dose-dependent—To understand how the overexpression of L172A/K173A IN can rescue the propagation of L172A/K173A viruses, we carried out trans-complementation experiments with increasing amounts of wild-type and L172A/K173A IN fusion proteins. The expression level of fused proteins in both cell lysate and viral particles was analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 7A). Trans-complementation of L172A/K173A viruses with increased doses of trans wild-type or L172A/K173A IN proteins led to a dose-dependent rescue of viral propagation (Fig. 7B). These data indicate that the failure to replicate of L172A/K173A viruses could be compensated by increasing amounts of trans L172A/K173A IN protein delivered into viral particles. To demonstrate that IN alone, and not IN-associated proteins, was involved in the rescue of L172A/K173A viruses, we performed in vitro experiments wherein the catalytic activity of increasing amounts of recombinant L172A/K173A IN was compared with that of wild-type IN. As shown in Fig. 8, both the processing and DNA strand transfer of L172A/K173A IN fusion protein, although this latter was catalytically active, were nevertheless ∼4 times less efficient than those of wild-type IN. These in vitro results are consistent with in vivo results showing that trans L172A/K173A IN in infected cells rescues the replication of cis L172A/K173A viruses in a dosedependent manner. In a previous report (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we analyzed a series of HIV-1 viruses with point mutations in the 170–181 region of IN to determine which residues of IN were important for host UNG2 packaging. We demonstrated that leucine residue 172, and not adjacent residues, was required for the incorporation of UNG2 into viral particles. In this study, we have investigated the replicative properties of HIV-1 viruses deficient or proficient for the presence of UNG2 in viral particles. We showed that UNG2-proficient viruses (E170A/H171A and V176A/Q177A viruses) replicated as wild-type viruses, except those whose mutations induced severe alterations of the catalytic activity of IN (T174A, M178A, and V180A/F181A viruses). In contrast, the UNG2-deficient virus (L172A/K173A IN mutant virus) failed to replicate and was impaired at the stage of integration of proviral DNA into host cell chromatin. In trans-complementation assays, proviruses mutated in one domain of IN can be rescued by trans-expressed IN containing a mutation in another domain (14van Gent D.C. Vink C. Groeneger A.A. Plasterk R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). This trans-complementation was due to the ability of INs to oligomerize, each subunit providing distinct functions to obtain a wild-type IN phenotype. The replication defect of viruses carrying the L172A/K173A IN mutation can be rescued by the coexpression in trans of the catalytically incompetent D116A IN protein, indicating that the two mutated IN proteins retain their ability to oligomerize and that the defect of the L172A/K173A IN viruses was compensated by the presence of the wild-type leucine 172 residue in D116A. Therefore, the replication blockage of L172A/K173A viruses was not due to alteration of the catalytic properties of the mutated IN per se. Remarkably, these L172A/K173A viruses were also rescued by dose-dependent trans-expression of the same mutated IN. These data correlate well with the integration assays using LTR mimics in vitro, which show that four times more L172A/K173A IN than wild-type IN was required to achieve a similar integration pattern. Because the first step of the integration reaction, namely the processing of the 3′-ends of the LTR mimics, is affected, we propose that mutated IN is less efficient in binding to the LTR ends. This weakness in LTR binding was alleviated by allowing a higher concentration of mutated IN. We propose that the integration process is a rate-limiting process in the natural course of HIV-1 infection. It is possible that the integration activity of viruses with the L172A/K173A IN mutation is just below the threshold. A slight enhancement of the expression of IN in infected cells, even carrying the same mutation, might surpass the threshold and lead to the restoration of the integration process. In trans-complementation assays, we observed that host UNG2 could not be packaged by the Vpr·IN fusion despite being clearly dependent on the presence of IN in the context of the Gag-Pol precursor. We can speculate on two hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive. First, the folding of IN processed from the Vpr fusion protein may not accurately reflect the folding of IN processed from the Gag-Pol precursor, leading to differential bindings of UNG2. Such a differential in binding between INs deriving from either the Vpr·IN fusion or the Gag-Pol precursor has been reported in the case of the HA-S6 trans dominant mutant of the integrase interactor 1 (Ini 1) (21Yung E. Sorin M. Pal A. Craig E. Morozov A. Delattre O. Kappes J. Ott D. Kalpana G.V. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Second, although the IN domain of the Gag-Pol precursor is required for UNG2 packaging, it may not be sufficient. Indeed, we have reported previously that UNG2 can also bind viral reverse transcriptase (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It may be that a triple interaction between UNG2 and both the reverse transcriptase and IN domains of the Gag-Pol precursor is necessary to allow the efficient packaging of UNG2. Because the L172A/K173A mutation led to a severe blockage in provirus integration in vivo, we were unable to follow the replication of the sole UNG2-deficient virus over many replicative cycles. The integration defect could be rescued in trans by overexpression of IN, either wild-type or mutated, but it allowed only one replicative cycle. However, we have previously reported (23Priet S. Navarro J.M. Gros N. Querat G. Sire J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4566-4571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that wild-type but not UNG2-deficient viruses have the ability to repair G:U mispairs, suggesting a role of UNG2 in the control of the accuracy of reverse transcription. If the rescued proviral DNA is riddled with G to A mutations due to unprocessed uracils in the absence of packaged UNG2, that would lead to impair replication in subsequent passages of the virus. The role of the virion-associated UNG2 enzyme in the viral life cycle remains an open question and will require studies of viral replication in UNG2-deficient T cells. In conclusion, we have investigated the replicative properties of UNG2-deficient or -proficient IN mutant viruses in order to study the role of packaged UNG2 in the viral life cycle. We have not been able to draw definite conclusions about the importance of UNG2 for HIV-1 replication, but we have found an interesting mutant of IN that could be rescued by allowing a higher concentration of the very same mutant integrase in the viral particle. Whether the mutation L172A/K173K leads to a reduced affinity of IN for its LTR substrate or to another undefined defect remains to be investigated. We thank R.

We estimated the real-time kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction of g5p with thioredoxin (wild type and mutants) using surface plasmon resonance. Thioredoxin was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip through a six-carbon spacer (6-amino-n-hexanoic acid) using standard amine coupling. Reduced thioredoxin bound g5p but oxidized thioredoxin did not.

The strong binding of g5p to thioredoxin is therefore due to fast association and very slow dissociation, a situation similar to antigen-antibody interactions. Thioredoxin mutants P34S, D26A, K57M, D26A/K57M, W31F, W31Y, K36A, K36E, and Y49F had KD values in the range of 1 to 8 nm, whereas mutant W28A had a KD of 12.5 nm. No detectable interaction was observed for mutants P40G, W31H, W31A, and C35A. The effect of temperature on KD and the changes in enthalpy (–ΔH = 20.2 kcal·m–1) and entropy (TΔS =–8.4 kcal·m–1) upon formation of the complex suggested that the interaction is driven by an increase in enthalpy and opposed by a decrease in entropy.

(80 kDa) and thioredoxin (12 kDa) from the Escherichia coli host (1Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 74: 780-784Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar). g5p is a potent 3′ to 5′ single-strand DNA exonuclease and a weak 3′ to 5′ exonuclease for double-stranded DNA. Its DNA polymerase activity is low, g5p incorporating about 15 nucleotides to the primer-template before leaving it (2Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon complex formation with thioredoxin, the affinity of g5p to primer-template increases at least 80-fold, and g5p becomes a potent polymerase (3Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity is retained, and an additional potent 3′-5′ exonuclease activity for double-stranded DNA is acquired. E. coli thioredoxin catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions via two redox-active vicinal thiols (C32GPC35). The enzyme can thus be in an oxidized (Trx-S2) or reduced (Trx-(SH)2) state. Trx-(SH)2 can reduce exposed disulfides in many proteins, among others ribonucleotide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, and 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase (4Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecule has a central core formed by three parallel and two anti-parallel strands of pleated β sheets, which are surrounded by four α helices (thioredoxin fold) (4Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active site thiols of thioredoxin are located on a protruding turn between β2 and α2 consisting of residues 29–37. Loop residues glycine 33, 75–76, and 91–93 are adjacent to the active site with which they form a flat hydrophobic surface believed to be involved in interactions with other proteins (5Holmgren A.

LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Solution structures of Trx-S2 and Trx-(SH)2 are similar with most differences occurring in the conformation in and around the active site (8Jeng M.-F. Campbell A.P. Begly T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The gene of thioredoxin (trxA) is not essential for E. coli, however, its presence is mandatory for the growth of phages M13, f1, and T7 (9Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 4: 271-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of phage T7, thioredoxin is essential for the DNA replication of the phage (1Mark D.F. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 74: 780-784Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Chamberlin M. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase complexed with primer-template revealed that thioredoxin binds to an extended mobile 71-residue loop located at the tip of the thumb of g5p (11Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). The active site cysteines (Cys32 and Cys35) and Arg73-Gly74-Ile75-Pro76 of thioredoxin are buried in the 71-amino acid loop. Only reduced thioredoxin can bind to g5p (12Alder S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How thioredoxin increases the processivity of g5p is not clearly understood. Incorporation of the thioredoxin binding area of g5p into the thumb of E. coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase) also increased its processivity in a thioredoxin-dependent manner (13Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate further the interaction between thioredoxin and g5p, we have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to determine in real-time the association (ka) and dissociation (kd) rate constants rates and the resulting equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). The effect of temperature on KD was used to calculate changes in Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy that occur when g5p interacts with thioredoxin. HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20), CM5 chip (research grade), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), N-(ethyl),N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC), ethanolamine hydrochloride solution (pH 8.5), were obtained from Biacore. 6-Amino-n-hexanoic acid was from Sigma. Wild type thioredoxin was overexpressed in E. coli strain SK 3981 containing plasmid pBHK8 with the trxA gene inserted in pBR325 (13Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 479-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). All mutants were prepared previously (14Lunn C.A. Kathju S. Wallace B.J. Kushner S.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol.

Fuchs (Department of Biochemistry, Gortner laboratory, St. Paul, MN). Thioredoxins were purified as described before (17Dyson J.H. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7074-7087Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). g5p was purified from E. coli BH 215/pRS 101 (18Reutimann H. Sjöberg B.-M. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6783-6787Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using an Affi-Gel-thioredoxin affinity chromatography method (19Slaby I. Holmgren A. Prot. Expr. Purif. 1991; 2: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The following extinction coefficients at 280 nm were used: 13,700 m–1·cm–1 for wild type thioredoxin and mutants D26A, C35A, P34S, P40G, and Y49F; 8,200 m–1·cm–1 for thioredoxin W31A, W31H, and W28A; 10,400 m–1·cm–1 for thioredoxin W31Y; 8,300 m–1·cm–1 for thioredoxin W31F; 134,000 m–1·cm–1 for g5p. Immobilization of Thioredoxin—Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out using a Biacore 1000 instrument. In initial experiments, thioredoxin was immobilized directly on the dextran surface of a CM5 chip after its activation with 2× 40 μl of a 1:1 mixture of NHS (75 mg/ml) and EDC (11.5 mg/ml). Thioredoxin was then injected (40–60 μl of 50–100 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.25, and remaining active groups were blocked with 40 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. Immobilized thioredoxin was reduced (60 μl of 1 μg/ml of E. coli thioredoxin reductase and 8 mm NADPH in HBS) and treated with 2 × 10 μl of glycine buffer, pH 11.2, to remove any non-covalently bound protein. Extensive washes with HBS, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) preceded g5p injections. Our work mainly involved thioredoxins immobilized on a CM5 chip through 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid, a six-carbon spacer. The dextran surface was activated with a 1:1 mixture of NHS and EDC, 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid (60 μl of 1 m, pH 8.5) was injected over the activated surface, and unreacted activated groups were blocked by ethanolamine. The carboxylic acid group of immobilized 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid was activated (40 μl of 1:1 NHS-EDC), reduced thioredoxin species were injected (40–60 μl of 50–100 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.25), and remaining activated groups were blocked with ethanolamine. The chip was washed with glycine buffer (2 × 10 μl, pH 11.2) to remove any non-covalently bound protein and finally kept in HBS. Throughout all immobilizations, the flow rate was kept at 5 μl/min except for the immobilization of 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid which was performed at 4 μl/min. Immobilization of thioredoxins was kept at 200–800 resonance units. Interaction of g5p with Trx-(SH)2—The association of g5p and Trx-(SH)2 was followed at 25 °C by injecting 75 μl of 50–250 nm g5p in HBS with 2.5 mm DTT. Injection of g5p was initiated 400 s after the beginning of sensorgram monitoring and estimations for ka took into consideration the 400–1250 s part. Dissociation was monitored in HBS, 2.5 mm DTT (150 μl), 1250 s after the beginning of sensorgram monitoring. Estimations for kd were based on the data for 1250–2450 s. Any residual bound g5p was removed by 10 μl of glycine buffer, pH 11.2. To investigate the effect of temperature on dissociation constants, experiments were carried out at 20, 25, and 30 °C with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Prior to injection, g5p was kept at the respective temperature of interaction. Thioredoxin was reduced immediately after immobilization and after 10–15 injections of g5p with 2.5 mm DTT. Interaction of g5p with Trx-S2—Thioredoxin, immobilized on a CM5 chip through 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid, was oxidized by injecting 60 μlof 10 mg/ml 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in HBS. Association kinetics analyses were performed using freshly prepared g5p in HBS (75 μl of 40–100 nm), free of DTT. Dissociation was monitored over 30 min in HBS. Analysis of Sensorgrams—kd and ka were obtained by a non-linear fit of the dissociation and association parts of the sensorgram using BIA evaluation software version 2.1 supplied by the manufacturer (Biacore). The theoretical background and analysis details are described in the Biatechnology Handbook (Biacore). Bulk effect was eliminated by subtracting a control sensorgram obtained by injecting analyte (g5p) over a sensor chip surface derivatized with 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid (control), from the sensorgram, which represented interaction of thioredoxin and g5p. We have analyzed the association and dissociation phases of each experiment considering the interaction (i) homogeneous (single exponential) and (ii) heterogeneous with respect to ligand (two exponentials). Most results fitted well a model of two exponentials. KD was obtained from the ratio of kd/ka. Thermodynamic Parameters—The Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) was calculated from the relation ΔG =–RTln(KA), where R is the gas constant, T is temperature in the absolute scale, and KA (1/KD) is the equilibrium association constant. R was taken as 1.9875 cal·mol–1·K–1. The enthalpy of complex formation or change in enthalpy (ΔH) was obtained from the van't Hoff equation,dln(KA)/d(1/T)=−ΔH/RT and ΔH was calculated from the slope (ΔH/R) of a plot of–ln(KA) against 1/T. A linear plot is obtained if ΔH and change in entropy (ΔS) are not depended on temperature. ΔS was calculated from ΔG and ΔH using the following equation.ΔG=ΔH−TΔS Calculation of the Activation Energy—The effect of temperature on the reaction rate constant is given by the Arrhenius equation,k=A×exp(−E/RT) where k is the reaction rate constant at temperature T, E is the activation energy, and A is the activation frequency of the reaction. Values of E were calculated from the slope (–E/R) of the linear fit of the plots of ln(ka) or ln(kd) against 1/T. Immobilization of Trx-(SH)2and Interaction with g5p—Thioredoxin was initially immobilized directly on CM5 chips using amine coupling chemistry. Only 20% of the immobilized Trx-(SH)2 could complex g5p. Kinetic analysis of the sensorgrams using a two-exponential model gave two KD values (9.2 and 52 nm), indicating heterogeneity of the immobilized thioredoxin. The higher affinity constant was about 90% of the total SPR response. Studies employing enzymatic activity measurements have given apparent KD values (Kobs) in the area of 5 nm (20Dyson J.H. Jeng M.-F. Tennant L.L. Slaby I. Lindel M. Cui D.-S. Kuprin S. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2622-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It could be that binding of thioredoxin directly to the dextran surface hindered the interaction with g5p. To examine if this was the case, thioredoxin was immobilized on dextran through 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid, a six-carbon spacer. The resulting sensorgrams (Fig. 1) fitted well a double-exponential model (Fig. 2) and gave two sets of kinetic parameters (Table I), suggesting again a heterogeneous population of bound thioredoxin. The KD value of 2.2 nm corresponded to about 90% of the response and was chosen therefore as the “accepted” KD value. To minimize mass transport effects, only low amounts of thioredoxin (200–800 resonance units) were immobilized. The KD value obtained by SPR (2.2 nm) indicated very strong binding between Trx-(SH)2 and g5p. The result is explainable in terms of very fast association and slow dissociation. The decrease in association rate constant (ka), which was observed with increasing concentration of g5p, is reflected in the calculated KD values (Table I). It should be mentioned that g5p could not be used as an alternative immobile phase, because it binds nonspecifically to the inactivated dextran surface (data not shown).Fig. 2Curve fitting of the association (A) and dissociation (B) sensorgrams for wild type Trx-(SH)2 and g5p. The left y-axis in A corresponds to a recorded association phase sensorgram and the resulting curve fit, shown as a superimposed continuous line. In B, the left y-axis corresponds to a sensorgram of the dissociation phase and the curve fit resulting. In both A and B, the right y-axes correspond to the residual values (dots in the diagram) for the respective curve fits.

Sensorgrams fitted well a two-exponential model apart from mutant W31F whose sensorgrams corresponded to a single-exponential model.

Open table in a new tab Interaction of g5p with Trx-S2—The interaction of g5p with Trx-S2 (Fig. 4) was examined using thioredoxin immobilized through 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid. In buffers free of DTT, Trx-S2 did not interact with g5p. To demonstrate that g5p free of DTT had normal binding properties, immobilized Trx-S2 was reduced (5 mm DTT), and then its complexation with g5p free of DTT was examined. Trx-(SH)2 could bind g5p devoid of DTT. The integrity of DTT-free g5p was further confirmed by DNA polymerase assays when 100% activity was recovered after addition of DTT (data not shown). Thermodynamic Parameters for the Wild Type Trx-(SH)2·g5p Complex—To monitor changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of the Trx-(SH)2·g5p complex, binding constants were determined at 20, 25, and 30 °C (Table III). KD values increased from 1.1 to 4.3 nm while temperature increased from 20 to 30 °C, implying that the binding of g5p to thioredoxin was an exothermic reaction. The increase of KD values was mainly due to the increase in respective kd values, whereas ka values remained almost the same. Very little increase in ka values with concomitant increase in temperature indicated a low energy barrier for complex formation. No major conformation changes are therefore expected upon complexation. The plot of–ln(KA) versus 1/T, gave a linear fit (Fig. 5). We assumed that the enthalpy change of the reaction (ΔH) would remain constant in the temperature range of the experimental, and the linearity observed in the van't Hoff plot (ln(KD) versus 1/T) indicated that this was the case. The calculated enthalpy change (ΔH) was–20.2 kcal· m–1, the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) at 298 K was–11.8 kcal·m–1, and the entropy change for the interaction was–8.4 kcal·m–1. These values suggested that the complex formation of Trx-(SH)2 with g5p is driven by enthalpy and opposed by entropy. Similar observations were reported for antigen-antibody and protein-protein interactions (21Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The plot of ln(ka) against 1/T gave a good linear fit with a root mean square deviation value of 0.976 (Fig. 6A). The calculated value of the activation energy for the forward reaction was estimated as 3.94 kcal·m–1. A linear fit was obtained for the plot of ln(kd) versus 1/T with a root mean square deviation of 0.998 (Fig. 6B). The activation energy for the backward reaction was found to be 24.27 kcal·m–1. The enthalpy of binding was–20.23 kcal·m–1, compared with –20.2 kcal·m–1, which was the value obtained from the van't Hoff plot. This showed internal consistency of the results. The very fast complex formation rate between g5p and Trx-(SH)2 (ka = 4.7 × 104·m–1·s–1) is therefore due to a very low activation energy barrier. The interaction of g5p with thioredoxin has been the object of many studies (12Alder S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Dyson J.H.

This is not a real KD value but stands for a set of reactions with the concentration of thioredoxin in the assay being critical for the determination of Kobs (3Huber H.E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16224-16232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The method has proved extremely useful for the comparison of the affinities of different mutants of thioredoxin to g5p (28Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used SPR in an attempt to determine “real” KD values. Preliminary SPR data showed that thioredoxin immobilized directly on the dextran surface is not accessible to g5p, and distorted binding properties were obtained. Immobilization of thioredoxin through a six-carbon spacer (6-amino-n-hexanoic acid) eliminated most steric effects and gave binding kinetics estimates (KD = 2.2 nm) in the range of those obtained for the interaction of the two proteins in solution (Kobs = 5 nm). The introduction of 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid as a spacer could perhaps facilitate more SPR studies concerning the interaction of small peptides with large molecules. For example, the method could be applicable in the interaction of peptide epitopes and their respective antibodies. Reduced thioredoxin bound tightly to g5p (KD = 2.2 nm). This is because of fast association (ka = 4.7 × 104·m–1·s–1) and very slow dissociation (kd = 10.5 × 10–5·s–1). In this respect, the interaction between g5p and Trx-(SH)2 is very similar to antigen-antibody interaction (30Hanin V. Dery O. Boquet D. Sagot M.A. Creminon C. Couraud J.Y. Grassi J. Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 31England P. Bregegere F. Bedouelle H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 164-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The fast association rate constant (ka), not changing with increasing temperature, indicated a low activation barrier for the complex formation and suggested no major conformational changes upon complexation. The calculated free energy change (ΔG) at 298 K was–11.8 kcal·m–1. In comparison, the ΔG value for the lysozyme-antibody interaction was–11.4 kcal·m–1 and for bovine trypsin and its inhibitor was–18.1 kcal·m–1 (32Xu D. Lin S.L. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The plot of ln(kd) versus 1/T gave an almost straight line indicating that the enthalpy change (ΔH) of the reaction was insensitive to the temperature range of the experiment. The increase in KD values (Kobs) for the interaction of thioredoxin with g5p has been observed before (28Huber H.E. Russel M. Model P. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15006-15012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of entropy (TΔS) for the thioredoxin·g5p complex was 8.4 kcal·m–1, whereas for most of protein-protein interactions it is about 5–6 kcal·m–1 (32Xu D. Lin S.L. Nussinov R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Overall negative entropy change implies that the decrease in the translational-rotational and conformational entropies due to the thioredoxin·g5p complex formation is not fully compensated by the increase in solvent entropy. An explanation can be provided in terms of the newly ordered water molecules bound in and around the interface of the Trx-(SH)2·g5p complex leading to an overall decrease of the solvent entropy (21Davies D.R. Cohen G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In accordance to previous studies (12Alder S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that Trx-S2 was unable to induce polymerase activity to g5p, because it did not interact at all with g5p (Figs. 2 and 3). Reduced and oxidized thioredoxins are very similar in their tertiary structure. However, regions 20–22, 29–32, 73–75, and 93–94 are more mobile in reduced thioredoxin (5Holmgren A. Söderberg B.-O Eklund H. Brändén C.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2305-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 33Stone M.J. Chandrasekhar K. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), which can thus attain structural states not accessible to Trx-S2 (33Stone M.J. Chandrasekhar K. Holmgren A. Wright P.E. Dyson J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 426-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of T7 DNA polymerase shows that g5p interacts closely with the area of the active site cysteines and Arg73-Pro76 of thioredoxin. In addition, mutational studies have shown that the loops containing Gly74 (29Himawan J.S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19999-20008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and Gly92 (34Holmgren A. Kallis G.-B. Nordstrom B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3118-3124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are important for binding to g5p. Apparently, reduced thioredoxin can bind g5p, because it is more flexible in areas involved in the binding between the two proteins. The thioredoxin binding domain of g5p itself is also marked by increased mobility (20Dyson J.H. Jeng M.-F. Tennant L.L. Slaby I. Lindel M. Cui D.-S. Kuprin S. Holmgren A.

https://openalex.org/W2019780361,"We have recently shown that the stability of the alternatively expressed immunoglobulin M heavy chain secretory mRNA is developmentally regulated by U1A. U1A binds novel non-consensus sites upstream of the secretory poly(A) site and inhibits poly(A) tail addition in undifferentiated cells. U1A's dependence for binding and function upon a stem-loop structure has been extensively characterized for the consensus sites. We therefore probed the structure surrounding the novel U1A binding sites. We show that two of the three novel binding sites represent the major single-stranded regions upstream of the secretory poly(A) site, consistent with a major role at this site. The strength of binding and ability of U1A to inhibit poly(A) polymerase correlate with the accessibility of the novel sites. However, long range interactions are responsible for maintaining them in an open configuration. Mutation of an RNase V1-sensitive site 102 nucleotides upstream, directly adjacent to the competing 5′ splice site, changes the structure of one the U1A binding sites and thus abolishes the binding of the second U1A molecule and the ability of U1A ability to inhibit poly(A) polymerase activity at this site. These sites bind U1A via its N-terminal domain but with a 10-fold lower affinity than U1 small nuclear RNA. This lower binding affinity is more conducive to U1A's regulation of poly(A) tail addition to heterologous mRNA.

This lower binding affinity is more conducive to U1A's regulation of poly(A) tail addition to heterologous mRNA. The major source of diversity in metazoans is the ability to process pre-mRNA into alternative mRNAs via the selection of alternative splice sites and alternative 3′-ends, giving rise to a range of proteins encoded by the same gene that are differentially expressed during growth and development (for review see Ref. 1Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). An important pattern of alternative processing involves a competition between splicing on of extra exons and 3′-end cleavage at an upstream site, which cuts off these exons (for review see Ref. 2Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). This group includes a number of important receptors involved in growth and differentiation. The best characterized model for this pattern is the IgM heavy chain gene, which is alternatively processed into mRNAs that encode a membrane receptor or secreted antibody during differentiation (3Early P. Rogers J. Davis M. Calame K. Bond M. Wall R. Hood L. Cell. 1980; 20: 313-319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). To prevent inappropriate expression of secreted antibody in undifferentiated cells, the stability of secretory mRNA is highly controlled. Changes in stability of the secretory mRNA during differentiation play a major role in the dramatic burst of production of secreted antibody once B cells differentiate into immunoglobulin secreting cells (4Lamson G. Koshland M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 877-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 5Cox A. Emtage J.S.

Immunol. 1990; 20: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 3′-End cleavage in metazoans takes place upon the recognition of a bi-partite poly(A) signal consisting of a consensus AAUAAA and a less defined GU-rich sequence, upstream and downstream of the cleavage site, respectively, by components of the cleavage/polyadenylation complex. These consist of the multimeric cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor and cleavage stimulatory factor, cleavage factors I and II, and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, poly(A) polymerase; PIE, polyadenylation inhibitory element; snRNA, small nuclear RNA; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. (reviewed in Ref. 8Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After cleavage the RNA is specifically polyadenylated by PAP tethered to the RNA via the 160-kDa component of cleavage polyadenylation specificity factor, bound by the hexanucleotide sequence (9Murthy K.G. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2672-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail during 3′-end processing within the nucleus, and this is coupled to efficient export of mRNAs to the cytoplasm (10Eckner R. Ellmeier W. Biernstiel M.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3513-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Huang Y. Carmichael G.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). mRNAs that fail to acquire a poly(A) tail are retained at or near transcription sites and degraded by the nuclear exosome (12Hilleren P. McCarthy T. Rosbash M. Parker R. Jensen T.H. Nature. 2001; 413: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the change in stability is regulated by the addition of a poly(A) tail to the secretory mRNA (13Phillips C. Jung S. Gunderson S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6443-6452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The U1A protein binds upstream of the secretory poly(A) site and inhibits polyadenylation of the secretory mRNA in a developmentally regulated manner. We demonstrated that U1A inhibits poly(A) addition to the heterologous μ-secretory poly(A) site. This inhibition depends on sequences that resemble the consensus (AUUGCAC) U1A binding site but are non-consensus (A(U/G)GCN1–3C) (13Phillips C. Jung S. Gunderson S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6443-6452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These sequences are ingeniously located in the intron that is spliced out upon formation of the membrane mRNA; i.e. between the 5′ splice site and the secretory poly(A) site. In this way they are not present in the membrane form of mRNA and do not regulate poly(A) addition to this form of mRNA. Thus the U1A selectively regulates expression of the upstream poly(A) site. In addition, the effect of U1A is exerted more strongly in undifferentiated cells in which the membrane form is predominantly expressed. In this way leaky recognition of the secretory poly(A) site in undifferentiated cells does not lead to the formation of viable secretory mRNA at an inappropriate stage. The ability of U1A to regulate poly(A) polymerase activity was first demonstrated in an autoregulatory system in which two molecules of U1A bind a complicated stem loop structure called the polyadenylation inhibitory element (PIE) immediately upstream of its own hexanucleotide sequence (14vanGelder C.W.G. Gunderson S.I. Jansen E.J.R. Boelens W.C. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Venrooij W.J.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The binding of U1A to its consensus sequence on U1 snRNA and on PIE RNA has been extensively studied both biochemically and by NMR and crystallography (14vanGelder C.W.G. Gunderson S.I. Jansen E.J.R.

Hall K.B. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 55-63PubMed Google Scholar), the stem-loop structure of the binding site has also been shown to be essential for maintaining the binding site in an accessible configuration and for making contact with certain U1A residues (14vanGelder C.W.G. Gunderson S.I. Jansen E.J.R. Boelens W.C. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Venrooij W.J.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Scherly D.

We therefore wanted to determine the secondary structure surrounding the novel U1A binding sites upstream of the μ-secretory poly(A) site. We show that the U1A binding sites are the major accessible regions upstream of the secretory poly(A) site, consistent with a major role at this site. These structures are dependent on the flanking sequences, which control the accessibility and function of the U1A binding sites. We identify the sequences in the 5′ flanking sequence necessary for the structure of the hexanucleotide proximal (8s) U1A binding site and find that they are directly adjacent to the 5′ splice site involved in the competing splicing reaction. Plasmid Constructs—For in vitro transcription the PCR products from the secretory poly(A) site and surrounding sequences, containing mutations and a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ XbaI site, introduced as part of the synthetic primers, were cloned into pGem 3Zf (containing a T7 promoter in the forward direction) between the EcoRI and XbaI sites. The forward primers were as follows: for V1S1 and 2, CCGGAATTCCGGACCGTGGACAAGTggtgaGGTAAACCCtgtgTGTACAATGTCTCCCTGATCATGTCTG; for V1S1, CCGGAATTCCGGACCGTGGACAAGTggtgacGGTAAACCCACACTGT ACAATGTCTCC; and for V1S2, CCGGAATTCCGGACCGTGGACAAGTCCACTGGGTAAACCCtgtgTGTACAATGTCTCCCTGATCATGTCTG.

RNA Substrates—Templates for in vitro binding assays (EMSAs) were obtained by restriction of the pGem 3Zf constructs with XbaI or DdeI. Uniformly labeled RNA substrates were synthesized by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as previously described (28Phillips C. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Transcripts that were 5′-end-labeled were obtained by the same protocol, substituting [γ-32P]GTP as the radiolabeled nucleotide. RNA substrates that were 3′-end-labeled were synthesized by the same protocol omitting [α-32P]UTP. The cold RNA was subsequently labeled at the 3′-end with [5′-32P]Cp using T4 RNA ligase as previously described (29Phillips C. Kyriakopoulou C.B. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All transcripts were purified by extraction after electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 7 m urea. Recombinant Proteins—Untagged recombinant wild type U1A and U1A1–117 were purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (30Boelens W.C. Jansen E.J.R. Venrooij W.J.V. Stripecke R. Mattaj I.W.

Recombinant bovine poly(A) polymerase, tagged at the C terminus with 6 histidines, was purified from E. coli on Ni2+-NTA. The Histagged C terminus ensured that all of the C-terminal residues were present after purification (31Gunderson S.I. Vagner S. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 761-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RNA Secondary Structural Probing and Footprinting—Probing of the secondary structure of RNA was carried out as previously described (29Phillips C. Kyriakopoulou C.B. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, all RNA substrates were first refolded by heating in reaction buffer at 70 °C for 2 min followed by cooling to 37 °C over a 30-min period. For RNase T1, RNase V1 and lead (II) cleavage, 10,000 cpm of 3′- or 5′-end-labeled RNA substrate was incubated at 37 °C in a total volume of 5 μl with either 0.4-0.001 unit of RNase T1 (Roche Applied Science) or 0.072–0.00072 unit of RNase V1 (originally Amersham Biosciences, kind gift of Jean Patterson) in 50 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 for 5 min or 0.1–0.5 mm Pb(OAc)2 in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm, NH4Cl, and 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 m urea, 25 mm EDTA. Samples were analyzed on 15% PAGE containing 7 m urea. A reference nucleotide ladder was made by boiling of substrates with 50 mm NaOH, 10 mm EDTA for 10 s. Footprints were obtained by adding U1A before T1 digestion. These reactions were stopped by the addition of 180 μl of proteinase K buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mm EDTA, 230 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS) and 50 μg of proteinase K and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. This was followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation before loading on PAGE as above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Poly(A) Addition Assays—A U1A binding assay were performed as previously described (14vanGelder C.W.G. Gunderson S.I. Jansen E.J.R. Boelens W.C. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Mattaj I.W. Venrooij W.J.V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5191-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA substrate per lane and recombinant U1A as indicated. Nonspecific poly(A) addition assays were performed as previously described (32Gunderson S.I. Beyer K. Martin G. Keller W. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1994; 76: 531-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) with 50 ng of recombinant poly(A) polymerase, and incubations were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. U1A binding sites are in the major accessible regions upstream of the secretory poly(A) site—Fig. 1A is a schematic diagram of the alternative processing of the μ-heavy chain pre-mRNA, showing that the μ-secretory poly(A) site is located within the intron used to splice on the membrane exons. Fig. 1B shows the precise positions of the various elements known to be important for μ-secretory mRNA expression mentioned in the introduction, including the location of the U1A binding motifs, as well as the location of the 5′- and 3′-ends of the RNA substrate used in this report. It also shows the proximity between the 5′ splice site of this intron and the μ-secretory poly(A) site used for the μ-secretory mRNA. Positions are numbered according to the mouse IgM sequence with accession number V00818. Fig. 1C shows the sequence between 1838 and 1950, which we have previously scanned with mutation (mut1 through mut10), and the position of the 2s, 4s, and 8s mutations of the three novel U1A binding sites. Because U1A binding to the consensus sequence on U1 snRNA is dependent upon a particular RNA hairpin stem-loop structure, we wanted to probe the structure surrounding the novel U1A binding sites that we have recently identified upstream of the μ-secretory poly(A) site. For this we used partial RNase T1 digestion. Substrates were digested with limiting amounts of RNase T1 for 5 min and then immediately run on 15% denaturing PAGE. RNase T1 cuts 3′ to Gs with a preference for single-stranded RNA. Thus Gs that give a strong pattern of cuts will be situated in the single-stranded region of hairpin loops or bulges (33Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). At first we examined the pattern of RNase T1 digestion of 3′-end-labeled IgM (1970–2085) substrate, which spans all the known important elements involved in regulation of expression of μ-secretory mRNA (Fig. 2A). These include the upstream 5′ splice site, the novel U1A binding sites, the hexanucleotide sequence, and both downstream GU-rich regions. In this way the RNA structure surrounding the U1A binding sites will be preserved in a larger context and more accurately represents the physiological structure. A single-nucleotide ladder was generated by hydroxy radical cleavage and served as a marker for nucleotide position (Fig. 2A, lane 1). The deepest RNase T1 cuts occur around the hexanucleotide sequence and the cleavage/polyadenylation site (1971–2007), which is predicted to form a loop containing these sequences in a form accessible to components of the polyadenylation and cleavage complex (and RNase T1) (Fig. 2A, lanes 3–8). The proximal and distal GU-rich regions are also accessible (labeled on Fig. 2A). The region of RNA surrounding the U1A binding motifs (Gs at 1854, 1877, and 1925) is indicated by a bracket. It can be seen from Fig. 2A that these are the major accessible regions upstream of the hexanucleotide sequence. We labeled the IgM-(1790–2085) RNA substrate either at the 3′-end or at the 5′-end and ran the gels long enough to be able to accurately determine the position of the T1 cuts in the region surrounding the U1A binding motifs (1854–1930) and were able to identify a reproducible pattern. The RNase T1 partial digestion of the 5′-end-labeled wild type substrate is shown in Fig. 2B (lane 2). A distinct reproducible pattern of cuts can be seen around U1A binding motifs 4s (1875–1882) and 8s (1923–1930) (Fig. 2B, lane 2). The 8s motif consists of one deep cut (1925) and two lighter cuts (1919 and 1921) that are closer to a mirror image set of cuts between the two U1A binding motifs (1903). The 4s motif consists of a pattern of two deep cuts (1871 and 1877) followed by two further cuts (1881 and 1883). The U1A binding motifs are labeled individually in Fig. 2B (8s, 4s, and 2s). The 2s motif was not RNase T1-sensitive. To confirm the identities of the cuts ascertained by comparison with the hydroxy ladder, we employed mutants that replace the AUGC (or AGGC) motifs with AAAA (see Fig. 1C). These mutations abolish U1A binding (13Phillips C. Jung S. Gunderson S.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6443-6452Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As the G is replaced by an A, these mutants lose the ability to be cut by RNase T1 at that site. It can be seen in Fig. 2B that mutation of either the 4s or 8s site results in the loss of the deep cuts at 1877 or 1925, respectively (see asterisks in lane 3 and 4). This confirms that these accessible sites are at the position of the novel U1A binding sites. To further confirm that open structures form around the 4s and 8s U1A binding sites, we performed lead cleavage analysis, which we have successfully used previously to identify bulges in RNA structure (29Phillips C. Kyriakopoulou C.B. Virtanen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Lead (II) cleavage patterning is a technique to probe tertiary structures of RNA (34Hüttenhofer A. Westhof E. Böck A. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 354-366PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, lead (II) preferably cleaves at bulges of RNA structure independent of nucleotide sequence (35Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). It can be seen that lead cuts around the hexanucleotide sequence, and two patterns of cuts form around the 4s and 8s U1A binding sites (lane 6). Taken together these data show that the 4s and 8s novel U1A binding sites are the major accessible regions upstream of the hexanucleotide sequence. We noted that the pattern of RNase T1 cuts surrounding the 8s binding motif changes only in the region of the 8s mutation, in that the deep cut at 1925 is lost (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, for the 4s mutation, the pattern of RNase T1 cuts surrounding the (1875–1882) motif changes more extensively (compare lanes 2 and 3), suggesting a remodeling of the surrounding area upon 4s mutation. Is the Double-stranded 2s Motif Remodeled upon U1A Binding?—To determine the extent of remodeling with the 4s mutation and to further probe the structure surrounding the 2s binding site, we performed RNase V1 partial digestion. RNase V1 preferentially cuts double-stranded RNA (33Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). It can be seen in Fig. 3A that the 2s motif lies within a double-stranded region (lane 2). In fact it appears to be within a symmetrical structure consisting of four RNase V1-sensitive sites. The 8s mutation once again appears not to be remodeled as probed by RNase V1 (compare lanes 2 and 6). In contrast, the 4s mutation leads to remodeling of the RNase V1-sensitive sites from 1911 to 1858 (compare lanes 2 and 4, labeled with a bar in lane 4). The RNase V1-sensitive site at 1855 (the 2s motif) is still visible but diminished in the 4s mutation (compare lanes 2 and 4). We wondered whether the susceptibility this region to remodeling upon mutation of the AUGC motif might reflect its ability to be remodeled upon U1A binding this motif. We therefore attempted to footprint the RNA with U1A to look for changes in RNase T1 accessibility upon U1A binding. As can be seen in Fig. 3B, with 80 ng of U1A a footprint begins to appear over the 4s site but not the 8s site (lane 3, asterisk). No change in the pattern of RNase T1 digestion can be seen at the 2s site at this concentration. At higher concentrations all bands appear lighter (data not shown). We conclude that the lack of a definite footprint is due to the low affinity with which U1A binds these sites. Thus, whether or not U1A binding at 4s remodels the 2s site cannot be determined from this approach. Similarly, Teunissen et al. (36Teunissen S.W.M. vanGerlder C.W.G. vanVenrooij W.J. Biochem. 1997; 36: 1782-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) found that the whole region surrounding the U1A binding sites on PIE RNA was footprinted and changes in structure could not be monitored. Nevertheless, this experiment here suggests that 4s is the first site to bind U1A. The Flanking Sequences Are Necessary to Maintain the Structure of the U1A Binding Sites—As a first step to determine the secondary structure surrounding the single-stranded U1A binding motifs, we were interested in knowing the minimal RNA sequence that could maintain the U1A binding sites in accessible regions. For this we tested the effect of deleting the 5′ and 3′ flanking regions. The substrates were 3′-endlabeled and run for 5 h on 15% gels so that the pattern surrounding the U1A binding sites was well separated and that the pattern surrounding the hexanucleotide sequence was retained within the gel for convenient reference. The pattern of RNase T1 digestion in the whole substrate, which can be used as a reference point, can be seen in lanes 9–14 of Fig. 4A. We performed a partial RNase T1 digest of 3′-end-labeled substrates, with or without the flanking regions to look for changes in RNA structure brought about by the addition of the flanking sequences. The results are presented in Fig. 4 (A and B), and the pattern of cuts for each substrate is summarized in the schematic diagram in C. A longer exposure of the gel allows visualization of lighter cuts for better comparison. Deletion of the 5′ flanking region alone (IgM-(1838–2085), Fig. 4A, lanes 2–7) results in the loss of the deep cut at 1925 and only a slight diminution of the cut at 1877. On the other hand, deletion of the 3′ flanking region alone, which spans the downstream stem-loop (IgM-(1790–2030), Fig. 4B, lanes 9–14), results in the diminution of cuts surrounding 1877, whereas those at 1903 and 1925 are maintained. The diminution of the cut at 4s is dependent upon the presence of the 5′ flanking region (1790–1838), because there is almost no difference in its intensity between IgM-(1838–2085) and IgM-(1838–2030), which are both greater than when the 5′ flanking region is present. The 4s cut at 1877 is only 50 nucleotides from the end of the substrate when the 5′ flanking sequence is missing and may be more accessible for this reason. We presume that a comparison of the fate of the 4s cut upon deletion of the 3′flanking sequence has more physiological relevance in the longer substrate, which includes the 5′ flanking regions, but that sequences in the 5′ flanking region have a small effect on the 4s site. Deletion of both 5′ and 3′ flanking regions results in the complete disruption of the RNA structure surrounding the hexanucleotide sequence and a new deep cut appears in the 1938–54 region (Fig. 4B, lanes 2–7). The region between 1925 and 1903 is remodeled, and the deep cuts at 1925 and 1903 are lost. In both substrates missing the 5′ flanking region, a cut appears at 1855 in the region surrounding the 2s (1854–1860) binding motif (see IgM-(1838–2085) and IgM-(1838–2030), Fig. 4A, lanes 1–7 and Fig. 4B, lanes 1–7, respectively). From this we conclude that sequences 5′ of 1838 are necessary to maintain the 2s binding site in an inaccessible form. From consideration of the pattern of sites affected by the respective flanking regions, a “criss-cross” pattern emerges: Deletion of the 3′ flanking sequence has the greatest effect on the cut at 1877 (compare substrate IgM-(1790–2085) with IgM-(1790–2030), Fig. 4A, lanes 8–14 with Fig. 4B, lanes 8–14, respectively). In contrast, deletion of the 5′ flanking region has the most effect on the 1925 cut and results in the appearance of the cut at 1855 (compare substrate IgM-(1790–2085) with IgM-(1838–2085), Fig. 4A, lanes 8–14 with Fig. 4A, lanes 1–7, respectively). Thus the 3′ flanking region affects the 4s U1A binding site, whereas the 5′ flanking sequence affects the 8s U1A binding site in a criss-cross effect. However, the 5′ flanking region also affects both the 4s and the 2s site and appears to have a greater effect on the 8s motif than does the 3′ flanking sequence on the 4s motif. These effects are summarized in Fig. 4C. The Accessibility of the U1A Binding Sites Correlates with the Strength of Binding of U1A and Its Ability to Inhibit Poly(A) Addition in Vitro—We next wanted to test if the accessibility of the U1A binding sites had an effect on U1A binding. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays comparing the various substrates using uniformly labeled in vitro transcribed RNA substrates and recombinant non-tagged full-length wild type U1A. U1A binds the substrate IgM-(1838–2030) that spans the U1A binding motifs, the hexanucleotide sequence of the poly(A) site, and the proximal GU-rich region (Fig. 5A, lanes 1–4) (see Fig. 1 for location of sequences). Inclusion of the sequence 2030–2085 enhances the binding (lanes 5–8). This sequence spans a stem-loop structure that includes the distal GU-rich region and is necessary for full polyadenylation activity. However, this sequence does not bind U1A on its own (data not shown). We next tested the effect of 5′ flanking sequences. Adding 5′ flanking sequences (1790–1838) greatly increased U1A binding to both the IgM-(1838–2030) and IgM-(1838–2085) substrate (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 1–4 with 9–12 and lanes 5–8 with 13–16, respectively). Thus both the 3′ and 5′ flanking sequences separately enhance the binding of U1A to the substrate, although inclusion of the 5′ flanking sequence has a greater effect than the 3′ flanking sequence. Furthermore, 5′ and 3′ flanking sequences in combination enhance this binding further (Fig. 5A, lanes 13–16). Thus the strength of binding correlates with the accessibility of the binding sites determined by the RNase T1 partial digestion (compare Figs. 4 and 5). Because the extra sequences at either end of the U1A binding sites do not bind U1A themselves, we conclude that the flanking sequences, in particular the 5′ flanking sequence, contribute to the enhanced binding by helping to maintain the binding sequences in an accessible configuration. We note that, on all substrates wit"
https://openalex.org/W1991222457,"Rad17-Mec3-Ddc1 forms a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-like complex that is required for the DNA damage response in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> and acts at an early step of the signal transduction cascade activated by DNA lesions.

Our data indicate that the Rad17-Mec3-Ddc1 complex is very stable, and it takes several hours to replace Mec3 with Mec3-dn within a wild type complex. On the other hand, the mutant complex is rapidly assembled when starting from a condition where the complex is not pre-assembled, indicating that the critical factor for the substitution is the disassembly step rather than complex formation. Moreover, the kinetics of mutant complex assembly, starting from conditions in which the wild type form is present, parallels the kinetics of checkpoint inactivation, suggesting that the complex acts in a stoichiometric way, rather than catalytically."
