https://openalex.org/W2140313980,"The ryanodine receptor (RyR)/calcium release channel on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the major source of calcium (Ca2+) required for cardiac muscle excitation-contraction (EC) coupling. The channel is a tetramer comprised of four type 2 RyR polypeptides (RyR2) and four FK506 binding proteins (FKBP12.6). We show that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation of RyR2 dissociates FKBP12.6 and regulates the channel open probability (Po). Using cosedimentation and coimmunoprecipitation we have defined a macromolecular complex comprised of RyR2, FKBP12.6, PKA, the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, and an anchoring protein, mAKAP. In failing human hearts, RyR2 is PKA hyperphosphorylated, resulting in defective channel function due to increased sensitivity to Ca2+-induced activation."

https://openalex.org/W2614575602,"Chromosome 21 is the smallest human autosome. An extra copy of chromosome 21 causes Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic cause of significant mental retardation, which affects up to 1 in 700 live births. Several anonymous loci for monogenic disorders and predispositions for common complex disorders have also been mapped to this chromosome, and loss of heterozygosity has been observed in regions associated with solid tumours. Here we report the sequence and gene catalogue of the long arm of chromosome 21. We have sequenced 33,546,361 base pairs (bp) of DNA with very high accuracy, the largest contig being 25,491,867 bp. Only three small clone gaps and seven sequencing gaps remain, comprising about 100 kilobases. Thus, we achieved 99.7% coverage of 21q. We also sequenced 281,116 bp from the short arm. The structural features identified include duplications that are probably involved in chromosomal abnormalities and repeat structures in the telomeric and pericentromeric regions. Analysis of the chromosome revealed 127 known genes, 98 predicted genes and 59 pseudogenes."

https://openalex.org/W4248042899,"Distinct classes of neurons are generated at defined positions in the ventral neural tube in response to a gradient of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) activity. A set of homeodomain transcription factors expressed by neural progenitors act as intermediaries in Shh-dependent neural patterning. These homeodomain factors fall into two classes: class I proteins are repressed by Shh and class II proteins require Shh signaling for their expression. The profile of class I and class II protein expression defines five progenitor domains, each of which generates a distinct class of postmitotic neurons. Cross-repressive interactions between class I and class II proteins appear to refine and maintain these progenitor domains. The combinatorial expression of three of these proteins--Nkx6.1, Nkx2.2, and Irx3--specifies the identity of three classes of neurons generated in the ventral third of the neural tube."

https://openalex.org/W2025713422,"Cytochrome c released from mitochondria has been proposed to be an essential component of an apoptotic pathway responsive to DNA damage and other forms of cell stress. Murine embryos devoid of cytochrome c die in utero by midgestation, but cell lines established from early cytochrome c null embryos are viable under conditions that compensate for defective oxidative phosphorylation. As compared to cell lines established from wild-type embryos, cells lacking cytochrome c show reduced caspase-3 activation and are resistant to the proapoptotic effects of UV irradiation, serum withdrawal, or staurosporine. In contrast, cells lacking cytochrome c demonstrate increased sensitivity to cell death signals triggered by TNFα. These results define the role of cytochrome c in different apoptotic signaling cascades."
https://openalex.org/W2119542456,"Membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1) was recently cloned, and we now report its biochemical characterization. MT-SP1 is predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein with an extracellular protease domain. This localization was experimentally verified using immunofluorescent microscopy and a cell-surface biotinylation technique. The substrate specificity of MT-SP1 was determined using a positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library and substrate phage techniques. The preferred cleavage sequences were found to be (P4-(Arg/Lys)P3-(X)P2-(Ser)P1-(Arg)P1′-(Ala)) and (P4-(X)P3-(Arg/Lys)P2-(Ser)P1(Arg) P1′(Ala)), whereX is a non-basic amino acid. Protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator are proteins that are localized to the extracellular surface and contain the preferred MT-SP1 cleavage sequence. The ability of MT-SP1 to activate PARs was assessed by exposing PAR-expressingXenopus oocytes to the soluble MT-SP1 protease domain. The latter triggered calcium signaling in PAR2-expressing oocytes at 10 nm but failed to trigger calcium signaling in oocytes expressing PAR1, PAR3, or PAR4 at 100 nm. Single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator was activated using catalytic amounts of MT-SP1 (1 nm), but plasminogen was not cleaved under similar conditions. The membrane localization of MT-SP1 and its affinity for these key extracellular substrates suggests a role of the proteolytic activity in regulatory events. Membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1) was recently cloned, and we now report its biochemical characterization.

The membrane localization of MT-SP1 and its affinity for these key extracellular substrates suggests a role of the proteolytic activity in regulatory events. membrane-type serine protease 1 single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator protease-activated receptor positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library phosphate-buffered saline peptide N-glycosidase 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin We recently reported the cloning and initial characterization of membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1)1 from the PC-3 human prostatic cancer cell line (1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Northern blotting showed that MT-SP1 was strongly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and the prostate, whereas lower expression levels were observed in the kidney, liver, lung, and spleen. The function of MT-SP1 and its possible role in pathological states are still undetermined. However, potent macromolecular inhibitors of MT-SP1 have been identified, and reagent quantities of a His-tagged fusion of the MT-SP1 protease domain were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and autoactivated (1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the catalytic domain of MT-SP1 may provide insight regarding its physiological role. MT-SP1 is predicted to be a modular, type II transmembrane protein that contains a signal/anchor domain, two complement factor 1R-urchin embryonic growth factor-bone morphogenetic protein domains, four low density lipoprotein receptor repeats, and a serine protease domain (1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mouse homolog of MT-SP1, called epithin, recently was reported to be strongly expressed in fetal thymic stromal cells and highly expressed in a thymic epithelial nurse cell line (2Kim M.G. Chen C. Lyu M.S. Cho E.-G. Park D. Kozak C. Schwartz R.H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Another report describes the N-terminal sequencing of a protein called matriptase from human breast milk (3Lin C.-Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The reported matriptase sequence is included in the translated sequence for the cDNA of MT-SP1. The matriptase cDNA reported appears to be a partial MT-SP1 cDNA, lacking 516 of the coding nucleotides. However, since the matriptase cDNA encodes a possible initiating methionine, alternative splicing could yield a protein lacking the N-terminal region of MT-SP1. Although MT-SP1 and epithin are predicted to be type II transmembrane proteins, the reported matriptase cDNA lacks the 5′ end of the MT-SP1 cDNA and therefore the translated sequence lacks the signal/anchor domain, leading to a predicted secreted protein. Determining the cellular localization of the protein could help resolve this discrepancy and may also provide clues for understanding the function of the protein. For example, another structurally similar membrane-type serine protease, enteropeptidase, is involved in a proteolytic cascade by which activation of trypsinogen leads to activation of other digestive proteases (4Huber R. Bode W. Acc. Chem. Res. 1978; 11: 114-122Crossref Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The membrane localization is essential to restrict the activation of trypsinogen to the enterocytes of the proximal small intestine. Since MT-SP1 is also predicted to be a membrane-type protease, localization to the membrane may be essential to the proper function of the enzyme. The localization of MT-SP1 is addressed in this work using immunofluorescent localization, immunoblot analysis, and cell-surface biotinylation experiments. Further understanding of the role of MT-SP1 may be obtained by characterizing the activity of the protease domain. Reagent quantities of a His-tagged fusion of the MT-SP1 protease domain were expressed inE. coli, purified, and autoactivated, allowing determination of MT-SP1 substrate specificity. Synthetic substrates are typically used to determine the specificity of proteases. However, the use of single substrates can be tedious for synthetic peptide substrates that contain multiple amino acid residues; the exhaustive analysis of each substrate for all combinations of amino acids at multiple positions rapidly becomes impractical. By using pools of substrates through combinatorial techniques, rapid determination of the full specificity profile for an enzyme can be obtained. Two methods have been employed to determine the substrate specificity of the MT-SP1 protease domain as follows: positional scanning synthetic combinatorial libraries (PS-SCL) (5Pinilla C. Appel J.R.

However, the synthetic strategy used to make the P1-Asp library is not generalizable to all amino acids. However, a strategy allowing diversity at P1 has been achieved through nucleophilic displacement of the peptide library from the solid support by condensation with a fluorogenic 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC)-derivatized amino acid (12Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This strategy was used to create a PS-SCL library with the general structure Ac-X-X-X-Lys-AMC (12Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and can be applied to enzymes such as MT-SP1 that have basic P1 specificity. Since PS-SCL cannot be used to determine the specificity C-terminal to the scissile bond (prime side, P1′,P2′, … ,Pn′) due to the requirement of the AMC in the P1′ position, substrate phage display was utilized (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 9Matthews D.J. Wells J.A.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1197-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). An inexpensive, accessible phage display technique utilizes a cleavable peptide sequence that is inserted between a histidine tag affinity anchor and the M13 phage coat protein, pIII. Bacteriophage containing preferred peptide recognition sequences for a given protease are cleaved from the resin, recovered, and amplified, whereas uncleaved phage remain bound to the Ni(II) resin. After several rounds of cleavage and subsequent amplification of the phage, the phagemid DNA plasmids can be sequenced and analyzed for protease substrate specificity preferences (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Together, these techniques allowed the determination of the extended substrate specificity of MT-SP1; this specificity was used to identify protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) and single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (sc-uPA) as macromolecular substrates of MT-SP1. PAR2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and in a variety of epithelial cells and may function in inflammation, cytoprotection, and/or cell adhesion (13Kong W. McConalogue K. Khitin L.M.

J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1441) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study raises potential biological and pathological consequences of MT-SP1 activity. All primers used were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 391 DNA synthesizer. All restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Automated DNA sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems 377 Prism sequencer, and manual, chain termination, DNA sequencing was carried out under standard conditions. Deglycosylation was performed using PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). All other reagents were of the highest quality available and purchased from Sigma or Fisher unless otherwise noted. Polyclonal antiserum against purified His-MT-SP1 protease domain was raised in rabbits (Covance Corp., Richmond, CA). This antiserum was further purified by binding and elution from an antigen column, which had the His tag fusion of the inactive Ser-805→ Ala MT-SP1 protease domain covalently linked to the column usingN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Unal A. Pray T.R. Lagunoff M. Pennington M.W. Ganem D. Craik C.S. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7030-7038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-bound protein bands were detected using a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PC-3 (CRL-1435) and HeLa S3 (CCL-2.2) cell lines were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown according to the instructions provided by ATCC. The cells were plated on glass coverslips and were stained as described previously (20Weis K. Dingwall C. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7120-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Permeabilization was performed with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Non-permeabilized cells were treated with PBS. The primary antibody was either affinity-purified anti-MTSP1 at 1:500 dilution, monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody at 1:500 dilution, or an anti-vimentin antibody at 1:100 dilution in 5% goat serum. The appropriate biotinylated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used at 1:1000 dilution in 5% goat serum. Subsequently, the cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptavidin at 1:500 dilution in 5% goat serum. Coverslips were mounted using Gel Mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and samples were imaged using an Olympus BX60 fluorescent microscope. Each of the antibody incubation steps were for an hour with three 5-min PBS washes in between each antibody incubation. Cell lysates were prepared using PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA. The cell-impermeable sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) was used to biotinylate surface proteins as described earlier (21Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 382-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Greater than 95% of the cells remained impermeable as assayed by the impermeability of the cells to trypan blue. Cell lysates were prepared using PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EDTA. Biotinylated proteins were captured using streptavidin-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described above. No MT-SP1 was observed in the non-biotinylated PC-3 extracts. The detailed synthesis and characterization of the combinatorial library used in this study are described elsewhere (12Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Leonetti F. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Three support-bound sub-libraries were prepared (P2, P3, and P4) employing an alkane sulfonamide linker (22Backes B.J. Ellman J.A. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 2322-2330Crossref Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and solid-phase peptide synthesis. Each sub-library consisted of 19 resins (one unnatural amino acid, norleucine, was included, but cysteine and methionine were excluded) for which a single position was spatially addressed by the coupling of a single amino acid. The two remaining positions of each resin were supplied by the coupling of isokinetic mixtures of amino acid derivatives (23Ostresh J.M. Winkle J.H. Hamashin V.T. Houghten R.A. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to give a resin-bound mixture of 361 different peptides. The 57 resins comprising the entire PS-SCL were put into individual wells and cleaved from the resin with a lysine-coumarin derivative. Filtration, side chain deprotection, and concentration provided a PS-SCL of 57 wells containing 361 tetrapeptide-coumarin derivatives per well for a total of 6,859 peptide substrates per library. The concentration of MT-SP1 was determined by active-site titration as described earlier (1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Substrates from the PS-SCL were dissolved in Me2SO. Approximately 2.5 × 10−9 mol of each sub-library (361 compounds) were added to 57 wells of a 96-well Microfluor White “U” bottom plate (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Final substrate concentration was approximately 0.25 μm, making the hydrolysis of the AMC group directly proportional to the specificity constant,k cat/K m . Hydrolysis reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme (1 nm) and monitored fluorometrically with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrometer 96-well plate reader, with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. Assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Me2SO (from substrates), and 0.01% Tween 20. The phagemid pHisX3P3, derived from pBS, was used as described previously (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the biased library, the cleavage sequence was based upon the consensus sequence derived from the PS-SCL library results (X-(Arg/Gln/Lys)-(Ser/Ala/Gly)-Arg-XX), whereX can encode any amino acid in the P4 position; P3 encodes at least arginine, glutamine, and lysine; P2 encodes at least serine, alanine, and glycine; P1 is fixed as arginine; and both P1′ and P2′ are completely randomized. In the unbiased library, the randomized peptide sequence encoded in the vector is XXXRX, whereX can encode any amino acid. In this cleavage sequence, P1 is fixed as arginine, and P4–P2 and P1′ are randomized. The degenerate oligonucleotides synthesized to create the library contained the following randomized sequences (where N indicates equimolar concentrations of A, C, G, and T; S indicates equimolar concentrations of G and C; M indicates equimolar mixtures of A and C; R indicates equimolar mixtures of A and G; and K indicates equimolar mixtures of G and T): NNS MRG KSS AGG NNS NNS (biased library) and NNS NNS NNS AGA (unbiased library). The phage library and phagemid vector were constructed by ligation into the cut pHisX3P3 vector followed by electroporation of the ligated vector into XL2-Blue MRF′ cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described earlier (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In the biased library, the transformation efficiency was 2.4 × 107individual clones, and the transformation efficiency of the unbiased library was 2.1 × 107 individual clones, allowing for >99% completeness of each library. Two hundred microliters of nickel(II)-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) was washed with 10 ml of activity buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Phage particles (109) were added to the washed Ni(II) resin and bound with gentle agitation for 1 h. The Ni(II) resin subsequently was washed with 5 ml of activity buffer and gently agitated for 30 min. This washing step was repeated for a total of four 30-min washes. The activity buffer was removed, and the bound phage were eluted twice with 0.5 ml of activity buffer containing 0.5 m imidazole. The imidazole was removed using a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting solution was concentrated to a volume of 0.5 ml using a Centricon-100 filter concentrator (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The phage then were cleaved with 1 nm recombinant MT-SP1 protease domain for 1 h at 37 °C. A control sample lacking MT-SP1 was used to monitor binding of uncleaved phage to the Ni(II) resin. The cleaved phage were added to 200 μl of washed Ni(II) resin to rebind uncut phage and allowed to bind for 3 h. Phage that are cleaved by MT-SP1 lack the His tag and will not bind to Ni(II) resin. These unbound phage were eluted and amplified as described earlier (8Harris J.L. Peterson E.P. Hudig D. Thornberry N.A. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27364-27373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the cleavage round was repeated. Five rounds of panning were completed with the biased library before sequencing, and eight rounds of panning were performed for the unbiased library. All modeling was performed using the Biopolymer and Homology modules within Insight II (Molecular Simulations, San Diego). The MT-SP1 amino acids were threaded onto the β-tryptase crystal structure (24Pereira P.J. Bergner A. Macedo-Ribeiro S. Huber R. Matschiner G. Fritz H. Sommerhoff C.P. Bode W. Nature. 1998; 392: 306-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) (Protein Database code 1AOL). A model of an inhibitor bound MT-SP1 structure was produced by using a trypsin-ecotin crystal structure (25McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J.

The active-site protease binding loop of ecotin was used as a model of a substrate binding to the MT-SP1 active site. The preferred side chain rotamers of the modeled substrate were explored manually to maximize interaction with the MT-SP1 active site. cDNAs encoding hPAR1, mPAR2, hPAR3, and hPAR4 tagged with a FLAG epitope were used (26Vu T.-K.H.

At specified intervals, an aliquot was withdrawn and split into two portions. The first portion was assayed for activity against Spectrozyme UK (carbobenzoxy-l-γ-glutamyl(α-t-butoxy)-glycyl-arginine-p-nitroanilide; American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), and the second portion was boiled in sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunoblots were prepared as described above for anti-MT-SP1 immunoblots, except that polyclonal rabbit anti-human uPA antibodies (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) were used as the primary antibody. MT-SP1 is predicted to be a 95-kDa protein, and upon activation of the protease domain, a disulfide link is predicted to tether the catalytic domain to the non-catalytic domains (Fig.1 A). Under non-reducing conditions, immunoblotting of Triton extracts derived from PC-3 cells shows a doublet at approximately 80 kDa (Fig. 1 B, 4th lane) using polyclonal antibodies directed against the soluble, recombinant MT-SP1 protease domain (Fig. 1, A and B, 1st lane). Under reducing conditions, the predicted disulfide linkage between the catalytic and non-catalytic domain should be severed, resulting in release of the proteolytic domain. Indeed a band at 87 kDa and a band at 29 kDa are observed (Fig. 1 B, 3rd and5th lanes). Upon deglycosylation of the PC-3 Triton extract with PNGase F, only a single band is observed at 85 kDa, and the band attributed to the protease domain decreases to the size of the recombinant MT-SP1 (Fig. 1 B, 6th lane). This proposed glycosylation is consistent with the predicted N-linked glycosylation sites in the pro-domain (residues 109, 302, and 485) and the protease domain (residue 771) (see Ref. 1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The band at 85 kDa is smaller than the predicted 95 kDa of the full-length protein. This decrease in size may be due to significant folding of the protease even under reducing conditions with SDS. This decrease in size appears more pronounced under non-reducing conditions in the presence of SDS (Fig.1 B, 4th lane), where the protease domain appears to be only 80 kDa in size. In vitro transcription-translation of full-length MT-SP1 cDNA results in a band at 85 kDa (Fig. 1 B, 7th lane), which is the same size as the deglycosylated MT-SP1 (Fig. 1 B, 6th lane), supporting the hypothesis that the full-length protein runs smaller than the predicted molecular weight. The absence of the band at 29 kDa in this sample is presumably due to the reducing environment in the in vitrotranscription/translation mixture, which likely prevents proper folding and activation of the protease. MT-SP1 is predicted to be an integral membrane protein localized to the extracellular surface through a signal/anchor domain (1Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The extracellular surface localization of MT-SP1 was verified using two independent techniques, biotinylation of cell-surface proteins and immunofluorescence. Cell-surface localization was determined by biotinylating cell-surface proteins using a non-permeable biotinylation reagent (21Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Anal.

https://openalex.org/W2149594557,"To elucidate the structural determinants governing specificity in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, we have determined the crystal structures of FGF1 and FGF2 complexed with the ligand binding domains (immunoglobulin-like domains 2 [D2] and 3 [D3]) of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGFR2, respectively. Highly conserved FGF-D2 and FGF-linker (between D2-D3) interfaces define a general binding site for all FGF-FGFR complexes. Specificity is achieved through interactions between the N-terminal and central regions of FGFs and two loop regions in D3 that are subject to alternative splicing. These structures provide a molecular basis for FGF1 as a universal FGFR ligand and for modulation of FGF-FGFR specificity through primary sequence variations and alternative splicing."

We demonstrate that several type III effectors from Pseudomonas syringae are targeted to the host plasma membrane and that efficient membrane association enhances function. Efficient localization of three Avr proteins requires consensus myristoylation sites, and Avr proteins can be myristoylated inside the host cell. These prokaryotic type III effectors thus utilize a eukaryote-specific posttranslational modification to access the subcellular compartment where they function."

Here, we report that a Drosophila PAR-1 homolog localizes to the posterior of the oocyte with oskar mRNA. Furthermore, par-1 mutants show a novel polarity phenotype in which bicoid mRNA accumulates normally at the anterior, but oskar mRNA is redirected to the center of the oocyte, resulting in embryonic patterning defects. These phenotypes arise from a disorganization of the oocyte microtubule cytoskeleton, consistent with reports that mammalian PAR-1 homologs regulate microtubule dynamics. Thus, Drosophila PAR-1 may remodel the oocyte microtubule network to define the posterior as the site for oskar localization.

The p27Kip1 protein has now been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo, and this phosphorylation reduces the electrophoretic mobility of the protein. Substitution of Ser10 with Ala (S10A) markedly reduced the extent of p27Kip1 phosphorylation and prevented the shift in electrophoretic mobility. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation at Ser10 accounted for ∼70% of the total phosphorylation of p27Kip1, and the extent of phosphorylation at this site was ∼25- and 75-fold greater than that at Ser178 and Thr187, respectively. The phosphorylation of p27Kip1 was markedly reduced when the positions of Ser10 and Pro11 were reversed, suggesting that a proline-directed kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation of Ser10. The extent of Ser10phosphorylation was markedly increased in cells in the G0-G1 phase of the cell cycle compared with that apparent for cells in S or M phase. The p27Kip1 protein phosphorylated at Ser10 was significantly more stable than the unphosphorylated form.

Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar,2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). The interaction of CKIs with cyclin·CDK complexes is triggered by a variety of antimitogenic signals and results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the complexes and consequent restraint of cell cycle progression. CKIs are classified into two families on the basis of their amino acid sequence similarity and putative targets (3Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Sherr J.C. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). The Cip or Kip family comprises p21Cip1 (also known as Waf1, Sdi1, and CAP20), p27Kip1, and p57Kip2, each of which possesses a conserved domain, termed the CDK-binding inhibitory domain, at its NH2 terminus. The Ink4 family consists of p16Ink4A, p15Ink4B, p18Ink4C, and p19Ink4D, and its members each contain four tandem repeats of an ankyrin motif. Whereas members of the Ink4 family inhibit the activity of CDK4 or CDK6 specifically, members of the Cip-Kip family show a broad spectrum of inhibitory effects on cyclin·CDK complexes.The p27Kip1 protein plays a pivotal role in the control of cell proliferation (5Polyak K.

Transition from G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle is promoted by G1 cyclin·CDK complexes, and p27Kip1 inhibits the activities of these complexes directly by binding to them. In normal cells, the amount of p27Kip1 is high during G0-G1 phase, but it rapidly decreases on reentry into S phase triggered by specific mitogenic factors (7Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S.

Such may also be the case with p27Kip1, given that its down-regulation is promoted by its phosphorylation on Thr187 by the cyclin E·CDK2 complex (22Vlach J. Hennecke S. Amati B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5334-5344Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 23Sheaff R.J. Groudine M. Gordon M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

Recent data have also suggested that Fbl1 (also known as Skp2), an F-box protein that is thought to function as the receptor component of an SCF(Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, binds to p27Kip1 only when Thr187 is phosphorylated; such binding then results in the ubiquitination and degradation of p27Kip1 (25Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 26Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar).Various kinases, such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and CDKs, may trigger the degradation of p27Kip1 in response to different upstream signaling pathways. For example, activation of members of the MAPK family is mediated through Ras (28Kawada M. Yamagoe S. Murakami Y. Suzuki K. Mizuno S. Uehara Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 629-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), whereas rapid activation of cyclin E-CDK2 results from the induction of Myc (29Muller D. Bouchard C. Rudolph B. Steiner P.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus also destabilizes p27Kip1through phosphorylation of Thr187 by the complex of the virus cyclin (K-cyclin) and CDK6 (31Mann D.J. Child E.S. Swanton C. Laman H. Jones N.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that phosphorylation of p27Kip1 controls its stability. However, because most studies have focused on the role of phosphorylation of Thr187 in p27Kip1 stability, little is known about the potential roles of other phosphorylation sites of this protein.We now show that p27Kip1 is phosphorylated on many sites, including Thr187, in vivo, with the predominant phosphorylation site being Ser10. Phosphorylation of Ser10 is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and may function to stabilize p27Kip1. Given that the level of phosphorylation of Ser10 is substantially greater than that apparent at other phosphorylation sites, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10 may be critical for regulation of cell cycle progression from the resting state to proliferation.DISCUSSIONRegulation of the cell cycle at the G1-S boundary is thought to be important for the control of cell proliferation. Kinase activity associated with two G1 cyclins, cyclins D and E, is essential for this transition, predominantly because of the requirement for phosphorylation of Rb and the consequent termination of its inhibition of cell cycle progression (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar, 2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). Among the mechanisms responsible for regulation of G1 cyclin-associated kinase activity, control of the abundance of p27Kip1 by external mitogenic signals appears important (3Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Sherr J.C. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). The amount of p27Kip1 is regulated predominantly by posttranslational modification, which affects protein stability, rather than by transcriptional control (14Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M.

Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 26Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation of Thr187 has been thought to be a central mechanism in control of the stability of p27Kip1 by ubiquitin-mediated degradation. However, we have now shown that the extent of phosphorylation of p27Kip1 on Thr187represents only ∼1% of the total extent of phosphorylation of this protein in vivo. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser10 accounts for ∼70% of the total extent of phosphorylation of p27Kip1. Furthermore, the extent of phosphorylation at this site is increased in resting cells, and Ser10 phosphorylation both affects protein stability and was apparent in various types of cells from several species. These data suggest that phosphorylation of Ser10 may represent another important mechanism by which the stability of p27Kip1 is regulated. It is of note that the extent of phosphorylation of Thr187 is almost certainly underestimated since this residue is phosphorylated during a limited period of the cell cycle or if p27Kip1 phosphorylated at this site is too unstable to be effectively detected by immunoblot analysis or labeling with32P. The observation that the abundance of p27Kip1is increased in cells of Fbl1-deficient mice (46Nakayama K. Nagahama H. Minamishima Y.A. Matsumoto M. Nakamichi I. Kitagawa K. Shirane M. Tsunematsu R. Tsukiyama T. Ishida N. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K.-I. Hatakeyama S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2069-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) suggests that phosphorylation of Thr187 is indeed an important determinant of this parameter. Although the degradation of p27Kip1 was slower in Fbl1-deficient cells than in wild-type cells, the observation that a substantial extent of p27Kip1degradation was still apparent in these cells 2M. Kitagawa, K. Nakayama, and K.-I. Nakayama, manuscript in preparation. is consistent with the existence of other pathways for p27Kip1 degradation.The increased stability of the Ser10-phosphorylated form of p27Kip1 (Fig. 8) and the S10E mutant, which mimics the Ser10-phosphorylated form of the protein (Figs. 9 and 10), suggests that dephosphorylation of p27Kip1 at Ser10might play an important role in progression of the cell cycle from G0-G1 to S phase. However, both the kinase and phosphatase responsible for the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser10, respectively, as well as the mechanism by which phosphorylation of Ser10 stabilizes p27Kip1, remain to be identified. It will also be important to determine whether such regulation of p27Kip1 stability is linked to external mitogenic signals. The stability of the protein IκBα is regulated by two independent mechanisms as follows: phosphorylation at sites near the NH2 terminus, which is induced by external signals, and phosphorylation at sites near the COOH terminus, which controls the basal turnover rate (47Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). The signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBα results in its targeting by the F-box protein Fbw1 (also known as FWD1 or β-TrCP) and its consequent ubiquitination-dependent degradation (20Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The stability of p27Kip1 thus might also be subjected to dual regulation by signal-induced phosphorylation at Thr187, which recruits the F-box protein Fbl1 and results in ubiquitination-dependent degradation, and by phosphorylation at Ser10.The biochemical activity of p27Kip1 suggests that the protein functions as a tumor suppressor. Indeed, mice lacking p27Kip1are prone to spontaneous tumorigenesis (10Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y. Nakayama K..

Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) showed that tumors with low levels of p27Kip1 expression exhibited relatively high rates of p27Kip1 degradation (and vice versa). It is unlikely that this increased degradation of p27Kip1 was due to nonspecific enhancement of general protein degradation, because degradation of neither p21Cip1 nor cyclin A was affected in the same cancer patients. The mechanisms that control the stability of p27Kip1thus appear important in cancer development. Characterization of these mechanisms should shed light on fundamental issues such as how cell cycle regulation is linked to developmental control and how the disturbance of cell cycle regulation results in carcinogenesis (and may lead to the development of anti-cancer drugs with new modes of action). Progression of the cell cycle in all eukaryotic cells depends on the activity of a series of kinase complexes composed of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).1 The activity of cyclin·CDK complexes is regulated by various mechanisms, including association of the kinase subunit with the regulatory cyclin subunit, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the kinase subunit, and association of the complex with a group of CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (1Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2923) Google Scholar,2Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4945) Google Scholar). The interaction of CKIs with cyclin·CDK complexes is triggered by a variety of antimitogenic signals and results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the complexes and consequent restraint of cell cycle progression. CKIs are classified into two families on the basis of their amino acid sequence similarity and putative targets (3Nakayama K.-I. Nakayama K. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 4Sherr J.C. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5097) Google Scholar). The Cip or Kip family comprises p21Cip1 (also known as Waf1, Sdi1, and CAP20), p27Kip1, and p57Kip2, each of which possesses a conserved domain, termed the CDK-binding inhibitory domain, at its NH2 terminus. The Ink4 family consists of p16Ink4A, p15Ink4B, p18Ink4C, and p19Ink4D, and its members each contain four tandem repeats of an ankyrin motif. Whereas members of the Ink4 family inhibit the activity of CDK4 or CDK6 specifically, members of the Cip-Kip family show a broad spectrum of inhibitory effects on cyclin·CDK complexes. The p27Kip1 protein plays a pivotal role in the control of cell proliferation (5Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar, 6Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar). Transition from G1 phase to S phase of the cell cycle is promoted by G1 cyclin·CDK complexes, and p27Kip1 inhibits the activities of these complexes directly by binding to them. In normal cells, the amount of p27Kip1 is high during G0-G1 phase, but it rapidly decreases on reentry into S phase triggered by specific mitogenic factors (7Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Forced expression of p27Kip1 results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase (5Polyak K. Lee M.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J. Cell. 1994; 78: 59-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar, 6Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar), and conversely, inhibition of p27Kip1 expression by antisense oligonucleotides increases the number of cells in S phase (9Coats S. Flanagan W.M. Nourse J. Roberts J.M. Science. 1996; 272: 877-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Moreover, mice with a homozygous deletion of the p27Kip1 gene are larger than normal mice and exhibit multiple organ hyperplasia and a predisposition to spontaneous and radiation- or chemical-induced tumors (10Nakayama K.

We show that the N-terminal domain of Tim23 is exposed on the surface of the outer membrane. The two-membrane–spanning topology of Tim23 is a novel characteristic in membrane biology. By the simultaneous integration into two membranes, Tim23 forms contacts between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Tethering the inner membrane translocase to the outer membrane facilitates the transfer of precursor proteins from the TOM complex to the TIM23 complex and increases the efficiency of protein import."

https://openalex.org/W2155895966,"We have determined the crystal structure of the ligand binding fragment of the neural cell adhesion molecule axonin-1/TAG-1 comprising the first four immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. The overall structure of axonin-1(Ig1-4) is U-shaped due to contacts between domains 1 and 4 and domains 2 and 3. In the crystals, these molecules are aligned in a string with adjacent molecules oriented in an anti-parallel fashion and their C termini perpendicular to the string. This arrangement suggests that cell adhesion by homophilic axonin-1 interaction occurs by the formation of a linear zipper-like array in which the axonin-1 molecules are alternately provided by the two apposed membranes. In accordance with this model, mutations in a loop critical for the formation of the zipper resulted in the loss of the homophilic binding capacity of axonin-1."

https://openalex.org/W2125023500,"von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that is required for normal hemostasis. After translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, proVWF subunits dimerize through disulfide bonds between their C-terminal cystine knot-like (CK) domains. CK domains are characterized by six conserved cysteines. Disulfide bonds between cysteines 2 and 5 and between cysteines 3 and 6 define a ring that is penetrated by a disulfide bond between cysteines 1 and 4. Dimerization often is mediated by additional cysteines that differ among CK domain subfamilies. When expressed in a baculovirus system, recombinant VWF CK domains (residues 1957-2050) were secreted as dimers that were converted to monomers by selective reduction and alkylation of three unconserved cysteine residues: Cys(2008), Cys(2010), and Cys(2048). By partial reduction and alkylation, chemical and proteolytic digestion, mass spectrometry, and amino acid sequencing, the remaining intrachain disulfide bonds were characterized: Cys(1961)-Cys(2011) (), Cys(1987)-Cys(2041) (), Cys(1991)-Cys(2043) (), and Cys(1976)-Cys(2025). The mutation C2008A or C2010A prevented dimerization, whereas the mutation C2048A did not. Symmetry considerations and molecular modeling based on the structure of transforming growth factor-beta suggest that one or three of residues Cys(2008), Cys(2010), and Cys(2048) in each subunit mediate the covalent dimerization of proVWF."

The high degree of identity (>90%) between the two human ClC-K isoforms makes a correlation with the corresponding mouse and rat counterparts difficult. ClC-K genes were also cloned from rabbit (ocClC-Ka) (5Zimniak L. Winters C.J. Reeves W.B. Andreoli T.E. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1828-1836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Xenopus(xClC-K) (6Maulet Y. Lambert R.C. Mykita S. Mouton J. Partisani M. Bailly Y. Bombarde G. Feltz A. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 737-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the expression of rClC-K1 protein may be confined to the ascending thin limb of Henle's loop (7Uchida S. Sasaki S. Nitta K. Uchida K. Horita S. Nihei H. Marumo F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), rClC-K2 appears to be expressed in several nephron segments. Depending on the antibodies used, several studies differ somewhat as to the localization to different nephron segments. A common finding, however, is the expression of rClC-K2 (and ocClC-Ka) at the basolateral side of the thick ascending limb and other more distally located nephron segments (8Vandewalle A. Cluzeaud F. Bens M. Kieferle S. Steinmeyer K. Jentsch T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F678-F688PubMed Google Scholar, 9Winters C.J. Zimniak L. Reeves W.B. Andreoli T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F1030-F1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the ascending thin limb, these nephron segments are the main site of transcellular chloride reabsorption. They reabsorb about 30% of the chloride that is filtered at the glomeruli and thereby play an important role in the maintenance of body salt and fluid balance. The expression pattern suggests that ClC-K proteins are involved in transcellular chloride transport. This notion is strongly supported by two genetic findings. First, disruption of theCLCNK1 gene (coding for ClC-K1) in mice induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (10Matsumura Y. Uchida S. Kondo Y. Miyazaki H. Ko S.B.H. Hayama A. Morimoto T. Liu W. Arisawa M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This is presumably due to a urinary concentration defect caused by a reduced medullary salt concentration. Second, mutations in the hClC-Kb gene (CLCNKB) are associated with Bartter's syndrome (11Simon D.B. Bindra R.S. Mansfield T.A. Nelson-Williams C. Mendonca E. Stone R. Schurman S. Nayir A. Alpay H. Bakkaloglu A. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Morales J.M. Sanjad S.A. Taylor C.M. Pilz D. Brem A. Trachtman H. Griswold W. Richard G.A. John E. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). This autosomal recessive salt-wasting disorder is characterized by a reduced sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb. This puts hClC-Kb into a functional relationship with the apical NaK2Cl cotransporter and with the ROMK potassium channel, whose inactivation causes other variants of Bartter's syndrome (12Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Hamdan J.M. Di Pietro A. Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 13Simon D.B. Karet F.E. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Hamdan J.H. DiPietro A. Trachtman H. Sanjad S.A. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). These findings are compatible with a transport model in which chloride is taken up apically by the cotransporter (the potassium is recycled over the apical membrane by ROMK) and then leaves the cell at the basolateral membrane via hClC-Kb channels. The different phenotypes observed upon mutations in mClC-K1 and hClC-Kb may indicate that mClC-K1 is the homologue of hClC-Ka rather than of hClC-Kb. Both phenotypes may be explained by a loss of plasma membrane chloride transport. However, heterologous expression of ClC-K proteins yielded controversial results. Uchida et al. reported that expression of rat ClC-K1 in Xenopus oocytes induced outwardly rectifying chloride currents that resembled those observed in the ascending thin limb (7Uchida S. Sasaki S. Nitta K. Uchida K. Horita S. Nihei H. Marumo F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These currents are inhibited by acidic extracellular pH or by reducing the extracellular calcium concentration, and have an anion conductivity sequence of Br− > Cl− > I− (4Adachi S. Uchida S. Ito H. Hata M. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although initially we could not reproduce these results (2Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), with an optimized vector we now succeeded in expressing rClC-K1 with similar properties. However, with the same expression vector we could not detect currents upon expression of rClC-K2, hClC-Ka, and hClC-Kb. This is in contrast to findings from Adachi et al., who reported currents with kinetics similar to rClC-K1 after expression of rClC-K2 (4Adachi S. Uchida S. Ito H. Hata M. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, they observed identical currents with a rClC-K2 splice variant that completely lacked the second transmembrane domain (4Adachi S. Uchida S. Ito H. Hata M. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This could argue for the induction of an anion conductance endogenous toXenopus oocytes. We performed the present study with two major aims. First, we aimed to prove that rClC-K1 functions as a plasma membrane chloride channel by inserting a point mutation that changes its intrinsic channel properties. Second, by constructing chimeras between these highly related proteins, we wanted to find out which protein regions are necessary for functional expression inXenopus oocytes. We generated a chimeric channel that consisted largely of hClC-Kb and showed interesting differences in channel properties. Insertion of CLCNKB mutations found in human Bartter's syndrome abolished or strongly reduced these currents. This suggests that Bartter's syndrome III is due to the loss of a chloride current with characteristics that differ from those of ClC-K1 currents. rClC-K1 and rClC-K2 as well as hClC-Ka and hClC-Kb (2Kieferle S. Fong P. Bens M. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6943-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) were cloned into pTLN (14Lorenz C. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13362-13366Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), a vector that containsXenopus globin untranslated sequences and is optimized for protein expression in Xenopus oocytes. Single point mutations were introduced by recombinant polymerase chain reaction. To construct chimeras between hClC-Kb and rClC-K1, rClC-K1 cDNA segments were amplified with chimeric oligonucleotides that contained terminal overhangs corresponding to the respective hClC-Kb sequences. Two flanking hClC-Kb sequences were amplified in separate reactions. These three amplification products were joined by a single recombinant polymerase chain reaction, digested with appropriate restriction endonucleases, and ligated into the cut hClC-Kb/pTLN construct. All polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments were entirely sequenced. SP6 polymerase (mMessage mMachine kit; Ambion) was used for in vitro transcription of capped cRNA after linearization of the constructs with MluI. 10 ng of cRNA was injected in defolliculated oocytes. Oocytes were kept at 17 °C in ND96 solution containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and gentamycin (20 μg/ml). 2–3 days after injection, two-electrode voltage clamp measurements were performed at room temperature with a Turbotec 05 amplifier (NPI Instruments) and pClamp 5.5 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were recorded in ND96 solution (without gentamycin). For anion replacement experiments, 80 mm chloride was substituted by equivalent amounts of bromide, iodide, or nitrate. Anion permeability ratios were calculated using the modified Goldmann equation,P(anion)/P(chloride)=(104×e40×(E1−E2)−24)/80Equation 1 where E1 and E2 correspond to the reversal potentials (in volts) before and after substitution of 80 mm chloride by the indicated anions, respectively. The relative anion conductance sequences were determined from the current amplitudes at +60 mV in the presence of ND96 or after replacement of 80 mm chloride by the respective anions. Statistic values are presented as mean ± S.E. (n represents the number of experiments). When using different pH values, 5 mm HEPES (for pH 7.0 and 7.5) was replaced by 5 mmMES1 (for pH 5.0–6.5) or 5 mm TRIS (pH 8.0). Extracellular divalent cation concentration was varied by adding calcium acetate or magnesium acetate to the ND96 solution. A membrane-impermeable NH2-reactive biotin ester (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-biotin; Pierce) was used to label plasma membrane proteins of Xenopus oocytes expressing ClC-K constructs. Oocytes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in ND96 with a 0.5 mg/ml concentration of the biotin ester. After several washes in ice-cold ND96, the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Insoluble material was separated by centrifugation, and the clear supernatant was precipitated with streptavidin beads (Pierce). The precipitate was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For Western blot analysis, we used a rat monoclonal antibody (3F10; 200 ng/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) directed against an HA epitope we had added to the amino terminus of the ClC-K constructs. Primary and secondary (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, 1:10,000) antibodies were diluted in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20. Reacting proteins were detected with the Renaissance reagent (NEN Life Science Products) and photographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). We cloned the rClC-K1 cDNA into an optimized expression vector containing the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theXenopus β-globin gene. Two to three days after injecting cRNA derived from this construct into Xenopus oocytes, two-electrode voltage clamp measurements revealed nearly instantaneous, slightly outwardly rectifying currents. They showed some time-dependent gating at voltages more positive than +40 mV or more negative than −100 mV (Fig.1 A). Partial replacement of extracellular chloride by other anions indicated a Br− > NO3− ≥ Cl− > I− conductance sequence (Fig. 1 B). Reversal potential measurements upon substitution of 80 mmol/liter Cl− with different anions revealed an anion permeability sequence of Cl− > Br− > NO3− > I− (TableI). The current amplitude increased upon extracellular alkalinization to pH 8.0 and strongly decreased when the extracellular pH was reduced from pH 7.5 to pH 6.5 (Fig.1 C). These properties were similar to those previously reported by Uchida et al. (7Uchida S. Sasaki S. Nitta K. Uchida K. Horita S. Nihei H. Marumo F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Again similar to that study, current amplitudes were rather low (∼1 μA at +60 mV) and thus difficult to discriminate from endogenous oocyte chloride currents. Although these endogenous currents display an I− > Cl− conductance and are not sensitive to ambient pH changes, we sought more definitive evidence that the current seen upon rClC-K1 expression is directly due to the heterologously expressed protein.Table IAnion permeability (P) ratios of ClC-K1 and chimeric ClC-K constructsP (Br−)/P(Cl−)P (NO−3)/P(Cl−)P (I−)/P(Cl−)ClC-K1 (n = 9)0.85 ± 0.020.47 ± 0.010.33 ± 0.04(2.6 ± 0.9 mV)(12.3 ± 0.7 mV)(17.9 ± 2.3 mV)ClC-Kb(D4)K1 (n = 5)0.71 ± 0.050.16 ± 0.030.12 ± 0.03(5.8 ± 1.7 mV)(25.9 ± 2.3 mV)(28.0 ± 2.1 mV)ClC-Kb(D5)K1 (n = 5)0.76 ± 0.040.24 ± 0.040.14 ± 0.03(5.0 ± 1.4 mV)(21.3 ± 2.4 mV)(26.1 ± 2.2 mV)ClC-K1(D2)Kb(D5)K1 (n = 5)0.90 ± 0.020.22 ± 0.030.14 ± 0.01(2.0 ± 0.4 mV)(22.4 ± 1.0 mV)(26.4 ± 1.2 mV)ClC-K1(D1)Kb(D5)K1 (n = 5)0.72 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.02(5.4 ± 1.3 mV)(28.0 ± 1.9 mV)(29.4 ± 1.5 mV)ClC-Kb(c) (n = 7)0.61 ± 0.010.05 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.01(9.7 ± 1.0 mV)(32.9 ± 2.3 mV)(25.9 ± 1.6 mV)ClC-Kb(c)(V166E) (n = 7)0.54 ± 0.010.36 ± 0.010.31 ± 0.03(10.6 ± 0.7 mV)(16.4 ± 0.7 mV)(18.6 ± 1.7 mV)Using the Goldmann equation (see “Experimental Procedures”) the ratios were calculated from reversal potential shift measurements (given in parenthesis) after substitution of 80 mm chloride with the indicated anions.

Open table in a new tab Using the Goldmann equation (see “Experimental Procedures”) the ratios were calculated from reversal potential shift measurements (given in parenthesis) after substitution of 80 mm chloride with the indicated anions. The constructs ClC-K1(D2)Kb(D5)K1 and ClC-K1(D1)Kb(D5)K1 refer to Fig. 3,A and E, respectively. Since rClC-K1-induced currents decreased upon removal of extracellular calcium (7Uchida S. Sasaki S. Nitta K. Uchida K. Horita S. Nihei H. Marumo F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), we investigated whether we could increase currents by raising the extracellular concentration of divalent cations. Whereas the addition of 5 mm magnesium or barium had no appreciable effect (data not shown), the elevation of extracellular calcium concentration from 1 to 5 mm increased current amplitudes nearly 4-fold (Fig. 1 D). This increase occurred immediately after bath fluid exchange and was rapidly reversible upon wash-out. This points to an extracellular effect of calcium. The anion conductance sequence and the pH sensitivity of rClC-K1 currents were not affected by this maneuver (data not shown). This effect clearly distinguished rClC-K1 currents from endogenous oocyte currents particularly as elevation of extracellular calcium concentration to 5 mm failed to induce an anion conductance in uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with cRNAs derived from hClC-Kb, hClC-Ka, or rClC-K2 (data not shown). To show more directly that rClC-K1 functions as a chloride channel, we sought to change key biophysical properties (like ion selectivity or gating) by a point mutation. Mutations in a highly conserved motif (GKEGP) at the end of the third transmembrane domain (D3) are known to change gating and pore properties of several CLC channels (15Steinmeyer K. Lorenz C. Pusch M. Koch M.C. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 16Fahlke C., Yu, H.T. Beck C.L. Rhodes T.H. George A.L.J.

Interestingly, the glutamate in this motif is exchanged for a hydrophobic amino acid (valine or leucine) in all known ClC-K proteins. We mutated this valine to glutamate in rClC-K1 (V166E) and thus converted this region to the GKEGP consensus sequence found in all other members of the CLC family. This mutation changed rClC-K1 gating drastically (Fig. 1 E). Instead of the rather voltage-independent gating of wild type rClC-K1, currents now activated slowly upon hyperpolarization. Additionally, measurements of tail currents in the presence of different anions revealed that the V166E mutation changed the anion conductance sequence from Br−> NO3− ≥ Cl− > I− (wild type) to Cl− > Br− > NO3− = I− (Fig.1 F). Similar to wild type currents, lowering extracellular pH decreased, and raising extracellular calcium concentration increased current amplitudes (Fig. 1, G and H). Niflumic acid (10 μm) and anthracene-9-carboxylic acid (500 μm) had no effect, whereas 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (500 μm) completely blocked currents induced by both wild type ClC-K1 and ClC-K1(V166E) (data not shown). Having demonstrated that rClC-K1 directly mediates anion currents, we expressed rClC-K2, hClC-Ka, and hClC-Kb in Xenopus oocytes, using the same efficient oocyte expression vector. In contrast to Adachi et al. (4Adachi S. Uchida S. Ito H. Hata M. Hiroe M. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17677-17683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who reported that rClC-K2 induced currents in Xenopus oocytes, we could not detect anion currents above background with any of these constructs. This is surprising, since they are roughly 90% identical to rClC-K1 (Fig.2 A). To identify protein regions that may be necessary for the functional expression of hClC-Kb, we replaced several regions of this protein with the corresponding stretches derived from rClC-K1. These constructs were named according to the sequential order of the individual components (from the N terminus to the C terminus). The region in parenthesis indicates the position where these were fused together. Thus, ClC-K1(D9)Kb denotes a chimera in which an amino-terminal rClC-K1 stretch is fused to a carboxyl-terminal hClC-Kb sequence within transmembrane domain D9 (according to the topology model published in Ref. 18Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7633-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). None of the chimeras in which amino-terminal portions of hClC-Kb were replaced with the corresponding rClC-K1 sequences induced chloride currents inXenopus oocytes (up to transmembrane region D9 (ClC-K1(D3)Kb, ClC-K1(D6)Kb, ClC-K1(D9)Kb); data not shown). By contrast, when C-terminal parts of hClC-Kb were replaced by rClC-K1 segments, we detected two different types of currents depending on the extent of the replacement. As expected, when the major part of the chimeric channel consisted of rClC-K1 (constructs ClC-Kb(D3)K1 and ClC-Kb(D4)K1), currents resembled those of rClC-K1 (Fig.2 B). This included the Br− > Cl−> I− conductance sequence and the residual voltage-dependent gating at positive voltages. Surprisingly, shifting the ClC-Kb/-K1 fusion point 43 amino acids further to the C terminus (ClC-Kb(D5)K1) yielded a new type of current (Fig. 2 C). The current amplitude increased about 10-fold, the conductance sequence was changed to Cl− > Br− > I−, and there was no obvious voltage-dependent gating even at rather positive voltages. As indicated in Table I, the permeability sequence of Cl−> Br− > NO3− ≥ I− did not change. Similar currents were observed with a successive reduction of the rClC-K1 portion with constructs ClC-Kb(D6)K1, ClC-Kb(D7)K1, ClC-Kb(D8)K1, and ClC-Kb(D9)K1 (Fig.2 D). However, current amplitudes gradually decreased in parallel to the replacement of rClC-K1 with hClC-Kb sequences (Fig.2 E). The drastic alteration in channel properties observed upon shifting the fusion point from the beginning of D4 to the beginning of D5 suggested an involvement of the D4 domain in determining anion conductivity properties and gating. To test whether the changes in channel properties are solely due to the exchange of the D4 domain, we engineered several rClC-K1 constructs in which D4 alone or together with adjacent protein regions were replaced with the corresponding hClC-Kb regions. In contrast to the expectation, exchanging the D4 domain of rClC-K1 with that of hClC-Kb, either alone (data not shown) or together with D3 and a portion of D2 (Fig.3 A), resulted in a similar anion conductance sequence (Fig. 3, B and C) or pH and calcium sensitivity (Fig. 3 D) as observed for rClC-K1. However, these properties changed after transplanting a larger hClC-Kb protein region that comprised the C-terminal part of D1 and the N-terminal part of D5 (Fig. 3 E). Besides a Cl−> Br− > I− conductance sequence (Fig. 3,F and G), this construct showed a reduced sensitivity toward extracellular acidification to pH 6.5 (Fig.3 H). In addition, the elevation of extracellular calcium concentration had only a small effect on current amplitudes (Fig.3 H). As evident from Table I, the anion permeability sequences of both constructs were nearly identical. Extending the hClC-Kb portion further toward the carboxyl terminus beyond the transmembrane block D9–D12 did not result in functional channels (data not shown). To obtain a functional construct that contained a larger portion of hClC-Kb, we replaced progressively larger parts of the ClC-Kb(D9)K1 C terminus with stretches derived from hClC-Kb. A total exchange of the intracellular C terminus, however, resulted in a construct that did not yield currents (data not shown). In contrast, a partial replacement (with the fusion point within the CBS1 domain (19Ponting C.P. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 160-163Google Scholar, 20Schmidt-Rose T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 15110-15118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)) yielded currents that resembled those of ClC-Kb(D9)K1. As we could not reduce further the contribution of rClC-K1 sequences without losing functional expression, we used this construct to further characterize channel properties. We named this construct ClC-Kb(c) (where “c” represents chimeric). Expression of ClC-Kb(c) in Xenopus oocytes gave rise to linear currents with no appreciable voltage dependence (Fig.4 A). The shift of the reversal potential of about 53 mV per decade of change of extracellular chloride concentration pointed to a selective chloride conductance (Fig. 4 B). As expected for a chloride current, the reversal potential was close to −30 mV (Fig. 4 C). Anion replacement experiments revealed a Cl− > Br− > I− > NO3− conductance sequence (Fig. 4 C). The shift in reversal potential indicated a similar permeability sequence (Table I). Comparable with rClC-K1, ClC-Kb(c)-induced currents decreased upon extracellular acidification (Fig. 4 D). With the half-maximal inhibition occurring at pH 6.3, the pH sensitivity was shifted to more acidic pH values as compared with rClC-K1. Similar to rClC-K1, the V166E mutation conferred voltage dependence on ClC-Kb(c)-induced currents (Fig.4 E). In contrast to the rClC-K1(V166E) mutation, however, these currents were activated not only at negative voltages but also in the positive voltage range and no significant tail currents could be observed (Fig. 4, E and F). Moreover, the anion conductance sequence was not affected by this mutation (Fig.4 F). An increase in extracellular calcium concentration did not change the magnitude of ClC-Kb(c) and ClC-Kb(c)(V166E)-mediated currents (data not shown). Because hClC-Kb could not be expressed functionally, it has not yet been possible to analyze the biophysical consequences ofCLCNKB mutations associated with Bartter's syndrome. We therefore introduced the point mutations that were found in patients (11Simon D.B. Bindra R.S. Mansfield T.A. Nelson-Williams C. Mendonca E. Stone R. Schurman S. Nayir A. Alpay H. Bakkaloglu A. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Morales J.M. Sanjad S.A. Taylor C.M. Pilz D. Brem A. Trachtman H. Griswold W. Richard G.A. John E. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) into the ClC-Kb(c) construct (P124L, A204T, A349D, Y432H, and R438C) and expressed these in oocytes. Invariably these mutations either strongly reduced (Y432H) or completely abolished ClC-Kb(c) currents (Fig. 5 A). In order to determine the level of expression of these proteins, they were tagged with an HA epitope at the amino terminus. After labeling the plasma membrane proteins externally with biotin, we performed Western blot analysis of total cellular lysates and of the purified biotin-labeled protein fractions. Immunodetection with an anti-HA antibody demonstrated that the mutated ClC-Kb(c) constructs were efficiently translated and transported to the plasma membrane (Fig.5 B). In addition to a band of the predicted molecular size (80 kDa), a more prominent band appeared at about 160 kDa, which may be due to a dimerization of the ClC-K proteins. As is also evident from Fig. 5 B, the HA-tagged version of the wild type hClC-Kb protein showed a similar degree of biotin labeling as the ClC-Kb(c) construct. Wild type hClC-Kb hence seemed to reach the plasma membrane. ClC-K channels have attracted considerable interest because of their importance in renal physiology. Mutations in genes encoding ClC-K channels result in Bartter's syndrome and in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Based on these findings and on the localization of the corresponding mRNAs and proteins in certain segments of the nephron, it was proposed that ClC-K channels are involved in transepithelial transport. Unfortunately, however, no functional expression could be obtained so far for the hClC-Ka and hClC-Kb channels, and data for the rClC-K1 and rClC-K2 were controversial. A correlation with channels found in situ and an investigation of the physiological consequences of mutations found in Bartter's syndrome, however, requires data on the functional properties of these channels. We now demonstrate that expression of rClC-K1 in Xenopusoocytes induces currents similar to those described by Uchida et al. (7Uchida S. Sasaki S. Nitta K. Uchida K. Horita S. Nihei H. Marumo F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 104-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, rather similar currents but with an I− > Cl− conductance were reported by the same group for rClC-K2 and a rClC-K2 splice variant"

A 10-kDa internal domain contains the critical spectrin-actin binding activity required for membrane mechanical stability (1Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar), while the C-terminal 22–24-kDa domain has recently been reported to bind the immunophilin FKBP13 (13Walensky L.D. Gascard P. Fields M.E. Blackshaw S.

Two ternary protein complexes involving 4.1R have been identified in the erythrocyte membrane: spectrin-actin-4.1R (1Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar) and GPC-4.1R-p55 (4Chishti A.H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1998; 5: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex plays a critical role in imparting mechanical stability to the erythrocyte membrane. Binding of CaM to 4.1R decreases the affinity of its interaction with purified spectrin and actin in a Ca2+-dependent mannerin vitro (15Tanaka T. Kadowaki K. Lazarides E. Sobue K. J. Biol.

Invest. 1988; 82: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These data imply an important regulatory role for 4.1R in the function of the spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex. In the GPC-4.1R-p55 ternary complex, Marfatia et al. (17Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

In addition to its interaction with p55, the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R also interacts with a membrane-proximal basic peptide (RHK) in the cytoplasmic domain of GPC (GPC-3) (7Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Thus, three binary protein-protein interactions, GPC-4.1R, GPC-p55, and 4.1R-p55 constitute the GPC-p55–4.1R ternary complex. At present, little is known regarding the regulation of the various protein-protein interactions that constitute the GPC-4.1R-p55 ternary complex. We performed a detailed molecular and functional characterization of the role of 4.1R in regulating the GPC-4.1R-p55 ternary complex. We identified that sequences in the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R encoded by exon 8 and exon 10 constitute the binding motifs for GPC and p55, respectively. We showed that 4.1R binding to p55 increases the affinity of p55 binding to GPC by an order of magnitude, implying that 4.1R modulates the interaction between p55 and GPC. Finally, we documented that binding of CaM to 4.1R decreases the affinity of its interaction with both p55 and GPC in a Ca2+-dependent manner, implying that this ternary protein complex can undergo dynamic regulation in the membrane. These findings demonstrate an important role for 4.1R in regulating the GPC-4.1R-p55 ternary complex. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Meienhofer J. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 246-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The synthesized peptides were purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular mass of the different synthetic peptides was determined by mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) (27Karas M.

Protein-protein interactions and protein-peptide interactions were studied using the resonant mirror detection method (31Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J.

In the present study, the immobilized protein or peptide on the cuvette is referred to as the “ligand,” and the protein in the solution added to the cuvette as the “analyte.” The immobilization of proteins or peptides to the aminosilane cuvette has been previously described (8Nunomura W.

All of the binding assays were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (0.15m NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 7.4) at 25 °C with constant stirring. To analyze the binding of the p55-r30kDa complex to GPCcyt immobilized on the cuvette, equal amounts of p55 and r30kDa (0.1–1.0 μm) were preincubated at 25 °C for 30 min. To quantitate the effects of Ca2+ and CaM on the binding of various r30kDa proteins to transmembrane proteins and p55 immobilized on the surface of the cuvette, r30kDa proteins (50 nm to 1 μm) were preincubated with 5 μm CaM in buffer A (20 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 m NaCl) and either 0.1 mm EGTA or 1.1 mm CaCl2 and 1.0 mm EGTA at 25 °C for 30 min, and the binding assays were performed using the same buffers (8Nunomura W.

The procedures employed for kinetic analysis of the binding interactions and for the quantitation of the stoichiometry of analyte binding to ligand have been previously described (8Nunomura W.

The dissociation constant from this form of kinetic analysis (termed “K (D)kin”) is calculated as follows: K (D)kin =k d/k a, wherek a is the association rate constant andk d is the dissociation rate constant (8Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Tokimitsu R. Krauss S.W. Kawashima M. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30322-30328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 12Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y.

The stoichiometry of analyte binding to ligand was calculated according to the following equation: stoichiometry of analyte/ligand = (B max of analyte/molecular weight of analyte)/(amount of immobilized ligand on the cuvette/molecular weight of ligand) (12Nunomura W. Takakuwa Y. Parra M. Conboy J. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6360-6367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The molecular weight values used in the calculations for 4.1R, r30kDa, p55, and GPCcyt were 80,000, 35,500, 55,000, and 5000, respectively. The cuvettes were reused after cleaning with HCl. Original binding curves could be replicated after HCl washes, implying that the washing procedure used did not denature the immobilized ligands. Following the addition of native 4.1R to p55 immobilized on the cuvette, the kinetics of binding of 4.1R to p55 was quantitated by the resonant mirror detection system as an increase in arc seconds as a function of time (Fig. 2 A). After the binding response reached a plateau value, the addition of buffer solution without 4.1R resulted in dissociation of bound 4.1R from p55 and a consequent decrease in the binding response signal. The new plateau value was significantly higher than the initial base-line value, implying a specific interaction between 4.1R and p55. A similar specific binding response was observed following the addition of r30kDa to p55 immobilized on the cuvette (Fig. 2 B). In marked contrast, neither of the other functional domains of 4.1R (16-, 10-, and 22/24-kDa domains) nor denatured r30kDa (100 °C at 5 min) exhibited specific binding to p55 (data not shown). These data imply that 4.1R binds to p55 through its 30-kDa domain, a finding consistent with earlier studies (9Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8631-8634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Marfatia S.M. Morais-Cabral J., H. Kim A.C. Byron O. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Analysis of the binding response curves obtained at varying concentrations of analyte provided association rate constants (k a) of 3.8 × 104 and 4.0 × 104m−1 s−1and dissociation rate constants (k d) of 3.8 × 10−3 s−1 and 8.0 × 10−3 s−1 for interaction of 4.1R and r30kDa, respectively, with p55. Thus, both intact 4.1R and its r30kDa domain bind p55 with a similarK (D)kin value on the order of 0.1 μm (Table I). The stoichiometry of 4.1R binding to p55 was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Using the experimentally determined value of B max for 4.1R of 264 arc seconds and the amount of immobilized p55 on the cuvette to be 170 arc seconds, a molar ratio of 4.1R binding to p55 was derived to be approximately 1:1.Table IBinding affinities of binary interactions involving 4.1R, p55, and GPCAnalyteLigandK (Dkin)μmp554.1R0.10 ± 0.01r30kDa0.20 ± 0.054.1RGPCcyt0.09 ± 0.01GPC-1No bindingGPC-2No bindingGPC-30.10 ± 0.01r30kDaGPCcyt0.22 ± 0.03GPC-1No bindingGPC-2No bindingGPC-30.20 ± 0.01p55GPCcyt1.60 ± 0.25GPC-12.40 ± 0.05GPC-2No bindingGPC-3No bindingK (Dkin) values for the binary interactions of p55 and 4.1R, 4.1R and GPC, r30kDa and GPC, and p55 and GPC are shown.

(n = 3–5). Open table in a new tab K (Dkin) values for the binary interactions of p55 and 4.1R, 4.1R and GPC, r30kDa and GPC, and p55 and GPC are shown.

(n = 3–5). Having characterized the binary interaction between 4.1R and p55, we then examined binary interactions between GPC and 4.1R and between GPC and p55. 4.1R, r30kDa, or p55 was incubated with the entire cytoplasmic tail of GPC (GPCcyt) or different subdomains of the GPC cytoplasmic tail (synthetic peptides GPC-1, GPC-2, and GPC-3), immobilized on the cuvette. Analysis of the binding response curves provided association rate constants (k a) of 2.9 × 105m−1 s−1and 1.5 × 105m−1 s−1and dissociation rate constants (k d) of 2.7 × 10−2 and 3.3 × 10−2 s−1 for interaction of 4.1R and r30kDa, respectively, with GPCcyt. Thus, both intact 4.1R and its r30kDa domain bound GPCcyt with a similarK (D)kin value on the order of 0.1 μm (Table I). 4.1R and r30kDa also bound GPC-3 with a K (D)kin value on the order of 0.1 μm (Table I), but no binding could be documented between r30kDa and either GPC-1 or GPC-2 (Table I). These data imply a specific binary interaction between r30kDa and the membrane-proximal peptide GPC-3. p55 also exhibited specific binding to GPCcyt but with a much lower affinity (K (D)kin value on the order of 1.0 μm) (Table I). However, in contrast to the findings with 4.1R, p55 bound to GPC-1 (Table I) but not to either GPC-2 or GPC-3 (Table I). These results are consistent with previous reports (7Hemming N.J. Anstee D.J. Mawby W.J. Reid M.E. Tanner M.J.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Scatchard analysis of r30kDa and of p55 binding to GPCcyt revealed that the stoichiometry of both of these interactions is approximately 1:1. The finding that the stoichiometries of all three binary interactions (4.1R and p55, 4.1R and GPC, and p55 and GPC) is 1:1 suggests that these three proteins form a ternary complex in the erythrocyte membrane. To define the binding site for p55 in the 30-kDa domain of 4.1R, we quantitated p55 binding to various deletion mutants of r30kDa (Fig. 1). Deletion of sequence encoded by exon 10 completely abolished the binding of p55 to this mutant r30kDa (r30kDa/ΔEx.10) (Fig. 2 C and Table II). In contrast, mutant r30kDa with deletions of exon 5 or 8 or 11 (r30kDa/ΔEx.5, r30kDa/ΔEx.8, and r30kDa/ΔEx.11) bound p55 normally (data not shown), consistent with the idea that the p55 binding site is encoded by exon 10. The assignment of this region of 30 kDa as the p55 binding domain is further reinforced by the finding that p55 bound to the recombinant polypeptide encoded by exons 9–11 (r30kDa/Ex.9+10+11) with aK (D)kin value on the order of 0.1 μm (a value very similar to that seen for r30kDa) but did not bind to a derivative polypeptide from which exon 10 sequences were deleted (r30kDa/Ex.9+11) (Table II). These results mapped the p55 binding site to a stretch of 51 amino acids within the 30-kDa domain encoded by exon 10. This assignment was confirmed and further refined using a synthetic peptide. A 33-amino acid peptide (214YKDKLRINRFPWPKVLKISYKRSSFFIKIRPGE) also bound p55 with an affinity on the order of 0.1 μm. Furthermore, as with intact p55, the recombinant D5 domain of p55 (D5), which has previously been identified as the 4.1R binding site (17Marfatia S.M. Lue R.A. Branton D. Chishti A.H. J. Biol.

Whereas full-length r30kDa bound immobilized GPCcyt with aK (D)kin value of 0.22 μm, deletion of sequence encoded by exon 8 (r30kDa/ΔEx.8) markedly decreased the affinity of interaction between mutant r30kDa and the cytoplasmic domain of GPC (Table II). Other deletion mutants lacking sequences encoded by exons 5, 10, or 9 and 11 (r30kDa/ΔEx.5, ΔEx.10, ΔEx.9,11) bound with normal affinity (Table II). These findings suggest that the primary binding site for GPC is encoded by exon 8. The assignment of this region of 30 kDa as the GPC binding domain is further reinforced by the finding that GPC bound to the recombinant polypeptide encoded by exon 8 but not to the recombinant polypeptide encoded by exon 5 (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, these findings enable us to assign the sequence encoded by exon 8 (residues Tyr94 to Arg166) to be the primary binding motif for GPC and the sequence encoded by exon 10 (residues Tyr214 to Glu246) to be the binding motif for p55 in 4.1R. To further define the interactions among the three protein components of the ternary complex, 4.1R, p55, and GPC, we determined whether p55-GPC and 4.1R-GPC binary interactions can be regulated by the third member of the complex, namely, 4.1R and p55, respectively. The binding affinity of the p55-r30kDa complex to GPC-1 was increased by a factor of 10 compared with that of native p55 to immobilized GPC-1 (Table III). The 4.1R-induced increase in binding affinity of p55-GPC interaction was in large part due to an increase in the association rate constant (k a) from 5.1 × 103 to 1.6 × 105m−1s−1 with little or no effect on the dissociation rate constant (k d). This effect of 4.1R on p55-GPC interaction could also be mimicked using only the synthetic peptide, pep10, which contains the p55 binding domain of 4.1R (TableIII). Importantly, r30kDa/ΔEx.10, which can bind to GPCcyt but lacks the p55 binding domain, had no"
https://openalex.org/W1596884260,"The salivary fluid secretory mechanism is thought to require Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter-mediated Cl(-) uptake. To directly test this possibility we studied the in vivo and in vitro functioning of acinar cells from the parotid glands of mice with targeted disruption of Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter isoform 1 (Nkcc1), the gene encoding the salivary Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter. In wild-type mice NKCC1 was localized to the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, whereas expression was not detected in duct cells. The lack of functional NKCC1 resulted in a dramatic reduction (>60%) in the volume of saliva secreted in response to a muscarinic agonist, the primary in situ salivation signal. Consistent with defective Cl(-) uptake, a loss of bumetanide-sensitive Cl(-) influx was observed in parotid acinar cells from mice lacking NKCC1. Cl(-)/ HCO(3)(-) exchanger activity was increased in parotid acinar cells isolated from knockout mice suggesting that the residual saliva secreted by mice lacking NKCC1 is associated with anion exchanger-dependent Cl(-) uptake. Indeed, expression of the Cl(-)/ HCO(3)(-) exchanger AE2 was enhanced suggesting that this transporter compensates for the loss of functional Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) cotransporter. Furthermore, the ability of the parotid gland to conserve NaCl was abolished in NKCC1-deficient mice. This deficit was not associated with changes in the morphology of the ducts, but transcript levels for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the epithelial Na(+) channel were reduced. These data directly demonstrate that NKCC1 is the major Cl(-) uptake mechanism across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells and is critical for driving saliva secretion in vivo."

In SKW 6.4 cells, PKCμ is constitutively associated with p32 at mitochondrial membranes, evident from colocalization with cytochrome c. p32 interacts with PKCμ in a compartment-specific manner, as it can be coimmunoprecipitated mainly from the particulate and not from the soluble fraction, despite the presence of p32 in both fractions.

Interestingly, PKCμ-p32 immunocomplexes precipitated from the particulate fraction of two distinct cell lines, SKW 6.4 and 293T, show no detectable substrate phosphorylation. In support of a kinase regulatory function of p32, addition of p32 to in vitro kinase assays blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, aldolase but not autophosphorylation of PKCμ, suggesting a steric hindrance of substrate within the kinase domain.

PKCμ/PKD differ from the three major groups of PKC isozymes by the presence of an amino-terminal hydrophobic domain, an acidic domain (7Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol.

PKCμ is ubiquitously expressed, and evidence for the involvement of PKCμ in diverse cellular functions stems from reports showing enhancement of constitutive transport processes in PKCμ-overexpressing epithelial cells (9Prestle J.

In accordance with this is the finding that, upon B cell receptor stimulation, PKCμ is recruited together with the tyrosine kinase Syk and phospholipase Cγ to the B cell receptor complex and negatively regulates phospholipase Cγ activity (13Sidorenko S.P.

Whereas the latter selectively bind to the C1 regulatory domain of the atypical PKCλ and ζ and regulate kinase activity in a lipid messenger-independent manner (18Diaz-Meco M.T. Municio M.M.

By analogy, because of the ubiquitous expression of PKCμ and its apparent involvement in diverse cellular responses, the existence of cell type- and/or organelle-specific regulators of PKCμ can be postulated. Indeed, 14-3-3 proteins as well as phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases were recently identified to be associated specifically with the C1 region of PKCμ (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C.

To define other interacting proteins and to investigate their role in modulating kinase activity, we have used different PKCμ domains in various screening assays for PKCμ-binding proteins. The pleckstrin homology domain and the kinase domain of PKCμ were used in a yeast two-hybrid screen in order to identify new PKCμ-binding proteins. With the kinase domain as a bait, a novel PKC-binding protein was detected. We identified the multifunctional chaperon protein p32, previously described as a receptor of complement component C1q (23Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp.

To introduce BamHI restriction sites, the kinase domain of PKCμ covering amino acids 570–911 was amplified using the following primers: 5′-ATCCTCATAGGATCCAAATCACTA-3′ and 5′-ATCTCCTAGGATCCGTCAAAAC-3′. The amplified cDNA fragment was cloned either in pAS1 for yeast two-hybrid screening or in pGEX-3X (GST-μKin) to express glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The yeast strain Y190 was transformed with pAS1/PKCμ according to standard procedures (26Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Expression of the fusion protein was verified by Western blot analysis of yeast lysates using a PKCμ-specific antibody. A pACT λ bacteriophage library of human-activated B-lymphocytes was convertedin vitro to plasmids (27Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The human SKW 6.4 B cell line (ATCC) was cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. 293T cells were obtained from ATCC. A rabbit antibody and a monoclonal antibody directed against gC1qR/p32 were used (29Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J.

PKCμ, PKCζ, PKCδ, and JNK were detected with rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Roche Molecular Biochemicals), PKCα and cytochromec with monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; PharMingen), and GST with a goat antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Secondary alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Cy2-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from Dianova. Protease and phosphatase inhibitors were from Biomol. Phorbol ester (phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, PdBu) and phosphatidylserine were purchased from Sigma. SKW 6.4 and Sf158 cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 1 mmNaF, 1 mm NaPP, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 60 min cell lysis the lysates were centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), and immunoprecipitation was performed as described (31Storz P. Doppler H. Wernig A. Pfizenmaier K. Muller G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein pull-down assays were performed by incubation of 1 ml of lysate (representing 500,000 Sf158 cells or 50 × 106 SKW 6.4 cells) with the indicated amounts of GST fusion proteins coupled to glutathione-Sepharose for 60 min at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes or GST complexes were washed three times and applied to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot detection of PKCμ or p32 was performed according to standard procedures. 80 ng of purified recombinant PKCμ from Sf158 cells were preincubated as indicated with different amounts of GST or GST-p32 in phosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature. Kinase reaction in the absence or presence of phosphatidylserine/PdBu micelles, with or without 5 μg of aldolase as substrate, was started by addition of 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 10 μl of kinase buffer, and incubation was carried out for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 5× concentrated sample buffer, subsequently fractionated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and exposed upon autoradiography. Autoradiographs were analyzed by quantitative PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). After immunoprecipitation PKCμ substrate and autophosphorylation were determined in in vitro kinase assays as described (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K.

For cellular fractionation 4 × 108 SKW 6.4 and 3 × 108 293T cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing no detergent and homogenized by applying 15 strokes with a “very tight-fitting” 5-ml Dounce homogenizer (Braun, Melsungen, Germany). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (800 × g, 5 min). The remaining lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g. The supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was defined as the soluble fraction. The pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and defined as the non-soluble fraction. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 15 min at 37 °C. Permeabilization and blocking of the cells proceeded through incubation with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min. The cells were rinsed 3 times with PBS and then incubated with primary antibodies (0.05% Tween 20 and 5% normal goat serum in PBS). For immunofluorescence detection of the indicated proteins (see Figs. 3 and 4), cells were simultaneously incubated for 2 h with two different antibodies used in the following concentrations: PKCμ antibody at 4 μg/ml, anti-p32 or anti-coatomer CM1-A10 monoclonal antibodies at 3 μg/ml, p24 antibody at 1 μ g/ml, and anti-cytochrome C monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml. Incubation with Cy3- and Cy2-conjugated secondary antibodies (2 μg/ml) was performed for 1 h. Following staining, the cells were rinsed four times with PBS and mounted in mounting medium from Sigma (PBS/glycerol). In control stainings, no cross-reactivity of the anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies was observed (data not shown). A Leica confocal laser-scanning microscope was used for colocalization studies. Simultaneous excitation of fluorescent dyes was achieved by an argon/krypton laser. The following adjustments were made: 1) excitation filter, short pass KP590; 2) beam splitter module, neutral beam splitter; 3) channel 1 Cy3 emission, barrier filter long pass OG590; and channel 2 Cy2 emission, barrier filter band pass BP535. Images were acquired through a plan 100 or 63× (1.3 oil immersion) objective. The cells were sliced into horizontal optical sections at an interval of 1 μm.Figure 4PKC μ associates with p32 in mitochondria.

After primary transfection of yeast and verification of PKCμ/Gal4 fusion protein expression by immunoblot using a PKCμ kinase domain-specific antibody (data not shown), yeast cells were secondarily transfected with pACT vector containing a human B cell library expressing fusion proteins with the Gal4 DNA activation domain. Transfectants were selected for growth on aminotriazole-containing minimal medium according to standard procedures (27Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Plasmids were retrieved and subjected to sequence analysis of both strands using pACT-based primers. With the exception of one clone (Clone 138) all retrieved pACT plasmids displayed nonsense sequences resulting in premature translation termination and did not reveal Gal4 activation domain fusion proteins of significant length. Fig.1 B shows growth of Clone 138 on YPEG medium and the respective selection medium. The pACT plasmid was subjected to complete sequence analysis revealing a 1.5-kilobase pair cDNA insert. Upon data base searching, the sequence showed identity to a previously published cDNA coding for the glycoprotein p32/gC1q-R which binds to the globular head of C1q (23Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition to the complete coding region of p32, 21 base pairs of the 5′-untranslated region were included in the pACT cDNA insert resulting in an in frame addition of seven amino acids between activation domain of Gal4 and p32. For an independent experimental verification of PKCμ-p32 interaction, precipitation assays with GST fusion proteins were performed. Therefore, the coding region of p32 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, cloned in frame into pGEX-3X, and expressed as bacterial fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. Purified GST-p32, immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads, was used to precipitate PKCμ from whole cell extracts of PKCμ-expressing Sf158 cells (Fig. 2 A, top left panel). PKCμ could be specifically detected by Western blot analysis in GST-p32 precipitates using as little as 1 μg of fusion protein, whereas no signal was revealed in control precipitates using up to 16 μg of GST protein (Fig. 2 A, left panels). GST 14-3-3τ, which efficiently associates with the PKCμ regulatory domain (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), served as a positive control (Fig. 2 A, left panel, right lane). The respective amounts of fusion proteins used in precipitation assays were visualized by immunoblotting using an anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 A, bottom left panels). The same result was obtained using purified recombinant PKCμ (Fig. 2 A, top right panel), indicating direct molecular interaction of PKCμ with p32. The reciprocal precipitation was carried out with extracts from the B cell line SKW 6.4, which expresses p32 in significant amounts (see Figs. 2 C and 4) and a purified GST fusion protein of the PKCμ kinase domain (GST-μKin). Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a p32-specific rabbit antibody (Fig. 2 B, top panel) or a GST-specific antibody to estimate GST loads (Fig. 2 B, bottom panels). To demonstrate the specificity of the association, excessive amounts of GST protein (10-fold over GST-μKin) served as a negative control, which resulted in only a very weak staining (Fig. 2 B, right lanes). Thus, the data presented here provide clear evidence of specific association of p32 with the kinase domain of PKCμ. In parallel to the GST-p32 precipitation assays (Fig. 2, Aand B), association between PKCμ and p32 was independently demonstrated by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation analysis using p32- and PKCμ-specific antisera (Fig. 2 C). The somewhat weaker signal of p32 observed in PKCμ immunoprecipitates might be due to a steric hindrance by the PKCμ antibody, which is directed against carboxyl-terminal epitopes and thus could be in proximity to the p32 binding region. Phorbol ester treatment of cells or addition of phosphatidylserine/phorbol ester micelles to in vitropull-down assays did not enhance p32 binding to PKCμ (data not shown), suggesting a constitutive, lipid-independent association of p32 in SKW 6.4 cells. In order to assess the selectivity of p32 interaction with PKCμ, other PKC isotypes were analyzed by pull-down assays and coimmunoprecipitation analyses using three different recombinant PKC isotypes representing the three major PKC subgroups. By using GST-p32, in addition to PKCμ, a specific binding of PKCα, PKCζ, and PKCδ was noted (Fig. 3 A). As a control, precipitation analysis of the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) from lysates of 293T cells was performed. As shown in Fig.3 A (bottom panel), no binding of JNK could be detected. These results indicate a PKC-selective association of p32. Coimmunoprecipitation analyses using PKC-specific antibodies further confirmed interaction of p32 with members of the different PKC subgroups (Fig. 3 B). The association of PKCμ and p32 was further analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The literature on the cellular distribution of p32 is controversial, reporting p32 either localized at the cell membrane (33Peterson K.L. Zhang W. Lu P.D. Keilbaugh S.A. Peerschke E.I. Ghebrehiwet B. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 84: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), intracellularly (34van den Berg R.H. Prins F. Faber-Krol M.C. Lynch N.J. Schwaeble W. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3909-3916PubMed Google Scholar), or at mitochondria (29Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar), which may reflect cell-specific differences. Therefore, we investigated the intracellular localization of p32 in the SKW 6.4 B cell line. As shown in Fig. 4, in these cells p32 is localized predominantly at intracellular compartments (Fig. 4,top row, left panel). Costaining with antibodies against cytochrome c (Fig. 4, top row, middle panel) resulted in a nearly identical staining pattern, which was confirmed by overlay analysis indicated by the blue color shown in the top right panel. In SKW 6.4 cells, PKCμ shows a broad speckled distribution throughout extranuclear regions of the cell (Fig.4, middle row, left panel), with a clear enrichment in p32 positive, compartmentalized structures (Fig. 4, middle row, middle panel). Overlay of PKCμ- and p32-specific staining verifies a partial colocalization of both proteins (Fig. 4,middle row, right panel). A double staining with PKCμ (Fig. 4, bottom row, left panel) and cytochrome c(Fig. 4, bottom row, middle panel)-specific antibodies confirmed that PKCμ is partially located at mitochondria in SKW 6.4 cells (shown in blue at Fig. 4 in the bottom row, right panel). In 293T cells (Fig.5, upper panel) and in SKW 6.4 cells, only a weak colocalization signal with p24 was revealed (Fig. 5,bottom panels), which is in accordance with an enrichment of PKCμ at mitochondria in the latter cell line. The data presented here thus indicate a cell type-specific compartmentalization/enrichment of PKCμ either at mitochondria, in the B cell line SKW 6.4 (Fig. 4), or at Golgi structures in 293T cells (Fig. 5). Since in in vitro studies p32 specifically binds to PKCμ and appears to be constitutively associated with the kinase in the B cell line SKW 6.4, we investigated whether it affects PKCμ kinase activity in vitro. Incubation of PKCμ with GST-p32 led to a slight enhancement of autophosphorylation (Fig.6). We analyzed further whether substrate phosphorylation is affected by GST-p32 binding to PKCμ also. As shown in Fig. 6 A, phosphorylation of the well known in vitro substrate aldolase (7Gschwendt M. Johannes F.J. Kittstein W. Marks F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20742-20746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol.

PKCμ-mediated aldolase phosphorylation was not affected in the presence of 1 μg of GST protein (Fig. 5 B, right lane), indicating that inhibition of aldolase phosphorylation was not due to unspecific effects of the GST moiety. Quantitative analysis revealed, in the presence of 1 μg of GST-p32 an approximately 70% inhibition of aldolase phosphorylation (Fig. 7 A, right panel). These data suggest that p32 binding to the kinase domain restricts, probably by steric hindrance, the substrate access to PKCμ.Figure 7Compartment-specific inhibition of PKC μ substrate phosphorylation. PKCμ was immunoprecipitated (IP) from soluble and non-soluble fractionated 293T and SKW 6.4 cells using equal amounts of cell lysates and subjected to in vitro auto- and substrate phosphorylation (B). PKCμ and p32 expression was monitored in PKCμ immunoprecipitates by Western blot analysis (A). Data from one of three experiments performed with similar results are shown. p, particulate fraction; s, soluble fraction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A dose-dependent inhibition of substrate phosphorylation could be further demonstrated with in vitro kinase assays of immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 B). Addition of increasing amounts of p32 to PKCμ immunoprecipitates from 293T cells significantly inhibited aldolase phosphorylation, whereas autophosphorylation remained largely unaffected. In vitro inhibition of PKCμ substrate phosphorylation by p32 was not influenced by a concomitant phorbol ester activation (Fig. 6 C) pointing to distinct regulation mechanisms. In SKW 6.4 cells, endogenous PKCμ has been localized predominantly to particulate structures, yet a weak cytosolic staining suggested a broader distribution to other compartments as well (see Fig. 4). Likewise, in several cell types, PKCμ also appeared to be enriched in particulate structures (9Prestle J. Pfizenmaier K. Brenner J. Johannes F.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but a partial cytosolic location has also been reported (36Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and can be observed in the cell lines analyzed here (Figs. 4 and 5). In order to investigate whether or not the p32-PKCμ interaction and regulation of kinase activity is restricted to specific intracellular compartments, cell fractionation experiments were performed with 293T cells and SKW 6.4 cells. The results obtained support a compartment-specific regulation of PKCμ kinase activity by p32. Both cell lines express similar levels of endogenous p32 (Fig.7 A, bottom panel). PKCμ immunoprecipitates from soluble and particulate fractions of both SKW 6.4 and 293T cells were analyzed using PKCμ-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 7 A, approximately equal amounts of PKCμ were present in either the soluble or the particulate fraction, yet p32 could be predominantly detected in PKCμ precipitates from the particulate fraction (Fig.7 A, middle panel), although, under the experimental conditions applied here, both fractions contain comparable amounts of p32 (Fig. 7 A, bottom panel). PKCμ immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitroautophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.7 B, aldolase phosphorylation by PKCμ immunoprecipitates from the soluble fraction could be readily discerned, whereas PKCμ isolated from the particulate, p32-positive fraction did not show any detectable aldolase phosphorylation. Together with the data fromin vitro kinase assays with purified PKCμ and p32-GST fusion proteins (Fig. 6), these findings indicate a p32-dependent regulation of compartmentalized PKCμ kinase activity and suggest a new mechanism of regulation of kinase activity via kinase domain interacting proteins, identifying an as yet unrecognized functional role of p32 in this process. In this study, we identified by yeast two-hybrid screening a novel PKCμ-interacting protein, the previously described protein p32 (Fig.1), which has been associated with multiple, chaperon-like functions. p32 may serve as a compartment-specific regulator of PKCμ kinase activity. Cellular colocalization of PKCμ and p32 at mitochondria was shown in the B cell line SKW 6.4 by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4). Functional interaction of both proteins was shown by precipitation analysis with GST fusion proteins as well as by coimmunoprecipitation indicating a constitutive association of p32 with PKCμ (Fig. 2). As p32 causes inhibition of PKCμ substrate phosphorylation (Figs. 6 and 7), we propose a novel model of a chaperon-mediated control of PKCμ activation, in which PKCμ function is restricted to defined cellular compartments by the multifunctional protein p32. Accordingly, PKCμ kinase regulation by p32 may not only serve as a paradigm to explain a differential, cell-, and/or compartment-specific activation of ubiquitously expressed kinases by virtue of a cell-specific intracellular location/function of regulatory molecules but also provides new insight into regulation of kinase activity toward specific substrates by kinase domain interacting proteins (Figs. 6 and 7). These data show that PKCμ is, in addition to its regulation by lipids and 14-3-3 proteins (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), controlled by a p32-dependent mechanism that probably controls substrate access by steric hindrance. So far, the biological role of p32 appeared rather unclear due to the diverse functions reported; p32 has been originally identified as a cell surface protein binding to the globular “heads” of the complement factor C1q (23Ghebrehiwet B. Lim B.L. Peerschke E.I. Willis A.C. Reid K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1809-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It also has been described as a cell surface kininogen-binding protein (24Herwald H. Dedio J. Kellner R. Loos M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13040-13047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, several independent reports have described p32 as an intracellular protein (35Gommel D. Orci L. Emig E.M. Hannah M.J. Ravazzola M. Nickel W. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. Sohn K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar,37Dedio J. Muller-Esterl W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), which colocalizes in the endothelial cell line EA.hy926 with a mitochondrial marker protein (29Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar). p32 has been shown to be important for the maintenance of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (38Muta T. Kang D. Kitajima S. Fujiwara T. Hamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24363-24370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial functions of p32 are further indicated by the identification of a yeast homologue of p32, called Mam33p, that has been localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane (39Seytter T. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Yeast. 1998; 14: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other reports confirmed that p32 is located at mitochondria, but in addition a nuclear localization was found and a function of p32 as part of an import machinery was postulated (40Matthews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, p32 was described as part of the RNA splicing complex SF2 in HeLa cells (25Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). p32 has further been shown to associate with many viral proteins including HIV-1 Tat (41Yu L. Zhang Z. Loewenstein P.M. Desai K. Tang Q. Mao D. Symington J.S. Green M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3007-3016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Rev (42Luo Y., Yu, H. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3850-3856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as with EBNA-1 of Epstein-Barr virus (43Wang Y. Finan J.E. Middeldorp J.M. Hayward S.D. Virology. 1997; 236: 18-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The latter p32 functions are all considered to modulate transcription factor activity. The participation in different biological processes like mitochondrial functions, transcription- and splicing factor modulation, and potential role in complement cascade or blood coagulation (44Peerschke E.I. Jesty J. Reid K.B. Ghebrehiwet B. Blood Coagul. & Fibrinolysis. 1998; 9: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggest a typical chaperon function of p32. In this paper, we describe a novel aspect of p32 biology with a functional role as an inhibitor of kinase activity. The presented data show that p32 binds to the kinase domain of PKCμ and, without being a substrate, inhibits phosphorylation of aldolase, yet maintains or even enhances the level of autophosphorylation. As different phosphorylation sites trigger the activation state of PKC isoforms (45Dutil E.M. Keranen L.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29359-29362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Van Lint J.V. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1455-1461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), similar mechanisms are conceivable for PKCμ. For the p32-mediated regulation of PKCμ activity, several possibilities may be considered. First, p32 may interfere with substrate phosphorylation by steric hindrance. Second, p32 binding to PKCμ could induce a conformational change such that endogenous autophosphorylation sites are preferentially used over cellular substrates. Third, the phosphorylation sites critical for kinase activation are blocked by p32, disabling substrate phosphorylation, yet leaving autophosphorylation at other serine residues of PKCμ unaffected. Several phosphorylation sites important for PKCμ activation have now been mapped within the catalytic domain (47Vertommen D. Rider M. Ni Y. Waelkens E. Merlevede W. Vandenheede J.R. Van Lint J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19567-19576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which is in accordance with the latter model of p32 interference with PKCμ function. Together, our data presented here thus indicate that, besides regulation of PKCμ kinase activity via the C1 domain either by activating lipid second messengers and phorbol ester (1Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 3Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: 1134-1147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or inactivating 14-3-3 proteins (17Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), other domains are involved in modulating PKCμ activity also. Since in contrast to 14-3-3, p32 does not affect lipid-induced PKCμ autophosphorylation (Fig. 6), we propose that PKCμ activity is controlled by at least two independent mechanisms. Moreover, our finding that p32 binds to different PKC isoforms points to a more general p32-based mechanism of controlling PKC kinase activity. The differential cellular localization of p32 in different cell types (29Dedio J. Jahnen-Dechent W. Bachmann M. Muller-Esterl W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3534-3542PubMed Google Scholar, 40Matthews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) may contribute to the compartment-specific functional role of various PKC isotypes, including PKCμ. As shown here, in the SKW 6.4 cell line, p32 largely colocalized with cytochrome c, indicative of a mitochondrial localization (Fig. 4). In full accordance with the in vitro binding studies, PKCμ partially colocalized with p32 at mitochondria, as revealed from confocal microscopy (Fig. 4) and cell fractionation studies (Fig. 7). Therefore, we propose that p32 is part of an intracellular receptor that retains PKCμ at intracellular compartments such as mitochondria and serves as a regulator of its kinase activity.

The 90-kDa HCh reflects the absence of the B domain, whereas the 210-kDa species includes the intact B domain. The LCh (80 kDa) corresponds to the A3, C1, and C2 domains.

Cleavage at Arg740 removes the size-heterogeneous B domain from the HCh, producing a 90-kDa HCh fragment, and further cleavage of the 90-kDa HCh fragment (A1-A2) at Arg372 between the A1 and A2 domains produces 54- (A1) and 44-kDa (A2) species. Cleavage of the 80-kDa LCh fragment (A3-C1-C2) at Arg1689 between the B and A3 domains removes 40 amino-terminal acidic peptides from the A3 domain and produces a 72-kDa fragment. A unique cleavage by FXa at Arg1721 produces a 67-kDa LCh fragment. The active form of FVIII is a metal-linked heterotrimer consisting of the A1/A2/A3-C1-C2 domains, lacking the middle B domain (6Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L.

Cleavage at Arg740 between the A2 and B domains does not contribute to the generation of the FVIII activity. In contrast, cleavages at Arg372 and Arg1689are essential for optimal FVIII activity (11Shima M. Ware J. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. Fulcher C.A.

Activation of human FVIII at its physiological concentration and at pH 7.4 is followed by a reduction in activity (14Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This loss of activity is not caused by further proteolysis but by dissociation of the A2 domain from the active form of FVIII heterotrimer (15Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Thrombin cleavage at Arg1689 dissociates FVIII from its complex with vWF (16Hamer R.J. Koedam J.A. Beeser-Visser N.H. Sixma J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and subsequently free FVIII promotes tenase activity on phospholipid (PL) micelles. On the other hand, FXa cleaves only the free form of FVIII, and FXa-catalyzed FVIII activation is completely prevented by the formation of the FVIII·vWF complex (17Koedam J.A. Hamer R.J.

In the present study we demonstrated that the C2 domain bound to anhydro-thrombin, a catalytically inactive derivative of thrombin, and also that an anti-FVIII antibody with a C2 epitope that inhibited both the thrombin-catalyzed FVIII activation and proteolytic cleavage at Arg1689 blocked thrombin binding to the C2 domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteinsFVIII was affinity-purified using monoclonal antibody (mAb) NMC-VIII/10 recognizing the FVIII A3 domain (22Shima M.

Purified human α-thrombin (specific activity 3,000 NIH units/mg) was obtained from Sigma.Anti-FVIII AntibodiesA human antibody, A-FF, was obtained from a multitransfused patient with severe hemophilia A. IgG preparations were fractionated by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and F(ab)′2 fragments were prepared using immobilized pepsin-Sepharose (Pierce) and protein A-Sepharose. The inhibitor titer was 3,100 Bethesda units/ml (BU/ml) (26Kasper C.K. Aledort L.M. Counts R.B. Edson J.R. Frantatoni J. Green D. Hampton J.W. Hilgartner M.W. Lazerson J. Levine P.H. McMillan C.W.

Conjugation of antibodies with peroxidase was performed as previously reported (31Suzuki H. Shima M. Arai M. Kagawa K. Fukutake K. Kamisue S. Nakai H. Morichika S. Tanaka I. Inoue M. Gale K.

Fifty μg of recombinant C2 domain was coupled to 1 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thirty μg of A-FF F(ab)′2 was applied to C2 domain-Sepharose CL-4B and then eluted using 0.1 mglycine, pH 2.0. The inhibitor titer of C2-specific F(ab)′2was 850 BU/mg.Protein IodinationFVIII fragments were radiolabeled with 0.5 mCi of Na125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by immobilized IODO-GEN® (Pierce) as described previously (32Fraker P.J. Speck J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). The remaining free Na125I was removed by chromatography on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific radioactivities for all FVIII fragments ranged from 6 to 10 μCi/μg protein. Radiolabeled FVIII fragments were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C for up to 1 month.Preparation of Anhydro-thrombinAnhydro-thrombin, a catalytically inactive derivative of thrombin in which the active-site serine is converted to dehydroalanine, was prepared as reported elsewhere. 3K. Hosokawa, T. Ohnishi, M. Nagata, and T. Koide, submitted for publication. In outline, the active-site serine residue of thrombin was chemically modified with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To convert the phenylmethylsulfonylated serine residue of the modified thrombin to the dehydroalanine residue, the product was incubated with 0.05 m NaOH for 12 min at 0 °C, and then the pH was adjusted to 7.5. After dialysis against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NaCl, anhydro-thrombin was purified by benzamidine-Sepharose 4B column chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anhydro-thrombin thus prepared demonstrated <1% of thrombin activity, and its molecular mass was estimated to be 35 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), similar to that of the native thrombin (data not shown).Neutralization AssayA-FF F(ab)′2 was adjusted to 3 BU/ml and incubated with serial dilutions of FVIII fragments for 2 h at 37 °C. The mixture was further incubated with an equal volume of normal-pooled plasma for 2 h, and the inhibitor titer was measured in the Bethesda assay. All dilutions were prepared using veronal buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 7 mm sodium barbital, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.4), containing 2% human serum albumin (HSA). The percent neutralization was calculated as follows: (1 − inhibitor titer in the presence of FVIII fragment/inhibitor titer in the absence of FVIII fragment) × 100 (%). No FVIII activity was detected in FVIII fragments used in this assay.Immunoprecipitation (IP) AssayThe binding of each 125I-FVIII fragment to A-FF F(ab)′2 was measured quantitatively in an IP assay using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (21Prescott R. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Scharrer I. Nilsson I.M. Humphries J.E. Hurst D. Bray G. Scandella D. Blood. 1997; 89: 3663-3671Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IP values (IP unit/ml) were calculated as follows: bound/(total 125I-FVIII fragment − nonspecific) × antibody dilution × 20.Activation of FVIII by ThrombinOne hundred nm of FVIII diluted in veronal buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, 7 mm sodium barbital, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2% HSA was incubated with 15 nm thrombin at 37 °C. At timed intervals, samples (10 μl) were taken from the mixture, and the activation was terminated by 1 mm PMSF, followed by a 1000-fold dilution with veronal buffer at 4 °C. Each sample was tested for the FVIII activity in a one-stage clotting assay. The presence of thrombin and PMSF in the diluted samples did not affect the FVIII activity in the coagulation assay. For the experiments on the effect of antibody on FVIII activation by thrombin, A-FF F(ab)′2 was incubated with FVIII for 2 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of thrombin. F(ab)′2 obtained from the plasma of a hemophilia A patient with no inhibitor was used as a control. To determine the neutralizing effect of FVIII fragments on the inhibition of thrombin activation by A-FF, 100 nm of each FVIII fragment was preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C with A-FF F(ab)′2 adjusted to 2 BU/ml. The mixtures were then incubated with intact FVIII for 2 h, followed by the addition of thrombin.Analyses of FVIII Cleavage by ThrombinSDS-PAGETwenty nm125I-FVIII diluted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) was incubated with 15 nm thrombin. At timed intervals, samples (20 μl) were taken, and activation was terminated by adding 0.4% SDS and boiling for 5 min. Each sample was analyzed on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography of dried gels. For the experiments on the effects of A-FF on thrombin cleavage of FVIII, 0.5 μm of A-FF F(ab)′2 was incubated with125I-FVIII for 2 h at 37 °C prior to the addition of thrombin.Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Evaluation of Thrombin Cleavage at Arg1689Microtiter plates (NUNC, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 0.2 μm mAb C5 in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6. After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% HSA for 2 h at 37 °C, 20 nm FVIII was added to each well and incubated for 2 h, followed by the addition of 15 nm thrombin. At timed intervals, supernatants were removed, and 1 mm PMSF was added to the well at 4 °C to quench the thrombin reaction with the captured FVIII. Bound FVIII was determined by peroxidase-conjugated mAb NMC-VIII/10 recognizing the acidic region of LCh, followed by the addition of o-phenylenediamine dissolved in 25 mm citric acid, 50 mmNa2HPO4, and 0.03% H2O2. H2SO4 (2m) was added as a quenching agent, and the absorbance was read at 492 nm (Lab System Multiskan Multisoft, Helsinki, Finland). For the experiments on the effects of A-FF on thrombin cleavage at Arg1689 of LCh, serial dilutions of A-FF F(ab)′2 or C2-specific F(ab)′2 were incubated with FVIII for 2 h at 37 °C prior to adding to the mAb C5-coated wells. The presence of PMSF did not interfere with this assay, and two mAbs did not inhibit thrombin cleavage of FVIII and did not compete with A-FF for FVIII binding (data not shown). The rate of LCh cleavage was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound − nonspecific A492)/(bound at time zero − nonspecific A492)) × 100 (%). Absorbance in the absence of FVIII was regarded as nonspecific.In competitive inhibition experiments using FVIII fragments (72-kDa LCh, HCh or recombinant C2 domain), 0.2 μm of NMC-VIII/10 was coated onto microtiter wells as described above. In this assay, 100 nm of each FVIII fragment was added together with thrombin, and peroxidase-conjugated NMC-VIII/5 was used for detection of bound FVIII.Binding Assay by ELISA Using Immobilized Anhydro-thrombinFive μg of anhydro-thrombin in TBS, pH 7.4, was immobilized onto each microtiter well. After blocking with 4% HSA, serial dilutions of FVIII fragments were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Bound FVIII was detected by peroxidase-conjugated mAb NMC-VIII/5, JR8, or C5 which did not affect thrombin action. In competitive experiments using FVIII fragments, 50 nm125I-FVIII and serial dilutions of FVIII fragments were mixed prior to the addition to immobilized anhydro-thrombin. Bound125I-FVIII was measured in a γ-counter. The percent inhibition was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound count − nonspecific count)/(maximum − nonspecific)) × 100 (%). The count in the absence of FVIII fragments or 125I-FVIII was regarded as maximum or nonspecific, respectively.Kinetics Measurement Using Real-time Biomolecular Interaction AnalysisThe kinetics of FVIII and thrombin interaction was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a BIAcore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Anhydro-thrombin was covalently coupled to an activated carboxymethyl dextran-coated sensor chip surface at a coupling density of 7 ng/mm2. Binding (association) of the ligand was monitored in TBS, pH 7.4, 0.005% Tween 20 at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 4 min. Dissociation was monitored over a 5–10-min range after return to a buffer flow. After each analysis, regeneration of the chip surface was achieved by 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.0, for 2 min. The association rate constants (k a) and dissociation rate constants (k d) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis as described previously (33O'Shannessy D.J. Bringham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 4457-4468Google Scholar) using the evaluation software provided by Biacore AB. Equilibrium dissociation constants (K d) were calculated ask d/k a.Effect of A-FF on 125I-C2 or 125I-A2 Domain Binding to Anhydro-thrombinSerial dilutions of A-FF F(ab)′2 were incubated with 100 nm125I-C2 or 125I-A2 domain for 2 h at 37 °C and then added to immobilized anhydro-thrombin (5 μg). Bound 125I-C2 or 125I-A2 domain was measured in a γ-counter. The percent inhibition was calculated as follows: (1 − (bound count − nonspecific count)/(maximum − nonspecific)) × 100 (%). The counts in the absence of A-FF or 125I-C2 and 125I-A2 domain were regarded as maximum or nonspecific, respectively.DISCUSSIONA-FF, a human antibody obtained from a multitransfused patient with severe hemophilia A, was a highly potent FVIII inhibitor. It blocked both thrombin-catalyzed FVIII activation and cleavage. Therefore, we hypothesized that the antibody might recognize crucial regions for the interaction between FVIII and thrombin. Epitope analyses by neutralization assays and IP assays revealed that the major epitope is located within the C2 domain of FVIII, strongly suggesting that the region is associated with thrombin-catalyzed activation of FVIII. The inhibitory effects of A-FF on FVIII and thrombin interaction may be mediated both in direct and indirect manners. The antibody may inhibit thrombin binding to FVIII directly or it may interfere with the thrombin cleavage site of FVIII directly or indirectly by a steric hindrance. Alternatively, it is possible that the amino-terminal acidic region of the A3 domain of FVIII may be closely associated with the C2 domain in the three-dimensional conformation. vWF-binding sites are known to be located in both the C2 and A3 domains, and FVIII and vWF association is enhanced by the presence of both regions (34Saenko E.L. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18007-18014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The present anti-C2 antibody, therefore, might have inhibited thrombin cleavage in the amino-terminal A3 region. In addition, the presence of an epitope in the A3-C1 region could not be excluded by our epitope localization experiments, and such an antibody possibly contributes to inhibit thrombin cleavage. Quantitative kinetic analyses were undertaken, therefore, to closely examine these interactions.The thrombin-binding site on FVIII has not been identified with certainty, and the relationship between the thrombin-binding site and its catalytic target site for action remains unknown. Experiments using mutant FVIII produced by site-directed mutagenesis together with studies of naturally occurring dysfunctional FVIII molecules from plasma of hemophiliacs have revealed that the mutation of Arg372 does not affect thrombin cleavage at Arg1689 (11Shima M. Ware J. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. Fulcher C.A. Blood. 1989; 74: 1612-1617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kamisue S. Shima M. Nishimura T. Tanaka I. Nakai H. Morichika S. Takata N. Kuramoto A. Yoshioka A. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 86: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 35Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Similarly, mutation of Arg1689 does not affect a cleavage at Arg372. These findings strongly suggest, therefore, that proteolyses at Arg372 and Arg1689 occur independently. In our experiments, A-FF blocked only the cleavage at Arg1689, but not at Arg372, and C2-specific F(ab)′2 also inhibited the cleavage at Arg1689. Furthermore, LCh and C2 domain competitively inhibited the cleavage at Arg1689 but HCh fragment did not compete, supporting the concept that thrombin-catalyzed reactions are independent at both sites.Conventional FVIII binding assays using active thrombin are extremely difficult to interpret because activation of FVIII by thrombin-catalyzed cleavage might deplete physiological binding responses. The use of inactive thrombin prepared by modification with several synthetic serine protease inhibitors, such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate, has been considered to minimize enzyme-catalyzed degradation, but conformational change and steric hindrance due to incorporation of diisopropyl phosphate group into the active site of thrombin might disrupt the interaction with FVIII. In the current studies we established a direct binding assay using anhydro-thrombin, a catalytically inactivated thrombin in which the serine residue in the active site was converted to dehydroalanine. The K dvalue of FVIII binding to anhydro-thrombin was 48 nm, and the binding pattern was dose-dependent. Thus, although binding to anhydro-thrombin might not be directly equivalent to the physiological interaction, the modified enzyme offered the advantages that the binding experiments could be performed in the absence of proteolytic activity, and steric hindrance due to modification of the active site and conformational changes was minimal.Both the 80-kDa LCh and HCh fragments bound to anhydro-thrombin in a dose-dependent manner with similar kinetic parameters. The equilibrium dissociation constants of both chains were larger than that of intact FVIII, but the K d value of a mixture of both fragments was similar to that of the intact FVIII. These findings are consistent with the proposal that thrombin-binding sites on the LCh and HCh are independent of each other although the maximum thrombin binding requires the presence of both chains. The 72-kDa LCh fragment bound to anhydro-thrombin with a higher affinity than that of the 80-kDa LCh, indicating that the thrombin-binding site on the LCh is not located within the amino-terminal acidic region of the A3 domain.We further demonstrated that the recombinant C2 domain as well as the A2 domain bound to anhydro-thrombin, confirming the presence of binding sites in both domains. The C2 domain is known to contain both vWF- and PL-binding sites (18Saenko E.L. Shima M. Rajalakshmi K.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11601-11605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Foster P.A. Fulcher C.A. Houghten R.A. Zimmerman T.S. Blood. 1990; 75: 1999-2004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although FVIII activation by thrombin is not believed to be influenced by the presence of vWF or PL (15Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Neuenschwander P. Jesty J. Blood. 1988; 72: 1761-1770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FVIII binding to anhydro-thrombin in the current investigations was also not affected by the presence of vWF or PL (data not shown), suggesting that the thrombin-binding site in the C2 domain is separated from the vWF- and PL-binding sites. In our previous work (20Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) we identified the FXa-binding site within the C2 domain, and we demonstrated that binding of FXa was completely inhibited by the presence of the vWF. This is markedly in contrast to the binding profile of thrombin demonstrated in the current study. Therefore, it should be pointed out that the thrombin-binding site does not overlap with the FXa-binding site, although both enzymes cleave the same sites of FVIII.In general, enzyme-binding sites are located within or close to their respective cleavage sites. Exceptions are often documented, however, and in part"

The human enzyme shows aK m value for ethanol which is 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of rat class IV. The uniquely significant difference in the substrate-binding pocket between the two enzymes appears to be at position 294, Val in the human enzyme and Ala in the rat enzyme. Moreover, a deletion at position 117 (Gly in class I) has been pointed out as probably responsible for class IV specificity toward retinoids. With the aim of establishing the role of these residues, we have studied the kinetics of the recombinant human and rat wild-type enzymes, the human G117ins and V294A mutants, and the rat A294V mutant toward aliphatic alcohols and retinoids. 9-cis-Retinol was the best retinoid substrate for both human and rat class IV, strongly supporting a role of class IV in the generation of 9-cis-retinoic acid. In contrast, 13-cisretinoids were not substrates. The G117ins mutant showed a decreased catalytic efficiency toward retinoids and toward three-carbon and longer primary aliphatic alcohols, a behavior that resembles that of the human class I enzyme, which has Gly117. TheK m values for ethanol dramatically changed in the 294 mutants, where the human V294A mutant showed a 280-fold increase, and the rat A294V mutant a 50-fold decrease, compared with those of the respective wild-type enzymes. This demonstrates that the Val/Ala exchange at position 294 is mostly responsible for the kinetic differences with ethanol between the human and rat class IV.

These forms have been grouped into at least six classes according to their structural and enzymatic properties (1Jörnvall H. Höög J.O. Alcohol Alcohol. 1995; 30: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of each class can be estimated from its kinetic characteristics and organ distribution. Thus, classes I and II, with low or moderate K m for ethanol, are those mostly responsible for hepatic ethanol metabolism in humans. Class III exhibits activity with long chain primary alcohols, but its major function is the elimination of formaldehyde, acting as a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (2Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Classes V and VI are little defined and only detected at the mRNA level. Recently, much effort has been devoted to the functional and molecular characterization of class IV. Its localization in the stomach and a moderate K m for ethanol of the human enzyme make it suitable for a contribution to the first-pass metabolism of ethanol (3Moreno A. Parés X. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 16796-16801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and have an increased risk of embryonic lethality during vitamin A starvation (14Deltour L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Dev. Genet. 1999; 25: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although class I ADH is also active with retinoids, class IV, or ςς, is the most active ADH form in humans (9Yang Z.N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Structural features responsible for class IV specificity have been investigated using molecular models, in which docking simulations with retinoid isomers indicate a better binding of these molecules to the class IV active site in comparison to that of class I, suggesting that deletion at position 117 facilitates their binding (15Kedishvili N.Y.

Recently, the x-ray structure of human class IV ADH has revealed an active site more suitable for oxidation of long chain aliphatic alcohols, such as retinols, than for short chain molecules, e.g. ethanol, in contrast with the opposite behavior of the class I β1β1-isozyme (18Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 19Xie P. Hurley T.D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An intriguing feature of class IV enzymes is the strong variation of kinetic properties between enzymes of different mammalian species. Thus, the human enzyme exhibits a K m for ethanol ∼100-fold lower than that of the rat form, at pH 7.5 (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the two enzymes show 88% identity in amino acid sequence, and exchanges at the substrate-binding site are scarce, the most interesting being at position 294. This position is a Val in most animal ADHs, but an Ala in the rat and mouse class IV enzymes, both with high K m values for ethanol (21Julià P. Farrés J. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 22Downes J. Holmes R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 372: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The exchange to a smaller and less hydrophobic residue in this area is compatible with low affinity for small substrate molecules, and we hypothesized that this substitution was responsible for the dramatic kinetic differences between the rat and human class IV enzymes (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,23Parés X. Cederlund E. Moreno A. Hjelmqvist L. Farrés J. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present work, the influence of the Val/Ala exchange on the class IV kinetics with retinoids and ethanol has been assessed from the inversely complementary properties of the human class IV V294A and the rat A294V mutants. Moreover, we have investigated the role in substrate specificity of the deletion at position 117, a specific feature of class IV, by the construction of a human class IV mutant with Gly117 (G117ins), as found in class I. The differences in the substrate-binding pocket between the x-ray structure of human class IV (18Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the models of rat enzyme, and the respective 294 mutants have been studied. Substrate docking with several retinol isomers also highlighted the importance of positions 117 and 294. A rat class IV (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) ADH-specific probe (50 ng) was labeled with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the random-priming method (Prime-a-Gene labeling system, Promega). The labeled probe was used in a plaque hybridization procedure to screen a “5′-stretch” rat (adult Sprague-Dawley male) lung cDNA library in λ gt11 (CLONTECH). One positive cDNA clone was isolated and λ DNA was prepared by a plate lysate method (24Benson S.A. Taylor R.K. BioTechniques. 1984; 2: 126-127Google Scholar). The cDNA insert was excised by EcoRI digestion and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. The insert was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). DNA sequence determination was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar), using fluorescently labeled T7 and T3 primers with the Auto Read Sequencing Kit, in an ALF Sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 5′- and 3′-ends of the rat class IV ADH cDNA were obtained by direct amplification from the λ gt11 cDNA library (26Friedman K.D. Rosen N.L. Newman P.J. Montgomery R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) combined with the use of two sets of nested λ gt11 and class IV-specific primers. The 5′-end primers (RAT1, 5′-GGAGTCACTTTGTCACCTGGTCTC-3′ and RAT2, 5′-TGGGTTGCATTCTCTACACTGTGG-3′) were complementary to the sequence corresponding to amino acids 84–90 and 95–102, respectively. The 3′-primers (RAT3, 5′-GACATGGAAGGGCTGCGTCTTTGG-3′ and RAT4, 5′-GCAGAGATGATGTTCCCAAATTGG-3′) corresponded to amino acids 313–321 and 325–332, respectively. The λ gt11-nested primers were 5′-ATGGAAACCAGCCATCGCCATCTG-3′ and 5′-AGGCACATGGCTGAATATCGACGG-3′ for the left arm, and 5′-TGGCCTGCCCGGTTATTATTATTT-3′ and 5′-TACGCGAAATACGGGCAGACATGG-3′ for the right arm. To obtain the 3′-end containing the poly(A) tail, cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of rat liver poly(A)+ RNA using the R0 R1-(dT)17 primer-adaptor (27Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and the Riboclone kit (Promega). For the amplification of poly(A)+end, the following primers were used: RAT5 (5′-GGAAAAGAAATTTGACC-3′), RAT6 (5′-TCGGACTGTCCTGACATTTTG-3′), complementary to the sequence corresponding to amino acids 337–342 and 368–374, respectively; and R0 (5′-AAGGATCCGTCGACATC-3′) and R1 (5′-GACATCGATAATACGAC-3′), corresponding to the primer-adaptor sequence. PCR amplifications were performed with the Expand High Fidelity kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR products were repaired with T4 DNA polymerase, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript II SK(+). The cDNA containing the region coding for ςς-ADH was obtained by the PCR method from a λ gt11 human stomach cDNA library. The sense HUM1 (5′-GATCCAAGACAAAGACCATATGGGCACTGCTGG-3′) and antisense HUM2 (5′-GTGAGACAGATACATGAATTCAGATGAGGGAAC-3′) primers were designed according to the known cDNA sequence (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), including recognition sites (underlined) for the restriction endonucleases NdeI (for which ATG initiates the translation) and EcoRI, respectively. The complete cDNA encoding rat class IV ADH was amplified by PCR from the 5′-stretch λ gt11 rat lung cDNA library with the sense RAT7 (5′-CATGAAGCTTCAGGAAAGCCCATATGGACAGTC-3′) and the antisense RAT8 (5′-CATGGGATCCTCAAAATGTCAGGACAGTCCGAA-3′) primers, containing recognition sequences (underlined) for the restriction endonucleases NdeI and BamHI, respectively. The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript II SK(+) and sequenced. After NdeI/EcoRI orBamHI excision, the cDNAs were subcloned into the expression vector pET5a (Promega). The E. coli strain BL21(DE3)/plysS was transformed with the final constructs pET/HUM12 and pET/RAT78, and grown in 5 liters of liquid Terrific Broth medium. When an OD at 595 nm of 0.65 was reached, a 2-h induction of protein expression was performed by the addition of 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the culture. To obtain the V294A mutant, four primers were used in three PCR reactions. The primers HUM1 and HUM3 (5′-CATCTTGGCTGATGATGGAGGAGCTCCTACAACCAC-3′), containing the antisense mutation (underlined), were used in the PCR 1 construct. The primers HUM4 (5′-TTGTAGGAGCTCCTCCATCAGCCAAGATGCTCA-3′), containing the sense mutation (underlined), and HUM2 were used in the PCR2 construct. The products from PCR1 and PCR2 were mixed with HUM1 and HUM2 primers in a third PCR reaction, obtaining the ςς-ADH coding region, including the V294A mutation. The same procedure was followed for the G117ins mutant but using HUM5 (5′-GATCTCCACGACCGGTACCAATATCGCTCCTAA-3′) and HUM6 (5′-ATTAGGAGCGATATTGGTACCGGTCGTGGAGTA-3′) as the mutagenic primers. The mutated PCR products were cloned into pET5a. To construct the A294V mutant, the RAT9 (5′-TTGCCATATGAACTATGGGACCAGCGTGGTGGTCGGGGTACCTCC-3′), containing the A294V substitution, and RAT8 primers were used in a PCR amplification. The mutated PCR product was cloned into pET/RAT78 by endonuclease excision and substitution for the corresponding wild-type DNA fragment. All mutated DNA fragments were checked by sequencing prior to expression. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced cells from a 5-liter culture (18 g wet weight) were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were frozen at −80 °C to facilitate cell lysis and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, 10% sucrose, 0.05% sodium azide, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Glass beads (diameter 0.5 μm) were added, and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 20 min and incubated with DNase (18 mg/g wet weight) at room temperature for 30 min to reduce sample viscosity. The homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was treated with 0.6% protamine sulfate and incubated on ice for 30 min, and it was centrifuged at 20,000 × gfor 15 min. The supernatant resulting from the centrifugation was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 8.9, and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer (3Moreno A. Parés X. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1128-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was eluted with a 0–150 mm NaCl linear gradient (1000 ml), and the active fractions were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against the initial buffer, and applied to a AMP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 15 cm). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (500 ml) of 20–100 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 8.2, and the active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. Starch gel electrophoresis, followed by activity staining with ethanol or 2-buten-1-ol as a substrate (28Parés X. Julià P. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel with subsequent silver staining were used to assess the degree of purity after each step of purification. For the V294A mutant enzyme the same purification procedure was used. For the G117ins mutant, an additional gradient from 100 to 400 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmDTT, pH 8.2 (500 ml) was necessary to elute the enzyme from the AMP-Sepharose column. Only the differences with respect to the purification procedure for the human enzyme are detailed. The complete cell lysis was obtained by shaking the cell resuspension with glass beads (diameter 0.5 μm) in a bead beater (Biospec Products). The buffer used during the purification was 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.9. The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer, and the enzyme was eluted with a 0–150 mm NaCl linear gradient (500 ml). The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a Blue-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (1 × 15 cm). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (400 ml) of 20–300 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.9. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against the initial buffer, and applied to a Q-column (Waters). Elution of the enzyme was performed with a 0–250 mm sodium acetate linear gradient. Alcohol dehydrogenase activity with alcohols was determined by monitoring the formation of NADH at 25 °C in a Varian Cary 219 spectrophotometer by measurements at 340 nm. Alcohol oxidation was measured in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, or in 0.1 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10. Kinetic parameters were obtained from activity measurements, with substrate concentrations that ranged from 0.1× Km to 10×Km, except for ethanol with the V294A mutant and rat wild-type enzyme, where saturation with this substrate could not be reached. Each individual rate measurement was run in duplicate. Three determinations were performed for each kinetic constant. The dissociation constant for NAD+(K ia), and the K m values for NAD+ and ethanol were calculated by fitting the kinetic data to a sequential Bi Bi mechanism (29Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Kinetics with retinoids (Sigma) were performed according to published procedures (8Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Allali-Hassani A. Peralba J.M. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), using the following molar absorbances of ε328 = 39500m−1 cm−1 for all-trans-retinol, ε326 = 39,733m−1 cm−1 for 9-cis-retinol, ε330 = 43751m−1 cm−1 for 13-cis-retinol, ε400 = 29,500m−1 cm−1 for all-trans-retinal, and ε367 = 26,700m−1 cm−1 for 9-cis-retinal. 9-cis-Retinol was synthesized by reduction of 9-cis-retinal with sodium borohydride (30Heller J. Horwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 6308-6316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the purity was checked by high pressure liquid chromatography. Tween 80 (0.02%) was used to solubilize retinoids according to established protocols (8Boleda M.D. Saubi N. Farrés J. Parés X. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 10Allali-Hassani A. Peralba J.M. Martras S. Farrés J. Parés X.

The kinetic constants were obtained by means of the ENZFITTER (Elsevier Biosoft) and SEQUEN or COMP (29Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar) programs. The values were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered statistically significant when thep value was <0.01. A three-dimensional model of rat class IV ADH was constructed by adopting its amino acid sequence into the known fold of the human class IV ADH dimer (PDB code, 1AGN; Ref. 18Xie P. Parsons S.H. Speckhard D.C. Bosron W.F. Hurley T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18558-18563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using the ICM program (version 2.7, Molsoft LLC, 1997), as described (16Moreno A. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Persson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The atomic positions of the coenzyme were tethered to ones corresponding to the crystallographic coordinates, to avoid undesired displacements. The quality of the model was assessed with the PROCHECK program (31Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). To study interactions between the enzyme and different substrates, a nonrigid docking was used based upon a Monte Carlo procedure (32Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 983-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar) with 500,000 iterative cycles, allowing free movement of the substrate, its rotable bonds, and the χ angles of the residues inside a 5 Å radius from the docked substrate. Additional distance restraints were imposed: 2.0–2.4 Å between the alcohol oxygen of retinol and the catalytic zinc ion, 2.0–4.0 Å between C15 of retinol and C4 of NAD, and 2.0–4.0 Å between the alcohol oxygen and the oxygen of the side chain hydroxyl group of Thr48. Energy values were calculated with the ICM program, which includes the REBEL method for estimation of electrostatic free energy and the constant surface tension method with 20 cal/Å2 for calculation of hydrophobic energy. As a binding score, a docking energy value was calculated by subtracting the energy values of the isolated molecules from the energy value of the enzyme-retinoid complex. A composite full-length sequence for rat class IV cDNA encompassed 2052 bp (Fig. 1) and was obtained via screening of a rat lung cDNA library and using reverse transcription-PCR of rat liver RNA. The sequences isolated from the lung cDNA library included nucleotides 1–1685, whereas an overlapping PCR fragment from liver RNA extended the 3′-sequence up to position 2052. A part of the 3′-untranslated region including nucleotides 1182–2017 was also amplified from rat genomic DNA and sequenced, matching the sequence isolated from liver RNA and showing that this was not a cloning artifact. Both the 5′- and 3′-noncoding regions showed a notable sequence identity with those corresponding to the human (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and mouse (33Zgombic-Knight M. Deltour L. Haselbeck R.J. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Genomics. 1997; 41: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) class IV ADH nucleotide sequences, further indicating the correctness of the rat sequence. The 3′-untranslated region contains a putative polyadenylation signal at position 1885 and a poly(A) tail starting at position 2042. Northern blot analysis showed a 2.1-kilobase class IV mRNA for rat stomach (data not shown), which is similar to the size of human (2.3 kilobases) (34Zgombic-Knight M. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4305-4311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and mouse (2.1 kilobases) (35Zgombic-Knight M. Ang H.L. Foglio M.H. Duester G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10868-10877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) class IV mRNAs. Therefore the reported cDNA sequence likely represents the complete rat class IV ADH transcript. The amino acid sequence deduced is identical to that obtained from sequence analysis of the protein (23Parés X. Cederlund E. Moreno A. Hjelmqvist L. Farrés J. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), except for six residue differences. Notably, the first four N-terminal residues (Met-Asp-Thr-Ala) are different from those previously reported (Ser-Asn-Arg-Val), which had been considered tentative because of the fact that the N-terminal residue was blocked by an acetyl group, as in all other mammalian ADHs. Indeed, the present rat N-terminal sequence resembles more closely the human (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and mouse (33Zgombic-Knight M. Deltour L. Haselbeck R.J. Foglio M.H. Duester G. Genomics. 1997; 41: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) class IV ADH sequences except for the presence of an Asp (instead of Gly) following the initiator Met. Asp is quite an unusual residue at this position (mostly Ser, Ala, or Gly) in other ADHs. Human and mouse class IV have a Gly, which implies loosing Met and the subsequent acetylation of the Gly residue. Interestingly, when Met is retained and acetylated, Asp is the predominant penultimate residue found in eukaryotic proteins (36Flinta C. Persson B. Jörnvall H. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 154: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Because the rat protein analysis had revealed that the N terminus contained one additional residue compared with the human class IV enzyme (20Farrés J. Moreno A. Crosas B. Peralba J.M. Allali-Hassani A. Hjelmqvist L. Jörnvall H. Parés X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 549-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Parés X. Cederlund E. Moreno A. Hjelmqvist L. Farrés J. Jörnvall H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1893-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that in rat class IV the initiator Met may be retained and acetylated. The other two observed differences, a Glu for Gly at position 109 and a Val for Ile at position 208, can be explained by single-nucleotide exchanges and may reflect a polymorphism without functional consequences. To produce recombinant human and rat class IV ADHs, their corresponding entire coding sequences were cloned into appropriate expression vectors. No extra amino acid residues were added to the N termini, but in the products prokaryotic formyl-Met is likely to be present, rather than the acetyl-Gly of the human or acetyl-Met of the rat enzymes. The recombinant wild-type and mutant class IV subunits were expressed to similar levels, as assessed from the amount of immunoreactive protein seen in cell homogenates by Western blot analysis. Approximately 1 mg of either enzyme was expressed/10 g of wet weight cells. Both of the two recombinant proteins were soluble, enzymatically active, and were purified to homogeneity following a modification of the methods previously used for the enzymes isolated from stomach tissue. Purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining, and a unique band in the pure fractions was observed. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct several"

https://openalex.org/W1980934665,"The interaction of ligands deemed to be ATP analogues with renal Na(+),K(+)-ATPase suggests that two ATP binding sites coexist on each functional unit. Previous studies in which fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) was used to label the high affinity ATP site and 2'(3')-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)adenosine 5'-diphosphate (TNP-ADP) was used to probe the low affinity site suggested that the two sites coexist on the same alphabeta protomer. Other studies in which FITC labeled the high affinity site and erythrosin-5-isothiocyanate (ErITC) labeled the low affinity site led to the conclusion that the high and low affinity sites exist on separate interacting protomers in a functional diprotomer. We report here that at 100% inhibition of ATPase activity by FITC, each alphabeta protomer of duck nasal gland enzyme has a single bound FITC. Both TNP-ADP and ErITC interact with FITC-bound protomers, which unambiguously demonstrates that putative high and low affinity ATP sites coexist on the same protomer. In unlabeled nasal gland enzyme, TNP-ADP and ErITC inhibit both ATPase activity and p-nitrophenyl phosphatase activity, functions attributed to the putative high and low affinity ATP site, respectively, by interacting with a single site with characteristics of the high affinity ATP binding site. In FITC-labeled enzyme, TNP-ADP and ErITC inhibit p- nitrophenyl phosphatase activity but at much higher concentrations than with the unmodified enzyme. Low affinity sites do not exist on the unmodified enzyme but can be detected only after the high affinity site is modified by FITC."

Intensities correlated inversely with exposure to solvent, and measured and theoretical energy transfer efficiencies agreed well. Function was measured with respect to fibrinogen clotting, platelet and factor V activation, inhibition by antithrombin, and the thrombomodulin-dependent activation of protein C and thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). All activities of W96F and W207F ranged from 74 to 154% of the wild-type activity. This was also true for W148F, except for inhibition by antithrombin, where it showed 60% activity. W60dF was deficient by 30, 57, and 43% with fibrinogen clotting, platelet activation, and factor V cleavage (Arg1006), respectively. W215F was deficient by 90, 55, and 56% with fibrinogen clotting, platelet activation, and factor V cleavage (Arg1536). With protein C and TAFI, W96F, W148F, and W207F were normal. W60dF, however, was 76 and 23% of normal levels with protein C and TAFI, respectively. In contrast, W215F was 25 and 124% of normal levels in these reactions. Thus, many activities of thrombin are retained upon substitution of Trp with Phe at positions 96, 148, and 207. Trp60d, however, appears to be very important for TAFI activation, and Trp215 appears to very important for clotting and protein C activation. Conservative Trp-to-Phe mutations were individually created in human thrombin at positions 60d, 96, 148, 207, and 215. Fluorescence intensities for these residues varied by a factor of 6. Residues 60d, 96, 148, and 215 transferred energy to the thrombin inhibitor 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5- pentanediyl)amide efficiently, but residue 207 did not. Intensities correlated inversely with exposure to solvent, and measured and theoretical energy transfer efficiencies agreed well.

W60dF, however, was 76 and 23% of normal levels with protein C and TAFI, respectively. In contrast, W215F was 25 and 124% of normal levels in these reactions. Thus, many activities of thrombin are retained upon substitution of Trp with Phe at positions 96, 148, and 207.

Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). A principal role of thrombin is to catalyze the cleavage of fibrinogen to produce fibrin (3Blomback B. Blomback M. Hessel B. Iwanaga S. Nature. 1967; 215: 1445-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which spontaneously polymerizes to form the fibrin clot. Thrombin plays several other procoagulant roles, including activating platelets and up-regulating its own production through proteolytic activation of the essential, nonenzymatic cofactors of coagulation, factors V and VIII (4Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1326-1334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Thrombin also stabilizes the newly formed fibrin clot through the activation of factor XIII (6Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E. Fenton J.W., II Blood. 1987; 69: 867-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transglutaminase that introduces isopeptide bonds between fibrin protomers, reinforcing the clot structure. In complex with the endothelial cell-surface protein thrombomodulin, thrombin acts as an anticoagulant through the activation of protein C (7Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and as an attenuator of fibrinolysis through the activation of the plasma carboxypeptidase zymogen TAFI1 (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 9Nesheim M. Wang W. Boffa M. Nagashima M. Morser J. Bajzar L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of thrombin is highly conserved throughout nature. The B-chains of thrombins from 11 vertebrate species share 75% amino acid identity (10Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). When the five known mammalian thrombin sequences are compared, 80% identity is observed. The seven cysteine and nine tryptophan residues in the B-chain of all 11 thrombins are invariant. The crystal structures of thrombin in complex with numerous inhibitors disclose the spatial arrangement of the tryptophan residues (11Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 12Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 23-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Since thrombin is structurally similar to chymotrypsin, the nomenclature of its residues is based on that of chymotrypsin (11Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3467-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Thus, the tryptophan residues of thrombin are designated Trp29, Trp51, Trp60d, Trp96, Trp141, Trp148, Trp207, Trp215, and Trp237. Four of these are intimately associated in space with the active site of thrombin. Trp60d and Trp148 are on loops that surround the active site and presumably control access to it; Trp215 is in the so-called aryl-binding pocket of the active site and lines the S2-binding site; and Trp96is located in the active-site cleft. Trp215 is generally conserved in the family of serine proteases, whereas Trp60dand Trp148 are not. Previous studies indicate that one or more of the tryptophan residues of thrombin are required for activity and are in some way associated with the formation of the active site upon conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. Uhteg and Lundblad (13Uhteg L.C. Lundblad R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 491: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Thompson and Salem (14Thompson E.A. Salem H.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 59: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that limited oxidation of tryptophan residues withN-bromosuccinimide inactivates thrombin for both fibrinogen and small substrates. Other studies have shown that the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin is marked by increases in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (15Silverberg S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8550-8559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 17Côté H.C.F.

Analogous changes in energy transfer from tryptophan residues of (pro)thrombin to the dansyl moiety of the reversible thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA) (18Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) are observed upon prothrombin conversion to thrombin (19Hibbard L.S. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2285-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Boskovic D.S. Giles A.R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10497-10505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, differences in the environments of some of the tryptophan residues exist, as inferred by differences in susceptibility to chemical modification; and changes in environment occur when thrombin is formed from the intermediate prethrombin 2 (16Stevens W.K. Nesheim M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Together, these studies indicate that one or more of the tryptophan residues of thrombin are important in the enzymatic activity of the enzyme and that changes in structure, signaled by changes in intrinsic fluorescence, occur in the vicinity of tryptophan residues upon activation of the zymogen. The following study was undertaken to investigate further the roles of the individual tryptophan residues of thrombin in its enzymatic function and their contributions to fluorescence emission and energy transfer to DAPA. The reversible fluorescent thrombin inhibitor DAPA was synthesized as described previously (18Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Factor V and human factor X were isolated according to previously published procedures (21Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor V (0.2 mg/ml) was activated immediately prior to use by the addition of human α-thrombin to a final concentration of 2 NIH units/ml and incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. Factor X was activated with purified factor X activator from Russell's viper venom, and factor Xa was isolated by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose as described previously (22Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human protein C and TAFI were isolated as described previously (8Bajzar L.

Recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was a generous gift of Dr. John Morser (Berlex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). Templates for PCR mutagenesis of the human prothrombin cDNA were generated by digesting the Bluescript-based plasmid phII (17Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with SstI and PstI (for W60dF, W96F, and W148F) or withPstI and EcoRI (for W208F and W215F) and subcloning the fragments into Bluescript. Mutagenesis was carried out using the procedure described by Nelson and Long (23Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with the primers listed in Table I; oligonucleotides B, C, and D are Bluescript-specific primers for the PCR steps (23Nelson R.M. Long G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The PCR products were purified, cloned into Bluescript, and sequenced. The full-length prothrombin cDNA sequence was regenerated by ligating the mutant fragment with the corresponding wild-type fragments in a multiple part ligation and verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. For expression in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK2-21), the mutant human prothrombin cDNAs were ligated into the pNUT vector, which encodes a modified dihydrofolate reductase gene and allows selection at high methotrexate concentrations (24Palmiter R.D.

Baby hamster kidney cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Cells were transfected with individual pNUT constructs using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (25Searle P.F. Stuart G.W. Palmiter R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1480-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 26Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA (10 μg) was precipitated at pH 6.95 and added to 100-mm plates of baby hamster kidney cells at ∼40% confluence. After 6 h, the cells were rinsed with one change of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 and 5% newborn calf serum and allowed to recover for 2 h before selection was initiated by changing the medium to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 and 5% newborn calf serum containing 0.44 mm methotrexate (David Bull Laboratories, Boucherville, Quebec, Canada). After ∼2 weeks of selection, methotrexate-resistant colonies were subcultured into six-well plates and grown to confluence. The highest expressing clones (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were retained and seeded into triple flasks for large-scale production. After the cells became confluent, the medium was switched to serum-free low protein medium (Opti-MEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with vitamin K1 (10 μg/ml; Abbott Laboratories, Montreal, Quebec) and ZnCl2 (50 μm). The medium was discarded and replaced after 24 h and harvested every other day thereafter. Prothrombin in the conditioned medium (400 ml) was concentrated by slurrying the medium with 15 ml of the anion-exchange resin Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie d'Urfé, Quebec) for 45 min. The mixture was then allowed to settle; the supernatant was decanted; and the resin was transferred to a 20-ml Dispo-Column (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario). The resin was washed with 50 ml of 0.02 m HEPES and 0.15m NaCl (pH 7.4), and the adsorbed prothrombin was eluted with 0.02 m HEPES and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.4). Following dilution with 0.02 m HEPES to a final salt concentration of 0.15 m, the prothrombin in the media concentrate was activated to thrombin. The thrombin was then purified, and the active-site titer was determined as described previously (27Stevens W.K. Côté H.C.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8062-8067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The absorbances of wild-type thrombin and the various mutants were read at 280 and 300 nm. The pH was then adjusted to 12 with a small aliquot of 5 n NaOH, and the absorbances were again read (to the fourth place after the decimal) with a Perkin-Elmer λ6 spectrophotometer. The measurement at 280 nm (pH 7.4) represented primarily tryptophan residues, and the increment that occurred at 300 nm upon increasing the pH specifically measured the tyrosine content of the proteins (28Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). The measurements of tyrosine indicated that each of the measured tryptophan residues contributes 9.7 ± 3.3% of the absorbance at 280 nm. Thus, the assumption was made that all nine residues contribute equally to the absorbance, as with other proteins (29Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar, 30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar); and the concentrations of the mutants were calculated from the absorbances at 280 nm, with the extinction coefficient adjusted for the loss of one tryptophan residue. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected between 290 and 500 nm with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm and a 290-nm cutoff filter in the emission beam. The protein concentration was typically 40 nm in the cuvette. Spectra were then normalized to the same protein concentration. The spectra of the individual residues were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the corresponding mutant from that of wild-type thrombin. To determine whether the difference measurements might be confounded by changes in the extents of Trp-Trp or Trp-Tyr energy transfer in wild-type compared with mutant thrombins, theoretical energy transfers for all possible pairs in thrombin were calculated from the distances between them and their orientations provided by the x-ray structure (Protein Data Bank code 1FPC). 2I. I. Matthews and A. Tulinsky, unpublished data. Remarkably, only two non-zero values for energy transfer were calculated despite the presence of nine tryptophan and 14 tyrosine residues in the molecule. The non-zero values were for the pairs Trp29/Trp207 and Trp51/Trp237, where efficiencies of 0.49 and 0.05 were calculated, respectively. To determine the extent of energy transfer from each residue to the dansylated, active site-directed inhibitor( DAPA), it was added to a final concentration of 5.0 μm, and the spectral analyses were repeated. Efficiencies of transfer (E) were calculated by the equationE = 1 − I(+DAPA)/I(−DAPA), where I(+DAPA) is the integrated intensity of a given residue in the presence of DAPA and I(−DAPA) is the intensity in its absence. To assure saturation at 5.0 μmDAPA, wild-type thrombin and each of the variants were titrated with DAPA, and the decrements in tryptophan emission at 340 nm were measured after each addition of DAPA. The data (ΔI, [DAPA]) were fit to the equation ΔI = I0 − ΔImax·[DAPA]/(Kd + [DAPA]) by nonlinear regression to determine theKd values for the binding of DAPA to the various forms of thrombin. I0 is the initial intensity in the absence of DAPA. Theoretical energy transfer efficiencies from several of the tryptophan residues to the dansyl moiety of DAPA were also calculated (31Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 303-340Crossref Google Scholar) from the orientations and distances provided by the crystal structure of the thrombin-DAPA complex,2 the respective emission and absorption transition dipoles of tryptophan (32Callis P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 113-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and the dansyl moiety (33Nowak W. Rettig W. J. Mol. Struct. ( Theochem ). 1993; 283: 1-12Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and the Forster distance for the pair (21 Å) (34Steinberg I.Z. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1971; 40: 83-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Samples (100 μl) of wild-type or mutant thrombins were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in the wells of a microtiter plate, and an aliquot (150 μl) of 0.5 mm S2238 (d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanaline dihydrochloride) was added. The rates of change of absorbance at 405 nm were determined. Esterolytic assays using TAME were carried out in 0.05m Tris and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 8.1) at 22 °C. The thrombin sample (30 μl) was pipetted into 870 μl of the assay buffer and incubated for 2 min, and 100 μl of 0.1 m TAME was added and mixed. The absorbance at 247 nm was determined at 45-s intervals, and the initial rates of TAME hydrolysis were determined. To determine clotting activity, aliquots (100 μl) of various dilutions (5–160 nm) of wild-type and mutant thrombins were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and a 100-μl aliquot of a solution of 2 mg/ml human fibrinogen in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, and 10 mm Ca2+ (pH 7.4) was added. The clotting times were measured by turbidity in a microtiter plate reader. Plots of the logarithms of the clotting timeversus the logarithms of the thrombin concentrations were prepared. The plots were linear, and all thrombins gave the same slope. The clotting activities of the mutants, relative to wild-type thrombin, were measured from the displacements of the mutant lines on the concentration axis. The ability of fibrinogen to act as a competitive substrate was analyzed by measurements of the steady-state kinetics of the hydrolysis of the synthetic peptide p-nitroanilide substrate S2366 (l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride). Solutions (200 μl) consisting of 0.02 mHEPES, 0.02 m sodium pyrophosphate, 0.15 mNaCl, and 0.01% Tween 80 (pH 7.4) with S2366 at various concentrations with and without fibrinogen (2.5, 5.0, or 10 μm) were pipetted into wells of a microtiter plate that had been presoaked with 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 80 (pH 7.4) for 1 h and then emptied (to minimize protein adsorption). The plate was placed in a plate reader thermostatted at 22 °C. Base-line absorbances were measured, and the reactions were initiated with a small aliquot of recombinant wild-type or mutant thrombins (final concentration of 5.0 nm). The reaction progress was monitored at 405 nm, and the initial rates of the reactions were calculated utilizing an extinction coefficient of 9951m−1 cm−1for p-nitroaniline (35Lottenberg R. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rate data were globally fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition by nonlinear regression (SYSTAT) with rate, [S2366], and [fibrinogen] as variables and kcat, Km, andKI (Km for fibrinogen) as optimized parameters. The rate equation was as follows: rate =kcat[thrombin][S2366]/(Km(1 + [fibrinogen]/KI) + [S2366]). Washed human platelets were prepared by a modification of the method of Mustard et al. (36Mustard J.F. Perry D.W. Ardlie N.G. Packham M.A. Br. J. Haematol. 1972; 22 (abstr.): 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) as described previously (17Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet counts were determined with a Baker System 9000 cell counter. They were kept at 37 °C and used within 1.5 h of preparation. The thrombin concentration dependence of aggregation was determined for wild-type and mutant thrombins. Platelet aggregation was measured in siliconized glass cuvettes in an aggregometer. Gain settings were adjusted to give 100% transmittance for the buffer and 0% for the platelet suspension prior to the addition of thrombin. The platelet concentration was 1 × 108/ml, and the buffer was HEPES/Tyrode's solution/albumin and 5 mm CaCl2 (17Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of aggregation was taken as the slope of absorbance versus time plot. A 2.5-ml solution of single chain bovine factor V (100 μg/ml) in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, and 5.0 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.4) was placed at 22 °C in a Perkin-Elmer λ50B spectrofluorometer. Light scattering at right angles (λex = λem= 320 nm) was monitored continuously. After determining the initial intensity value, thrombin (3.54 nm) was added, and cleavage to smaller species was monitored over time by the decrease in scattering intensity. Samples (50 μl) were removed at 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, 2, 5, 10, and 15 min after adding thrombin. Each was immediately added to 2 μl of 10 μmd-phenylalanylarginyl chloromethyl ketone to stop the reaction and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and laser densitometry. Factor V activation occurs in response to cleavages at Arg1006, Arg713, and Arg1536, in this order (21Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 37Guinto E.R. Esmon C.T. Mann K.G. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2971-2978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first cleavage generates intermediates that do not dissociate (38Nesheim M.E. Foster W.B. Hewick R. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3187-3196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the second occurs in the lighter intermediate to yield the heavy chain of factor Va and to liberate an activation peptide; and the third occurs in the heavier intermediate to yield the light chain of factor Va and to liberate the second activation peptide. Thus, factor V (FV) conversion to factor Va (FVa) was modeled according to three sequential reactions through two intermediates, as indicated in Reaction 1. FV→k1FVI1→k2FVI2→k3FVaREACTION I Although the first step cannot be visualized by light scattering because no fragments are released, the last two each involve release of an activation fragment and are therefore signaled by a decrement in light scattering. Since k1 was not accessible by light scattering, its value was deduced from the time course of cleavage of factor V itself as monitored by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. For wild-type thrombin and each of the mutants, values ofk2 and k3 were inferred by nonlinear regression of the light scattering time course. The regression equation had three exponential terms plus a constant for the final scattering value when the reactions were over. The five best fit parameters were k1, k2,k3, and the scattering intensities of FVI (1Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) and FVI (2Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) relative to that of FV. In these analyses, the value of the coefficient for the first exponential (k1) was fixed at the value measured by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. The ability of human antithrombin, isolated as described previously (39Nesheim M.E. Blackburn M.N. Lawler C.M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3214-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit wild-type and mutant thrombins was analyzed by incubating thrombin (6.67 nm) with antithrombin (250, 500, 750, or 1000 nm) at 22 °C in 0.05 m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 80 (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 200 μl. At regular intervals, 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn and added to 190 μl of 0.4 m S2238, and the absorbance at 405 nm was monitored over time to determine residual thrombin activity. The pseudo first-order rate constants for decay of thrombin were determined from slopes of ln(activity) versus time. Second-order rate constants were then determined from slopes of plots of the pseudo first-order rate constants versus the antithrombin concentration. Human protein C (final concentration of 0.1–2.0 μm) and recombinant soluble thrombomodulin (final concentration of 60 nm) were combined in 0.02m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5.0 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.4) in a total volume of 40 μl in presoaked wells of a microtiter plate. Reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of a solution of wild-type or mutant thrombins (final concentration of 1 nm). Ten minutes later, the reactions were quenched by adding 140 μl of a solution of DAPA (40.6 μm), S2366 (0.43 mm), and EDTA (10 mm) in 0.02m HEPES and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4). The absorbance at 405 nm was then measured at 1-min intervals for 30 min. Initial rates of 2366 hydrolysis were converted to activated protein C concentrations based on a standard curve made with activated protein C. Rates of protein C activation were then calculated, and data were fit by nonlinear regression (SYSTAT) to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine the best values of Km andkcat. TAFI (0.0–2.0 μm) was incubated with wild-type and mutant thrombins (1.0 nm) and soluble thrombomodulin (50 nm) at 22 °C in 0.02m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 5.0 mmCaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 80 in a total volume of 20 μl in presoaked wells of a microtiter plate. After 10 min, reactions were quenched by adding 180 μl of a solution ofd-phenylalanylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (20 nm) and the carboxypeptidase B substrate furfuroylacryloylalaninylarginine (500 μm) in the same buffer. TAFIa concentrations were then deduced from the initial rates of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Experiments with mutant W60dF were repeated with thrombomodulin concentrations of 6.12, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 nm. All rate data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression (SYSTAT) as described previously (8Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar,40Boffa M."

https://openalex.org/W2058767234,"Abstract Factor VIIIa is a trimer of the A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits. Regions in the A2 subunit that interact with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer were localized using synthetic peptides derived from A2 sequences showing high probability of being surface exposed. Peptides were restricted to residues 373–562 of A2 based on the earlier observation that this region of A2 reacts with A1 using a zero length cross-linker. Peptides were assessed for their capacity to inhibit the reconstitution of factor VIIIa from the isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit. Reconstitution was monitored using both regeneration of factor VIIIa activity and fluorescence quenching of an acrylodan-labeled A2 (Ac-A2) by fluorescein-labeled A1/A3-C1-C2. The activity assay identified four peptides as inhibitors, residues 373–395 (IC50 = 65 μm), 418–428 (IC50 = 25 μm), 482–493 (IC50 = 325 μm), and 518–533 (IC50 = 585 μm). The 373–395 and 518–533 peptides eliminated the fluorescence quenching of Ac-A2, whereas the 418–428 peptide reduced but did not eliminate Ac-A2 quenching. Peptide 482–493 had no effect on the fluorescence quenching of Ac-A2 suggesting that the peptide did not directly affect reassociation of the factor VIIIa subunits. These results identify three regions in the A2 subunit (373–395, 418–428, and 518–533) that interact with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. Furthermore, comparison of results obtained using the two assays distinguish inhibition of the intersubunit interactions from intermolecular interactions."
