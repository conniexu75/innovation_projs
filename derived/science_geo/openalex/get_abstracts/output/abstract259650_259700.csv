https://openalex.org/W2151041036,"Plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling coordinates nuclear gene expression with chloroplast function and is essential for the photoautotrophic life-style of plants. Three retrograde signals have been described, but little is known of their signaling pathways. We show here that GUN1, a chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide-repeat protein, and ABI4, an Apetala 2 (AP2)–type transcription factor, are common to all three pathways. ABI4 binds the promoter of a retrograde-regulated gene through a conserved motif found in close proximity to a light-regulatory element. We propose a model in which multiple indicators of aberrant plastid function in Arabidopsis are integrated upstream of GUN1 within plastids, which leads to ABI4-mediated repression of nuclear-encoded genes."

We reasoned that well-established chiral amine catalysis, which activates aldehydes toward electrophile addition by enamine formation, could be expanded to this important reaction class by applying a single-electron oxidant to create a transient radical species from the enamine. We demonstrated the concept of singly occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) activation with a highly selective α-allylation of aldehydes, and we here present preliminary results for enantioselective heteroarylations and cyclization/halogenation cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1999567494,"Attention can be focused volitionally by “top-down” signals derived from task demands and automatically by “bottom-up” signals from salient stimuli. The frontal and parietal cortices are involved, but their neural activity has not been directly compared. Therefore, we recorded from them simultaneously in monkeys. Prefrontal neurons reflected the target location first during top-down attention, whereas parietal neurons signaled it earlier during bottom-up attention. Synchrony between frontal and parietal areas was stronger in lower frequencies during top-down attention and in higher frequencies during bottom-up attention. This result indicates that top-down and bottom-up signals arise from the frontal and sensory cortex, respectively, and different modes of attention may emphasize synchrony at different frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2060515857,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are genomically encoded small RNAs used by organisms to regulate the expression of proteins generated from messenger RNA transcripts. The in vivo requirement of specific miRNAs in mammals through targeted deletion remains unknown, and reliable prediction of mRNA targets is still problematic. Here, we show that miRNA biogenesis in the mouse heart is essential for cardiogenesis. Furthermore, targeted deletion of the muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1-2, revealed numerous functions in the heart, including regulation of cardiac morphogenesis, electrical conduction, and cell-cycle control. Analyses of miR-1 complementary sequences in mRNAs upregulated upon miR-1-2 deletion revealed an enrichment of miR-1 “seed matches” and a strong tendency for potential miR-1 binding sites to be located in physically accessible regions. These findings indicate that subtle alteration of miRNA dosage can have profound consequences in mammals and demonstrate the utility of mammalian loss-of-function models in revealing physiologic miRNA targets."

As abundances of all 11 great sharks that consume other elasmobranchs (rays, skates, and small sharks) fell over the past 35 years, 12 of 14 of these prey species increased in coastal northwest Atlantic ecosystems. Effects of this community restructuring have cascaded downward from the cownose ray, whose enhanced predation on its bay scallop prey was sufficient to terminate a century-long scallop fishery. Analogous top-down effects may be a predictable consequence of eliminating entire functional groups of predators."

https://openalex.org/W1970048015,"An unusually large expansion upon solvent adsorption occurs without apparent bond breaking in the network of a series of isoreticular chromium(III) or iron(III) diarboxylates labeled MIL-88A to D [dicarbox = fumarate (88A); terephthalate (1,4-BDC) (88B); 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (2,6-NDC) (88C); and 4-4′-biphenyldicarboxylate (4-4′-BPDC) (88D)]. This reversible “breathing” motion was analyzed in terms of cell dimensions (extent of breathing), movements within the framework (mechanism of transformation), and the interactions between the guests and the skeleton. In situ techniques show that these flexible solids are highly selective absorbents and that this selectivity is strongly dependent on the nature of the organic linker."
https://openalex.org/W1987205608,"A marine ecosystem model seeded with many phytoplankton types, whose physiological traits were randomly assigned from ranges defined by field and laboratory data, generated an emergent community structure and biogeography consistent with observed global phytoplankton distributions. The modeled organisms included types analogous to the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus . Their emergent global distributions and physiological properties simultaneously correspond to observations. This flexible representation of community structure can be used to explore relations between ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, and climate change."

We have purified human telomerase approximately 10(8)-fold, with the final elution dependent on the enzyme's ability to catalyze nucleotide addition onto a DNA oligonucleotide of telomeric sequence, thereby providing specificity for catalytically active telomerase. Mass spectrometric sequencing of the protein components and molecular size determination indicated an enzyme composition of two molecules each of telomerase reverse transcriptase, telomerase RNA, and dyskerin."
https://openalex.org/W2069053606,"Plate tectonic processes introduce basaltic crust (as eclogite) into the peridotitic mantle. The proportions of these two sources in mantle melts are poorly understood. Silica-rich melts formed from eclogite react with peridotite, converting it to olivine-free pyroxenite. Partial melts of this hybrid pyroxenite are higher in nickel and silicon but poorer in manganese, calcium, and magnesium than melts of peridotite. Olivine phenocrysts' compositions record these differences and were used to quantify the contributions of pyroxenite-derived melts in mid-ocean ridge basalts (10 to 30%), ocean island and continental basalts (many >60%), and komatiites (20 to 30%). These results imply involvement of 2 to 20% (up to 28%) of recycled crust in mantle melting."
https://openalex.org/W2163785511,"We hypothesized that in addition to serving as a fuel source and gluconeogenic precursor, lactate anion (La-) is a signaling molecule. Therefore, we screened genome-wide responses of L6 cells to elevated (10 and 20 mM) sodium-La- added to buffered, high-glucose media. Lactate increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and up-regulated 673 genes, many known to be responsive to ROS and Ca2+. The induction of genes encoding for components of the mitochondrial lactate oxidation complex was confirmed by independent methods (PCR and EMSA). Specifically, lactate increased monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) mRNA and protein expression within 1 h and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) mRNA and protein expression in 6 h. Increases in COX coincided with increases in peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC1alpha) expression and the DNA binding activity of nuclear respiratory factor (NRF)-2. We conclude that the lactate signaling cascade involves ROS production and converges on transcription factors affecting mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1988760595,"Inflammation under sterile conditions is not well understood despite its importance in trauma and autoimmune disease. To investigate this process we established mouse models of sterile injury and explored the role of hyaluronan in mediating inflammation following injury. The response of cultured monocytes to hyaluronan was different than the response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) despite both being dependent on Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Cultured cells exposed to hyaluronan showed a pattern of gene induction that mimics the response seen in mouse skin after sterile injury with an increase in molecules such as transforming growth factor-β2 and matrix metalloproteinase-13. These factors were not induced by LPS despite the mutual dependence of both hyaluronan and LPS on TLR4. Explanation for the unique response to hyaluronan was provided by observations that a lack of TLR4 or CD44 in mice diminished the response to sterile injury, and together with MD-2, was required for responsiveness to hyaluronan in vitro. Thus, a unique complex of TLR4, MD-2, and CD44 recognizes hyaluronan. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the physical association of TLR4 and CD44. Taken together, our results define a previously unknown mechanism for initiation of sterile inflammation that involves recognition of released hyaluronan fragments as an endogenous signal of tissue injury.

Inflammation, as defined by changes in vascular permeability and leukocyte recruitment, is an essential step for the control of microbial invasion. Specific microbial products trigger this process through a diverse array of innate immune pattern recognition receptors. However, an inflammatory response is also important for processes independent of infection. For example, normal wound healing requires a controlled inflammatory response to enable the recruitment of monocytes and the release of growth factors required for repair. This response can be observed in the absence of microbial stimuli. Conversely, inflammation is associated with negative outcomes in many diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn disease, that are not due to infection (13Beutler B. Nature. 2004; 430: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). These diseases are not well understood in terms of their triggers, but rather are described by the subsequent release of pro-inflammatory mediators. Identification of the triggers of sterile inflammation represents an important goal with immediate diagnostic and therapeutic significance. Among the best-studied microbial elements responsible for triggering the host inflammatory response is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; WFGAG, wound fluid GAG; HA, hyaluronan; sHA, small molecular weight HA fragment; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TGF, transforming growth factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; IL-8, interleukin-8; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MIP-2, macrophage inflammatory protein-2. This is a major component of Gram-negative bacteria and is an extrinsic pathogen-associated molecule recognized by host Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) (1Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y.

The ability of LPS to signal through TLR4 requires the presence of several accessory molecules, including LPS-binding protein (2Schumann R.R. Leong S.R. Flaggs G.W. Gray P.W. Wright S.D.

Following engagement of TLR4 with an appropriate co-accessory molecule, signaling occurs through Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-like domain-containing MyD88 (8Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K.

These signaling pathways lead to the activation of a variety of components vital for resistance to infection and associated with inflammation, including antimicrobial peptides, interleukins, cytokines, chemokines, and tumor necrosis factor (13Beutler B.

Recently, the glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) has also been identified as an inducer of TLR4 activation, capable of causing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (18Termeer C. Benedix F.

It has been suggested that trauma can release small molecular weight HA fragments (sHA) from the extracellular matrix, thus potentially presenting HA as an intrinsic signal of inflammation. In support of this hypothesis are observations that inflammation following chemical injury by bleomycin is altered in mice deficient in either MyD88 or TLR4/TLR2 (21Jiang D. Liang J. Fan J. Yu S. Chen S. Luo Y. Prestwich G.D. Mascarenhas M.M. Garg H.G. Quinn D.A. Homer R.J. Goldstein D.R. Bucala R. Lee P.J. Medzhitov R. Noble P.W. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1173-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). This model results in release of HA but also is available to respiratory microbes, therefore complicating interpretations and analysis of the elements involved in the initial trigger and response systems. We sought to develop mouse models of sterile injury to determine innate elements that recognize and mediate sterile inflammation. Our results demonstrate that the initiation of a sterile intrinsic inflammatory process is dependent on TLR4 activation and resembles signaling events that are activated by HA. Furthermore, a novel alternative recognition complex is defined, involving the contribution of TLR4, MD-2, and CD44. Additionally, this unique receptor complex and downstream signaling events specific to the injury response alter the host's ability to respond to subsequent sepsis induced by LPS activation. These observations provide new insight into the mechanisms responsible for sterile inflammation. The mouse alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, catalog CRL-2019). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), and 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The human monocyte THP-1 cell line was purchased from ATCC (catalog TIB-202). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2.25 g of glucose. Non-transfected HEK293 cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-1573) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively). HEK293 cells transfected with TLR4 and TLR4/MD-2 were a generous gift from Dr. Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts, School of Medicine) and have been described previously (22Latz E. Visintin A. Lien E. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Golenbock D.T. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47834-47843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (plus l-glutamine and 4.5 g/liter glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.5 μg/ml G-418, and 10 μg/ml ciprofloxacin. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were isolated from the tibia and femur of euthanized mice by culturing bone marrow cells in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with l-glutamine, 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively), 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5 ng/ml macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Selection media were changed every other day for a total of 7 days. Experiments on bone marrow-derived macrophages were performed on day 7. Human umbilical cord hyaluronan was purchased from Sigma. Small 1-ml HA batches were boiled for 1 h to inactivate any enzyme or protein contamination. Samples were then run on two endotoxin-removal columns (Associates of Cape Cod) sequentially to remove any possibility of endotoxin contamination. HA preparations were free of DNA contamination, as preparations showed no peaks at 260 and 280 nm using a Spectrometer. LPS was obtained from LIST Biologics, Inc., and Sigma. Cells were grown to confluence in a 96-well flat bottom plate (Costar). If experiments were performed in low serum media conditions as indicated, then their growth medium was removed and replaced the night before the experiment with low serum-containing medium. For the experiment, medium was removed from the cells and replaced with medium containing either HA or LPS at the indicated concentrations. Cells were allowed to incubate with the described condition for a specific time point, medium was then removed and spun down at 1000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any debris. Cell medium was stored at –20 °C until analysis. Models of Sterile Inflammation—Balb/c, TLR4–/– (C3H/HeJ), and TLR4+/+ controls, and CD44–/– (Cd44tm1Hbg) and CD44+/+ controls were all purchased from Jackson Laboratories. For bead injection, 0.5 mg of Cytodex microcarrier beads (Sigma) was placed in 25 ml of sterile, endotoxin-free PBS, maintained in sterile conditions, and autoclaved. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and fur was plucked from the back area and wiped with an ethanol pad. 250 μl of Cytodex bead slurry was injected subcutaneously into the back space using a sterile 25-gauge needle and sterile 1-ml syringe, creating a large bubble in the skin. After a specified time point, mice were euthanized by over-anesthesia with halothane, and an 8-mm punch biopsy was used to isolate skin regions, either injured sites or non-injured sites on the backs of the mice. The skin sections were placed in a tube with 500 μl of 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (and protease inhibitors) and 2.4-mm Zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) and were beaten in a mini-bead beater apparatus (BioSpec Products, Inc.) for 50 s on full speed. Extracts were then sonicated for 5 min on ice and spun down at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and kept at –20 °C until analysis by MIP-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For the liquid nitrogen sterile inflammation model, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and back fur was plucked. A CRY-AC liquid nitrogen dispenser with a 1-mm nozzle (Brymill Cryogenic Systems, Ellington, CT) was used to administer a steady liquid nitrogen 1-cm diameter circle to the mouse back for 15 s. This provided a frozen injury that was kept frozen for a full 60 s. After a specified time point, mice were euthanized by over-anesthesia with halothane, and a 8-mm punch biopsy was used to isolate skin regions, either injured sites or non-injured sites on the backs of the mice. Skin extracts were processed exactly as described above for the bead model of sterile injury. Animal procedures were approved by the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System subcommittee on animal studies, protocol 02-037. HA Staining following Sterile Skin Injury—To determine if HA accumulates following injury, mice were anesthetized, and injury was induced by injecting 250 μl of Cytodex beads as described earlier. After the specified time, mice were euthanized, and an 8-mm punch biopsy was used to remove both non-injured and injured skin. Skin was embedded in OCT compound and frozen at –20 °C. Sections (7 μm thick) were cut, and staining was carried out according to the protocol using Pep-1 described by Zmolik et al. (23Zmolik J.M. Mummert M.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Pep-1 was synthesized as previously described (19Taylor K.R. Trowbridge J.M. Rudisill J.A. Termeer C.C. Simon J.C. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17079-17084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunofluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX41 fluorescence microscope (Scientific Instrument Co., Temecula, CA). Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy, Gottigen, Germany) coupled with an Axiovert 100 (Carl Zeiss) inverted stage microscope. To determine the expression of MMP-13 and TGF-β2 following injury, mice were anesthetized and 250 μl of Cytodex beads was injected into a site on their backs as described above. After an indicated time, the mouse was euthanized, and an 8-mm punch biopsy was used to remove both a non-injured skin site and the bead-induced injury site. Each skin section was placed in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and 2.4-mm Zirconia beads as described above. Each sample was beaten in a mini-bead beater apparatus, as described above, for 50 s on full speed. To extract RNA, 200 μl of chloroform was added to each tube and was mixed vigorously by hand for 15 s, and the mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 3 min. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min, 12,000 × g at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, 500 μl of 100% isopropanol was added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g, 4 °C. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol, vortexed, and then centrifuged at 7500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was dried and then dissolved in RNase-free H2O, and concentration was determined by spectrometry at 260 nm. Real-time PCR was used to determine the induction of Mmp13 and Tgfb2 following sterile injury. cDNA was synthesized from RNA by the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used to analyze for Mmp13 and Tgfb2 expression as described by the manufacturer. Gapdh or 18 S ribosomal RNA controls was used to normalize for each sample. Wound fluid GAG was isolated as previously described by anion exchange from human wound fluid (24Penc S.F. Pomahac B. Winkler T. Dorschner R.A. Eriksson E. Herndon M. Gallo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28116-28121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, where previous elutions of GAG have occurred at 2 m NaCl, WFGAG in these experiments was eluted from 0.75 to 1 m NaCl as to enrich for less sulfated GAG populations that would include HA. The presence of HA and approximate concentration in wound fluid was determined by dot blot using a known HA standard for comparison and HA-binding protein (Seikagaku Corp.) for detection. To digest WFGAG preparations, as well as stock HA, chondroitin sulfate, and dermatan sulfate for comparison, all GAG samples were lyophilized and resuspended in digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 60 mm sodium acetate, and 0.02% bovine serum albumin). The chondroitinase ABC enzyme at pH 6.8 will preferentially digest HA over chondroitin sulfate and is a relatively neutral pH for further in vitro cell culture experiments. 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) was added to each digest, and buffer was added to no-digest controls. Samples were digested overnight at 37 °C, and then boiled for 3 min to inhibit enzyme activity. Samples were reconstituted with cell media to achieve the desired concentration and added to cells to determine activity as described in cell stimulation experiments in vitro. MH-S macrophages were incubated with 25 μg/ml HA, 50 ng/ml LPS, or vehicle control for 6 h in 100-mm dishes at 37 °C. After incubation, total RNA was prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol and reagents. The experiment was repeated on three different occasions, isolating RNA for each condition to have triplicate RNA samples. RNA was submitted to the SDVA Microarray Core Facility for biochemistry, and image analysis was carried out according to Affymetrix Standards and the MIAME checklist. Affymetrix mouse 2.0A arrays were utilized where vehicle control chips were compared with triplicate HA- and LPS-treated chips. Data were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Operating Software and Agilent Technologies GeneSpring 7.0. Experimental HA and LPS chips were normalized to vehicle control chips, and data were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance comparing treatment type, with p value cutoff of 0.05.

MH-S macrophage cells were stimulated with 25 μg/ml HA, 50 ng/ml LPS, and vehicle control for 10 min and extracted in 1× radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Cells were placed on ice, scraped, and transferred to a 1.5-ml tube. Cells were sonicated for 20 min on ice and then spun down at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysate was transferred to a clean tube and stored at –20 °C. Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 500 μg of total protein was pre-cleared with 0.25 μg of control IgG antibody and 20 μl of Protein A/G-Plus agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C while rotating. Beads were pelleted by centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C, and lysate was removed and placed in a new tube. To the pre-cleared cell lysate, 2 μg of rat anti-mouse CD44 primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C rotating for 2 h. Twenty microliters of Protein A/G-Plus agarose was added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C while rotating. Beads were pelleted by centrifuging at 2500 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, spinning down as described after each wash. After the last wash, the supernatant was removed and beads were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer for Western blotting. For control experiments, IgG antibody (Pierce) and EGFR antibody (BD Biosciences) were used at 2 μg to verify that the immunoprecipitation using CD44 and probing for TLR4 was specific. Samples were boiled for 3 min and loaded onto a 10% Tris-Tricine gel (BioExpress) along with 5 μl of biotinylated protein ladder (Cell Signaling Technology). Gels were run for 2 h at 60 V and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk/3% bovine serum albumin in 1× PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse TLR4 antibody (dilution 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in block solution for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with TBST (0.3% Tween 20 in TBS) and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:5000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in block solution for 30 min at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with TBST and then developed with Western Lightning Chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Alternatively, the same protocol described above was done in the reverse. Following a pre-clear with IgG antibody, 2 μg of TLR4/MD-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody was added to the lysate, and the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and then with 20 μl of Protein A/G-Plus agarose overnight at 4 °C. As described above, 2 μg of antibody control as well as 2 μg of EGFR antibody were used as controls to verify that the immunoprecipitation was specific. Gels were run as described above, and Western blot was carried out using rat anti-mouse CD44 antibody (dilution 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody used for detection was a goat anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To evaluate the effect of MD2 on the interaction between CD44 and TLR4, non-transfected HEK293 cells, TLR4-transfected HEK293 cells, or TLR4/MD2-transfected HEK293 cells (22Latz E. Visintin A.

Following a pre-clear with IgG antibody, 2 μg of TLR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody was added to lysates, the mixture was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, and then 20 μl of Protein A/G-Plus agarose was added overnight at 4 °C. Gels were run as described above, and Western blotting was performed using a rat anti-mouse CD44 antibody (dilution 1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibody used for detection was a goat anti-rat IgG horseradish peroxidase (dilution 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The University of California San Diego MS-Isotope analysis program was then used as a tool for calculating the predicted molecular weight of known CD44 splice variants to verify the corresponding band. MH-S macrophage cells were grown to sub-confluency on 8-well chamber slides (Nunc International). Cells were rinsed once with media and then incubated with 25 μg/ml HA, 50 ng/ml LPS, or vehicle control for indicated time points at 37 °C. Media was removed, and cells were rinsed once with PBS and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with appropriate serum for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies rat anti-mouse CD44 (clone IM7) and goat anti-mouse TLR4 (L-14) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology at the recommended concentrations (1:50 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Antibodies were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Following primary antibody, cells were washed three times with PBS, and two secondary antibodies, anti-goat-IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate and anti-rat-IgG-R (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in a dark humidified chamber. Cells were washed three times with PBS, the chamber was removed from the slide, and cells were fixed with Prolong anti-fade reagent (Invitrogen) and a coverslip. Immunofluorescence was observed using an Olympus BX41 fluorescence microscope (Scientific Instrument Co.). Confocal images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Light Microscopy, Gottigen, Germany) coupled with an Axiovert 100 (Carl Zeiss) inverted stage microscope. Results are generally expressed as the mean ± S.D. and are representative of at least three separate experiments. A paired t test was used to determine significance unless otherwise stated. For the mouse in vivo experiments, a two-way analysis of variance was used for behavioral experiment and one-way analysis of variance was used for sterile injury; these were analyzed by Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Induction of MIP-2 by Sterile Injury and HA Is Dependent on TLR4—To study both the triggers and recognition elements of sterile injury, it was first necessary to develop sterile models that could be rapidly evaluated following trauma. Two complementary models were developed in mice to accomplish this with minimal risk from extrinsic microbial stimuli.

This study demonstrates that skeleton-producing corals grown in acidified experimental conditions are able to sustain basic life functions, including reproductive ability, in a sea anemone‐like form and will resume skeleton building when reintroduced to normal modern marine conditions. These results support the existence of physiological refugia, allowing corals to alternate between nonfossilizing soft-body ecophenotypes and fossilizing skeletal forms in response to changes in ocean chemistry. This refugia, however, does not undermine the threats to reef ecosystems in a high carbon dioxide world."
https://openalex.org/W2050749891,"A variety of methods exist for the design or selection of antibodies and other proteins that recognize the water-soluble regions of proteins; however, companion methods for targeting transmembrane (TM) regions are not available. Here, we describe a method for the computational design of peptides that target TM helices in a sequence-specific manner. To illustrate the method, peptides were designed that specifically recognize the TM helices of two closely related integrins (α IIb β 3 and α v β 3 ) in micelles, bacterial membranes, and mammalian cells. These data show that sequence-specific recognition of helices in TM proteins can be achieved through optimization of the geometric complementarity of the target-host complex."

https://openalex.org/W2002704244,"We used three-dimensional inverse scattering of core-reflected shear waves for large-scale, high-resolution exploration of Earth's deep interior (D″) and detected multiple, piecewise continuous interfaces in the lowermost layer (D″) beneath Central and North America. With thermodynamic properties of phase transitions in mantle silicates, we interpret the images and estimate in situ temperatures. A widespread wave-speed increase at 150 to 300 kilometers above the coremantle boundary is consistent with a transition from perovskite to postperovskite. Internal D″ stratification may be due to multiple phase-boundary crossings, and a deep wave-speed reduction may mark the base of a postperovskite lens about 2300 kilometers wide and 250 kilometers thick. The core-mantle boundary temperature is estimated at 3950 ± 200 kelvin. Beneath Central America, a site of deep subduction, the D″ is relatively cold (ΔT = 700 ± 100 kelvin). Accounting for a factor-of-two uncertainty in thermal conductivity, core heat flux is 80 to 160 milliwatts per square meter (mW m –2 ) into the coldest D″ region and 35 to 70 mW m –2 away from it. Combined with estimates from the central Pacific, this suggests a global average of 50 to 100 mW m –2 and a total heat loss of 7.5 to 15 terawatts."

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays pivotal roles in developmental processes and diseases (1Nusse R. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Wnt proteins are secreted and lipid-modified molecules (2Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates III, J.R. Nusse R.

Depending on the cell type and receptor complement present, Wnt proteins can activate the “canonical” β-catenin-dependent signaling or β-catenin-independent signaling, including the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway and the planar cell polarity pathway (3Strutt D. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 4501-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The canonical Wnt signaling operates via stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin.

Spatially and temporally regulated expression of these molecules, together with the receptor complement in specific tissues, likely accomplishes the critical roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in both embryonic development and maintaining of homeostasis in adult tissues. A novel family of secreted molecules, referred to as R-spondin (roof plate-specific spondin) (29Kamata T. Katsube K. Michikawa M. Yamada M. Takada S. Mizusawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev.

Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Four R-spondin proteins (Rspo1-4) exist in vertebrates, which do not bear sequence similarity to the Wnt family of proteins. Rspo1 was identified as a gene in mouse that is expressed in the developing spinal cord, and its expression requires Wnt activities (29Kamata T. Katsube K. Michikawa M. Yamada M. Takada S. Mizusawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, Rspo2 was isolated in a functional cDNA expression screen for molecules that can activate a TCF/β-catenin-dependent reporter expression in HEK293T cells (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Like in mouse, Xenopus R-spondin genes are often co-expressed with and induced by Wnt genes during embryogenesis. Human Rspo1 (hRspo1) was identified by virtue of its ability to promote, upon overexpression in transgenic mice, robust proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (31Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y. Boyle B. Park E. Emtage P. Funk W.D. Tomizuka K. Science. 2005; 309: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). hRspo1 was also found to be effective in preventing intestinal mucositis caused by cancer chemotherapy in a mouse model (31Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T. Tang T. Binnerts M. Liu Y. Boyle B. Park E. Emtage P. Funk W.D. Tomizuka K. Science. 2005; 309: 1256-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This property of hRspo1 strongly correlates with its ability to induce β-catenin accumulation and activation of lymphoid enhancer factor/TCF target genes. Despite the biological and potential therapeutic significance, the mechanism by which the R-spondin family of proteins activates β-catenin signaling is not fully understood. It has been proposed that the Frizzled-LRP5/6 complex may not act as R-spondin receptors, because of an apparent lack of detectable R-spondin2-Frizzled or R-spondin2-LRP5/6 interaction (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 31Kim K.A. Kakitani M. Zhao J. Oshima T.

However, a recent study showed that R-spondin3 can be co-immunoprecipitated with the extracellular domain of either Frizzled8 or LRP6 (32Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In an effort to search for receptor(s) involved in R-spondin signaling, we found that LRP6, but not Frizzled, is a high affinity receptor for hRspo1 (Kd = 1.2 nm). In both mammalian cells and Xenopus embryo injection, LRP6 strongly synergizes with hRspo1 to stimulate β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, hRspo1 induces LRP6 phosphorylation, which is a key event involved in the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293T cells and MEF cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at standard conditions. L cells and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. For transient transfection, the TOPFLASH reporter and pRL-TK constructs were used. Cells were cultured in 24-well plates, and transfection was performed using Lipofectamine-2000 according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. Dual luciferase assays were carried out 48 h after transfection according to manufacturer's instruction (Promega). To knock down GSK3α, GSK3β-/-; GSK3αflox/flox MEF cells were infected with lentivirus expressing Cre recombinase in the presence of 10 μg/ml Polybrene for 3 days. Cells were then treated with Wnt3a CM and/or hRspo1 for 2 h. Cell lysates were collected for Western blotting.

Coding regions of the first plus the second propellers (ECD12) or the third plus the fourth propellers (ECD34) of the LRP6 extracellular domain were amplified by PCR and cloned upstream in-frame of the human IgG Fc fragment in pCDNA3.1. These plasmids express fusion proteins as ECD12-IgG or ECD34-IgG. To make the HA-tagged Frizzled, two tandem repeats of HA were inserted after the Frizzled5 signal peptide in the pCS2+ vector. Coding regions of other Frizzled without the signal peptide were amplified by PCR and cloned into downstream of the HA tag using XhoI and XbaI sites (HA-Frizzled1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -8, and -10), XhoI and NheI sites (HA-Frizzled6), or XhoI site and SalI sites (HA-Frizzled7). Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—β-Catenin stabilization assay was performed as described previously (18Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the following antibodies were used: anti-c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin (Sigma), anti-β-catenin (BD Biosciences), anti-phospho-LRP6 (Cell Signaling), anti-GSK3 (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-Dishevelled 3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, conditioned medium (CM) from HEK293T cells transfected with hRspo1-MycHis was mixed with conditioned medium from cells transfected with IgG, LRP6N-IgG, ECD12-IgG, or ECD34-IgG and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The mixture was then incubated with protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and washed with buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20 with protease inhibitors). Protein was eluted using 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by a 4-12% gradient gel (Invitrogen). Western blotting was performed using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-human IgG (Calbiochem) or anti-c-Myc. Conditioned Medium and hRspo1 Protein Purification—Wnt3a CM was obtained by culturing Wnt3a-L cells as suggested (ATCC). CM containing human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP), hRspo1-AP, DKK1, IgG, mFz8CRD-IgG, or LRP6N-IgG was generated by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. To purify hRspo1 protein, stably transfected HEK293T cells were cultured in a suspension culture apparatus. Proteins in the culture medium were then precipitated with ammonium sulfate and resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 8.0. After dialyzing in the same buffer, hRspo1 protein was purified sequentially through a Q-Sepharose HP column and heparin affinity column. Fractions containing hRspo1 were combined and further purified by nickel-Sepharose columns. The final fractions of hRspo1 were combined and dialyzed twice to remove any contamination of nickel and imidazole. The purity of the final hRspo1 protein was at least 99% as evaluated by Coomassie gel staining. Purified protein was sterilized through a 0.22-μm filter and stored at -80 °C. Alkaline Phosphatase Staining and Binding Affinity Assay—Cell surface binding under native conditions was performed as reported (34Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS7 cells were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with AP conditioned medium or with hRspo1-AP conditioned medium. After incubation, cells were washed six times with washing buffer (0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% sodium azide, pH 7.0), and then fixed for 15 s in 60% acetone, 3% formaldehyde in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0. After washing twice with Hanks' balanced salt solution, the fixed cells were heat-inactivated at 65 °C overnight. Cells were stained at room temperature with bromochloroindolyl phosphate (0.17 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.33 mg/ml) until color developed. Staining and fluorescence images were taken using an anatomic microscope (Leica). Solid phase binding affinity measurement was performed as described (24Semenov M.V. Tamai K. Brott B.K. Kuhl M.

Xenopus laevis Embryo Manipulations and RT-PCR—Procedures for embryo staging, injection, and animal cap assays were done as described (35Kato Y. Shi Y. He X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9364-9373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR were performed as described (35Kato Y. Shi Y. He X. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9364-9373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EF1α was used as positive control. Reverse transcriptase negative (RT-) reactions showed no evidence of genomic DNA contamination. The primers used were as described previously (36Darras S. Marikawa Y. Elinson R.P. Lemaire P. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 4275-4286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway by Purified Recombinant hRspo1—We generated expression vectors for various versions of tagged hRspo1 or truncated hRspo1 (Fig. 1A). These plasmids were transiently transfected into HEK293T cells, and CM were collected 2 days after transfection. Unlike Xenopus Rspo2 (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) or mouse Rspo1 (29Kamata T. Katsube K. Michikawa M. Yamada M. Takada S. Mizusawa H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), all versions of hRspo1 proteins were readily detected in CM, and deletion of the carboxyl terminus had no significant effect on hRspo1 secretion (data not shown). We first examined the ability of untagged hRspo1 and epitope-tagged wild type or mutant hRspo1 to activate β-catenin signaling in mouse L cells. hRspo1 alone was not capable of stabilizing cytosolic β-catenin in L cells (Fig. 1B) as reported (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, hRspo1 and Wnt3a synergized to stabilize β-catenin (Fig. 1B). Thus although either low amounts of hRspo1 CM or Wnt3a CM were not able to stabilize β-catenin, hRspo1 and Wnt3a CM together strongly stabilized β-catenin. Consistent with studies on Xenopus Rspo2 and mouse Rspo3 (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), the activity of hRspo1 was not compromised by deletion of the thrombospondin domain and/or the carboxyl terminus, indicating that the furin repeats harbor the full functional capability of hRspo1 to activate β-catenin signaling. We found that hRspo1 proteins with different tags, such as Myc/His, FLAG, or human fetal AP, are functionally active as indicated by the induction of β-catenin accumulation. Because Myc/His-tagged hRspo1 was functional, we developed a tandem affinity protocol to purify recombinant hRspo1 protein using CM from HEK293T cells stably transfected with hRspo1. As mouse Rspo3 was reported to bind to heparin (32Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), we fractionated hRspo1 CM sequentially through heparin affinity and nickel affinity columns, which resulted in highly purified hRspo1 with 95% recovery from the CM and more than 1000-fold enrichment (Fig. 1C and data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1D, purified hRspo1 alone was sufficient to stabilize cytosolic β-catenin, and it also strongly synergized with Wnt3a CM to induce accumulation of β-catenin in HEK293T cells. hRspo1 Synergizes with LRP6 to Stimulate Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Mammalian Cells—Previous studies suggested that Xenopus Rspo2 and mouse Rspo3 have the ability to activate TCF/β-catenin-dependent transcription (30Kazanskaya O. Glinka A. del Barco Barrantes I. Stannek P. Niehrs C. Wu W. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 525-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Nam J.S. Turcotte T.J. Smith P.F. Choi S. Yoon J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13247-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To further characterize hRspo1-induced signaling, transient transfection experiments were performed in HEK293T cells using a TCF/β-catenin reporter (TOPFLASH). hRspo1 alone induced TOPFLASH luciferase activity, likely via using the endogenous receptor(s); hRspo1 and LRP6 synergized strongly when co-transfected (Fig. 2A). When hRspo1 was co-transfected with different HA-Frizzled cDNAs, it synergized with Frizzled5 and -8 and, to a lesser extent, with Frizzled1 and -4 to stimulate TOPFLASH reporter activity (Fig. 2B). Expression of hRspo1 with Frizzled2, -3, -6, -7, or -0 did not further stimulate TOPFLASH luciferase reporter activity (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The expression level of different HA-Frizzled proteins was comparable as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that LRP6 and a few selected Frizzled proteins participate in hRspo1 signaling. Cell Surface Binding of hRspo1-AP to LRP6—As shown in Fig. 1B, hRspo1-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein (hRspo1-AP) was efficiently secreted and was capable of stimulating β-catenin signaling the same extent as the wild type hRspo1. When hRspo1-AP CM was incubated at room temperature with HEK293T cells for 2 h and visualized subsequently with bromochloroindolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium histochemical reaction, strong cell-associated AP activity was observed (data not shown). This was also true for other cell types tested, including L cells, MEFs, and COS7 cells (Fig. 3A). As a control, the secreted AP protein did not stain any of these cells under the same conditions (Fig. 3A and data not shown). The hRspo1-AP staining could be due to binding of hRspo1-AP to the extracellular matrix, similar to that of Wingless, which adheres to the extracellular matrix of a variety of cultured cells (37Bhanot P. Brink M. Samos C.H. Hsieh J.C. Wang Y. Macke J.P. Andrew D. Nathans J. Nusse R. Nature. 1996; 382: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), or it could be due to the binding of hRspo1-AP to endogenously expressed receptor(s) in these cells. We used COS7 cells to test hRspo1-AP binding to candidate receptors because these cells have been successfully used for ligand-receptor binding studies (34Flanagan J.G. Cheng H.J. Feldheim D.A. Hattori M. Lu Q. Vanderhaeghen P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 327: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We performed the binding assay at 4 °C to reduce the possible internalization and degradation of ligand-receptor complexes. As shown in Fig. 3A, hRspo1-AP showed significantly stronger binding to cells transfected with LRP6 than to the untransfected cells, and this binding correlated with the expression of green fluorescence protein which marked the transfected cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, cells expressing Frizzled1, -2, -5, and -8 did not show significant binding above the control level (Fig. 3A and data not shown). This was surprising given that Frizzled1, -5, or -8 can synergize with hRspo1 in signaling (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that LRP6 is a specific binding receptor for hRspo1. To determine the binding affinity of hRspo1 to LRP6, we performed a solid phase enzyme-linked binding assay in which increasing amounts of hRspo1-AP were incubated with immobilized IgG, mFz8CRD-IgG (mouse Frizzled8 cysteine-rich domain fused with IgG) (33Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), or LRP6N-IgG (LRP6 extracellular domain fused with IgG) (15Tamai K. Semenov M. Kato Y. Spokony R. Liu C. Katsuyama Y. Hess F. Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Nature. 2000; 407: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, hRspo1-AP bound to LRP6N-IgG, and the binding was saturable. In contrast, hRspo1-AP did not bind to IgG alone. hRspo1-AP did not bind to mFz8CRD-IgG, or bound with very low affinity, consistent with the lacking of detectable hRspo1-AP-binding to Frizzled transfected cells (Fig. 3A). A Scatchard plot derived from the hRspo1-AP/LRP6N-IgG binding data suggested a binding affinity (Kd) at 1.2 nm (Fig. 3D). Therefore, LRP6 is a high affinity receptor for hRspo1. To further map the interaction between hRspo1 and LRP6, we made constructs expressing secreted forms of the extracellular propeller domains of LRP6, propellers 1 plus 2 (ECD12-IgG), and propellers 3 plus 4 (ECD34-IgG), which are fused with the human IgG Fc fragment. After transfection into HEK293T cells, these fusion proteins, similar to LRP6N-IgG, were secreted into CM as indicated by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using hRspo1-MycHis CM and CM containing IgG, LRP6N-IgG, ECD12-IgG, or ECD34-IgG. As shown in Fig. 4B, hRspo1 was co-immunoprecipitated with LRP6N-IgG, ECD12-IgG, or ECD34-IgG but not with IgG alone. hRspo1 binding to LRP6N-IgG appeared to be stronger than to either ECD12-IgG or ECD34-IgG alone, as significantly more abundant ECD12-IgG or ECD34-IgG in CM co-precipitated comparable amounts of hRspo1 as LRP6N-IgG did (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that hRspo1 may interact with multiple propeller repeat domains. hRspo1 Induces LRP6 Phosphorylation—Our previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of LRP6 is critical for signaling induced by the Wnt family of proteins. A PPPSPXS motif, which is reiterated five times in the LRP6 intracellular domain, is sequentially phosphorylated by GSK3 and casein kinase 1 upon Wnt induction (18Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R. Okamura H. Woodgett J. He X. Nature. 2005; 438: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this motif promotes the engagement of LRP6 with the scaffolding protein Axin, thereby transducing the extracellular Wnt signal into intracellular compartments (18Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 19Zeng X. Tamai K. Doble B. Li S. Huang H. Habas R.

Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this mechanism is also involved in R-spondin-mediated signaling, we treated MEFs with purified hRspo1. As shown in Fig. 5A, phosphorylation of the endogenous LRP6 was induced within 15 min of exposure to 400 ng/ml hRspo1, as detected by a phosphorylated PPPSP motif-specific antibody (18Tamai K. Zeng X. Liu C. Zhang X. Harada Y. Chang Z. He X. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 149-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The peak level of phosphorylation appeared to be between 2 and 8 h after hRspo1 stimulation, a temporal pattern that was similar to Wnt3a-induced LRP6 phosphorylation in these cells (data not shown). hRspo1 induced LRP6 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner to about 800 ng/ml; higher"
https://openalex.org/W2113890085,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a dominant polyglutamine expansion within the N-terminus of huntingtin protein and results in oxidative stress, energetic insufficiency and striatal degeneration. Copper and iron are increased in the striata of HD patients, but the role of these metals in HD pathogenesis is unknown. We found, using inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectroscopy, that elevations of copper and iron found in human HD brain are reiterated in the brains of affected HD transgenic mice. Increased brain copper correlated with decreased levels of the copper export protein, amyloid precursor protein. We hypothesized that increased amounts of copper bound to low affinity sites could contribute to pro-oxidant activities and neurodegeneration. We focused on two proteins: huntingtin, because of its centrality to HD, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), because of its documented sensitivity to copper, necessity for normoxic brain energy metabolism and evidence for altered lactate metabolism in HD brain. The first 171 amino acids of wild-type huntingtin, and its glutamine expanded mutant form, interacted with copper, but not iron. N171 reduced Cu2+ in vitro in a 1∶1 copper∶protein stoichiometry indicating that this fragment is very redox active. Further, copper promoted and metal chelation inhibited aggregation of cell-free huntingtin. We found decreased LDH activity, but not protein, and increased lactate levels in HD transgenic mouse brain. The LDH inhibitor oxamate resulted in neurodegeneration when delivered intra-striatially to healthy mice, indicating that LDH inhibition is relevant to neurodegeneration in HD. Our findings support a role of pro-oxidant copper-protein interactions in HD progression and offer a novel target for pharmacotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2030552305,"In nanocrystalline metals, lack of intragranular dislocation sources leads to plastic deformation mechanisms that substantially differ from those in coarse-grained metals. However, irrespective of grain size, plastic deformation is considered irrecoverable. We show experimentally that plastically deformed nanocrystalline aluminum and gold films with grain sizes of 65 nanometers and 50 nanometers, respectively, recovered a substantial fraction (50 to 100%) of plastic strain after unloading. This recovery was time dependent and was expedited at higher temperatures. Furthermore, the stress-strain characteristics during the next loading remained almost unchanged when strain recovery was complete. These observations in two dissimilar face-centered cubic metals suggest that strain recovery might be characteristic of other metals with similar grain sizes and crystalline packing."
https://openalex.org/W2027954852,"Differentiation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) to extracellular matrix– and growth factor–producing cells supports liver regeneration through promotion of hepatocyte proliferation. We show that the neurotrophin receptor p75 NTR , a tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member expressed in HSCs after fibrotic and cirrhotic liver injury in humans, is a regulator of liver repair. In mice, depletion of p75 NTR exacerbated liver pathology and inhibited hepatocyte proliferation in vivo. p75 NTR –/– HSCs failed to differentiate to myofibroblasts and did not support hepatocyte proliferation. Moreover, inhibition of p75 NTR signaling to the small guanosine triphosphatase Rho resulted in impaired HSC differentiation. Our results identify signaling from p75 NTR to Rho as a mechanism for the regulation of HSC differentiation to regeneration-promoting cells that support hepatocyte proliferation in the diseased liver."

https://openalex.org/W1975995116,"Background A promising clinical application for stem and progenitor cell transplantation is in rescue therapy for degenerative diseases. This strategy seeks to preserve rather than restore host tissue function by taking advantage of unique properties often displayed by these versatile cells. In studies using different neurodegenerative disease models, transplanted human neural progenitor cells (hNPC) protected dying host neurons within both the brain and spinal cord. Based on these reports, we explored the potential of hNPC transplantation to rescue visual function in an animal model of retinal degeneration, the Royal College of Surgeons rat. Methodology/Principal Findings Animals received unilateral subretinal injections of hNPC or medium alone at an age preceding major photoreceptor loss. Principal outcomes were quantified using electroretinography, visual acuity measurements and luminance threshold recordings from the superior colliculus. At 90–100 days postnatal, a time point when untreated rats exhibit little or no retinal or visual function, hNPC-treated eyes retained substantial retinal electrical activity and visual field with near-normal visual acuity. Functional efficacy was further enhanced when hNPC were genetically engineered to secrete glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. Histological examination at 150 days postnatal showed hNPC had formed a nearly continuous pigmented layer between the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium, as well as distributed within the inner retina. A concomitant preservation of host cone photoreceptors was also observed. Conclusions/Significance Wild type and genetically modified human neural progenitor cells survive for prolonged periods, migrate extensively, secrete growth factors and rescue visual functions following subretinal transplantation in the Royal College of Surgeons rat. These results underscore the potential therapeutic utility of hNPC in the treatment of retinal degenerative diseases and suggest potential mechanisms underlying their effect in vivo."

The present study examined the role of the EP4 receptor in regulating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tubulogenesis. Primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were isolated from EP4flox/flox mice and were rendered null for the EP4 receptor with adenoCre virus. Whereas treatment with PGE2 or the EP4 selective agonists PGE1-OH and ONO-AE1–329 induced migration, tubulogenesis, ERK activation and cAMP production in control adenovirus-transduced endothelial EP4flox/flox cells, no effects were seen in adenoCre-transduced EP4flox/flox cells. The EP4 agonist-induced endothelial cell migration was inhibited by ERK, but not PKA inhibitors, defining a functional link between PGE2-induced endothelial cell migration and EP4-mediated ERK signaling. Finally, PGE2, as well as PGE1-OH and ONO-AE1–329, also promoted angiogenesis in an in vivo sponge assay providing evidence that the EP4 receptor mediates de novo vascularization in vivo.

Angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing vessels, is a multistep event that requires endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Angiogenesis is controlled by diverse factors, including cytokines, growth factors, as well as cyclooxygenase-2-derived eicosanoids (1Gately S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Gately S. Li W.W. Semin. Oncol. 2004; 31: 2-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pro-angiogenic effects of cyclooxygenase-2 are mediated primarily by three products of arachidonic acid metabolism: thromboxane A2, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), 2The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; EP, E-prostanoid receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: PG, prostaglandin; EP, E-prostanoid receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; FCS, fetal calf serum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. and prostaglandin I2. These pro-angiogenic eicosanoids directly stimulate the synthesis of angiogenic factors, promote vascular sprouting, migration, tube formation, as well as enhance endothelial cell survival (1Gately S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Gately S. Li W.W. Semin. Oncol. 2004; 31: 2-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 exerts its cellular effects by binding to four distinct E-prostanoid receptors (EP1–4) that belong to the family of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled rhodopsin-type receptors (3Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Even though there is similar signaling mechanisms among these receptors, it is clear that each receptor has different and often opposing biological effects (4Regan J.W. Life Sci. 2003; 74: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For example, although the EP2 and EP4 receptors are both Gs coupled receptors and up-regulate intracellular cAMP levels, they mediate differential phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding proteins (5Fujino H. Salvi S. Regan J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition, following activation, these two receptors exert different downstream effects on important intracellular mediators, including the PI3K and ERK pathways (6Fujino H. Xu W. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12151-12156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Pozzi A. Yan X. Macias-Perez I. Wei S. Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Morrow J.D. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29797-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, the EP3 receptor usually counteracts EP2- and EP4-mediated up-regulation of cAMP by preferentially coupling to Gi proteins (3Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Some information regarding the role of PGE2 in angiogenesis has been obtained using cancer models in mice where the receptors have been deleted by homologous recombination. In this context, mice lacking the EP2 receptor produce significantly fewer and less vascularized tumors than wild type mice in a two-stage skin carcinogenesis protocol (8Sung Y.M. He G. Fischer S.M. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9304-9311Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and the EP2 receptor was demonstrated to directly contribute to endothelial cell migration and survival (9Kamiyama M. Pozzi A. Yang L. Debusk L.M. Breyer R.M. Lin P.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, EP3-null mice exhibit decreased tumor growth and tumor-associated angiogenesis compared with wild type mice following injection of sarcoma or lung carcinoma cells (10Amano H. Hayashi I. Endo H. Kitasato H. Yamashina S. Maruyama T. Kobayashi M. Satoh K. Narita M. Sugimoto Y. Murata T. Yoshimura H. Narumiya S. Majima M. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In contrast, the EP1 receptor does not appear to play a role in tumor-associated angiogenesis (11Axelsson H. Lonnroth C. Wang W. Svanberg E. Lundholm K. Angiogenesis. 2005; 8: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and, with the exception of one in vivo study (12Kuwano T. Nakao S. Yamamoto H. Tsuneyoshi M. Yamamoto T. Kuwano M. Ono M. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 300-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), there is scant information on the direct role of EP4 receptor in angiogenesis and endothelial cell function. To characterize the contribution of the EP4 receptor in endothelial cell biology, we have undertaken studies utilizing primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells isolated from EP4flox/flox mice (13Schneider A. Guan Y. Zhang Y. Magnuson M.A. Pettepher C. Loftin C.D. Langenbach R. Breyer R.M. Breyer M.D. Genesis. 2004; 40: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which were rendered null for the EP4 receptor by in vitro treatment with adenoCre virus. The present study provides evidence that 1) primary endothelial cells express the EP4 receptor; 2) this receptor directly controls endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis but not proliferation in vitro; 3) activation of ERK is necessary to promote the EP4-mediated endothelial cell migration; and 4) activation of the EP4 receptor by selective agonists promotes angiogenesis in vivo. Thus, the EP4 receptor not only plays a direct role in endothelial cell functions in vitro, but it also mediates angiogenesis in vivo. Generation of EP4-null Endothelial Cells—Primary murine endothelial cells were isolated from EP4flox/flox mice (13Schneider A. Guan Y. Zhang Y. Magnuson M.A. Pettepher C. Loftin C.D. Langenbach R. Breyer R.M. Breyer M.D. Genesis. 2004; 40: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lung vasculature was perfused with PBS, 2.5 mm EDTA followed by 0.25% trypsin, 2.5 mm EDTA via the right ventricle. Lungs were removed and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The visceral pleura was subsequently trimmed and the perfusion was repeated. Primary endothelial cells were recovered and grown on tissue culture plastic in EGM-2-MV containing 5% FCS (Clonetics). Cells at passages 2–4 were used for experiments. For the generation of EP4-null endothelial cells, EP4flox/flox cells were seeded in 6-well plates (105 cells/well) and incubated with 0.5 ml serum-free medium containing 1 × 1012 multiplicity of infection AdenoCre (AdCre) or β-galactosidase (β-AdGal) adenovirus. After 8 h, 1.5 ml of complete medium was added to the wells. After 3 days the cells were transduced again with AdCre or β-AdGal adenovirus as indicated above with a total of three independent treatments. This procedure led to a ∼80–90% reduction of EP4 mRNA and protein expression in AdCre-treated cells (see Fig. 2 for details). RT- and Real-time RT-PCR—RNA was isolated from EP4flox/flox endothelial cells transduced with β-AdGal or AdCre as indicated above using TRIzol reagents. RNA samples were reverse-transcribed using a SuperScript II™ kit and oligo(dT) (12–18 bp) and 100 ng of first strand cDNA was used for real-time PCR. EP4 and 18 S primers as well as fluorescent probes were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA; 18 S catalogue number 4319413E and EP4 catalogue number Mm00436053_m1). The EP4 and 18S probes were labeled at the 5′-end with the reporter fluorophores FAM and VIC respectively and at the 3′-end with a non-fluorescent quencher. Quantitative PCR was performed in a real-time format on the 7700 ABI Prism Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). The cycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s (denaturation step) and 58 °C for 60 s (annealing and extention). Data were analyzed using the comparative Ct method, as described in Applied Biosystems User Bulletin and detailed by Livak and Schmittgen (15Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (116613) Google Scholar). Data were analyzed with Student's t test, and a level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. For the RT-PCR assay, 100 ng of total RNA and utilized to amplify EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, and β-actin fragments using Supermix PCR kit (Invitrogen). PCR conditions are as follows: 94 °C 30 min (1 cycle); 94 °C 30 min, 58 °C 40 min, 72 °C 40 min (35 cycles); 72 °C, 7 min, 4 °C. The primers used were as previously described (7Pozzi A. Yan X. Macias-Perez I. Wei S. Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Morrow J.D. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29797-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar): EP1, CACCCAGGCTCCCCAATACATCTG (sense) and GGAGGGTGGCTGTGGCTGAAG (antisense); EP2, CCGGGGTTCTGGGGAATC (sense) and GTGCATGCGAATGAGGTTGAG (antisense); EP3, CGCCGTCTCGGCAGTC (sense) and TGTGTCGTCTTGCCCCCG (antisense); EP4, TCTCTGGTGGTGCTCATCTG (sense) and CTGCTGATCTCCTTTAACTCCC (antisense); β-actin, TCCTGTGGCATCCACGAAACT (sense) and GAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT (antisense). Proliferation Assay—EP4flox/flox endothelial cells, transduced with β-AdGal or AdCre as described above, were plated in complete medium onto 96-well plates (104 cells/well). After 12 h the cells were incubated with serum-free medium for further 24 h and subsequently incubated with serum free medium containing [3H]thymidine (10 μCi/ml) with or without 1 μm PGE2, PGE1-OH, Butaprost, 17-phenyl-ω-trinor-PGE2 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), ONO-AE1–329 (from Dr. T. Maruyama, ONO Pharmaceuticals, Osaka, Japan), MB-28767 (Rhone-Poulanc Rorer). Twenty-four hours later, the cells were collected and the amount of incorporated [3H]thymidine analyzed as described previously (14Pozzi A. Moberg P.E. Miles L.A. Wagner S. Soloway P. Gardner H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Four independent experiments with quadruplicate samples were performed. Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed using transwell plates fitted with 8-μm membrane filters (Corning Ware). Lower wells were incubated with matrigel (5 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 12 h and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS to inhibit nonspecific cell migration. Serumfree medium with or without PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, MB-28767, Butaprost, 17-phenyl-ω-trinor-PGE2 (1 or 10 μm each), or 10% FCS was then added to the lower wells, while β-AdGal- or AdCre-treated endothelial cells (5 × 104 cells in 300 μl of serum-free medium) were added to the upper wells. To determine the contribution of ERK, PKA, or PI3K to prostanoid-induced migration, serum-starved endothelial cells (to minimize ERK and Akt activation, as well as cAMP production) were allowed to migrate as indicated above in the presence or absence of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (Sigma, 10 μm), the PKA inhibitor H89 (Calbiochem, 10 μm), or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem, 5 μm). After 6 h at 37°C, cells on the top of the filter were removed by wiping, and the filters were then fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Migrating cells were stained with 1% crystal violet, and five randomly chosen fields from duplicate wells were counted at 400× magnification. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate. Matrigel-based Capillary Formation Assay—Capillary-like formation was analyzed as described (16Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated with 50 μl of Matrigel and incubated 30 min at 37 °C. Serum-starved β-AdGal- or AdCre-treated endothelial cells (1 × 104) were plated on solidified Matrigel in 200 μl of serum-free medium with or without PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, MB-28767, Butaprost (1 or 10 μm each), or 10% FCS. Capillary-like structures were recorded (three images per gel per treatment) hourly for a period of 10 h and representative images taken 6 h after plating are shown. To quantify capillary-like network formation, cellular nodes were defined as junctions linking at least three cells, and they were counted from digital images. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate with a total of 18 images analyzed per treatment. Measurement of cAMP—EP4flox/flox endothelial cells untreated or transduced with AdCre were plated in complete medium onto 96-well plates (5 × 103 cells/well) for 24 h after which the cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (250 μm). After 12 h the cells were incubated in PBS containing 250 μm isobutylmethylxanthine with or without PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, MB-28767, Butaprost (1 μm each), or forskolin (10 μm, positive control). After 30 min the intracellular levels of cAMP were determined via commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assays (Discoverx) and expressed in nmol/liter. Three independent experiments were performed in triplicate. Untreated EP4flox/flox cells were used for the experiment instead of β-AdGal-transduced EP4flox/flox cells as this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit is based on a β-galactosidase-dependent assay. Western Blot Analysis—To determine the expression of EP4 protein, membrane fractions were isolated from β-AdGal- and AdCre-treated endothelial cells as follows. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and passaged through a 21-gauge needle. The cell lysates were subsequently layered on a 60% sucrose cushion and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The enriched membrane fraction at the top of the sucrose cushion was collected and passed through a 26-gauge needle. Equal amount of membranes were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels, 50 μg membrane/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-human EP4 (C-terminal amino acids 459–488, Cayman) able to cross-react with mouse EP4 (17Yang L. Huang Y. Porta R. Yanagisawa K. Gonzalez A. Segi E. Johnson D.H. Narumiya S. Carbone D.P. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 9665-9672Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and anti-N-cadherin antibody (1:1,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to verify the purity and equal loading of the subcellular fractionation products. To evaluate the effects of prostanoids on ERK, p38, and Akt phosphorylation semiconfluent β-AdGal- and AdCre-treated endothelial cells were serumstarved for 24 h and then treated with the PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, MB-28767, Butaprost (1 μm or 10 μm each), or 10% FCS for 0 and 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 rpm. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% gels; 30 μg of total protein/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. Membranes were incubated with a rabbit anti-phospho-ERK, anti-phospho-p38, or anti-phospho-Akt antibody (all from Cell Signaling Technology) followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Pierce). Total ERK, p38, and Akt content were verified by stripping the membranes in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, containing 2% SDS and 0.4% β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 55°C and re-probing with a rabbit anti-Akt antibody (Cell Signaling Technology). In Vivo Angiogenesis—The subcutaneous sponge model was used to determine the effects of prostanoids on in vivo angiogenesis (16Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Sterile polyvinyl acetal CF-50 round sponges (8 × 3 mm, a gift from Dr. J. M. Davidson, Vanderbilt University) were implanted under the dorsal skin of C57 Black6 female mice (6 weeks of age, 20 g of body weight, n = 4/treatment). The sponges were then injected every second day for 14 days with 50 μl of either vehicle (corn oil) or PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, MB-28767, Butaprost, or 17-phenyl-ω-trinor-PGE2 (10 μm). Ten minutes before sacrifice, mice were injected intravenously with 50 μl of rhodamine-dextran (Mr 65, 2% in PBS, Sigma) to label blood vessels (16Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and the sponges were subsequently collected and analyzed under an epifluorescence microscope. Rhodamine-dextran-positive structures were imaged, the color images converted to black and white pictures using Photoshop (Adobe) and processed as described (16Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Vascularity within sponges was expressed as a percentage of area occupied by rhodamine-dextran-positive structures per microscopic field. Three images/sponge with a total of 12 images per treatment were used for analysis. Statistical Analysis—The Student's t test was used for comparisons between two groups, and analysis of variance using Sigma-Stat software was used for statistical differences between multiple groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The EP4 Receptor Is Pro-angiogenic in Vivo—To test the contribution of the EP receptors to in vivo angiogenesis, we utilized a subcutaneous sponge model (16Pozzi A. Macias-Perez I. Abair T. Wei S. Su Y. Zent R. Falck J.R. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27138-27146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Inert sponges, implanted subcutaneously in the back of adult mice, were injected every other day with either vehicle (oil), PGE2, the selective EP4 agonists PGE1-OH and ONO-AE1–329; the EP3-selective agonist MB-28767; the EP2 agonist Butaprost; or the EP1 agonist 17-phenyl-ω-trinor-PGE2 (10 μm each). After 14 days, the sponges were isolated and vascular density determined by direct observation and analysis of vessel-associated rhodaminedextran fluorescence. With the exception of MB-28767 and 17-phenyl-ω-trinor-PGE2, all the prostanoids tested were able to induce in vivo angiogenesis (Fig. 1, A–C). Significantly greater vascularization was observed in sponges injected with either PGE2 or the EP4 active agonists PGE1-OH or ONO-AE1–329 compared with sponges injected with the EP2 agonist Butaprost (Fig. 1, A–C). These results indicate that although both EP2 and EP4 receptors are able to promote de novo blood vessel formation, EP4 is the most potent pro-angiogenic receptor (Fig. 1, A–C). Primary Murine Endothelial Cells Express the EP4 Receptor, Which Promotes Cell Migration but Not Proliferation—To determine whether the in vivo EP4 agonist-induced angiogenesis was due to a direct effect of these ligands on endothelial cell function, we analyzed which EP receptors are expressed in cultured endothelial cells by performing RT-PCR analysis on primary EP4flox/flox endothelial cells transduced with control β-AdGal. As shown in Fig. 2A, β-AdGal-transduced endothelial cells expressed mRNA for EP1, EP2 and EP4 subtypes, while EP3 mRNA was not detected. As the pro-angiogenic receptor EP4 is expressed on endothelial cells, we determined its role in mediating endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tubulogenesis by comparing endothelial cells derived from EP4flox/flox mice transduced with either β-AdGal or AdCre virus. As shown in Fig. 2A, we first demonstrated that the levels of EP4 mRNA, but not EP1 or EP2 were significantly decreased in AdCre-transduced endothelial cells. Real-time PCR confirmed that the levels of EP4 mRNA in β-AdGal-treated endothelial cells were ∼10-fold higher than those detected in AdCre-treated cells (Fig. 2B). Decreased expression of the EP4 receptor in AdCre-treated endothelial cells was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of membrane enriched fractions (Fig. 2C). Thus, endothelial cells express the EP4 receptor and treatment of EP4flox/flox endothelial cells with AdCre selectively down-regulates the expression of this receptor without affecting the levels of the other PGE2 binding receptors. As activation of the EP4 receptor promotes angiogenesis in vivo (Fig. 1) and this receptor controls cell growth and survival in different cell types (7Pozzi A. Yan X. Macias-Perez I. Wei S. Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Morrow J.D. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29797-29804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Aoudjit L. Potapov A. Takano T. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F1534-F1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we examined whether the EP4 receptor contributes to PGE2-mediated endothelial cell proliferation. For this reason, endothelial cells were treated with PGE2, PGE1-OH, ONO-AE1–329, Butaprost, MB-28767, or 17 phenyl-ω-trinor PGE2 (1 μm each). Unlike serum-treatment, none of the specific agonists induced cell proliferation in either β-AdGal- or AdCre-transduced endothelial cells (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that PGE2-induced activation of the EP receptors is not sufficient to promote endothelial cell proliferation. In contrast, PGE2, PGE1-OH and ONO-AE1–329 used at 1 μm significantly stimulated migration of β-AdGal-, but not AdCre-transduced endothelial cells, suggesting that low doses of PGE2 promotes endothelial cell migration via activation of the EP4 receptor (Fig. 3B). The EP3 agonist MB-28767 did not promote endothelial cell migration (Fig. 3B). Moreover, no significant differences in basal or serum-induced cell migration were observed between β-AdGal- and AdCre-treated cells (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, 17-phenyl-ω-trinor PGE2 used at both low (1 μm) and high (10 μm) doses did not promote endothelial cell migration (Fig. 3B), suggesting that, although endothelial cells express EP1 mRNA (Fig. 2A), this receptor does not play a direct role in endothelial cell migration. Finally, activation of the EP2 receptor with high (10 μm) but not low (1 μm) doses of Butaprost promoted migration of either β-AdGal- or AdCre-treated endothelial cells (Fig. 3B), confirming the data that high doses of EP2 ligands are able to promote endothelial cell migration (9Kamiyama M. Pozzi A. Yang L. Debusk L.M. Breyer R.M. Lin P.C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7019-7028Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We were unable to determine whether high doses of PGE2 (i.e. 10 μm) could lead to migration in both β-AdGal- and AdCre-treated cells, as this dose was cytotoxic for endothelial cells of both genotypes. The EP4 Receptor Promotes Capillary-like Structure Formation—The role of EP4 receptor activation in the formation of capillary-like structures was assessed by plating endothelial cells on solidified Matrigel in the absence of serum. Within 6 h, β-AdGal-treated cells formed capillary-like structures more efficiently than AdCre-treated cells at base line, suggesting that the EP4 receptor plays a role in endothelial branching (Fig. 4, A and B). PGE2, PGE1-OH, and ONO-AE1–329 (1 μm each) significantly increased the formation of capillary-like structures only in β-AdGal-transduced cells (Fig. 4, A and B), thus confirming that at low doses PGE2 seems to support tubulogenesis primarily via activation of the EP4 receptor. In contrast, no significant changes were observed with MB-28767 (used as negative control). Finally, whereas Butaprost at 1 μm failed to stimulate endothelial cell tubulogenesis, at 10 μm it stimulated capillary-like structure formation in both EP4 expressing and EP4 non-expressing endothelial cells (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that although both EP2 and EP4 receptors can mediate capillary-like structure formation, engagement of EP2 receptor requires high doses of ligand. Activation of the EP4 Receptor Leads to Increased Intracellular cAMP Levels and ERK Activation—Activation of either EP2 and EP4 receptors, which are both expressed in primary endothelial cells (Fig. 2A), stimulates the production of intracellular cAMP in a cell specific manner (3Breyer R.M. Bagdassarian C.K. Myers S.A. Breyer M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 661-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Moreover, PGE2 promotes angiogenesis by increasing levels of cAMP in human endothelial cells (19Namkoong S. Lee S.J. Kim C.K. Kim Y.M. Chung H.T. Lee H. Han J.A. Ha K.S. Kwon Y.G. Kim Y.M. Exp. Mol. Med. 2005; 37: 588-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although the receptor that mediates these effects is unknown. For these reasons, we analyzed whether the EP2 and EP4 receptors can stimulate intracellular cAMP levels in microvascular endothelial cells and which of these two receptors exerts this function. As shown in Fig. 5A, treatment with PGE2 and the EP2 agonist Butaprost (both at 1 μm) increased intracellular levels of cAMP in both Ep4flox/flox and AdCre-transduced Ep4flox/flox endothelial cells. In contrast, treatment with the EP3 agonist MB-28767 (negative control) failed to stimulate cAMP production in either cell type. Conversely, treatment with the EP4 agonists PGE1-OH or ONO-AE1–329 stimulated cAMP production only in EP4flox/flox endothelial cells. Thus, this finding suggests that activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors by low doses of ligands induce cAMP production in endothelial cells. Based on observations that stimulation of the EP4 receptor leads to phosphorylation of ERK and Akt (6Fujino H. Xu W. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12151-12156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 7Pozzi A. Yan X. Macias-Perez I. Wei S. Hata A.N. Breyer R.M. Morrow J.D. Capdevila J.H. J. Biol.

Commun. 2005; 338: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we determined the contribution of the EP4 receptor to the activation of these protein kinases in primary endothelial cells. Incubation of β-AdGal- and AdCre-transduced EP4flox/flox cells with PGE2, PGE1-OH, or ONO-AE1–329 (1 μm each) resulted in a marked increase in ERK phosphorylation, and to a lesser extent Akt and p38 MAPK activation, only in endothelial cells expressing the EP4 receptor (Fig. 5B). In contrast, treatment with 1 μm MB-28767 (negative control) or 1 μm Butaprost did not promote phosphorylation of these three kinases (Fig. 5B) in either β-AdGal- or AdCre-transduced cells. Interestingly, when used at 10 μm Butaprost stimulated ERK activation in both cell types (Fig. 5B), thus paralleling the finding that high doses of EP2 ligand can promote both migration (Fig. 3B) and capillary-like structure formation (Fig. 4). Thus, this data indicates that activation of EP4 receptor by low doses of ligand results in both cAMP production and ERK activation. In contrast, activation of EP2 b"

https://openalex.org/W1995407213,"Dramatic improvements in high throughput sequencing technologies have led to a staggering growth in the number of predicted genes. However, a large fraction of these newly discovered genes do not have a functional assignment. Fortunately, a variety of novel high-throughput genome-wide functional screening technologies provide important clues that shed light on gene function. The integration of heterogeneous data to predict protein function has been shown to improve the accuracy of automated gene annotation systems. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a probabilistic approach for protein function prediction that integrates protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, gene expression data, protein motif information, mutant phenotype data, and protein localization data. First, functional linkage graphs are constructed from PPI data and gene expression data, in which an edge between nodes (proteins) represents evidence for functional similarity. The assumption here is that graph neighbors are more likely to share protein function, compared to proteins that are not neighbors. The functional linkage graph model is then used in concert with protein domain, mutant phenotype and protein localization data to produce a functional prediction. Our method is applied to the functional prediction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes, using Gene Ontology (GO) terms as the basis of our annotation. In a cross validation study we show that the integrated model increases recall by 18%, compared to using PPI data alone at the 50% precision. We also show that the integrated predictor is significantly better than each individual predictor. However, the observed improvement vs. PPI depends on both the new source of data and the functional category to be predicted. Surprisingly, in some contexts integration hurts overall prediction accuracy. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive assignment of putative GO terms to 463 proteins that currently have no assigned function."

To develop a strategy for the prevention and the therapy of skin cancer, relationships between the various cellular signaling pathways that modulate cellular responses to UV irradiation in skin cells require a more in-depth understanding. Within this complex group of UV-induced cellular responses, the role of ROS 3The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; SOD, superoxide dismutase; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PI, propidium iodide; DPI, diphenylene iodonium; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; CM-H2DCF-DA, 6-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. appears central with dual effects (3.Heck D.E.

On one hand, an increase in ROS concentrations following UVB irradiation leads to cytotoxicity through protein, lipid, and DNA oxidation both in vitro and in vivo (4.McArdle F. Rhodes L.E. Parslew R.

Whereas the second peak in ROS concentration has a direct effect on apoptosis, the first peak could mediate signal transduction (10.Rezvani H.R. Mazurier F. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C.

In this study, we addressed the possible role of ROS as second messengers after UVB irradiation and their potential relationship with a stress-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1. This factor, so named for its exquisite sensitivity to oxygen levels in the cell environment, participates in the regulation of numerous genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, apoptosis, migration, and metastasis (15.Bardos J.I.

We decided to look at HIF-1α expression within the context of ROS production in keratinocytes, in response to UVB irradiation, because ROS were already known to influence HIF-1α regulation and hypoxia-induced apoptosis (19.Kietzmann T. Gorlach A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Moreover, involvement of HIF in the modulation of cell responses to growth factors under normoxia in a ROS-dependent manner (19.Kietzmann T. Gorlach A. Semin. Cell Dev.

In normoxia, HIF-1α is rapidly targeted for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after binding to the von Hippel-Lindau protein. The hydroxylation of HIF-1α mediated by prolyl hydroxylases is a prerequisite for the association of HIF-1α with von Hippel-Lindau protein (15.Bardos J.I. Ashcroft M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 107-120PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Bardos J.I. Chau N.M. Ashcroft M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2905-2914Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26.Lee J.W. Bae S.H. Jeong J.W.

Res. 2006; 71: 642-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Reduction in prolyl hydroxylase activity under hypoxic conditions results in the stabilization and the accumulation of HIF-1α. Hypoxia-mediated ROS modulation and post-transcriptional modification (mainly phosphorylation) of HIF-1α has also been shown to be important in its stabilization and/or transcriptional activation process (28.Bell E.L. Emerling B.M. Chandel N.S. Mitochondrion. 2005; 5: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29.Brahimi-Horn C. Mazure N. Pouyssegur J. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When stabilized, HIF-1α can be involved in hypoxia-induced apoptosis via either direct or indirect interaction with p53 or through the induction of pro- or antiapoptotic proteins (30.Greijer A.E. van der Wall E. J. Clin. Pathol. 2004; 57: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). DNA damage and genetic instability under severe hypoxia, resulting in p53 activation, has been shown that has an important role in the modulation of HIF-1α and the activation of the apoptotic pathways (30.Greijer A.E. van der Wall E.

In this paper, we report the implication of UVB-induced ROS as second messengers in apoptosis through the modulation of HIF-1α, suggesting a novel and key role of HIF-1α in the cell response to UVB and a putative involvement in photocarcinogenesis. Source of Keratinocytes and Irradiation Procedure−Keratinocytes were isolated from normal human skin in patients undergoing plastic surgery, grown in MCDB153 medium, and irradiated at a dose of 200 mJ·cm-2 using a Biotronic device (Vilber Lourmat, Marne la Vallée, France), equipped with a dosimeter, in which the UVB lamp emitted a continuous spectrum between 280 and 380 nm (major peak at 312 nm), as already described (9.Rezvani H.R. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. de Verneuil H. Taieb A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2007; 14: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10.Rezvani H.R. Mazurier F. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C.

Lentiviral Vector Constructs and Keratinocyte Transduction−The lentivectors used for transduction (TPCatalaseW, TPCuZnSODW, and TPMnSODW; see supplemental Fig. S2A) have been previously described (9.Rezvani H.R. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. de Verneuil H. Taieb A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2007; 14: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10.Rezvani H.R. Mazurier F. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C.

Briefly, the different lentiviral vectors were constructed by inserting catalase, CuZn-SOD, and Mn-SOD cDNAs into the multiple cloning site of the TPW vector downstream of the human phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. TPW was also used as the backbone for the construction of the THshHIF1W by replacement of human phosphoglycerate kinase by a cassette containing the H1 promoter followed by an shRNA sequence (GATGTTAGCTCCCTATATCCC) targeting the HIF-1α mRNA (see supplemental Fig. S3A). Lentiviral particles were produced by transient transfection of 293T cells using a calcium phosphate transfection technique as previously described (9.Rezvani H.R. Cario-Andre M. Pain C.

Agami (32.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Determination of the titer of each viral supernatant was performed by assessing enhanced green fluorescent protein expression by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of p24. For transduction, keratinocytes (5 × 105 cells/T25 flask) were incubated for 24 h in complete medium. Prior to infection, medium was removed, and cells were incubated with viral supernatants for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 8 μg/ml protamine sulfate. After 5 days, the percentage of enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells was determined by cytofluorimetry (9.Rezvani H.R. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. de Verneuil H. Taieb A.

Determination of Catalase, CuZn-SOD, and Mn-SOD Activities−All of these assays were performed as previously described (9.Rezvani H.R. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. de Verneuil H. Taieb A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2007; 14: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10.Rezvani H.R. Mazurier F. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. Taieb A. de Verneuil H. J. Biol.

Apoptosis Analysis−For apoptosis and necrosis measurements, 20 h after irradiation, keratinocytes were incubated with 5 μmol/liter fluorescein isothiocyanate-VAD-fmk (Promega, Charbonnie`res, France) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark and then with 2.5 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI; Sigma). Cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blotting Procedure−Western blotting was performed as previously described (10.Rezvani H.R. Mazurier F. Cario-Andre M. Pain C. Ged C. Taieb A. de Verneuil H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17999-18007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride membranes. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of the anti-caspase-3, -8, and -9 monoclonal antibodies, anti-human p53 and serine 15-phosphorylated p53, anti-phospho-p44/42 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK, or anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Le Perray en Yvelines, France); anti-CuZn-SOD or anti-Mn-SOD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-catalase (Rockland); or anti-HIF-1α (BD Transduction Laboratories, Le Pont de Claix, France) antibodies. After additional incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of an anti-immunoglobin horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Vector Laboratories, Biovalley S.A, Marne la Vallée, France) for 1 h, blots were developed using the chemiluminescence ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Dephosphorylation Assay−The cells were sonicated in 0.1 m Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) for two 10-s bursts. After a 10-min centrifugation at 12,000 × g, total protein concentration was determined by the BCA kit reagent (Pierce). After incubation of 50 μg of protein of each sample in Tris/MgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C, 15 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Ozyme, Orsay, France) was added. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were resolved in SDS-PAGE and revealed by immunoblot analysis. HIF-1α DNA Binding Activity Analysis−Nuclear proteins were prepared with the TransAM™ nuclear extract kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). HIF-1α activation was determined with the TransAM™ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. In brief, 15 μg of nuclear extract was added to each well of a 96-well plate coated with an immobilized oligonucleotide corresponding to the HRE consensus sequence. One hour later, wells were incubated with HIF-1α antibody for 1 h followed by 1 h of incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody. Thirty minutes after the addition of developing solution, the reaction was stopped by the addition of H2SO4, and the final A450 was read on a microplate reader. Measurement of Intracellular ROS−The intracellular production of ROS was assessed using the CM-H2DCF-DA probe (Molecular Probes) or the MitoSOX™ red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Molecular Probes). Briefly, after the addition of CM-H2DCF-DA (5 μm) or MitoSOX (5 μm), cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark. Whereas CM-H2DCF is oxidized by cytoplasmic ROS to the highly green fluorescent CM-DCF compound, MitoSOX is targeted to the mitochondria and oxidized by superoxide to a red fluorescence component. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Ten thousand individual data points were collected for each sample. To observe ROS production by fluorescence microscopy, keratinocytes grown on glass coverslips in 3.5-cm wells were loaded with CM-H2DCF-DA or MitoSOX as mentioned above. After two washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were observed and photographed under a fluorescence microscope. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR−Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol® (Invitrogen) according to the procedure of the manufacturer. RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on ethidium bromide-stained 1% agarose gels. Total cellular RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed at 42 °C for 60 min in 28 μl containing 0.07 units/μl reverse transcriptase, 7.3 mm dithiothreithol, 0.5 mm each deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs), and 3.6 μm oligo(dT) primer (Invitrogen). Reactions were stopped by heat inactivation for 10 min at 92 °C. Primer sequences used for PCR were as follows: HIF-1α, forward primer (GGAGATGTTAGCTCCCT) and reverse primer (AGTGGTGGCAGTGGTA); VEGF-A, forward primer (CGAAACCATGAACTTTCTGC) and reverse primer (CCTCAGTGGGCACACACTCC); Glut-1, forward primer (GCTACAACACTGGAGTCATC) and reverse primer (GGATCAGCATCTCAAAGGAC); PFK-2, forward primer (GGTGTGCGACGACCCTAC) and reverse primer (GTACACGATGCGGCTCTG); tubulin, forward primer (GAGTGCATCTCCATCCACGTT) and reverse primer (TAGAGCTCCCAGCAGGCATT). Real time PCR was carried out using the Syber Green method with the Stratagene system. The reactions were cycled 40 times after initial polymerase activation (50 °C, 2 min) and initial denaturation (95 °C, 15 min) using the following parameters: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 12 s, and extension at 60 °C for 20 s. A final cycle of fusion (95 °C, 30 s; 60 °C, 30 s; 95 °C, 30 s) terminated these reactions. The standard curve demonstrated a linear relationship between the cycle threshold (Ct) values and the cDNA concentration. The relative expression of each gene was assessed by considering the Ct values and efficiency of the primers and then normalized using the expression levels of tubulin. Statistics−Statistical analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance test, followed by a post hoc Tukey’s test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Results are presented as means ± S.D. Kinetics of HIF-1α Expression following UVB Irradiation−To determine whether UVB irradiation could play a role on HIF-1α expression level and activity, we first analyzed HIF-1α protein levels in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes using Western blot analysis. Results showed a dramatic decrease of HIF-1α protein immediately (≤0.5 h) after irradiation, followed by a gradual increase from 2.5 to 10 h postirradiation (Fig. 1A). The biphasic variation in HIF-1α protein level was correlated with the variation of HIF-1α DNA binding measured by a TransAM™ HIF-1α enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Fig. 1B). In order to test whether HIF-1α was modified at the transcriptional level, we performed real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR on HIF-1α mRNA. As shown in Fig. 1C, a near mirror effect on the respective levels of protein and HIF-1α mRNA was observed. Indeed, HIF-1α mRNA significantly decreased, whereas the protein increased (from 5 to 10 h postirradiation). Taken together, our results suggest that the variations in the amount of HIF-1α protein observed in response to irradiation may occur through the regulation of the protein synthesis or stability. ROS Involvement in HIF-1α Variations following UVB Irradiation−Since ROS generated via cytoplasmic or mitochondrial complexes have been described to be involved in HIF-1α protein degradation or stabilization in response to hypoxia, respectively (19.Kietzmann T. Gorlach A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 33.Michiels C. Minet E. Mottet D. Raes M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), we wondered whether ROS generation could be responsible for the biphasic effect of UVB irradiation on HIF-1α. To this end, we measured both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial steady-state level of ROS in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes, using CM-H2DCF-DA and MitoSOX probes, respectively (Fig. 2A; see also supplemental Fig. S1). UVB irradiation induced an immediate strong cytoplasmic ROS accumulation, which rapidly declined to basal levels 1 h postirradiation. A second progressive and more moderate increase in cytoplasmic ROS level was observed from 3 to 9 h postirradiation (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1A). By contrast, measurement of mitochondrial ROS showed a single peak from 1 to 3 h after UVB (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1B). These results suggest that intracellular ROS production in response to UVB irradiation is a complex biphasic and compartmented process that could be linked to the biphasic degradation and accumulation of HIF-1α in irradiated keratinocytes. To further investigate the respective effects of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS on HIF-1α protein modulation, we used either transduced keratinocytes overexpressing antioxidant enzymes, including catalase, CuZn-SOD, or Mn-SOD (see supplemental Fig. S2), or cells treated with diphenylene iodonium (DPI; 2.5 μm), an inhibitor of cytoplasmic NADPH oxidase, or N-acetyl cysteine (NAC; 10 mm), a precursor of glutathione that is the substrate of glutathione peroxidases. It is worthy of mention that catalase, CuZn-SOD, and Mn-SOD locate in peroxisomes, cytoplasm, and mitochondria, respectively, and that glutathione peroxidase is present in both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments (34.Mates J.M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 83-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). First of all, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ROS levels were analyzed at various times after irradiation (Fig. 2, B and C). Measurement of cytoplasmic ROS indicated a significant decrease in endogenous ROS levels in nonirradiated conditions in the different keratinocytes as compared with nontreated cells. Following irradiation, catalase and Mn-SOD overexpression as well as NAC treatment prevented the late increase in cytoplasmic ROS levels without abrogation of the first peak. In contrast, pretreatment of keratinocytes with DPI inhibited the initial peak in cytoplasmic ROS levels but did not affect the late increase. The CuZn-SOD overexpression had no significant effect on ROS levels following irradiation. Assessment of mitochondrial ROS showed that only Mn-SOD overexpression or NAC treatment prevented increase in mitochondrial ROS after irradiation. Overall, data suggest that the source of the primary increase in ROS levels is mostly dependent on the activity of a cytoplasmic NADPH oxidase, whereas the second increase in ROS levels originates from mitochondria. Next, the HIF-1α protein level was analyzed after irradiation of transduced or treated keratinocytes. Results showed that neither catalase nor CuZn-SOD overexpression affected the biphasic profile of HIF-1α expression. By contrast, overexpression of mitochondrial Mn-SOD completely abrogated the increase of HIF-1α normally observed 10 h postirradiation (Fig. 2D) without affecting the early decrease of HIF-1α. These results suggested a role for the mitochondrial ROS in HIF-1α stability after irradiation. Blocking the late accumulation of HIF-1α following irradiation upon pretreatment with NAC further confirmed this notion. Interestingly, DPI treatment of keratinocytes prior to irradiation completely abrogated the immediate HIF-1α down-regulation in response to UVB but did not affect its late accumulation. Taken together, these data suggest that ROS generated by NADPH oxidase activity in the cytoplasm immediately after UVB irradiation participates in HIF-1α down-regulation. In contrast, the transient later production of mitochondrial ROS is involved in the long lasting HIF-1α stabilization and accumulation. Effect of UVB Irradiation on the Phosphorylation Status of HIF-1α−In addition to the variations of HIF-1α protein level, UVB irradiation modified the migration pattern of HIF-1α (Fig. 1A and 2D), suggesting that UVB could affect post-translational modifications. In order to better characterize the different protein bands, we treated protein extracts from irradiated and nonirradiated keratinocytes with alkaline phosphatase. Converting the upper band into the lower migrating band upon phosphatase treatment indicated that this band, which appears after irradiation, corresponds to a phosphorylated form of the protein (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the irradiation of keratinocytes with increasing doses of UVB demonstrated a dose-dependent accumulation of the phosphorylated form of HIF-1α (Fig. 3B). We looked at the p53 and the serine 15-phosphorylated p53 accumulation as a control for the dose response of cells to irradiation (Fig. 3B). Since several studies showed that both UV and hypoxia can activate the MAPK signaling cascade, including ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK pathways (19.Kietzmann T. Gorlach A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 16: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 33.Michiels C. Minet E. Mottet D. Raes M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 35.Bode A.M. Dong Z. Sci STKE 2003. 2003; : RE2Google Scholar, 36.Semenza G.L.

Mechta-Grigoriou F. Cell. 2004; 118: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), these regulators could influence HIF-1α phosphorylation. To address this issue, keratinocytes were treated with ERK, p38 MAPK, or JNK inhibitors prior to UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3C, all inhibitors used were efficient in inhibiting its own pathway. Regarding the HIF-1α expression, ERK inhibitor had no effect on its status at any time after irradiation. By contrast, JNK and p38 MAPK were obviously required for the accumulation of HIF-1α, since their inhibition prevented up-regulation of HIF-1α in the phosphorylated and also nonphosphorylated forms. Interestingly, nonirradiated keratinocytes treated with either p38 or JNK inhibitors exhibited a lower amount of phosphorylated HIF-1α in comparison with nontreated cells, which suggested that both kinases are also involved in phosphorylation of HIF-1α. To further confirm the role of MAPK in the phosphorylation of HIF-1α following irradiation, we analyzed HIF-1α status in keratinocytes after inhibition of HIF-1α degradation. To this aim, keratinocytes were treated with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, and then were subjected to different MAPK inhibitors (Fig. 3D). Assessment of HIF-1α protein following irradiation indicated that in the presence of MG132 and inhibitor of either p38 or JNK kinase, HIF-1α was not phosphorylated. However, the amount of HIF-1α in this condition was lower than that found in cells treated only with MG132. Taken together, these results confirm that activation of p38 MAPK and JNK1 is required for accumulation of HIF-1α in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. To determine whether the activation of MAPKs was mediated through UVB-induced ROS production, activation of ERK, p38, and JNK was assessed by Western blot analysis in catalase-, CuZn-SOD-, and Mn-SOD-transduced cells and NAC- or DPI-treated keratinocytes (Fig. 2D). Our results indicated a clear decrease in the activation of those three MAPK pathways following irradiation in both Mn-SOD-transduced cells and NAC-treated keratinocytes. In contrast, catalase overexpression resulted in selectively decreased ERK activation. Neither overexpression of CuZn-SOD nor the treatment with DPI provided a significant effect in UVB-induced ROS-mediated MAPK activation. Overall, our results show that the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK through UVB-induced mitochondrial ROS production is required fo"

Drosophila 's long-germ fate map is established largely by the activity of the dipteran-specific Bicoid (Bcd) morphogen gradient, which operates both instructively and permissively to accomplish anterior patterning. By contrast, all nondipteran long-germ insects must achieve anterior patterning independently of bcd . We show that bcd 's permissive function is mimicked in the wasp by a maternal repression system in which anterior localization of the wasp ortholog of giant represses anterior expression of the trunk gap genes so that head and thorax can properly form."
https://openalex.org/W2077601612,"The clinical immunosuppressant FTY720 is a sphingosine analogue that, once phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 (Sphk2), is an agonist of multiple receptor subtypes for sphingosine 1-phosphate. Short exposures to FTY720 afford long term protection in lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease models, presumably by inducing apoptosis in subsets of cells essential for pathogenesis. Sphingosine itself is pro-apoptotic, and apoptosis induced with FTY720 or sphingosine is thought to proceed independently of their phosphorylation. Following chemical mutagenesis of Jurkat cells we isolated mutants that are selectively resistant to FTY720 analogue AAL(R), as well as natural sphingolipid bases, including sphingosine. Cells lacking functional Sphk2 were resistant to apoptosis induced with AAL(R), indicating that apoptosis proceeds through AAL(R) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of AAL(R) was also required for induction of lymphocyte apoptosis in mice, as apoptosis was not induced with the non-phosphorylatable chiral analogue, AAL(S). Apoptosis was induced in the spleen but not the thymus of mice administered 1 mg/kg AAL(R), correlating with levels of AAL(R)-phosphate (AFD(R)) in organ extracts. AFD(R) did not induce apoptosis when added to the cell culture medium, indicating that it induces apoptosis through an intracellular target. NBD-labeled AAL(R) localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and AAL(R) treatment resulted in elevated cytosolic calcium, Bax redistribution from cytosol to mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum membranes, and caspase-independent mitochondrial permeabilization in Jurkat cells. We therefore describe an apoptotic pathway triggered by intracellular accumulation of sphingolipid base phosphates and suggest that sphingoid base substrates for Sphk2 acting intracellularly could be useful in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases.

The sphingolipids are a class of lipids characterized by a serine head group with one or two fatty acyl tails. The common constituent of all sphingolipids is the long chain base (LCB), 3The abbreviations used are: LCB, long chain base; AAL(R), 2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutanol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LC-MS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; Sphk, sphingosine kinase; Sphk1, sphingosine kinase 1; Sphk2, sphingosine kinase 2; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FS, frameshift; Ctrl, control; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); SBR, sphingoid base resistant; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone.3The abbreviations used are: LCB, long chain base; AAL(R), 2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutanol; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LC-MS, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; S1P, sphingosine 1-phosphate; Sphk, sphingosine kinase; Sphk1, sphingosine kinase 1; Sphk2, sphingosine kinase 2; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; FS, frameshift; Ctrl, control; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; NBD, 12-(N-methyl-N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)); SBR, sphingoid base resistant; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone. and the most commonly occurring LCBs in mammals are sphingosine (Fig. 1A) and dihydrosphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 (Sphk1 and Sphk2), yielding sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), which has mitogenic and pro-survival properties (1Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 2Taha T.A. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 39: 113-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramides are the N-acylated precursors of sphingosine, generated either through the breakdown of the abundant membrane lipid sphingomyelin, or through de novo synthesis of sphingolipids from palmitoyl coenzyme A and serine. Ceramides have been widely implicated in apoptosis, leading to the proposal of a sphingolipid rheostat, with pro-survival S1P at one end and pro-apoptotic ceramide at the other (1Ogretmen B. Hannun Y.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Sphingosine itself is pro-apoptotic when added exogenously to cells, and its levels are elevated in response to a number of pro-apoptotic stimuli, including anti-Fas, tumor necrosis factor, and dexamethasone (3Cuvillier O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Lepine S. Lakatos B. Courageot M.P. Le Stunff H. Sulpice J.C. Giraud F. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 3783-3790Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). S1P is secreted from cells, following phosphorylation of sphingosine on internal membranes, and may act in an auto-crine or a paracrine fashion to affect a diverse array of physiological processes, including maturation and survival of the vasculature, trafficking of lymphocytes through blood, lymph, and secondary lymphoid organs, inflammation, and cell transformation (2Taha T.A.

These effects of S1P are mediated in large part through the activation of a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors, termed S1P1-S1P5. A number of effects have also been attributed to S1P acting through unidentified intracellular targets (2Taha T.A. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 39: 113-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Release of caged S1P inside the cell was shown to induce calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, an effect that was not seen with S1P released on the outside of the cell (6Meyer Zu Heringdorf D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 92: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using S1P receptor-deficient fibroblasts in combination with inhibition of G-protein signaling, Olivera et al.

Furthermore, whereas overexpression of Sphk1 enhances cell proliferation and survival, overexpression of Sphk2 has been shown to inhibit proliferation and enhance apoptosis in response to a number of pro-apoptotic agents or serum withdrawal (8Igarashi N.

The sphingosine analogue FTY720 is a promising novel immunosuppressant that is currently in Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

FTY720-phosphate is a high potency agonist of four of the five S1P receptors: S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5, and immunosuppression is the result of this compound's binding to S1P1 (5Rosen H. Goetzl E.J.

FTY720 showed considerable promise in the prevention of transplant rejection, is effective in a number of autoimmune diseases, and is in clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (12Chiba K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2005; 108: 308-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In addition to its immediate immunosuppressive effects, a short course of FTY720 affords long term protection against the lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disease caused by Fas deficiency in MRL-lpr/lpr mice (18Suzuki S.

The efficacy of FTY720 against solid tumors and lymphoproliferative diseases is most likely the result of an induction of apoptosis in the target cells. The precise molecular basis for the induction of apoptosis with FTY720 remains unknown, although a number of mechanisms have been suggested. Several reports have described induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition and consequent activation of caspases by FTY720, with modulation of these processes by the mitochondrial gatekeeper Bcl-2 family proteins (20Yasui H. Hideshima T. Raje N. Roccaro A.M. Shiraishi N. Kumar S. Hamasaki M. Ishitsuka K. Tai Y.T. Podar K. Catley L. Mitsiades C.S. Richardson P.G. Albert R. Brinkmann V. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C.

Other reports have described a down-modulation of pro-survival mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathways, and up-regulation of stress-activated kinases such as p38 (26Matsuoka Y.

In this study we have used a combination of genetic and chemical biology approaches to investigate the molecular basis for induction of apoptosis with the FTY720 analogue 2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutanol (AAL(R)). We show that phosphorylation of AAL(R) by Sphk2 is an absolute requirement for its induction of apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, that inactivation of Sphk2 reduces the apoptotic potency of endogenous LCBs including sphingosine, and that apoptosis is driven by intracellular LCB phosphates, most likely formed at the ER. We therefore describe an apoptotic pathway in mammalian cells, with potential in the treatment of cancer, that is triggered by phosphorylation of long chain bases. Cell Culture and Transfection—Jurkat and HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000, using 4 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine to transfect 106 cells. Jurkat cells transfected with the pIRES-EGFP vector were selected with 0.8 mg/ml G418 for 2-3 weeks, after which the cells were sorted for EGFP expression by flow cytometry. Assays were performed with cells sorted for equal EGFP expression. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Mutagenesis—Jurkat cells were mutagenized at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml, by treatment with 4 μg/ml ICR191 (Sigma) for 48 h (32Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 278: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The medium was replaced and the cells were allowed to recover for 5-6 days before the next round of mutagenesis. Following three rounds of mutagenesis, the cells were treated for 48 h with 10 μm AAL(R), then plated into 96-well plates to isolate surviving clonal lines. PCR and Vector Construction—Primers AGCTCGTGGAGATCTATTCATGGATCCAGCGGGCGG (forward) and GCTGTGCGGCGAATTCTCATAAGGGCTCTTCTGGCGGTGG (reverse), and TCCCGTTGAGAATTCAGAGCAGAGGACCAGCAGATGAAT (forward) and CGACGGGGATCCAGCTTGTTTAGTTTCAGGGCTCCC (reverse) were used for amplification of SPHK1 and SPHK2, respectively, from human endothelial cDNA. PCR products were cloned into the pCR-TOPO 2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced, before subcloning into the pIRES-EGFP expression vector (Clontech). Internal SPHK2 sequence primers TGTCTGCTCCGAGGACTGCCA and ACGGGTGAGTGTAGAGCTGCCT were used for sequencing of SPHK2. Detection of Frameshift Mutations in SPHK2—SPHK2 cDNA was amplified from SBR1 cells and sequenced. Two frameshifting mutations were identified as single base insertions that caused a mixed signal. To confirm that these mutations occurred on opposite alleles of the SBR1 SPHK2 gene, a PCR assay was employed. The following primers were used: 5′ control (Ctrl), CCATGGCCCCGCCCCCA; 5′ frameshifted (FS), CATGGCCCCGCCCCCCA; 3′ Ctrl, TCTGTGCCTGTAGCGGCCCAT; 3′ FS, GTGCCTGTAGCGGCCCCA. SPHK2 was amplified from cDNA with 36 cycles, using 62 °C annealing for the 5′ Ctrl/3′ Ctrl primer pair, and 64 °C for the 5′ FS/3′ Ctrl, 5′ Ctrl/3′ FS, and 5′ FS/3′ FS primer pairs. SPHK2 could be amplified from SBR1 cDNA using only the 5′ FS/3′ Ctrl and 5′ Ctrl/3′ FS primer pairs, whereas only the 5′ Ctrl/3′ Ctrl primer pair amplified SPHK2 from control Jurkat cDNA. Cell Viability/Apoptosis Assays—For MTT and caspase-3/7 assays, Jurkat cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well into a 96-well plate, and treated for 18 h with compounds. MTT assays were performed with an ATCC assay kit, exactly as described in the product information. Caspase-3/7 assays were performed with a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega), according to the product information. AAL(R) and AAL(S) (kindly provided by Dr. V. Brinkmann, Novartis, Basel) were dissolved at 20 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide, then diluted in water for addition to cells. Sphingosine, dihydrosphingosine, and phytosphingosine (Avanti Polar Lipids) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 2 mm, and delivered in dimethyl sulfoxide, to a final concentration of 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide. S1P (Biomol) and AFD(R) (V. Brinkmann) were dissolved in methanol at 1 mm, and added to the cells as a complex with 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Measurement of Apoptosis in Cultured Splenocytes and in Vivo; MEF Cells—Splenocytes were isolated by grinding spleens between frosted glass slides, followed by a single round of red blood cell lysis with 0.17 m NH4Cl for 5 min on ice. Cells were resuspended in RPMI, 10% fetal bovine serum, treated for 18 h with compounds at 37 °C, then incubated on ice with 1 μg/ml propidium iodide and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. Viability was scored as the proportion of cells excluding propidium iodide, then normalized to 100% for the vehicle-treated cells. Sphk1-/- (33Allende M.L. Sasaki T. Kawai H. Olivera A.

AAL(R) and AAL(S) were administered by intraperitoneal injection in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide to 3-month-old male MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice. Spleen, inguinal lymph nodes, and thymus were homogenized and filtered through 40-μm sieves. Spleen was subjected to red blood cell lysis as above. Lymphocytes were resuspended in 0.1 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 and incubated for 15 min with 1:50 annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (BD Pharmingen) and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, after which the volume was increased to 0.3 ml and the cells were analyzed with an LSRII cytometer (BD Biosciences), and FlowJo software (Treestar). WT (+/+) and knock-out (-/-) MEF cells were derived from day 13.5 embryos of a single Sphk2+/- female bred with a Sphk2+/- male. Head and liver were removed, and the remaining tissue was digested in 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution (Invitrogen) on ice for 6 h, then at 37 °C for 30 min, after which the embryonic cells were dissociated by pipetting, and plated in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Mice were genotyped as described (34Mizugishi K. Yamashita T. Olivera A. Miller G.F. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 11113-11121Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Measurement of Lipids by Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)—Cells were incubated at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml with 5 μm AAL(R) for 4 h or 5 μm sphingosine for 2 h at 37 °C. AFD(R) or S1P formation was determined to be linear with respect to time over this time frame in Jurkat cells. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, then extracted into 0.1 ml of ice-cold methanol. Extracts were cleared at 21,800 × g for 15 min and run over a Zorbax SB-C18 column (Agilent) at 0.35 ml/min, loading in 0.1% formic acid, 15% acetonitrile, and increasing to 98% acetonitrile over 15 min. An Agilent 1100 single quadrapole mass spectrometer was used. To extract AAL(R) and AFD(R) from spleen and thymus, the organs were homogenized with a Biospec Products Mini-BeadBeater in 0.5 ml of cold methanol. Extracts were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C on a platform rocker, then cleared at 21,800 × g for 20 min. Spiked controls were used to estimate compound recovery from spleen and thymus.

Sphk1 activity was measured in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP; and Sphk2 activity in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm ATP (36Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Reactions were started with the addition of 25 μg of Jurkat lysate protein. The 50-μl reactions were extracted with the addition of 50 μl of 1 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.5, followed by 250 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1), then cleared at 15,000 × g for 1 min. NBD fluorescence was read using 100 μl of upper aqueous phase, combined with 100 μl of dimethylformamide. Reactions containing no enzyme were used for blanks, and fluorescence units were converted to nanomoles of S1P using NBD-S1P standards extracted as described above. NBD-sphingosine and NBD-S1P were from Avanti Polar Lipids. To assay inhibition of Sphk1 in vitro, HEK293 lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection with Sphk1 expression plasmid. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Sphk2—SPHK2, full-length or truncated, was subcloned into the pMAL-c2E vector (New England Biolabs). Maltose-binding protein-Sphk2 (MBP-Sphk2) fusion proteins were produced from 200 ml of bacterial cultures, as described in the pMAL-c2E product manual. Maltose-binding protein-Sphk2 fusion protein was soluble, and stable when stored at -20 °C in the presence of 50% glycerol. Activity was determined in Sphk2 selective assay buffer (as above), using 2 μg of recombinant protein/30-min reaction. Synthesis of AAL(R)-NBD—AAL(R)-NBD was synthesized as described (37Ettmayer P. Baumruker T. Guerini D. Mechtcheriakova D. Nussbaumer P. Streiff M.B. Billich A. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2006; 16: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), with the following modification: the key phenolic intermediate was alkylated with 1-azido-7-iodoheptane (80% yield), followed by quantitative reduction of the azide group to the primary amine, which was then reacted with NBD-Cl. The t-butoxycarbonyl group was cleaved to afford the NBD-labeled (R)-AAL derivative. Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells, seeded overnight on glass coverslips, were incubated for 1 h with 10 μm NBD-AAL(R). The cells were then washed once and incubated in fresh growth medium for 1 h, with ER Tracker Red (2 μm), Lysotracker Red (75 nm), or Mitotracker Deep Red (50 nm) (all from Molecular Probes) added for the final 30 min. The cells were washed once more, and immediately imaged (in growth medium at room temperature) with an Olympus FV500 confocal microscope. Western Blotting and Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were treated at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and either lysed directly in Laemmli buffer, or resuspended in fractionation buffer: 200 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cells were broken with 50 passes through a 27-gauge needle, then centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g to pellet nuclei and unbroken cells, followed by 4,000 and 22,000 × g spins to pellet mitochondrial and microsomal fractions. Proteins were resolved on 4-12% NU-PAGE gels (Invitrogen). Antibodies used included rabbit anti-Bax NT (Upstate), mouse anti-calnexin and mouse anti-TOM20 (BD Biosciences), and rabbit anti-PARP1 (Novus). Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—Jurkat cells were treated for 8 h with 5 μm AAL(R) or AAL(S), incubated for 30 min with 5 μm Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes), then washed and incubated for a further 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C, after which the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Geometric mean Fluo-3 fluorescence was determined for viable cells only, gated on the basis of light scatter. Isolation of AAL(R)-resistant Mutants—Jurkat cells were mutagenized with ICR191, then treated with the FTY720 analogue, AAL(R) (Fig. 1B), for 48 h to isolate resistant cells. Nine AAL(R)-resistant cell lines were derived from two distinct mutagenized pools. As we aimed to isolate mutants that were resistant to AAL(R) but not to all apoptosis inducing agents, the mutant cell lines were then tested by MTT assay for resistance to the DNA damaging agent etoposide, and anti-Fas antibody. Five mutants were found to be resistant to AAL(R) but not etoposide or anti-Fas antibody. The viability curves for three such mutants, designated SBR1-3 (sphingoid base resistant), are shown in Fig. 2, A-C. Induction of Apoptosis with AAL(R) Requires Phosphorylation by Sphk2—These cell lines were assayed for their capacity to phosphorylate AAL(R) in culture, using LC-MS to detect AAL(R) and the phosphorylated derivative AFD(R). Mutant SBR1 was unable to phosphorylate AAL(R) (Fig. 2D). Several publications have reported that FTY720 is phosphorylated efficiently by Sphk2, but not by Sphk1 (15Kharel Y. Lee S. Snyder A.H.

We investigated the anti-inflammatory activity of 17-AAG in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats. After the induction of EIU with a footpad injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), female Lewis rats received a single intraperitoneal. (i.p.) injection of 17-AAG or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, the retinas were extracted and assayed for leukocyte adhesion; blood-retinal barrier breakdown; VEGF, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and CD14 protein levels; NF-kappaB and HIF-1alpha activity; hsp90 and 70 levels and expression and phosphorylation of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and occludin. 17-AAG treatment significantly suppressed the LPS-induced increase in retinal leukocyte adhesion; vascular leakage; NF-kappaB, HIF-1alpha, p38, and PI-3K activity; and VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels. 17-AAG also suppressed phosphorylation of ZO-1 and occludin by inhibiting their association with p38 and PI-3K. Although 17-AAG treatment did not reduce the LPS-induced increase in total CD14 levels in leukocytes, it significantly decreased membrane CD14 levels. These data suggest that Hsp90 inhibition suppresses several cardinal manifestations of endotoxin-induced uveitis in the rat. 17-AAG has demonstrated a favorable safety profile in clinical trials in cancer patients and represents a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of inflammatory eye diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2090185569,"It has become desirable to reduce the nonrenewable content and energy footprint of the built environment and to develop “smart buildings” that allow for inexpensive monitoring and self-diagnostic capabilities. Latest-generation embedded sensors, self-healing composites, and nanoscale and responsive materials may augur a time when buildings can substantially adjust to changing environmental and functional demands. However, faced with the legal liability resulting from unknown lifetime performance, designers and engineers have had little incentive to incorporate new material technologies into building designs. As efficiency issues become more acute, the potential for improvement in performance from new materials, together with partnerships between the materials science community and those entrusted with the design and engineering of the built environment, may offer real breakthroughs for the future."
https://openalex.org/W2052724657,"The frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events is projected to change in response to global warming. Here we show that these hydrologic changes may have a profound effect on mosquito population dynamics and rates of mosquito-borne disease transmission. We develop a simple model, which treats the mosquito reproductive cycle as a phase oscillator that responds to rainfall frequency forcing. This model reproduces observed mosquito population dynamics and indicates that mosquito-borne disease transmission can be sensitive to rainfall frequency. These findings indicate that changes to the hydrologic cycle, in particular the frequency of moderate to heavy rainfall events, could have a profound effect on the transmission rates of some mosquito-borne diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2001928918,"SNARE proteins form bundles of four α-helical SNARE domains with conserved polar amino acids, 3Q and 1R, at the “0-layer” of the bundle. Previous studies have confirmed the importance of 3Q·1R for fusion but have not shown whether it regulates SNARE complex assembly or the downstream functions of assembled SNAREs. Yeast vacuole fusion requires regulatory lipids (ergosterol, phosphoinositides, and diacylglycerol), the Rab Ypt7p, the Rab-effector complex HOPS, and 4 SNAREs: the Q-SNAREs Vti1p, Vam3p, and Vam7p and the R-SNARE Nyv1p. We now report that alterations in the 0-layer Gln or Arg residues of Vam7p or Nyv1p, respectively, strongly inhibit fusion. Vacuoles with wild-type Nyv1p show exquisite discrimination for the wild-type Vam7p over Vam7Q283R, yet Vam7Q283R is preferred by vacuoles with Nyv1R191Q. Rotation of the position of the arginine in the 0-layer increases the Km for Vam7p but does not affect the maximal rate of fusion. Vam7Q283R forms stable 2Q·2R complexes that do not promote fusion. However, fusion is restored by the lipophilic amphiphile chlorpromazine or by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, perturbants of the lipid phase of the membrane.

Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 631-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1942) Google Scholar) are vital for membrane fusion. Initially discovered in neuronal tissues, SNAREs are found on all organelles of the exocytic and endocytic pathways, from yeast to humans. Their characteristic feature is a heptad-repeat “SNARE domain,” flanked by varied N-domains and by C-terminal membrane anchors, either a single membrane-spanning apolar polypeptide or an acyl anchor. SNAREs form 4-helical complexes through their SNARE domains (2Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). Although the residues in each SNARE that face the others in a 4-helical complex are generally apolar, 3 glutamine (Q) and 1 arginine (R) near the center of the 4-complexed SNARE domains form a conserved and polar “0-layer” (3Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Recombinant neuronal SNAREs spontaneously assemble into stable bundles, yet SNARE complex assembly in vivo requires SNARE-binding proteins of the Sec1-Munc18 “SM” family. SNARE complexes are disassembled by two chaperones: Sec17p/α-SNAP, which binds directly to SNARE complexes, and Sec18p/NSF, which binds to Sec17p/α-SNAP and couples the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to SNARE complex disassembly (4Soöllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). SNARE complexes form in cis, with each SNARE anchored to the same membrane, or in trans, with SNAREs anchored to apposed, “tethered” membranes. SNARE function has been studied in vivo, on isolated organelles, and through the reconstitution of recombinant SNAREs into proteoliposomes. When several SNAREs, which are found in vivo on a “target” membrane, are co-reconstituted into one population of liposomes, they form a t-SNARE complex. These liposomes can selectively interact with other liposomes bearing a reconstituted “vesicle,” or v-, SNARE to allow selective lipid mixing (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B.

The proteins (Ypt7p, HOPS, and SNAREs) and lipids (phosphoinositides, ergosterol, and diacylglycerol), which are required for fusion undergo striking, interdependent enrichment at a ring-shaped microdomain, termed the “vertex ring,” which surrounds the boundary membrane (22Wang L.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Ypt7p and HOPS are needed for SNARE complex assembly, and HOPS is an integral part of the assembled SNARE complex (26Collins K.M. Thorngren N.L. Fratti R.A. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1775-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Fusion occurs around the vertex ring, joining the outside membrane from each vacuole to form the larger, fused organelle and joining the two apposed boundary membrane discs to yield a luminal vesicle (22Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Merz A.J. Wickner W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three of these have C-terminal trans-membrane anchors, but Vam7p has no apolar membrane anchor. Whereas most purified SNAREs require detergent for their solubility, and thus cannot be directly added to purified organelles without causing lysis, recombinant Vam7p is water-soluble without detergent and supports vacuole fusion (30Thorngren N.

Jackson M.B. Science. 2004; 304: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), or act by other means. Studies of integral membrane SNAREs in the context of their native membrane and organelle are limited to producing and characterizing mutants, which may have significant effects on organelle composition and cell growth. The vacuolar Vam7p SNARE affords a unique window into SNARE function, because its cloned recombinant form is functional for fusion in vitro, it can readily be expressed and purified in soluble recombinant form, and many subreaction assays of vacuole fusion are available. Vam7p is a Q-SNARE with an N-terminal PX (Phox homology) domain, which directly binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (36Cheever M.L. Sato T.K. de Beer T. Kutateladze T.G. Emr S.D. Overduin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and HOPS (19Stroupe C. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1579-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and a C-terminal SNARE domain. We now compare the functions of wild-type Vam7p with Vam7p bearing a Q283R mutation, changing the 0-layer Gln to Arg, in the context of purified vacuoles with the wild-type R-SNARE Nyv1p or with its 0-layer Arg changed to Gln. We find that the 3Q·1R rule (37Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15781-15786Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) is important but not inviolate. Substantial fusion is seen with SNARE complexes having “rotated” positions of the 3Q·1R or with 4Q complexes, each showing dramatically elevated Km for Vam7p but similar maximal rates of fusion. 2Q·2R SNAREs form SNARE complex without fusion, but substantial fusion can be restored by the addition of chlorpromazine or U73122. Either of these agents modifies the lipid bilayer, suggesting that 0-layer function is directly coupled to the lipid bilayer properties. Strains—The strains used for fusion assays were BJ3505 (MATα pep4::HIS3 prb1-Δ1.6R his3–200 lys2–801 trp1Δ101 (gal3) ura3–52 gal2 can1) (38Jones E.W.

The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pRS406-pNYV1 using XbaI and SacII sites, generating pRS406-pNYV1-NYV1. QuikChange mutagenesis (39Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) was used to generate pRS406-nyv1R192Q using the forward primer 5′-AACATCGACAAGTTCTTGGAGCAACAAGAAAGAGTTTCTTTATTGTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CACCAATAAAGAAACTCTTTCTTGTTGCTCCAAGAACTTGTCGATGTT-3′. RFY1 and RFY2 were generated by transforming BJ3505 nyv1Δ and DKY6281 nyv1Δ, respectively, with pRS406-nyv1R192Q by standard lithium acetate methods and plated on complete synthetic media lacking uracil.

Recombinant Vam7p—The VAM7 open reading frame, excluding the first methionine, was amplified from BY4742 chromosomal DNA using forward primer 5′-GCGGGATCCGCAGCTAATTCTGTAGGGAAA-3′ with a BamHI restriction site (bold), and reverse primer 5′-CGCGAATTCTCAAGCACTGTTGTTAAAATG-3′ with an EcoRI site. Digested PCR product was ligated to EcoRI/BamHI-linearized pET42a(+) to generate pET42a-GST·Vam7p. Sequenced plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta-2 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) and grown on Luria broth with kanamycin and chloramphenicol. Using pET42a-GST-VAM7 as a template, QuikChange mutagenesis was used to create VAM7Y42A, VAM7Q283R, and VAM7Y42A/Q283R. Forward primer 5′-AACAAGCGCCTTTACAAAAGGGCATCCGAGTTTTGGAAACTGAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTCAGTTTCCAAAACTCGGATGCCCTTTTGTAAAGGCGCTTGTT-3′ were used to make VAM7Y42A. To make VAM7Q283R we used 5′-GAGATGAACGAGGAGCTGCAAACACGGAATGAGCTACTTACAGCACTT-3′ and 5′-AAGTGCTGTAAGTAGCTCATTCCGTGTTTGCAGCTCCTCGTTCATCTC-3′. To express GST-Vam7, cultures were grown in 1 liter of Terrific broth at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6. Cells were induced with 500 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h, collected by centrifugation, and washed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm Pefabloc-SC, 1 μm leupeptin, and 5 μm pepstatin). Cells were lysed by 3 passages through a French pressure cell. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (60 min, 45,000 rpm, 4 °C, Beckman 60-Ti rotor). Supernatants were incubated with GSH-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer (16 h, 4 °C, nutating). Resin was washed with 20 column volumes of lysis buffer. GST-Vam7p was eluted with lysis buffer containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Proteins were dialyzed against PS buffer with 125 mm KCl and 5 mm MgCl2. Vacuole Isolation and in Vitro Fusion Assay—Vacuoles were isolated from the yeast strains BJ3505 (38Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 351: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and DKY6281 (16Haas A. Conradt B. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fusion reactions (30 μl) contained 3 μg of BJ3505 vacuoles with inactive pro-Pho8p (pro-alkaline phosphatase) and lacking the protease Pep4p, 3 μg of DKY6281 vacuoles containing Pep4p but lacking Pho8p, standard fusion reaction buffer (125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 6.8, 200 mm sorbitol), ATP regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine kinase), 10 μm coenzyme A (18Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and 930 nm IB2 (inhibitor of protease B). After 90 min at 27 °C, Pho8p activity was assayed in 250 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, 0.4% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. One unit of fusion is 1 μmol of p-nitrophenolate produced per min per μg of BJ3505 vacuoles. p-Nitrophenolate absorbance was measured at 400 nm. Because Vam7p has no apolar membrane anchor, it can be produced in bacteria, purified in the absence of detergent, and added to in vitro fusion assays. To assess the role of the Vam7p C-terminal SNARE domain, we mutated its zero-layer glutamine to arginine (Q283R) to disrupt the 3Q·1R ratio. As a first test of this mutant Vam7p, we mixed bacterially expressed recombinant Vam7p or Vam7pQ283R with the recombinant soluble cytoplasmic domains of Vti1p and Vam3p prior to introducing vacuoles and assaying vacuole fusion. The mixed soluble domains of the three Q-SNAREs interact directly with Nyv1p to form nonfunctional SNARE bundles and block vacuole fusion (43Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although this inhibition requires all three of the Q-SNARE-soluble domains, it is simpler than the physiological SNARE complex assembly, because it bypasses regulation by Ypt7p (43Jun Y. Thorngren N. Starai V.J. Fratti R.A. Collins K. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5260-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of the mixed soluble domains of the t-SNAREs was undiminished by violation of the 3Q·1R rule or by another mutation, which we characterize in detail elsewhere, 5Fratti, R. A., and Wickner, W. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 13133–13138. that disrupts the affinity of Vam7p for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (Fig. 1). Because Vam7pQ283R can still interact with other SNAREs to regulate fusion, it warranted further characterization. Fusion Activity of Vam7Q283R Protein—Although the other, integral-membrane SNAREs are present on isolated vacuoles in the unpaired state as well as in SNARE complexes, all the Vam7p on purified vacuoles appears to be in cis-SNARE complexes (26Collins K.M. Thorngren N.L. Fratti R.A. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1775-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In standard fusion reactions with ATP, the disassembly of these complexes by Sec18p and Sec17p provides the Vam7p for trans-SNARE complex formation. For this reason, the requirement for Sec18p/Sec17p and for ATP can be bypassed by added Vam7p (30Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We first tested the effects of adding recombinant wild-type and mutant Vam7p to our standard fusion reaction, which does not required exogenously added Vam7p. The addition of either wild-type Vam7p, Vam7pQ283R, or other mutants had little effect on fusion (Fig. 2A). Recombinant wild-type Vam7p can “bypass” the need for priming, the disassembly of cis-SNARE complexes, by forming complexes with the unpaired vacuolar SNAREs (30Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In bypass fusion assays, priming is blocked by either the absence of ATP or, in the presence of ATP, by antibody to Sec17p. Although wild-type Vam7p supported bypass fusion (circles, Fig. 2, B and C), Vam7pQ283R did not support the bypass fusion of wild-type vacuoles (triangles, Fig. 2, B and C). These assays allow direct determination of whether Vam7pQ283R can compete with wild-type Vam7p. Even when Vam7p and Vam7Q283R were premixed prior to addition to vacuoles, a 100-fold excess of Vam7pQ283R only gave modest inhibition of Vam7p-supported fusion (Fig. 3). In these studies, Vam7pQ283R was added at up to micromolar levels, a large excess over the endogenous Vam7p (30Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because Vam7pQ283R binds to vacuoles as well as wild-type Vam7p (data not shown) but does not support fusion (Fig. 2, B and C), vacuoles show exquisite discrimination for Vam7p with the normal Gln residue at the 0-layer position.FIGURE 3Vacuoles discriminate between Vam7p and Vam7pQ283R according to the 0-layer. Vacuoles blocked for priming with α-Sec17p antibody or by ATP omission (30Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were incubated with indicated amounts of premixed wild-type Vam7p and Vam7pQ283R. Reactions were incubated for 90 min, and fusion was measured by alkaline phosphatase activity. Data represent mean fusion ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Vam7pQ283R Stimulates the Fusion of Vacuoles Bearing Nyv1pR192Q—To test whether Vam7pQ283R is merely denatured or could under some circumstances form functional SNARE complexes, we replaced the 0-layer arginine of Nyv1p with a glutamine and purified vacuoles from yeast harboring Nyv1pR192Q. In a standard fusion reaction with ATP but without added Vam7p, vacuoles bearing Nyv1pR192Q were unable to fuse (Fig. 2D), suggesting that four Q-SNAREs are not readily primed (44Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In standard fusion reactions, the same Vam7pQ283R that was inert with vacuoles bearing the wild-type Nyv1p supported the fusion of Nyv1R192Q vacuoles with a Km of ∼50 nm (Fig. 2D). Surprisingly, wild-type Vam7p also promoted fusion of Nyv1R192Q with a similar Km, albeit only ∼60% as well as Vam7Q283R. Thus, as seen in other studies (45Graf C.T. Riedel D. Schmitt H.D. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the 3Q·1R rule is not inviolable; fusion can occur with four Q-SNAREs. When priming was blocked in the presence of ATP by the addition of anti-Sec17p, Vam7pQ283R or wild-type Vam7p supported fusion (Fig. 2E), as seen under standard fusion conditions (Fig. 2D). In the absence of ATP (Fig. 2F), Vam7Q283R promoted fusion of Nyv1pR192Q vacuoles whereas wild type Vam7p did not, just as vacuoles bearing wild type Nyv1p could only undergo bypass fusion with wild-type Vam7p (Fig. 2C). However, the concentration of Vam7Q283R needed for fusion of Nyv1pR192Q vacuoles was ∼100 times greater than with wild-type Vam7p and Nyv1p (Fig. 2, F versus C). It may take far more energy to form SNARE bundles containing both Vam7pQ283R and Nyv1pR192Q than with wild-type Vam7p and Nyv1p, even though both have 3Q·1R 0-layers. This is consistent with energy being needed to distort the SNARE α-helical backbone at the 0-layer to accommodate the altered positions of bulky arginine versus the less bulky glutamine, or with “proofreading” by a SNARE-bound factor such as HOPS. Once formed, these 3Q·1R complexes have the same capacity to promote fusion. A detailed examination of the specific protein and lipid requirements for fusion supported by each form of Vam7p, with wild-type vacuoles or Nyv1R192Q vacuoles, is presented in the supplemental Fig S1. Physical Interactions of Vam7p with SNAREs and HOPS—Because Vam7p mutant proteins bind to vacuoles in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type Vam7p yet differentially support fusion, we examined their capacities to form protein complexes with SNAREs and HOPS. For this study, vacuole fusion was blocked by antibody to Sec17p for 15 min, secondary inhibitors were added, and, after 5 min, the priming block was rescued by the addition of Vam7p (Fig. 4A). As reported (26Collins K.M. Thorngren N.L. Fratti R.A. Wickner W.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1775-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), wild-type Vam7p relieves the anti-Sec17p block to allow fusion (Fig. 4B, filled bars) and enters into complexes with SNARES and HOPS (Fig. 4C, left panel). These interactions were inhibited by antibodies to Vam3p or Vps33p. Strikingly, Vam7pQ283R, although it does not support the fusion of wild-type vacuoles (Figs. 2B, 2C, and 4B, open symbols), forms stable and isolable HOPS·SNARE complexes (Fig. 4C) which contained Nyv1p and are thus 2Q·2R. The formation of this complex is also inhibited by antibody to Vam3p or to the HOPS subunit Vps33p, the SM protein of the vacuole. Bypass of the 2Q·2R Block—Because Vam7pQ283R binds to vacuoles and enters SNARE complexes as readily as wild-type Vam7p, but with little or no consequent fusion, we sought conditions that might activate fusion in this 2Q·2R system when priming was blocked by either antibody to Sec17p or by the omission of ATP. Bypass fusion with Vam7pQ283R in the absence of ATP was restored by the addition of the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, but restoration was not seen in the presence of ATP (Fig. 5A). Strikingly, bypass fusion with Vam7pQ283R in the presence of ATP, when priming was blocked by antibody to Sec17p, was restored by the addition of chlorpromazine (Fig. 5B), and this restoration required ATP. In each case, the restored fusion required the normal fusion pathway, because it was blocked by characterized inhibitors that target SNAREs, Ypt7p, and HOPS. Even though bypass fusion with wild-type Vam7p is unaffected by ATP (30Thorngren N. Collins K.M. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. Merz A.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), ATP directly regulates the ability of U73122 or chlorpromazine to restore 2Q·2R fusion. To further examine this bypass, we characterized the effects of chlorpromazine on both the physical associations of added Vam7pQ283R as well as on the functional restoration of fusion for the same samples (Fig. 6). Chlorpromazine had no measurable effect on the binding of Vam7pQ283R to vacuoles (Fig. 6B, top panel). Chlorpromazine had only a small effect on the association of vacuolebound Vam7pQ283R with HOPS or with other SNAREs (Fig. 6B, lane 4 versus 5) but was absolutely required for fusion (Fig. 6C). In the presence of chlorpromazine, both the physical association of the Vam7pQ283R with HOPS and with SNAREs and the function of restored fusion were still dependent on the R-SNARE Nyv1p (Figs. 5, 6B (lane 8), and 6C), showing that fusion occurred using a 2Q·2R SNARE complex, and on Vam3p, Ypt7p, and the SM Vps33p subunit of HOPS (Fig. 6, B (lanes 7, 9–11) and C).FIGURE 6Chlorpromazine permits Vam7pQ283R to form normal complexes with SNAREs and HOPS. A, reaction scheme. B, fusion reactions were incubated with α-Sec17 to block priming. After 10 min, inhibitors were added and the mixture was incubated for 5 min before addition of 150 μm chlorpromazine (CPZ). Chlorpromazine was allowed to act for 5 min before addition of 100 nm Vam7pQ283R. Reactions were incubated for an additional 70 min, and then assayed for Vam7pQ283R-associated proteins as described in Fig. 4. C, fusion was determined by alkaline phosphatase activity. Bars represent mean fusion ± S.E. (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With vacuoles bearing the wild-type R-SNARE Nyv1p, Vam7pQ283R is inactive for fusion, yet forms an HOPS·SNARE complex of 2Q·2R composition. Vacuoles bearing Nyv1pR192Q can fuse when given either Vam7pQ283R, restoring the 3Q·1R composition of the 0-layer, or wild-type Vam7p, yielding a 4Q 0-layer. These findings are in accord with studies showing that 4Q SNARE complexes are functional for exocytosis (46Katz L. Brennwald P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3849-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi traffic (45Graf C.T. Riedel D. Schmitt H.D. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas 2Q·2R complexes are at least somewhat defective (45Graf C.T. Riedel D. Schmitt H.D. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2263-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with recombinant neuronal SNAREs have shown that the syntaxin 0-layer Gln is essential for NSF factor and α-SNAP-mediated SNARE bundle disassembly (44Scales S.J. Yoo B.Y. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14262-14267Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and this may account for some of the loss of fusion that accompanies mutation of the Vam3p 0-layer Gln to Arg in an earlier study (47Wang Y. Dulubova I. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28598-28605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, diminished disassembly of cis-SNARE complexes is not a factor in our current studies in which the action of Sec18p(NSF)/Sec17p(α-SNAP) is blocked, by antibody or by the absence of ATP. What is the role of the 0-layer in vacuole fusion? Our studies show that the composition of glutamine and arginine residues in the 0-layer and their precise spatial distribution control the energy needed to assemble functional SNARE complexes, because normal bypass fusion has a Km for Vam7p of only 3–8 nm, whereas far higher concentrations of mutant or wild-type Vam7p are needed for 4Q fusion (Fig. 2). Once formed, SNARE complexes with 2Q·2R are stable but inactive, yet fusion can be restored when the membrane is perturbed by the intercalating amphiphile chlorpromazine or by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. These may modulate bilayer properties such that a “weakened” 2Q·2R complex is still capable of driving fusion. Chlorpromazine is an amphipathic molecule that partitions into the negatively curved inner leaflets of membrane bilayers. Once intercalated into membranes, chlorpromazine alters the physical properties of bilayers. Upon insertion into inner leaflets, chlorpromazine deforms membranes to induce cupping (48Oghalai J.S. Zhao H.B. Kutz J.W. Brownell W.E. Science. 2000; 287: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and can alter lateral diffusion and membrane tension (48Oghalai J.S. Zhao H.B. Kutz J.W. Brownell W.E. Science. 2000; 287: 658-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In doing so, chlorpromazine reduces relaxation times of membrane tethers by lowering thresholds for remodeling. This was seen in force measurement experiments using optical tweezers to pull membranes (49Murdock D.R. Ermilov S.A. Spector A.A. Popel A.S. Brownell W.E. Anvari B. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 4090-4095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Membrane remodeling by chlorpromazine may also alter phosphoinositide metabolism by activating both phosphoinositide kinases and phospholipase C (50Raucher D. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3759-3766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these actions of chlorpromazine may lower the threshold for the bilayer rearrangements of fusion, permitting 2Q·2R SNARE complexes to function. Similarly, U73122 inhibits vacuolar phospholipase C activities (51Jun Y. Fratti R.A. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53186-53195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and thereby alters the ratio of two vacuolar lipids that are crucial for fusion, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Restoration of 2Q·2R fusion by chlorpromazine or U73122 is regulated by the presence or absence of ATP; one of the effects of ATP in this restoration may be to support phosphoinositide synthesis. SNAREs may promote membrane fusion by several means: 1) They may provide physical stress on the bilayer, which could lower the activation energy for lipid rearrangements for fusion (5Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Soöllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). 2) SNAREs are needed to gather lipids such as diacylglycerol, which promote the bilayer rearrangements of fusion, to the fusion site (25Fratti R.A. Jun Y. Merz A.J. Margolis N. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1087-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). 3) The trans-membrane domain of certain SNAREs will destabilize bilayers (33Langosch D. Crane J.M. Brosig B. Hellwig A. Tamm L.K. Reed J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 709-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 52Hofmann M.W. Peplowska K. Rohde J. Poschner B.C. Ungermann C. Langosch D. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 1048-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and SNARE-driven bilayer stress and destabilization can lead to the lipid rearrangements of lysis as well as fusion (7Dennison S.M. Bowen M.E. Brunger A.T. Lentz B.R. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 1661-1675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 8Chen X. Arac D. Wang T.M. Gilpin C.J. Zimmerberg J. Rizo J. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 2062-2074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). 4) SNAREs may also serve as a binding platform to localize and even activate other fusion factors, such as surface-active and calcium-triggered synaptotagmin or lipid-binding HOPS. Assays of each of these four separate SNARE contributions to fusion will be required to determine the importance of each means of SNARE action and the role of the 0-layer in their regulation. Our current findings suggest that SNARE 0-layer function is intimately tied to the lipid bilayer composition and physical properties. Download .pdf (.1 MB) Help with pdf files"

In human glomerular mesangial cells, Smad3 protein levels were specifically reduced by 24 h of TGF-β1 treatment, whereas Smad2 and Smad4 levels were not. TGF-β1 increased endogenous Smad3 ubiquitination, and proteasome inhibitor treatment blocked TGF-β1-mediated Smad3 down-regulation resulting in accumulation of ubiquitinated Smad3. These data support the concept that Smad3 down-regulation occurs via degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery. However, changes in Smad3 protein levels were also paralleled by changes in Smad3 mRNA expression. TGF-β1 did not decrease Smad3 mRNA stability, but it significantly inhibited Smad3 promoter activity. In renal tubular epithelial cells, decreased Smad3 levels were observed only after exposure to TGF-β1 for longer time periods (5–7 days) that paralleled epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as determined by increased expression of smooth muscle α-actin and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Decline in Smad3 expression also occurred in kidneys after unilateral ureteral obstruction, a model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis associated with TGF-β up-regulation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our data show for the first time that TGF-β1 modulates the expression of a receptor-activated Smad at both the protein and transcriptional level.

However, changes in Smad3 protein levels were also paralleled by changes in Smad3 mRNA expression. TGF-β1 did not decrease Smad3 mRNA stability, but it significantly inhibited Smad3 promoter activity. In renal tubular epithelial cells, decreased Smad3 levels were observed only after exposure to TGF-β1 for longer time periods (5–7 days) that paralleled epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, as determined by increased expression of smooth muscle α-actin and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Decline in Smad3 expression also occurred in kidneys after unilateral ureteral obstruction, a model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis associated with TGF-β up-regulation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Our data show for the first time that TGF-β1 modulates the expression of a receptor-activated Smad at both the protein and transcriptional level. Smad3 down-regulation could represent a feedback loop controlling TGF-β signaling in a cell phenotype-specific manner. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis are the consequences of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) 2The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction; α-SMA, smooth muscle α-actin. accumulation and lead to end-stage renal failure (1Liu Y.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates a variety of physiological and pathological processes in a cell type-specific manner and plays a central role in the development of fibrosis. In mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts, activated hepatic stellate cells, and glomerular mesangial cells, TGF-β leads to ECM accumulation (2Border W.A. Noble N.A.

TGF-β family receptors transduce signals to the nucleus through the Smads. These proteins are divided into receptor-regulated or R-Smads Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8; common-partner or co-Smad Smad4; and inhibitory Smads or I-Smads Smad6 and -7 (10Piek E.

A critical role for Smad3 as a mediator of fibrosis has been established using in vitro and in vivo models examining various tissues and organs (14Flanders K.C. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Using TGF-β1-treated human mesangial cells as our model for kidney fibrosis, we have shown that Smad3 is necessary for TGF-β1-stimulated α2(I) collagen (COL1A2) promoter activity (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, 24 h of TGF-β1 treatment decreases Smad3 levels in these cells (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that several members of the Smad protein family can be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (17Izzi L. Attisano L. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2071-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, only a few reports have examined Smad3 turnover. In addition, these studies were performed mainly with overexpressed proteins, with Smad3 ubiquitination observed in cells transfected with Smad3 and ubiquitin, in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor and/or overexpression of an E3 ubiquitin ligase (18Fukuchi M.

Here, we have investigated the regulation of the expression of endogenous Smad3, a central participant in the mechanisms by which TGF-β1 triggers events that contribute to fibrotic diseases. Our results indicate that both increased degradation and decreased promoter activity contribute to the TGF-β1-mediated decrease in Smad3 expression. Materials—Reagents were purchased from the following vendors. Active human recombinant TGF-β1 was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); rabbit anti-phospho-Smad3 (Ser-433/435) and mouse anti-ubiquitin from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); mouse anti-Smad4 (B-8), mouse anti-Smad1/2/3 (H-2), rabbit anti-Dab2, anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, and anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, luciferase, and β-galactosidase assay systems from Promega (Madison, WI); rabbit anti-Smad3, rabbit anti-Smad2, and protein G-Sepharose from Invitrogen and Zymed Laboratories Inc.; mouse anti-E-cadherin from BD Transduction Laboratories; actinomycin D, cycloheximide, proteasome inhibitor I, lactacystin, and Z-Leu-Leu-al (MG132) from Sigma. The Alk5/TβRI inhibitor SB-431542 (21Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol.

Stock solutions were made as follows: 4 μg/ml TGF-β1 in 4 mm HCl containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin; 10 mm proteasome inhibitor I, lactacystin, and MG132 in Me2SO; 1 mg/ml actinomycin D in Me2SO; 1 mg/ml cycloheximide in water. Cell Culture—Human glomerular mesangial cells were isolated and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with 20% newborn calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Hepes buffer, sodium pyruvate, 8 μg/ml insulin, and glutamine as described previously (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The renal tubular epithelial cell line HKC, obtained from Dr. L. Racusen (22Racusen L.C. Monteil C. Sgrignoli A. Lucskay M. Marouillat S. Rhim J.G. Morin J.P. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 318-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Hepes buffer, and glutamine. Animals—Male CD-1 mice that weighed ∼18–20 g were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley (Indianapolis, IN). Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was performed as described previously (23Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sham-operated mice had their ureters exposed and manipulated but not ligated. Mice were killed 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. Kidneys were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C before protein extractions. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were switched to medium containing 1% newborn calf serum (for mesangial cells) or 0.5% fetal bovine serum (for HKC) and treated with 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 for various time periods, leading to simultaneous harvest. In some experiments, the cells were incubated with inhibitors for 1 h prior to TGF-β1 treatment. The cells were lysed as described previously (16Poncelet A-C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Kidney tissues were homogenized, and proteins were extracted as described previously (23Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments, 500 μg of lysates were immunoprecipitated with 1.25 μg of anti-Smad3 antibody and 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting. Densitometric analysis was performed as described previously (24Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A-C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F413-F422Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot—Total RNA was harvested using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol and analyzed by Northern blot with cDNA probes for human Smad3 (25Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and bovine 28 S ribosomal RNA (provided by Dr. H. Sage, University of Washington, Seattle, WA) as described previously (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transfection was performed with the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science), and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured as previously described (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Runyan C.E. Schnaper H.W. Poncelet A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2632-2639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8–10 × 104 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. Eighteen hours later, the cells were switched to 1% newborn calf serum-containing medium and transfected with the Smad3-LUC constructs along with cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase (Invitrogen) as a control of transfection efficiency. One hour later, 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 or control vehicle was added, and the cells were harvested after 18–24 h. Luciferase assay results were normalized for β-galactosidase activity. Experimental points were performed in triplicates in several independent experiments. Plasmid Constructs—The -290/+157 Smad3-LUC construct containing Smad3 promoter sequences was generated as follows. The Smad3 promoter sequences from -1733/+157 or -1034/+157 obtained by PCR amplification using the Advantage GC genomic polymerase mix (Clontech laboratories) and human genomic DNA (Roche Applied Science) as a template were subcloned into the pGL3basic vector, which carries the luciferase reporter gene without a promoter (Promega). The resulting clones were used to generate the 5′ deletion mutant -290/+157 Smad3-LUC by digestion with SmaI and religation with the T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen). Two clones were verified by sequencing. Statistical Analysis—Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined by analysis of variance using the StatView, version 4.02, software program for Macintosh. Values of p < 0.05 by Fisher's protected least significant difference were considered significant. Differences between two comparative groups were further analyzed by unpaired Student's t test. Smad3 Protein Down-regulation—In studying activation of the Smad pathway in human glomerular mesangial cells, we observed that Smad3 protein levels were decreased in response to TGF-β1 (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, we also have shown that Smad3 is required for TGF-β1-stimulated COL1A2 gene expression, as overexpression of a Smad3 dominant-negative mutant or mutation of the Smad binding site in the COL1A2 promoter blocks its induction by TGF-β1 (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Poncelet A-C. Schnaper H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6983-6992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Here we sought to study the mechanism by which TGF-β1 regulates Smad expression. Smad3 (but not Smad2 or Smad4) was significantly decreased by 24 h of TGF-β1 treatment in mesangial cells (Fig. 1A). In these cells, Smad3 levels remained low for up to 72 h of incubation with TGF-β1 (data not shown). It should be noted that Smad2 protein expression was increased after 6 h of treatment with TGF-β1 but returned to control levels at 24 h (Fig. 1A). We next examined whether TGF-β1-induced Smad3 down-regulation is dependent on an active TGF-β receptor complex. Fig. 1B shows that the TGF-β type I receptor (Alk5/TβRI) kinase inhibitor SB-431542 blocked TGF-β1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and down-regulation, suggesting that decreased Smad3 expression requires an active Alk5/TβRI. Role of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway—Because polyubiquitination is generally considered to be a marker of protein degradation by the proteasome pathway (27Ciechanover A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), we examined the extent of Smad3 ubiquitination in response to TGF-β1. Fig. 2 shows that endogenous Smad3 was polyubiquitinated after 24 h of TGF-β1 stimulation in mesangial cells. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors prevented the decrease in Smad3 protein levels (Fig. 3) and led to accumulation of polyubiquitinated Smad3 (data not shown). These data suggest that the TGF-β1-induced Smad3 down-regulation occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.FIGURE 3Proteasome inhibitors prevent TGF-β1-mediated Smad3 down-regulation. Mesangial cells were pretreated for 1 h with 10 μm proteasome inhibitor I or Me2SO as vehicle control before the addition of TGF-β1 for 24 h. Lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Smad1/2/3 or anti-Smad4. Top, representative blots. Bottom, densitometric analysis of at least four independent experiments in which the proteasome pathway was inhibited with proteasome inhibitor I, lactacystin, or MG132. *, p = 0.0005; NS, not significant compared with levels in control cells for each Smad examined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Smad3 Gene Expression—Previously, we showed that, in addition to affecting Smad3 protein expression, TGF-β1 modulates Smad3 mRNA levels in mesangial cells, with Smad3 mRNA expression significantly decreased following 4 h of incubation with TGF-β1, whereas Smad2 and Smad4 mRNA levels remained unchanged (15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect of TGF-β1 on Smad3 down-regulation was direct or not, we examined whether cycloheximide affected Smad3 mRNA expression. Fig. 4A shows that cycloheximide alone increased Smad3 mRNA levels. However, it impaired TGF-β1-induced inhibition, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis may be required for Smad3 mRNA down-regulation in response to TGF-β1. Next, we investigated whether TGF-β1 affects Smad3 mRNA stability. An analysis of mRNA half-life using actinomycin D to inhibit transcription (Fig. 4B) showed that TGF-β1 did not increase the rate of turnover for Smad3 mRNA, suggesting that the TGF-β1-induced decline in Smad3 mRNA level is not due to decreased mRNA stability. Regulation of Smad3 Promoter Activity—Our results in Fig. 4B suggest that TGF-β1 inhibits mesangial cell Smad3 expression by a transcriptional mechanism. To evaluate this, we generated a Smad3 promoter luciferase reporter construct and assessed the effect of TGF-β1 on Smad3 promoter activity in transient transfection experiments. The Smad3-LUC construct showed increased activity of 137-fold over the empty vector (Fig. 5). Moreover, TGF-β1 treatment significantly inhibited Smad3 promoter activity, whereas it had no effect on the control empty reporter construct pGL3basic. These data suggest that, in addition to decreasing Smad3 protein stability via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (Fig. 2), TGF-β1 also inhibits Smad3 gene transcription. Smad3 Down-regulation in Cells with a Myofibroblastic Phenotype—Next, we sought to compare the effect of TGF-β1 on Smad3 expression in various cell types to determine whether the TGF-β1-induced Smad3 down-regulation is a general cell response. In contrast to what we observed in mesangial cells, treatment with TGF-β1 for 24 h did not affect the expression of any of the three Smad proteins examined in renal tubular epithelial HKC cells, although the Smad pathway was activated by TGF-β1 as determined by increased Smad3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6A). Similarly, we did not observe any Smad3 decline within this time frame in other epithelial cells, including the mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line NMuMG and mink lung epithelial cell line Mv1Lu (data not shown). Increasing evidence suggests that renal myofibroblasts, whose activation is thought to play a critical role in the progression of renal fibrosis by contributing to ECM overproduction, may derive at least in part from tubular epithelial cells via EMT (1Liu Y. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 213-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 28Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar, 29Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Because TGF-β has been shown to induce renal tubular cell EMT (30Fan J.M. Ng Y.Y. Hill P.A. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Mu W. Atkins R.C. Lan H.Y. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1455-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), we examined whether prolonged TGF-β1 treatment affects Smad3 expression following myofibroblastic phenotypic changes in HKC. Time course experiments showed a significant decrease in Smad3 levels after 7 days of exposure to TGF-β1 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, Smad2 and Smad4 levels remained unchanged. The timing of the decline in Smad3 expression coincided with a change to a myofibroblastic phenotype, as demonstrated by increased expression of smooth muscle α-actin (α-SMA), a myofibroblast marker, and decreased expression of E-cadherin, an epithelial cell marker (Fig. 6B), and enhanced collagen I accumulation (data not shown). Next, we examined whether Smad3 down-regulation occurs in HKC via a mechanism similar to what we observed in human mesangial cells. Fig. 7A shows that Smad3 was polyubiquitinated in HKC after 3–7 days of TGF-β1 treatment, suggesting that Smad3 protein is targeted for degradation by the proteasome pathway in these cells, although in delayed fashion, consistent with the occurrence of EMT. In addition, incubation with TGF-β1 led to a progressive decrease in Smad3 mRNA expression (Fig. 7B). These results suggest that, similar to what we demonstrated in human mesangial cells, Smad3 down-regulation in HKC following long term treatment with TGF-β1 involves both increased protein degradation and inhibition of transcription. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) is a model of tubulointerstitial fibrosis associated with TGF-β up-regulation that causes EMT of renal tubules and ECM accumulation (23Yang J. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 96-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1465-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 32Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined Smad3 expression after UUO. Smad3 levels were progressively decreased in the affected kidney following UUO in mice (Fig. 8). The decline was concomitant with increased α-SMA expression after 3 days, up to 14 days of obstruction. These changes correlate with increased TGF-β and TβRI expression in renal tubular epithelium of the obstructed kidney (31Yang J. Liu Y. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1465-1475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) as well as increased TGF-β1 mRNA (data not shown). Together, our findings suggest that Smad3 down-regulation is a cell type-specific event, occurring in response to TGF-β1 in cells with a fibroblastoid phenotype but not in epithelial cells. Because Smad3 plays a critical role in wound healing and the pathogenesis of fibrosis, determining how Smad3 is regulated is essential to understanding the mechanisms of these processes. Here we show that TGF-β1 down-regulates Smad3 levels in a cell phenotype-specific manner. This down-regulation is due to both increased degradation via the proteasome pathway and decreased gene transcription. Only a few studies have examined Smad3 turnover (18Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 19Inoue Y. Kitagawa M. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20842-20850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Potential E3 ubiquitin ligases reported to target Smad3 for degradation are the RING finger ubiquitin ligase ROC1 and the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein CHIP. The role of ROC1 is still controversial. Fukuchi et al. (18Fukuchi M. Imamura T. Chiba T. Ebisawa T. Kawabata M. Tanaka K. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1431-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) have suggested that overexpressed ROC1 interacts with activated Smad3 and triggers its degradation in COS7 cells, whereas Inoue et al. (19Inoue Y. Kitagawa M. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2004; 24: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were unable to detect interaction between Smad3 and ROC1 in HEK293T cells even after TGF-β stimulation. Overexpression of CHIP in several cell lines decreases basal Smad3 levels but independently of TGF-β signaling (20Xin H. Xu X. Li L. Ning H. Rong Y. Shang Y. Wang Y. Fu X.Y. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20842-20850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, in these studies, overexpressed Smad3 and ubiquitin were used and required overexpression of the E3 ligase complex ROC1-SCFFbw1a or CHIP and/or the presence of proteasome inhibitor to detect Smad3 ubiquitination. In contrast, we show a decline in endogenous Smad3 in mesangial cells within 24 h in response to TGF-β1 and that TGF-β1 treatment increases ubiquitination of endogenous Smad3 targeting it for degradation by the proteasome machinery. Whether ROC1, CHIP, or other E3 ligases play a role in endogenous Smad3 down-regulation remains to be examined. Interestingly, protein and mRNA expression of the closely related Smad2 are not affected by 24 h of treatment with TGF-β1 in human mesangial cells (present report and Ref. 15Poncelet A-C. de Caestecker M.P. Schnaper H.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1354-1365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Because Smad2 and Smad3 have distinct roles that may also be cell type-specific (33Piek E. Ju W.J. Heyer J. Escalante-Alcalde D. Stewart C.L. Weinstein M. Deng C. Kucherlapati R. Bottinger E.P.

TGF-β induces ECM accumulation in fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells such as glomerular mesangial cells, whereas it inhibits proliferation and/or induces apoptosis and EMT in several epithelial cells, including renal tubular epithelial cells (2Border W.A.

The interactions of the Smad cascade with other signaling pathways contribute to the specificity of the response (36Javelaud D. Mauviel A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 5742-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 37Moustakas A. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3573-3584Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Here we have identified a cell response that is both phenotype- and Smad type-specific. This specific Smad3 down-regulation may play a role in modulating TGF-β signals. In addition to decreasing Smad3 protein levels, our data show that TGF-β1 also modulates Smad3 mRNA expression. Although Smad3 mRNA down-regulation has been observed in two immortalized human lung epithelial cell lines, BEASB2B and HPL1A (38Yanagisawa K. Osada H. Masuda A. Kondo M. Saito T. Yatabe Y. Takagi K. Takahashi T. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and in normal skin and lung fibroblasts (39Mori Y. Chen S.J. Varga J. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 258: 374-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 40Zhao Y. Geverd D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the mechanism by which this occurs has not been described. Here we show that the TGF-β1-induced decrease in Smad3 mRNA expression is not due to an alteration in mRNA stability but rather to decreased promoter activity. In addition, our experiment with cycloheximide suggests that Smad3 down-regulation by TGF-β1 requires de novo synthesis of proteins, such as transcription factors and/or cytokines, that might act as autocrine or paracrine mediators. Of note, cycloheximide alone increases expression of Smad3 mRNA. This may result from increased stability of mRNA because of the inhibition of the synthesis of proteins involved in RNA degradation or relief of transcriptional repression. Although TGF-β-enhanced, ubiquitin-mediated Smad3 degradation has been reported previously, the data suggest that Smad3 expression is compensated by concomitant increased Smad3 synthesis in the time frame examined (18Fukuchi M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20842-20850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the result of this response appears to be that turnover is increased, but protein levels are stable. Our data suggest that a critical additional event in mesenchymal cells, inhibition of promoter activity, plays an important role in decreasing Smad3 expression. This is the first report showing regulation of an R-Smad promoter activity by TGF-β1. Because the decline in Smad3 is phenotype-specific, we hypothesize that inhibition of Smad3 gene expression could be part of a feedback loop controlling TGF-β signaling. Increased expression of the inhibitor Smad7 has been associated with inhibition of TGF-β signaling (41Nakao A. Afrakthe M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N-E. Heldin C.-H. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Smad7 may regulate TGF-β signaling by inhibiting R-Smad activation by TβRI (41Nakao A.

PIASy (protein inhibitor of activated STAT) and TLP (TRAP-1-like protein) may also negatively regulate TGF-β/Smad3-mediated signaling (45Imoto S. Sugiyama K. Muromoto R. Sato N. Yamamoto T.

Roberts A.B. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4465-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here, we suggest an additional mechanism for controlling TGF-β responses that involves a decrease in Smad3 expression by inhibition of gene transcription as well as increased protein degradation. Our data show that, although tubular epithelial cell Smad3 levels are unaffected by 24 h of treatment with TGF-β1, prolonged exposure to TGF-β1 leads to a significant decline in Smad3 expression. These changes parallel decreased E-cadherin and increased α-SMA expression, suggesting that decreased Smad3 expression occurs with EMT. Similar results were obtained in kidney following UUO, which is associated with EMT of the tubules. Because Smad3 has been shown to be essential for the initiation of EMT after UUO and in cultured tubular epithelial cells (32Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), the decline in Smad3 levels following EMT suggest that Smad3 down-regulation could represent a feedback loop controlling TGF-β1 responses. Interestingly, in a model of lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin, Smad3 expression decreased during the reparative phase of lung injury at days 8 and 12 (40Zhao Y. Geverd D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 319-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, Kelley et al. found reduced Smad3 protein levels in a model of cystic fibrosis compared with those in control mice (47Kelley T.J. Elmer H.L. Corey D.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that rat and mouse UUO kidneys show increased nuclear localization of phospho-Smad2/3 in some glomerular and tubulointerstitial cells (48Lan H.Y. Mu W. Tomita N. Huang X.R. Li J.H.

Yamashiro Y. Ogawa H. Nakao A. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Because we detected a decrease in total Smad3 expression in mouse UUO kidneys, this raises questions regarding whether the active or inactive form of Smad3 is targeted for degradation following UUO and whether and how the residual active Smad3 contributes to renal fibrosis. In summary, we have shown that TGF-β1 down-regulates Smad3 in cells with a myofibroblastic phenotype. The down-regulation involves protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and inhibition of gene transcription. Because Smad3 is a key mediator of fibrosis, understanding the causes and effects of changes in Smad3 expression may provide a model to suggest specific means to block fibrotic diseases.

FATP4 is highly expressed in enterocytes and has therefore been proposed to be a major importer of dietary fatty acids. Two independent mutations in Fatp4 cause mice to be born with thick, tight, shiny, “wrinkle-free” skin and a defective skin barrier; they die within hours of birth from dehydration and restricted movements. In contrast, induced keratinocyte-specific deficiency of FATP4 in adult mice causes only mild skin abnormalities. Therefore, whether the loss of FATP4 from skin or a systemic gestational metabolic defect causes the severe skin defects and neonatal lethality remain important unanswered questions. To investigate the basis for the phenotype, we first generated wild-type tetraploid/mutant diploid aggregates that should lead to rescue of any abnormalities caused by loss of FATP4 from the placenta. However, the skin phenotype was not ameliorated. We then generated transgenic mice expressing exogenous FATP4 either widely or specifically in suprabasal keratinocytes, and we bred the transgenes onto the Fatp4-/- background. Both modes of FATP4 expression led to rescue of the neonatally lethal skin defects, and the resulting mice were viable and fertile. Keratinocyte expression of an FATP4 variant with mutations in the acyl-CoA synthetase domain did not provide any degree of rescue. We conclude that expression of FATP4 with an intact acyl-CoA synthetase domain in suprabasal keratinocytes is necessary for normal skin development and that FATP4 functions in establishing the cornified envelope.

The most robust expression of FATP4 is in intestinal epithelial cells (5Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R.E. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Patel S. Kotler M. Raimondi A. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol.

Surprisingly, the “wrinkle-free” phenotype we discovered in mice with a spontaneous mutation in Slc27a4 (Slc27a4wrfr) and the identical phenotype of mice with a targeted Slc27a4 mutation (Slc27a4tm1.1Wsr) indicate critical roles for FATP4 in skin and hair development (6Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F.

For these mutations, which both affect exon 3, homozygotes are born with tight, thick, shiny skin and a defective skin barrier; they die shortly after birth because of restricted movements and dehydration. These defects are reminiscent of human restrictive dermopathy, but this disease has recently been linked to mutations in zinc metalloproteinase STE24 (8Moulson C.L. Go G.

Interestingly, deletion of Slc27a4 exons 2 and 3 (the first two coding exons; Slc27a4tm1Asta) results in embryonic lethality prior to embryonic day 9.5 (11Gimeno R.E. Hirsch D.J. Punreddy S. Sun Y.

The reason for the striking difference in phenotypes remains unknown, but it may involve a partially functional truncated protein in the first two mutants or early embryonic death unrelated to the interruption of the Slc27a4 gene in the third mutant. (For simplicity, the Slc27a4 gene will henceforth be referred to as Fatp4.) Several hypotheses can explain the etiology of the skin phenotype of Fatp4-/- mice. First, the skin defects could result from essential fatty acid deficiency because of loss of FATP4 from the placenta and insufficient maternal to fetal fatty acid transport (7Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, the lack of FATP4 expression in other fetal tissues, such as liver or adipose tissue, could cause systemic defects that lead to the skin phenotype. Third, FATP4 could be required in the skin; it could directly impact development of the epidermis via effects on fatty acids that serve as signaling molecules (7Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and/or it could be important for formation of the epidermal barrier by directly regulating the availability and nature of fatty acid derivatives that are incorporated into the lipid-rich barrier of the skin (6Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F. Grone H.J. Stewart A.F. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Liebisch G. Gosch I. Buchkremer F. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Stremmel W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Regarding an intrinsic role for FATP4 in skin, FATP4 has been conditionally deleted in the skin of adult mice. By gross appearance the mice appear normal, but several mild histological abnormalities are present in the epidermis (12Herrmann T. Grone H.J. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Gosch I. Bennemann U. Metzger D. Chambon P. Stewart A.F. Stremmel W. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2005; 125: 1228-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), supporting a direct role for FATP4 in the skin. However, the mildness of these defects compared with the severity of skin defects in Fatp4-/- animals suggests that expression in other tissues could also be relevant. We have now tested these hypotheses directly, using tetraploid aggregations to rescue potential placental abnormalities and transgenes to restore FATP4 expression either widely or specifically in keratinocytes. We found that FATP4 expressed in suprabasal keratinocytes, under the control of the involucrin promoter, is sufficient to rescue the lethality and most of the skin defects of Fatp4-/- mice. These results support the notion that the only absolute requirement for FATP4 expression is in the upper layers of the skin, consistent with a crucial role in the initial formation of the cornified envelope and the barrier of the skin during late fetal development. Tetraploid Aggregations—Tetraploid aggregations were performed as described (13Tanaka M. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 158: 135-154PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type ICR two-celled embryos were electrofused to form tetraploids and cultured for 24 h. Embryonic day (E) 2.5 embryos from Fatp4+/- females mated to Fatp4+/- males were then isolated, and each diploid embryo, 25% of which should be Fatp4-/-, was sandwiched between two wild-type tetraploid embryos. After 24 h, aggregates that had developed to single blastocysts were transferred to pseudopregnant recipient females. Fetuses and the attached placentas were dissected at E18.5 or E19.5 for analysis. Generation of Fatp4 Transgenic Mice—The Miw-Fatp4 transgene was produced by PCR amplification of the Fatp4 cDNA with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers that added HindIII sites to both ends of the cDNA. The PCR product was purified over a Wizard PCR clean up column (Promega, Madison, WI), cut with HindIII, and ligated directly into the HindIII site separating the promoter and polyadenylylation signal sequences of the Miw plasmid. Miw contains a Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat inserted into the chicken β-actin promoter (14Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K.

The transgene was liberated from the vector by digestion with NotI and purified from a gel using the Geneclean purification system (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH). The Ivl-Fatp4 transgene was produced by PCR amplification of Fatp4 cDNA with Pfu polymerase using primers that added NotI sites to both ends of the Fatp4 cDNA. The PCR product was purified, cut with NotI, and ligated into the NotI site of pH3700-pL2 containing the human involucrin promoter (16Carroll J.M. Albers K.M. Garlick J.A. Harrington R. Taichman L.B.

The Ivl-ΔFatp4 transgene was similarly produced from the Fatp4 cDNA with the S247G and T249G mutations introduced using primers containing the mutations and a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transgenic mice were created by microinjection of DNA into the pronuclei of 1-cell stage B6CBAF2 mouse embryos. Potential founder mice were screened for incorporation of the transgene by PCR using primers from two different exons of Fatp4. Founders were confirmed by Southern blotting. Immunohistochemistry—Anti-FATP4 antibody was generated as described (17Newberry E.P. Xie Y. Kennedy S. Han X. Buhman K.K. Luo J. Gross R.W. Davidson N.O. J. Biol.

Whole mouse embryos or individual tissues were frozen by immersion in optimal cutting temperature solution and quick-freezing in 2-methylbutane cooled in a dry ice/ethanol bath. Sections were cut at 7 μm on a cryostat, air-dried, and fixed in cold 100% ethanol for 10 min. For anti-FATP4 staining, ethanol-fixed sections were denatured for 1 h in cold 6 m urea, 0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, blocked in 1% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with the primary antibody. All antibody incubations were in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and all washes were performed in PBS. Secondary antibodies were conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or Cy3 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After several washes, sections were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1× PBS and 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine. Sections were examined through a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Images were captured with a Spot 2 cooled color digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) using Spot software version 3.5.9. Images were imported into Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator for processing and layout. RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting—Tissues from newborn mice were frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following resuspension of RNA in water and determination of concentration, mRNA was isolated using Poly(A)Purist™ MAG magnetic mRNA purification kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Poly(A) RNA (1 or 1.5 μg) Northern blotting was performed as described (7Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The GAPDH probe was a 700-bp reverse transcription-PCR product, and the FATP4 probe was an ∼1200-bp BstXI cDNA fragment. In Situ Hybridization and Riboprobes—In situ hybridization was performed as described (18Murtaugh L.C. Chyung J.H. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Hairs were removed using a beard clipper, and the dorsal skin was dissected. Samples were fixed at 4 °C overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5 μm. Sections were deparaffinized in XS-3 xylene substitute (StatLab Medical Product, Lewisville, TX), rehydrated in graded ethanols, fixed again in 4% paraformaldehyde, and digested in 5 μg/ml proteinase K in PBS for 10 min. All washes following rehydration were performed in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. Samples were post-fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, acetylated in 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8, with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min, and prehybridized in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1× Denhardt's, 200 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 0.25% SDS) without probe at room temperature for 1 h. Hybridization was performed with 0.3 ng/μl heat-denatured riboprobes at 60 °C overnight. Sections were washed in 5× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) at room temperature, 1× SSC and 50% formamide at 55 °C for 30 min, and TNE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at room temperature. Sections were digested in RNase A (20 μg/ml in TNE) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed in TNE at 37 °C, in 2× SSC at 55 °C for 20 min, and twice in 0.2× SSC at 55 °C for 20 min. Sections were washed in MABT (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5), blocked in blocking solution I (20% heat-inactivated normal sheep serum and 2% blocking reagent in MABT) (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature for 1 h, and incubated in 1:3000 anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in blocking solution II (5% heat-inactivated normal sheep serum and 2% blocking Reagent in MABT) at 4 °C overnight. Sections were washed in MABT, in NTMT (10 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, 100 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1% Tween 20), then in NTMT with 2 mm levamisol, and color-developed in BM Purple (Roche Applied Science) with 2 mm levamisol and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h to 3 days in the dark. Sections were finally washed in NTMT and in PBS, mounted in Crystal/Mount (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA), and postmounted in VectaMount (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Some sections were counterstained with Nuclear Fast Red (Sigma) before mounting. Adjacent sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin by standard methods. Riboprobes were synthesized from a linearized pcDNA3-based plasmid containing the full-length FATP4 coding region using digoxigenin RNA labeling mix (Roche Applied Science) and RNA Polymerase Plus (Ambion, Austin, TX). Riboprobes were purified by NucAway spin columns (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. To synthesize anti-sense and sense riboprobes, the plasmid was linearized by EcoRI or BstEII and transcribed with SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase, respectively. Hair Counts—Hairs were plucked in bunches from the back at various ages using forceps. Fur was pulled apart to individual hairs, spread on microscope slides, and mounted. Hair types were scored according to appearance as described (19Sundberg J. Hogan M. Sundberg J. Handbook of Mouse Mutations with Skin and Hair Abnormalities: Animal Models and Biochemical Tools.

Lipid Analysis of Epidermis—Newborn epidermis was separated from the dermis by overnight digestion at 4 °C in 5 mg/ml dispase in Hanks' buffered saline solution. Epidermal pieces were then rinsed several times in 50 mm lithium chloride and homogenized in water. Lipids were extracted with chloroform and methanol (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem.

Restoration of Fatp4 Expression in the Placenta—Fatp4 is highly expressed in both mouse and human placenta (7Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Larque E. Demmelmair H. Klingler M. De Jonge S. Bondy B. Koletzko B. Early Hum. Dev. 2006; 82: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The placenta is composed of extraembryonic cells that originate from the blastocyst; thus it is derived from and genotypically identical to the embryo (24Rossant J. Cross J.C. Rossant J. Tam P.P.L. Mouse Development: Patterning, Morphogenesis, and Organogenesis. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 155-180Crossref Google Scholar). In mouse placenta, expression of Fatp4 is most prominent in trophoblasts (Fig. 1G), the cells that transport all substances between mother and fetus. Because embryos obtain lipids from the maternal circulation only in the form of nonesterified fatty acids (25Haggarty P. Eur. J. Clin. Nutr. 2004; 58: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 26Herrera E. Placenta. 2002; 23: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that embryos might experience essential fatty acid deficiency in the absence of placental FATP4 (7Moulson C.L. Martin D.R. Lugus J.J. Schaffer J.E. Lind A.C. Miner J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency show many similarities to the Fatp4 mutant phenotype, including loss of barrier function, thickened epidermis, loss of skin elasticity, and loss of hair (27Elias P.M. Brown B.E. Lab. Investig. 1978; 39: 574-583PubMed Google Scholar, 28Foundation N. Nutr. Rev. 1969; 27: 85-88PubMed Google Scholar, 29Prottey C. Br. J. Dermatol. 1976; 94: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Vergroesen A.J. Bibl. Nutr. Dieta. 1976; 23: 19-26Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we performed tetraploid/diploid embryo aggregations. Tetraploid cells are severely limited in their ability to contribute to embryonic tissues (31Goto Y. Matsui J. Takagi N. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 741-745PubMed Google Scholar, 32James R.M. Klerkx A.H. Keighren M. Flockhart J.H. West J.D. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 213-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and therefore contribute primarily to the placenta, whereas diploid cells in aggregates contribute primarily to the embryo proper (31Goto Y. Matsui J. Takagi N. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 741-745PubMed Google Scholar, 33Hadjantonakis A.K. Macmaster S. Nagy A. BMC Biotechnol. 2002; 2: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Here, tetraploid embryos were derived from matings between wild-type mice, and these were aggregated with diploid embryos derived from matings between Fatp4+/- mice, of which ¼ are expected to be Fatp4-/- embryos. The aggregates were reimplanted into pseudopregnant foster mothers and allowed to develop to near term. With this strategy, Fatp4-/- embryos develop with wild-type placentas, and any abnormalities resulting from loss of FATP4 in trophoblasts should be rescued. From two litters of reimplanted aggregates, no fetuses with a normal phenotype had the Fatp4-/- genotype. However, we did identify two phenotypically wrinkle-free mice that were confirmed as Fatp4-/- mutants by genotyping. Compared with control, the mutant skin appeared histologically abnormal, with a thickened epidermis and a flat dermal-epidermal junction (Fig. 1, A and B); this appeared identical to mutant skin from a conventional pregnancy (Fig. 1C). Absence of FATP4 in the skin was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1, D-F). As expected, the tetraploid-derived placentas stained positive for FATP4 (Fig. 1, G and H), whereas a mutant placenta from a conventional pregnancy did not (Fig. 1I). These results indicate that even when nourished by a placenta containing wild-type trophoblasts expressing FATP4, Fatp4-/- fetuses exhibit the wrinkle-free phenotype; therefore, this phenotype does not result from loss of FATP4 in the placenta. Widespread Restoration of FATP4 Expression—With the original goal of proving that the wrinkle-free phenotype was caused by the absence of FATP4, we generated mice with a ubiquitously expressed FATP4 transgene for breeding onto the Fatp4-/- background. Transgene expression was driven by the Miw promoter, which is a hybrid chicken β-actin promoter/ Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat enhancer designed for widespread expression throughout mouse development (14Miyazaki J. Takaki S. Araki K. Tashiro F. Tominaga A. Takatsu K. Yamamura K. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 79: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). We identified one line of Miw-Fatp4 transgenic mice that expressed well (see below), and only that one was studied in depth. Mice carrying this transgene were mated to Fatp4+/- mice to obtain Fatp4+/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ mice. Fatp4+/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ mice were then mated to Fatp4+/- mice to obtain Fatp4-/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ offspring. No gross abnormalities were observed in Fatp4-/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ mice (Fig. 2D); they were viable and fertile and lived for well over a year. To confirm FATP4 expression from the Miw-Fatp4 transgene, mRNA was prepared from various tissues of newborn Fatp4+/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ mice, Northern-blotted, and probed for Fatp4 (Fig. 2A). Because the transgene contains an FATP4 cDNA that lacks part of the 3′-untranslated region, the transgene-derived mRNA appears at a smaller size on a Northern blot and is easily distinguished from the endogenous transcript (Fig. 2A). The Northern blot showed high level and widespread expression of transgene-derived FATP4 mRNA. To confirm protein expression from the transgene, E18.5 Fatp4-/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ fetuses were stained for FATP4 by immunofluorescence. FATP4 protein was detected in many tissues, with particularly high expression in the heart (data not shown). Immunofluorescence of skin indicated that compared with control skin, in which FATP4 was concentrated in the granular layer of the epidermis (Fig. 2B), transgene-derived protein was only barely detectable and rather diffuse in Fatp4-/-;Miw-Fatp4tg/+ skin (Fig. 2C). Because transgene-derived FATP4 mRNA was readily detectable in whole skin by Northern blotting (Fig. 2A), the transgene is likely expressed in all cells of the skin but not robustly by any specific cell type, resulting in the different staining pattern compared with control skin. Histological analysis of Miw-Fatp4-rescued mutant skin by hematoxylin and eosin staining at 5 months of age indicated that the epidermis was, for the most part, no different from the control (Fig. 2, E and F). We did observe some segmental, slight thickening of the epidermis at 5 months of age, and this was more frequently observed at 9 months (data not shown). However, we have never observed any gross abnormalities in the skin or hair of these mice, even at 16 months of age. From these studies we conclude the following: 1) the absence of FATP4 causes the wrinkle-free phenotype; and 2) the Miw-Fatp4 transgene is expressed in a spatial and temporal fashion that is sufficient to replace endogenous FATP4 wherever it is necessary for normal skin development. Keratinocyte-specific Restoration of Fatp4 Expression—We next sought to determine whether the Fatp4-/- skin phenotype results from loss of FATP4 specifically in the epidermis, where it is normally concentrated in the upper spinous and the granular layers (Fig. 2B) (6Herrmann T. van der Hoeven F. Grone H.J. Stewart A.F. Langbein L. Kaiser I. Liebisch G. Gosch I. Buchkremer F. Drobnik W. Schmitz G. Stremmel W. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We therefore used the well characterized human involucrin (Ivl) promoter to drive expression of FATP4 in transgenic mice. Involucrin is a scaffold protein of the cornified envelope (34Steinert P.M.

Dermatol. 2000; 9: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Two independent lines of transgenic mice carrying the Ivl-Fatp4 transgene were mated to Fatp4+/- mice for two generations to obtain Fatp4-/-;Ivl-Fatp4tg/+ mice. Most Fatp4-/-;Ivl-Fatp4tg/+ mice were indistinguishable from control mice at birth. Northern analysis of mRNA from several tissues from Fatp4+/-;Ivl-Fatp4tg/+ newborn mice confirmed that the transgene was expressed specifically in the skin, in contrast to the widespread expression of endogenous FATP4 (Fig. 3A) and Miw-Fatp4 (Fig. 2A). (Endogenous FATP4 expression appears higher in the Ivl-Fatp4 mice (Fig. 3A) than in the Miw-Fatp4 mice (Fig. 2A) because of different exposure times.) We next assayed the expression of transgene-derived FATP4 protein in E18.5 Fatp4-/-;Ivl-Fatptg/+ skin by immunohistochemistry. The results varied somewhat between the two lines. FATP4 was localized to the granular layer of the epidermis in both; however, in line 1 the expression pattern was patchy and not continuous as it was in control (Fig. 3, B and C), and in line 2 the expression was continuous (Fig. 3D). By in situ hybridization endogenous FATP4 RNA could not be detected in the control, nontransgenic epidermis (Fig. 4E), but in transgenic skin the RNA was easily detected in the granular layer and in the inner root sheath of hair follicles (Fig. 4, F and G).

Mouse Brorin consists of 324 amino acids with a putative secreted signal sequence at its amino terminus and two cysteine-rich domains in its core region.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). BMPs regulate embryonic development in most tissues and organs. It has become apparent that the fine-tuning of BMP signaling is critical for a variety of their functions, for example, in neural induction, limb morphogenesis, and skeletal development (2Von Bubnoff A. Cho K.W. Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 3Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of BMPs are regulated by secreted regulators. An increasing number of secreted BMP regulators have been described. In vertebrates, such proteins include Noggin, the Chordin family, Follistatin, FSRP, and the DAN/Cerberus family (3Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BMPs are also expressed in developing neural tissues (4Lein P. Drahushak K.M. Higgins D. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins: from Laboratory to Clinical Practice. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2002: 289-319Crossref Google Scholar). BMPs alter the fate of neural precursor cells from neurogenesis to astrocytogenesis (5Nakashima K. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Yanagisawa M. Hisatsune T. Nakafuku M. Miyazono K. Kishimoto T. Kageyama R. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Yanagisawa M.

Brain Res. 2003; 994: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) led us to the notion that BMPs may be involved in adult neurogenesis. Many secreted signaling proteins, including BMPs, FGFs, Wnts, and their regulators, play crucial roles in cell proliferation and differentiation. The identification and characterization of novel secreted signaling proteins are expected to provide new insights into the mechanism of cell proliferation and differentiation. We identified many genes encoding novel secreted proteins from mouse cDNAs of unknown function in the DNA databases. We termed one of them Brorin. Brorin has two cysteine-rich domains. The positions of cysteine in the domains are similar to those of members of the Chordin family that are secreted BMP regulators (11Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. De Robertis E.M. Gene. 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of a novel secreted BMP antagonist, Brorin, which was predominantly expressed in the neural tissues in mouse adults and embryos and promoted neurogenesis in mouse neural precursor cells. Although its physiological role remains to be elucidated, Brorin is expected to play roles in neural development and functions. Identification of Mouse and Human Brorin—Amino acid sequences predicted from mouse cDNAs of unknown function in nucleotide sequence databases were randomly analyzed using PSORT (Prediction of Protein Sorting Signals and Localization Sites in Amino Acid Sequences) (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/form2.html). Many cDNAs encoding putative secreted proteins were identified. We isolated full-length cDNAs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the embryonic cDNA (embryonic day 14.5, E14.5) as a template and cloned them in a vector DNA, pBluescript II SK (+) (Stratagene). We termed one of the cDNAs mouse Brorin. Human Brorin cDNA was also identified in a homology-based search of human cDNA sequences in nucleotide sequence databases with the amino acid sequence of mouse Brorin. Forced Expression of Mouse Brorin cDNA in COS-7 Cells—The mouse Brorin cDNA with a DNA fragment encoding a Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) and a His6 tag (HHHHHH) at the 3′ terminus of the coding region was constructed between EcoRI and XbaI sites in a vector DNA, pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). COS-7 cells were plated at ∼70-80% confluency (∼2 × 104 cells/cm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (JRH Biosciences) on 12-well plates and were transfected with the recombinant vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 16 h in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. After the transfection, COS-7 cells were further cultured in fresh culture medium at 37 °C for 72 h. Detection of Recombinant Mouse Brorin Protein by Western Blotting—The culture medium and lysate of the transfected cells were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5%) electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL; Amersham Biosciences). The protein with the Myc tag on the membrane was detected using mouse monoclonal anti-Myc tag antibody (Cell Signaling) (1:500) as primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (ZYMED) (1:1,000) as secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (12Yamashita T. Konishi M. Miyake A. Inui K. Itoh N. J. Biol.

Prestained Protein Marker Broad Range (New England Biolabs) was used as molecular mass standard proteins. Production of Recombinant Mouse Brorin in Insect Cells—The coding region (without the amino-terminal secreted signal sequence of 27 amino acids) of mouse Brorin cDNA with a DNA fragment encoding a Myc tag and a His6 tag at the 3′ terminus of the coding region was constructed in a transfer vector DNA, pAcGP67A. Recombinant baculovirus containing the cDNA was obtained by cotransfection of Sf9 cells with the recombinant pAcGP67A and a Bsu36I-digested expression vector, BacPak6. High Five cells (∼2 × 106 cells/ml) infected with the recombinant baculovirus were cultured at 27 °C for 72 h in serum-free medium EX-CELL 400 (JRH Bioscience). Recombinant mouse Brorin was purified from the culture medium by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose and desalted by gel filtration chromatography using Bio-Gel P-6 DG in PBS containing 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin as a carrier. Purified recombinant mouse Brorin was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12.5%) electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purified recombinant mouse Brorin was also analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was extracted from mouse tissue using an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Mouse cDNA was transcribed from the RNA as a template with Molony murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. Brorin cDNA was amplified from the cDNA with Taq DNA polymerase and primers specific for mouse Brorin (5′-acgtggtaggggatgcctagctc-3′, 5′-gtctacatttgtctgcactcatg-3′). Gapdh cDNA was amplified with primers specific for mouse Gapdh (5′-tgaccacagtccatgccatc-3′,5′-tccaccaccctgttgctgta-3′) as a control. The amplified DNA was analyzed by agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis. Thereafter, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The expected sizes of Brorin cDNA and Gapdh cDNA are 988 and 454 base pairs, respectively. In Situ Hybridization—For in situ hybridization, embryos and mouse brain (postnatal day 56, P56) were frozen in powdered dry ice, and sections were cut at 16 μm with a cryostat, thaw-mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides, and stored at -85 °C prior to use. A 35S-labeled mouse sense or antisense Brorin RNA probe was transcribed from SpeI or HindIII-digested mouse brorin cDNA cloned in pBlueScript II SK (+) (Stratagene) using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase with uridine 5′-[α-35S]thiotriphosphate (∼30 TBq/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), respectively. The sections were examined by in situ hybridization with the labeled probe, followed by exposure to x-ray film (BioMax MR; Kodak) for 10 days or dipping in liquid emulsion (Kodak NTB3) diluted 1:1 and exposure for 3 weeks as described (13Yazaki N.

The sections of mouse embryos and brain were counterstained with hematoxylin-eosin and cresyl-violet (Nissl staining), respectively. Silver grains were visualized by microscopy. Alkaline Phosphatase Activity in MC3T3-E1 Cells—Mouse preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were maintained and subcultured at 37 °C for 3 or 4 days in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air in α-modified minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in a humidified CO2 incubator. For the determination of alkaline phosphatase activity, MC3T3-E1 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 48-well plates for 48 h. Once confluent, the cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid for 72 h. The cells were then cultured in α-MEM containing 0.3% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin for 24 h and further cultured in α-MEM containing 0.3% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, recombinant human BMP2 or BMP6 (0 or 10 ng/ml) (R&D Systems), recombinant mouse Noggin (0 or 100 ng/ml) (R&D systems), and recombinant mouse Brorin protein (0-100 ng/ml) for 72 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped in 10 mm Tris-HCl containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.05% Triton X-100, pH 8.2. The cell suspensions were sonicated on ice. Aliquots of supernatants were assayed for protein concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity as described (14Takeuchi Y. Suzuwa M. Kikuchi T. Nishida E. Fujita T. Matsumoto T. J. Biol.

For the alkaline phosphatase activity, the assay mixture contained 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.1 m sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10, supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2, and was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After 0.1 m NaOH was added, the amount of p-nitrophenol liberated was measured by using a spectrophotometer. Phosphorylation of Smad Protein in MC3T3-E1 Cells—MC3T3-E1 cells were plated in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates for 48 h. Once confluent, the cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 0.3% FBS, 100 units/ml of penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin for 48 h.

The cells were lysed in TNE buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml of aprotinin, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml of pepstatin. Phosphorylated Smad proteins in the cell lysate were detected by Western blotting using rabbit antibody against phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 (1:1,000) (Cell Signaling) as primary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody against anti-rabbit antibody (1:2,000) (VECTOR) as secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20.

Res. 2006; 83: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, mouse embryonic diencephalon at E13.5 was mechanically dissociated into single cells in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution. The dissociated cells were seeded in N2-supplemented 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F12 containing 100 units/ml of penicillin G and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin on 35-mm dishes coated with poly-l-ornithine (15 μg/ml) (Sigma) and fibronectin (1 μg/ml) (Sigma) for differentiation and cell proliferation activity assays, respectively. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Neural Differentiation Activity Assay—Mouse neural precursor cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 in 35-mm dishes coated with poly-l-ornithine and fibronectin. After being cultured in N2-supplemented 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: Ham's F12 for 2 h, the cells were further cultured under the various conditions indicated. For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and washed in PBS at room temperature for 30 min three times. They were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 30 min and immunostained using primary antibodies in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 and secondary antibodies in PBS. The cells were treated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After three washes for 5 min in PBS, the cells were further treated with the secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies used were as follows: an anti-micro-tubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) mouse monoclonal antibody (1:400) (Sigma) and an anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:100) (Sigma). Secondary antibodies used were rhodamine red- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibodies (Sigma) (1:200). Cell nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Roche Applied Science). The stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Results are the means ± S.E. for six different fields (at least 200 cells/field) from four independent slides. Identification of Mouse and Human Brorin—We identified mouse cDNAs encoding novel putative secreted proteins by randomly analyzing amino acid sequences predicted from mouse cDNAs of unknown function in the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data base with a computer program for the prediction of protein localization sites in cells (PSORT). The full-length cDNAs were isolated by PCR with mouse embryonic cDNA as a template. One of them encodes a putative secreted protein of 324 amino acids with a putative signal sequence (27 amino acids) at its amino terminus (GenBank™ accession code AB292670) (Fig. 1A). The protein has two cysteine-rich domains in its core region (Fig. 1, A and B). Positions of 10 cysteine residues in the domains of Brorin are similar to those in the cysteine-rich domains of members of the Chordin family, although the amino acid sequence of Brorin is not significantly similar to that of any other member of the family. The cysteine-rich domains are most similar to those of Crossveinless-2 among members of the Chordin family (16Coffinier C. Ketpura N. Tran U. Geissert D. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The gene was predominantly expressed in the brain as described below. Therefore, we termed it Brorin, short for brain-specific chordin-like protein. Human Brorin cDNA (accession number AB292671) was also identified in a homology-based search of human cDNA sequences in GenBank™ with the amino acid sequence of mouse Brorin. The amino acid sequence of human Brorin (325 amino acids) was highly similar (∼90% identity) to that of mouse Brorin (Fig. 1A). We examined the chromosomal localization of the human Brorin gene by searching the Ensembl data base with the nucleotide sequence of human Brorin cDNA. The gene was mapped to chromosome 7 at q12.2. Forced Expression of Mouse Brorin cDNA in Cultured Cells, COS-7 Cells—To examine whether Brorin is a secreted protein, mouse cDNA encoding Brorin with Myc and His6 tags was expressed in cultured cells, COS-7 cells. Both the culture medium and cell lysate were examined by reducing SDS-poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting with anti-Myc tag antibody. No bands were detected in the cell lysate or culture medium of COS-7 cells transfected with the empty vector as a control (data not shown). A major band of ∼49 kDa was mainly detected in the culture medium of COS-7 cells transfected with the Brorin expression vector, indicating that Brorin is a secreted protein (Fig. 2A). The observed molecular mass was larger than the calculated molecular mass of the recombinant Brorin protein (∼38.1 kDa), indicating that Brorin protein might be subjected to post-translational modification. Production of Purified Recombinant Mouse Brorin Protein—To prepare purified recombinant mouse brorin protein, mouse Brorin cDNA was expressed in cultured High Five insect cells by infection with a recombinant baculovirus containing the mouse Brorin cDNA with the 3′-terminal extension encoding Myc and His6 tags. Recombinant mouse Brorin was purified from the culture medium of High Five cells by affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose. Purified recombinant mouse Brorin was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by protein staining. Purified recombinant Brorin showed a single band of 48 kDa with a band of bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) as a carrier (Fig. 2B). Purified recombinant mouse Brorin was also analyzed by Western blotting. Purified recombinant Brorin also showed a single band of 48 kDa (Fig. 2B). Expression of Brorin in Mouse Tissues and Embryos Examined by RT-PCR—The expression of Brorin in mouse tissues (P56) was examined by RT-PCR. Although the expression of Gapdh as a control was detected in all the tissues examined, the expression of Brorin was mostly detected in the brain among major tissues examined, indicating that Brorin was predominantly expressed in the brain (Fig. 3A). We also examined the expression of Brorin in the brain at different developmental stages (E12.5-P56) by RT-PCR. The expression was detected in the brain at all the stages examined. However, the expression gradually increased with development (Fig. 3B). Expression of Brorin in Mouse Embryos and Adult Brain Examined by in Situ Hybridization—The expression of Brorin in mouse embryos at E12.5, E16.5, and E18.5 was examined by in situ hybridization with a 35S-labeled antisense Brorin cRNA probe using sagittal sections. The expression in embryos was shown by red grains (Fig. 4A). In contrast, essentially no grains were detected in embryos with a 35S-labeled sense Brorin cRNA probe as a control (data not shown). The expression of Brorin was predominantly detected in the developing diencephalon at E12.5 and in the developing neural tissues and tongue at E16.5 and E18.5. However, essentially no Brorin expression was observed in the developing cerebral cortex at E16.5 and E18.5. The expression of Brorin in the brain at P56 was also examined by in situ hybridization with the antisense Brorin probe using consecutive coronal sections. The expression of Brorin, shown by red grains, was widely detected in the brain (Fig. 4B, a-i). However, prominent expression of Brorin was observed in the diencephalon and medulla oblongata. In contrast, essentially no grains were detected with the sense Brorin cRNA probe as a control (Fig. 4B, j-r). The cellular distribution of Brorin mRNA in the brain was examined using in situ hybridization followed by microautoradiography. With Nissl staining of brain sections, glial cells appeared as small intensely stained (dark) cells. In contrast, neurons were generally larger and less intensely stained (lighter) because of their volume (17Gerfen C.R. Methods Neurosci. 1989; 60: 101-114Google Scholar). In the diencephalon and medulla oblongata, Brorin mRNA was detected in neurons, but not in glial cells (Fig. 4C). In other regions of the brain, Brorin mRNA was also detected in neurons (data not shown). These results indicated that Brorin in the brain was expressed in neurons but not glial cells. Effects of Brorin on BMP Signaling in Cultured Osteoblasts, MC3T3-E1—Positions of 10 cysteine residues in the cysteine-rich domains of Brorin are similar to those in the cysteine-rich domains of members of the chordin family. Most members of this family are regulators of BMP signaling, indicating that Brorin might be also. BMPs were originally identified as proteins in bone that induce ectopic bone and cartilage to form in vivo. BMPs are signaling molecules for the stimulation of osteoblastic differentiation (18Hogan B.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Most are members of the dpp and 60A subgroups of the TGFβ superfamily (4Lein P. Drahushak K.M. Higgins D. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins: from Laboratory to Clinical Practice. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2002: 289-319Crossref Google Scholar). We examined the effect of recombinant mouse Brorin on the activity of BMP2 and BMP6, as representatives of the dpp and 60A subgroups, respectively, for the differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells by determining alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for osteoblastic differentiation (19Franceschi R.T. Iyer B.S. Cui Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1994; 9: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). We also examined the effect of recombinant mouse Noggin proteins as a control of a BMP antagonist. BMP2 and BMP6 greatly stimulated the alkaline phosphatase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5A). The activity stimulated by BMP2 and BMP6 was inhibited by Brorin in a dose-dependent manner as well as by Noggin (Fig. 5A), indicating that Brorin is a BMP antagonist. BMPs also induce the phosphorylation of Smad in MC3T3-E1 cells. To confirm the antagonistic activity of Brorin, we also examined effects of Brorin and Noggin as a control on the phosphorylation of Smad induced by BMPs in MC3T3-E1 cells. BMP2 and BMP6 induced the phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 5B). The phosphorylation induced by BMP2 and BMP6 was inhibited by Brorin as well as Noggin (Fig. 5B), also indicating that Brorin is a BMP antagonist. Effects of Brorin on Neuronal and Astrocytic Differentiation in Cultured Neural Precursor Cells—The temporal and regional expression profiles of Brorin indicated its potential roles in neural differentiation. As the prominent expression of Brorin was observed in mouse embryonic diencephalons, we examined the effect of recombinant mouse Brorin protein on the neural differentiation of mouse diencephalic neural precursor cells. As FBS promotes neural differentiation in neural precursor cells (20Brunet J.F. Grollimund L. Chatton J.Y. Lengacher S. Magistretti P.J. Villemure J.G. Pellerin L. Glia. 2004; 46: 8-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of FBS (10%) on the differentiation as a positive control. After the neural precursor cells had been cultured in the presence of FBS or Brorin protein for 3 days, the differentiation was examined by double immunostaining using anti-MAP2 and GFAP antibodies for neurons and astrocytes, respectively (Fig. 6A). Green and red signals indicate MAP2-positive and GFAP-positive cells, respectively. Blue signals indicate cell nuclei counterstained with DAPI. The effects of FBS and Brorin on the total number of cells and neural differentiation were quantified by counting DAPI-positive cell nuclei and MAP2-positive and GFAP-positive cells (Fig. 6, B-D). FBS significantly increased the total number of cells. FBS also significantly increased the proportion of MAP2-positive cells and generated GFAP-positive cells among the neural precursor cells. In addition, FBS greatly stimulated the out-growth of neurites in MAP2-positive cells. As Brorin slightly increased the total number of cells, it may promote the proliferation and/or survival of the neural precursor cells. In addition, Brorin increased the proportion of MAP2-positive cells among the neural precursor cells and significantly stimulated their neurite outgrowth. However, treatment with Brorin did not produce GFAP-positive cells. These results indicate that Brorin induced neurogenesis, but not astrogenesis. Brorin Is a Novel Secreted BMP Antagonist of the Chordin Family with a Unique Structure—BMPs play important roles in many organogenic processes, although they were originally identified as factors promoting the ectopic formation of cartilage and bone. The activity of BMP is controlled in part by secreted BMP regulators, including Noggin, members of the Chordin family, and members of the Dan/Cerberus family (3Balemans W. Van Hul W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 231-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Chordin family is a group of proteins with cysteine-rich domains that consist of 10 cysteine residues. The family comprises Chordin, Chordin-like (CHL)/Neuralin, CHL2 (11Garcia Abreu J. Coffinier C. Larrain J. Oelgeschlager M. De Robertis E.M. Gene. 2002; 287: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Neurogenesin-1 (21Ueki T. Tanaka M. Yamashita K. Mikawa S. Qiu Z. Maragakis N.J. Hevner R.F. Miura N. Sugimura H. Sato K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11732-11740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chandra A. Itakura T. Yang Z. Tamakoshi T. Xue X. Wang B. Ueki T. Sato K. Uezato T. Miura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), Crossveinless-2 (16Coffinier C. Ketpura N. Tran U. Geissert D. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 23Ikeya M. Kawada M. Kiyonari H. Sasai N. Nakao K. Furuta Y. Sasai Y. Development. 2006; 133: 4463-4473Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and Kielin/chordin-like protein (24Lin J. Patel S.R. Cheng X. Cho E.A. Levitan I. Ullenbruch M. Phan S.H. Park J.M. Dressler G.R. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These members have different numbers of cysteine-rich domains and no structural similarity to each other. CHL, CHL2, and Neurogenesin-1 have three cysteine-rich domains. Chordin, Crossveinless, and Kielin/chordin-like protein have four, eighteen, and five cysteine-rich domains, respectively. They are secreted regulators of BMP signaling. Chordin, CHL/Neuralin, CHL2, and Neurogenesin-1 are BMP antagonists. In contrast, Crossveinless-2 functions as a BMP antagonist and a pro-BMP factor. Kielin/chordin-like protein is a positive regulator of BMP signaling. Brorin, a novel secreted BMP antagonist, has only two cysteine-rich domains, although the other members of the Chordin family have three to eighteen cysteine-rich domains as described above. In addition, the amino acid sequence of Brorin has no structural similarity to other members of the family, although the positions of cysteine residues in the domains are similar to those of other members. These results indicate that Brorin is a unique member of the Chordin family. Brorin Is Preferentially Expressed in Adult and Embryonic Neural Tissues—Mouse Chordin is expressed at relatively high levels in mouse embryos at E7 and at much decreased levels later in development and in adult tissues (25Pappano W.N. Scott I.C. Clark T.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Greenspan D.S. Genomics. 1998; 52: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Mouse CHL/Neuralin is expressed in the neural plate (26Coffinier C. Tran U. Larrain J. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Later during development, Neuralin/CHL is expressed in neural tissue derivatives and in many mesenchymes, including the forming axial skeleton (26Coffinier C. Tran U. Larrain J. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2001; 100: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 27Nakayama N. Han C.E. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. He C. Zeni L. Yamane H. Chang D. Yu D. Yokota T. Wen D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 232: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mouse CHL2 expression is restricted to chondrocytes of various developing joint cartilage surfaces and connective tissues in reproductive organs (28Nakayama N. Han C.Y. Cam L. Lee J.I. Pretorius J. Fisher S. Rosen-feld R. Scully S. Nishinakamura R. Duryea D. Van G. Bolon B. Yokota T. Zhang K. Development. 2004; 131: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Neurogenesin-1 is expressed in the hippocampus and around the lateral ventricle in the adult brain and in the primordial cells of the skeleton (21Ueki T. Tanaka M. Yamashita K. Mikawa S. Qiu Z. Maragakis N.J. Hevner R.F. Miura N. Sugimura H. Sato K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11732-11740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chandra A. Itakura T. Yang Z. Tamakoshi T. Xue X. Wang B. Ueki T. Sato K. Uezato T. Miura N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 344: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Crossveineless-2 is expressed dynamically during mouse development, in particular in regions of strong BMP signaling such as the posterior primitive streak, ventral tail bud, and prevertebral cartilages (16Coffinier C. Ketpura N. Tran U. Geissert D. De Robertis E.M. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In mouse embryos, Kielin/chordin-like protein expression was prominent in two areas, the limb buds and the developing kidney, with diffuse staining in the central nervous system (24Lin J. Patel S.R. Cheng X. Cho E.A. Levitan I. Ullenbruch M. Phan S.H. Park J.M. Dressler G.R. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Brorin was expressed in restricted neural regions. At E12.5, Brorin was predominantly expressed in the diencephalon. Later in development (E16.5 and E18.5), Brorin was also predominantly expressed in the brain and spinal cord. However, no Brorin expression was observed in the cerebral cortex. In addition, Brorin was predominantly expressed in the brain among adult tissues examined. The expression of Brorin was wide-spread in neurons of the brain. This neural tissue-specific expression profile of Brorin is quite distinct from that of any other member of the Chordin family, indicating that Brorin might play unique roles in developing and adult neural tissues. Possible Roles of Brorin in the Developing and Adult Neural Tissues—The developing neural tissues express multiple BMPs, including BMPs 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. BMPs are also expressed in the postnatal and adult brain. Transcript levels for BMPs generally peak during the perinatal period and then decline in the adult neural tissues (4Lein P. Drahushak K.M. Higgins D. Bone Morphogenetic Proteins: from Laboratory to Clinical Practice. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2002: 289-319Crossref Google Scholar). However, strong signals are still detectable in discrete structures of the mature brain. For example, the adult hippocampus expresses relatively high levels of BMP5 and BMP6; the cortex: BMP5 and BMP6; the cerebellum: BMP5; the striatum: BMP5 and BMP7; and the brainstem: BMP5 and BMP6 (7Mehler M.F. Mabie P.C. Zhang D. Kessler J.A. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 309-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 29Tomizawa K. Matsui H. Kondo E. Miyamoto M. Tokuda M. Itano T.

Galter D. Jai J. Krieglstein K. Unsicker K. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8597-8603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, BMP 2, 4, 5, and 6 are expressed in the adult cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and substantia nigra (10Chen H.L. Lein P.J. Wang J.Y. Gash D. Hoffer B.J. Chiang Y.H. Brain Res. 2003; 994: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These expression profiles indicate that BMP signaling plays roles in developing and adult. BMP2, BMP4, and BMP7 inhibit neurogenesis and concomitantly induce astrogenesis in mouse neural precursor cells (5Nakashima K. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Yanagisawa M. Hisatsune T. Nakafuku M. Miyazono K. Kishimoto T. Kageyama R. Taga T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5868-5873Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 6Yanagisawa M. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Uemura A. Nakashima K. Taga T. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 41: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to BMPs, Brorin significantly promoted neurogenesis, but not astrogenesis, in mouse neural precursor cells. As Brorin is a BMP antagonist, the present finding is consistent with the findings that BMPs inhibit neurogenesis (5Nakashima K. Takizawa T. Ochiai W. Yanagisawa M. Hisatsune T. Nakafuku M.

Zebrafish brorin was also predominantly expressed in the neural tissues in embryos. We generated brorin knockdown zebrafish embryos. Our preliminary analysis of the phenotype shows that development of the brain was greatly impaired, indicating that brorin potentially plays a role in the embryonic development of the brain. 3N. Itoh, Y. Nakayama, and A. Miyake, unpublished observation. Although its physiological role remains to be elucidated, Brorin is expected to act as a BMP antagonist during neurogenesis in both the adult brain and developing neural tissues. The present findings should provide new insights into the roles of BMP signaling in neural tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1975691981,"Synapsins are synaptic vesicle-associated phosphoproteins implicated in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Synapsin I is the major binding protein for the SH3 domain of the kinase c-Src in synaptic vesicles. Its binding leads to stimulation of synaptic vesicle-associated c-Src activity. We investigated the mechanism and role of Src activation by synapsins on synaptic vesicles. We found that synapsin is tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Src in vitro and on intact synaptic vesicles independently of its phosphorylation state on serine. Mass spectrometry revealed a single major phosphorylation site at Tyr(301), which is highly conserved in all synapsin isoforms and orthologues. Synapsin tyrosine phosphorylation triggered its binding to the SH2 domains of Src or Fyn. However, synapsin selectively activated and was phosphorylated by Src, consistent with the specific enrichment of c-Src in synaptic vesicles over Fyn or n-Src. The activity of Src on synaptic vesicles was controlled by the amount of vesicle-associated synapsin, which is in turn dependent on synapsin serine phosphorylation. Synaptic vesicles depleted of synapsin in vitro or derived from synapsin null mice exhibited greatly reduced Src activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of other synaptic vesicle proteins. Disruption of the Src-synapsin interaction by internalization of either the Src SH3 or SH2 domains into synaptosomes decreased synapsin tyrosine phosphorylation and concomitantly increased neurotransmitter release in response to Ca(2+)-ionophores. We conclude that synapsin is an endogenous substrate and activator of synaptic vesicle-associated c-Src and that regulation of Src activity on synaptic vesicles participates in the regulation of neurotransmitter release by synapsin."
https://openalex.org/W2022201565,"The objective of the present investigation was to identify the substrate binding site(s) within the yeast mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP). Our strategy involved kinetically characterizing 30 single-Cys CTP mutants that we had previously constructed based on their hypothesized importance in the structure-based mechanism of this carrier. As part of these studies, a modified transport assay was developed that permitted, for the first time, the accurate determination of Km values that were elevated >100-fold compared with the Cys-less control value. We identified 10 single-Cys CTP mutants that displayed sharply elevated Km values (i.e. 5 to >300-fold). Each of these mutants displayed Vmax values that were reduced by ≥98% and resultant catalytic efficiencies that were reduced by ≥99.9%. Importantly, superposition of this functional data onto the three-dimensional homology-modeled CTP structure, which we previously had developed, revealed that nine of these ten residues form two topographically distinct clusters. Additional modeling showed that: (i) each cluster is capable of forming numerous hydrogen bonds with citrate and (ii) the two clusters are sufficiently distant from one another such that citrate is unlikely to interact with all of these residues at the same time. We deduced from these findings that the CTP contains at least two citrate binding sites per monomer, which are located at increasing depths within the translocation pathway. The identification of these sites, combined with an initial assessment of the citrate-amino acid side-chain interactions that may occur at these sites, substantially extends our understanding of CTP functioning at the molecular level.

In addition, the concerted action of citrate lyase and malate dehydrogenase enables the generation of NAD+, a cofactor that is essential for the glycolytic pathway.

Recently, employing a Cys-less yeast mitochondrial CTP construct that displays native functional properties (11Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); (ii) utilized cysteine-scanning mutagenesis combined with probing the accessibility of single-Cys mutants to MTS reagents, in both the absence and presence of citrate, to identify those residues in transmembrane domains III and IV that line the substrate translocation pathway (13Kaplan R.S.

Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar); and (iv) superimposed our functional data onto this homology model to delineate substantial portions of the translocation pathway within the structure (15Ma C.

J. 2004; 87: 907-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). With this background in mind, the current studies focused on characterizing the kinetic properties of a panel of single-Cys mutants that we had previously constructed based on their predicted importance in the CTP mechanism (11Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 14Ma C. Kotaria R.

Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We identified ten mutations that display both substantially elevated Km values and reduced Vmax values, nine of which localize to two topographically distinct clusters within the CTP structure. Modeling studies indicate that, although citrate is capable of numerous hydrogen bonding interactions with each cluster, one molecule of citrate cannot simultaneously interact with all members of both clusters. These findings have led us to propose a model, wherein the CTP contains at least two discrete substrate binding sites per monomer. The details of these sites and the implications of this model are discussed in detail. Construction, Overexpression, and Isolation of Single-Cys CTP Variants—Single-Cys CTP variants were prepared as previously described (14Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Eriks L.R. Dean A.M. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, single-Cys CTP genes were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutagenic primers were analyzed with Oligo 5.0 software. PCR amplifications and subsequent cloning steps were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Cys-less yeast mitochondrial CTP gene in pET-21a(+) was utilized as the starting template (11Xu Y. Kakhniashvili D.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7117-7124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Transformants were screened for the presence of inserts via restriction digestion of plasmid DNA with NdeI and BamHI. The DNA from positive clones was then partially sequenced to assure the presence of the desired mutation. Plasmids scoring positively for the mutation of interest were then subcloned into the storage (Nova-Blue) and expression (BL21(DE3)) hosts. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing both strands of the entire CTP open reading frame. BL21(DE3) growth and induction of expression with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). Two hours following the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, three 200-ml aliquots of each culture were removed and placed on ice for 5 min. Following cell harvesting and resuspension, the three aliquots from each culture were combined into one tube. Cells were then lysed, and the inclusion body fraction was purified essentially as previously detailed (8Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The CTP was extracted by resuspension of the final inclusion body pellet in 6 ml of ice-cold 1.2% (w/v) Sarkosyl, which was dissolved in buffer, followed by centrifugation at 314,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant contains the solubilized CTP. Protein was quantified via the method of Kaplan and Pedersen (19Kaplan R.S. Pedersen P.L. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Incorporation of Single-Cys CTP Variants into Liposomal Vesicles—Overexpressed, Sarkosyl-solubilized, single-Cys CTP mutants were incorporated into liposomal vesicles, in the presence of 48 mm citrate, via the freeze-thaw sonication procedure as previously described (8Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Gremse D.A. Wood D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4108-4114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 9Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immediately prior to the transport assay, a given sample was thawed, sonicated on ice, and the extraliposomal citrate was removed via chromatography on a Dowex column in a Pasteur pipette. The sample was immediately used to assay transport. It should be noted that, with single-Cys mutants K83C, R87C, G119C, E122C, R181C, R189C, and R276C, whose Km values are much higher than those of many of the other mutants studied, the concentration of citrate included in the reconstitution incubation was increased to 75 mm. Following freeze-thaw sonication, the resulting higher level of extraliposomal citrate necessitated utilization of a larger capacity Dowex column for its removal. Thus, with these incubations, external citrate was removed on an Amersham Biosciences column containing 3 ml of Dowex beads. Determination of the Kinetic Parameters of CTP Variants before and after Modification with MTS Reagents—The kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of the Cys-less and the single-Cys CTP variants before modification with MTS reagents were determined as follows (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Remani S. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2331-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes (45 μl) were preincubated with 3.5 μl of either buffer (experimental sample) (9Kaplan R.S. Mayor J.A. Johnston N. Oliveira D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13379-13385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or 200 mm 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (control sample) for 10-12 min and were then further incubated with 3.5 μl of deionized/distilled water for an additional 10-12 min. The transport reaction was triggered via the addition of 21.5 μl of varying concentrations of [1,5-14C]citrate (Amersham Biosciences). Typically, ∼10 different external citrate concentrations bracketing the Km value were employed. However, with several CTP variants that displayed extremely high Km values (i.e. K83C, R87C, R189C, and R276C) substrate concentrations that were greater than the Km value could not be utilized because 50 mm external citrate was the highest concentration that we could employ and still maintain a specific radioactivity that was sufficiently high to enable accurate measurement of transport activity. Also, with very high Km mutants, the [14C]citrate source was concentrated by evaporation under vacuum prior to making up the stock solutions. Following transport incubations that ranged from 12 s to 2.5 h (depending on the intrinsic activity of a given CTP mutant), the experimental sample was quenched by the addition of 3.5 μl of 200 mm 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate. The control sample received an equal volume of buffer. Transport reactions were conducted at room temperature (21 °C). Following all incubations, intraliposomal radiolabeled citrate was separated from the external radiolabel via chromatography on short (i.e. 4 cm) Dowex columns in Pasteur pipettes. However, with those incubations containing a high external citrate concentration, we employed longer (i.e. 8 cm) Dowex columns to ensure the effective removal of extraliposomal citrate. The eluted (i.e. intraliposomal) radiolabel was quantified via liquid scintillation counting. The 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate-sensitive transport rate was calculated by subtracting the control value from the experimental value. The rate of uptake versus substrate concentration curves were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = Vmax × S/(Km + S), using a non-linear least squares curve fit in GraphPad Prism. The final Km and Vmax values for each single-Cys CTP mutant, before and after modification with MTS reagents (see below), were calculated by taking the mean of the best fit Km and Vmax values derived from each separate V versus S profile. The measurement of the kinetic parameters following MTS labeling of the single-Cys mutants was conducted in a manner very similar to that described above. Consequently, only the methodological differences are described below. Proteoliposomes (45 μl) were preincubated with 3.5 μl of either buffer (experimental sample) or 200 mm 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (control sample) for 10 min and were then further incubated with 3.5 μl of MTS reagent (each MTS reagent concentration in the reaction mix = 1.0 mm) for an additional 10 min. The remaining procedures were exactly as described above. Molecular Modeling of the CTP—Molecular modeling was carried out using version 5 of DOCK (20Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Bodian D.L. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 380-397Crossref Scopus (374) Google Scholar), obtained from the University of California at San Francisco, and version 2005.06 of Molecular Operating Environment (MOE), obtained from Chemical Computing Group, Montreal. The homology-modeled CTP structure was constructed as described previously (16Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 907-911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Citrate, modeled in multiple conformations as a dianion, was initially docked into the CTP model using DOCK. In DOCK, five different scoring grids, centered at varying depths in the transport path, were utilized to ensure that all regions were thoroughly examined. The resulting docking poses were found to be clustered in two distinct regions of the translocation pathway. The first cluster was located about 10 Å into the pathway, centered around Lys-83, Arg-87, and Arg-189. The second cluster was located about 20 Å into the pathway, centered around Lys-37, Arg-181, Lys-239, Arg-276, and Arg-279. In the modeled CTP structure, these were found to be spread over too large an area to constitute a single binding site; even with side chains fully extended, the most distant residues are at least 20 Å apart. In contrast, a fully extended citrate molecule is <9 Å long. This result strongly suggested that there must be two citrate binding sites. We examined this possibility by mutating each of the above residues, as well as additional residues in the vicinity of these binding sites, to cysteine, one at a time. After kinetic analysis of these mutants verified the likely location of the above residues at a given citrate binding site, the two-binding site model was subjected to further refinement as follows. With all residues within 4.5 Å of the citrate, alternate side-chain conformations were explored using MOE. Models were then minimized using the CHARMM27 force field (21MacKerell Jr., A.D. Feig M. Brooks III, C.L. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1400-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2879) Google Scholar) in MOE. For each cluster, the most energetically favorable orientation was selected, producing two final proposed binding sites as described below. Kinetic Characterization of a Panel of Single-Cys CTP Substitution Mutants Hypothesized to Participate in Substrate Binding and/or in Other Aspects of the Transport Mechanism—The present investigations focused on the kinetic characterization of a panel of 30 single-Cys substitution mutants that were previously constructed (11Xu Y.

Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) utilizing the Cys-less CTP as the template. Mutations of four groups of residues were characterized. The first group consisted of eight arginine and lysine residues, which, based on our molecular modeling results (see “Experimental Procedures”), cluster in two topographically distinct regions within the transport pathway. Residues Lys-83, Arg-87, and Arg-189 constitute one cluster and were predicted to form one binding site, and residues Lys-37, Arg-181, Lys-239, Arg-276, and Arg-279 comprise the second cluster and were predicted to form a second binding site. Each cluster appeared capable of forming multiple ionic hydrogen bonds with citrate. The second group consisted of residues that were predicted to reside nearby a given substrate binding site but were thought unlikely to be its prime determinants. Thus, Leu-116, Gly-119, Leu-120, Ser-123, Gln-182, Asn-185, and Gln-186 were predicted to be near binding site one and residues Glu-34, Phe-76, Glu-131, Lys-134, Thr-228, Val-229, Asp-236, Thr-240, and Gln-243 were predicted to be near binding site two. The effect of Cys substitution at several of these locations had been characterized previously as part of our studies into the role of TMDs III and IV in CTP function (15Ma C. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Remani S. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2331-2340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Ma C. Remani S. Kotaria R. Mayor J.A. Walters D.E. Kaplan R.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1271-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The third group consisted of selected residues in matrix loops A (i.e. Thr-38, Arg-39, Asp-44, Lys-45, Ser-47, and Lys-48) and C (Asp-140, Lys-141, Gln-142, Ser-143, and Tyr-148). The rationale for exploring the role of these residues in CTP function was based upon findings with the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (22Kihira Y. Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Terada H. J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 23Hashimoto M. Shinohara Y. Majima E. Hatanaka T. Yamazaki N. Terada H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1409: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which suggested that, rather than project into the matrix compartment, these loops may in fact project into the translocation pathway during portions of the transport cycle and possibly assume an important role in the translocation mechanism. Finally, we characterized the mutation of Glu-122 because our previous studies indicated that this residue was essential for function. As depicted in Fig. 1 and Table 1, the mutated residues are located throughout the CTP structure.TABLE 1Effect of cysteine substitution on the CTP kinetic parametersMutationKmVmaxVmax/KmPredicted topographical locationnMnmol/min/mgnmol/min/mg/mM(%)Cys-less0.461 ± 0.0532305.0 ± 78.25000.0 (100)K83C>100NDaND, not determined.0.0 (0.0)TMD II, binding site oneR87C87.613 ± 58.863bValues are p < 0.05 from a two-tailed Student's t test between Cys-less and individual single-Cys mutants.0.2 ± 0.1cValues are p < 0.001.0.0 (0.0)TMD II, binding site oneG119C5.624 ± 1.224cValues are p < 0.001.0.3 ± 0.0cValues are p < 0.001.0.1 (0.0)TMD III, binding site oneR189C151.385 ± 59.715cValues are p < 0.001.2.4 ± 0.8cValues are p < 0.001.0.0 (0.0)TMD IV, binding site oneK37C2.817 ± 0.103cValues are p < 0.001.1.9 ± 0.1cValues are p < 0.001.0.7 (0.0)TMD I, binding site twoR181C24.085 ± 5.455cValues are p < 0.001.1.8 ± 0.1cValues are p < 0.001.0.1 (0.0)TMD IV, binding site twoK239C7.843 ± 2.405cValues are p < 0.001.43.3 ± 11.3cValues are p < 0.001.5.5 (0.1)TMD V, binding site twoR276C>100ND0.0 (0.0)TMD VI, binding site twoR279C3.721 ± 0.758cValues are p < 0.001.0.1 ± 0.0cValues are p < 0.001.0.0 (0.0)TMD VI, binding site twoE34C0.381 ± 0.03511.6 ± 0.3cValues are p < 0.001.30.4 (0.6)TMD I, near binding site twoT38C0.110 ± 0.018bValues are p < 0.05 from a two-tailed Student's t test between Cys-less and individual single-Cys mutants.307.2 ± 9.4cValues are p < 0.001.2792.7 (55.9)TMD I/Matrix Loop AR39C0.373 ± 0.0031732.0 ± 94.5dValues are p < 0.01.4643.4 (92.9)TMD I/Matrix Loop AD44C0.296 ± 0.065360.7 ± 11.8cValues are p < 0.001.1218.6 (24.4)Matrix Loop AK45C0.234 ± 0.030903.4 ± 25.4cValues are p < 0.001.3860.7 (77.2)Matrix Loop AS47C0.367 ± 0.0111102.0 ± 9.5cValues are p < 0.001.3002.7 (60.1)Matrix Loop AK48C0.297 ± 0.0421312.0 ± 63.5cValues are p < 0.001.4417.5 (88.4)Matrix Loop AF76C0.670 ± 0.194504.9 ± 2.2cValues are p < 0.001.753.6 (15.1)TMD II, near binding site twoL116C0.228 ± 0.008eData adapted from Ref. 15.

Further investigation has revealed the presence of an additional Cdk5 site identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis as Ser6. Basal levels of phospho-Ser6 inhibitor-1, as detected by a phosphorylation state-specific antibody against the site, existed in specific regions of the brain and varied with age. In the striatum, basal in vivo phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser6 were mediated by Cdk5, PP-2A, and PP-1, respectively. Additionally, calcineurin contributed to dephosphorylation under conditions of high Ca2+. In biochemical assays the function of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser6 and Ser67 was demonstrated to be an intramolecular impairment of the ability of inhibitor-1 to be dephosphorylated at Thr35; this effect was recapitulated in two systems in vivo. Dephosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Thr35 is equivalent to inactivation of the protein, as inhibitor-1 only serves as an inhibitor of PP-1 when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA) at Thr35. Thus, inhibitor-1 serves as a critical junction between kinase- and phosphatase-signaling pathways, linking PP-1 to not only PKA and calcineurin but also Cdk5.

Phosphatases are now recognized as important players in processes ranging from muscle contraction to synaptic plasticity.

Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In recent years, interest in the protein has focused on its role in heart failure and neuronal plasticity. In the brain, inhibitor-1 can be found in many areas including the olfactory bulb, neostriatum, cerebral cortex, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The level of inhibitor-1 in the rest of the hippocampus is a matter of some debate; reports range from little or none to moderate amounts (2.Allen P.B. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Errington M.L. Ramsay M.

Inhibitor-1 is a heat-stable 19-kDa protein that possesses little ordered structure and a preponderance of glutamic acid and proline in its amino acid sequence (7.Nimmo G.A. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 87: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). As a regulator of one of the three major serine/threonine phosphatases in mammalian cells that can itself be regulated by a major kinase, inhibitor-1 occupies an important position in neuronal signal transduction cascades. Only when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Thr35 does inhibitor-1 become a potent (IC50 = 1nm) and selective inhibitor of PP-1 (1.Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J.

Through its action on inhibitor-1, PKA can amplify cAMP signals by preventing the dephosphorylation of sites it shares with PP-1. That calcineurin (PP-2B, or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase) can inactivate I-1 by dephosphorylating the PKA site (10.Cohen P. Annu. Rev.

The ability of inhibitor-1 to link the actions of PKA and calcineurin to PP-1 has allowed it to occupy a central position in molecular models of synaptic plasticity. In 2001, inhibitor-1 was found to be phosphorylated at another residue (Ser67) by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) (13.Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A.

This phosphorylation did not have an effect on the ability of phospho-Thr35 inhibitor-1 to inhibit PP-1 and had only a mild effect on the ability of PKA to phosphorylate inhibitor-1 at Thr35. Despite its name, Cdk5 is not cyclin-dependent. Furthermore, unlike all other cyclin-dependent kinases, Cdk5 is most active in postmitotic neurons because of its requirement for the relatively neuron-specific cofactor, p35 (14.Lew J. Huang Q.Q.

In the past decade, Cdk5 has been implicated in many aspects of normal and abnormal neuronal function, including neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration. In this report, we show that inhibitor-1 is actually phosphorylated at two sites by Cdk5 in vitro and in vivo. Following discovery of the second site by phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analyses, mass spectrometric identification of the novel site as Ser6 was confirmed by in vitro phosphorylation of site-directed mutants. Basal levels of phospho-Ser6 inhibitor-1 as detected by a phosphorylation-state specific antibody generated against the site allowed demonstration of its relevance to in vivo systems. Pharmacological manipulation of both striatal lysates and striatal slices suggested that basal levels of phosphorylation at Ser6 are controlled by the opposing actions of Cdk5, PP-2A, and PP-1, whereas biochemical analyses revealed a novel intramolecular regulatory function for Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 that was recapitulated in two in vivo systems.

Transfection of PC12 Cells−Inhibitor-1 was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 FLAG (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and KpnI restriction sites and the following primers: 5′-CGGCCGAAGCTTATG GAGCCCGACAACAGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGGG TACCTCATTTATCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCCATGACCAAGCTGGCTCCTTGGG-3′. A C-terminal FLAG tag (underlined) was included in the primer design to avoid insertion of extraneous amino acids between the end of the protein and the FLAG tag. PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum in 10-cm plates. Experiments were conducted in 24-well pates coated with poly-d-lysine. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 h, the culture medium was replaced with medium containing one-tenth the normal amount of serum. Transfected cells were cultured for an additional 16 h before being treated with forskolin (5 μm, 10 min). After drug treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed directly in the plate with boiling 1% SDS containing 50 mm NaF. Lysates were boiled for 10 min and stored at -80 °C until further analysis. Immunoblot Analysis of Cell and Tissue Homogenates−Lysis and immunoblot analysis of striatal slices, as well as gross dissections of brain and body parts, were performed essentially as described (45.Sahin B.

However, samples for the peripheral distribution of inhibitor-1 had to be lysed in a different buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.4, 0.1 mm EGTA), boiled for 40 min, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min to eliminate a cross-reactive band at the same molecular weight. An equal amount of total protein (80-100 μg of brain homogenate, 25 μg of cleared peripheral tissue homogenate, or 25 μg of PC12 cell lysate) from each sample as determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA, Pierce) was analyzed. The membranes were immunoblotted using antibodies for phospho-Ser6 inhibitor-1 (1:750) (see “Results”), phospho-Ser67 inhibitor-1 (1:4000) (13.Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M.

All antibody incubations were in 5% milk plus Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 except that for phospho-Thr35 inhibitor-1, in which bovine serum albumin replaced milk. Data Analysis−NIH Image J was used to quantitate immunoblots. All results are stated as percentage decrease or fold increase of the mean ± error. Error of change was calculated from standard errors of the mean using error propagation formulas. Discovery, Identification, and Confirmation of Ser6 as a Novel Cdk5 Site of Inhibitor-1−Inhibitor-1 was reported previously to be phosphorylated by Cdk5 at Ser67 (13.Bibb J.A. Nishi A. O'Callaghan J.P. Ule J. Lan M. Snyder G.L. Horiuchi A. Saito T. Hisanaga S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14490-14497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide maps of wild-type and S67A inhibitor-1 phosphorylated by the proline-directed serine/threonine kinases Cdk1, MAPK, and Cdk5 were generated during the characterization of this phosphorylation site (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, unlike that for Cdk1 and MAPK, the phosphopeptide map for wild-type inhibitor-1 phosphorylated by Cdk5 revealed two major phosphopeptide species. Mutation of Ser67 to an alanine eliminated one of these phosphopeptide species, suggesting the presence of an additional site of Cdk5-dependent phosphorylation. Phosphoamino acid analysis of wild-type and S67A inhibitor-1 revealed the novel site to be a serine (Fig. 1B). S67A inhibitor-1 preparatively phosphorylated by Cdk5 in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP was next digested with Asp-N to facilitate identification of the novel site. MALDI-TOF MS of the digest revealed peaks at 1707.86 and 1613.20, representing the phosphorylated peptide 4DNSPRKIQFTVPLL17 and its daughter ion, respectively (Fig. 2A). The daughter ion, which resulted from a loss of H3PO4, formed a characteristic broad peak because of its inability to be focused on the MALDI-TOF detector (47.Campbell D.G. Morrice N.A. J. Biomol. Tech. 2002; 13: 119-130PubMed Google Scholar). Because Ser6 is the only serine or threonine directly followed by a proline in this fragment, it was concluded that it was the novel site of phosphorylation. As further confirmation, the proteolytic fragments were fractionated by capillary HPLC into a 96-well plate, and collected fractions were screened for radioactivity (Fig. 2B, top panel). Counts were found primarily in a single fraction, which produced a predominant Mr of 1708.26 by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Fig. 2B, middle panel). Upon treatment of a small portion of the fraction with alkaline phosphatase, a mass of 1708.26-80 Da (Mr PO3) = 1628.67 was observed (Fig. 2B, bottom panel), confirming that the peptide was phosphorylated. The identity of this peptide as 4DNSPRKIQFTVPLL17 was verified by Edman degradation microsequencing. These findings were supported by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation of both Ser6 and Ser67 resulted in no detectable phosphorylation by Cdk5 (Fig. 2C). Thus, Ser6 and Ser67 are the only sites of phosphorylation by Cdk5. Curiously, in in vitro phosphorylation reactions mutation of Ser6 to Ala decreased phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 by 44% after 1 h, whereas mutation of Ser67 to Ala decreased phosphorylation by 85% instead of the expected 66%. The incongruence of these numbers suggests that phosphorylation of Ser6 may have to follow that of Ser67. Indeed, phosphomimetic mutation of Ser67 to Asp more than doubled the ability of Cdk5 to phosphorylate Ser6, whereas phosphomimetic mutation of Ser6 did not affect the ability of Cdk5 to phosphorylate Ser67. Demonstration of the in Vivo Phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser6−To confirm the in vivo relevance of this novel phosphorylation event, a phosphorylation state-specific antibody to phospho-Ser6 inhibitor-1 was generated. Phosphospecificity of the purified antibody was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of recombinant wild-type or S6A inhibitor-1 preparatively phosphorylated or mock phosphorylated by Cdk5 (Fig. 3A). A strong signal was detected from wild-type inhibitor-1 incubated with Cdk5 but not wild-type inhibitor-1 incubated without Cdk5 or S6A inhibitor-1 incubated with Cdk5. In a tissue distribution analysis, basal levels of phospho-Ser6 inhibitor-1 were observed throughout the mouse brain in regions where total inhibitor-1 was detected, including the olfactory bulb, striatum, hippocampus, and cortex (Fig. 3B). In peripheral tissues, phospho-Ser67 and total inhibitor-1 could be detected in kidney, fat, gastrocnemius, and abdominal skeletal muscle. However, phosphorylation of inhibitor-1 at Ser6 was not detected in peripheral tissues, with the exception of fat (Fig. 3C). No signal was detected in the corresponding regions of I-1-/- mice (2.Allen P.B. Hvalby O. Jensen V. Errington M.L. Ramsay M. Chaudhry F.A. Bliss T.V. Storm-Mathisen J. Morris R.G. Andersen P.

Signaling through reversible protein phosphorylation is of great importance for proper functioning in eukaryotic cells. In the thylakoid membranes of plant cells, a large number of proteins are phosphorylated in response to light. The process is under complex regulation (reviewed in Ref. 1.Vener A.V. Demmig-Adams B.

However, the identity and exact role for all of the thylakoid phosphoproteins are still not known. A 12-kDa phosphoprotein was for long an enigmatic protein without known identity or function (16.Bhalla P. Bennett J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 252: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 17.Lindahl M. Carlberg I. Schröder W.P. Andersson B. Mathis P. Photosynthesis: From Light to Biosphere. Vol. III. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 321-324Google Scholar). Recently we identified this protein and named it TSP9, thylakoid-soluble phosphoprotein of 9 kDa (18.Carlberg I. Hansson M. Kieselbach T. Schroder W.P. Andersson B. Vener A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is a strongly basic protein that is phosphorylated on three threonine residues in the central part, in contrast to other thylakoid phosphoproteins, which are mainly phosphorylated at their N termini (reviewed in Ref. 1.Vener A.V. Demmig-Adams B. Adams W. Mattoo A.K. Photoprotection, Photoinhibition, Gene Regulation and Environment. Springer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2006: 107-126Google Scholar). TSP9 so far appears to be absolutely plant-specific. Searches in available data bases have revealed homologues in 49 different plant species but none from green algae or cyanobacteria. Upon phosphorylation, TSP9 is partially released from the membrane, and we have suggested that it could play a role in chloroplast signaling (18.Carlberg I. Hansson M. Kieselbach T. Schroder W.P. Andersson B. Vener A.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopic studies have shown that TSP9 is highly disordered in aqueous solution but adopts a more ordered conformation under membrane mimetic conditions (19.Song J. Lee M.S. Carlberg I. Vener A.V. Markley J.L. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15633-15643Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Intrinsically disordered proteins form a growing family of proteins commonly involved in recognition, regulation, and cell signaling that has only recently been recognized, presumably due to a strong bias in classical biochemical methods toward folded proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 20.Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar and 21.Uversky V.N. Oldfield C.J. Dunker A.K. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005; 18: 343-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Previous studies of TSP9 have also been restricted by the fact that it has only been recognized as a 32P-labeled band after electrophoresis of in vitro phosphorylated chloroplasts or thylakoid membranes. In the present work, we have used specific antibodies against TSP9 and revealed the localization of the protein in spinach thylakoid membranes by a combination of membrane subfractionation, chemical cross-linking, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry. Our observations indicate that TSP9 is closely associated with LHCII and the supercomplexes of PSII. Preparation and Subfractionation of Thylakoid Membranes−Thylakoid membranes were prepared from 7-week-old dark-adapted spinach as described (22.Andersson B. Akerlund H.E. Albertsson P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 423: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 0.1 m sorbitol, 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2 and 10 mm KCl. Subfractionation of thylakoids into grana- and stroma-exposed membranes was done by treatment with 0.2% digitonin essentially as described in Ref. 23.Carlberg I. Bingsmark S. Vennigerholz F. Larsson U.K. Andersson B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1099: 111-117Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar. Grana membranes were further purified according to Ref. 24.Cline K.

Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting−Thylakoid proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semidry electroblotter. Membranes were incubated with antibodies as indicated in the figure legends and developed using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, GE Healthcare) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The result was recorded using a CCD camera. TSP9-specific antibodies were raised in rabbit against a recombinant TSP9 protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Blue-native PAGE (BN-PAGE)/SDS-PAGE−BN-PAGE (26.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar) was performed essentially as described in Ref. 27.Suorsa M. Regel R.E. Paakkarinen V. Battchikova N. Herrmann R.G. Aro E.M.

Thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 20% (w/v) glycerol, 25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, at a chlorophyll concentration of 2 mg chl/ml. An equal volume of 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside in resuspension buffer was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 3 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min, the supernatant was supplemented with 0.1 volume sample buffer (100 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5 m ε-amino-n-caproic acid, 30% (w/v) sucrose, 50 mg/ml Serva blue G) and subjected to BN-PAGE with a gradient of 5–13.5% acrylamide in the separation gel. The electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C at 100 V for 3–4 h. For separation of proteins in the second dimension, lanes were cut out and incubated with 5% β-mercaptoethanol in SDS sample buffer for 30 min at room temperature and subjected to SDS-PAGE with 15% acrylamide in the separation gel in the second dimension. Sucrose Gradient Centrifugation−Thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl to a concentration of 1 mg chl/ml and solubilized with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, the sample was applied to a continuous sucrose gradient made by freezing and slowly thawing (4 °C) 0.6 m sucrose, 25 mm Tricine, pH 7.9, containing 0.06% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Gradients were centrifuged in a SW41-Ti rotor (Beckman) at 180,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C. Reversible Protein Cross-linking and Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE−Thylakoids (0.5 mg chl/ml) were treated with newly made dithiobis(succinimidyl-propionate) (DSP) (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a final concentration of 50 mm and incubated on ice for 30 min. Thylakoids were washed twice and finally resuspended in SDS sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE with 15% acrylamide in the separation gel in the first dimension, and lanes were cut out, incubated for 15 min in SDS sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. Immunoprecipitation−Immunoprecipitation was performed essentially as described in Ref. 28.Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar with minor modifications. Cross-linked thylakoid membranes were solubilized in 1% SDS in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 0.5 mg chl/ml for 5 min at 37 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. 180 μl of supernatant was combined with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA in TBS (immunoprecipitation buffer) plus 50 μl of TSP9 antiserum. After end-over-end mixing at 4 °C for 1 h, 200 μl of a 50% “slurry” of protein A-Sepharose was added, and the mixture was end-over-end incubated overnight at 4 °C. The protein A-Sepharose was collected by centrifugation and washed with 3 × 1.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer and 1 × 1.5 ml of 0.05% Triton X-100 in TBS. Protein was eluted with SDS sample buffer containing 6 m urea. Protein Phosphorylation−Phosphorylation of thylakoid membranes was performed essentially as described previously (29.Carlberg I. Rintamaki E. Aro E.M. Andersson B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes (0.2 mg chl/ml) were illuminated at 120 μmol of photons m–2 s–1 for 20 min at room temperature in the presence of 0.5 mm ATP containing [γ-32P]ATP and 10 mm NaF. The experiments were analyzed by phosphorimaging (Fuji). Protein Digestion with Trypsin−For in-gel digestion, the protein bands were excised from the gel and treated with trypsin (sequencing grade modified trypsin, Promega) essentially according to the procedure described by Shevchenko et al. (30.Shevchenko A. Chernushevic I. Wilm M. Mann M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Peptides were desalted on C18 reverse-phase ZipTip (Millipore) and eluted with 50% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry−The spectra were acquired on a hybrid mass spectrometer API QSTAR Pulsar i (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Protana, Odense, Denmark). The collision-induced dissociation of selected precursor ions was performed using the instrument settings recommended by Applied Biosystems and manual control of collision energy. To establish the cellular and subcellular localization of the TSP9 protein, we generated specific antibodies against a full-size recombinant protein. These antibodies were used for detection of TSP9 in the different membranes and compartments in the plant cell after subfractionation of spinach leaves by several different methods. Initially a filtered leaf homogenate from dark-adapted plants was subjected to differential centrifugation. When the homogenate was first separated into a low spin (2,000 × g) membranous fraction and a soluble fraction, no TSP9 was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1A). When the membranous fraction (consisting primarily of chloroplasts) was lysed and further fractionated, TSP9 was highly retained in the thylakoids (Fig. 1A). This type of fractionation does not exclude the presence of minor amounts of TSP9 elsewhere yet clearly shows that TSP9 is associated with the thylakoid membrane in dark-adapted plants. The possible presence of TSP9 in the chloroplast envelope has been reported in an earlier proteomics study (31.Froehlich J.E. Wilkerson C.G. Ray W.K. McAndrew R.S. Osteryoung K.W. Gage D.A. Phinney B.S. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), although the envelope fraction characterized in this work was slightly contaminated by thylakoid membranes. To test the possible presence of TSP9 in the chloroplast envelope, envelopes were isolated by sucrose density centrifugation and other methods (31.Froehlich J.E. Wilkerson C.G. Ray W.K. McAndrew R.S. Osteryoung K.W. Gage D.A. Phinney B.S. J. Proteome Res. 2003; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 32.Douce R. Holtz R.B. Benson A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7215-7222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we did not find any TSP9 in these preparations that could not be ascribed to contamination by thylakoid membranes, as judged by the immunological assay of the LHCII content (data not shown). Plant thylakoids consist of two major membrane domains: the highly stacked membranes, so-called grana, as well as non-stacked, stroma membranes (33.Albertsson P.A. Andreasson E. Svensson P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 273: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Many of the thylakoid protein complexes are heterogeneously distributed among the different parts of the membrane. Although PSII is predominantly found in the stacked grana regions, PSI and ATP synthase are situated mainly in the non-stacked stroma membranes. When isolated spinach thylakoids were fractionated into grana and stroma membranes by digitonin treatment and differential centrifugation, TSP9 was found in both membrane fractions but was highly enriched in the grana membranes (Fig. 1B). The distribution of TSP9 between the grana and stroma membranes was very similar to that of the PSII reaction center protein D1 and the major LHCII proteins (Fig. 1B). Thus, the results of the localization experiments demonstrated that, at least for dark-adapted plant leaves, the TSP9 protein is located exclusively in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, where it is highly enriched in the stacked grana membranes together with PSII and LHCII. We have not been able to specifically localize the phosphorylated form of TSP9 in thylakoid subfractions, presumably due to a release from the membrane under the subfractionation conditions. Several lines of data indicate that the phosphorylated form of TSP9 is more loosely attached to the membrane. As we have shown earlier, and as can be seen in Fig. 2, whereas relatively little 32P-labeled TSP9 remains attached to the membrane after NaBr treatment (Fig. 2A), a large amount of TSP9 protein is still present in the membrane fraction (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2C, it can be seen that recombinant TSP9 is strongly phosphorylated by thylakoid membranes and that a large part of the phosphorylated protein is found in the soluble fraction. In contrast, non-phosphorylated recombinant protein largely remains associated with the membrane (Fig. 2D). These results further support the view that phosphorylated TSP9 is loosely attached to the membrane. Unfortunately, due to lack of reaction of phospho-TSP9 with commercially available phosphoamino acid-specific antibodies, we have so far not been able to assess the in vivo phosphorylation status of TSP9. To determine the possible association of TSP9 with distinct membrane protein complexes, we performed blue-native electrophoresis, which has been successfully used in the analysis of thylakoid membranes (34.Ciambella C. Roepstorff P. Aro E.M. Zolla L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 35.Kügler M. Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 35-44Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes were subjected to mild solubilization using 1% dodecylmaltoside before electrophoretic separation under non-denaturing conditions. To demonstrate the presence of TSP9 among the complexes, lanes from the BN-electrophoresis were run in the second dimension on completely denaturing SDS-PAGE. Western blotting of the two-dimensional gels with TSP9 antibodies showed that TSP9 was indeed associated with a number of high molecular mass protein complexes (Fig. 3, A and B). Reprobing the membrane with antibodies against LHCII showed that TSP9 to a large extent colocalized with LHCII, indicating a close association with the antenna of PSII. We observed TSP9 in the positions of both LHCII monomers and trimers, but we also found smaller amounts of TSP9 in larger complexes in positions where PSII monomers and dimers, respectively, migrate. However, in these positions, other complexes such as PSI, ATP synthase, and cytochrome bf are also localized (34.Ciambella C. Roepstorff P. Aro E.M. Zolla L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 746-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and we cannot exclude an association of TSP9 with any of these. To verify the association of TSP9 with the membrane protein complexes by a different separation technique, continuous sucrose density gradient was used. When thylakoid membranes solubilized by 1% dodecylmaltoside were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation, the low molecular mass TSP9 protein migrated with high molecular mass complexes, as can be seen in Fig. 3C. The migration of TSP9 in the gradient was very close to that of PSII, as indicated by immunoblotting for the D1 protein, whereas TSP9- and LHCII-containing fractions had only partial overlap. However, when the thylakoid membranes were treated with cross-linker (see further below) before solubilization and centrifugation, TSP9 and LHCII were found co-localized in the same gradient fractions (Fig. 3D). These observations confirm an association of TSP9 with LHCII but also suggest a localization of this protein in the membrane in the vicinity of the PSII core, which was indeed already indicated by the result from the BN-PAGE (Fig. 3B). To obtain more detailed information concerning the location of TSP9, we used the bifunctional cleavable cross-linker DSP, which is reactive toward amino groups and has a cleavable disulfide and a 12 Å spacer arm (36.Lomant A.J. Fairbanks G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 243-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This cross-linker has earlier been used in nearest neighbor analysis of isolated photosynthetic complexes (37.Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 38.Zhang S. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3180-3187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When thylakoid membranes were treated with DSP, the TSP9 protein became highly cross-linked in a manner that could be completely reversed by incubation with a reducing agent (Fig. 4A). To obtain information about possible cross-link partners, cross-linked thylakoid membranes were separated on SDS-PAGE without the addition of reductant in the first dimension, and lanes were cut out, incubated with β-mercaptoethanol, and subjected to a second SDS-PAGE. Proteins that are not cross-linked (or without disulfides affecting migration) will migrate on a diagonal, whereas proteins that are cross-linked will appear as spots below. Western blotting of such two-dimensional gels showed that TSP9 was present in complexes of many different sizes (Fig. 4B). Among the larger complexes, seen as a more or less continuous band in the left part of the blot, we can distinguish a more intense, varyingly well resolved part originating from complexes of around 50–60 kDa. Apart from these, we also always observed TSP9 in at least two distinct spots originating from complexes with molecular masses ranging between 40 and 30 kDa (Fig. 4B). Two-dimensional gels of cross-linked samples were stained with Coomassie Blue or silver to detect the possible cross-linked partners (Fig. 4C). Particularly noticeable on these gels is the large amount of highly stained spots in the 25–30-kDa region, indicating strong cross-linking of LHCII polypeptides. By a comparison between polyvinylidene difluoride membranes stained after blotting and stained gels of the same samples, a number of putative cross-linked partners of TSP9 were identified. In Fig. 4C, these protein spots are circled and indicated by the approximate molecular mass of the original cross-link complexes. The five protein spots indicated in Fig. 4C, which all aligned well with the TSP9-containing spots, were cut out from the Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gel and in-gel digested with trypsin, and the extracted peptides were desalted and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Individual peptide ions from these samples were subjected to collision-induced dissociation, which allowed determination of partial amino acid peptide sequences and identification of the corresponding proteins. Since the total genome of spinach has not been determined, the identification was partially based on homology with Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. The results are presented in Table 1 (and supplemental Figs. 1 and 2).TABLE 1Sequences of tryptic peptides determined by mass spectrometric analysis of protein spots from two-dimensional gel after in-gel digestion and homolog sequences found in database searchesComplexExperimental mass (MH+)MS/MS sequencingaX indicates not exact identified amino acid; L indicates L or I (same mass); [XX] indicates order not confirmed.Homolog sequencebAmino acids in brackets indicate amino acid preceding/following actual peptide.Theoretical mass (MH+)Homolog proteincSpinach (spiol), Arabidopsis thaliana gene (AtNgNNNNN), Oryza sativa (orysa), tomato (lyces), Pyrobys statella (pyrst).kDa602408, 12XXXXXXXXXXGLADD-XXAFAELK(K) VYPGGSFDPLGLADD-PEAFAELK2408, 17(P) LYPGGSFDPLGLADD-PEAFAELKCB2A_spiol (Lhcb1)(K) VYPGGAFDPLGLADD-PDTFAELKCB23_orysa55904, 47PEAFAELK(D) PEAFAELK904, 48CB2A_spiol (Lhcb1)551264, 61[GP] LENLADXXAD(K) GPLENLADHLAD (P)1264, 62CB2A_spiol (Lhcb1)551280, 61[GP] LENLSDHLAD(K) GPIENLSDHIAD (P)1280, 61Lyces AAA34142 (Lhcb1/2)551317, 57[GP] LEXXADXXXXX(K) GPLENLADHLAAP (G)1317, 68Pyrst Q39631 (Lhcb1/2)551421, 69XXSSGSPWYXXXR(K) NVSSGSPWYGPDR1421, 65CB2C_spiol (Lhcb1)dCB2C_spiol and from Ref. 66.551098, 57VGGGPLGEGLDK(R) VGGGPLGEVVDK1098, 58CB23_orysa (Lhcb2)551029, 61XXAGDLLXXR(K) NLAGDLLCTR1029, 57(K) NLAGDVIGTRAt5g01530 (lhcb4.1)(K) NVAGDIIGII (Q)At2g40100 (lhcb4.3)551711, 85XXSLQPYSEVFXXQR(−) STSLQPYSEVFGLQR1711, 87Spiol AAB33000 (Lhcb4)55970, 51XXDQAALLK(K) DPDQAAILK970, 52Lyces CAA43590 (Lhcb5)551152, 59LTDGLDFEDK(R) ITNGLDFEDK1151, 56At4g10340 (lhcb5)551696, 87XXALLLDGNTLNYFGK(K) TGĀLLLDGNTLNYFGK1696, 89At4g10340 (lhcb5)501235, 59FVDEPTTXXEK(R) FVDEPTTGLEK1235, 62psbS_spiol40904, 47PEAFAELK(D) PEAFAELK904, 48CB2A_spiol (Lhcb1)401264, 59[GP] LENLADXXXX(K) GPLENLADHLAD (P)1264, 62CB2A_spiol (Lhcb1)401098, 57VGGGPLGEXXDK(R) VGGGPLGEVVDK1098, 58CB23_orysa (Lhcb2)401230, 63VLESST [PV] VXXK(N) VLESSTPVVDGK1230, 66psbP_spiol30883, 51TAVNPLLR(R) TAVNPLLR883, 54psaL_spiol301511, 77XXEPSLA [PA] LTLTXX(K) EGEPSIAPALTLTGR1511, 81psaL_spiol301347, 69LYADDSAXXXALK(K) LYADDSAPALAIK1347, 72psaF_spiol301377, 63XXL [NG] ELVDNNF(R) ELLNGELVDNNF (−)1377, 67psaF_spiol301270, 63[GV] GSVVAVDQDXX(K) GVGSVVAVDQDPK1270, 66psaE_spiola X indicates not exact identified amino acid; L indicates L or I (same mass); [XX] indicates order not confirmed.b Amino acids in brackets indicate amino acid preceding/following actual peptide.c Spinach (spiol), Arabidopsis thaliana gene (AtNgNNNNN), Oryza sativa (orysa), tomato (lyces), Pyrobys statella (pyrst).d CB2C_spiol and from Ref. 66.Walcher W.

Open table in a new tab The summary of the protein identification presented in Table 1 shows that the spots originating from cross-linked complexes of 60, 55, and 40 kDa contained different peptides from LHCII (for a review on Lhcb proteins, see Ref. 39.Jansson S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 236-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The masses of mature LHCII peptides are 24–27 kDa, which is in agreement with spots cut out below the 30-kDa marker in the second dimension. In the “60-kDa spot,” we could only find one peptide, a homologue to Arabidopsis thaliana Lhcb1. On the other hand, in the “55-kDa spot,” several different peptides were sequenced and found highly homologous to the following proteins from A. thaliana: Lhcb1 (five peptides), Lhcb2 (one peptide), Lhcb4/CP29 (two peptides), and Lhcb5/CP26 (three peptides). This protein spot was the largest and most heavily stained on the two-dimensional gel (Fig. 4C). The approximate molecular mass of the cross-linked complex suggests that we here find cross-linked products that in addition to TSP9 contain different dimers of Lhcb peptides. Notably, the reliable identification of the minor light-harvesting proteins CP29 and CP26 in the 55-kDa complex (Table 1) indicates that TSP9 could be localized at the interface between PSII and the adjacent LHCII. CP29 and CP26 serve the role of linker proteins connecting LHCII to the PSII core proteins (40.Hankamer B. Morris E. Nield J. Gerle C. Barber J. J. Struct.

https://openalex.org/W2155398834,"Gastrointestinal (GI) hormones play an important role in GI secretion, motility, and eating behaviors. It was recently suggested that GI hormones may have a trophic role in GI tract. Here we demonstrate that two principal GI hormones, anorexigenic peptide YY (PYY) and orexigenic ghrelin, affect neural tube development. Chronic administration into the pregnant mice or transgenic overexpression of PYY led to a neural tube defect (NTD) in the embryos that was blocked by ghrelin. PYY Y1 receptor antagonist prevented the occurrence of NTD induced not only by PYY but also by vitamin A, a well-known teratogen in humans and animals. Y1 receptor deficiency also engendered NTDs, indicating the need to maintain normal Y1 receptor signaling. The present study is the first linking GI hormones to the leading cause of infant mortality and provides a novel insight for neurogenesis in which materno-fetal communication through GI hormones appears to be important."
