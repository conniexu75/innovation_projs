P(325)-Labeled RNA was not found in the brain after intraperitoneal administration. Even intraventricular injections of nucleic acid produced no ""transfer"" effect."
https://openalex.org/W2090217343,Three experiments investigated shape constancy in human infants between 50 and 60 days of age. The first showed that such infants possess some capacity for shape constancy. The second confirmed this finding and showed that the capacity is not attained by correlation of perceived projective shape with perceived orientation.

https://openalex.org/W2034748923,"In monocular tests, normally reared infant rats, aged 21 to 22 days, fail to show a side preference on the visual-cliff apparatus. Rats of the same age, but reared in an ""enriched"" environment, prefer the shallow side of the apparatus. In binocular tests, even normally reared animals prefer the shallow side, although experimentally reared animals show a stronger preference. The results appear to reopen the question of what cues are employed on the visual cliff."
