https://openalex.org/W1949922239,"Real-time direct interfaces between the brain and electronic and mechanical devices could one day be used to restore sensory and motor functions lost through injury or disease. Hybrid brainâ€“machine interfaces also have the potential to enhance our perceptual, motor and cognitive capabilities by revolutionizing the way we use computers and interact with remote environments."

https://openalex.org/W1660272337,Representations of cellular processes that can be used to compute their future behaviour would be of general scientific and practical value. But past attempts to construct such representations have been disappointing. This is now changing. Increases in biological understanding combined with advances in computational methods and in computer power make it possible to foresee construction of useful and predictive simulations of cellular processes.

https://openalex.org/W1985896258,"Although monkeys can perceive complex stimuli such as faces1, only the higher apes are capable of recognizing their own face in a mirror2. Here we show that in humans the right hemisphere of the brain seems to be preferentially involved in self-face recognition. Our findings indicate that neural substrates of the right hemisphere may selectively participate in processes linked to self-awareness."

https://openalex.org/W2135391746,The disciplines of artificial intelligence and artificial life build computational systems inspired by various aspects of life. Despite the fact that living systems are composed only of non-living atoms there seems to be limits in the current levels of understanding within these disciplines in what is necessary to bridge the gap between non-living and living matter.

https://openalex.org/W1482291024,"Imagine that we could let the world's economy continue to grow, bring the disadvantaged classes up from poverty and at the same time not threaten the atmosphere or global ecosystems with unprecedented build-up of greenhouse gases and the projected climatic risks of such growth. Earth systems engineering and management may just be such a panacea, some have suggested. But could we anticipate the costs or ever truly predict the consequences?"

https://openalex.org/W1657677577,"Deleterious alleles seem to have been purged in a feral strain of inbred cows. Inbreeding, which can lead to the loss of genetic variation or the accumulation of deleterious alleles, has been shown to reduce fitness in wild1, zoo, laboratory2 and farmed3 animals. But it has been proposed that when combined with selection, inbreeding may purge deleterious alleles4. Here we provide support for this hypothesis in a study of the Chillingham cattle, which shows that this viable herd is almost genetically uniform. The homozygosity of this herd far exceeds that of other cattle5 and that found in wild populations of other mammalian species6,7."

If accelerators are to reach the ever-higher energies that theorists would dearly like to see explored, the technological spin-offs of this engineering feat could be as surprising as the new subatomic physics."
https://openalex.org/W1527319263,"Basic science has been the wellspring of advances in technology in everything from cellular phones to nutrient-fortified foods. Biochemistry and food technology afford new techniques that enrich nutritional science and aid in the fight against malnutrition. Bionutrition, the term used to describe the application of these techniques, can be the source of innovations that will help eradicate malnutrition globally. Which areas of bionutrition research are most likely to yield tomorrow's breakthroughs?"
