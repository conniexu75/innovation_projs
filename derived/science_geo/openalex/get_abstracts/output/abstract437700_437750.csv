https://openalex.org/W2000432942,"Chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (a neonicotinoid and a pyrethroid) independently and in combination, at concentrations approximating field-level exposure, impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality, with knock-on effects for brood development and colony success. Exposure to neonicotinoid pesticides is known to influence bee behaviour, and could be a key factor in current bee declines. It has not been possible to establish a mechanistic link between individual and colony effects, but this study demonstrates a direct link between detrimental behavioural effects and field-level pesticide exposure — to neonicotinoid and pyrethroid — in individual worker bumblebees, and consequent impacts on colony development and survival. The pesticides reduce the effectiveness of foraging behaviour, with knock-on effects on brood care and colony productivity. Reported widespread declines of wild and managed insect pollinators have serious consequences for global ecosystem services and agricultural production1,2,3. Bees contribute approximately 80% of insect pollination, so it is important to understand and mitigate the causes of current declines in bee populations 4,5,6. Recent studies have implicated the role of pesticides in these declines, as exposure to these chemicals has been associated with changes in bee behaviour7,8,9,10,11 and reductions in colony queen production12. However, the key link between changes in individual behaviour and the consequent impact at the colony level has not been shown. Social bee colonies depend on the collective performance of many individual workers. Thus, although field-level pesticide concentrations can have subtle or sublethal effects at the individual level8, it is not known whether bee societies can buffer such effects or whether it results in a severe cumulative effect at the colony level. Furthermore, widespread agricultural intensification means that bees are exposed to numerous pesticides when foraging13,14,15, yet the possible combinatorial effects of pesticide exposure have rarely been investigated16,17. Here we show that chronic exposure of bumblebees to two pesticides (neonicotinoid and pyrethroid) at concentrations that could approximate field-level exposure impairs natural foraging behaviour and increases worker mortality leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success. We found that worker foraging performance, particularly pollen collecting efficiency, was significantly reduced with observed knock-on effects for forager recruitment, worker losses and overall worker productivity. Moreover, we provide evidence that combinatorial exposure to pesticides increases the propensity of colonies to fail."
https://openalex.org/W2160737695,"Martell et al. engineer APEX, a protein tag for electron microscopy that does not require light activation, enabling the imaging of subcellular protein localization in large or thick sections. Electron microscopy (EM) is the standard method for imaging cellular structures with nanometer resolution, but existing genetic tags are inactive in most cellular compartments1 or require light and can be difficult to use2. Here we report the development of 'APEX', a genetically encodable EM tag that is active in all cellular compartments and does not require light. APEX is a monomeric 28-kDa peroxidase that withstands strong EM fixation to give excellent ultrastructural preservation. We demonstrate the utility of APEX for high-resolution EM imaging of a variety of mammalian organelles and specific proteins using a simple and robust labeling procedure. We also fused APEX to the N or C terminus of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU), a recently identified channel whose topology is disputed3,4. These fusions give EM contrast exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix, suggesting that both the N and C termini of MCU face the matrix. Because APEX staining is not dependent on light activation, APEX should make EM imaging of any cellular protein straightforward, regardless of the size or thickness of the specimen."

We sought to identify brain regions that accumulate information over short and long timescales and to characterize the distinguishing features of their dynamics. We recorded electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals from individuals watching intact and scrambled movies. Within sensory regions, fluctuations of high-frequency (64-200 Hz) power reliably tracked instantaneous low-level properties of the intact and scrambled movies. Within higher order regions, the power fluctuations were more reliable for the intact movie than the scrambled movie, indicating that these regions accumulate information over relatively long time periods (several seconds or longer). Slow (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations of high-frequency power with time courses locked to the movies were observed throughout the cortex. Slow fluctuations were relatively larger in regions that accumulated information over longer time periods, suggesting a connection between slow neuronal population dynamics and temporally extended information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2034651748,"Malignant migrating partial seizures of infancy (MMPSI) is a rare epileptic encephalopathy of infancy that combines pharmacoresistant seizures with developmental delay. We performed exome sequencing in three probands with MMPSI and identified de novo gain-of-function mutations affecting the C-terminal domain of the KCNT1 potassium channel. We sequenced KCNT1 in 9 additional individuals with MMPSI and identified mutations in 4 of them, in total identifying mutations in 6 out of 12 unrelated affected individuals. Functional studies showed that the mutations led to constitutive activation of the channel, mimicking the effects of phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain by protein kinase C. In addition to regulating ion flux, KCNT1 has a non-conducting function, as its C terminus interacts with cytoplasmic proteins involved in developmental signaling pathways. These results provide a focus for future diagnostic approaches and research for this devastating condition."
https://openalex.org/W2167711201,"Abnormal activation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-Akt signaling is implicated in the development of various diseases, including heart failure. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate activation of this signaling pathway are not completely understood. Here we show that sirtuin 6 (SIRT6), a nuclear histone deacetylase, functions at the level of chromatin to directly attenuate IGF-Akt signaling. SIRT6-deficient mice developed cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, whereas SIRT6 transgenic mice were protected from hypertrophic stimuli, indicating that SIRT6 acts as a negative regulator of cardiac hypertrophy. SIRT6-deficient mouse hearts showed hyperactivation of IGF signaling-related genes and their downstream targets. Mechanistically, SIRT6 binds to and suppresses the promoter of IGF signaling-related genes by interacting with c-Jun and deacetylating histone 3 at Lys9 (H3K9). We also found reduced SIRT6 expression in human failing hearts. These findings disclose a new link between SIRT6 and IGF-Akt signaling and implicate SIRT6 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure."
https://openalex.org/W2097897519,"NMR spectroscopy is used to determine the three-dimensional structure of the full-length human chemokine receptor CXCR1 in phospholipid bilayers under physiological conditions. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ubiquitous membrane proteins that transduce chemical signals from the outside of a cell, and many of them are drug targets. Sang Ho Park et al. present a new nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy method for the study of membrane proteins in phospholipid bilayers and use it to determine the structure of human CXCR1, a high-affinity GPCR for interleukin-8, a major mediator of immune and inflammatory responses. CXCR1 is one of two high-affinity receptors for the CXC chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8), a major mediator of immune and inflammatory responses implicated in many disorders, including tumour growth1,2,3. IL-8, released in response to inflammatory stimuli, binds to the extracellular side of CXCR1. The ligand-activated intracellular signalling pathways result in neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation2. CXCR1 is a class A, rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), the largest class of integral membrane proteins responsible for cellular signal transduction and targeted as drug receptors4,5,6,7. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanism of CXCR1 signal transduction is poorly understood owing to the limited structural information available. Recent structural determination of GPCRs has advanced by modifying the receptors with stabilizing mutations, insertion of the protein T4 lysozyme and truncations of their amino acid sequences8, as well as addition of stabilizing antibodies and small molecules9 that facilitate crystallization in cubic phase monoolein mixtures10. The intracellular loops of GPCRs are crucial for G-protein interactions11, and activation of CXCR1 involves both amino-terminal residues and extracellular loops2,12,13. Our previous nuclear magnetic resonance studies indicate that IL-8 binding to the N-terminal residues is mediated by the membrane, underscoring the importance of the phospholipid bilayer for physiological activity14. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of human CXCR1 determined by NMR spectroscopy. The receptor is in liquid crystalline phospholipid bilayers, without modification of its amino acid sequence and under physiological conditions. Features important for intracellular G-protein activation and signal transduction are revealed. The structure of human CXCR1 in a lipid bilayer should help to facilitate the discovery of new compounds that interact with GPCRs and combat diseases such as breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2000654425,"As the main microtubule-organizing centre in animal cells, the centrosome has a fundamental role in cell function. Surrounding the centrioles, the pericentriolar material (PCM) provides a dynamic platform for nucleating microtubules. Although the importance of the PCM is established, its amorphous electron-dense nature has made it refractory to structural investigation. By using SIM and STORM subdiffraction-resolution microscopies to visualize proteins critical for centrosome maturation, we demonstrate that the PCM is organized into two main structural domains: a layer juxtaposed to the centriole wall, and proteins extending farther away from the centriole organized in a matrix. Analysis of Pericentrin-like protein (PLP) reveals that its carboxy terminus is positioned at the centriole wall, it radiates outwards into the matrix and is organized in clusters having quasi-nine-fold symmetry. By RNA-mediated interference (RNAi), we show that PLP fibrils are required for interphase recruitment and proper mitotic assembly of the PCM matrix."
https://openalex.org/W1995658722,"We performed genomic mapping of a family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) and intellectual and psychiatric problems, identifying a disease-associated region on chromosome 9q34.3. Whole-exome sequencing identified a mutation in KCNT1, encoding a sodium-gated potassium channel subunit. KCNT1 mutations were identified in two additional families and a sporadic case with severe ADNFLE and psychiatric features. These findings implicate the sodium-gated potassium channel complex in ADNFLE and, more broadly, in the pathogenesis of focal epilepsies."
https://openalex.org/W2048787904,"Neutralizing antibodies are likely to play a crucial part in a preventative HIV-1 vaccine. Although efforts to elicit broadly cross-neutralizing (BCN) antibodies by vaccination have been unsuccessful, a minority of individuals naturally develop these antibodies after many years of infection. How such antibodies arise, and the role of viral evolution in shaping these responses, is unknown. Here we show, in two HIV-1-infected individuals who developed BCN antibodies targeting the glycan at Asn332 on the gp120 envelope, that this glycan was absent on the initial infecting virus. However, this BCN epitope evolved within 6 months, through immune escape from earlier strain-specific antibodies that resulted in a shift of a glycan to position 332. Both viruses that lacked the glycan at amino acid 332 were resistant to the Asn332-dependent BCN monoclonal antibody PGT128 (ref. 8), whereas escaped variants that acquired this glycan were sensitive. Analysis of large sequence and neutralization data sets showed the 332 glycan to be significantly under-represented in transmitted subtype C viruses compared to chronic viruses, with the absence of this glycan corresponding with resistance to PGT128. These findings highlight the dynamic interplay between early antibodies and viral escape in driving the evolution of conserved BCN antibody epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W2031941215,"The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a complex process that occurs during organogenesis and in cancer metastasis. Despite recent progress, the molecular pathways connecting the physiological and pathological functions of EMT need to be better defined. Here we show that the transcription factor Elf5, a key regulator of mammary gland alveologenesis, controls EMT in both mammary gland development and metastasis. We uncovered this role for Elf5 through analyses of Elf5 conditional knockout animals, various in vitro and in vivo models of EMT and metastasis, an MMTV-neu transgenic model of mammary tumour progression and clinical breast cancer samples. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Elf5 suppresses EMT by directly repressing the transcription of Snail2, a master regulator of mammary stem cells and a known inducer of EMT. These findings establish Elf5 not only as a key cell lineage regulator during normal mammary gland development, but also as a suppressor of EMT and metastasis in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2112823205,"Reminders of the past can trigger the recollection of events that one would rather forget. Here, using fMRI, we demonstrate two distinct neural mechanisms that foster the intentional forgetting of such unwanted memories. Both mechanisms impair long-term retention by limiting momentary awareness of the memories, yet they operate in opposite ways. One mechanism, direct suppression, disengages episodic retrieval through the systemic inhibition of hippocampal processing that originates from right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC). The opposite mechanism, thought substitution, instead engages retrieval processes to occupy the limited focus of awareness with a substitute memory. It is mediated by interactions between left caudal and midventrolateral PFC that support the selective retrieval of substitutes in the context of prepotent, unwanted memories. These findings suggest that we are not at the mercy of passive forgetting; rather, our memories can be shaped by two opposite mechanisms of mnemonic control."
https://openalex.org/W1965378998,"ETS transcription factors ETV2, FLI1, and ERG1 specify pluripotent stem cells into induced vascular endothelial cells (iVECs). However, iVECs are unstable and drift toward nonvascular cells. We show that human midgestation c-Kit(-) lineage-committed amniotic cells (ACs) can be reprogrammed into vascular endothelial cells (rAC-VECs) without transitioning through a pluripotent state. Transient ETV2 expression in ACs generates immature rAC-VECs, whereas coexpression with FLI1/ERG1 endows rAC-VECs with a vascular repertoire and morphology matching mature endothelial cells (ECs). Brief TGFβ-inhibition functionalizes VEGFR2 signaling, augmenting specification of ACs into rAC-VECs. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses showed that rAC-VECs are similar to adult ECs in which vascular-specific genes are expressed and nonvascular genes are silenced. Functionally, rAC-VECs form stable vasculature in Matrigel plugs and regenerating livers. Therefore, short-term ETV2 expression and TGFβ inhibition with constitutive ERG1/FLI1 coexpression reprogram mature ACs into durable rAC-VECs with clinical-scale expansion potential. Banking of HLA-typed rAC-VECs establishes a vascular inventory for treatment of diverse disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2146546664,"We found mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) to have a secretory protein profile distinct from other brain cells and to modulate microglial activation, proliferation and phagocytosis. NPC-derived vascular endothelial growth factor was necessary and sufficient to exert at least some of these effects in mice. Thus, neural precursor cells may not only be shaped by microglia, but also regulate microglia functions and activity."
https://openalex.org/W1991144297,"Adhesive contact between pre- and postsynaptic neurons initiates synapse formation during brain development and provides a natural means of transsynaptic signaling. Numerous adhesion molecules and their role during synapse development have been described in detail. However, once established, the mechanisms of adhesive disassembly and its function in regulating synaptic transmission have been unclear. Here, we report that synaptic activity induces acute proteolytic cleavage of neuroligin-1 (NLG1), a postsynaptic adhesion molecule at glutamatergic synapses. NLG1 cleavage is triggered by NMDA receptor activation, requires Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and is mediated by proteolytic activity of matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9). Cleavage of NLG1 occurs at single activated spines, is regulated by neural activity in vivo, and causes rapid destabilization of its presynaptic partner neurexin-1β (NRX1β). In turn, NLG1 cleavage depresses synaptic transmission by abruptly reducing presynaptic release probability. Thus, local proteolytic control of synaptic adhesion tunes synaptic transmission during brain development and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1998450044,"Though the early integration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into tumor-associated stroma of cancer has been demonstrated, the functional contributions and underlying mechanisms of these cells to tumor growth and angiogenesis remain to be clarified. Using a xenograft model, human colorectal cancer cells, MSCs, and their cell mixture were introduced to a subcutaneous site of immunodeficient mice. The tumor growth rate and angiogenesis of each transplantation was then compared. We demonstrate that a variety of colorectal cancer cells, when mixed with otherwise non-tumorigenic MSCs, increase the tumor growth rate and angiogenesis more than that when mixed with carcinoma-associated fibroblasts or normal colonic fibroblasts. The secretion of interleukin-6 (IL-6) from MSCs increases the secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) in cancer cells, which induces the activation of Akt and ERK in endothelial cells, thereby enhancing their capacities for recruitment and angiogenesis to tumor. The IL-6/ET-1/Akt or ERK pathway of tumor-stroma interaction can be targeted by an antibody against IL-6 or Lentiviral-mediated RNAi against IL-6 in MSCs, by inhibition or knockdown of ET-1 in cancer cells, or by inhibition of ERK and Akt in host endothelial cells. These demonstrate that attempts to interrupt the interaction of MSCs and cancer cells help to abrogate angiogenesis and inhibit tumor growth in tumors formed by cancer cells admixed with MSCs. These data demonstrate that the tumor microenvironment, namely, MSCs-secreted IL-6, may enrich the proangiognic factors secreted by cancer cells to increase angiogenesis and tumor growth and that targeting this interaction may lead to novel therapeutic and preventive strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2052405748,"The ability to group stimuli into perceptual categories is essential for efficient interaction with the environment. Discrete dynamics that emerge in brain networks are believed to be the neuronal correlate of category formation. Observations of such dynamics have recently been made; however, it is still unresolved if they actually match perceptual categories. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of mice, we show that local network activity evoked by sounds is constrained to few response modes. Transitions between response modes are characterized by an abrupt switch, indicating attractor-like, discrete dynamics. Moreover, we show that local cortical responses quantitatively predict discrimination performance and spontaneous categorization of sounds in behaving mice. Our results therefore demonstrate that local nonlinear dynamics in the auditory cortex generate spontaneous sound categories which can be selected for behavioral or perceptual decisions.

Local auditory cortex populations represent sounds in a few discrete response modes Transitions between local modes are highly nonlinear Sounds are efficiently encoded by the combination of several local modes Discrete response modes are predictive of sound categorization in mice Much of the work on the auditory cortex (AC) has been focused on the analysis of single neuron receptive fields—testing the idea that cortical neurons function as an array of linear filters that decompose sounds in a similar way to the spectrograms used for graphical sound representation. However, recent studies have accumulated evidence that single neurons do not behave as true linear filters (Christianson et al., 2008Christianson G.B. Sahani M. Linden J.F.

Specifically, measures of the linear response characteristics of single neurons to sound (e.g., tuning curve, spectrotemporal receptive field) show that neuronal responses depend on the intensity, the sequence (Christianson et al., 2011Christianson G.B.

Starting from the theoretical work of J. Hopfield on attractors in recurrent neuronal networks (Hopfield, 1982Hopfield J.J. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1982; 79: 2554-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (12061) Google Scholar), modeling studies suggested that cortical-like network architectures are prone to generate highly nonlinear population dynamics (Amit and Brunel, 1997Amit D.J.

Cortex. 1997; 7: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar; Maass et al., 2007Maass W. Joshi P. Sontag E.D. Computational aspects of feedback in neural circuits.PLoS Comput.

Decision making in recurrent neuronal circuits.Neuron. 2008; 60: 215-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This highly nonlinear population dynamic could explain the shortcomings of the linear filter model as recently suggested in a model of the AC (Loebel et al., 2007Loebel A. Nelken I. Tsodyks M. Processing of sounds by population spikes in a model of primary auditory cortex.Front. Neurosci. 2007; 1: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Importantly, the all-or-none properties of nonlinear population dynamics could serve as a basis for encoding the perceptual categories, or objects, which are essential for efficient and robust interaction with the environment (Miller et al., 2003Miller E.K. Nieder A. Freedman D.J. Wallis J.D. Neural correlates of categories and concepts.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar; Russ et al., 2007Russ B.E.

Category learning in the brain.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 33: 203-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by recent experiments in the rat hippocampus and the zebrafish olfactory bulb reporting abrupt transitions in the neuronal representation of continuously changing olfactory stimuli or spatial environments (Niessing and Friedrich, 2010Niessing J. Friedrich R.W. Olfactory pattern classification by discrete neuronal network states.Nature. 2010; 465: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar; Wills et al., 2005Wills T.J. Lever C. Cacucci F. Burgess N. O’Keefe J. Attractor dynamics in the hippocampal representation of the local environment.Science. 2005; 308: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it remains unclear how far these discrete network dynamics actually reflect perceptual categories since the experimental designs did not involve any perceptual judgment of the stimuli. Here, we investigated whether nonlinear representations of sounds exist in the mouse auditory cortex at the network level and whether they could form a basis for sound categorization, which has been proposed to be a major function of the AC (Nelken et al., 2003Nelken I.

Neural and behavioral correlates of auditory categorization.Hear. Res. 2007; 229: 204-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To monitor network activity in the auditory cortex of the mouse with single cell resolution, we used two-photon calcium imaging, a technique which gives the possibility to simultaneously record the activity of a large number of neurons in vivo (Garaschuk et al., 2006Garaschuk O. Milos R.I. Konnerth A. Targeted bulk-loading of fluorescent indicators for two-photon brain imaging in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We injected isoflurane anaesthetized mice (1%) with the calcium-sensitive dye Oregon Green Bapta 1 AM (OGB1) in the region functionally identified as the AC using intrinsic imaging recordings (Figures 1A and 1B ; Kalatsky et al., 2005Kalatsky V.A. Polley D.B. Merzenich M.M. Schreiner C.E. Stryker M.P. Fine functional organization of auditory cortex revealed by Fourier optical imaging.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 13325-13330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Neurons labeled with OGB1 were imaged using two-photon microscopy in single focal planes at a depth of ∼150–300 μm below the pia in cortical layers II/III (Figure 1C). The typical field of view was a 200 μm square, in which calcium signals from 46–99 individual neurons were recorded using line scans (Figures 1C and 1D). To estimate the neuronal firing rate based on OGB1 fluorescence measurements, we performed loose-patch recordings of individual OGB1 loaded neurons in vivo. The electrically recorded neuron was simultaneously imaged together with its neighbors using our typical line scan settings (Figures 1E and 1F). Consistently with a previous report (Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006Yaksi E. Friedrich R.W. Reconstruction of firing rate changes across neuronal populations by temporally deconvolved Ca2+ imaging.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we observe that the temporal deconvolution of the raw calcium signals using an exponential kernel matched the time course of the neuron’s instantaneous firing rate (Figures 1G–1H, and see Figure S1 available online). An estimate of the absolute firing rate amplitude was obtained by linearly scaling the deconvolved signal to fit the actual firing rate. The average scaling factor corresponding to the change in fluorescence elicited by a single action potential across all recordings was 1.80% ± 0.44% (mean ± SD, n = 5). Typical spontaneous and sound evoked AC activity was dominated by short population events in which a large fraction of neurons fired synchronously (Figure 1I). This observation is in agreement with previous reports based on multisite or intracellular current recordings (DeWeese and Zador, 2006DeWeese M.R. Zador A.M. Non-Gaussian membrane potential dynamics imply sparse, synchronous activity in auditory cortex.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 12206-12218Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar; Luczak et al., 2009Luczak A. Barthó P. Harris K.D.

Harris K.D. Laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in auditory cortex.Neuron. 2009; 64: 404-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Additionally, it is consistent with the high noise correlations between neurons observed in previous calcium imaging studies (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2010Bandyopadhyay S. Shamma S.A. Kanold P.O. Dichotomy of functional organization in the mouse auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 361-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar; Rothschild et al., 2010Rothschild G. Nelken I. Mizrahi A. Functional organization and population dynamics in the mouse primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To evaluate qualitatively how different sounds might generate different types of local population events, we plotted single trial response vectors (∼15–20 trials per sound) obtained by averaging the activity for each neuron in a 250 ms time window following sound onset. An example of such plots for four distinct short pure tones (50 ms) at different sound levels is shown in Figure 2A. We observed that all studied populations had local response vectors that were highly variable from one trial to the other for a given sound. This variability was due to large trial-to-trial variations in the response of most individual neurons (Bartho et al., 2009Bartho P. Curto C. Luczak A. Marguet S.L. Harris K.D. Population coding of tone stimuli in auditory cortex: dynamic rate vector analysis.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 30: 1767-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; Hromádka et al., 2008Hromádka T. Deweese M.R. Zador A.M. Sparse representation of sounds in the unanesthetized auditory cortex.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e16Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Despite the variability, we were able to observe that sound intensity and identity modulated the probability of observing a population event. Tuning to pure tones could be seen at both the single neuron (Figures 2B–2D) and at the population level (Figure 2A). However, prediction of the population firing rate in response to complex sounds by a linear model based on the observed pure tone tuning was poor (Figure S2). Therefore, local populations encode sounds in a nonlinear fashion, as was reported for single neurons (Machens et al., 2004Machens C.K. Wehr M.S. Zador A.M. Linearity of cortical receptive fields measured with natural sounds.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1089-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This implies that pure tone tuning alone is not sufficient to describe sound representation in the auditory cortex. We therefore decided to use a more general framework to investigate the coding properties of local response patterns in single trials (Bathellier et al., 2008Bathellier B. Buhl D.L. Accolla R. Carleton A. Dynamic ensemble odor coding in the mammalian olfactory bulb: sensory information at different timescales.Neuron. 2008; 57: 586-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In most local populations, we made the striking observation that despite the high variability of response patterns, the most reliable part of the pattern seemed to be common to very different sounds such as the different pure tones shown in Figure 2A. This suggested to us that sound evoked responses in local auditory cortex networks are constrained to a limited repertoire of functional patterns superposed on high trial-to-trial stochasticity. To obtain a quantitative account of the limited repertoire of functional patterns in the face of large variability, we systematically quantified the similarity of local response patterns elicited by large arrays of short (50–70 ms) pure tones and complex sounds. To do so, we used a similarity metric designed to obtain an intuitive readout of single trial response separability. In short, the similarity between two sound-evoked responses was defined as the average of all pairwise correlations between the single trial response patterns of the two sounds (see matrices of single trial correlations, Figure 3A). This similarity metric was compared to a response reliability metric, which was the average of all pairwise correlations between all the single trial response patterns of one given sound. This reliability metric gave us a quantitative readout of the trial-to-trial variability in response to a given sound. Using these two metrics, the idea is that if the response patterns to two sounds have a lower similarity than their respective reliabilities, they will likely be discriminable on a single trial basis by an external observer. If not, the patterns can be thought to be the same. Pairwise response similarities were displayed in color-coded matrix plots after ordering the sounds with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to reveal potential underlying structures in the space of response patterns (Figures 3B and 3C). In line with the qualitative observations of high stochasticity (see Figure 2A), we observed that response pattern reliability was generally low. The largest response reliability observed in a population was ranging from 0.62 to 0.02 in unresponsive populations (average: 0.29 ± 0.14 SD, n = 124 local populations, see also Figures 3B and 3C). Despite this high variability, the observed reliability levels were clearly higher than for randomized data sets (Figure S3) demonstrating that specific activity patterns in local populations were indeed present. In a given population, the reliability values formed a continuum between sounds evoking a rather strong response and sounds evoking no response reflecting variations in response probability qualitatively observed in Figure 2A. When we considered the similarity of responses elicited by different sounds, we observed in the majority of local populations that all reliable responses were highly similar to each other, as indicated by similarity values of the same level as the reliability values (e.g., Figure 3B). In these cases, only a single cluster of sound responses was apparent in the similarity matrix, suggesting that a single type of functional response pattern, or response mode, could be generated in these populations. Interestingly, we also found local populations in which two (Figure 3C) or three clusters of sound responses could be visually identified, indicated by similarity values across the clusters that were much lower than the reliability and intra-cluster similarity values. We wondered if the presence of only few response patterns may be due the network state induced by the anesthetic. To address this issue we performed a series of experiments in awake, passively listening mice (see Experimental Procedures). We observed that brief sounds evoked population responses in a burst-like manner (Figures 3D and 3E). When constructing clustered similarity matrixes from the response vectors, we observed only a few response modes, similar to the anaesthetized mice (Figures 3F and 3G). To quantitatively assess the number of sound clusters that could be generated, we developed a statistical test that evaluates the probability that the N first major clusters could arise from the randomness of single trial response patterns and the low number of individual sound repetitions rather than reflecting true sound clusters (see Figure S3 and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details on the implementation). With this test, we could evaluate the maximum number of clusters which gave a statistically significant explanation of the distribution of sound response patterns in a given population. This test was run for 67 populations in which at least two sounds generated response patterns with a reliability level above 0.2. In 74.6% of these populations, the data was best explained by a single response mode, while two or three response modes were detected in 20.9% and 4.5% of the respective populations (Figures 4A and 4B ). The same analysis performed on the data from awake, passively listening mice revealed a similar distribution (Figure 4C). This analysis demonstrated that, despite the large number of theoretical response modes that groups of several tens of neurons could generate, local auditory cortex populations generate only a small repertoire of functionally distinct response modes. Interestingly, a similar result was obtained when two second long sounds were presented (Figure S4). We then sought to determine the spatial organization of the neurons that underlie distinct response modes. We calculated the mean firing rate of neurons in response to the groups of sounds associated to the different modes, which were identified in the above analysis. Interestingly, pairs of response modes observed in a given population corresponded to the firing of partially overlapping subgroups of neurons (Figures 4A and 4D). To assess the similarity of tuning of neurons associated to the same or different subgroups, we computed their signal correlations. We found that members of the same subgroup had significantly higher signal correlations than neuron pairs across groups (same mode: 0.76 ± 0.07, n = 37; different modes: 0.53 ± 0.11, n = 23 modes, Wilcoxon test p = 2 × 10−4). Furthermore, the centroids of the neuronal subgroups corresponding to two distinct response modes were significantly more distant to each other than when the neurons of the local population are spatially randomized (Figure 4E). This indicated an organization of the modes into different spatial domains, which was also visually evident in many examples (Figures 4A and 3C). This observation is consistent with previous estimations of the spatial layout of neurons suggesting a patchy organization of neuronal subgroups in the cortex (Rothschild et al., 2010Rothschild G. Nelken I. Mizrahi A. Functional organization and population dynamics in the mouse primary auditory cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The low number of observed response modes suggests that local activity patterns form discrete representations of sounds. A prediction from this scenario would be that for a continuous transition between two stimuli exciting two modes an abrupt change in response patterns would be observed because the population could generate no intermediate response pattern. Alternatively, the low number of response modes could merely reflect biases or gaps in the set of tested sounds. To determine if abrupt changes in response patterns could be observed, we first identified local populations in anaesthetized mice showing at least two response modes using a broad set of different sounds (Figure 5A). We selected two basis sounds that were falling in either response mode and constructed linear mixtures from them. Next, we retested the same population with the new set of stimuli to map the transition across modes with higher resolution. When the mixture ratio was varied continuously, we observed abrupt transitions in the population activity patterns that are visible in both the raw activity plots and the similarity matrices (Figures 5B, 5C, and S5). In addition to the abrupt switch in the structure of the activity patterns, we often observed a decrease in the reliability of one of the response mode close to the actual transition (Figures 5B and 5C). It is noteworthy, that this decrease in reliability can give the impression of a smooth mode transition without a change of the underlying pattern as such. Importantly, in none of the experiments we observed the emergence of a new activity pattern after retesting with a new stimulus set, corroborating the finding of a strong constraint on response modes that are allowed in the network. To further verify the abrupt change in response pattern we wanted to more carefully assess whether at any point in the linear mixtures both modes might be simultaneously present. Toward this end, we performed the following analysis: we computed the optimal linear decomposition R→=∑i=12αim→i+r→ over the template patterns m→1 and m→2 of the two modes for each single trial response pattern R→ of the sound mixtures. The templates were computed as the average response pattern to each of the two basis sounds, excluding responses to the mixtures. The decomposition was obtained using a standard least square linear fitting algorithm (Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse method) minimizing the norm of the residual pattern r→. In this framework, the coefficients α1 and α2 represent the strength of the contribution of each mode in a given single trial response pattern. When we plotted α1 against α2 for every single trial response pattern of a given local population (Figure 5D) or for all local populations tested (n = 9; Figure 5E), it became clearly apparent that the two modes did not coexist along the transition. This was indicated by the fact that we did not observe high coefficients for both modes in the very large majority of response patterns. We also observed that the average coefficients α1 and α2 were never both much larger than zero for any given sound mixture (Figures 5D–5F). Instead, a clear transition was observed at a certain mixture ratio where the value of at least one of the two coefficients dropped abruptly while the other increased (Figure 5F). To quantify the abruptness of the transition the values of α1 and α2 for different mixture ratios where fitted with a sigmoidal function from which we derived the slope at the transition. In all populations tested with linear mixtures of sounds, we observed highly nonlinear transitions, indicated by a maximum slope much larger than 1 for at least one of the modes (n = 9; Figure 5G). When fitting slopes to the average coefficients, it should be kept in mind that a possible modulation of the reliability to elicit a given response patterns with changing mixture ratios can lead to a smoothing of the curve despite the fact that the switch in the structure of the pattern as such is abrupt. An abrupt switch in response patterns could result from a fast loss of efficiency to evoke the response pattern by the respective component of the mixture. Alternatively, the switch could result from a competition of the two response patterns. In the first scenario, the efficacy to elicit a response pattern would be independent of the presence of the second component, whereas in the second scenario the switch would be defined by the specific ratio of the two components making up the mixture. To test this hypothesis, we again identified local populations generating two response modes (n = 5, in 2 mice) and selected two basis sounds exciting each of the modes. We synthesized mixtures of the two basis sounds with seven equally spaced mixture ratios and the individual mixture components in isolation (i.e., one of the basis sounds faded to silence). We compared the patterns of response to the isolated components and to the mixtures and computed the corresponding clustered similarity matrices (Figures 5H and S5). The sound level at which the transition occurred depended on the specific sound and the local population. Importantly, in all cases we found sound levels where both components of the mixture in isolation elicited a reliable response. However, when both components are presented at the same time one of the two response modes appeared to be dominant and only one of the patterns was excited (Figure 5H). Hence, instead of an additive response, the local network falls in a highly nonlinear manner in either one of the two response modes. This indicates that the choice of one mode or the other is a winner-take-all decision, which may result from competitive interactions between neuronal populations. Our observations show that local populations of the auditory cortex are constrained to few response modes which encode a small number of sound categories enclosing several sounds. This implies that local populations are highly limited in their capacity to discriminate a large number of sounds. Yet at the level of the organism, sound discrimination does not show such constraints. How this apparent paradox could be resolved became evident when we probed various local populations within and across mice in several primary auditory fields (Figure 6A). In each case, the different local populations categorized different sets of sounds, suggesting that different local populations provide complementary information to unambiguously encode a large number of sounds. To quantitatively assess this observation, we plotted response similarity matrices for a selection of 15 clearly distinct sounds (excluding mixtures and different sound levels; Figure 6B), in which the sound order is fixed (i.e., no clustering was performed; Figure 6C, top). In these plots, the sounds giving rise to a reliable response or being grouped in different modes differ from one population to the next. Thus, different populations are discriminating different sets of sounds. When we built the same similarity matrix for a global AC population using concatenated single-trial population vectors from 74 local populations recorded in 14 anaesthetized mice (total of 4,734 neurons), most of the 15 selected sounds have a higher reliability (diagonal) than their similarity to other sounds (Figure 6D). This indicates that each of the individual sounds can be better discriminated by the global population combining information from multiple local populations. To precisely quantify general sound discrimination efficiency by local and global populations, we computed the fraction of all possible sound pairs (1,770 pairs from a set of 60 sounds including mixtures and different sound levels) that could be correctly distinguished by a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier on the basis of single trial population vectors (Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2000Shawe-Taylor J.

Here we report that neuroligin-1 (NLG1) undergoes ectodomain shedding at the juxtamembrane stalk region to generate a secreted form of NLG1 and a membrane-tethered C-terminal fragment (CTF) in adult rat brains in vivo as well as in neuronal cultures. Pharmacological and genetic studies identified ADAM10 as the major protease responsible for NLG1 shedding, the latter being augmented by synaptic NMDA receptor activation or interaction with soluble neurexin ligands. NLG1-CTF was subsequently cleaved by presenilin/γ-secretase. Secretion of soluble NLG1 was significantly upregulated under a prolonged epileptic seizure condition, and inhibition of NLG1 shedding led to an increase in numbers of dendritic spines in neuronal cultures. Collectively, neuronal activity-dependent proteolytic processing of NLG1 may negatively regulate the remodeling of spines at excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2142358502,"Under endoplasmic reticulum stress, unfolded protein accumulation leads to activation of the endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane kinase/endoRNase (RNase) IRE1α. IRE1α oligomerizes, autophosphorylates and initiates splicing of XBP1 mRNA, thus triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here we show that IRE1α's kinase-controlled RNase can be regulated in two distinct modes with kinase inhibitors: one class of ligands occupies IRE1α's kinase ATP-binding site to activate RNase-mediated XBP1 mRNA splicing even without upstream endoplasmic reticulum stress, whereas a second class can inhibit the RNase through the same ATP-binding site, even under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, alternative kinase conformations stabilized by distinct classes of ATP-competitive inhibitors can cause allosteric switching of IRE1α's RNase--either on or off. As dysregulation of the UPR has been implicated in a variety of cell degenerative and neoplastic disorders, small-molecule control over IRE1α should advance efforts to understand the UPR's role in pathophysiology and to develop drugs for endoplasmic reticulum stress-related diseases."

We used genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing in primary human CD4+ T cells to reveal that BRD4 co-localizes with Ser-2-phosphorylated Pol II (Pol II Ser-2) at both enhancers and promoters of active genes. Disruption of bromodomain-histone acetylation interactions by JQ1, a small-molecule bromodomain inhibitor, resulted in decreased BRD4 binding, reduced Pol II Ser-2, and reduced expression of lineage-specific genes in primary human CD4+ T cells. A large number of JQ1-disrupted BRD4 binding regions exhibited diacetylated H4 (lysine 5 and -8) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac), which correlated with the presence of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases. Genes associated with BRD4/H3K27ac co-occupancy exhibited significantly higher activity than those associated with H3K27ac or BRD4 binding alone. Comparison of BRD4 binding in T cells and in human embryonic stem cells revealed that enhancer BRD4 binding sites were predominantly lineage-specific. Our findings suggest that BRD4-driven Pol II phosphorylation at serine 2 plays an important role in regulating lineage-specific gene transcription in human CD4+ T cells."

Citrate is an important metabolite that serves as the starting material for the biosynthesis of fatty acids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. The cytosolic concentration of citrate depends in part on direct import across the plasma membrane through the Na+-dependent citrate transporter, a member of the divalent anion/Na+ symporter family. In this paper, the authors report the X-ray crystal structure and transport-activity studies of a bacterial Na+-dependent citrate transporter. The structural and biochemical studies suggest how specific conformational changes facilitate substrate translocation across the cell membrane. In human cells, cytosolic citrate is a chief precursor for the synthesis of fatty acids, triacylglycerols, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Cytosolic citrate further regulates the energy balance of the cell by activating the fatty-acid-synthesis pathway while downregulating both the glycolysis and fatty-acid β-oxidation pathways1,2,3,4. The rate of fatty-acid synthesis in liver and adipose cells, the two main tissue types for such synthesis, correlates directly with the concentration of citrate in the cytosol2,3,4,5, with the cytosolic citrate concentration partially depending on direct import across the plasma membrane through the Na+-dependent citrate transporter (NaCT)6,7. Mutations of the homologous fly gene (Indy; I’m not dead yet) result in reduced fat storage through calorie restriction8. More recently, Nact (also known as Slc13a5)-knockout mice have been found to have increased hepatic mitochondrial biogenesis, higher lipid oxidation and energy expenditure, and reduced lipogenesis, which taken together protect the mice from obesity and insulin resistance9. To understand the transport mechanism of NaCT and INDY proteins, here we report the 3.2 Å crystal structure of a bacterial INDY homologue. One citrate molecule and one sodium ion are bound per protein, and their binding sites are defined by conserved amino acid motifs, forming the structural basis for understanding the specificity of the transporter. Comparison of the structures of the two symmetrical halves of the transporter suggests conformational changes that propel substrate translocation."

Mitotic recombination events resulting in extended loss of heterozygosity were not observed in DS iPSCs. The derived, disomic cells proliferated faster and produced more endothelia in vivo than their otherwise isogenic trisomic counterparts, but in vitro hematopoietic differentiation was not consistently altered. Our study describes a targeted removal of a human trisomy, which could prove useful in both clinical and research applications."
https://openalex.org/W2000481222,"NANOG is a stem cell transcription factor that is essential for embryonic development, reprogramming normal adult cells and malignant transformation and progression. The nearly identical retrogene NANOGP8 is expressed in multiple cancers, but generally not in normal tissues and its function is not well defined. Our postulate is that NANOGP8 directly modulates the stemness of individual human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells. Stemness was measured in vitro as the spherogenicity of single CRC cells in serum-free medium and the size of the side population (SP) and in vivo as tumorigenicity and experimental metastatic potential in NOD/SCID mice. We found that 80% of clinical liver metastases express a NANOG with 75% of the positive metastases containing NANOGP8 transcripts. In all, 3–62% of single cells within six CRC lines form spheroids in serum-free medium in suspension. NANOGP8 is translated into protein. The relative expression of a NANOG gene increased 8- to 122-fold during spheroid formation, more than the increase in OCT4 or SOX2 transcripts with NANOGP8 the more prevalent family member. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) to NANOG not only inhibits spherogenicity but also reduces expression of OCT4 and SOX2, the size of the SP and tumor growth in vivo. Inhibition of NANOG gene expression is associated with inhibition of proliferation and decreased phosphorylation of G2-related cell-cycle proteins. Overexpression of NANOGP8 rescues single-cell spherogenicity when NANOG gene expression is inhibited and increases the SP in CRC. Thus, NANOGP8 can substitute for NANOG in directly promoting stemness in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2060917827,"GRP78, a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone and signaling regulator, is commonly overexpressed in cancer. Moreover, induction of GRP78 by a variety of anti-cancer drugs, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, confers chemoresistance to cancer, thereby contributing to tumorigenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at decreasing GRP78 levels, which results in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and resensitization of tumor cells to chemotherapeutic drugs may hold promise for cancer treatment. Despite advances in our understanding of GRP78 actions, little is known about endogenous inhibitors controlling its expression. As endogenous regulators, microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in modulating gene expression; therefore, we sought to identify miRNA(s) that target GRP78, under the hypothesis that these miRNAs may serve as therapeutic agents. Here, we report that three miRNAs (miR-30d, miR-181a, miR-199a-5p) predicted to target GRP78 are down-regulated in prostate, colon and bladder tumors, and human cancer cell lines. We show that in C42B prostate cancer cells, these miRNAs down-regulate GRP78 and induce apoptosis by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region. Importantly, we demonstrate that the three miRNAs act cooperatively to decrease GRP78 levels, suggesting that multiple miRNAs may be required to efficiently control the expression of some genes. In addition, delivery of multiple miRNAs by either transient transfection or lentivirus transduction increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, in C42B, HCT116 and HL-60 cells. Together, our results indicate that the delivery of co-transcribed miRNAs can efficiently suppress GRP78 levels and GRP78-mediated chemoresistance, and suggest that this strategy holds therapeutic potential."

However, PHD activity also depends on factors other than oxygen, especially αKG, a key metabolic compound closely linked to amino-acid metabolism. We examined the connection between amino-acid availability and PHD activity. We found that amino-acid starvation leads to αKG depletion and to PHD inactivation but not to HIF stabilization. Furthermore, pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PHDs induced autophagy and prevented mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation by amino acids in a HIF-independent manner. Therefore, PHDs sense not only oxygen but also respond to amino acids, constituting a broad intracellular nutrient-sensing network."

Here we report that promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF), the BTB-zinc finger (BTB-ZF) transcription factor directing the innate-like effector program of natural killer T-cell thymocytes, is prominently associated with cullin 3 (CUL3), an E3 ubiquitin ligase previously shown to use BTB domain-containing proteins as adaptors for substrate binding. PLZF transports CUL3 to the nucleus, where the two proteins are associated within a chromatin-modifying complex. Furthermore, PLZF expression results in selective ubiquitination changes of several components of this complex. CUL3 was also found associated with the BTB-ZF transcription factor BCL6, which directs the germinal-centre B cell and follicular T-helper cell programs. Conditional CUL3 deletion in mice demonstrated an essential role for CUL3 in the development of PLZF- and BCL6-dependent lineages. We conclude that distinct lineage-specific BTB-ZF transcription factors recruit CUL3 to alter the ubiquitination pattern of their associated chromatin-modifying complex. We propose that this new function is essential to direct the differentiation of several T- and B-cell effector programs, and may also be involved in the oncogenic role of PLZF and BCL6 in leukaemias and lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2086962237,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a byproduct of cellular metabolism, damage intracellular macromolecules and, when present in excess, can promote normal hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and exhaustion. However, mechanisms that regulate the amount of ROS in leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) and the biological role of ROS in these cells are largely unknown. We show here that the ROS(low) subset of CD44(+) cells in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a malignancy of immature T cell progenitors, is highly enriched in the most aggressive LICs and that ROS accumulation is restrained by downregulation of protein kinase C θ (PKC-θ). Notably, primary mouse T-ALLs lacking PKC-θ show improved LIC activity, whereas enforced PKC-θ expression in both mouse and human primary T-ALLs compromised LIC activity. We also show that PKC-θ is regulated by a new pathway in which NOTCH1 induces runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), RUNX3 represses RUNX1 and RUNX1 induces PKC-θ. NOTCH1, which is frequently activated by mutation in T-ALL and required for LIC activity in both mouse and human models, thus acts to repress PKC-θ. These results reveal key functional roles for PKC-θ and ROS in T-ALL and suggest that aggressive biological behavior in vivo could be limited by therapeutic strategies that promote PKC-θ expression or activity, or the accumulation of ROS."

We explored in the salamander retina how signals from individual bipolar cells feed into multiple ganglion cells and found that each bipolar cell was able to evoke distinct responses among ganglion cells, differing in kinetics, adaptation and rectification properties. This signal divergence resulted primarily from interactions with amacrine cells that allowed each bipolar cell to send distinct signals to its target ganglion cells. Our findings indicate that individual bipolar cell-ganglion cell connections have distinct transfer functions. This expands the number of visual channels in the inner retina and enhances the computational power and feature selectivity of early visual processing."

Although agonist treatment generally does not affect transcription of mor, previous studies suggest that morphine can affect the translation efficiency of MOR transcript via microRNAs (miRNAs). On the basis of miRNA microarray analyses of the hippocampal total RNA isolated from mice chronically treated with μ-opioid agonists, we found a miRNA (miR-339-3p) that was consistently and specifically increased by morphine (2-fold) and by fentanyl (3.8-fold). miR-339-3p bound to the MOR 3′-UTR and specifically suppressed reporter activity. Suppression was blunted by adding miR-339-3p inhibitor or mutating the miR-339-3p target site. In cells endogenously expressing MOR, miR-339-3p inhibited the production of MOR protein by destabilizing MOR mRNA. Up-regulation of miR-339-3p by fentanyl (EC50=0.75 nM) resulted from an increase in primary miRNA transcript. Mapping of the miR-339-3p primary RNA and its promoter revealed that the primary miR-339-3p was embedded in a noncoding 3′-UTR region of an unknown host gene and was coregulated by the host promoter. The identified promoter was activated by opioid agonist treatment (10 nM fentanyl or 10 μM morphine), a specific effect blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone (10 μM).

We hypothesize that inappropriate glutamatergic signaling in other cell types can dysregulate growth leading to transformation and tumorigenesis. As most cancers are carcinomas, we selected an immortalized primary baby mouse kidney (iBMK) cell model to assess whether Grm1 can transform epithelial cells. These iBMK cells, engineered to be immortal yet nontumorigenic and retaining normal epithelial characteristics, were used as recipients for exogenous Grm1 cDNA. Several stable Grm1-expressing clones were isolated and the Grm1-receptors were shown to be functional, as evidenced by the accumulation of second messengers in response to Grm1 agonist. Additionally activated by agonist were mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT/protein kinase B signaling cascades, the major intracellular pathways shown by many investigators to be critical in melanomagenesis and other neoplasms. These Grm1-iBMK cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation in in vitro methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and significant tumorigenicity in in vivo allografts. Persistent Grm1 expression was required for the maintenance of the in vivo tumorigenic phenotype as demonstrated by an inducible Grm1-silencing RNA. These are the first results that indicate that Grm1 can be an oncogene in epithelial cells. In addition, relevance to human disease in the corresponding tumor type of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may be suggested by observed expression of GRM1/mGluR1 in a number of RCC tumor biopsy samples and cell lines, and the effects of GRM1 modulation on tumorigenicity therein. Moreover, RCC cell lines exhibited elevated levels of extracellular glutamate, and some lines responded to drugs, which modulate the glutamatergic system. These findings imply a possible role for glutamate signaling apparatus in RCC cell growth, and that the glutamatergic system may be a therapeutic target in RCC."

The reference treatments for MDS include the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors azacytidine and decitabine. Recently, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib has been shown to exert antileukemic activity in vitro and in vivo, independent of the EGFR. Thanks to this feature, erlotinib is currently being tested as an antileukemic drug in clinical trials. Here, we report that azacytidine and erlotinib mediate synergistic antineoplastic effects in several primary or secondary (post-MDS) AML cell lines. The combination of azacytidine and erlotinib blocked cell-cycle progression and induced caspase-dependent apoptosis more consistently than either of the two agents alone. These effects were not a consequence of cellular differentiation and could be discriminated from each other, as the former depended on caspases whereas the latter did not. The synergy between azacitidine and erlotinib, which involved the proteasomal degradation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members MCL-1 and BCL2L10 and the upregulation of their pro-apoptotic counterpart PUMA, was abolished when azacytidine was replaced by decitabine but persisted when erlotinib was substituted with gefitinib, another EGFR inhibitor. Of note, the intracellular accumulation of azacytidine was exacerbated by both erlotinib and gefitinib, pointing to a pharmacokinetic mechanism of synergy. In approximately half of the cases studied, marrow and circulating blasts from MDS and AML patients, respectively, exhibited hyperadditive cytotoxic responses to the combination of azacytidine and erlotinib. These results strongly suggest that the combination of azacytidine and erlotinib may exert clinically relevant antileukemic effects."
https://openalex.org/W1984984249,"Tumor cells adaptation to severe oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) plays a major role in tumor progression. The transcription factor HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1), whose α-subunit is stabilized under hypoxic conditions is a key component of this process. Recent studies showed that two members of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) family, ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and DNA-PK (DNA-dependent protein kinase), regulate the hypoxic-dependent accumulation of HIF-1. These proteins initiate cellular stress responses when DNA damage occurs. In addition, it has been demonstrated that extreme hypoxia induces a replicative stress resulting in regions of single-stranded DNA at stalled replication forks and the activation of ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein), another member of the PIKKs family. Here, we show that even less severe hypoxia (0.1% O2) also induces activation of ATR through replicative stress. Importantly, in using either transiently silenced ATR cells, cells expressing an inactive form of ATR or cells exposed to an ATR inhibitor (CGK733), we demonstrate that hypoxic ATR activation positively regulates the key transcription factor HIF-1 independently of the checkpoint kinase Chk1. We show that ATR kinase activity regulates HIF-1α at the translational level and we find that the elements necessary for the regulation of HIF-1α translation are located within the coding region of HIF-1α mRNA. Finally, by using three independent cellular models, we clearly show that the loss of ATR expression and/or kinase activity results in the decrease of HIF-1 DNA binding under hypoxia and consequently affects protein expression levels of two HIF-1 target genes, GLUT-1 and CAIX. Taken together, our data show a new function for ATR in cellular adaptation to hypoxia through regulation of HIF-1α translation. Our work offers new prospect for cancer therapy using ATR inhibitors with the potential to decrease cellular adaptation in hypoxic tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2091683380,"KLF6, a ubiquitously expressed Krüppel-like transcription factor, is frequently inactivated in human cancer and has significant roles in cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and development. A key mechanism of KLF6-mediated growth suppression is through p53-independent transactivation of p21. Several cancer-derived KLF6 mutants lead to the loss of p21-mediated growth suppression through an unknown mechanism. Because several colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma-derived KLF6 mutations affect a glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) phosphorylation consensus site, we investigated the role of GSK3β in the regulation of KLF6 function. Based on transient transfection, GSK3β augments the transactivation of a p21 promoter luciferase by KLF6. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of hemagglutinin (HA)-GSK3β and Flag-KLF6 validated the interaction between these two proteins. KLF6 phosphorylation is augmented in the presence of GSK3β based on in vitro and in vivo 32P incorporation assays. Site-directed mutagenesis of the candidate phosphorylation sites to alanines (‘KLF6-4A’ phosphomutant) eliminated a higher molecular weight phosphorylated isoform of KLF6 based on western blot. GSK3β augmented the transactivation by wild-type KLF6, but not KLF6-4A, towards the p21 promoter, and increased p21 protein. Functionally, GSK3β enhanced KLF6-mediated growth suppression, which was abrogated by the KLF6-4A phosphomutant. These data establish that GSK3β directly phosphorylates KLF6, which augments its induction of p21 and resultant growth suppression. This interaction may account for the growth-promoting effects of cancer-derived KLF6 mutants that lack tumor suppressor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2145517693,"Recent experimental data indicating axonal regeneration, axogenesis, dendritogenesis, and ciliary axoneme assembly and wellness have linked the role of cytosolic metallocarboxypeptidase 1 (CCP1/AGTPBP1/Nna1) to the microtubule network. In addition, 5 of the 6 mammalian ccp genes have been shown to participate in post-translational modifications of tubulin, which occur in the microtubules of neurons, mitotic spindles, cilia, and basal bodies. Here, we compile evidence for the idea that the occurrence of CCPs strongly correlates with the presence of cilia, suggesting that CCP functions might be primarily related to cilia and basal bodies (CBBs). In agreement with this hypothesis, CCPs were localized in centrioles, basal bodies, and mitotic spindles in HeLa cells by confocal microscopy. By reconstructing the evolutionary history of CCPs, we show their presence in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and relate each group of CCP orthologs to specific roles in CBBs. The clues presented in this study suggest that during the evolution of eukaryotes, mechanisms mediated by CCPs through tubulin post-translational modifications controlling assembly, trafficking, and signaling in the microtubules, were transferred from cilia to cell and axon microtubules.—Rodríguez de la Vega Otazo, M., Lorenzo, J., Tort, O., Avilés, F.

https://openalex.org/W2102193460,"During wound repair, epidermal cells at the edge of an injury establish front-rear polarity through orchestrated changes in their cytoskeleton and adhesion structures. The polarity and directed migration of such cells is determined by the assembly, extension, and stabilization of a lamellipodium. Actinin-4 associates with lamellipodia and has been implicated in regulating lamellipodial structure, function and assembly. To study the functions of actinin-4 in human keratinocytes, we used shRNA to generate knockdown cells and compared their motility behavior and matrix adhesion assembly to scrambled shRNA treated control keratinocytes. Actinin-4 knockdown keratinocytes lack polarity, assemble multiple lamellipodia with a 2× increased area over controls, display reduced activity of the actin remodeling protein cofilin, and fail to migrate in a directional manner. This motility defect is rescued by plating knockdown cells on preformed laminin-332 matrix. In actinin-4-knockdown keratinocytes, focal contact area is increased by 25%, and hemidesmosome proteins are mislocalized. Specifically, α6β4 integrin localizes to large lamellipodial extensions, displays reduced dynamics, and fails to recruit its bullous pemphigoid antigen binding partners. Together, our data indicate a role for actinin-4 in regulating the steering mechanism of keratinocytes via profound effects on their matrix adhesion sites.—Hamill, K. J., Hopkinson, S.

https://openalex.org/W2015536893,"Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. Homocysteine (Hcys) inhibits collagen cross-linking and consequently decreases bone extracellular matrix (ECM) quality. Serum amyloid A (A-SAA), an acute-phase protein family, plays an important role in chronic and inflammatory diseases and up-regulates MMP13, which plays an important role in bone development and remodeling. Here, we investigate the effect of Hcys on expression of SAA3, a member of the A-SAA gene family, in osteoblasts characterizing underlying mechanisms and possible consequences on bone metabolism. MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells were cultured up to 21 d with Hcys (low millimolar range) or reseeded onto ECM resulting from untreated or Hcys-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy and a discriminative antibody were used to characterize the resulting ECM. Gene expression and signaling pathways were analyzed by gene chip, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblotting. Transcriptional regulation of Saa3 was studied by promoter transfection assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Hcys treatment resulted in reduced collagen cross-linking, uncovering of RGD-motifs, and activation of the PTK2-PXN-CTNNB1 pathway followed by RELA activation. These signaling events led to increased SAA3 expression followed by the production of MMP13 and several chemokines, including Ccl5, Ccl2, Cxcl10, and Il6. Our data suggest Saa3 as link between hyperhomocysteinemia and development of osteoporosis.—Thaler, R., Zwerina, J., Rumpler, M., Spitzer, S., Gamsjaeger, S., Paschalis, E.

https://openalex.org/W2140362055,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a globally distributed hereditary red blood cell (RBC) disorder. One of the hallmarks of SCD is the presence of circulating dense RBCs, which are important in SCD-related clinical manifestations. In human dense sickle cells, we found reduced calpastatin activity and protein expression compared to either healthy RBCs or unfractionated sickle cells, suggesting an imbalance between activator and inhibitor of calpain-1 in favor of activator in dense sickle cells. Calpain-1 is a nonlysosomal cysteine proteinase that modulates multiple cell functions through the selective cleavage of proteins. To investigate the relevance of this observation in vivo, we evaluated the effects of the orally active inhibitor of calpain-1, BDA-410 (30 mg/kg/d), on RBCs from SAD mice, a mouse model for SCD. In SAD mice, BDA-410 improved RBC morphology, reduced RBC density (D20; from 1106±0.001 to 1100±0.001 g/ml; P<0.05) and increased RBC-K+ content (from 364±10 to 429±12.3 mmol/kg Hb; P<0.05), markedly reduced the activity of the Ca2+-activated K+channel (Gardos channel), and decreased membrane association of peroxiredoxin-2. The inhibitory effect of calphostin C, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC), on the Gardos channel was eliminated after BDA-410 treatment, which suggests that calpain-1 inhibition affects the PKC-dependent fraction of the Gardos channel. BDA-410 prevented hypoxia-induced RBC dehydration and K+ loss in SAD mice. These data suggest a potential role of BDA-410 as a novel therapeutic agent for treatment of SCD.—De Franceschi, L., Franco, R.

https://openalex.org/W2028740304,"Genetic changes in HER2, PTEN, PIK3CA and AKT1 are all common in breast cancer and lead to the elevated phosphorylation of downstream targets of the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Changes in HER2, PTEN, PIK3CA and AKT have all been reported to lead to both enhanced proliferation and failures in hollow lumen formation in three dimensional epithelial culture models, but it is not clear whether these failures in lumen formation are caused by any failure in the spatial coordination of lumen formation (hollowing) or purely a failure in the apoptosis and clearance of luminal cells (cavitation). Here, we use normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) epithelial cells, which form a hollow lumen without significant apoptosis, to compare the transformation by these four genetic changes. We find that either mutant PIK3CA expression or PTEN loss, but not mutant AKT1 E17K, cause disrupted epithelial architecture, whereas HER2 overexpression drives strong proliferation without affecting lumen formation in these cells. We also show that PTEN requires both lipid and protein phosphatase activity, its extreme C-terminal PDZ binding sequence and probably Myosin 5A to control lumen formation through a mechanism that does not correlate with its ability to control AKT, but which is selectively lost through mutation in some tumours. These findings correlate AKT-independent signalling activated by mutant PIK3CA or PTEN loss, but not strongly by HER2, with disrupted epithelial architecture and tumour formation."
https://openalex.org/W1972814805,"The Cullin4A (cul4A)-dependent ligase (CDL4A) E3 has been implicated in a variety of biological processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA damage response. Remarkably, CDL4A exerts its function through both proteolytic and non-proteolytic events. Here, we show that the p53 family member p73 is able to interact with the CDL4A complex through its direct binding to the receptor subunit DNA-binding protein 1 (DDB1). As a result, the CDL4A complex is able to monoubiquitylate p73. Modification of p73 by CDL4A-mediated ubiquitylation does not affect p73 protein stability, but negatively regulates p73-dependent transcriptional activity. Indeed, genetic or RNA interference-mediated depletion of DDB1 induces the expression of several p73 target genes in a p53-independent manner. In addition, by exploiting a bioinformatic approach, we found that elevated expression of Cul4A in human breast carcinomas is associated with repression of p73 target genes. In conclusion, our findings add a novel insight into the regulation of p73 by the CDL4A complex, through the inhibition of its transcriptional function."
https://openalex.org/W2001070446,"Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide plays a pivotal role in neuroprotection against stroke-related brain injury. However, the regulatory mechanism on CART transcription, especially the repression mechanism, is not fully understood. Here, we show that the transcriptional repressor neuron-restrictive silencer elements (NRSF, also known as REST) represses CART expression through direct binding to two NRSF-binding elements (NRSEs) in the CART promoter and intron 1 (named pNRSE and iNRSE, respectively). EMSA show that NRSF binds to pNRSE and iNRSE directly in vitro. ChIP assays show that NRSF recruits differential co-repressor complexes including CoREST and HDAC1 to these NRSEs. The presence of both NRSEs is required for efficient repression of CART transcription as indicated by reporter gene assays. NRSF overexpression antagonizes forskolin-mediated up-regulation of CART mRNA and protein. Ischemia insult triggered by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) enhances NRSF mRNA levels and then NRSF antagonizes the CREB signaling on CART activation, leading to augmented cell death. Depletion of NRSF in combination with forskolin treatment increases neuronal survival after ischemic insult. These findings reveal a novel dual NRSE mechanism by which NRSF represses CART expression and suggest that NRSF may serve as a therapeutic target for stroke treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2096635629,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between bacteria occurs in the intestinal tract of their animal hosts and facilitates both virulence and antibiotic resistance. A model in which both the pathogen and the host are genetically tractable facilitates developing insight into mechanistic processes enabling or restricting the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. Here we develop an in vivo experimental system to study HGT in bacteria using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model host. Using a thermosensitive conjugative system, we provide evidence that conjugation between two Escherichia coli strains can take place in the intestinal lumen of N2 wild-type worms at a rate of 10(-3) and 10(-2) per donor. We also show that C. elegans age and genotype are important determinants of the frequency of conjugation. Whereas ∼1 transconjugant for every 100 donor cells could be recovered from the intestine of N2 C. elegans, for the age-1 and tol-1 mutants, the detected rate of transconjugation (10(-3) and 10(-4) per donor cell, respectively) was significantly lower. This work demonstrates that increased recombination among lumenal microbial populations is a phenotype associated with host aging, and the model provides a framework to study the dynamics of bacterial horizontal gene transfer within the intestinal environment."
https://openalex.org/W2041726130,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis whose expression suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Like many angiogenesis-related genes, TSP-1 expression is tightly controlled by various mechanisms, but there is little data regarding the contribution of post-transcriptional processing to this regulation. NOL7 is a novel tumor suppressor that induces an antiangiogenic phenotype and suppresses tumor growth, in part through upregulation of TSP-1. Here we demonstrate that NOL7 is an mRNA-binding protein that must localize to the nucleoplasm to exert its antiangiogenic and tumor suppressive effects. There, it associates with the RNA-processing machinery and specifically interacts with TSP-1 mRNA through its 3'UTR. Reintroduction of NOL7 into SiHa cells increases luciferase expression through interaction with the TSP-1 3'UTR at both the mRNA and protein levels. NOL7 also increases endogenous TSP-1 mRNA half-life. Further, NOL7 post-transcriptional stabilization is observed in a subset of angiogenesis-related mRNAs, suggesting that the stabilization of TSP-1 may be part of a larger novel mechanism. These data demonstrate that NOL7 significantly alters TSP-1 expression and may be a master regulator that coordinates the post-transcriptional expression of key signaling factors critical for the regulation of the angiogenic phenotype."
